d *i d&quot;(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT). SECRET.CP. 552(24) CABINET. yHOME AFFAIRS COMMITTEE. MILK DISTRIBUTION (ASCERTAINMENT OF COSTS AND PROFITS) BILL. Memorandum by the President of the Board of ,Trade.I re-submit to my colleagues a memorandum whioh I circulated to the Cabinet in October, 1923, during the last Conservative administration, covering a first draft of a Bill for giving effeot to the racommendation of the Linlithgew Committee in regard ts the ascertainment of distributers&apos; oosts and profits.At the meeting last autumn between the National Farmers&apos; Union and the distributing trade, the wholesale prices for Milk were fixed at 1/6^ per gallon for October 1924 - March, 1925, &apos;an4 at - l/- per gallon for April 1925 - September 1925,As to retail prices, the &quot;Combine&quot; fixed the price ef &quot;Milk-in Londsn at 7fd. per quart from October 1st for the winter. However, the London and Provincial Dairymen&apos;s Association, whioh claims to be &quot;free of the Combine&quot;, and to have a large member-ship in London, though weak in the Provinces, - subsequently fixed the price of Milk in London at 7d. per quart from October 1st for the winter.     The &quot;Combine&quot; then decided to fix the prica. in London at 7d. per quart for October, November and March,and at 8d. per quart for December, January and February.    In fact, however, the increase to 8d. in December does not appear to have been made   and the. Times announced on December 2nd that &quot;the retail price of milk sold in Lyndon  by United Dairies, &quot;Limited, which was to have been increased yesterday, will &quot;remain unchanged until further notice at 7d, a quart&quot;.     The London and Provincial Association appears, thus, to have been able t* force the &quot;Combine&quot; to reduce their price for the
present, but It remains to be seen whether this will last throughout January and February.The Cabinet, as stated in the minutes, &quot;approved in principle the introduction of a Bill confined in its scope to Milk and &quot;drawn in accordance with the recommendations of the Linlithgow Committee, empowering the Board of Trade to take action to force the Milk Combine to disclose its accounts, the details of the Bill to be settled by the Home Affairs Committee&quot;,It will be recollected that reference to a Bill on this subject was made in the King&apos;s Speech;   and in view of pressure which is being brought to bear on the Government to take action on the Committee&apos;s recommendations, I suggest that the attached Bill which is in a later form, in which it was drawn by Parliamentary Counsel in December, 1923, should be referred to the Home Affairs Committee, with a view to introduction at an early opportunity after the Recess,(Intld.)

&apos; 0 A B I N,E- Tv MILK PRICES AND THE MILK COMBINE. ,MEMORANDUM; BY THE - PRESIDENT OP THE&apos;BOARD OP TRADE- 1 The Report of the Linlithgow Committee on Milk 1 Prices, issued in April, 19S3, cannot he ignored.The importanoe of the question to the health of the oountry is summed up in paragraph&apos;142 as followss-^Finally, we have reoeived abundant evidence that the consumer is influenced more by prices than by statements of dietetio values. Henoe lower prioes mean more milk consumed,   The average consumption of milk by a&apos; large proportion of the infants and ohildren in this oountry is authoritatively stated to be entirely inadequate to physiological needs.   Taking the population as awhple, the per capita consumption of liquid milk is estimated to be less than half of %hat obtaining in other progressive oountries such as the United states.   We have been informed that a-deorease in prioe of Id. a quart results in an increase in consumption of as muoh. as 15 to 20 per oent., and henoe any such increased consumption compensates distributors by reducing the quantity of surplus milk to be manufactured at a loss.   Any effective increase in consumption per head should also tend to oheapen the unit cost of delivery.&quot;Under the agreement between the National Farmers&apos;Union and the National Federation of Dairymen&apos;sAssociations in September, 1922, the prioe paid to the farmer for liquid milk delivered in London waB.-Ootober, 1922 -March, 1923 - l/8 per gallon. April, 1923 - September, 1923    if- per gallon.This was retailed to the consumer at October, 1922 -Maroh, 1923 - 8d. per quart ^- 2/8 per gallon, April, 1923 - September, 1923 - 6d. per quart = 2/-per gallon.The distributive margin in the London area and many other parts of the oountry was roughly 4d. per gallon to the wholesaler and 8d. to the retailef - l/- per gallonj that
to say the distributors reoeived exactly as much for the distribution of milk as the farmers reoeived in the summer for producing it.The Committee reported that the margin of 4d. per gallon to the wholesaler was in their opinion excessive, that the margin of 8d. per gallon to the London retailer was not excessive for the small retailer whose sole trade Is in liquid milk, but that the United Dairies (the Milk Combine) could retail milk cheaper by reason of their superior organisation, though to do so would ultimately drive out the small retailer.It may be observed however that this result postulates continued inefficiency and absence of combination among the small traders.The United Dairies, Limited, was formed in 1915 with a capital of a million pounds, for the purpose of aoquiring some of the principal London wholesale milk businesses and their country oreameries.   In 1917 the Company decided to enter the London retail milk business, and some of the largest milk distributing businesses were acquired.   To enable this transaction to be completed the issued oapital was increased to about  2,300,000.   In 1920 the issued oapital had reached  3,280,000 through the absorption of numerous other companies and private traders, and to-day the issued oapital stands at approximately  4,000,000.The United Dairies sell 65$ of the wholesale and 30$ of the retail milk supply of Londone   They are the dominant force in the National Federation of Dairymen1s-Associations through whose members 95$ of London milk Is supplied.   They therefore control the London prioes, and other distributors have to follow their lead.   But their influence is not confined to the metropolis. It is hardly too much to say that it is the dominating faotor in milk prices in the Home Counties and still further afield.   Other distributors oan in no way be said to provide effective competition
against the Milk Combine.   The Combine tolerates them because, in the words of the Committee, they provide effective &quot;cover from fire&quot; and &quot;cover from view&quot; for its operations*   By reason of their inferior organisation the small Distributors can only retail milk at higher prioes and the United Dairies is content to let them oontinue to do this, taking a bigger profit for -itself.The position is explained by the Committee in paragraphs 100 to 107 of their Report which are reproduced in the Appendix to this memorandum.In effect the Committee report that the United Dairies in the half-year ending 30th September, 1922, made a profit at the rate of 13$ per annum on their nominal oapital, but this bears no relation to their real profit, whioh is disguised by watered oapital, subsidiary companies, eto.   They accordingly reeommend the introduetion of legislation to compel holding companies which stand in a similar position to file with their annual returns particulars from whioh their real profits could be ascertained.The Committee draw a striking contrast between the oosts in glasgow and in London,   In Glasgow the distributive margininstead of being l/- per gallon as in London was 9d* per gallon(3-jkU to the wholesaler and 5%&amp;* to the retailer).   The Committeeconclude, in paragraph 133i-&quot;Por this reason we oonsider that the charge for distribution in future is oapable of marked reduction from the nominal sum of Is. per gallon which is at present operative in London and other plaoes, and where the nominal margin may be less, proportionate reductions shou.\d be made. We have already expressed our view that the wholesale portion of the distributive margin is, in any event, unduly high in oases where it amounts to as much as 3jd. and 4d. per gallon.   We considerf therefore, that, so far as London is conoerned and on the assumption that the residuary retail margin of 8d. is not oapable of immediate reduction - though in Glasgow a margin of 5-jrd. appears to suffice for that purpose - nothing less than a substantial reduction of the wholesale portl on of the margin will meet the case in future having regard to the changed conditions.&quot;
In view of the findings of the Committee^ on July 17th last, in oonjunotion with the Minister of Health, the Minister of Agriculture, the secretary for sootland and the Minister of Labour, I called a oonferenoe at whioh representatives of the milk distributive trade and the National Farmers&apos; Union met us. At this oonferenoe the whole field of the Committee&apos;s Report was discussed,   I invited the distributors to make some   ! proposals in regard to the reduction of the retail prioe of liquid milkj and I oalled attention to the arguments adduoed by the Committee.   The United Dairies, after an ineffective attempt to show that the Glasgow servioes were inefficient, fell back on a general traverse of the findings of the Committee and a blank refusal to disclose any particulars of their accounts, coupled with a somewhat hypocritical appeal to the interests of the small trader.     With the approval of my colleagues, 1 warned the Combine that failure on their part to make substantial reduotions in prioe, would probably necessitate the introduction of legislation.There the matter rested until the time oame for the renewal of the agreement between the National Farmers&apos; Union and the Distributive Trad-?, by which milk prioes are fixed from 1st October to 50th September each year.   As a result of negotiations, the joint Committee of Produoers and Distributors arrived at an agreement under whioh the public will pay fd. a- quart less for milk during tho opming Winter than they paid last Winter.   The farmer is to be paid for milk delivered in London during October, November, and Maroh, ls.5d. per gallonj for Deoember, January, and February lB.8d., while the retail prioe for the former period is to be 7d. per quart, and 8d. per quart for the latter. In the six summer months it was decided that the price to the producer should be Is. per gallon, and that the retail prioe should be 6d, per quart.   This is a much smaller reduction in prioe than the Linlithgow Committee suggested could be borne by the distributors alone, and 75$ of the cost of it is foisted
upon the farmers.     This is direotly flouting the Linlithgow Committee and the Government and, in my opinion, is a bad oase of a middleman&apos;s trust squeezing both the produoer and the consumer in a vital article of food.It is not too much to say that the allegation which oaused The Minister of Agriculture to appoint the Linlithgow Committee has been proved.   A distributive Combine which refuses to publish its accounts admits making a- profit of Y&amp;fo, on a oapital generally understood to be watered, while on the other hand, agrioulture is making no suoh profit and the. public are unable to afford the amount of milk that national health requires.-1 do not believe that public opinion will tolerate the continuance of this, and I think that the Government should adopt the reoommendation of the Linlithgow Committee and foroe the Milk Combine to disclose its accounts.   Legislation direoted against trusts Is notoriously difficult to make effeotlve, but I-have had the matter examined in my Department) and I am satisfied that we can introduce a Bill that would aohieve something in the direction desired.     The draft, of which I attach a copy, empowers the Board of Trade to require any company dealing in the distribution of milk to furnish particulars as to the situation of their subsidiary companies and the nature and extent of their interest therein.   It empowers the Board of Trade to oall for particulars as to the quantity and oost prioe&quot;of milk purchased, expenses of distribution and the quantities and sale price of:the-milk sold, with similar powers in regard to the disposal of &quot;surplus&quot; milk for manufacture.   Finally, the draft empowers the Board of Trade to put a chartered accountant in to investigate the holding or subsidiary companies&apos; books bo that a report may be made as to the exact costs shd profits of the business.The Bill is entirely confined in its scope to milk. The oase for legislation with regard to this oommodity is
established on the faotsj and I think that we should be on strong ground in confining legislation of such a-drastio character to oases where actual investigation has shown such a course to be necessary.   As the industry is not in competition with foreign countries the question of disclosure of information to rivals abroad does not arise.If it be asked what benefit the Government hope to gain from the Bill the answer is that it is extremely desirable that in such a vital commodity as milk the publio should be placed in possession of the full facts as to its distributive costss   Pull disclosure of accounts when required will in itself benefit producer and consumero     The disclosure of aotual cost and profit will show the consumer to what extent he is being overcharged and the producer to what extent he is being bled.     It will strengthen the produoer in negotiation and stimulate co-operation among farmers *   The force of public opinion should itself be enough to make the Combine take aotion and relieve us from the necessity of imposing a form of oontrol or municipalisation.I- therefore ask for authority to introduce in the Autumn Session a bill on the general lines of the attached draft, the precise details to be settled by the Home Affairs Committee.(Intld.) P.Lla-G.20th Ootober, 1923.
APPENDIX.Paragraphs from the Linlithgow Report dealing with the Milk Combine.A dividend equal to 9.36 per cent, on its total issued capital - Ordinary and Preference - was paid by the United Dairies for the financial year ended the 30th June, 1922. This dividend of course ignores undistributed profits;   the issued capital is partly represented by goodwill and benefit of contracts.     We have not been informed what was the precise amount originally represented by this goodwill and benefit of contracts, but it must have borne a very high proportion to the working assets.     Our examination of the accounts submitted for the half-year ended 30th September, 1922, shows that the total combined profits (milk and other goods ) earned by the wholesale and retail groups of subsidiary milk businesses were at the rate of approximately 13 per cent, per annum on the capital invested therein, including the balance of goodwill, etc.     For various reasons, the period under review was, we understand, relatively unsatisfactory from a profit-earning standpoint.     It is, therefore, impossible to draw definite conclusions from an examination of these accounts, particularly owing to the far-reaching effect of seasonal variations on trading results.     It is Instructive to note, however, that -jjj-d. per gallon yields a profit of 6 per cent, on the capital invested by the Company in the milk business at the present time.There is admittedly an element of danger in the continuance of the present arrangement under which the control of so large a proportion of the milk supply of London is vested in one concern.     We observe, for instance, that the provincial wholesale company of the United Dairies appears to act, in some cases, as the channel for the milk bought by the subsidiary companies for manufacture into such products as condensed milk, and that, no charge is made to the manufacturing companies for fixing up the contracts, bookings and any other services which may be rendered.     Similarly, we observe that, as in the case of many other milk concerns, the proportion of the total expenses of the Company&apos;s retail businesses charged to the sale of &quot;other goods&quot;, which are, in some cases, the Company&apos;s own manufactured articles, is less than, In our view, the circumstances warrant.     These may not be matters of paramount importance, and, in any case, they are questions of internal regulation which lie entirely within the discretion of the parent undertaking.   They illustrate, however, the obvious possibilities of the system of amalgamating industry by the formation of &quot;holding&quot; companies.In this case, the system affords an opportunity for the Company, at the expense of the consumer of liquid milk, to place its own manufactured article on the market at less cost, and, therefore,&apos;if it so desires, to dispose of it at a cheaper rate than is possible for competitive products.     No doubt this would be a sound business arrangement, the effect of which, in course of time, would be to drive other manufacturers out of the market.     We find, however, that as regards condensed milk, these manufacturers are the Company1s main competitors for the farmers&apos; milk in certain districts, and their disappearance would, therefore, react unfavourably on producers generally, while enabling the Company to extend its ramifications and to fortify its already predominant position in the milk trade generally./ -7-
91:9 t) t) 6105. The illustrations we have quoted imply that, with a moreequitable adjustment of coats, the return derived by the Company from the liquid milk trade alone would be greater than it is at present.   We have no doubt that this is so.   It follows, therefore, that the Company oould have retailed milk at a some-what oheaper average rate than that whioh prevailed during 1923. Other retailers would, however, have been compelled to do the same, and, if the wholesale prioe of milk had been maintained, this course would have tended to drive out of business the small independent trader dealing in milk alone who works on the edge of the profit margin, and who relies on the wholesaler for his supplies.104. We fully appreciate the reluctance of the Company to take any action that would lead to this result.   It has long been oustomary for large business amalgamations to seek to preserve, in their own interests, the small trader whose operative oosts are neoessarily heavy in relation to the volume of his business. Ho ensures for the big combination both &quot;cover from view&quot; and &quot;oover from fire&quot;.   It is true that he is usually left the least remunerative portion of the trade, and that his continued existenoeseems to be satisfying to public opinion, but to imagine that he is effeotive as a competitive agent is fallacious. Further, in so far as the distribution of milk is oonoerned, It is arguable that he represents an unnecessary Investment both of oapital and labour in the milk trade generally.105. We foresee the possibility, therefore, that in course oftime, the public   demand for a oheaper milk supply may lead to the disappearanoe of the smaller trader.   While this would correspondingly strengthen the position of all large milk businesses in London, it would obviously react most effectively in favour of the United Dairies.   In these circumstances, and having regard to the virtual monopoly already enjoyed by the Company in the London wholesale trade, which, of itself, must enable it to control indirectly consumer&apos;s prioes generally in the London area, it would appear desirable that the consuming public   should be able readily to ascertain whether the price oharged by the Company for fresh milk, is, at any time, inflated by the cost of auxiliary servioes rendered to its subsidiary under, r* takings, or by a higher rate of net profit than may be considered reasonable.   Indeed, the Company may, in its own Interests, desire, to increase public confidence by supplying Information, from time &apos; to time, on these fundamental points.106.Wo do not consider that the situation warrants any suoh expedients as the- nationalisation or muniolpalisation of supplies, or the formation of Publio Utility Undertakings.   We are, however, impressed by the fact that the formation of companies intended mainly to hold the securities of and receive dividends from merged companies results in considerable obscurity as to the preoiso financial position of the associated undertakings. In the oase of the United Dairies, for instance, the whole of the fihare oapital in the subsidiary oompanies is held by the parent company, and, as it largely finanoes the operations of these oompanies, the share capital of the subsidiary oompanies oannot be taken to indicate the actual amount invested in the respeotive conoerns. As private oompanies within the meaning of the Oompanies . I.(Consolidation; Act, 1908, the Balanoe Sheets of the subsidiary companies are not required to be filed at Somerset House, and, as they were not inoluded among the accounts submitted for our Information, they are, therefore, not available for reference.
The Balance Sheet of tho parent   Company      which has to be filed, gives no information as to the book-value of the goodwill, the amount paid for benefit of contracts, the fixed and floating assets, or the amount of the liabilities, reserves, end undistributed profits standing in the books of the subsidiary undertakings.     fte understand that the sums paid for goodwill vary, but that the original companies coming into the amalgamation were acquired on the basis of 5g years&apos; purchase of the average adjusted profits.     It will be realised that the value placed on goodwill and other Intangible assets has a bearing on the profits required to be earned in order to maintain dividends, and these have to be provided out of the margin between the price paid to the producer and that paid by the consumer.107. we, therefore, recommend that the Government should consider the a-ivisability of introducing legislation to require holding companies which stand in a position similar to that of the United Dairies to file with their annual returns at Somerset House, a co-ordinated Balance Sheet showing inter . alia how much of their capital is represented by (a) goodwill and other intangible assets, (b) fixed assets and (c) floating assets, and the aggregate amounts of their (d) liabilities, (e) reserves and (f) profits.
