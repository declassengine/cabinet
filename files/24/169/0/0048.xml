in.SUBMISSION OF BUSINESS TO THE CABINET.At a Meeting of the Cabinet held on November 12th,1924, it was agreed:-&quot;That the question of granting approval to the arrangements made by the previous Government in regard to the submission of business to the Cabinet should be left in the hands of the Prime Minister,&quot;The Prime Minister subsequently instructed the secretary that Treasury Circular No, 11/24,&apos; dated April 28th, 1924,should be re-circulated, with a view to the continuance of theprocedure provided for therein,(Cabinet 59 (24)., Conclusion 1 (f)).The Circular referred to above was later re-circulated to all Departments by the Secretary to the Treasury (Treasury Circular No. 22.B/24 dated November 17th, 1924), a copy of which is attached.-4-
Further copies of this circular may be obtained upon application on the usual Form of Demand at H.M. Stationery Office, Shepherdess Walk, City Road, N.l.No. 22b/24.Treasury Chambers, F. 6064. iSM*J Whitehall, S.W.17th November, 1924.SUBMISSION OF BUSINESS TO THE CABINET.CABINET DECISION AS TO PROCEDURE.Sir,I am directed by the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty&apos;s Treasury to acquaint you for the information ofthat H.M. Government had before them at the meeting of the Cabinet on the 12th instant the Circular No. 11/24 of the 28th April last on the above subject.A copy of that Circular is printed hereunder and I am to state that H.M. Government have decided that the procedure therein indicated shall continue to be observed in its entirety.I am, Sir,&apos; Your obedient Servant,N. P. WARREN Fisher.No. 11/24.TREASURY CHAMBERS,WHITEHALL, S.W.28tfc April, 1924.SlE,I am directed by the Lords Commissioners of H.M. Treasury to acquaint you, for the information of , that H.M. Governmenthave had under careful consideration the question of insuring that the Cabinet and Cabinet Committees shall be invited to reach decisions only after the subject referred to the Cabinet has been thoroughly examined between each of the various Public Departments concerned.This elementary rule of business is essential if the Cabinet and its Committees are to have available all the facts and points of view requisite for an enlightened decision and are to be saved the possibility of hasty or uninformed conclusions.The observance of the rule is the more obligatory under modern conditions when the mass of Government business has so enormously increased, and as a consequence Govern-ments can only get through it efficiently if the issues presented for decision have been carefully investigated beforehand by the Departments in collaboration.The Cabinet feels sure that Departments are anxious to assist it in securing the observance of this rule, and has come to the conclusion that the desired object will be facilitated by the following procedure. In future all memoranda, draft Bills and other constituents of the Agenda will be sent to the Cabinet Secretariat for circulation only after their subject-matter has been fully examined between the Departments from which they emanate, the Treasury, the Law Officers where contentious Bills are involved, and any other Department concerned, and these documents will bear on the face of them a specific statement that this examination has taken place. The documents should be made as complete as possible by containing the various arguments and criticisms which might be brought against the proposals advocated. To enable the members of the Cabinet (and Cabinet Committees) to have time to consider proposals intended for Cabinet; decision and in view also of the possibility that such inter-Departmental examination may result in definite differences of opinion necessitating the preparation of memoranda by, the dissenting Department or Departments, no memoranda, draft Bills, etc., which originate proposals for Cabinet decision will be placed on the Agenda until an interval of at least five days has elapsed after circulation, except on any occasion when the Prime Minister expressly authorises a relaxation of the rule.I am, Sir,Your obedient Servant,N.
