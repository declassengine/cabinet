CONFMEHCrJ ON AGRICULTURAL POLICY.   -1. The Government has given careful considerationto the question of the action that should be taken to deal with the agricultural problem,2. There have been many previous Inquiries into theposition of agriculture in recent years, notably by Lord Selborne&apos;s Committee on Agricultural Policy and by the Agricultural Tribunal of Investigation.     Much valuable material and information is contained in their Reports, but hitherto It haa not been possible to obtain agreement either in the industry itself or by the country as a whole as to the main principles of a national and stable agricultural policy.3. The Government is, however, deeply impressed with the vital importance of the basic industry &quot;of agriculture in the national economy, and it is of opinion that a fresh attempt should be made to arrive at an agreement as to the measures which are necessary to secure the objects which all parties in the country unite&apos;in desiring, 40 Those objects are that the industry should be conducted in such a manner as will secure the maximum employment of labour at reasonable rates of wages, together with the full use of the land for the production of food at the lowest possible prices consistent with a fair return to all those engaged in the industry,,     Unless these objects can be simultaneously attained, no measures for the relief of agriculture or for the assistance of any particular section of the industry, will secure the lasting support of the industrial population of the country, and from .the point of view of the workers in the industry no measures for the statutory regulation
of wages will in themselves enable wages to be paid that are In fact uneconomic,5. If, however, agreement could be arrived at as tothe measures which would secure the objects mentioned above, the Government is of opinio.. that it could be presented to the country with a good prospect of acceptance.     Prom the point of view of labour the decline of agriculture is a serious menace to employment in other industries and has a depressing effect on wages, and the whole population as consumers of food is vitally interested in the maintenance of a properous agriculture without which the supply of home produced food is bound to *tee*ba?ne .     Prom the social point of view also the maintenance of a healthy rural population is of the first importance, and the Chief Medical Officer of the Board of Education has in his recent Report lent his authority to some disquieting observations which suggest that in some parts of the country there is a deoline in the general physique of many country children,     Inssfar as this decline may be a reaction from the general agricultural problem, it strongly enforces the necessity of making every effort to effect an improvement in agricultural conditions.6. On these grounds the Government has decided, asan initial step, to summon a Conference of representatives of the three-principal agricultural interests, viz., landowners, farmers and workers, in the hope that by concerted discussion and inquiry such a Conference will arrive at agreed conclusions as to the main features of a national agricultural policy, which would give confidence and stablity to the industry and would be likely to be acceptable to the country as a whole.
7. The Government realises that any such Conferencemust be supplied with as clear and precise a statement as possible of the means which must be adopted in order to attain the objects set out in paragraph 4 above, 8. In the opinion of the Government, it is of primary importance to maintain and if possible increase the area of arable land.   The cultivation of arable land as compared with permanent grass may be said in broad terms to provide employment for a greater number of men and also to give a larger amount of saleable agricultural produce per acre1.   The maintenance and extension of the arable area corresponds, therefore, with the national needs by providing a greater production of food and greater employment&apos;,9&apos;, The Government accordingly proposes that the referenceto the Conference should be to. consider what measures, if any/ are necessary either by the State, or by the agricultural industry Itself or by both in concert (1), to maintain and (2). to. increase the area of arable land in Bn^land and Wales, and by what furtheritmeasures the economic maximum production, of food from all, the, agricultural JLand of, the country can be stimulated, 10* It will not be necessary for the Conference to enterinto a detailed examination of questions of food prices as these have already been considered by the Linlithgow Committee and have been referred for further examination to a Royal Commission, 11, In considering the reference, too much weight shouldnot be given to the production of wheat to the exclusion of other arable crops1.   Land in arable cultivation can, in an emergency, be diverted to wheat, and in normal times it is not in itself a national necessity, on grounds of defence or otherwise, to grow wheat to an extent greater than is economically profitable.   What is required is the maintenance of land in arable cultivation together with the.necessary farming experience, the supply of skilled agricultural labour and the implements, buildings and
SHRBwnmaamammtujHmtdrainage which will enable that land to be devoted to wheat growing if the necessity arises.12, In regard to the maintenance of the existing arablearea, which is now practically the same as it was prior to the War, the Government desires the Conference to consider, and report whether under present conditions it is likely that it will be substantially reduced and,iif so, to what extent-, in the absence of any positive steps to arrest any further decline.   If the Conference comes to the conclusion that the area will be reduced they are invited to indicate what measures would be effective to prevent it. 15, The Government also desires the Conference toreport what further measures would have to be taken in order to secure an increase in the existing area of arable land,&apos; having due regard to the necessary limitations of soil and climate1.   For this purpose it is suggested that any measures recommended should be sufficient to secure an addition of not less than 1,000,000 acres to the area of arable land, which would be an increase of approximately 10 per cent&apos;, 14, The Conference should also bear in mind the factthat the problem is not merely one of acreage.   It is even more important that any measures recommended should be designed to secure the highest possible standard of profitable production from all the land of the country, whether arable or grass.   It cannot be doubted that there is room for great improvement particularly in regard to the productive capacity of grassland.   There has been too much tendency to consider the agricultural problem in terms of corn growing alone, whereas the live stock Industry, in its wide sense, including meat of all kinds, milk, butter, cheese, poultry and eggs accounts at the present time for probably three-fourths of the total annual value of the agricultural production of the country, while potatoes together with fruit and vegetables represents another 10 per cent,4.
An increase of these forma of production though not in all cases affecting the problem of employment so directly, is, in the opinion of the Government^ of very great importance in the national Interest,15&apos;. It is the intention of the Government in callingthe Conference to give the industry itself an opportunity of formulating for the consideration of the country as a whole a policy which will secure the attainment of the objects indicated above, and it is hoped that as the period of acute depression since the War appears to be over and as the agricultural outlook is now brighter the Conference will be enabled to consider the problem in an atmosphere undisturbed by abnormal   conditions or by demands for emergency measures of relief1.16,       -  The Government considers that the Conference should be responsible for its own proceedings and conclusions, but it will be glad to place at the disposal of the Conference any information or statistics in its possession,&apos; and to afford any other assistance in its power.Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries. 24th November, 1924&apos;,
