Cabinet.10ret.P. 529 (24)HORTHERH IRELAND LAND BILL.Memorandum by the Home Secretary.The Home Affairs Oommittee at their meeting of 5th December recommended the   immediate introduction of this Bill, and I circulate this note for the information of the Cabinet.The Bill was originally drafted by instruction of the previous Conservative Government (see Cabinet Minute   of the 1st August 1923).     It was introduced into the House of Commons by the Labour Government in July 1924.The completion of Land Purchase in Ireland was a question examined by a Sub-Committee of the Irish Convention in 1917. The report of the Sub-Committee was a unanimous one, agreed to by representatives of both landlords and tenants, and was accepted by the Convention.In 1922 a Committee, of which Lord Eustace Percy was Chairman, was appointed to consider what should be the terms of future land purchase in Northern Ireland.    This Committee confined themselves to considering how best the principles of land purchase unanimously accepted by the Convention could be adapted to the circumstances of the moment, having regard specially to the fall in the rate of interest for Government borrowing.     The present Bill is based on the report of Lord Eustace Percy&apos;s Committee.As Land Purchase is a &quot;reserved&quot; service, the Imperial Parliament only (and not the Parliament of Northern Ireland) can legislate on the subject, but the financial burden imposed by the Bill will ultimately be borne by the Government Of Northern Ireland:    and the Bill was drafted in consultation with them.It is understood that the landlords of Northern Ireland
6th December, 1924.9Z18-9are still ready to accept the Ball, but in view of the better terms granted to tenants in the Free State there has been some agitation among tenants in Sorthern Ireland for similar terms.     The Government of Northern Ireland are not prepared to find the additional money which would be required to give better terms to the tenants, and they are anxious that the Bill should be proceeded with:    it is understood that the Northern Ireland members will support the Bill as it stands.W.J.H.
