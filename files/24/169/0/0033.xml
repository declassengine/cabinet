DOCUMENT 13 THE PROPERTY OF HIS BFiTTAilMIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT) .CRET, . 532 (24).CABIN E T.UNEMPLOYMENT C OMIT TEE EREPORT ON ASSISTANCE TO SHIPBUILDING BY MEANS OP &quot;TRA*DE FACILITIES GUARANTEES&quot;!1.     The Unemployment Committee desire to submit to the Cabinet the results of recent examination by the Committee of the question of the utilisation of the machinery of the Trade Facilities Acts for the assistance of shipbuilding in Great Britain.2,     Prom the autumn of 1921, when the first Trade   Facilities Act came into force, until the spring of the present year, it was the practice of the Trade Facilities Advisory Committee to grant to Shipowners who were ready to satisfy the Committee&apos;s normal conditions, facilities under the Acts for the construction of new tonnage whether liners, tramps or speacialised vessels, such as tankers, etc.     Up to April, 1924, out of a total of  44,000,000 credit guaranteed under their statutory powers, approximately  13,000,000 had been actually or provisionally allocated by the Committee to shipbuilding.     As a result, however, of strong representations made in the Debates in Committee on the Trade Facilities Bill of 1924 (see particularly Hansard 1924 Vol. 172, 1193 - 1244) assurances were given by the late Government that the Advisory Committee would look with the greatest caution upon any future shipping applications and in point of fact no further new guarantees have since been given by the Committee to the industry.     The question is whether the Government should now revert to their former policy and if so whether any special conditions should be imposed upon applications.- 1 - &quot;&quot;
iOKEHTS lINST MING PRESENT ICY.3,     The main arguments in favour of the maintenance of the present embargo may be briefly summarised as follows:-(l)   Prom the shipowners&apos; point of view acceleration is neither necessary nor desirable and there is already sufficient tonnage afloat.     While some of this is obsolete the healthy thing is to allow surplus tonnage to work itself offj   to stimulate production in advance of demand would seriously depreciate the existing assets of shipping Companies. (2)    If building with the help of the Trade Facilities Act is artificial this means postponement of the date when normal building at economic cost is undertaken. (3)    If the Trade Facilities Scheme attracts business which would not otherwise be attracted it may be the wrong sort of business,     Both the shipowner and shipbuilding industries would suffer from the entry of the wrong type of owner.GUMENTS 4. On the other hand the following reasons in favour of FAVOURREVERTING a change of oolicy have been submitted to the Committee :-TIERMER (a)   Shipbuilding is the industry which isLICY.suffering most acutely from unemployment. On the 27th October, 1924, the percentage unemployed in shipbuilding and ship repairing was 31.4, the actual number being 80,000 out of 255,000 insured.
Shipbuilding is also carried on in areas which show very high unemployment percentages as compared with the percentage (12.l) for the whole of Great Britain -- for example  AreaTynesidsWearTeesMerseyCiydesldePare enta ge. of ^Unemploy-!^Pi..gn]ong^aciuit..male ^r-Sd^uopulation^on lov,.. 1924.24.124.26.920.525.9The higher percentage of unemployment, the great difficulty of finding alternative work, particularly for the skilled men,and the sub-Stantial amount of employment resulting in those industries which furnish shipbuilding with its materials, themselves among the moat depressed, afford good nrima facie grounds for assisting the Industry, (b )   There is reason to believe that foreign orders for ships may be attracted to this country if the requisite Trade Facilities guarantees are forthcoming, otherwise the orders will be placed abroad.     British workmanship is better than foreign, end the difference in price at present in favour of the foreign yards, might be offset by the grant of Trade Facilities Guarantees.(o)    The argument that the wrong type of owner may be encouraged to build is open to the criticism that owners such as the Royal Mail steam Packet
ComparW, the Union Castle Company, the Glen line have taken substantial advantage of Trade Facilities-Guarantees.5.     After careful consideration the Committee, whilefully realising the objections which may be advanced byshipowners to any change of policy, consider that from thepoint of unemployment the present arrangements for assisting shipbuilding should be extended in the manner and subject to the safeguards indicated&apos; below.6.     The Committee accordingly recommend the Cabinet:-(l)   To approve the return to the policy as regards assistance to shipbuilding which obtained before the discussions in tho House of Commons last April. It being understood that this will mean that the considerations governing shipping guarantees will be the following, in addition of course to those dictated by ordinary business principles:-(i)   As regards applications from English Companies the trade Facilities Committee will be satisfied that there is real acceleration,(ii)   As regards applications from foreign shipowners the Cor;mittee will be satisfied that the Foreign shipowner would placo the order in any event but that as a result of the guaranteo the work vail be done in this country instead of abroad.(2) That arrangements should be made to notify Parliament of the new policy on an early occasion.R.B.
