SCHOOL TEACHERS (StJBSRAMTJATIQS) BILL,1.   In View of the discussion in the Cabinet on December 10th, in regard to Teachers&apos; Superannuation, I circulate this memorandum to my colleagues with a view to further discussion next week,2.   In 1918 the School Teachers (Superannuation) Act, 1918, was passed.   This Act provided for the superannuation of teachers in elementary and grant-aided schools on a basis very similar to that prevailing in the case of members of the Civil Service,    Ho con-tributiens were required either from teachers or employers, -3.   In 1922 the School Teachers (Superannuation) Act, 1922, was passed after a somewhat embittered controversy.     It provided that during the two years from 1st June, 1922, to the 1st June, 1924, teachers should make a contribution of 5 per cent, of the amount of their salaries towards the cost of providing their super-annuation benefits.      The contributions so paid were not funded and were applied as an appropriation in aid.   The reason why the Bill was made temporary was that almost contemporaneously the Treasury on 22nd August, 1922, appointed a Departmental Committee-under the Chairmanship of Lord Emmott to inquire what modifications were desirable in the system of superannuation established by the Act of 1918,4.   That Committee reported on 30th July, 1923, and their more&apos; important recommendations were:-(a) That the benefits given by the Act of 1918 should remain substantially unaltered.(b) That the teacher should contribute 5 per cent, and the era-ployers (i,e, the Local Authorities and Governing Bodies of Schools) 2l per cent, of salary to a fund and that the State should guarantee the payment of benefits01.
(e)   That teachers withdrawing from service without receiving benefits under the Scheme should be able to reclaim their contributions with 3 per cent, compound interest,5,    The Committee me.de many other detailed recommendations which did not very materially affect the main structure of the scheme.6,    In the Parliamentary Session of 1924 it became obvious that it would be impossible to past! legislation giving effect to the recommendations of the Emraott Committee or containing other legislative proposals as to superannuation before the Aot of 1922, which imposed the 5 per oont; contribution, expired on 1st June.    Consequently a Bill was introduced on 31ot March extending the operation of the Aot of 1922 till the 1st April, 1926, (for Scotland, its operation is extended only till 31st July, 1925).    Therefore, unless the system of contributions is to lapse altogether by the disappearance of the 1922 Bill, it becomes necessary to legislate in the Session of 1925.7.    The late Government had taken no steps to define their intentions in this matter, though they realised that legislation next year v/ould be necessary.    The Chancellor of the Exchequer has been in consultation reaently with the Secretary for Sootland and myself and we have agreed that legislation should be introduced on the main lines of the Emmott Report,    The Chancellor proposes, however, that contributions ehould not be funded but that a separate Account should be kept, provided with all the sanctity of a fund and conferring the same rights.   We need not trouble the Cabinet to consider this point at the moment,   There remains the question of contributions from local authorities.
8.     The amount of benefits payable under the Act of 1918 is estimated at about  4,000,000 for the year 9,9g5-ETC, and is at present growing by about  400,000 per annum.   The figure ultimately to be reached must depend upon tho future growth or decrease in the number of teachers and in their salary scales.   Upon a rather larger number of teachers than the present, and upon salary scales exceeding the present scales by 5 per cent, the Government Actuary has estimated that the cost of the Act of 1918 will be  9,600,000 in 1968-69 and sub-sequently, and that the cost of the new benefits proposed by Lord Bmmotfs Committee will by then have risen to  650,000 additional thereto.   A contribution from Local Authorities and other employers, of 2-j^ per cent, on salaries would amount to about  1,250,000 per annum.9.    If we were considering this matter for the first time have no doubt,   what superannuation scheme. I should--jr^commerid..Superannuation should be contributory, employer and employedmaking equal contributions. It 9hould be regarded as part ofthe salary, and the salary should be determined with referenceto it. These principles, applied to the present case, would indicate that the Local Authorities, who pay the salaries,should bear the whole employer&apos;s cost of superannuation (i.e.half the total cost) and that the Exchequer should pay grant,on this employer&apos;s cost as it pays grant on the cost of salaries.   Where the Exchequer bears 50 per cent, of the costof salaries, as in the case of secondary school teachers,the proportionswould be those recommended by the EmraottCommittee;   Teachers 5, Exchequer 2-&amp;, Local Authorities 2 .where the Exchequer boars 60 per cent.of the oost of salaries,ae in the case of elementary school teachers,the proportionwould be 5,3,2,* The Exchequer would act as guarantors,but itwould not be an independent party to superannuation any moreAuthorities asthan it is to salaries.   The responsibility of the Local^
employers would be undivided and the Jxoheuaer , would appear only as payers of a grant in aid of their expenditure.10.   Unfortunately, however, the position is prejudiced by the hiBtory of the past and by recent Events.      We have never followed these sound lineB of principle.    Local Authorities were not consulted in 1918 when Parliament granted such generouB superannuation benefitB.      The idea   that they might be called on to contribute to those benefits was never mentioned when they originally negotiated salary scales with the teachers in 1920, Ihe scales they then agreed to have set a standard from which they now find it diffioult to depart.      They have been trying to do so in the negotiations this year and were confidently relying&apos; on obtaining a reduotion of at least 12-  per cent.    They have recant-ljr had to abandon this hope, largely owing to the declarations as to salaries made during the Election.    The maiximum reduction they can now hope for will be less than the proposed contribution towardB superannuation, so that the rates will, if that contribution is required, actually have to bear an increased burden in respeot of teachers&apos; remuneration,    The teachers object to contributions from Local Authorities no less strongly than the Looal Authorities themselves, because they anticipate that, in the long run, they will have to bear the cost of any such contributions in the form of reduced salaries     In proposing such contributions to Parliament We shall, therefore, have to meet a united opposition and a strong argumentative case;   and I feel oertain that an announcement that we intend to exact contributions from Loaal Authorities will graven ly prejudice the pending arbitration on salaries.    Even if the salary arbitration went through and if we succeeded in forcing our Proposals through Parliament, the Looal Authorities, on whose oo-operation all improvement in education depends, would be left with a feeling that they had been treated unfairly^ and I am afraid education would suffer and our Party record with it.     In order to save our reoord we might be obliged to yield to a pressure,
.213which already exists, for an increase in the percentage rate of Exchequer Grants and the Exchequer might thus in the long run lose much, if not all, that it had gained by the 2  per oent, contribution.11.. My conclusion is that, in view of the past history of this question, an immediate saving to the Exchequer by the exaction of contributions from Local Authorities can probably not be secured, and, if Becured, would be purchased at too great a price,. I am by no means equally convinced that, if the Exchequer la prepared to forego an immediate saving, it might not be both possible and desirable to put through a scheme somewhat on the lines indicated in paragraph 9. above, i,e, on the understanding that temporarily, for a period long enough to enable teachers and Local Authorities to accommodate themselves to the prospect, the Board would recognise superannuation contributions for grant at the rate of 100 per cent.     This period might be one year longer than that fixed by Lord Burnham for the duration of his salary award, i.e, probably not less than four nor more than six years.     At the expiration of this period grant would be payable on superannuation contributions at the rate payable for the time being on salary expenditure.     This would, no doubt, be opposed, but it could not be held to be unfair, and it seems to me to be clearer and more logical than the division of responsibility proposed by the Emmott Committee, though its net effect would be much the same,12.   The position of Scotland is entirely different, both in its history and in its system of finanoe, and the above considerations must be read as applying only to England and Vales,E.P.11th December 1924,
