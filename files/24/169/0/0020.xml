(This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the use of the Cabinet.  December 1924.SECRET.CP. 518(24). 39ICABINET.INTER-ALLIED DEBTS. !Note by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.I VENTURE to reprint for the information of my colleagues a copy of a note relating to inter-Allied debts which I circulated to the then Cabinet in August 1922.&apos; This question is bound to loom very largely in the next six or twelve months, and my note will, I think, provide a useful starting point for our deliberations on the matter.(Initialled)        W. S. C.Treasury Chambers, S.W.1, December 2, 1924.(CP. 4149.) Inter-Allied Debts.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.THE financial effects hoped for from the Balfour note cannot possibly be produced unless that note remains for two or three years the unaltered policy of Great Britain. We have suffered hitherto by foreign countries thinking that, we have no will of our own in these matters. The United States has a will of its own, very clearly and obstinately expressed, namely, to exact payment from Great Britain. * France has a will of her own, equally clearly expressed, namely, to pay nobody. If Great Britain remains a sort of spongy, squeezable mass, on which these two conflicting wills may imprint their stamp, our fundamental interests will suffer. If, however, we show over a considerable period of time that, having declared our policy, we are prepared to stand by it firmly and calmly, no matter what foreign countries do or their backers in the British press say, other nations will be forced to take our will into consideration. It will become a factor in world affairs, and play its proper part in the general account.There is not the slightest doubt that the debts and reparations due to us, at their lowest valuation, will be worth 50 millions a year. Let European countries once feel that whatever they do or say, or whatever happens to their credit or currency, we are going to maintain a continuous demand for payment to this extent from them, and they will accommodate themselves to the idea. If the United States, while exacting payment from us, chooses to be lenient to our European debtors, our security in respect of these debtors is directly improved. I do not see why we should not next year endeavour to make arrangements with our European debtors by which their debts to us are scaled down to the 50 million annual limit. At any rate, a discussion on these lines should not be excluded from study. But the vital need appears to be that we should stand utterly, unmoved in the position- we have deliberately taken up.W. S. C.Colonial Office, August 3, 1922.[12344]
