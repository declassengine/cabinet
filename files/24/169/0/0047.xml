IgCRET. fc.P.546(24).C A &amp; I N E T.IMPERIAL ECONOMIC POLICY.Copy No,Memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture.., iWith reference to Item 10 upon the Agenda for the Cabinet tomorrow, I wish to direct the attention of my colleagues to the desirability of avoiding, if possiMe in connection with the announcement on this subject, misunderstanding in the minds of home producers.   Unless care is taken, the proposed policy will present itself to them as the granting of a subsidy for the better marketing of general Imperial products, many of which are in keen competition with their own.   At a moment whan political agricultural opinion is somewhat sensitive this would be unfortunate.   It may not be possible to avoid it altogether, but I think the risk would be minimised if -(1) it was possible to announce the policy without stating any definite figure5   if a million pounds is mentioned the matter assumes considerable proportions.(2) the Prime Minister, or whoever makes the announcement, could include in his statement some such words as the following&quot;In giving this assistance it is the hope and intention of tho Government that it should be used to enable the Dominions to seoura a larger share of that part of the home market which has to be supplied by importation from abroad. The Dominions have always recognised that our home producers have, and should always havo, the first place in the home market, but they ask, and we think rightly ask, that they should have preference over foreign countries as regards that part of the home market whioh cannot be supplied by the home producer&quot;*Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries. 16th December, 1924.flHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIO MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERHIMITJ.
