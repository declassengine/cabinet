(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OE HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S GOVERNMENT).SCHOOL TBACHflRS (SUPERANNUATION) BILL.OBSERVATIONS BY THE SECRETARY FOR SCOTLAND USf THE MSUQtlAKDUM BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OP EDUCATION (C.P.535(24)).1.   While, as the President explains the position of Scotland is entirely different, &quot;both in its history and its system of finance, the policy that may he adopted for England and Wales will necessarily determine the policy to he adopted for Scotland. In proof of this it is only necessary to recall the fact that, although the School Teachers (Superannuation) Act, 1918, applied to England and Wales, its passage compelled the immediate insti-tution of a similar Scheme of non-contributory pensions for teachers in Scotland, despite the fact that we had had in opera-tion there for seven years a contributory system with which all the parties concerned were completely satisfied.     Scotland&apos;s interest in the present discussion is therefore obvious.    Any figures which I may use, however, will of course refer to England and Wales only.2.   I concur generally in the Presidents narrative of the events that have led up to the present situation and I also con-cur generally as to the desirability of such a solution as he outlines in Paragraph 9 of the Memorandum.     I note, however,that he malces no references to a very important distinction, the keeping in view of which seems to me to be fundamental in any consideration of the problem.     I mean the distinction between payments in respect of &apos;back service&apos; or service given prior to the date of commencement of any new Scheme, and payments in res-pect of &apos;future service&apos; or service subsequent to the commence-ment of any such Scheme.gCRET.!,p. 545(24).C A B I N E T.
3.   In the present case the assumption &quot;by the Exchequer in 1918 of a huge &quot;&quot;back service&apos; liability is the root of the whole trouble.     In 1918 many of the more progressive Local Education Authorities in &quot;England and Walee had already made provision for many of the years of what is now &quot;back service&apos; by building up funds out of contributions made by themselves and their teachers. The Act of 1918, which placed the full responsibility for &apos;back service&apos; upon the Exchequer&apos;, at the same time directed that these local funds should be wound up so far as the teachers were oon-cerned, and their accumulated resources dissipated.    The Local Authorities would therefore have an unanswerable case in pleading now that there would be no justification for transferring to them any part of the weight of &apos;back service&apos; payments.4.   In Paragraph 7 the President refers to the question of funding and Bets it aside ao being apparently of secondary significance.     To me, on the other hand, it seems to lie at the root of the whole matter if, as the President says, it has been &quot;agreed that legislation should be introduced on the main lines of the Emmott Report&quot;,     That was clearly the unanimous view of the members of the Emmott committee.     They say (Para, 51) &quot;that a central fund, into whioh the contributions of the teachers and of the local authorities would automatically pass as received, should be regarded as an indispensable part of the machinery of the permanent scheme which we have adumbrated&quot;.     It may be taken as oertain that this pronouncement will be made much of during the discussions in Parliament.5.   Those concerned would not be slow to see that, unless the. Fund were a real Fund, its assets real assets, and the interest whioh was earned real interest, the money which they   . were paying to provide for their own future service&apos;, instead of being laid aBide for that purpose, waB simply being used to relieve the Exchequer of some part of its &apos;back service&apos; obliga-tions.
6.   I am entirely in favour of asking a contribution from Local Education Authorities towards the superannuation of their teachers.     The equity of such a proposal is bo manifest that I am confident it would he accepted by the Authorities themselves, if a properly constituted Fund were established.     If the place of such a Fund is to be taken by a Paper Account, the contributions would be used in relief of current expenditure,     Their exaction would thus simply be tantamount to a reduction of grant.7.     Logically, contributions from teachers are in precisely the same case.     If they are     funded, the levy is entirely just. If they are used in relief of current expenditure, they will again be stigmatised an a special form of supertax imposed on a not too affluent section of the community.     Without a Fund, therefore, there is all the material for a strong popular agitation, either now or in the future, for the entire abolition of teachers1 con-tributions.8.   To   many members of the present Parliament not the least attractive feature of the Emmott Recommendations is the provision which they suggeBt for the inclusion in the new Scheme of non-grant- earning schools,     I understand that the Preoident isjanxious to go farther and to extentvthe benefits even to pro-prietary schoolB upon very similar terms - the payment of a ten per cent, contribution.     With-a proper Fund, it would be.a simple matter to give effect to these ideas.     Without such a Fund, it becomes extraordinarily difficult, if not impracticable. Ten per cent, would be the cost of 1 future service&apos; on a funding basis,   and as regards these schools &apos;back service&apos;, if it comes in at all, comes in only to a very limited extent.     If there is to be no funding, the cost will at first be much below ten per cent.      By-and-by it will exceed it, and will presently reach as much as twenty per cent.     Their admission on a ten per cent basis will therefore mean that the non-grant-earning schools of today will be unfairly mulcted by the State, while the non-grant-earning schoolB of tomorrow will be subsidised from public funds.
m9,   What the President says in Paragraph 8 as to the cost suggests a word as to the comparative charge to the Exchequer upon a funding and upon a non-funding basis.     According to the Govern?-ment Actuary&apos;s figures, the ultimate cost of the Emmott Scheme will be  10,250,000 per annum.     If, as the Committee propose, contri-butions are obtained both from teachers and from Local Authorities and are funded, the result 7/1*3.1 be that when the Fund is stabilised the total call upon the State will be  2,500,000 per annum.     The balance of  7,750,000 will oome from the Fund,     On the other hand, if the same contributions are received but are not funded, the Exchequer will only have the sum actually received within each year ( 3,750,000) to set off again it the total outlay of  10,250,000. That is, the Exchequer will be permanently saddled with a burden not of  2,500,000 but of  6,500,000,     If contributions from Local Authorities are dispensed with, as they must be unless there is to be a genuine Fund, the extra - and in my view unnecessary - burden of  4,000,000 will rise to  5,250,000 annually.10.    I agree as to the important bearing of superannuation policy upon the pending arbitration in relation to teachers&apos; salaries. But I am disposed to think that by far the most satisfactory way of dealing with the situation would be to make, before the arbitration, an announcement on the lines which the President sketches in Para-graph 9 of his Memorandum...     It would then be the duty of the arbiter to see that the burden of contributions towards the cost of superannuation was fairly distributed and was not thrown exclusively on the teachers.     In pre-1918 days the teachers were only too glad that the Local authorities should be fellow-contributors with them-selves to the local schemes.     One cannot help suspecting that the real motive for objecting to the partnership now is the hope that, if Local Authority contributions can be dispensed with today, the time is not far distant when teachers will be able to claim a similar release.     The result of the arbitration may dispose of the trouble for a time.     But the superannuation contribution -unless it be funded - will remain a source of grievance and will form the obvious point of attack when the next period of unrest sets
11.   If there is to be   &apos; funding, the plan outlined in Para-graph 11 of the President&apos;s Memorandum would be an effective means of softening the blow, if such a softening is required.     If there is to be no funding and if the exaction of contributions is merely to be another way of reducing the grant, I cannot help thinking that the Scheme in Paragraph 9 and the palliative suggested in Paragraph 11 are alike unnecessary,     A straightforward reduction of the Grant could be effected without instituting elaborate machinery for the collection of contributions that would not be contributions in the real sense of the term at all.12.   To sum up, I am convinced that a properly constituted Fund such as the Smmott Committee recommend affords the best hope of a satisfactory solution of this most troublesome problem.&quot;J.G.&quot; .j 16.12.24.Scottish Office, Whitehall, S.W.1.t
