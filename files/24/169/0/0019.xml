[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government. ]Printed for the Cabinet.   December 1924.CONFIDENTIAL. CP. 517 (24).CABINET.IW 10320/10320/98]LEAGUE OF NATIONS.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I DESIRE to call the attention of my colleagues to an important question of principle.It is becoming a growing practice of the League of Nations to appoint committees composed of persons who are held to be solely responsible to the League and not to the Governments of the countries to which they belong. The inevitable result is that at times the members of these committees put forward or support proposals which in no way represent the views of their respective Governments. This seems wrong in theory and dangerous in practice, since it is difficult for His Majesty&apos;s Government subsequently to dissociate themselves in the eyes of the public both at home and abroad from schemes put forward or supported by the British members of committees, all the more so since these members have in most, if not in all, cases been suggested or recommended to the League for the purpose by His Majesty&apos;s Government.I think we ought in future to take steps to ensure that no British subject appointed by the League to sit on one of its committees shall be allowed by His Majesty&apos;s Government with whom rests the duty of recommending candidates  to represent any other views or support any proposals not approved by His Majesty&apos;s Government. In other words, we should insist that, if British opinion is considered by the League worthy of being consulted in regard to questions submitted to a committee, that opinion shall reflect the views of His Majesty&apos;s Government and of nobody else.&quot;When, accordingly, we are asked in future to recommend a British subject to sit on such a committee, we should, before putting forward any name, ask the gentleman selected to give an undertaking that he will act in accordance with the above principle.AC.Foreign Office, November 26, 1924.[12341]
