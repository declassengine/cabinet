Agriculture 1 Rates^(Addi,bional Grant) goat iliuanc e &quot;B i 110MEMORANDUM BY THE MINISTER OF HEALTH.The Agricultural Rates Act, 1923, which reduced the rates payable by the occupiers of agricultural land from one-half to one-quarter of the full poundage, and made provision for the payment of a Government grant in respect of the deficiency so created, is limited in duration to the period ending on the 31st0f March next,   This Act (unlike the Act of 1896) cannot be included in the Expiring Laws Continuance Bill because a fresh Money Resolution is required in order to authorise the charge upon the Consolidated Fund,   It Is accordingly necessary to proceed by a separate Bill for the purpose of continuing the Act of 1923, and the Bill, of which a cppy is appended, has been so drafted as to avoid any need for further Money Resolutions in future years. This plan will enable the Act of 1923 to be included in future Expiring Laws Continuance Bills until such time as a comprehensive measure of rating reform can be placed on the Statute book.It will be observed that provision is made in Clause 2 of the Bill for meeting a small point relating to the Scilly Islands,   poor Law relief in the Scilly Islands is administered not by a Board of Guardians, as is the case in the rest of the country, but by the overseers of the five parishes in the Isles. As however neither the overseers nor the Select Vestry, which sixpervises the overseers in the Parish of St, Mary, are a spending authority within the definition in the Schedule to the Agricultural Rates Act, 1896,  the grant payable in respect of poor Law expsndi-ture in the rest of the country is not payable in respect of suchHS-DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 S GOVERNMENT.CABINET.512(24) COPY No.HOME   AFFAIRS   COMMITTEE.

expenditure in the Soilly Islands.    Clause 2 is designed to remedy this inequality, and it is proposed that this Clause should operate as from the 30th September last, so as to allow of the payment of a grant In respect of the second half of the current financial year.     A promise that the position would be rectified was given by Lord Parmoor to Lord. On slow In the House of Lords last Session, (Parliamentary Debates, House of Lords, 27th May, 1924, Cols, 686-7).The Bill should be passed as soon as possible as rating   and precepting authorities, who in general prepare their rates in February or March, should know in advance that the Act is to be continued.     In any even* the Bi.11 must oe passed before the 31st March nest;, otherwise e.ny rate made on the basis&apos; of the continuance of the Act would be bad.(Intd.)
