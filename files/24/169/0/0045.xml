OA B I HE I,544(24). 3GTHE INSTITUTION OP POLITICAL PROSECUTIONS.Memorandum by the Home Secretary.In view of the discussions that have arisen upon the Campbell case I foar there is a danger that the Government may be committed to an attitude with regard to the institution of prosecutions involving considerations of public security or any interest of State which would be inconsistent with the statutory provisions and with the practice followed for more than forty years with entirely satisfactory results.The functions of the Home Secretary, the Attorney General and the Director of Public Prosecutions in relation to the prosecution of offences were defined in the Prosecution of Offences Act, 1879, and the Regulations made thereunder. The material provisions are as followsSection 2 of the Act&quot;It shall be the duty of the Director of Public Prosecutions&quot;under the superintendence of the Attorney General to institute&quot;undertake or carry on such criminal proceedings .............&quot;as may be for the time being prescribed by regulations under&quot;this Act or may be directed in a special case by the Attorney&quot;General.&quot;Section 8.&quot;The Attorney General with the approval of the Lord &quot;Chancellor and a Secretary of State may from time to time &quot;make and when made rescind vary and add to regulations for &quot;carrying into effect this Act.&quot;The existing Regulations dated 25th January 1886 provide (1). The cases in which it shall be the duty of the Director of Public Prosecutions to institute, undertake, or carry on a
oriminal proceeding in respect of an offence are the following:-(a). Where the offence is punishable with death; (b). Vlhere the offence is of a class the prosecution ofwhich has hitherto been undertaken by the Solicitorof the Treasury; (c). V/here an order in that behalf is given to the Directorby the Secretary of State or the Attorney General;and(d). V/here it appears to tho Director that the offence orthe circumstances of its commission is or are of such a character that a prosecution in respect thereof is required in the public interest, and that owing to the importance or difficulty of the case or to other circumstances the aotion of the Director of Public Prosecutions is necessary to secure the due prosecution of the offender. (2). The proceedings to be instituted, undertaken, or carried on in any of the above cases shall be such as the Director of Public Prosecutions considers to be necessary to secure the due prosecution of the offender.* * *&quot;.(10). The action of the Director of Public Prosecutions shall in all matters, including the selection and instruction of counsel, be subject to the directions of the Attorney General.It will be noted that by Regulation 1(c) it is the duty of the Director to institute a criminal proceeding when an order in that behalf is given to him by tho Secretary of State or the Attorney General:    but the nature of the proceeding to be instituted rests with the. Director (Regulation 2) and by Regulation 10 the action of the Director shall in all matters, including the selection and instruction of counsel, be subject to the directions of the Attorney General.For many years it has been recognized by successive Home Secretaries and Attorney Generals that as regards offences
. d 1 0involving no question of public security or State interest the  . decision whether a prosecution in a particular case should be instituted or not was one entirely for the Director and the Attorney General, but that where a prosecution might involve any consideration of public security or any interest of State it was the bounden duty of the Attorney General or the Director before deciding upon a prosecution to ascertain the views of the    ; Ministerial Department best qualified to pronounce upon the public interest involved - the Department in ordinary Apolitical&apos; cases being the Home Office.The following outstanding precedents for the above view of the constitutional position may be quoted :-(1). In 1881 Johan Most published in &quot;Die Freiheit&quot; incitements to murder certain foreign sovereigns.On 26th March.  1881, the Secretary of State, Sir William Harcourt, addressed, from 10 Downing Street, the following note to Sir Adolphus Liddell, Permanent Under Secretary of State for the Home Department&quot;Dear Liddell,The Cabinet has decided that the article in the Freheit shall be prosecuted.    I have wirtten to the Attorney General accordingly.&quot;Most was arrested on 30th March and on 31st March Sir William Harcourt stated in the House of Commons that the prosecution was instituted upon the authority of His Majesty&apos;s Government.(2). In February 1889 the Home Secretary, Mr. Henry Matthews, referred to the Law Officers, Sir Richard Webster and Sir Edward Clarke, the question of prosecuting one Taggart and another for speeches inciting to the murder of Lord Salisbury and Mr. Balfour. The Law Officers advised that prosecution should at once be taken against Taggart under section 4 of the Offences against the Person Act,  1861.    The Home Secretary however referred the matter to the Lord Chancellor, Lord Halsbury, who advised that owing to the conditional nature of the incitements, he did not think that a
enjury would convict &quot;and an effort to procure a conviction upon that Statute, and a failure, would be most injurious to the Government&quot;.Upon this the Home Secretary informed the Chief Constable of Liverpool that it was not intended to institute proceedings.(3). In 1893 the Mayor of Bristol and certain Justices sent to the Home Secretary copy of correspondence with the Director of Public Prosecutions who had refused &quot;without the express directions of the Home Secretary&quot;, to take over the conduct of certain proceedings which they had instituted against Ben Tillett and others for inciting to riot.The Director of Public Prosecutions forwarded copy of correspondence to the Secretary of State.The Secretary of State (Mr. Asquith) said&quot;in my judgment these are not cases in which &quot;the Director of Public Prosecutions should take   -&quot;action&quot;.&quot;Inform the Director accordingly.&quot;Tell the Mayor that the Secretary of State observes &quot;that the proceedings have been instituted by the local !!authority on their own responsibility, and that, &quot;without expressing any opinion upon the merits of &quot;the case, he sees no sufficient reason for instructing &quot;the Director of Public Prosecutions to intervene&quot;. (4). In December, 1919, articles by one Charles Diamond appeared in the &quot;Gatholic Herald&quot; including one entitled &quot;Killing no murder&quot;.    The Attorney General (Sir Gordon Hewart) thought the case one for prosecution for incitement to murder, &quot;subject to the consent and approval of the Secretary of State who may think it desirable to consult the Cabinet in the matter before any proceedings are instituted.&quot;The matter was referred to the Cabinet by the Home Secretary and it is recorded on Home Office papers of 6.1.20 that the Cabinet had authorised a prosecution and the Director of Public Prosecutions was so informed.
Attention should also be called to the following cases which are referred to in minutes of the War Cabinet.(l)    23rd March 1917.     At the instance of the Minister of Blookade, the War Cabinet authorised the prosecution of the Morning Post in respect of the publication of false information on the subject of the blockade provided the Law Officers advised that there had been an undoubted breach of the law and that a.-conviction was certain.(8)    17th May, 1917.     At a conference held at 10 Downing Street at which among others, the Prime Minister,  the then Attorney-General (Sir Frederick Smith) and .the Director of Public Prosecutions (sir Charles Mathews) were present, it was decided that the Attorney-General with the Director of Public Prosecutions and others should choose 8 or 10 persons against whom there was sufficient evidence te warrant proceedings for inciting to strikes in the engineering trade and instructions were given that the persons accused should be furnished with   .. full statements of the charges against them, that applications for bail should not bo opposed, that the case for the Crown -. should be presented in detail, to give the public an opinion on its merits, and that the trial should be by jury at the Old Bailey.Eight men were accordingly arrested but the prosecution was dropped upon their giving an undertaking to adhere to aa agreement arrived at on May 19th between the Ministry of Munitions and the Executive Council of the Amalgamated Society cf Engineers.This case was referred to by the late Attorney-General in the Debate on the Campbell case on the Pth October last.(.5)- 3rd Jan. 1919,     After hearing accounts of the Situation in Glasgow and receiving from the Lord Advocats legal advioe as to the &quot;possibility of arresting and making examples of some of the leaders in the strike&quot;, the War Cabinet
-f- -decided that for the moment no further action was necessary by the Government.(4)   On 7th February 1919 the War Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Home Secretary, Mr. Shortt, inquiring whether prosecutions for seditious speeches should be instituted in the present circumstances:    and especially whether one David Ramsay should be prosecuted for a speech advocating revolution by violence.     The Attorney-General, Sir Gordon Hewart, &quot;was disposed to advioe a prosecution of Ramsay subject to the approval of the policy by the Home Secretary and the Minister of Labour&quot;.     The War Cabinet approved the prosecution of Ramsay and of others who might make similar speeches and the Home Secretary informed the Director of Publio Prosecutions accordingly.This case was also referred to by the late Attorney-General in debate on 8th October when he quoted the letter of the 31st January 1919 written by the Attorney-General sir Gordon Hewart, to the Director of Public Prosecutionsi-&quot;There can be no doubt I think that this speech is seditious and that a prosecution may properly follow, tut it appears to me that the real question is one of policy and therefore is a question in the first instance for the Home Secretary and the Minister of Labour.&quot;During the war tho main public interest to be considered was the prosecution of the war and the production of munitions and accordingly many questions of policy that would ordinarily have boen referred to the Secretary of State were carried direct to the War Cabinet for decision.Many other similar cases might be quoted, and in addition there have been innumerable ^occasions upon which the Director of Public Prosecutions either teforo or after communication with the Attorney General has consulted the Home Offioo on the question of the policy of prosecuting in particular
cases, e.g.(a) Oases of a spoech at a small meeting or an article in an obscure publication where a prosecution would give the offender and his views an advertisement out of all proportion to any benefit to bo obtained by conviction and punishment.(b) Cases occurring during strikes when negotiations are nearing a successful issue and a prosecution even for a glaring breach of the law would inflame passions and render a peaceful settlement impossible - to the grave injury of the public at large.Tho gravamen of the charge against the late Government in withdrawing the prosecution of Campbell was, as I conceive that they intervened not upon any grounds of public interest but upon purely party grounds and in deference to pressure   . oxertod by a section of thoir supporters whose political views and objects can hardly be distinguished from those of the proprietors of tho &quot;Workers&apos; Weekly&quot; and tho author of the &quot;Open Letter&quot;.     The late Attorney General only suggested to the Cabinot that upon one ground or another &quot;steps could be taken not to pross tho prosecution&quot; after strong protest had boon made to Ministers by Campbell&apos;s friends and supporters in tho House of Commons.The action of the late Government also appears to have been open to strong objection in respoct of the first conclusion recorded in tho Cabinet minute of 6th August, viz: &quot;That no public prosecution   of a political character should &quot;be undertaken without the prior sanction of the Cabinet &quot;being obtained&quot;.     While, as I have shewn above, it has constantly been the practice .pf the Attorney General in dealing with cases of a political character to be guided by the views of the appropriate executive authority, that practice affords no justification for the issue of a general
direction in the terms quotod, which would have the effect orplacing the Attorney General in a position of subservience to the Executive Government in relation to all matters within the scope of the direction.     Thore is no precedent for such a direction and I am glad that it has been rescinded.     As I have pointed out, the statute and the regulations made there-under renognise the coordinate responsibility of the Home Secretary (as representing the Executive Government) and the Attorney General in these matters and in my view it would be very unfortunate if anything were done to disturb tho very dolioately adjusted relationships thus established.     The Home Office and the Department of the Director of Public Prosecutions have always kept in the closest touch in dealing with prosecu-tions of a political character and I believe that the Attorney General will concur with me in the view that those relation-ships of closo cooperation should continue undisturbed.I ahould be glad to receive tho assont of tho Cabinet to this view.W.J.H,15th December,  1924.9Z.74-P1
