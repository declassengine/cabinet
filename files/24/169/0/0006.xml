I desire to represent to the Cabinet the urgent importance of remedying the serious disadvantage at which the married Naval Officer now stands in comparison with the Married Officers of the other two Fighting Services *When the pay and allowances of Officers of the three Fighting Services were revised in 1919, the Admiralty decided to make no distinction between the emoluments of the married and the single Officer,   The War Office and Air Ministry, on   the other hand, definitely recognised marriage by the grant of a Married Allowance to Officers of 30 years of age,    As a result, Officers of the Navy are the only class in any of the three Services for which no provision for a married state is made.After prolonged examination of the question, a scheme has been propounded which, It is hoped, will prove satisfactory to the $faval Service without undue cost to the Treasury,As,&apos; however, the matter is one that ought to be considered In conjunction with the other Services, I recommend to my colleagues in the Cabinet that steps be taken to set up a Co-ordinating Pay Committee, on the same lines as in 1919, under the Chairmanship of an independent Cabinet Minister.,As the matter is of such urgency that it ought to be included in the forthcoming Navy Estimates, I hope the Committee may get to work at an early date.(Intd.)     W,   C.   B,ADMIRALTY, S.W.1,24th November, 1924,i THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.SECRET, CABINET.0 ,P.506(24) MARRIAGE   ALLOWANCE   FOR   NAVAL   CP officers. *MEMORADUM BY THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY. &apos;
P.S.Since writing the above Memorandum, I have seen an advance copy of the Chancellor of tho Exchequer&apos;s Memorandum and diagrams on this subject.     There are several statements in his Memorandum from which I profoundly dissont, and his diagrams do not, in my opinion, show the present position correctly.   Diagram A, for instance, only applies to about 18$ of Naval Officers, and it is not proposed that theso should have Marriage Allowance added to their present AllowancesiDiagrams B and C are based om age only, and do not make any allowance for relative rank and responsibility, different service conditions, the much greater liability of Naval Officers (in the higher ranks) to half-pay, or the greater extent to which Army and Air Force emoluments are exempt from Income Tax.I am quite prepared to produce counter statements and diagrams showing the serious disadvantage at which married Naval Officers are placed, but I have not done so because the whole question ia full of complicated details and involves the consideration of a large number of different conditions of service which I am. sure that the Cabinet as a whole has not time to deal with.     It is for this reason that I ask that the question may be referred to a Coordinating Committee under the Chairmanship cf a Cabinet Minister.     If tho Admiralty case does not stand this investigation it will of course be turned down, but I cannot agree with tho Chancellor of the Ex-chequer&apos;s suggestion that it should be turned down without investigation.
I have no objection whatever to tho question of reduced rates for new entries being considered simultaneously *   Thoro is, as a nuttar of fact, no difference of opinion as regards the new initial rates, and the Admiralty cvro of opinion that these might have boan put into force long ago.(Ind) . V: c, G . B,Admiralty. 6.1.1925.
