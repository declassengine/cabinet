(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRIT AH MIC MAJESTY&apos; S GOV BRNMCNT ). SECRET CP. 528(24)CABINS T.Home Affairs Committee.Importation of Pedigree Animals Bill&apos;-Memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries.The accompanying Bill is required to implement the undertaking given to the Imperial Economic Conference, 1923, to facilitate Inter-v-Imperial trade in pedigree stock throughout the Empire on reciprocal terms.      Though on the whole averse to any importation of breeding stock into this country, agricultural interests, who were consulted at the time of the Conference, agreed that subject to proper safeguards, the import of pedigree stock might be allowed.Under Section 27 of the Diseases of Animals Act, 1394, the Minister has power to make an Ordar &quot;for allowing the landing of any foreign animals intended for exhibition or for other exceptional purposes&quot;.     Since the passing of the Act of 1894 this Section has been c on3trued very strictly, and this power has been only exorcised to allow importations of pedigree stock on very few occasions.     It is proposed in the Bill to extend the limited power of tho Minister under Section 27 so as to cover the importation from the Dominions of registered pedigree stock for any purposes, although naturally breeding is the purpose for which they would generally be imported.     Animals imported under the Bill will not be subject to part I of the Third Schedule of the Act of -1894, which requires slaughter on landing, but will be subjectCopy No.
to quarantine as required by Part 2 of that Schedule. The period of quarantine will be entirely within ray discretion and It will be prescribed by the Landing Order.The intention is to make Orders allowing the landing of particular animals, and not to issue a general Order allowing e.g., the landing in Great Britain of any cattle brought from Canada which are registered in a recognised Canadian herd book.The necessity for sub-section (3) is that Section 5 of the Act of 1932 refers only to animals in an &quot;imported animals wharf&quot; or &quot;approved landing place&quot;, both of which expressions have a technical meaning and might not be held to include an &quot;imported animals quarantine station&quot;, such as would be provided for animals landed under the new Act.Sub-Section (4) Is required, as the Schedule applies generally to imported animals   with the exception only of animals landed &quot;for exhibition or other exceptional purposes&quot;.During the past few months the South African Government have been pressing very hard for Section 27 of the Act of 1894 to be strained in order to allow the import of a consignment of pedigree ?riesian cattle from South Africa, and this request has been resisted on the ground that the issue of an Order by the Ministry for such a purpose would clearly be contrary to the spirit of Section 27 and could not be justified in Parliament, especially when a Bill to authorise such importations was already in draft.     I hope, therefore, that I may be authorised to introduce the Bill&apos; at an early date, and to proceed with it as soon after the Christmas Adjournment as opportunity offers.Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, 8th December 1924.
