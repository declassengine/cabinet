Telegram from trie Officer Administering tho Government of New Zealand to the Secretary of State for the Colonies,(Dated 8th December). (Received Colonial Office 12.10 p.m, 8th December, 1924),SecreteYour telegram 4th December.     My Prime Minister asks me to convey the following reply   Begins.     I have received with great pleasure the Intimation contained In your telegram that His Majesty&apos;s Government intend to proceed with scheme for the development of the Singapore Bass.     I scarcely need to reiterate that New Zealand fully realizes the importance of Naval defence and is anxious to do its full.share in this connection, but the Dominion at present is in a somewhat difficult position in regard to this matter when coupled with the proposal that we should take over maintenance of a second Cruiser.     Parliament agreed to the latter during its Session which has recently concluded. Of course Parliament must decide whether a separate contribution towards Singapore can also be made.     Personally if we must choose as between one and the other I think it would be better to go on with the second Cruiser but I am satisfied that New Zealand realizes the importance of both proposals and In addition to the estimated annual.cost of a second cruiser which will not be less than  250,000 I am quite willing when opportunity offers to consult Parliament with regard to a straight out grant for Singapore.
Telegram from the Governor General of the Commonwealth of Australia to the secretary of State for the Colonies.Dated 8th December, (deceived Colonial Office 6,20 p.m* 8th December, 1924) n&quot;. Following from my Prime minister   Your telegram, of 5th December, my Government note with pleasure that.,the British Government has decided in principle to proceed with, the scheme for the&apos;development of the Singapore Base,   I have already expressed both in cables and at the last Imperial Conference the views of my Government with regard to urgent necessity for the Base from the standpoint not o&amp;ly of Great Britain and Australia but. of the whole Empire and we welcome decision which your Government has made, Since my telegram of 11th March to your predecessor,, however, in which I stated that Commonwealth Government recognised its obligation to contribute., to cost of Base and would submit proposals as to such contribution to its Parliament at an early date the position from the standpoint-of Australian finances has undergone.some very important changes^   Consideration of our defence expenditure in 1923 had been postponed pending results of the Imperial Conference and decision of British Government withregard to iJingapofr? J. pointed out to Parliament on the eve of my departure for Britain that what was decided in regard to Singapore would naturally govern the extent to which we would make provision for our own defence.    Despite our urgent representations and our definite offer to contribute to the cost of the Bass eontained in oable above referred to late British Government decided to abandon thVproposal and, my Government was the$e-fore forced, to a consideration of its own defence estimates., These estimates were based.upon the serious position in which Australia found herself as a result of the abandonment of the Singapore Base and were the maximiim amounts having regard to the financial circumstances of the Commonwealth which Government
felt could be provided.     A programme was laid down for the construction of   modern 10,000 ton cruisers and in addition to the annual provision for defence a special appropriation of  2,500,000 was made and a further amount of  1,000,000 was pro--vided out of a surplus for the year.1923-1924.     A generallidefence programme covering a period of 5 yeai*s was submitted to-Parliament Involving an increased, expenditure over expenditure for year 1923-1924 of  1,000,000 in each of the five yearscontemplated b.y the programme,.     These heavy commitments haveconsiderably altered the position whioh existed when in my telegram of 11th J-iarch to your predecessor the Governmentindicated that iiustralia would meie a substantial contributiontc the Singapore Base.    My Government is whole heartedly infavour of the Bo^e and will co-operate as far as possible to^contributionensure its speedy construction.     The question of contributed by Australia in view of the altered circumstances will have tobe very carefully considered and any proposals will of courserequire the endorsement of our Parliament.   It will be apprecia-.ted from the foregoing that the position is not without itsdifficulties and the extent of our co-ojs ration will naturally ?aff cctedbe effected   by the action of the other Dominions.    Australia . is already well in advance of other Dominions .in regard to naval defence and having so lately embarked on considerable expenditure to which I have referred it is not unreasonable for us to ask that the other Dominions should indicate their willingness to contribute on a reasonable basis towards Empire Defence.   My Government will be glad therefore if these facts can be conveyed to other Dominion Governments and an early intimation of -the action they ar6 prepared to take com-municatea to us.   I would reiterate the view already express-ed by me that any contribution which Australia may decide to make towards the construction of the Singapore Base should be in the form of material and not a cash p&amp;^inant.   kinds.
Following from my Prime Minister Secret and Personal.     My official telegram o  this day.     In view of circumstances outlined therein it is impossible to make any definite suggestion with regard to a contribution at this stage. For the purposes of your own announcement however I think your hand would be strengthened by a statement of the expenditure which Australia has already undertaken and an intimation that despite these heavy commitments the Commonwealth has decided to submit to its Parliament at an early date proposals with regard to further direct contri-bution to Singapore which will probably take the form of material.     As already intimated to you personally I am in favour of one contribution rather than yearly payments which would be the subject of continual debate.     whatever we do however will be very largely governed by the extent to which other Dominions co-operate   ends.Telegram from the Governor General of the Commonwealth of Australia to the Secretary of State for the Colonies.Dated 8th December, 1924.
