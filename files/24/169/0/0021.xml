CP. 519/24.Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, 2nd December, 192 4.
Copy of Letter from the National Farmers&apos; Union.Dear Mr. Wood,I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of 28th November in which you Invite the National Farmers&apos; Union to nominate six representatives to take part in a Conference jointly with representatives of agricultural landowners and farm workers on the subject of national agricultural policy.The Union has always been prepared - indeed, anxious -to  ive every assistance in its power to the Government of the day In connection with any proposals having for their object the promotion of the vsllbeing of the nation through the maintenance and development of home agricultural production and employment,    We cannot do otherwise, therefore, than regard an invitation from the Government to take part in such a Conference as being one that wo ought to accept if by so doing we can in any way serve the best interests -of the nation at large and cf our own members.We have studied very carefully the statement Issued by your Department which appeared in the Press on November 28th and of which a cop3r was enclosed with your letter.     It appears to us that there i3 one vital matter not covered by that state-ment upon which we ought to be informed before we take our decision as to whether or not we can usefully participate in the Conference.The terms of reference read:-&quot;To consider what measures, If any, are necessary either by the State or by the agricxiltural industry itself or by both in concert (1) to maintain and (2) to increase the area of arable land in England and Wales, and by what further measures the economic maximum production of food from all ihe agricultural land of the country can be stimulated/1The purpose of these measures, it is stated, would be to secure &quot;the maximum employment of labour at reasonable rates of wages, together with the full use of the land for the production of food at the lowest possible prices consistent with a fair return to all those engaged in the industry.&quot;Sines the terms of reference place in a category by itself the matter of the measures necessary to maintain and increase the area of arable land, we recall the fact that the subject was dealt with by deputations from the National Farmers1 Union which waited upon Mr. Bonar haw on 16th March, 1923, and Mr. Baldwin on 11th October, 1923.     In his reply to the state-ment made by Mr. Robbins on behalf of the Union, Mr. Bonar Law said:-&quot;What you seem to ask is that something should be done by the Government to prevent the fall in the production of foodstuffs..    It S66ms to me that that is only possible in one of two ways, either by a big subsidy, the extent of which no one Can foresee, Or by Protection.&quot;m   1   w
/* &apos;   &quot;There really is only one remedy,  and that ia Protection.&quot;W, Baldwin told the october deputation that it was obvious that there were only two remedies, subsidy and tariff.     The Union has never questioned the aocuracy of that view.So far s.3 the National Farmers&apos; Union .1s concerned, we iave not at any time asked either for subsidies or for Protection,   . ?e have consistently adhered to the view that it is the nation&apos;s business to say what is expected of home food production and the farmers business under equitable conditions to adapt his enterprise to the nation!s requirements.     Paragraph 7 of the statement issued by your Ministry declares that the Government realise   that the Conference &quot;must be supplied with as clear and precise a statement as possible of the means which must be adopted in order to attain the objects&quot; which TEey have In view, as quoted above,    Mr,- Eonar law, as I have pointed out, held that either subsidy or Protection would be necessary to prevent ajfall in the production of foodstuffs . If,, then, the Conference is to report what measures are necessary &quot;to secure an addition of not less than 1,000,000 acres to the area of arable Tanar&apos;7 it will not, I imagine, be regarded as feasible to attain that addition to the arable acreage by measures less potent than those required to prevent a ^Vnution of arable production, It seems to us, accordingly, to bVessenxial(1) that we should be informed as to whether the Government accepts the view expressed by Mr, Bonar Law and by Mr, Baldwin in 1923 and whether the contemplated modifications of state 1      policy are in the direction of subsidising the maintenance I       and increase of the arable acreage or of achieving the same end by means of tariffseWe further take the view that if a policy of subsidies bo contemplated the Conference ought to be told, In order to assess the posibility of suggesting measures to maintain and increase the eaisting area of 1arable land,r(2) what is the limit of the annual payment that would be regarded by the Government as a reasonable premium to pay for the purposeof insuring the achievement of that object in the national interest?If that information be given, there is, we believe, only one other point, upon which some assurance ought to be forthcoming. Part 1 of the Agriculture Act of 1920, enacted by a   Ooalition Govern-ment, was repealed by the same composite administration six months after the measure had reached the Statute Book, in spite of the promise embodied in the Act that four years&apos; notioe would -be given of intention to withdraw the guarantees which it provided.    We should like to know, having in mind that past experience and also the admitted need for stability of agricultural policy,(3) whether, in the event of the enactment of legislative measures involving any subsidy or tariff that the Conference may recommend, any guarantee as to their permanence can be offered to agriculturists which would be more effectual than was the solemn promise by  p-riiwni of four years * notice of change of policy given in 192q &apos;anu repudiated by the legislature six months, afterwards.! I shall be glad to have categorical replies on the threeI points which I have raised.    In the meantime I am communicating this I letter to the press in view of the publicity given to the Ministry1s 1 statement and our undertaking to make our reply available to the I public should an invitation reach this Union to participate in the ] Conference.Yours very truly,(Signed)   TH0S. HOWARD RYLAND. I President,NATIONAL FARMERS1 UNION,
1  fiI tj 0THE AGRICULTURAL CONFERENCE. Draft reply to letter from National Fanners&apos; Union.Dear Mr, Ryland,I have given careful attention to your letter of the 1st instant in reply to my invitation to the National Farmers&apos; Union to nominate representatives to the proposed Conference on Agricultural Policy.You must forgive me for saying that it appears to me that you have somewhat misconceived the intentions of the Government in calling the Conference.    You refer at some length to statements made at deputations from your Union last year, but I would remind you that those deputations took piacei in circumstances which differ considerably from those with which we are faced to-day.    At that time It was the view of the Union that the industry was in a desperate condition and that emergency measures of relief were essential. At the deputation to Mr. Bonar Law it was stated by Mr, Robbins that it was &quot;almost Impossible to exaggerate the gravity of the position&quot; and that &quot;unless means can be found to cope with It, then undoubtedly we are faced with the certainty of a great addition to the number of unemployed agricultural workers, a decline of wago rates to a figure which we hesitate to forecast and an enormous increase in the already rising numbers of agricultural bankruptciesSuch words are clearly not applicable to the present situation, and judgments formed on the facts as they existed in 1935 need not necessarily hold true to-day.        The present
problem should also be considered in the light of the suggestion In the Final Report of the Agricultural Tribunal of Investigation issued only last May that the tilled area might be maintained not only by careal cultivation, but also by a development of arable stook and dairy farming.   Whether.this is so or not, it is a new factor which calls for examination by those actually engaged In the industry.In these circumstanoes I feel that the prospects of the Conference would be seriously prejudiced by say attempt on my part to prejudge or restrict its deliberations in the manner suggested in your letter.I prefer to rely on a statement made by Mr. Robbins at the Annual Dinner of the Union on the 24th October, 1923, when he said:-&quot;If and when the Government of the day stated clearly what in their opinion was the function in the life of the State that Agriculture could most usefully discharge, and the assistance of the National Farmers1 Union was sought in framing a policy with a view to facilitating the attainment of that end, the assistance of-the organisation would not be sought in vain.&quot; His Majestyrs Government have stated in precise terms what in their opinion are the objects of any national agricultural policy, and they are surely entitled to invite from the industry a considered expression of opinion as to what action is required for their achievement.The second and third questions in your letter also appear to me to display a misapprehension of the Governments intentions.   After full consideration, the
1 K Q id 6yGovernment came to the conclusion that the right course in the first instance was to invite the industry itself to indicate the measures that would be effective to secure the attainment of the objects set out in the memorandum.      Those, engaged in the industry, and in their different way3 dependent for their livelihood upon its prosperity, are those who alone can speak with that authority which comes from intimate knowledge of the facts, and conclusions supported by the weight of their unanimous recommendation could scarcely fail to exercise great effect upon the national judgment.     Neither the Government nor the nation as a whole is in a position at this stage to express an opinion as to the limits of expenditure that the country might be willing to incur without advice from the experts of the industry as to the effectiveness of any measures recommended, and I may remind you that the reference contemplates not only action by the State but also measures that might be taken by the industry itself.If, however, definite recommendations are made by the Conference which involve State action, it will then bethe duty of the Government to take such steps as they think advisable to ascertair: the views of the various political parties and of the country as a whole, with the object of securing that.common agreement which would be the beat guarantee of permanence.     The Government have no doubt JVomthe concluding paragraphs of your letter that you are in warm agreement with them that no policy will be of enduring benefit to Agriculture which dees not carry with it, by the willing assent of all parties, as sure a guarantee as can bo given of stability.
I sincerely hope therefore that the Union will now be prepared to nominate representatives to serve upon the Conference.IYours sincerely.T.H. Ryland, Esq.
