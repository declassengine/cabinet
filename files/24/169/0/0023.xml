fThis Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government. ^ g  Printed for the Cabinet.   December 1924.^--fiQSEJDENTIAL.I.MEMORANDUM BY LORD CECIL.-fN^telegram Egypt No. 406 it is said that the Egyptian Parliament is framing a protest to the League of Nations, and in Prance No. 626 several French papers are quoted as discussing the possible bearing of the Egyptian crisis on the League. There is also a good deal in the daily papers on the subject. I venture, therefore, to make the following observations :-By article 17 of the covenant, in the &quot; event of a dispute between a member of the League and a State not member of the League .... the State not member of the League shall be invited to accept the obligations of membership in the League for the purposes of such dispute upon such conditions as the council may deem just. If such invitation is accepted, the provisions of articles 12 to 16 inclusive shall be applied with such modifications as may be deemed necessary by the council.&quot; Upon such invitation being given, the council shall immediately institute an enquiry into the circumstances of the dispute and recommend such action as may seem best and most effectual in the circumstances.&quot;It is possible to construe this article as meaning that the council should proprio motu intervene in any such dispute, but in practice it has never been so interpreted. In the dispute between Russia and Poland, or between Turkey and Greece, or between the United States and Japan, or between France and Germany the council did not intervene. It did intervene between Poland and Lithuania before the latter State was a member of the League, but that was on the application of Poland and with the assent of Lithuania. In some of the disputes between France and Germany, Germany has, I think, suggested intervention by the League, but no intervention took place in point of fact, mainly because no member of the League raised the matter in the council, and the council cannot act unless it is moved to do so by one of its members. If, however, a formal request for intervention were sent by Egypt, that is, the Egyptian Government, it would be open to any member of the council to take it up. In such a case, article 17 would, I suppose, have to be applied, though even then the council might, by making conditions, modify its application. Moreover, it is not clear whether anything beyond enquiry could take place under article 17, because it can scarcely be said that there is anything in the dispute now existing between this country and Egypt which is likely to lead to a rupture, and it is only to disputes of that nature that the provisions of article 15 applied by article 17 relate.By article 11 of the covenant it is the &quot; friendly right of each member of the League to bring to the attention of the assembly or of the council any circum-stance whatever affecting international relations which threatens to disturb international peace or the good understanding between nations upon which peace depends.&quot; Under this article any member of the League might bring the events which have occurred in Egypt to the notice of the council. That is not very likely to happen, but conceivably Persia, for instance, which has sometimes assumed the role of defending Moslem interests, might take action under this article. The council is not bound to do anything, but it might if it chose institute an enquiry into the circumstances of the Anglo-Egyptian incident.The conclusion therefore is that if any member of the League chose to take the matter up an enquiry might be held. I do not see that we have anything to fear from such an enquiry, because though it might be possible to criticise this or that minor point of our action in the main we are fully justified by the terms of the declaration of February 1922. In any case I venture to think it would be a great mistake if we were reluctant to face such an investigation. Such an attitude would be misinterpreted by our multitudinous foreign critics, and (which is much more important) might form a very awkward precedent in the case of wrong-doing Powers in the future.2524 [12342]
NOTE BY SIR C. HURST.&apos;Lord cecil&apos;8 proposal is that His Majesty&apos;s Government should offer no objection to an enquiry by the League into the dispute between Great Britain and Egypt, if any member of the League proposes at the council meeting that the League should investigate the matter.   1By the letter to-the Secretary-General dated the 19th November, written in connection with the Geneva Protocol and despatched before Sir Lee Stacks murder, His Majesty&apos;s Government adopted an attitude which is quite inconsistent with permitting any intervention by the League as between His Majesty&apos;s Govern-nient and Egypt in a matter comprised within the four subjects reserved by the British Declaration of February 1922.This particular dispute is certainly a matter within the four reserved subjects, and in view of the categorical nature of the statement made by His Majestys Government to the League so recently as the 19th November last, it does not seem to be possible for His Majesty&apos;s Government to assent to, or even acquiesce in, any enquiry by the League into this dispute. Lord Cecil was perhaps not aware of this letter when he wrote his memorandum.As regards the arguments used by Lord Cecil in his memorandum, it is clear that his mind is largely affected by the wording of article 17 of the covenant, which deals with disputes between States of which one is and one is not a member of the League, or between States of which neither is a member of the League. This is one of the most difficult of the articles of the covenant to understand or to interpret correctly, because it covers in one article matters which ought to have been divided and dealt with in two separate articles. To render the article workable it can only amount in. my judgment in the case of a dispute between a member and a non-member of the League to an extension to that particular case of the system laid down in articles 15 and 16. In the case of a dispute, therefore, between Great Britain and Egypt I think this article would only apply where the case had been submitted to the council by one of the parties to the dispute. As between a State which is a member and a State which is not a member of the League, I do not think that article 17 can have a wider operation than article 15 where the dispute is between two members, and under article 15 the council does not intervene proprio motu; the dispute must be submitted to it. If so, the words &quot;shall be invited &quot; in article 17 only apply if and when the dispute has been submitted to the council by a party, whether that party is the member or the non-member of the League, and are intended to ensure that if the non-member takes the benefit of the League machinery it must also accept all the obligations and responsibilities so far as that dispute is concerned.The correct interpretation of article 17 in the case of a dispute between two States neither of which is a member of the League is more difficult, but, as one party to the dispute with Egypt (if it is a &quot;dispute&quot; within the meaning of article 15) is a member of the League, need not be considered on this occasion.Lord Cecil also refers to article 11. We thrashed out at some length at Geneva the question of the relations between article 11 of the covenant, i.e., the right of the council to take any action that may be necessary to safeguard the peace of nations, and article 15. The subject became an important one in connection with the Japanese trouble, as it became necessary to consider what action the council could take, under a proper interpretation of the covenant, in a dispute arising out of a matter which by international law is exclusively within the jurisdiction of a particular State.For His Majesty&apos;s Government, who are permanently represented on the council, the difference between what can be done under article 11 and what can be done under article 15 (including 17) is exceedingly important. No action can be taken by the council under.article 11 without the concurrence of the parties to the dispute, whereas in a matter that can be dealt with under article 15 ^including 17) a unanimous decision of the council, excluding the parties to the. dispute, is binding on them to this extent that they neither of them can go to war in contravention of the counciFs recommendations. This view was debated at length and accepted by all the members of the British Empire delegation, by the sub-committee of the First Committee of the assembly, which deals with legal and constitutional questions, by the First Committee itself at a plenary  session,  and by the wish of that committee was embodied in
3   f:the Politis Report on the text of the Geneva Protocol. Sofar as concerns action by the council under article 11 of the covenant, therefore, nothing can be done by. the council in connection with this dispute between Great Britain and Egypt except with the concurrence of His Majesty&apos;s Government. It is true that, speaking strictly, this would not prevent the Council of the League at one of its meetings discussing the subject, nor would it prevent the council by a majority vote, as a matter of procedure, appointing a committee to consider the question (see article 5), but it would prevent any decision being come to or action taken in the dispute which would prejudice the position of His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment, and, in view of the definite attitude adopted by His Majesty&apos;s Government in their letter of the I9th November, it renders it most unlikely that the council would attempt to deal with the question at all under article 11 if His Majesty&apos;s Government objected.The result is that, in my view, neither article 11 nor article 17 give the Council of the League any right to intervene in this dispute in a manner which would embarrass His Majesty&apos;s Government, unless the dispute is formally submitted to the council by one of the parties.I am dealing in a separate paper with the question of the reasons upon which the Secretary of State might rely in urging the council that the League has no locus standi in this dispute at all.C J B HNovember 29, 1924.[E 9996/9316/16] Annex.Mr. Osborne to Sir E. Drummond (Geneva).Sir, Foreign Office, November 19, 1924.The attention of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government has been called to the resolution adopted by the Assembly of the League of Nations on the 2nd October, 1924, for opening the protocol on the pacific settlement of international disputes for signature by those representatives of members of the League who were already in a position to sign it and to hold it open for signature by all other States.2. As the terms of this resolution might suggest the communication of the protocol to the Government of Egypt, I am directed by His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to remind you that the British protectorate over Egypt came to an end in virtue of the declaration made by the Government of His Britannic Majesty on the 28th February, 1922, and approved by Parliament on the 14th March of that year. Under the terms of that instrument certain questions were absolutely reserved to the discretion of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government until such time as an agreement might be come to regarding them with the Egyptian Government.3. The Governments of other countries were informed by His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government of the termination of the British protectorate over Egypt in a notification which contained the following passage : &quot; The welfare and integrity of Egypt are necessary to the peace and safety of the British Empire, -hich will therefore always maintain as an essential British interest the special relations between itself and Egypt long recognised by other countries. These special relations are defined in the declaration recognising Egypt as an independent sovereign State. His Majesty&apos;s Go?ernment have laid them down as matters in which the rights and interests of the British Empire are vitally involved and will not admit them to be questioned or discussed by any other Power. In pursuance of this principle they will regard as an unfriendly act any attempt at interference in the affairs of Egypt by another Power, and they, will consider any aggression against the territory of Egypt as an act to be repelled with all the means at their command.&quot;4. In these circumstances His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government are unable to admit that the protocol, if signed by Egypt, will enable the Egyptian Government to invoke the intervention of the League of Nations in the settlement of the matters absolutely reserved by the declaration to the discretion of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.I am, &amp;c.D. G. OSBORNE.
