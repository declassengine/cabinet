(Circulated by direction of the Prime Minister).The following notes have been prepared in connection with the proposal made by the Minister of Health in G.P.495(24) that a period of two consecutive hours between 10-30 a.n. and 6,30 p.m,, , which should not clash with Question-time in the House of Commons, should be reserved on the same day every week for Ministerial appointments, and that no Cabinet Committees should be arranged to clash with that time..The fixed appointments for the Cabinet and its Committees are as follows :-Wednesday morninp, 11,30 a0ra.    -   Cabinet.Thursday afternoon -   Unemployment Committee.(Also an Admiralty Board Meeting).Friday morning -   Committee of Home Affairs.The exact times of the two latter Committees are liable to alteration according to whether Parliament is sitting or not. At present the Committees meet at 2 pan., and 11 a.in. respectively.In addition it is desirable to reserve Tuesday and&apos; Thursday morning for ad hoc Cabinet Committees and for meetings of the Committee of Imperial Defence ana its Sub-Commit tees.Monday mornings have always been rather a favourite7
day for emergency meetings of the Cabinet in order to deal with questions of urgency that have arisen late in the previous week or during the week-end, or which are to he raised during the week in Parliament.Having regard to all the above considorations it is suggested that the Cabinet might reserve Monday afternoons and Friday afternoons as a &quot;Close-time&quot; so far as meetings of the Cabinet and its Committees are concerned,     It should, cf course, be iinderstood, however, that the Cabinet itself may have to meet as a matter of urgency on any day.(Sgd, )     M.P.A.
