[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty^ Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.   December 1924.SECRET.CP. 507 (24). Copy4ft).   39CABINET.ARTILLERY FOR INDIAN STATES.Note by the Chairman of the Committee of Imperial Defence.I CIRCULATE, for the consideration of my colleagues, a recommendation of the Committee of Imperial Defence made during the term of office of the late Government on the subject of artillery for Indian Native States, together with the Memorandum (OLD. Paper No. 136-D) referred to therein, and a summary of previous decisions on the subject.CURZON.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1, December 2, 1924.I.Extract from the Minutes of the 189th Meeting of the Committee of Imperial Defence, held on November 4, 1924.^fc -34- ^(2.)--Artillery for Indian States.The Committee had under consideration a Memorandum by the Secretary of State for India on Artillery for Indian States (OLD. Paper No.&apos; 136-D).LORD RAWLINSON explained that the grant of modern artillery to native States had been recommended before, but had been refused by the Cabinet. Since that date several Indian Chiefs had asked that this question might be reopened as they considered that the present rule whereby they were only allowed old muzzle loaders was an aspersion on their loyalty. He thought there was no objection to native States being granted 15-pounders. These guns were obsolete so far as the regular army was concerned and would satisfy the amour-propre of Indian Chiefs. The State of Kashmir was already allowed to have 2-75-in. mountain guns and that saved the expense of keeping up equivalent regular Indian Batteries in their place. Fifteen-pounders in other States would be useful for internal security purposes. Ammunition for these 15-pounders could not be made locally in the Indian States and all the supply would be held in Government hands.LORD CAVAN supported the issue of 15-pounders to Indian Native States provided the Government of India controlled and were responsible for the ammunition supply.; LORD CHELMSFORD considered that the Native States should be trusted entirely or not at all and in this case he thought that 15-pounders should be issued to them. He drew the attention of the Committee to the fact that when the previous recommendation for modern artillery had been considered it had been refused not because there was a doubt of the loyalty of the Chiefs themselves, but because it was thought that their troops might at some time get out of hand and thus become a danger.[12375] b
Conclusion.The Committee agreed to recommend to the Cabinet That 15-pounder guns should be issued to selected Indian States, subject to the following provisos which are set forth more fully in C.I.D. Paper No. 136-D :-(a.) Only selected States should be supplied with 15-pounder guns and the proportion of artillery to other arms in those States should not be higher than in the British Army, and the control of the supply of ammunition should rest with the Government of India.(b.) The implication should be avoided that the pattern of artillery which has last been rejected by the Regular forces should successively be conceded to selected States.(c.) The Government of India should be informed of the reasons which have induced His Majesty&apos;s Government to sanction the issue of 15-pounder guns to Indian States, and that the arguments put forward by the Government of India which might suggest the grant of Field Artillery of the latest pattern are not endorsed.* * * * * *% Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1, November A, 1924.(C.I.D. Paper No. 136-D.)II.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Indfa.1. In 1921 the Government of India, in connection with a general reorganisation of the forces of Indian States, proposed that certain States should be allowed to have on loan artillery of a modern pattern, subject to the conditions that, (i) the artillery units should be maintained as a complement to other arms forming a fighting force to be maintained in a high state of efficiency, (ii) the proportion of artillery to other arms should not be higher than in the British Army, (iii) the control of the supply of ammunition should rest with the Government of India.2. The question was very fully considered early in 1923 by the then Cabinet, who decided to reject the proposals, holding that on broad grounds of Imperial policy the reasons in. favour of the proposal were outweighed by the disadvantages. The decisive consideration was the belief that the grant of modern artillery to the Ruling-Chiefs would inevitably be followed by a demand for the same artillery in the Indian Army which it would be difficult to resist.The supply of pack batteries armed with 2 &quot;75 inch guns was, however, approved, -since these were already possessed by the Indian Army. Up to the present only one pack battery of 2&apos;75 inch guns has been unconditionally accepted,8 though there is a . possibility of two other batteries being maintained.3. The Government of India, in a despatch which is printed in the annexnre, have reopened the question, and have asked that they should be permitted to give to selected States 15-pounder guns, which are now obsolete so far as regular forces are concerned.4. In para. 6 of their despatch the Government of India express the view that the possession of these obsolete weapons by cerlain States would not strengthen the contention that the field artillery of the Regular Army in India should be Indianised. For if any possibility arose hereafter of adding field artillery units to the Indian Army, there would be no question in any event of providing the Indian Army with these obsolete guns. The main difficulty felt by the Cabinet in 1923 is therefore met, and I feel that I cannot withhold my support from the Government of India&apos;s present proposals.* Not yet organised.
Annexuue.Despatch No. 8 from Government of India (Foreign and Political Department) to Secretary of State for India, dated 3rd July 1924.My Loud,We have the honour to address you in regard to the correspondence ending with your predecessors telegram No. 2861, dated the 2nd August 1923, in which sanction was accorded to the maintenance in Indian States of pack batteries armed with 2&apos;75-inch guns, while permission for the maintenance of wheeled artillery was refused on the ground that such weapons are not possessed by the Indian Army.2. On receipt of these orders we issued On the 5th October last a letter (of which a copy is enclosed4) explaining the conditions on which the Government of India were prepared to allow selected States to maintain pack batteries as a part of their reorganised State forces. Though this letter was issued more than eight months ago applications have up to the present been received from two States only, Gwalior and Bikaner. His Highness the Maharaja of Bikaner has offered to maintain a pack battery to be carried on camels, a scheme which is likely to involve difficulties of a practical nature, while His Highness the Maharaja of Gwalior is prepared to accept one battery at once and another at a later date subject to certain conditions.3. His Highness the Maharaja of Bikaner has expressed regret at the decision not to permit the maintenance of batteries of garrison artillery and earnestly hopes that it may be possible for the Government of India under the recent policy of greater trust and confidence in the Indian States to take up the question of supplying such artillery and other types of guns at a future date. His Highness the Maharaja of Gwalior is deeply mortified at the decision, which he regards as an insult to his loyaltjr, and he has only accepted the ,pack batteries on. condition that his present muzzle-loading guns are replaced by muzzle-loading - bronze guns with rifling and accurate sighting. We forward a copy of a letter* received from the Gwalior Darbar on the subject, together with a covering letter from the Resident at Gwalior. We have reason to believe that at least one other Ruler entertains the same sentiments as the Maharaja of Gwalior, though they have not been officially expressed. The hesitation of other States to come forward with offers of pack batteries is presumably due to reluctance to incur increased expense on their State troops,4. We are deeply concerned at the attitude taken up by His Highness the Maharaja Scindia in the matter. Endeavours to induce His Highness to accept the position have been unsuccessful. His Highness&apos;s view is that he did all that was in his power for the Empire during the war and thus added fresh proofs of his already fully proved loyalty, and that the Government of India, with the concurrence of* Not reprinted.[12375] &apos; b 25. T have consulted my advisers and they see no great objection to accepting the proposals, subject to the following stipulations, with which I am in agreement :-(a) Great importance is to be attached to the condition that only selected States-are to be supplied with 15-pounders, and to- provisos (ii) and (in) mentioned in para. 1 above.(b) The implication is to be avoided that the pattern of artillery which is the lastto: have been rejected by the Regular Forces should successively be conceded,. - as a matter of course, to selected States.(c) It should be made clear to the Government- of India that the arguments in paras. 2 to 5 of their despatch of 3rd July would not by themselves be regarded as justifying the reopening of the- question recently decided by His Majesty&apos;s Government, and that the contentions used throughout the despatch, and more particularly in paras. 7 to 11, which would justify the grant of artillery of the latest pattern, and not merely of obsolete guns, are not endorsed.6. I hope that the Committee of Imperial Defence will concur in the proposals as. th as limited. I suggest that they should consider them at their meeting on 4th November in order to take advantage of the presence of Lord Rawlinson.OLIVIER.29th October 1924.
the Imperial Government, announced, a policy of trust, but that when this policy was put to the test the Government of India gave way to distrust. In this view His Highness persists, and in order to show his dissatisfaction he has refused an additional battalion of infantry for the purpose of maintaining in times of emergency the security of the strategic railway passing through his State. His Highness&apos;s refusal will necessitate the security of that portion of the railway being provided for by Regular troops. This would be undesirable in principle and wasteful of our better fighting material.5. It seems to us unadyisable to. keep a Prince of the power and influence of His Highness the Maharaja of Gwalior in the discontented mood into which the refusal of the guns recommended, by the Government of India has thrown him. Ic is true that the Maharaja has agreed to maintain pack batteries on condition that his wheeled artillery is replaced by rifled muzzle-loading bronze guns, weapons of a similar type to those given to the States of Patiala, Nabha, Jind, Kapurthala, Bahawalpur and Faridkot in 1890. There are, however, now great practical difficulties in meeting the wishes of the Maharaja in regard to the provision of rifled muzzle-loading guns. No guns of this type are available, since all bronze and other obsolete guns were disposed of in 1921. The erection of special plant would be necessary for the manufacture of guus and ammunition of this type and considerable expense would be involved. In any case we are not disposed to advocate rearmament with thoroughly obsolete weapons.6. We have therefore decided, after a careful examination of all aspects of the case, to urge reconsideration of the decision conveyed in your predecessors telegram referred to in paragraph 1 above. The only reasons which we can find on official record against the maintenance of modern wheeled artillery by Indian States are (1) That artillery is an arm requiring such scientific training that the Indian States could not be expected to maintain it in a condition of efficiency for modern warfare (paragraph 11 of Government of India despatch No. 41, dated the 13th March 1889); and   -(2) That modern artillery is not possessed by the Indian Army (your predecessors telegram No. 2861, dated the 2nd August 1923).As a statement of fact (1) is no doubt correct. As an argument against the possession of artillery by the States, it can never have had more than a limited validity, and such validity as it had has been reduced to a minimum since modern pack artillery, which requires the same standard of efficient handling as any other form of light artillery, has been sanctioned for the States.The second reason loses force when it is realised, as appears later in this despatch, that we propose that the guns to be given to the States should be 15-pounders. It is not anticipated that the possession of these particular weapons by the Indian States will in any way strengthen the contention that Field Artillery in the Regular Array in India should be Indianised. These guns are not modern Field Artillery they are not even quick-firers and they do not compare favourably with our modern &apos; quick-firing pack artiLery, the possession of which by Indian States has already been sanctioned. The 15-pounder is an obsolete weapon as far as the Regular Army is concerned, and the possession of an obsolete gun by Indian States can offer no valid argument for its re-introduction into the Indian Army on an Indianised basis.7. And here we would observe that even when the question of the supply of modern artillery to Indian States was discussed in the eighties of the last century-such authorities as the late Lord Roberts, General Sir George Chesney, then Military Member, and Sir James Lyall, Lieutenant-Governor of the Punjab, were in favour of the proposal. Sir George Chesney remarked that in this matter we should &quot; trust the States not at all, or all in all,&quot; and although we recognise that there are at present certain practical limitations on what is comprehensively described as the policy of trust, we feel that the opinions of these distinguished officers, held in spite of remembrances of the Mutiny, are entitled to the f idlest respect.8. We understand that in addition to the reasons against the grant of artillery to the States alluded to in paragraph 6 above the further consideration has been adduced against the proposal that although there is every reason to have profound faith in the loyalty of most of the Indian Rulers, it would not be altogether safe to trust their troops at the present time.
III.Summary of previous Decisions.(Prepared by the Secretary of the Cabinet.)The following is a short summary of the question of the grant of Artillery to Indian States: In December 1922, when the Report of the Indian Military Requirements Committee was before the Cabinet (CP. 4310), the Secretary of State for India circulated a Note covering a despatch from the Government of India on theIt is, we recognise, difficult to carry the widely announced policy of complete trust in the States to its logical conclusion in this matter. Here we desire to place on record our profound conviction that the Rulers as a body are without exception wholeheartedly loyal to the person of His Majesty and to the British Empire. We do not deny that there have been a few, a very few, isolated incidents iu the past which have caused doubts as to the attitude of individual Princes. But the times are rapidly changing. The Rulers are being knit more and more, by ties both of affection and of self interest, to the British Government in India. We find it impossible to envisage any conditions in which any Ruler could be so foolish, or so forgetful of his true interests, as to range himself in active hostility against the Paramount Power. We therefore eliminate at once from our calculations the doubt that any Ruler could in the conditions of the present time abuse the trust we place on his loyalty to the extent of using the guns we desire to give him against ourselves. Our experiences in the Mutiny and in the great war fortify us in this conviction.11. There remains the only really important argument against the gift of wheeled artillery to the States. Could the Rulers in a time of turmoil and civil commotion control their forces and prevent their troops from turning their guns against the forces of the Crown &apos;? This is a matter of opinion. For our part we are prepared to accept the risk, though we maintain that the probability is so remote that it is hardly worthy of consideration. A similar risk has not prevented us from arming the State troops with rifles and machine guns of exactly the same pattern as those in use in our Regular Army. The forces of Indian States (except in the case of Kolhapur and Travancore) are now officered and commanded by Sardars and Nobles of the States owning land and enjoying concessions at the hands of the Rulers. The troops are now almost entirely recruited within the States themselves and are taken from classes which are the least liable to undesirable influences. These circumstances all tend to keep the troops faithful to their Darbavs and the Princes thoroughly realise the advantage and necessity of keeping them contented and loyal.12. On these grounds we urge reconsideration of tins question, if His Majesty&apos;s Government accept our recommendations in this matter we would ask that we should be permitted to give to selected States the i5-pounder gun which is not used now by the Royal Artillery. The 15-pounder is, as pointed out above, obsolete or at least obsolescent, and there can, in our opinion, be no potential harm in giving it to such Indian States as we may consider deserving. It would be a very useful weapon to them for their internal, security either as wheeled or garrison artillery, and would be impressive for parade occasions. By giving the States these guns we shall satisfy their aspirations and at the same time not endanger our security in any way, There are many of these weapons in the forts and arsenals in India. His Excellency. the Commander-m-Obief thinks that there would be no difficulty about the supply of ammunition. As a safeguard, if safeguard is needed, we propose to retain in our hands the supply of ammunition and only sufficient practice ammunition would be issued to the States to enable them to make their batteries efficient for purposes of war. We anticipate that the requests for batteries will be few. The States have not shown any great eagerness to possess artillery, being deterred probably by the expense of maintenance, and financial considerations will doubtless prevent any but the largest and most efficient States from maintaining wheeled or other artillery.We have, &amp;c,(Signed) READING. &amp;c,        &amp;c, &amp;c.
question of granting Artillery to Indian States (CP. 4350). In this Paper he suggested that the Cabinet should discuss the question together with the Report of the Indian - Military Requirements Committee. Subsequently the Prime Minister discussed the whole question of Indian military requirements with the Secretary of State for India, and it was decided that the question of Artillery for Indian States should not be discussed by the Cabinet at that time.At the end of January 1923 a small Committee was appointed to consider the question of the Indianisation of the Indian Army which had arisen in connection with the Report of the Indian Military Requirements Committee (CP. 13 (23)). This Committee met on the 25th January (Ref: India/B/1), and, in addition to discussing the question of the Indianisation of the Indian Army, also discussed the question of Artillery for the Native States. During the discussion on the latter point it was pointed out that the Government of India had supported the proposal to issue Artillery to Indian Chiefs provided the supply of ammunition was sufficiently guarded. It was considered that there was much to be said for strengthening the Forces of the native Chiefs, who were a mainstay of British rule in India, but if. modern guns were issued to them there would undoubtedly be a demand for the formation of Indian Artillery Batteries in the Regular Indian Army.The Committee agreed &quot;that the native Chiefs should not be allowed to raise batteries armed with modern artillery.&quot;The Conclusion of this Committee came before the Cabinet in March 1923 (Cabinet 14 (23), Conclusion 3), when it was considered that, on broad grounds of Imperial policy, the reasons in favour of the proposal were outweighed by the disadvantages. In particular, the Cabinet were influenced by the consideration that the grant of this privilege to the native Princes would be followed by a scheme for the equipment of the Indian Army (consisting of Indian troops) with similar artillery a claim which it would be difficult to resist.The Cabinet accordingly agreed &quot; to confirm the conclusion of the Cabinet Committee that the native Chiefs should not be allowed to raise batteries armed with modern artillery.&quot;At a later date, in June 1923, the Secretary of State for India recommended that certain principal native States should be given permission to maintain under proper safeguards a limited number of machine-gun sections transported in Ford cars and pack batteries of 2&apos;75-inch mountain guns, with which the Indian Army and the State of Kashmir were already equipped. This question was discussed between the Secretary of State for India, the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and the Financial Secretary to the Treasury.The Cabinet agreed (Cabinet 32 (23), Conclusion 3) &quot; to approve the proposals of the Secretary of State for India that certain of the principal native States in India should be given permission to maintain under proper safeguards a limited number of (1) machine-gun sections transported in Ford cars; and (2) pack batteries of 2&apos;75-inch mountain guns.M.
