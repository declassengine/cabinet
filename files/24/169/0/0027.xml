This document is the property of His Britannic Majeet/s Government.     174SECRET.Copy No. q aCP. 526 (34).THE CABINET.FUTURE  STATUS OF THE  EGYPTIAN  ARMY.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR.The future status of the Egyptian Army with particular reference to the question of 0143 the employment of Kritish officers and non-commissioned officers therewith is a subject 2139 that demands early consideration.So far as the Sudanese portion of this Army is concerned, the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government has already been declared, viz., that the Army of the Sudan should be purged of the Egyptian element, and should be constituted as a Defence Force entirely under the control of the Governor-General of the Sudan, with officers holding commissions signed by the Governor-General.As regards the Egyptian Army proper, the position is more complicated. Up to the present, the Sirdar of the Egyptian Army has been appointed by the Khedive, with the concurrence of the British Government. Units of the Egyptian Army are partially officered down to the rank of Bimbashi (major) by seconded British officers who volunteered for such service, their commissions in the Egyptian Army being signed by the King of Egypt.   British non-commissioned officers are also attached as instructors.The future presents three possible courses : (a) Some form of protectorate over Egypt.(b) An arrangement under which, by treaty or otherwise, both the British and theEgyptian Governments would jointly undertake the defence of the Canal and Egypt against foreign aggression.(c) A purely Egyptian Army under the control of an Egyptian Commander-in-Chief.Under (a) and (b) the existing practice of sending officers to the Egyptian Army could continue, provided always that the control of that Army remains with His Majesty&apos;s Government. If, however, the adoption of either of the first two alternatives be regarded as outside the field of practical politics in the immediate future, it is necessary to consider in some detail the implications of the third.Lord Allenby, whose views have been obtained, while maintaining the opinion that the commands of the Sudan and Egyptian Armies should be separated, the former under a British, the latter under an Egyptian, Commander-in-Chief, is averse from making this change immediately and concurrently with the withdrawal of the Egyptian Army from the Sudan, on the ground that the obvious inference would be that the Egyptians secured the high command of their own army by killing their British Commander-in-Chief.If it be decided to hand over the complete control of the Egyptian Army to the Egyptian Government, it should be done subject to safeguards on two points : (a) The entrance of foreign officers into the Egyptian Army.(b) The creation of an army so powerful and efficient as to embarrass the british position in Egypt.(a) Should be definitely prohibited. If the Egyptian Army require foreign instructors or advisers they must be borrowed from the British Government.As regards (b) it is thought that financial considerations, combined with the notoriously indifferent military qualities of the Egyptian, should prove a sufficient safeguard ; but it is for consideration whether powers should not be taken in the26/Ptg/364  100  12/24   W.O.P.  1619
arrangements to be made with the Egyptian Government to regulate and control the size and/or armament of the Egyptian Army.Finally the constitution of an independent Egyptian Army commanded by an Egyptian Commander-in-Ohief must entail the removal of all British officers from that Army, since it is axiomatic that no British officer holding His Majesty&apos;s commission can serve under an Egyptian officer, except conceivably in a purely advisory capacity. As officers at present serving with the Egyptian Army were seconded to that Army on a contract for a definite term of years, their financial position would have to be adequately safeguarded.I am of opinion that Lord Allen by should be told that, as it is not yet possible to predict the course of negotiations with the Egyptian Government, no steps should yet be taken to give up our present rights with regard to the constitution of the Egyptian Army, i.e., that the status quo should be maintained for the present.L. W.-E.5th December, 1924.
