S DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.CABINET.TRADE   BOARDS   AOTS.SECRET..0. P*523 (34).Principles of Administration.MEMORANDUM BY THE MINISTER OF LABOUR.1.     It is probable that some publio announcement of the Government^ polloy in relation to the Trade Boards Acts will before long become inevitable, and it is also neceseary for the performance of ourrent administrative work under the act that the Governments pelioy in its main lines should be settled.   The attitude to be adopted towards Trade Boards must, of course, be determined as part of the Government&apos;s labour polloy.     I have kept this in mind in the following proposals, which are, I think, consistent with&apos; the general policy we have in. mind. 3.    As my colleagues are aware, the first Trade Boards Aot was passed in 1909 to deal with the admitted evils of &quot;sweating&quot;.      The amending Act of 1918 broadened the basis of the original Aot.     The raison d&apos;esre of Trade Boards was now stated to be not only the prevention of sweating but also the supply of some machinery controlled by representatives of employers and workpeople for the regulation of wages in trades in which suoh machinery did not exist.   The Aot of 1918 jfaleo made some changes in maohinery. but these were not of firBt olass importanoe. 3.    The Act of 191B was determined very largely by the Report of the committee on the    Relations of Employers and Employed (The Whitley Oommittee), and gave substance to the ideas upon the regulation of industry whiioh were accepted almost universally at that time.    With the
decline of trade in 1921 and the years following, these ideashave been less strongly held w^h^l^s^^TCphffis-i^, and inthe administration of the Trade Boards Acts the tendenoy &quot;hasbeen to revert to the basis of 1909, namely, the use ofthe Aots solely for the prevention of^&quot;sweating&quot;.    *The committee of Enquiry into the Administration of the Aots,over whioh the Lord Chancellor presided, reoommended (in 1922)a reversion to this basis.4.     The last Conservative Government adopted the &quot;anti-sweating&quot; prinoiple, and decided to introduce a Bill on the lines of the Report of the Oommittee presided over by Lord Gave, The Bill was, in faot, introduced, but no progress was made with it as it aroused opposition from many different quarters.   1 am very reluotant to advise the re-introduction of a controversial measure of thiB kind, nor do I feel that it is necessary to do so.     I am satisfied that it is possible, within the limits of the existing statutes, to oarry on the administration of the Trade Boards Acts generally in the spirit of the Report of Lord 0ave!s Oommittee, and that amending legislation is not required in the immediate future.5.     All parties are agreed that sweating should be prevented. Certainly auoh a polioy is in oomplete aooord with the whole history of Conservative legislation, and wherever, therefore, there is prima facie reason to believe that sweating exists the faots should be ascertained, and action taken to stop suoh sweating if it be found to be actually prevalent.     It is not, however, in aooord with what I oonoeive to be either our principles or our tradition to endeavour to regulate by*    As an appendix to this Memorandum is attached a list of trades to whioh the Trade Boards Acts have been applied,   it will be seen that they belong   mainly to the catergory of smaller trades and that   many of them are trades employing an exceptionally heavy proportion of women workers.
governmental aotion wages at levels far above the sweating line.    If this be true of governmental aotion generally, much more is it true of compulsory methods involving the application of the criminal law.    I think, therefore, that the Government will be well advised to adhere to the principles of the Trade Boards Act of 1909, and within the limits of these principles to adhere to the polloy accepted by the last Conservative Administration and announced in the House of Commons, namely, to apply the Trade Boards Acts where - and only where - the wages conditions are shown (after investigation) to require regulation If &quot;sweating&quot; 13 to be avoided. 6.    I should, therefore, be glad to have authority to make announcements as and when occasion arises on the following lines(1) The Government adheres to the principle that&quot;sweating&quot; must be prevented. (2) The Government does not propose to introduce legislation, but efforts will be made to apply, in the course of administration, the spirit of the Cave Committee1s recommendations. (3) The Acts will be applied to new trades only where, after careful investigation, it is ascertained that wages are unduly low, i.e. that what may be regarded aB &quot;sweating&quot; conditions obtain.(4) In other cases the Government will endeavour to forward the prevention . and settlement of disputes by means of the Whitldy Councils and other forms of conciliation and arbitration.
Ministry of Labour, 4th Deoember, 1924.(5)    Before finally applying the Aotsto new tradesthere will, in any oase in whioh any doubt exists, be a pnblio enquiry to examine the facts and to hear objeotione.7,    certain outstanding questions of difficulty in oonneotionwith the operation of the Aotsin distributive trades exist.These I should propose to deal with on the lines set out above.(intld.)
