Secret Refer to your secret telegram of 23rd November my Ministers have not assented or concurred in the ultimatum nor have they been consulted with regard to its terms.

Desire to acknowledge with thanks your various cables re Egypt.My Government very deeply deplores incident which led -   up to the present acute situation and notes measures taken in connection therewith.As the views of the Commonwealth Government with regard to the vital importance of maintaining control of the Suez Canal in the interests of the Empire generally and Australia particularly have already been fully set forth at the last Imperial&apos;. Conference and in subsequent communications further comment at this stage is unnecessary. We feel confident that nothing will be done which does not &apos; harmonise with those views and that we shall be fullyconsulted should any drastic action be contemplated.

Secret,Please give your Prime Minister I.F.S) President of Executive Councilfollowing personal message begins&apos;:Egypto     We are endeavouring to keep you informed as fully and rapidly as possible of situation which inevitablydevelops almost from hour to hour.     We should be glad, to knowif information sent (which has been designed as far as possibleto supplement- Press Messages) is from your point of Viewsufficient or if there are any respects in which vou&apos; would wishit amplified.     As regards general purpose underlying all our action policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government is:(1) In the Soudan to put an end to Egyptian anti-British propaganda denounced by late Prime Minister in his published despatch of October 7th to Lord Allenby and. to secure full authority In that country where our responsibilities are direct. Here our policy follows lines foreshadowed by Ramsay Maodonald.(2) in Egypt to do no more than is necessary to secure - fulfilment by Egyptian Government of its Obligations and our power to fulfil our own and to protect canal.(3) In each case to base ourselves on declaration cf Feb-r-ary 28th 1922.     Ends.Despatch of October 7th published in Cmd,2269 and declaration of February 28th 1922 published in Cmd. 1592..AMERY;
Telegram from the Governor General of the Commonwealth of Australia to the Secretary of State for the Colonies (Received 1st December, 1924)Secret.Following from my Prime Minister begins.     Your personal message of 29th November I appreciate your endeavour to keep me informed as fully as possible with regard to the situation in Egypt and the Sudan.     Can understand also that circumstances are changing and developing continuously making it extremely difficult for you to give full effect to the principle of consultation agreed between Britain and the Dominions without grave risk of stultifying action which to be effective must very frequently be prompt.     With a proper regard however for the responsibilities and difficulties of your position I feel that some greater effort can and should be made to keep us more promptly advised.     In almost every instance since the Egyptian crisis arose official cables have arrived long after press messages.     On last Saturday full account of mutiny of Sudanese Regiment appeared in local papers but up to the present we have received no official information.     In ordinary circum-stances this might not be of vital importance but should the situation suddenly take a critical turn it would be most embarrassing indeed for my Government and might seriously affect public temper if it became known that as in the case of Chanak incident information was known to the world before being officially conveyed to us.     While it is true that the graver the issue the more difficult is your position in this regard it
must not &quot;be forgotten that it is only in these circumstances that the public excitement is aroused and the right of the Dominions to the fullest consultation most rigorously insisted on.     There would appear to.be no reason why telegraph-line should not be entirely cleared for prior transmission of such important messages and the knowledge that your Government and the Dominion Governments were working as far as possible in concert would do much to improve the spirit in which any obligations subsequently imposed on us by circum-stances were carried out.     With regard to the general purpose underlying actions of your Government it is very gratifying to learn that the British Government is adhering to the policy laid down in the Declaration of 28th February 19 22 and despatch of 7th October 1924. Views of my Government have been clearly expressed in telegrams of 17th June 1Q24 and 6th October 1924 and we take your present telegram as a full endorsement of our views and&apos;as a fre&amp;h assurance that there will be no departure from them.     Ends.G0V3RI0R GENERAL.
Secret.     1st December.Following from my Prime Minister begins:-   -Replying to your personal message of 29th November received yesterday regarding Egypt, information received from day to day has been much appreciated and from our point of view gives a sufficiently clear outline of the course taken by the British-Government.     With regard to your statement of the policy of the British Government to protect the Suez Canal we believe that all countries as well as the British Empire are interested in the preservation of the freedom of this route and we assume that the rights of all nations will be fully recognised.     Ends.Telegram from, the Governor of Newfoundland to the Secretary of State for the colonies. (Received 1st December, 1924),1st December.In reply to your telegram of 29th November.   Secret. I have conferred with my Prime Minister with respect to the information sent relative to the Egyptian situation and Mr. Monroe is satisfied that the - particulars -supplied are both ample and sufficient.6.Telegram from the Governor General of Canada to the Secretary of State for the Colonies. (Received 2nd December, 1924).
Telegram from the Governor General of the Union of South Africa to the Secretary of State for the Colonies. (Received 2r;&quot; T-sjember, 1924),ISecret 02nd December   Your secret telegram of 29th November Following for you from m,; Prime Minister beginsWe desire to thank His Kajesty&apos;s British Government for enquiring from us whether the information so far sent to us in regard to Egypt is sufficient or whether we would wish it amplified   n any respect.Feeling that the Union is not directly concerned in the dispute between Great Britain and Egypt we have so far not felt any necessity for information except such as the BritishfGovernment&apos;may from time to time think fit to be placed at our disposal.Under these conditions we have no reason not to,look upon the information so far supplied to us as sufficient and have no suggestions to make as to its amplification in any respect.In conclusion we desire to express our aoprecia&apos;ion to the British Government for the favour shown us by intimating what its policy is in respect of the Sudan and Egypt and while disclaiming any intention of interfering much less of participating in the dispute with which the Union has no concern we cannot but express very earnestly the hope that everything will be done to obviate further strife and bloodshed.     Ends,.
Telegram from the Secretary of State for the Colonies to the Governor General of the Commonwealth of Australia. (Sent 4th December, 1924).Secret and Personal,Please give following message to your Prime Minister   ; begins,.     Your message of 1st Decembert     I am most anxious to meet your wishes but I do not think you have allowed enough for the difference between conditions as regards press and official communications which makes competition in point of time practically impossible as regards actual events in Egypt and Sudan,     Correspondents telegraph at once en clair the moment they see or hear something has happened.     Official information has to go through senior responsible official on the spot through Cairo Residency to London and then to you and has to be coded and decoded more than once in the process, British Government is after all in this respect in much the same position as yourself.     For instance the news of the occupation of the Customs at Alexandria got to the. London Press before it reached the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and he had to telegraph to Lord alien by for confirmation.     Similarly first news which reached Foreign Office of Mutiny of Sudanese regiment to which you refer was from London evening papers.     In the circumstance we thought that you and other Prime Ministers would prefer us to concentrate so far as possible on the instructions sent to Lord alien by and aspects of the situation which were not in Press and instructions were given accordingly. We greatly appreciate your support of the general policy which is being followed     Endso AMERY
