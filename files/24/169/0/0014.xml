17514/15968^8.For Qftmflatjpn, to. Gefclnel.American Reparation.I circulate to my colleagues a memorandum communicated by the United States Ambassador on the subject of American participation in the payments to&apos; be made by Germany under the Dawes plan,, together with the draft reply which I mentioned in the Cabinet,A. C.FOREIGN OFFICE, November 28th, 1924..
I,-icFpreign Office,November        1924.DRAFT, merican Ambassador.Your Excellency:-I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of the memorandum which you hand-; -ed to me personally at our interview on November 19th in explanation of the views of the United States government regarding their participation in the payments to be made by Germany under the Dawes plan.2,    In that memorandum Your Excellency explains the reasons which, in the opinion of your government, justify this demand.    They divide their claims against Germany into two classes(1)   costs for the maintenance of the American army of occupation;(2)   claims for damages to persons and property.3,    Your Excellency will recollect that during our interview I repeated to you the assurance already given to you verbally on October 27th by Sir E. Crowe that so far as His Majesty&apos;s Government are concerned the question regarding the costs of the American army of occupation has already been disposed of.    An agreement regulating, that question was signed .......
signed on May 25th, 1923, as Your Excellency records in your memorandum under reply, between the United States and the Principal Allied Powers.    The principle at stake has thus been settled, and His Majesty&apos;s Government do not anticipate any difficulties as regards that matter.4.    As to the second claim advanced by Your Excellency - that for damages to persons and property - His Majesty&apos;s Government understand from your memoran-dum that it is based not only on treaty rights but also upon a passage in the Dawes report and upon grounds of common equity. . It is with sincere regret that as regards the legal position which Your Excellency seeks to establish His Majesty&apos;s Government are unable to see eye to eye with the American government.5.    His Majesty!s. Government do not wish to treat this matter as one of pure law, but it is due to the United States government that I should state their view of the legal position.    They are unable to agree that Germany had it in her power by her later treaty with the United States government to alter or vary the obligations that by the earlier treaty of Versailles she had already contracted towards the powers which ratified that treaty.    The contention, as I understand,is .......
is that Germany by the separate treaty with the United States of America has undertaken to accord to the United States all.the.rights and advantages stipulated for the benefit of the United States in the treaty of Versailles (including the reparation section of that treaty) nbtwithr standing the fact that such treaty has not been ratified by the United&apos;States.    His Majesty&apos;s Government are however advised that this stipulation covers undertakings which Germany had not the power to give in view of previous obligations which she had incurred.under the treaty of Versailles. By article 248 of that treaty Germany con-stituted the reparation obligations a first charge upon all her assets and she there-fore was not in a legal position to incur any fresh obligation towards another power which had not ratified the treaty, if the effect would be to diminish the resources available for reparation to the allied powers which had ratified.6.    His Majesty&apos;s Government are un-able to agree that the report of the Dawes committee could alter this legal position. The.Dawes committee was appointed by the Reparation Commission (which derives its authority with regard to Germany from the treaty of Versailles alone) to &quot;consider the means of balancing the (German) budget and the measures to be taken to stabilise the.........
the currency&quot;.    Any question as to the states which were to share in the reparation payments, or as to the proportions of the share of each, was. clearly outside the scope of the committee&apos;s functions,7.    I need not repeat to Your Excellency that I do not for one moment dis-pute the explanation which you were good enough to give me of the intentions which caused your government to instruct the American members of the Dawes committee to introduce the words &quot;and Associated Powers&quot; into the committee&apos;s report.    Your Excel-lency must however allow me to say on my part that if the United States government understood the passage to have been inserted for the express purpose of placing on record a formal recognition of their claim to a share of the Dawes annuities, this was certainly not so understood by the British members of the Dawes committee.    Indeed I am informed that the matter was never dis-cussed either in the full committee or in the drafting committee when the text of the report was under preparation, nor during the proceedings of the second committee of the recent London conference, to whose report reference is made on the third page of Your Excellency&apos;s note.
9.    I should add that under the terms of the treaty of Versailles the amount of the damage for which compen-sat ion was to he made by Germany was left to be determined by the reparation commission.    For the purpose of carry-ing out their task in this respect, the commission had to take into account the various claims put forward by the several allied governments.    At no time, so far as His Majesty&apos;s Government are aware, did the American government during the discussions that then took place either within the commission or outside it, file a claim for inclusion in the total to be demanded from Germany. Nor does any reservation appear to have been made by any American representative, official or unofficial, of any possible future right of America to make such claim.    The American government were represented at the conferences held at Spa in 1920 with the object of arrivine; at an agreement concerning the propor-tions in which the amount of reparations when received should be divided between the states entitled to share in the reparations.    There is no record of any attempt having been made on the part of the American representativeseither
(s)either on that occasion or since to claim a percentage . in the allotment then being laid down amongst themselves by tiie allies for the distribution of German reparation payments when received. Nor did this create any surprise among the allied governments since it had become generally understood that the United States Government made a special point of not demanding reparations from the Powers defeated in the war.    In that belief His Majesty&apos;s Government was strongly confirmed when, in a speech at Newhaven on 29th December, 1922 of which the American Secretary of State caused the text most courteously, though informally, to be communicated to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Washington, the American Secretary of State used the following words:-&quot;The crux of the European situation &apos; &quot;lies in the settlement of reparations. &quot;There will be no adjustment of other &quot;needs, however pressing, until a definite &quot;and accepted basis for the discharge of &quot;reparation claims has been fixed.    It &quot;is futile to attempt to erect any &quot;economic structure in Europe until the &quot;foundation is laid.&quot;How can the United States helpin
&quot;In this matter?    We are not seeking &quot;reparations.    We are indeed, asking &quot;for the reimbursement of the costs of &quot;our army of occupation;   and with good &quot;reason, for we have maintained our army Hin Europe at the request of the allies &quot;and of Germany, and under an agreement &quot;that its cost with like army costs should &quot;be a first charge upon the amounts paid &quot;by Germany.    Others have been paid and. &quot;we have not been paid.&quot;But we are not seeking general &quot;reparations.    We are bearing our own &quot;burden;   and through our loans a large &quot;part of Europe&apos;.s burden in addition.   No &quot;demands of ours stand in the way of 11 a proper settlement of the reparation &quot;question&quot;.It was in these circumstances, as I had the honour verbally to explain to . Your Excellency, that not having hitherto I doubted that these words still correctly ! described the policy of the American government the intimation that they now claimed a share in the Dawes annuities in respect of reparations, and apart from the cost of the army of occupation, came Upon me as a complete surprise.10.    I have felt it to be due to Your Excellency and to the Government of the United States of America that Ishould
(o)should explain thus fully the grounds on which His Majesty1&apos;s Government are unable to admit the legal arguments brought forward in Your Excellency&apos;s memorandum, but, as I had the honour to inform Your Excellency in our first conversation on this subject on November 19th and to repeat in our brief interview next day I desire to approach the whole question as one which, as between our two govern-ments, should be settled on broad lines of equity, rather than by strict adherence to the letter of legal rights on which we are to my great regret, not wholly agreed.    Nothing would be more distasteful to His Majesty1s Government than to enter in regard to such a subject into a formal controversy with the govern-merit of the United States on legal points.    It is not by such a procedure that a solution of a practical kind, satisfactory to all parties - such as His Majesty&apos;s Government for their part most earnestly desire - can be most easily arrived at.    What His Majesty&apos;s Government would much prefer is. a friendly discussion of the equities of the case conducted in a spirit of mutual accommodation and goodwill, with a view to an amicable settlement, in the same way
way as was successfully arranged in the matter of the costs of the American army of occupation.11.    I am naturally not yet in a position to give Your Excellency a considered opinion as to the precise lines upon which such a settlement should be sought.    I must necessarily consult my colleagues and more especially the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in a matter which more particularly concerns his department.    But I may state at once that I shall be prepared to submit the above considerations to him for his favourable examination.    In doing so I presume that I may assure him that, as the American government claim a share in the reparation pool for damage to per-sons and property, they will account to this pool for the net proceeds of any ex-enemy assets that may already have accrued to them, on the same basis upon which the allied Powers account to the pool under the provisions of the Treaty of Versailles for all the net proceeds of ex-enemy assets in their possession.    If your Excellency desires an exact statement of the obligations of the allies in this matter, I shallbe
X- &amp;V&apos; ifcrfbe happy to obtain it for you from the Chancellor of the Exchequer or it may be explained to the American representa-tives at the Conference of Finance Ministers.    All I ask at the moment is that the American government..in claiming on grounds of equity to share in the distribution of assets of the pool will contribute to those assets on the same principle as the other partici-pants.12.    Your Excellency Is aware from a communication which I have already had the honour to address to you, that it is now hoped to open a meeting of the Finance Ministers in Paris on December 1st next. The matter is therefore one of some urgency, and I should accordingly be greatly obliged if I could receive some such assurance as soon as possible in order that the principle to be adopted, during the forthcoming discussions may be clearly established before the meet-ing -takes place, thus rendering easier a prompt and satisfactory issue to its proceedings.
CONFIDENTIAL. Sbotion 2.[G 17514/15918/18] No. 1.Memorandum dealing with the Question of American Participation in the Payments to be made by Germany under the Dawes&apos; Plan.[Handed to the Secretary of State by the United States Ambassador onNovember 19, 1924.]IN Section XI, Part 1, of the. Dawes Report, it is provided that payments made by Germany shall cover all sums for which Germany may be liable to the Allied and Associated Powers, but the same shall not prejudice the questions of distribu-tion or priority between the various categories of charges. The clauses referred to are as follows : &quot;Before passing from this part of our report, we desire to make it quite clear that the sums denoted above in our examination of the successive years, comprise all amounts for which Germany may be liable to the Allied and Associated Powers for the costs arising out of the war, including reparation, restitution, all costs of all armies of occupation,. clearing house operations to the extent of those balances which the Reparation Commission decide must legitimately remain a definitive charge on the German Government, commissions of control and supervision, &amp;c.&quot; Wherever, in any part of this report or its amiexes, we refer to treaty payments, reparation, amounts payable to the Allies, &amp;o, we use these terms to include all charges payable by Germany to the Allied and Associated Powers for these war costs. They include also special payments, such as those due under articles 58, 124 and 125 of the Treaty of Versailles.&quot; The funds to be deposited in the special account in the bank are to be available for the foregoing purposes, notwithstanding anything in this report which may be interpreted to the contrary, though, in saying this, we are not to be read as prejudicing questions of distribution or questions of priority between the various categories of charges.&quot;These provisions were most carefully considered by the Dawes Committee. They were intended to make all claims of every name and nature of the Allied and Associated Powers against Germany a charge on the funds in the hands of the agent-general. The Dawes Report was accepted by Germany and by all the Allied Governments by the final protocol of the London Conference, and has been put in force. The conference was fully aware of the nature of the American claims for army costs and reparations. On the 2nd August, the French delegation presented to the conference a resolution, calling a meeting of Finance Ministers to meet in Paris immediately after the close of the conference, for the purpose of allocating the payments made by Germany since the 1st January, 1923, and also the allocation of German payments as from the date when the Agent-General for Reparation Payments takes up his duty, and during the first years of the operation of the Dawes plan. On the 5th August, I sent a letter to the secretary-general of the Inter-Allied Conference, setting forth the nature of the American claims and our right as an Associated Power under the Dawes plan to be represented at said conference and to participate in such distribution. (These documents will be found as follows: French resolution, p. 103, No. 26, Volume I, &quot; Proceedings of the London Reparation Conference, July and August 1924.&quot; Letter from the American Ambassador to London Conference, p. 126, No. 29, Volume I.)The French resolution and my letter to the conference on behalf of the United States came up for consideration on Tuesday, the 12th August, 1924, at which time I explained to the plenary conference the nature of the American claims and our right to be represented at such a conference and to have the American claims paid out of the funds to be paid into the bank by Germany for the benefit of the Allied and Associated Powers. After discussion,&apos; it was agreed that the United States should be represented and that notice should be sent out accordingly.   (See[782 t-2][This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.!GERMANY.   .   . .     [November 19, 1924.]
&quot; Proceedings of the London preparation Conference,&quot; Volume I, p. 49.) Further-more, the American position is in entire harmony with the report of the Second Committee, approved by the plenary conference&apos; on the 28th July, 1924, which provides, in article 4, sub-division (c), that, &quot; with the resources thus placed at his disposal, the Agent-General for preparation Payments shall provide for the payments of reparations and other treaty charges during the transition period in accordance with the decisions as to distribution, which will be taken by the Allied and Associated Governments.&quot; This was intended by the conference to include the United States.The United States has two classes of claims against Germany : Costs for the maintenance of its army of occupation, and Claims for damages to persons and property.The basis of the claims for army costs is America&apos;s participation in the war, the Armistice Agreement, the United States Treaty with Germany and the Agreement of the principal Allied and Associated Powers made the 25th May, 1923, for the payment of these sums. In article 9 of the Armistice Agreement of the 11th November,-1918, signed by Germany and, among others, by the United States, this provision appears : &quot; The maintenance of the troops of occupation in the Rhineland shall be defrayed by the German Government.&quot;In view of the payments made to the Allies by Germany in the global sums handed over to them, of which no part was paid, to the United States for its army costs, and on the theory of our equitable right, in view of services rendered to the Allies by the maintenance of our army on the Rhine, thereby reducing their own expenditures, there was signed at Paris on the 25th May, 1923, an agreement with the principal Allied Powers for the adjustment and payment of these army costs. This agreement has not yet been ratified by France, nor the ratifications exchanged. Roughly, that agreement provides that our army costs of 255 million dollars (on which there have been some small credits) would be divided into twelve annual instalments, and should be, during the first four of the twelve years, a first charge on cash payments received from Germany, or for Germany&apos;s account, after the expenses of the Reparation Commission and the current expenses of the Allied armies oc occupation have been satisfied, but during the last eight years be an absolute prior charge on all cash payments, except for the costs of the Reparation Commission. Furthermore, the Allies agreed that they would apply the value of deliveries in kind to the discharge of their army costs. No sums have been paid to the United States under this agreement regarding army costs, except that Belgium has deposited in a separate account for the benefit of the United States 25 per cent, of certain reparation payments amounting to about 11 million dollars.By the agreement executed between the United States and Germany, the 10th August, 1922, a Mixed Claims Commission was established to sit in Washington and adjudicate the claims of American citizens for loss and damage to persons or property arising because of the war and subsequent to the 31st July, 1914, and also for the settlement of pre-war and war debts owing to American citizens by German nationals. The commission has been sitting for some time and is adjudicating these claims, and it is hoped it will have finished its work by the end of 1925. By our separate treaty with Germany of the 14th November, 1921, Germany accords to us the same rights in the matter of claims which we would have enjoyed had we ratified the Treaty of Versailles (see Part VIII, Reparation Annex I, Sections 1 to 10 inclusive), namely, the satisfaction of all claims similar to those made by the Allies, but the American Government has notified Germany that it will not make claims under sub-divisions 5, 6 and 7, including pensions, assistance to prisoners of war, their families and dependants, and allowances to families and dependants of mobilised persons, &amp;c, so that the American claims which are for damages to persons and property do not include, as do the claims of the Allies, any sums of the type above indicated.In the Treaty of Peace between the United States and Germany, proclaimed the 14th November, 1921, there was embodied a resolution of the Congress of the United States declaring the war at an end. Among other things, the resolution contained the following provision : &quot; Section 2. That in making this declaration, and as a part of it, there are expressly reserved to the United States of America, and its nationals any and
all rights, privileges, indemnities, reparations or advantages, together with the right to enforce the same, to which it or they have become entitled under the terms of the armistice signed the 11th November, 1918, or any extensions or modifications thereof; or which were acquired by or are in the possession of the United States of America by reason of its participation in the war, or to which its nationals have thereby become rightfully entitled; or which, under the Treaty of Versailles, have been stipulated for its or their benefit; or to which it is entitled as one of the principal Allied and Associated Powers; or to which it is entitled by virtue of any Act or Acts of Congress; or otherwise.&quot;The treaty also contained the following articles : &quot; Article 1.&quot; Germany undertakes to accord to the United States, and the United States shall have and enjoy, all the rights, privileges, indemnities, reparations or advantages specified in the aforesaid Joint Resolution of the Congress of the United States of the 2nd July, 1921, including all the rights and advantages stipulated for the benefit of the United States in the Treaty of Versailles, which the United States shall fully enjoy, notwithstanding the fact that such treaty has not been ratified by the United States.&quot; Article 2.&quot; With a view to defining more particularly the obligations of Germany under the foregoing article with respect to certain provisions in the Treaty of Versailles, it is understood and agreed between the high contracting parties : &quot; (1.) That the rights and advantages stipulated in that treaty for the benefit of the United States, which it is intended the United States shall have and enjoy, are those defined in section 1 of Part IV, and Parts V, VI, VII, VIII, IX, X, XI, XII, XIV and XV.&quot; The United States, in availing itself of the rights and advantages stipulated in the provisions of that treaty mentioned in this paragraph, will do so in a manner consistent with the rights accorded to Germany under such provisions.&quot;Aside from the legal right to participate in the payments by Germany to the bank under the Dawes Report and the separate Treaty of Peace between the United States and Germany, which I will hereafter consider, I believe the United States is entitled to participate on broad equitable grounds. It was the associated Power in the war. It contributed very materially to the victory. It incurred large expense by the maintenance of its army of occupation, which has been recognised by the Allied Governments in the Army Cost Agreement. It has just claims of reparation for damages to persons and property of its citizens, recognised and agreed to by the German Government, and ranking pari passu with the claims of the Allied countries engaged in the war. I shall not enlarge upon this point, as all the facts and circum-stances are well known to His Majesty&apos;s Government. But I submit that on technical legal grounds the right of the United States is incontestable. It is true the United States did not sign the Treaty of Versailles. This can make no difference whatever so far as the costs of the army of occupation are concerned, as this is provided for by the Armistice Agreement, which was signed by the United States. But beyond this, the failure to ratify the Treaty of Versailles did not take from the United States the right to indemnity from Germany for losses and damages suffered by its citizens, the same class of claims as those which are being collected by the Allies. It will be noticed that by the Berlin Treaty between Germany and the United States, Germany undertakes to accord to the United States, and the United States shall have and enjoy all the rights, privileges, indemnities, reparations or advantages specified in the Joint Resolution of Congress, including all lights and advantages stipulated for the benefit of the United States in the Treaty of Versailles, which the United States shall fully enjoy, notwithstanding the fact that such treaty has not been ratified. With a view of more particularly defining the obligations of Germany, it is further provided that the rights and advantages, stipulated in the Treaty of Versailles for the benefit of the United States, which it is intended the United States shall have and enjoy, are those defined in certain sections of the treaty, including the reparations section heretofore referred to.
. It has been suggested that technical objections might be raised by some of the &apos; Allied Powers. Certainly, no suggestion has been made that Germany could object. But it has been said that under the Versailles Treaty the reparations of the Allied ^ and Associated Powers were provided for and made a prior charge on Germany; &quot; that these reparations were to be collected by the Reparation Commission; that the Reparation Commission notified Germany of the total amount of claims, which did not include those of the United States; and therefore, the United States could not by separate treaty, claim the right, to share in this preference pari passu with the Allies, I submit that these claims for reparations arose on account of the war in which the United States participated, and not by virtue of the Treaty of Versailles. Furthermore, I do not believe it lies in the power of Germany and a part of the Allied countries to enter into a treaty which would exclude the balance of the Allies in the war from collecting reparations or make the reparations of a part of the countries a first charge against Germany, unless the other countries engaged in the war agreed to such a preference. Could France enter into a separate treaty with Germany, making its reparations claims and army costs a prior charge on German revenues, thereby excluding Great Britain and the other Allies ? If not, neither could the Allied Powers make such an agreement which would exclude the &quot; associated Power.&quot; Nor do I believe there can be any technical objection to the participation of the United States, because the reparations were to be collected solely by and through the Reparation Commission. Likewise, a part of the Allied and Associated Powers could not provide an exclusive remedy for the collection of reparations by the balance of the Powers engaged in the war. The Dawes Report recognises this and provides that the payments made by Germany to the bank shall include all claims of the Allied and Associated Powers, and this agreement has been accepted and put in force by the protocol signed by Germany and all the Allied Powers.The amount of the army claims has been fixed, although there are some small credits to be made. But on the basis of 255 million dollars, to be paid in twelve annual instalments, it would take about 21 million dollars a year. However, by the agreement, unpaid annuities accumulate, and if not paid before, must all be paid during the last eight years. In fact, unpaid annuities have accumulated, and probably will accumulate during the first two years of the Dawes plan. Assuming, therefore, the ratification of the Army Cost Agreement, virtually all of the total sum would have to be paid in the last eight years, namely, 32 million dollars per annum. It is the desire of the United States to facilitate in every way the settlement of the reparations question, and therefore it is willing to recast the Army Cost Agreement and to make an extension of the time of payments, provided -a reasonable percentage of the money paid into the bank for reparations is also allowed on its general claims. The amount of the American claims cannot now be definitely stated. But we are satisfied that an arrangement can be made whereby the total annual payment to the United States for army costs and claims will not much exceed, if at all, the annual payments necessary to fulfil the present Army Cost Agreement. We believe the American claims for damages to persons and property should rank pari passu with the reparations claims of other countries. The army costs are, of course, a prior charge.London, November 15, 1924.
