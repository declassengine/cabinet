SECRET. C.F. 515(24)TH13 DOCUMENT. IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S GOVERNMENT.CABINET. ANGLO-GREEK COMMERCIAL TREATY. memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.II attach a Memorandum indicating the lines on which in my opinion negotiations should be begun for a Commercial Treaty with Greece,     Our relations with that country have been based for many years on an undertaking on the part of His Majesty&apos;s Government not to increase the duty on currants the principal export of Greece to this country, beyond 2/-per cwt.Our exports to Greece are at present at a rate of over 5 millions sterling, a trade which it is well worth while making 3ome effort to maintain and extend.     We have every reason to expect that Greece will be prepared to engage herself not to discriminate against British goods, and if and so long as we do not increase the duty on currants to give ua the further advantage of secured customs rates for our principal exports.     Our traders, particularly in Manchester&apos; are in favour of maintaining a tariff schedule if possible;   and it is therefore, in my opinion, desirable that we should agree not to increase the duty on currants in the immediate future.   Although there will be definite and immediate advantages both commercial and political in securing a favourable Treaty with Greece, we have to consider the proposals made at the Imperial Economic Conference. These proposals were that &quot;His Majesty&apos;s Government are prepared to offer free admission to Empire currants and to consider what increase in the duty on foreign currants may be necessary to make the preference effective, such increase to come into force at a future date to be agreed upon&quot;.
I foresee no difficulty in abolishing the existing duty on Imperial imports.     Any increase of preference, however, could only be given either by increasing the duty or by a subsidy.   But even if it were decided to increase the duty, this in my opinion ought not to be done until a largely increased Empire crop was actually in bearing.In thes9 circumstances I propose to adopt a middle course, which will not tie our hands during the entire period of the Treaty.   I should endeavour to conclude an ordinary moat-favoured-nation Treaty, which would continue In operation for a period of years, but which would embody a special article with a schedule of customs rates which Greece would accord to the United Kingdom in return for the maintenance of the currant duty at the present level, with liberty to either Party to denounce the arrangement separately on giving six months notice at any time.The Clause could run somewhat as followsJ-&apos;&apos;The articles, the produce or manufacture of the United Kingdom enumerated in the Schedule annexed to this Treaty, shall not on importation Into Greece be subjected to higher customs duties than those specified in the schedule.   Currants the produce of Greece shall not on importation into the United kingdom be subject to a higher duty than 2/- per cwt.&quot;Providing that either of the Contracting Parties shall be entitled at any time to give 6 months&apos; notice to abrogate the present Article, and on the expiration , of such notice the present Article shall cease to have effect, without prejudice to the other stipulations of the Treaty.&quot;I shall be glad to have authority to negotiate on this basis.   An early decision is necessary as the new Greek Customs Tariff comes into&apos; operation next month and it will be
necessary to take immediate steps to consult traders as to the principal reductions from the rates providsd for in this Tariff which it will be dasirable that we should endeavour to secure in the interests of British trade,(Intld.)   P.L1.-G.1.12.24.Board of Trade. &apos;
The Treaty of Commerce and Navigation between Great Britain and Greace of November 10th, 1885, provided for most-favoured-nation treatment of the goods of either country on importation into the territories of the other.   The duration of the Treaty was for ten years, after which; it was terminable on the expiration of one year&apos;s notice to be given by either party.   The Commercial Agreement between Great Britain and Greece of March 28th, 1890, provided for the reduction of the duty on currants imported into the United Kingdom from 7/- to 2/- per crft., in exchange for fthich reductions in the Greek import duties on certain textiles and a few other goods were obtained.   Further reductions in the Greek import duties on similar goods were obtained by a Declaration of November 23rd, 1904, which also provided that the Treaty of 1886, the Commercial Agreement of 1890, and the Declaration of 1904 itself should remain in force for five years, after which they should be terminable again upon the expiration of one year&apos;s notice.Greece gave notice to terminate these Instruments on March 3rd, 1919, which therefore took effect on March 3rd, 1920, but it was then agreed, as a modus vivendi, to continue the provisions of the Treaties in force indefinitely subject to the right of either party to terminate them on giving three months&apos; notice.   Greece tendered a final notice under this modu3 vivendi on September 10th, 1924, and the Treaty will therefore cease to have any effect on December 10th next. In giving this notice the Greek Ambassador Intimated the anxiety of his Government to proceed as soon as possible to the conclusion of a new Treaty of Commerce and Navigation and the immediate question for consideration therefore is as to the general basis on which such a Treaty could be concluded.
The nature of the trade   between Greece and this country-is dominated by the fact that Great Britain takes the greater part of the important currant crop of Greece.   In 1922 currants formed more than three-fourths in value of the total imports into the United Kingdom from Greece.   The proportion of the crop taken by Great Britain is about two-thirds of the whole. Further, of the total currants imported into this country, Greek currants form over 90 per cent.   The total value of Greek exports to the United Kingdom in 1922 was 432,000,000 drachmae out of a total of 2,485,000,000 drachmae or 17.0 per cent.The most important exports from the United Kingdom to greece are cotton piece goods, woollens and worsteds, and coal.   For the first nine months of the present year thevalue of these goods exported to Greece has been as follows:-Cotton piece goods ......  1,211,000Woollens................ 271,000Worsted ................. 217,000Coal .................... 587,000During the 3ame period the total value of the exports to Greece of all description of United  Kingdom produce and manufactures was  4,183,000.In the corresponding period of 1922 and 1923, they amounted to  2,983,000 and  2,594,000 respectively so that the trade appears to be increasing.In this connection the following facts must be borne in mind:-(1) Greece, whose population was not much more than 2,000,000, has now a population within its extended areas of&quot; about 5,000,000.(2) This larger population consists to an appreciable extent of refugees and exchange-population from Turkey who more than replace in numbers and economic value the Mohammedans who are returning from Greece to Turkey.   This movement has brought important new industries to Greece.
(3) the restrictive and nationalist policy of the Turkish Government has had important effects in driving entrepot trade from Constantinople and this has to some extent been transferred to the Piraeus. These considerations all point to the fact that Greece, which has always occupied an important position in Mediterranean commerce, is becoming, and is likely to remain, a market of very considerable importance in which British Manufactures have at present a reasonably good footing and which should as far as possible be cultivated.The prospects of preserving and developing our usual trade relations with Greece evidently depend upon the future of the currant trade and this in turn involves the question of the taxation of currants in this country, which has to be considered In connection with the question of Imperial preference.   At the Imperial Economic Conference of 1923, in addition to the general resolution in favour of Imperial preference, the British Government stated that they were prepared to offer free admission to Empire currants and to consider what increase in the duty on foreign currants might be necessary to make the preference effective, such increase to come into force at, a future date to be agreed upon.   At the same time it was proposed that Empire raisins should also be admitted free while the existing duty of 10/Sd. per cwt. was to be maintained upon importations from foreign countries. This being so it is probably undesirable that His Majesty&apos;s Government should give an undertaking to the Greek Government which would tie their hands in regard to the currant duty over a considerable period of time.-Vhilst it might be possible to secure the benefit of simple raost-favoured-nation treatment without giving any undertaking as to the duty to be levied on Greece&apos;s principal export, it may be taken as certain that it would be impossible
to secure to the British trader the protection of a schedule of definite tariff duties on important articles of British trade unless in return the Greek currant producer and exporter had a corresponding guarantee in respect of the treatment of his currants in this country, whilst it is understood that the Greek Government are willing and indeed anxious to include a tariff schedule in the new Treaty which they desire to negotiate.   The problem for solution, therefore, is how to preserve our important trade with Greece without unduly tying our hands.It would seem that this double end could be achieved if we succeeded in inducing the Greek Government to accept an arrangement on the lines of that embodied in the Anglo-Japanese Commercial Treaty negotiated in 1911. -There would be an ordinary long-period treaty of Commerce and Navigation on the usual lines, securing, inter alia, mutual most-favoured-nation treatment for British goods in Greece and for Greek goods (including of course currants) in the United Kingdom, but the Treaty could include a separate article which could he brought to an end at any time at short notice, by which, in return for the obligation on the part of His Majesty&apos;s Government not to impose a higher duty than, say, 2/- per cwt. on Greek currants, the Greek Government undertook not to impose higher duties than those contained in a Schedule on selected British goods.Thus if at any time His Majesty&apos;s Government desired to Impose a higher duty than 2/- per cwt. on Greek currants, the requisite notice to terminate the Article could be given, and though British traders would at the expiration of the notice lose the advantage of the Tarif-f Schedule, they would continue to enjoy the other advantages of the Treaty including the certainty that no higher duties &apos;could be imposed on their goods than on similar goods, the produce of any other foreign country.
It is possible that the Greek Government, who have always attached importance to the relations between the duty imposed on currants and that imposed on raisins, might wish to insist that an obligation not to put a higher   duty on currants than on raisins should form part of the permanent provisions of the Treaty, on the ground that only if so assured could they be satisfied that their principal export was not being discriminated against.   There would seem, however, no objection to His Majesty&apos;s Government incurring an obligation in this sense, as It was never part of the policy of the late Government to raise the duty on currants above that on raisins, nor has any request to that effect ever been put forward by Dominion interests.There remains the important question of the length of the notice which should be given to terminate the special tariff arrangement above contemplated.   There would be an advantage in making the period one of twelve months which was in effect the period envisaged in the case of the Japanese Treaty to which allusion has been made.    If this were done it could be represented to the Greek Government that they were really losing nothing by the arrangement, as, from 1909 to 1920, the existing undertaking not to increase the duty on currants has been subject to a year&apos;s denunciation at any time.    But the Customs regard twelve months as too long from the point of view of budget arrangements, and there might be objections from the point of view of inter-Imperial policy, Since 1920 the Treaty has been denounceable at three months&apos; notice, but the Greek Government might regard this period as too short to afford them the necessary protection and to justify corresponding concessions of any importance to British trade.   On the whole a period of six months appears to   be a reasonable compromise.
A decision as to the course that can be adopted should be come to as soon as possible in view of the fact that the existing Treaty expires next month, and that it is only ifthere appears to be no objection to proceeding on these linesIthat traders in this country can usefully be consulted as to the reductions from the Greek General Customs Tariff which are regarded as most essential to secure in the interests of British trade.Board of Trade,November, 1924.
