Colonel Jones9 E O R Ej T. 10(T^cumgHt^^ Property of ^Hia Britannic Majesty^ Government?--- 1U4\Prom: - General Delme&apos;RadcXlffe^-Tt&amp;JLy * To:-      C.I.G.S., War Office.Desp. 2 a,m., 5th Nov. 1917, Reed. 7.40 a.m..,     &quot; &quot;565.     November 4th.Situation after November 4th.3rd Army is still in line on the Tagliamento. Guns end transport are being withdrawn to the line of the Piave ? also 25th and 6th Corps which are going further back to re-form. 3rd Army is recovering its morale and some of the oorps are now in better order.    2nd Army is also still holding the line of Tagliamento.   Enomyfs advanced detachmentc which crossed the Tagliamento yesterday above Osoppo were counter-attacked by 20th division and occupy at present only a small art?a on the right bank N.E. of Folgaria,   Enemy is attempting to repair at this front insufficiently destroyed railway bridge across Tagllumento,Smal4,,;de^achmcnts of the enemy attempted thrusts on upper Tagliamento against portiona of the 12th Corps which repelled them.   12th Corps now belongs to the 2nd Army and ^s withdrawing methodically to south-west.   The confused mass of troops of the 2nd, 4th, 14th and 24th Corps is being withdrawn to re-form.   Whole of old 2nd Army except a fow sound units will be withdrawn from front to be reorganized at earliest opportunity.4th Army has sent its transport down and is hold-ing its origina;! line with a screen of troops which will withdraw&quot;in due course.There is no change in 1st Army.   There has been some artillery activity in the Sugana Valley suggesting registration.
3rd Army Carps action in the Daone and Qiumella Valleys led to some sharp fighting -in which. Italian -trotps repulsed the enemy with suocess taking some prisoners.On the whole there is some improvement in situation to-day.     Enemy has not pressed on Tagliamento front and Italian troops are recovering themselves while order Is being gradually restored in rear cn L* of C.   There is still no direct indication of an imminent enemy offensive In Tyentino, Headquarters of Italian Intendenza Generale have been transferred from Treviso to Bologna,Enemy is still moving troops by road and by rail towards the Tagliamento,   It appears likely he will rely at first to a considerable extent on the railway from Trieste to Cervignanc and Latisana as the Pleris bridge only slightly damaged by Italians,     Italian General Staff calculates that 3rd Army has about 100 efficient battalions, 2nd Army 24, 4th   * Army 70, and Qarnia force 26, making total of 220 battalions immediately available for defence of Piave line up to its junction with 1st Army.   It is not possible at present to obtain estimate of amount of guns, trenoh mortars and material lost. Work is proceeding vigorously on the Piave defences and if the troops fight well enemy may be delayed for so..te time givingopportunity for the reformed troops to be brought back into line and for&apos;o her supports to arrive.I have been told by various regimental officers that they ascribe rout of the 2nd Army largely to the fact that units were hurriedly marched backwards and forwards in dark and rain and during following day across the very steep Hill and Valley behind the old Italian position until they were dead tirei.     itfhen order ojime for retirement it was given almost simultaneously t* the mass of troops crowded in front of a line from Monte Korada through Cividale and up the Natisone valley.
108Troops were constantly urged to hurry.   There was indescribable confusion, units became hopelessly mixed and numbers of men were so fatigued they could go no further and so fell into enemy&apos;s hands.     These officers represent disaster due not to disinclina-tion of the men to fight but to disorganised and precipitated nature of the retreat.   They believe their men will behave properly when reformed and brought back to their places.     It is their opinion that the anti-war propaganda affects only small part of troops, which began the stampede and that remainder of army is sound enough.     If this should bo true it should soon recover much of its lost efficiency, if given time to do so. But it must be remembered that there will be nothing to prevent enemy from overrunning whole of northern Italy at his convenience if the force on the Piave i3 definitely defeated.Understand Cadorna has decided to endeavour to hold at all costs line of Piave and risk everything in this attempt.
