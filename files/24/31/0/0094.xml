EXS DOCUMBHT IS TEE PROPERTY OI? HIS BRITOTIC MAJESTYTS (X)VESKMEJ!JT*.EC-RETSi*P5*2- cn in ItaigvJScte by Sir E,Garson covering, letter fromMr.A.Beaumont to.Editor-in-Chief, &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot;.I circulate for the information of my colleagues, thefollowing letter addressed to the Editor-in-Chief of the &quot;DailyTelegraph&quot; by his correspondent in Milan, who has been thorssince the beginning of the war.-    &apos; (Intlld.) E.C.2, Whitehall Gardens, SJ. 12th Nov.,1917MI3AH,6th flov.,1917Dear Mr,Le Sage,I would have written to you sooner these days but thedisaster came so suddenly that I was afraid of saying too muchor too little. I sa+j by the paper, in fact, that the extent of the reverse was realised in England before it was here, andthe public in Italy is still to a great extent ignorant cf what has happened.     There is a tendency to blame the Government, theGeneral-in-Chief, Cadorna and even the Zing.But the cause of the disaster as I tried repeatedly in thepast five months to hint in my despatches, is the dastardly and blind socialistic campaign which in Italy has been eating to the very core of the nation.     It would take long to enter into all the particulars and I would send you an article on the causes if you think it ivorth while, but I am afriad no censor will allow plain language..The Italian socialists have had even greater freedom thanthe French and been almost as tainted as the Russians and for
the last six or eight months they have teen preaching in townand village that the people ought to have enough of the warand that it is time the soldier chucked thoir arms.     It isthe only way they said tc end the war.     I sent you all aboutthe famous circular of Lazzari to all the socialist mayorslast August and when at that very time the government was aboutto call out the exempts of all the classes from 1873 to 1898it is this, more than the lack of bread, which the socialistsusod to stir up the riots in Turin.     They had prepared similarriots and strikes here in Milan, in Genoa and at other townsand it ?/as only the fact that the Government partially adjournedthis new call of men that they tempor arily ceased their agitation.Yet Cadorna needed more men and needed them badly for the groatcampaign that was coming.     I wired several times myself showingthat the (Jermano wore preparing a great offensive and on September28th I sent some notes (from my agent at Zurich calling attentionto big movements of German troops across Austrian territory tothe Italian front) to the Supreme Command at Udine.     It was- - jknown th^at a great attack was coming and new troop3 were   hurriedto those linos, but the socialists had done their work.     Thesenew troops wore all tainted with Soviet ideas, with a sullenreluctant spirit and we see they did not even fight   a realbattle.     The few that did fight wore the veteran borsaglieri andsome heroic regiments which had distinguished themselves alreadyin the past two yoars.    But the vast majority were eaten to theoore with socialist doctrines and were ready to give up theirarms at the first opportunity.    Part of the third army whichhad also received some of these doubtful recruits was contaminatedand it is a wondor General Cadorna saved what he did.There is a great despondency hero now.     The Corriere dellaSera people look to the future with dismay.     There is still alarge and healthy part of the population that would like nothing
&quot;botter than to see the allies take net only the military, Vat the political situation in Italy in-hand.     I have nolr. the slightest confidence in the new government of Orlando.. It is the p/^osition majority of Glollitti that got itself &quot;into power with Orlando and they were notorious before the war for their pro-Grcrman tendencies.     It is only on the surface, it s eems to me, that their half-hearted declarations are made.     I hope that I am mistaken, but I cannot help taking this view and rather than cay too much I prefer to remain silent.I am.Yours faithfully,(Sgd.) A.BEAUMONT.John M. le Sago   F:Sq/, 3 &quot;Daily Telegraph-&apos;, &apos; London;
