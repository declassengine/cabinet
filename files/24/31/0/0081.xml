419-2-(THIS JX)CUMBNT IS ;THE PROPERTY 0? HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTYTS GOVERNMENT)S E C R E TG.T. 2581 &apos; WAR   CABINET.ARMY   PURCHASES   OP OATS    IN    IRELAND (Memorandum &quot;by.the Chief Secretary for Ireland.)A difficulty has arisen in carrying into effect the recent decision of the War Cabinet that the Army Service Corps should be prepared to buy oats in Ireland after November 15th at 38/6d per quarter of 312 lbs. This decision has been construed to mean that no oats shall be bought at the price fixed in Ireland after November 15th for Army use except oats which we:gh 312 lbs per quarter.. A like difficulty arose earlier in the year in giving effect to the Droinise made in Parliament last February of a guaranteia^rTce for oats.     A suggestion was then made that the proposed guarantee should be limited to oats of a weight per quarter which is in-applicable to Irish oats.   It was generally, if not universally, recognised that the form of the proposed stipulation would render the promise of the Government inoperative and the proposed form was modified.The governing fact in the situation is that Irish cats hardly ever,  if at all, weigh 312 lbs. per quarter. The proper mode of meeting the case is, in my judgment, to apply the fixed price to the weight of oats purchased, i.e., in the present case the price should be 38/6d for 312 lbs. of good sound marketable oats,I hope the necessary instructions may be given to the Army Service Corps .I ought to add that this matter is brought to my notice by the Department of Agriculture in Ireland, who says upon the subject :-&quot;If there is anything in Army orders that &quot;makes it necessary to bring the oats up to &apos;a higher bushel weight this can be done by &quot;clipping and screening, but these operations &quot;should be performed at the expense of the &quot;purchaser, not at that of the farmer.&quot;(sd)     H.E. DUKE.12th November. 1917
