:o!onel Jones   /S DQCIMEKT IS THE PROPERTY Off HIS, BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERIMSKT -.)3 ?) 3WAR CABINET.6RDER OP THE BRITISH EMPIRE.Memorandum by the Earl of Crawl&quot; old and Ealcarres.As to the general control and organisation of the Ordor, the more 1 examine the eubiect, the more convinced I am that the utmost care must be taken to establish a concise and well defined procedure, based on the guiding precedent ofthe Legion d&apos;hJ;nheur.     I ask for an early decision on this.11urgent matter.I remind the Cabinet that when complete the Order of the British Empire will have a  roll of 22,000 Members.     The risks involved are as obvious as the scale of work entailed. It is an essential that the Order should make a good start, since recovery after a gazette which does .not strike the public mind aswoll chosen, must be difficult and majp be impossible.     It id in order ta ensure the maximum period of cbnsideration by Public Departments that I strongly press for a ruling.The Prime Minister must be ultimately responsible to the King for rebcmmendaticns advanced by Departments, whose responsibility to the Prime. Minister must equally be made clear., for recommendations will be departmentalised in a manner quite foreign to the Honour Lists to whichwe are accustomed.     In normal yeara we have all been able to assess and criticise Honour Liets. as a whole, so restricted have been the numbers and so familiar have been the names and services of the persons concerned.     One unknown name was quite enough to provoke comment.     In this new Order Departments will submit large batches of names quite unknown      outside specialised circles.     No general criterion or standard of criticism will JR. 5 T.- 2577
exist, and a real responsibility for the selection will therefore have to rest   upcm the Heads of Departments who alene will be able.to adjudicate among competing claims. When the Prime Minister thinks it desirable to make revisionn, emissions or additions, the responsible Minister should be invitsd to explain his choice,, otherwise tho balance of his whole list maj be overthrown, with serious reflex action upon the lists of other Ministers.     likewise it shculd be made clear at the outset that each recommendation must pass through the Department responsible for the special service on&apos;which the applicant bases his claim for recognition. Otherwise there will be appeals from one Minister to another -alternative avenues to distinction * a form of competition which would have deplorable results.The wcrk involved is going to be heavy and I ask the Cabinet to authorise the employment of the neceesary staff. Some Department must be chosen to carry on the day to day work, to maintain continuity of method, and to keep Departments in touch with each other.     At first I thought the Treasury with its intimate and personal connexion with all public offices, should undertake the duty, but I now think that the Hcne Office is better suited for the.purpose, and should become the Official and permanent medium of communication. The Secretary should preferably bp a Civil Servant, a man wh** knows the public service well, and whose standing will give him authority to discuss these matters with Ministers and High Officers of State:     Upon his skill will depend the most delicate problem of securing some uniformity of standard r-the task of correlating with particular grades of the Order, the varied services to be reorganised in. different branches cf War Work.     The Secretary or Registrar will require a good deal of clerical help.Two distinct processes are involved :^
(a) The Central Office, to collect, record and classify recommendations, to issue notices and instructions tc Government Offices, to ensure that all organisations and applications are considered, to supervise and check the numbers in each gazette, to answer enquiries, give explanations and grant interviews on all general questions - in fact to provide the Central Agency for everything concerning the Order up to the actual gazetting of the names.(b) A Chancery will also be required to gazette the names in proper form, to keep an accurate register of the recipients as names are added, promoted, or removed, to make arrangements for investitures, to superintend trie manufacture cf insignia; to transmit them to Governors-General&apos;and others to whom the Kingj delegates the power of Invest it axe, to arrange for y/1 ret urn of insignia of the higher grades, and so forth.     This worn would presumably be entrusted to the Central Registry of Oiders at St. James&apos; Palace.Many fresh problems will arise as time goes on, questions relating to new spheres of recognition, to revision of numbers and percentages, to grouping of Departments, to the Modal, to the Cordon or Bouton which members of the Order will probably demand, and indeed the task of managing this Order will be quite   insuperable unless the immediate procedure is defined and a strongly equipped secretariat is appointed without delay.The whole status of the Order is still too vague for the Prime Minister to submit statutes for the Sovereigns approval.     It is however, desirable that provisional rules should be laid before His Majesty.(Signed)      CRAWFORD &amp; BALCAEH3S11th November, 1917.
