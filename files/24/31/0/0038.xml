sCRET.&apos;This Docum&amp;rt \% tfta Property of7184Hi* Britannic Majesty^ Government.)Intelligence Bureau,Department of Information. DRW/017.WEEKLY REPORT ON RUMANIA. XVII. (7 November, 1917).The General Situation.Since the last Report (October 16) the military situation on the Rumanian front has not changed;   the enemy has continued to bombard Gal at i, resulting in the death of many hospital nurses andcivilians.      Against this the Rumanian Government has issued a protest, published in the English press on October 24.   The Rumanian press continues to be full of enthusiastic reports of the successful resistance of the Rumanian army at Marasesti last August.     M. Robert de Flers, editor of the Figaro, who lately passed through London on his way to Paris after spending many months in Rumania, described the battle of Marases^ti as &quot;Rumania&apos;s Verdun&quot;.     The same language was used by Mr Kerenski in an interview with a Rumanian representative, and it represents the feeling of the Rumanian people with regard to the military situation created by their successful defence there. If conditions remain the same there seems no danger of the Rumanian line giving way, and reports state that the Russian troops on the Danube front at least are making every preparation to hola their part of the line.   At the same time it would be almost impossible for the Rumanian army, depleted as are its reserves, to hold out if the enemy were to concentrate his attacks on that front.   A wire from Sir Horace Rumbold (Berne, October 8) gives a report that if the German attempt to come to terms with the Rumanian Government failsas it certainly will fail]   &quot;the Germans mean to have a sharp campaign in Moldavia in the winter, when the weather will not allow of much activity on the Western front.     They wish to drive the
Rumanian army off Rumanian-soil;   they then propose to hold a general election in the country which will elect a Provisional Government which will make peace with the Central Powers&quot;. However gallant and determined is Rumanian resistance, under suchIconditions its success must necessarily depend on the amount of help Rumania1 s Allies are able to give her there or elsewhere.The Economic Situation.The economic conditions continue to be extremely bad.   The Rumanian army at the front, as Is pointed out by the Times Correspondent with the Rumanian forces (November 3), is dependent for its maintenance on local supplies, and the eleven mountainous districts in which it operates, however much they are cultivated by the soldiers and women and children, can with difficulty meet their needs.   The amount of cattle in the country is only enough to supply two meat meals to the troops per week, and the Rumanian Government has therefore decided that, from October 14 on, no cattle are to be slaughtered for the needs of the population, either civilian or military, behind the front, except for soldiers in hospital.In Iasi conditions are also extremely bad.   Even the supply of vegetables, the only food the population could hope to rely on, has run short.   The Mayor of Iasi suggested to the Military Commandant that arrangements might be made by which every country district around supplied the city with one cartload a day of vegetables;   this was agreed to, but the newspapers loudly express their disgust that nothing much seems to have come from this arrangement.     The fuel question, again, is very serious.     The Provisioning Commission has made an arrangement with the railways by which it is hoped to bring 15 to 20 wagon-loads of wood daily to Iasi with a view to the coming of winter, for at present there
t enough even for the heating of the hospitals.   For other mmodities Rumania is at present dependent on import from abroad. Commission recently visited Petrograd to ask for Russian sistance and received a very warm welcome from Mr Kerenski, who gave orders that everything possible should be done.   Another Commission of seven persons has new been appointed to buy food and other necessaries of life in Russia, and especially Siberia.Enemy Methods in the Occupied Provinces.In Reports XV&quot; and XVI some account was given of the two Rumanian nev/spapers appearing under German direction in Bucarest, as well as of the Rumanian &quot;Government&quot; with five Ministers set up in that city.   Their activities receive adequate advertisement in the press of the enemy powers.     The most important among these people are Harghiloman, Constantin Stere, and the Germanophil writers Virgil Arion and Slavic!, but full lists of those politicians and journalists who stayed behind, with an account of their misdeeds, are given in the Iasi press.According to the Rumanian newspapers the German treatment of the population of Bucarest has been very bad indeed.   Act June a Romana (September 26/0ctober 9) gives a long account, which purports to be based on the reports of refugees, of German behaviour there since the occupation of the city last December, and, after describing various atrocities and ill-usage of the civilian population, it goes on to add a story, which may or may not be true, that on April 3/16 last the population attempted a rising which was, of course, suppressed.    In the country districts the population is, of course, worse treated.   Romania (September 19/0ctober 2) learns from a letter from the occupied territory that the Germans have taken away many of the notables from Craiova as hostages and
-Anumber given to the writer by Mr Comsa, who is concerning himself with the relief of Rumanian prisoners.:       Colonel Sturdza, one of the Rumanian officers who deserted to the enemy, is apparently going the round of the prisoners&apos; camps in Germany preaching to them Germanophilism and advising a return to Rumania, where the Germans will treat them ?jell.Even worse appears to be the behaviour of the Bulgarians in Dobrogea, for while the German authorities in Wallaehia are anxious to win Rumanian support, whether by suasion or pressure, the Bulgarian authorities in Dobrogea are merely anxious to rid themselves of an element the existence of which is an obstacle to the recognition of their claims to permanent retention of the whole province. According to Rumanian reports, whole villages of Rumans in Dcbrcgea have been destroyed and all the property of the inhabitants confiscated.   Whereas in Wallachia the Germans keep up a show of local Rumanian administration, in Dobrogea everything is in the hands of the Bulgarians.   Such, as L&apos; Independance Roumaine says, are the criminal methods by which the Bulgarians are preparing for the plebiscite which is to prove to the world that the Bulgarians are in a majority in Dobrogea.Conditions in Transilvania.The new measures introduced by Count Apponyi (Minister of Educa-1-tion) aiming at the 2&apos;agyarisation of Rumanian churches, schools and IIinterned them in a monastery, and that they have also confiscated without compensation such products of the land as they require. Many leading Rumanians, for instance two Councillors of the Court of Appeal at Bucarest and M. Virgil Darascu, formerly editor of Universul, have been transported to Germany and been very badly treated, and It is claimed by Evenimentul that 40,000 Rumanian prisoners in Germany have already died.     (This is just double the
landed property have apparently been partially postponed.     TheRumanian press gives as the reason for this that these extrememeasures called too much attention in Western Europe and Americato the true character of Hungarian &quot;liberalism&quot;.   For practicalpurposes, however, the policy is being pushed on under the form ofthe control of Rumanian schools by Magyar commissioners.   TheRumanian press concentrates more and more on the justifiable cgharajter of the war aim of liberating the Rumanians of Hungary, and points out that this is both a sine qua non of the existence of a real Rumanian Kingdom in the future and is the one hope which inspires every Rumanian soldier to continue the struggle now under the most fearful conditions.   Any recognition of this Rumanian v/ar aim by Rumania&apos;s Allies is hailed with intense joy, and there is no doubt that great delight will be expressed in Rumania with Mr-Balfour&apos;s two recent speeches as an emphatic denial of Austro-Hungaria insinuations that this country was pr-epared to ignore its small Allies and their national aspirations.   Further, the news that American-Rumanian troops have arrived in France wearing the Rumanian uniform, and that among these (in fact, the great bulk of them) are Transilvanians, is greeted with enthusiasm in the Rumanian press as a proof of President Wilson1s friendly interest in the lot of the Rumans of Hungary.   Similar permission given by the Russian Government to Transilvanian prisoners to join the Rumanian colours and the friendly assurances of Mr Kerenski in the interview quoted above should go far to re-assure Rumanians as to the friendly attitude of the Russian Government:    (unfortunately the peace-programme of the Sovyet will have the contrary effect).Bessarabia and the Rumans in Russia.The movement for the autonomous organisation of Bessarabia
is being pushed on with.   Several papers in Rumanian are now appearing In Kishinyov, the chief among them being the Cuvant Tjoldovenesc, now appearing daily.     An illustrated weekly Ardealul (&quot;Transilvania&quot; ) also appears there.   A paper for the Bessarabian soldiers Soldatul Moldovan is also appearing twice a week in the same city.   A conversation the writer lately had with a well-known Bessarabian, Mr Stroescu, passing through London on his way to Paris, confirms the supposition that the Bessarabian-Rumans are keeping an open mind as to their future political orientation and that this will depend on the issue of the war and on the political condition of Russia and Rumania then.   But In any case they are determined to put themselves in such an autonomous position as to be able to decide their own destiny when the moment comes.   Their leaders are taking the keenest interest in the political development of Russia.   Six Bessarabian leaders recently attended the Conference of Nationalities at Kiev and put in a demand for full autonomy for their countrymen.   The Rumanian clergy of Bessarabia were represented at the Moscow Ecclesiastical Congress by Bishop Nifon of Husi and Father &quot; incoca, and, according to the Rumanian press, they received a warm welcome from all the Russian bishops and clergy in whose deliberations they took part.   Most important of all, the Bessarabian troops are anxious to form a reserve regiment of 40,000 men under their own officers with the Rumanian word of command, and this was agreed to by the Russian General (Bhcherbachev) commanding them.Rumanians are also very active at Odessa, where a new daily in Rumanian is shortly to appear.   Odessa is already the seat of the activities of the Lupta, the Socialist organ in touch with the Maximalists.   The two chief directors of this paper are Rakovski and his colleague Bujor, both of whom were arrested by the Rumanian authorities in September 1916 and released by the Russian revolutionaries in Iasi at the beginning of last May.     Mr Rakovski
7.11.17.gives a long account of his experiences in the Nieuwe Rotterdamsche Courant (October 16).   It certainly reads as the work of an honest, though hopelessly extreme, Zimmerwaldian International Socialist, and it may well be that Mr Rakovski, though suspected by all Rumanians of being in enemy pay, is, in fact, an honest person. Certainly, he has aroused considerable indignation among his former friends the Bulgars by his outspoken demand for a Balkan Federation and denial of the Bulgarian claim that Macedonia is a Bulgarian province.   Mr Rakovski spoke with scorn in this interview of the new Rumanian Labour Party, to which attention was directed in pre-vious Reports.   Of its two founders, Messrs Diamandy and Lupu, the former has just died on his way to this country,   Dr Lupu has been here several weeks and has had several   conversations with the writer.     There is not the faintest doubt that he is a perfectly honest and very earnest man and in close touch with the peasant population, with whom he sympathises and for whom he has done much, but it is doubtful if he has the political experience or temperament to become the leader of an important Labour Party in the future.
