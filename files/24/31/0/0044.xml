(This Documents u.* Pro*j*erty of   CtT^y/m^Hi* Britannic Majesty^ Government.)IMPERIAL TRADE POLICY COMETTES.COMMERCIAL TREATIES INTERIM REPORTTQI THE CABINET.In principle there is nothing in the existence of the most favoured nation clauses of our commercial treaties to prevent the establish-ment of Imperial preference.     In practice it would probably be found that they would present consider-able obstacles to that policy.   Apart from this their full and literal enforcement has been found impossible in time of war, and in the opinion of the Committee, would be equally impossible during the period of reconstruction after the ware   Indeed as far as enemy countries are concerned they have ceased to exist during the war and even with res-pect to Allied and neutral countries they have been in practice suspended.   For instance we have quite recently agreed to suspend our import restrictions in favour of France though we have not extended that benefit to Japan or even in form to Italy, still less to Switzerland and Spain and other neutral countries.    On the other hand we have given large subsidies, in effect, bounties, to the Italian orange and lemon trade which we have   -not granted to similar trades in other parts of the world.    These steps have been necessary in order to avoid financial disaster to our Allies while protecting, as far as possible, our own financial position.    The same motives will re-quire us to-pursue a similar policy during the period of reconstruction after the war.-On
On the other hand it is important as far as possible, to give our Allies equal though not identical treatment;   and, subject to the necessity for corning to the assistance of our Allies, to give to neutral nations commercial treatment as nearly equal to that given to our Allies as possible; and as between neutrals themselves to aim not only at equality but if possible even at identity of treat-ment.-     It is, however, obvious that if we are to do this we must take care that enemy nations shall not be able to take advantage of neutral ports to obtain surreptitiously the advantage of any facil-ities we may give to neutral countries.It is proposedt therefore, that a declara-tion should be issued, without delay, with regard to enemy countries pointing out that the war has put an end to our commercial treaties with them, and that we do not propose, so far as they are con-cerned, to renew the most&quot;favoured-nation clauses of those treaties, at any rate in the period immediately succeeding the war, so as to leave o\r hands perfectly free as far as they are con-cerned to make what arrangements we please for co-operating with o\M Allies in the work of recon-structiom    The declaration would go on to point out that we shall necessarily have to take pre-cautions to prevent enemy nations making use of neutral channels to secure advantages which we no longer propose to extend to them.    It is further proposed that our Allies and neutral countries should be informed by circular despatch or other appropriate means that we have found it impossible during the war to carry out literally and exactly all our obligations under the most-favoured-nationclauses
clauses of our commercial treaties in exactly the same wav that we did before the war.    fe have, however, striven to give asjnearly as possible equal treatment to all friendly nations whether Allied or neutral, and we are glad to be able to say that on the whole our efforts in this direc-tion have been recognised, and that such modifica-tions of our previous commercial policy as have been forced upon us by the circumstances of the war have not given rise to any very serious pro-test - a circumstance of which due appreciation would be recorded.    We should go on to point out that during the period of reconstruction we slis.ll be faced with difficulties similar to those which we have had to deal with during the war, and in some respects, perhaps more urgent and insistent than ever.   After developing these propositions suitably we should conclude by saying that we felt ourselves unable to do more in the direction of carrying out our obligations under the most-favoured- nation clauses than to strive to give to our Allies equal, though not identical, treat-ment, and to give to neutral nations the nearest approach to equality and identity which could be achieved consistently with the interests of our own financial and commercial situation, and that of our Allieso    In communicating these views we should hint that if any of the Governments ad-dressed felt dissatisfied with our action thev had, of course, the remedy in their own hands of denouncing our, commercial treaties altogether. This last proposition would have to be stated withproper
proper delicacy and preferably be put upon the ground that we desire as far as possible to pre-serve our commercial relations with all countries intact, and that we had, therefore, not denounced our commercial treaties which would have been the only other way in which the necessities of our position could have been met0The Committee are of opinion that the form of the declaration above alluded to and of the circular intimation of the new policy to Allied and neutral countries should without delay be determined by the Foreign Office in consulta-tion with the Board of Trade. .7th November. 1917,
