XXVIII.. .0-(5 November, 1917).Discussion of War Aims.After an interval of several months discussion of war aims has been resumed.   As this is the most delicate subject that any member of the Russian Government can discuss, it could only have been the approach of the Allied Conference that made Tereshchenko break silence.   Before his speech in the Provisional Parliament or Council of the Republic two programmes of war aims had already been formulated:-   (1) By the Sovyet.    (2) By the Council of peasants&apos; Deputies.   In answering these programmes Tereshchenko had to speak with the greatest tact and caution, steering a midway course between Milyukov and the Sovyet, without shutting the door on any of the demands openly made by Milyukov.The programme of the Sovyet remains as doctrinaire as before. Though the phrase &quot;self-determination of nationalities&quot; still figures in the programme, it is hot courageously applied in the case of nationalities under the Central Empires.     This may be due either to ignorance of the wishes of the nationalities concerned or to a desire not to formulate any demands which would bar the way to a peace by negotiation.   It appears that the programme is honestly conceived;   it cannot be described as merely the result of German propaganda, as it was put forward by the moderate section of the Sovyet, and Skobelev himself is an honest though by no means a brilliant politician.     The author of the programme appears to have been Rosanov, the editor of the Izvestlya (moderate Social Democrat) and Secretary of the Department of International Relations.of the Sovyet.     The Bolsheviks, including Trotski, refuse
to accept it, though they have not themselves formulated any rival programme.   The Sovyet is new so divided in itself that no real programme of war aims is possible for some time to come.   Any programme drawn up by it at present is certain to be revised later on.The Council of Peasants1 Deputies is much more reasonable in its programme.   It too will no doubt be revised later, but it is interest-ing as showing that the peasants&apos; representatives are less doctrinaire than the Sovyet.     In view of the difference of views among &quot;the revolutionary democracy&quot;, it is quite jtapa-SBible for Skobelev to claim that he represents Russian democracy rather than Tereshchenko.Tereshchenko himself had an exceptionally difficult task to fulfil in stating the Governments views on war aims.     The most controversial questions were as far as possible avoided^ the chief emphasis being laid upon the integrity of Russia.   The main points in his speech may be summed up as follows:-   (1) The integrity of Russia must be upheld.   Russia is to speak as a Great Power.   (2) The neutralisation of the Dardanelles is only possible if accompanied by complete disarmament (the inference being that this ideal state of affairs is not practical politics and that Russia should not abandon all claims to the Straits).     (3) Russia will not tolerate being deprived of her ice-free exit on the Baltic (viz. Riga).   (4) A distinction must be made between the Poles, who are to receive independence, and the Letts and Lithuanians.On the following day Kilyukov answered Tereshchenko&apos;s speech. He protested forcibly against the programme of the Sovyet, and insisted on peace through victory, not by negotiation.   With regard to the Dardanelles he maintained that Russia1s interests in the South would not be assurred unless she had military control of the Straits.
As usual, Ililyukov5s views on war aims raised a storm on the Left.    It is clear from the reception he received that the Russian -Government cannot as yet go any further than Tereshchenko went, but the very fact that war aims were again discussed and that the question of the Straits was actually raised is a good sign.    In its statement of war aims, just as in its measures for restoring discipline in the army, the Russian Government is advancing by gradual stages.Movements of the Bolsheviks.The much advertised Bolshevik demonstration for November 2 has been postponed.   From private reports it appears that the leaders are very much divided as to the best policy to pursue.   As usual Lenin and Zinovyev, the ringleaders in the early days of the Revolution, are in favour of making a bid for power, while Lunacharski and Trotski are holding back.   Meanwhile the Government is confident that should tho rising occur it can deal with it. The whole attraction of the Bolshevik movement is the appeal to rapid and decisive action;    the longer they delay the less chance they have of succeeding.   The ^-Government is feeling its way step by step.   It is, of co^urse, useless and impossible to expect rapid improvements, considering both the size of Russia and her economic exhaustion, but much may be done during the winter provided the Government is not attaoked by counter-revolutionaries either on the Right or on the Left.     There is the usual talk of a counter-revolution - this time to be led by General Kaledin - but there is still less prospect of such a movement being successful now than it was when Kornilov attempted it.
Situation in Tashkent.The situation in Tashkent, which at one time caused grave alarm in Petrograd, has, according to the Russian press, improved. The anarchical movement there met with very little support either from the Russian or the Mohammedan population.   The Europeans there number about 70,000 out of a population of 3000^000, the working-classes being chiefly railway employees and artisans. The local Sovyet at first gave full support to the Committee of the Provisional Government that was sent to Tashkent after the Revolution, but the members of the Committee lost influence owing to their ignorance of local affairs.    It was this that played into the hands of the anarchists, who were joined by the Black Hundreds.   For a time they seemed to get the upper hand, but they gained no support from the railway employees, who refused to strike.     The garrison also remained loyal as. well as the garrison of other towns in Turkestan.   The latest news from Tashkent shows that the Government now have the situation in hand, and that the revolt has not spread through the rest of Turkestan.   The Mohammedan population, according to the Russian papers, has remained quiet.5.11.17.
