Bulk of forces have passed the Montecano and are continuing their retirement to Piave.     The enemy attacked the rear-guard at Motta DI Livenza and other points.2nd Army.   General Giorgio continuing his rear-guard action has moved close to Sacile.   Italian troops on the left wing&quot;appear to be behaving quite steadily and Giorgio is enthusiastic in their praise.     Enemy was to-day attacking rear-guard at Sacile and crossed the Livenza higher up.4th Army,    12th Corps now allotted to 4th Army.    26th Division is continuing its retirement, but anxiety still considerable concerning 36th and 63rd Divisions.of which little has been heard.   It was known 93rd and 50th Austrian Divisions had faced north from Travesio against these two Divisions r:hile German 12th Division continued to move west after Giorgio.   Remainder of 4th Army is continuing its movement in good order.       1st Army Corps has reached Montebeiluno and effected its junction with 3rd Army.Spirit of troops on the front is good, but having been marching and fighting almost continuously since October 23rd, they require rest.   Defences so far prepared on Piave are very slight and require considerable improvement if they are to be held under heavy artillery fire.Italian General Staff now calculates that there will be 200 pieces of siege artillery 200 heavy field guns and howitzers and 600 field guns and mountain guns available for defence of Piave line..Everything
Everything will now depend on tenacity with which Italian troops hold Piave line.Still no direct indication of enemy offensive in Trentino.Concentration of stragglers of the 2nd Army proceeds rapidly, and they are being directed into four reforming camps. .Infantry in the Montagnana-Este area, artillery around Este, Engineers near Sanguinetto, transport etc at Monselice and Perrara and concentration will be completed In a few days and number of men collected is believed to be about 400,000,I was in Venice this afternoon and saw Admiral C,ih C. and Chief of the Staff of the Fleet.   Land defences of Venice had been deprived of their guns some time ago for service with field army.   Navy is placing about 50 guns of 4,6,8,10 and 12 inch and about 30 field guns, along the line of the Sele river up to its junction with the Musestre.Inundation of area below San Dona Di Piave has not been entirely successful owing to lack of water in the river, and enemy detachments have appeared near mouth of Sele.    Civil population is being to a great extent evacuated and defences along the eastern side of the lagoon are prepared for action.    Two British monitors are moored north of Chioggia to support land batteries.Admiral said that if British authorities desired to withdraw monitors, he would release them at once.   Also he said he was short of destroyers,  submarines and chasingaeroplanes
aeroplanes all of which urgently required as additional defence.       Shortness of aeroplanes is due to fact that a large number had to be destroyed at Ajello those at Grado having been all saved.
