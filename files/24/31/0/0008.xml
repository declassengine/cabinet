PRODUCTION IN TH3 UHITEP&quot; STATBS&quot;&quot;&apos;G&apos;I jlSBICA.Notes &quot;by the ^^l^^JL^-^^^^-8,1 3u^lies on telegram from Lor a Ho rthol i ffe&apos;7 TgS 2451).(I)     In. my opinion, the British Government should definitely state that they are of opinion that aircraft is how all important in the war, and that America should eon-centrate on the production of aefonautioal material within the limitations of their available tonnage.(2)     Generally, the cable shows a laok of appreciation of the aeronautical problem and does not appear to be based on any definite plan of aerial eompaign.(3)     I am in agreement that the free industrial resources of America are of the exact character necessary for carrying out extensive production of aeronautical supplies.(4)     It is a ma-ter of regret that no reference is made to the manufacture of training aeroplanes and engines, whioh constitute the foundation of any correct aeronautioal programme,(5)     The reference to the possibility of output of finished wood parts is of academic interest on account of the very definite limits existing in the supply of the timber at once.(6)     It is necessary to point out that although America may be making gigantic progress in aeronautical matters,  the net result to the Aeronautioal Supply Department here has been extremely unsatisfactory.     When the United States came into the war, we had certain contracts in America and it is no exaggeration to say that these contracts are not being ful-filled in accordance with estimates.   Further, our supply of spruce has been seriously interfered with, the supply of training motors from Ctirtiss has evon fallen off instead of improved/ and generally the position is extremely unsatisfactory.(7)     With regard  to &quot;liberty&quot; motors, I presume we need order none of these at present in view of the anticipated large future output which, if it materialises, ?/ill provide ample motors for everyone.(8)      &quot;1th regard to paragraph 5 of the cable, I consider the tonnage matter requires very careful investigation and, further, I would point out that the assembly of aeroplanes requires a considerable amount of space and. if America is to ship any parts it is nov? time that those assembly stores were /     arranged.     I pointed this out very carefully in July last, hut so far as I know, no arrangements have been made.   The assembling should take place in France, not in Great Britain.I-
(9)     Taking the American situation, generally, the position at the moment is that vre are not obtaining delivery, of the articled already on order and accurate estimates are difficult to Obtain; for example * m have ordered 1000 sets of D.H.9. Aeroplane Parts and have enquired for 1000 sets of Bristol Fighter Aeroplane parts* both wood arid, metal, but we can obtain ho definite promises of delivery.(Sd) ;EIR.Controller of Aeronautical Supplies,2nd November, 1917.NOTE:-   The substance, of paragraphs   to 9 has been embodied in a telegram from the Air Board to Lord Northcliffe.
