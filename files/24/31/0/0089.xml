(This Document is the Property ofHis Britannic Majesty^ Government.)lbSECRET.Intelligence Bureau,WEEKLY REPORT ON RUSSIA. XXIX.Department of Information.CR7//029.The Meaning of Coalition in Russia.It is still too soon to speculate on the immediate future in Ru3 sia, though it may be taken for granted that the Bolshevikcontrolled by fanatical but not always dishonest intellectuals. It is not correct to dismiss the Bolsheviks merely as a gang of German agents.   Bolshevism is essentially a Russian disease;    it is Tolstoyism distorted and carried to extreme limits.   But in the present case it has been fastened on and poisoned by the Germans for their own purposes.    It is not as yet possible to say which of the Bolshevik leaders have taken German money;   some undoubtedly have, while others are honest fanatics.   Their growing influence during the last few months has been due to (1) The appalling economic conditions. (2) The inability of the Provisional Government to cope with the situation.    At the same time the power of the Bolsheviks is superficial rather than real.     Their supporters among the soldiers only follow them when they see no one else to follow. They change like weather-cocks, as they are absolutely at sea as to what they ought to do.     They do not want civil war, and the Bolsheviks themselves know that they cannot rely upon the Petrograd garrison to shoot down the soldiers that Kerenski may lead against the capital.     But once a definite move is made against them they will crumple up just as quickly now as they did last July.Government is probably already cn its last legs.   It never had anywide-spread support outside a few of the big towns where it was
2.The centre of interest at present lies not so much in the actions of the Bolsheviks as in the consequences that their actions will bring.     So long as the BOlsheviks remained in the background, noisy but irresponsible, they could do more for Germany than they can now, because they could weaken and embarrass any attempt to form a Coalition Government.   It was only when they came out into the open that people realised their impotence.   No speeches from Kerenskl against them could be half as convincing as actual facts, and even if the Bolshevik coup has done harm temporarily, in the long run it will do good.So far as the latest reports go there are two anti-Bolshevik movements, one led by Kerenski at the head of troops who are now advancing on Petrograd, and the other by Rodzyanko, Kornilov and Kaledin in Moscow.   There can, of course, be no doubt that the latter are far more forcible than Kerenski.   They stand for drastic measures for the restoration of discipline and order, for close co-operation with the Allies, for no controversial legislation that will divide the country.   On the other side is Kerenski with his record of recent failure.   At first sight it would appear that Kerenski must inevitably go under.   He has had his chance and failed. While he was talking the Bolsheviks acted, and the Provisional Government fell without a battle.    In spite of this, however, it is not so certain that Kerenski&apos;s day is over.   He may have lost much of his earlier popularity;   he Is not the strong man that many hoped to find in him;   but he is typical of one aspect of the Russian character that cannot be ignored.   It is, of course, uncertain whether Kerenski himself will continue to play a leading role in the future, but it is certain that that aspect of the Russian character which he represents will remain just as present as before.
Russia has stood for two entirely different and contradictory forces in the eyes of Western Europe.   On the one hand there has been Imperial Russia, the Russia founded by Peter the Great and defended by the Cossacks with their strong military tradition; cn the other hand we have been introduced to Tolstoi and Dostoevski with their religion of brotherhood and humanity, to tho peasants with their village commune where the land is owned in common.   Bolshevism Is but the extreme form of this side of the Russian character;   Kerenski is its more healthy aspect.The future of Russia lies in a combination of the more efficient and effective Cossacks, represented by Kornilov and Kaledin, and the idealist peasants and Socialists whose leader is Kerenski.   At one time, thanks to the mediation of Savinkov, a working agreement between Kerenski and Kornilov was almost realised; its breakdown was disastrous to Russia.   It drove Kerenski to the ineffective Left when the interests of Russia demanded that he should call in the support of the more effective Right.   The hope for the future is that tho madness of the Bolsheviks will re-establish the coalition of all the moderate elements:   that, whoever may be the leader, the parties of Kerenski will henceforth combine with the parties of Kornilov.British Public Opinion and Russia.Since the Revolution British public opinion has been annoyed and dismayed at the attacks made on this country in Russia. Certain sections of the Russian press have complained that we have withheld our sympathy in the most critical moments of Russia&apos;s history, that we welcomed the Revolution when we thought it would be to our military advantage, that we turned against it when it

The British public, on the other hand, has protested that the Russian charges against it are unreasonable, that it has stretched its patience to the utmost limits, that Russia appears to forget that we are engaged in a life-and-death struggle.The truth is that from their own points of view both sides are hues justified in being exasperated, but that the British point of view is entirely different from the Russian.   To us this war is the greatest event in our history, it Is a struggle for freedom to every member of the anti-German alliance;   to the Russian the struggle for freedom was the Revolution and it takes him time to realise that in order to preserve the Revolution victory in the war is essential.   They admit that they have not the same qualities of thoroughness and efficiency that the Western Powers possess, but they know that they have other qualities which they will not allow others to trample on.   However exasperating her mistakes and failures, the spirit that animates Russia is not defiled.   Germany may try to poison it but she has not succeeded and will not succeed.   The whole soul of Russia is in the Revolution.There was never a moment in Russian history when both the weak and the strong points in the Russian character were so exposed to public view.   The consequence Is that the Russian atthe present moment is extraordinarily sensitive.    There are depths of feeling in his nature which he cannot express in action but which never-theless govern his actions,  and unless these are understood in some measure he resents it.ft  &apos;&apos;
