MAM MCHAliifcS.In Switzerland the mark rate has still furtherimproved;   on Mov. let and iiov. 5th it stood at 64.30 and 64.20 as compared with 61.50 at the beginning of the previous week.   But the Scandinavian exchanges are again declining. Between Oct. 24th and iiov. 6th the Norwegian rate fell from 42.80 to 40.00 ,   the Swedish rate fell from 34.75 to 32.60;   and the Danish rate fell from 41.50 to 39.00. Successes in Italy carry more weight at Geneva and Zurich than in the 11 or the rn capitals.2*   SCAHDIMVIA.    The United States Authorities are coming to the conclusion that no further progress is likely to be made with the Scandinavian delegates at Washington and it is pro-bable that theee discussions will shortly be transferred to Christiania and London.   iJo definite action is likely to be taken until the United States blockade experts (who have now arrived in the United Kingdom) have conferred with the Kin-ister of -Blockade and until a thorough understanding has been reached between the Allies in London and Paris.Our policy in regard to Norway is the most pressing question of the moment.   The Norwegians realise that they are more dependent on Allied supplies than either Denmark or Sweden and there is a strong movement in iiorway against identifying Norwegian interests too closely with those of her neighbours.   A Conference of Scandinavian Ministers is meeting shortly, to discuss the advisability of joint action in matters of economic policy.    Norway may find herself committed to what will be virtually a Swedish policy If no suitable alternative has in the meantime been offered her
by the Allies.   Germany, moreover, is evidently prepared with offers of oil and foodstuffs and the Norwegian Govern-ment may be tempted to embark upon a policy of exchanges wit3* both belligerents.   The Allies intend, if possible, to secure a total cessation of Sorwegian exports to the eneay.The Swedish negotiations might now with advantage be transferred from Washington to London, in which case it woulU be essential for an American representative to attend,   The Swedes seem willing to divert a large proportion of their ore to the Allies and ere prepared to open negotiations on this point,   Ho doubt a comprehensive agreement on all points will more easily be reached when we have disposed of this more serious difficulty.The Danish negotiations at Washington have reached an impasse.   &apos; he Danes will not accept the proposal of the United States War Trade Board that the whole of the exportable surplus of Danish farm produce other than beef should be reser-ved for the Allies.   It is suggested that these negotiations might well stand over until agreements have been reached with Norway and Holland,   It may be necessary to allow the Danes to export some of their fish and cattle to Germany and these concessions, if they were immediately granted, would necesstf arily hamper us in securing stricter terms from the other neutrals.The German authorities, in order to relieve the German railways   are arranging for the future to send the bulk of Germany1s exports to Scandinavia by sea from Bremen and Lubeek and to reserve the railway routes via Sassnitz, GJedser and Vaadrup for special commodities.EEHLAHD3.   The ^,0*2. have accepted our proposals for a shipping and coal agreement, but they desire to be assured that the United States Government will supply bunkere to Dutch ships
In American ports so long as the agreement is duly observed. They apparently fear that, after having agreed to out? terms, they may be faced with (further demands from the United States.   There are still some minor difficulties to be cleared up, but the main lines of our original proposals are unaffected.   The Dutch will put one ton of Dutch shipping at the disposal of the Belgian Relief Commission for every ton of British coal furnished from the United Kingdom.The report, noticed last week, that the Dutch are contemplating reprisals for our stoppage of Dutch commercial cables has been denied with emphasis by the Dutch Minister for Foreign Affairs,   But the Dutch Government do not appar-ently propose to prohibit the transit of sand and gravel over the Dutch waterways.   They have informed the German Government that they are not disposed henceforth to allow the passage of military supplies through Dutch territory, but the Germans have appealed to the Hague Convention of 1907 and the discussion is now proceeding on juridical lines. Meantime shipments of sand, gravel and other materials of war continue to pass from Germany and Holland to the Western front.The exports of Dutch Agricultural produce to the United Kingdom under the Agricultural Agreement are now on the whole satisfactory.   There is a surplus of 4,327 tons in the deliveries of mi lie and milk-products.   Shortages in the deliveries of cheese and eggs will be made up by immediate deliveries of cheese to the United kingdom and of eggs to the Belgian iielief Commission.   There is however some un-oertainty as to future deliveries of meat.   The Dutch may prohibit the export of mutton altogether ana they are in-dined to raise difficulties as to the financing of our beef purchases.
4&apos; 275jffIT E L&amp;JP.     Sir H. Rumbold has been authorisecL to open negotiations with the Swiss for a loan of It.12,500,000 monthly for ten months.   We regard this loan as a set-off to the credits recently arranged by the German Government for the financing of their Swiss purchases and as a return for the tonnage facilities we are at present allowing Switzerland for her imports.She German deliveries of coal to Switzerland are falling seriously short of the amounts due under the German-Swiss Agreement.   The deliveries in September fell short by 20,000 tone and the deliveries in October are expected to fall short by 60,000 tons.   Swiss commercial houses in Bale are oom-plaining bitterly of the bad quality of the coal received and of Ge many1s breach of her undertakings in regard to the quantities delivered.ITALY.     Though we have agreed to share the cost of purchasing the Italian lemon surplus, the Italians have not yet prohibi-te&amp; the export of lemons, and large quantities continue to pass the frontier into Switzerland.   We are warning the Italian Government that, if these exports continue, the Joint purchase scheme will have to be abandoned.GREECE.   The Greek Government have this weex been invited to cooperate in the general blockade policy of the Allies by drawing up a list of prohibited exports for Greece and by setting up a Licencing Commission to deal with applications for the export of prohibited commodities,   iie pre sent atives of [ the Allied Governments would sit on this Commission and keep the Greek Authorities informed of the economic measures which the Allies desire to see carried out.BGYffg.      fhere is likely to be a serious shortage of fuel inSgypt in the coming winter;   and, unless arrangements are made
for considerable importe of coal and fuel oil in fciie near futufe large areas under cereals, sugar and cotton will go out of cultivation owing to lack of fuel for the irrigating m&amp;chinery At least 200,000 tons of coal and 120,000 tonB of fuel oil will have to be imported during the next twelve months exclusive the coal required for the Egyptian railways and for bunkers.BRAZIL.   She President of Brazil has asked the Brazilian Congress for extensive powers to deal with enemy trade.   The recent sinkings of Brazilian merchantmen have impressed upon him the necessity for drastic measures against the active and widespread espionage throughout the country.   The President has asked for a memorandum of our views regarding the measures to be adopted.   Meanwhile he has proposed to Congress that all contracts with Germans for Brazilian public works should be annulled;   that German banks and commercial houses should be controlled;   that no further concessions of land to German nationals or transfers from Brazil of German property should be permitted;   and that all suspect German nationals should be interned.SHIPPING.   Discussions are proceeding at Washington of thescheme noted last week for co-ordinating the policy of the United States Shipping Board and the Inter-Allied Chartering Executive.   l&apos;he United States Board apparently desire to secure a certain proportion of neutral tonnage for inter-American trades and our original proposals may have to be modified in order to leave as much $orweigan tonnage as can be spared from trans-Atlantic services for employment in American waters in trades essential to the United States.QSBXU anaumn BBMniy.     2he following is a summary of the losses to merchant shipping, due to enemy activity,
