OoJonel Jones(This Docum&amp;yjt this F - op* t\ Hb Srjtbnnic ^sj^tyV. QovernfY88MILITARY LABOUR-r O-fl frit.Note by Sir Norman Hill on the Memorandum by the       r       r Minister of National Service in so far as it relates to the Transport Workers1 Battalions.I am in entire agreement as to the lines upon which the potential reserve of labour in the Home Defence Army should be used, as set forth in the Memorandum, namely0&quot;It is necessary to maintain a considerable force &quot;for home defence.     A large part of this force is &quot;trained in military duties, and is kept mobilised ready &quot;to repel an invasion.     It is therefore primarily a &quot;fighting force;   secondarily, however, it is a potential   -&quot;reserve cf labour-     The man power a&amp; the country has &quot;been so drained that it would be economically unsound &quot;to refuse to use it, when civilian labour is not. &quot;available, and it can be spared from military duty&quot;.. It was upon these lines that the formation of the Transport Workers&apos; Battalions was first proposed in a report prepared by Colonel Hawkins in January, 1915.It was upon these lines that the formation of the Transport Workers1 Battalions was at last sanctioned by the late Far Cabinet in January, 1916,It was upon these lines that the strength of the Transport Workers&apos; Battalions was made effective by the present War Cabinet in January, 1917cIt is upon these- lines that the Transport Workers&apos; Battalions have been, and are beings worked.The/
89The soundness of the Scheme Is proved by the men of the port Workers1 Battalions having this year put in 1,400,000 days1 Lrk without any serious dispute with Civilian Labour, whilst the battalions have, 1 believe, remained efficient for Home Defence. 2, For nearly three years I have persistently pressed for theuse of this potential reserve of labour subject to the conditions laid down in the Memorandum, namely:-(a) That every man of the Home Defence Army employed on civil undertakings must be regarded as primarily a fighting unit and his efficiency as such maintained.(b) That no man of the Home Defence Army must be employed in competition with civilian labour, but only to supplement proved deficiencies in civilian labour.(c) Whilst working on civil undertakings the pay of the men of the Home Defence Army must he at the current rate of civilian pay in the district and for the occupation.(d) That whilst on civilian pay, the man of the Home Defence Army must bear the cost of his own billets so that he may be on real equality with civilian workers.That the potential reserve of labour in the Home Defence Army be used on the above lines has been urged upon the Ministry of Munitions to meet its fluctuating demands for labour; on the Admiralty to meet the deficiency of labour in the shipbuilding yards; on the Railways for the maintenance of the p rmanent ways and rolling stock; on the Timber Committee to increase Home Supplies; and on Mr. Neville Chamberlain, on the formation of the National Service Department.To the failure to use this potential reserve of labour is to be attributed in great measure the serious falling off in our overseas supplies, and to no small degree the resulting advance in prices.   Want cf man power has been at the root of almost all our difficulties in the ^&quot;ersea transport services.Every/
90Every proposal meets with hostility and suspicion but having watched most closely the work of the Transport Workers&apos; Battalions, I believe that the only general hostility and suspicion to the Scheme is that which &quot;has been shown bythe Far Office.So far as I am able to judge there has been no general hostility or suspicion shown by Labour.      Before it was introduced,, the Scheme was approved by Mr; Harry Gosling, and it has been developed and worked under his supervision as one of the Members of the Port and Transit Executive Committee. I have again and again asked Mr. Gosling, and other representative leaders of the Transport Workers&apos; Federation if they were fully satisfied that the interests of the civilian workers were adequately protected under the Scheme, and I have been assured again and again &quot;that they were fully satisfied on this point. So far as the civilian workers themselves are concerned they have worked alongside th$ raen of the Battalions In ports all over the Country without any friction;    on the contrary again and again civilian workers in a port have gone out of their way and. to their own pecuniary loss, to put the men of the Battalions into the way of the work of the port.I agree that the civilian workers resent the introduction of Labour Battalions, but so far as 1 have observed no resent-raent is shown to the employment of a real soldier, and not merely of a labourer in khaki, to supplement deficiencies in local civilian labour.So far as the V.&apos;ar Office Is concerned, its hostility appears to arise from the doubt as to whether a trained man in the Home Defence Army can ever safely be released temporarily from his purely military duties without destroying his military efficiency.     If this is the correct view, then manifestly the Scheme is an unsound one, and the assumed potential reserve of labour does not exist.The/
91The degree to which the fighting efficiency of the Transport V/orkers1 Battalions can be maintained depends in great measure on the strength o  those Battalions.     If the strength is always kept at doable the average number of men employed on civil undertakings, then it is submitted that the military efficiency can be maintained, as the time of each man, after he has been trained, can be equally divided between his military duties and his civil occupation.     So long as the strength of the Battalions are kept at barely sufficient to meet the civil demands, the military training must suffer;   but from first to last, every effort has been made by the Port and Transit Executive Committee to arrange the civil work of the men of the Battalions so as to main-tain the military efficiency of the Unit.There is an imperative necessity for an immediate increase in the strength of the Battalions, both, to maintain their military efficiency and the flow of traffic through the Ports.     The convoy system of necessity creates intermittent demands on the civilian labour in the ports, and unless the maximum demand can be immediately met blocks must ensue in the ports, on the railways, and on the canals.     As it is, the convoy system is diminishing the yearly carrying power of the ships by about 25 per cent, and any blocks in the ports will gravely aggravate this loss of carrying power.These intermittent demands for additional labour can only be met by labour which is immediately mobile, and labour to be immediately mobile, must be under discipline.     Further the   immediate mobility of the labour employed is an absolute necessity if competition between military labour and civilian labour is to be avoided.     It must be possible to withdraw immediately the men of the Battalions directly there is sufficient civilian labour to deal with the traffic.     This can be done with men of the Battalionsas/
fhev always have an alternate occupation, I.e. their primary duty of maintaining their efficiency as men of theHome Defence Army.It is for this reason that the reconstituted Portand Transit Executive Committee recorded on the 25th October 1917, their opinion that the organisation of the Transport Workers1 Battalions provides the best means that has so far been devised for meeting, in the national interests, the fluctuating demands created by temporary deficiencies in the supply of civilian labour in the Transport Services.Dealing with the points of detail raised in the liemorandum -Conditions of employment in the Transport Workers&apos; BattalionsNo man has been retained in a Battalion against his will j     every man has either voluntarily transferred into a Battalion, or if compulsorily transferred in the first instance, has been given the opportunity of transferring out to some other Home . Befence Battalion..  No man has been retained in a Battalion who is not, or cannot be made into, an efficient unit in the Home Defence Army.No man has been employed when civilian labour has been available. Ipswich and Hewhaven casesIf the services of the men in question were needed as dock workers in the ports at which they lived, they should never have been enrolled in the Army.If their services were not so needed, but if they could never be made into efficient soldiers they should have been enrolled in Labour battalions and employed on purelymilitary/
9military labour.     They should not have been transferred toTransport Workers 1 Battalions.If the enrolled men could have been made fit for HomeDefence, but not for Active Service, they ?rere properly drafted into a Transport Workers 1 Battalion.     There they could be trained for Home Defence, and their potential reserve of labour, after training, not wasted.     In many cases, applications have been made by the Labour Leaders for the transfer of such men into the Battalions, Withdrawal of the Labour Members from the Local Port andTransit CommitteesThe complaint made was that men of the Battalions were &quot;introduced without sufficient care being; taken before-hand to organise the available civilian labour1  and that this had happened was attributed by the Labour Leaders to the separation of the functions of the Committees representing different departments in the Ports.It was not suggested that the Battalions had been introduced when civilian labour was available.At the first Meeting of the reconstituted Port and Transit Executive Committee, held on the 25th October, 1917. it was, on the motion of Mr* Gosling, resolved unanimously that the Labour Members be re-appointed on the Local Port and Transit Committees. Bristol caseI have no knowledge of this case.     No man of the Transport Workers&apos; Battalions has ever been employed in Bristol, Avomnouth or Portishead. RailwaysThe volume of cargo that can be dealt with in the Ports, and therefore the volume of cargo that can be carriedin/
I tj,e ships depends, in the main, on the rate at Y-hich it Li be carried over the Railways, and that, in great measure, Ipends on the rapidity with which the railway 7/agons are laded and discharged.On the Railways, the work of the men of the Battalions [as teen strictly limited to that incident to the leading and Bhe discharging of wagons, so as to maintain the flow of tra&quot; ficIfceol WorksThe men of the Battalions are employed only on work ncident to the discharging of the wagons.   This work had to be ndertaken as the Iron Ore ports were becoming blocked,  and the ischarge of the ships delayed for want of empty wagons.Here, again, the work of the men of the Battalions is itrictly limited to maintaining the flow of traffic, over the Banal s.   The Railways are overburdened, and the Canals must beIIsed to their utmost if the flow of traffic is to be maintained ihrough the Ports.(Signed) Norman Hill, fort and Transit executive Committee, -at November, 1917.
