i 8&quot; HALLrn1I.S.R.20.(This Document is the Property ofi3B6SiAai*aiau*i-uwuj** iiii a mini i *m*u lu&quot;*&quot;wniiMuau nmtwMMr i * i.........mi, illvmmmwmmmv^iiiw.)- :is Britannic Majesty^ Government;flolcnel Clones422RECRUITMENT AND ORGANISATION OF WOMEN ENROLLED FOR WORK OF NATIONAL IMPORTANCE.The members of the War Cabinet are already aware of the want of co-ordination which exists in the recruitment and organisation of women enrolled for work of national importance, and of the lack of uniformity in rates of pay and other conditions which are offered to such women.At the present time, a large number of Independent organisa-tions aro reoruiting women for work of greater or less degree of urge ncy.The organisations enrolling unpaid workers include among many others the Joint V.A.D. Committee, the Womenfs Volunteer Reserve, the Womenfs Emergency Corps, the Women^ Reserve. Ambulance (Green Cross), the Y.M.C.A., the Y.W.C.A., the Church Army, the Salvation Army, the Women&apos;s Catholic League, and the Munitions Canteens.Paid women workers are recruited both directly by Government Departments, and indirectly for Government Departments by Independent organisations, in some cases through the machinery of the Employment Exchanges, in other cases by independent machinery.   Thus, the War Office obtain women by different methods for tho W.A.A.C.. the Joint V.A.D. Committee, the Navy and Army Canteen Boards, the Aimer ic Paget Corps, the Timber Supply Department, the Forage Committee and the Remount Department,   The Board of Agriculture obtain women through the Food Production Department and the Wood3 and Forests Department: tho Board of Agriculture still use the N.S.V, enrolment scheme.   One section
of the Women&apos;s Legion, which has not become merged in W.A.A.C., still appears to recruit and supply women to the Board of Agriculture and to Munition Canteens.   At the same time, the Ministry of Munitions and the Admiralty recruit large numbors of women direct for munition works; some Government Departments in accordance with the instructions of the Treasury recruit their clerical staffs from the Civil Service Commission, others do so independently.Although the 3ame machine i.e,, the Employment Exchanges, is used for the most part by some of the organise-tions mentioned above, the standards required and the wages offered are so far from uniform that a spirit of rivalry is bound to exist.   All these, and other organisations as well, (numbering in all upwards of 80) are indeed, in active corn-petition.   No attempt is made to determine any priority of demand.   The services of many women are lost either pormanontly or for a considerable time owing to their being refused Sm-ployment by the particular organisation to which they apply, while other organisations, urgently needing their services, fail to get into touch with them.   Other women who secure employment are placed on unsuitable work.   It has been represented to me, for example, that highly educated and trained women, who would be of great value in Government Offioos are being employed in guarding haystacks by night.   Again, the most varied rates of pay and conditions are offored for practically the came work, The reault is, waste of money, waste of effort, abusos arising from want of proper supervision, and above all, real loss of woman power.
12.11. IT?I desire a ruling from the War Cabinet that I am to be responsible for controlling the general policy with regard to the recruiting of women.I propose to convene a conference of representatives of the more important organisations which obtain women for work under Government- Departments, and of the Ministry of Labour and other Government Departments interested in order to try and frame a co-ordinated scheme for the recruiting-, administration and supervision of women workers.A.
