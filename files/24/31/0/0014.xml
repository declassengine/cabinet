......MH1IIIIIIIHIIH.HHI Hill(This Document It ths Property of ^^tf\    His Britannic JMIsjegtVs Government.)        &quot;MwM-lMi107i:A73RJfITY AND IHI&apos;A.f*P WKLFARE BILL.The memoranda circulated &quot;by Sir 3^in Cornwall (G.T.2460) - n* Dr. Ad^ison (G.T.2458) require a short pnwer from me.Both urge that the Bill ought not tt extend to the Rural District Councils or to the smaller Urb^n Council a.   I agree that es p. general rule the smaller sanitary districto can &quot;be served more efficiently &quot;by m County soheme.   That policy has been laid rfown in more thm one Local Government Board circular.    Hot p!1 County Councils, however, are full of zeal in this natter f;nd not all the minor nuthoritieB are supine. Under the Bill the control of the whole working is with the Local Government Beard, and I w*nt to take advantage of zeal and activity wherever it exists, and at the same time to secure harmonious working between the loc-l authorities.    The natural development of the organisation of local government in the direction of control by the larger puthorities will thus be furthered with the maximum of efficiency and the minimum of friction.     Any proposal to dispossess local authorities of territory which they at present occupy woul^ provoke opposition which I wish to avoid.I an willing, in order to meet Sir uilrtwin Cornwall*e objection, to h*?ve words a^dea to the Bill to make it clear that the powers of the Bill do not include powers for the establishment Of domiciliary medical attendance under the Bill. Dr. Addison, if X understand him, appears to take a view directly opposed to Sir 3dwin Cornwall, for he objects to my proposals becriufe they do not embrace domiciliary medical attendance.    I hnve no intention or desire to raise this debaieable question on this Bill.J cannot meet Sir Edwin Cornwall&apos;s luct proposal, which apparently is that the Insurance Committees, financed by the Sxehequer, should be given the aame powers with regard to maternity and infant T7elffre as tho Locnl Authorities possess. Apart from other considerations, Parliament would never authorise two rival bodies being set up to do the e*me work in the 9*?me areao, the one financod entirely by the State - for it is obvious that non^elected Bodies will never be allowed to spend thfl money of the ratepayers - an^ the otht^r finning half the outlay from the rates.    This is not without its importance for the Chanoellor of the Exchequer.I must impress upon the War Cabinet the urgent necessity for their concent to the introduction of the Bill forthwith, anrf to the ratification of the agreement with the Board of Education to whioh I referred in my nemormdum of the 23rd October.    As I stated before, neither of these proposals prejudges in any way the question of a kinietry of Health and work of most vital importance to the frntion, for which as things stand   I am responsible, is being hpxipered and hindered by the failure to give effect to them.tf, HAYBS FISHER.5th November, 1917,
