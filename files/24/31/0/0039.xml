(This Pocum^t ^^^^lL2l^- ^i---Hi* Britannic MalcrtW Government.)CO2 53^XLDEPARTMENT OP INFORMATIONINTELLIGEECE BUREAU.WEEKXY    REPORT     Oil     GERMANY 8 November, 1917.1.      Th6 catastrophic hlow dealt to Italy on the Isonzo front has greatly heartened the Germans in a variety of ways. The military &quot;victory&quot; in itself is described in many German quarters as the greatest in the war in point of captured men and material, and it is also regarded as of extreme importance in its prospective effect upon the whole war.The blow dealt to Italy is moreover regarded as a justification of German diplomacy and of the Reichstag &quot;peace resolution&quot; of last July 19.    As Herr Mflller-Meiningen said in a speech to Bavarian Liberals the other day:   &quot;No one can now taunt us with having adopted the resolution out of weak-ness&quot;.     In Germany it will he considered clever diplomacy that Austria-Hungary should have piped peace and that the German Government, in its reply to the Pope, should have adopted (in an equivocal way) a polioy of &quot;no annexations and no indemnities&quot;, while, at the same time, the blow on the Isonzo was being prepared for the eventuality that these &quot;overtures&quot; should evoke no response.1&apos;ith the chorus of exultation there also mingles a fresh chorus of slander.     The despatch of British troops to reinforce the Italian front is described in the Press as being partly a police measure intended to bring Italian deserters and waverers up to the scratch, and it is again alleged that English officers in Russia were employed on similar work. The object of these assertions is manifest.     Altogether Germany, confronted, as she is always reminding herself, by so numerically vast a coalition of adversaries, has gained such a
fresh Bense of military prestige, that even if she were ultimately defeated, a new German legend comparable to the Napoleonic one, would survive as e permanent source and in-spiration of militarism.     It would indeed be futile to deny that these Italian victories have given the Central PowerB a new lease of life, and have provided them with assets, whether they remain in occupation of Italy or not, which will prove of enormous value to them.2.      Too much emphasis cannot be laid on the fact that the success on the Italian front has not diminished the internal political difficulties of Germany and Prussia.    It may safely be asserted, for example, that if the victory had come a month earlier, it would not have saved Michaelis.    On the contrary, by relieving - perhaps in an unwarrantable degree - popular anxiety about the course of the war, the victory has made it possible for the political reformers to press their pause without incurring the charge of being oblivious to the para-mount demands of the front.     The appointment of Count Eertling as Chancellor represents a partial success of the reformers, first, because his candidature was combated by the Pan-Germans and the reactionaries, and secondly, and far more important, beoause he made his acceptance of office oondition-al upon the result of previous consultation with the leaders of the Reiohstag parties.    The reformers are almost as pleased about those consultations as they are about the military vio-tory.    They, including the Socialists, have been pursuing what they regard as very adroit tactics in not forcing a candidate, or even a list of candidates, upon the Emperor.    Nor have they insisted that the Kaiser should consult them directly.     They have communicated with him through the Chief of his Civil Cabinet, Herr von Valentini, who is officially a kind of private Secretary.    But the ignorance of the situation which
appears to have been displayed by Valentin!, his attempts to keen Miehaells in office, and the general belief that he was largely responsible for the unfortunate appointment of Michae-lis, have raised anew the whole question of the Civil Cabinet, which is suspected of being constantly accessible to reactionary influences.     The question of the Military and Naval Cabinets of the Emperor, already raised by the Committee of the Reichstag which is elaborating a scheme of constitutional reform, has thus broadened into a discussion of the whole system of the Emperor1s &quot;irresponsible advissrs&quot;, who form the subject of a very old grievance on the part of the majority of the Reichstag and the people.     The &quot;rival Government&quot; fNebsuregierung), Cabinett-regierung, and the Cemerilla are old catchwords of the Centre, the Radicals and the Social Democrats.3,       It would be easy to underestimate the importance of Germany&apos;s domestic difficulties in their bearing upon the prospects of the war.     It must be borne in mind that these difficulties have in no way been solved by the appointment of Count Hertling, a man of ability and of parliamentary exper-ienoe no doubt, but unlikely, from his antecedents, to solve the domestic crisis.     Ee is in his seventy-fifth year, his health is far from good, and he has, during the last years of his Bavarian Premiership, shown slackness in the management of the Bavarian Cabinet.     Indeed, a Bavarian ministerial crisis is just now in full swing, owing to a conflict between the Railway Minister and the Finance Minister, the former having brought forward a scheme for the benefit of the railwaymen without consulting his colleague about its finanoial conse-quences.     The way in which Count Hertling has dealt with this Bavarian crisis, or rather, has neglected&quot; it., is considered to augur unfavourably for his future at the head of the
Imperial Government.     He Is described as ignorant of the menwhom he selected as his Cabinet colleagues, and consequently,as unable to keep them in hand.     Count Hertling&apos;8 prospectsin the Reichstag are far more important than his views onforeign relations and his peace-terms views, which, indeed,cannot at present be accurately ascertained.     He is consider-to be a supporter of the &quot;peace resolution&quot; of July 19,but the &quot;peace resolution-&apos; has now      next to no significance,as it is interpreted, even by Socialists and Radicals, in asense which would exclude neither annexations nor indemnitiesif circumstances permitted.     Thus the leader of the RadicalOpposition in the 3avarian Chamber, Herr Mttller-Meinlngen,has just been declaring:&quot;The question what in the long run we shall do in Belgium must always be met by the other question - Will England evacuate Calais, Mesopotamia, Cyprus and Egypt?&quot;If such views be expressed by a leader of the Hadioal left,it is probable that a Qonservative Clerical like Count Hertllngwould go at least as far.    He will be prudent enough, however,not to compromise Ktthlmann1s taotios.4.      In home affairs the attitude of Hertling may well cause dissensions which cannot be without far-reaching influ-enco.    He belongs in politics to the Right of the Centre, which in the Reichstag has always gravitated towards the Prussian Conservatives.    Is recently as October 26, he ezpres-sed himself in the following terms with regard to one of the cardinal demands of the political reformers, the repeal of the Article (9) of the Imperial Constitution forbidding a member of the Federal Council to be at the same time a member of the Reichstag:&quot;If a member of the Federal Council could be at the same time a member of the Reichatag, he either would put himself personally in a quite impossible position, or he would break up the existing Constitution.     The members of the Federal Coancil vote according vo the instructions of their respec-tive Governments fi.e. the Governments of the German States);
the Reiohstag Deputies vote according to their own convie-tions or the directions of their party or of their electors, The result would be an irreconcilable contradiction, or else it would be the beginning of parliamentarism.     The previous speaker (a Radical) said that the Bavarian Ministry was in a oertain sense a parliamentary or a party ministry.     I must emphatically repudiate that notion.     When the Prince Regent called me to office, it was, I am convinced, not because but although I was a member of the Centre Party in the Reichstag and in the Bavarian Diet....-Now, as to the formation of a responsible Ministry of the Empire, which the previous (Radi-cal) speaker has advocated, I must remind him that we (the Catholic Centre) under Windthorsfs leadership, voted empha-tically against a responsible Ministry, and did so in the interest of the federal character of the Empire.     And we had Prince Bismarck behind us.     There is many a thing in the con-stitution of our Empire that needs alteration.     But we must not touch its federal foundation.     It is in keeping with the unsophisticated character of the German people.    We need a single head to keep us together, in order to concentrate and maintain our power in our foreign relations.     We likewise form one single eoonomio area.     We are all bound up together, and want to remain together.    But we are at the same time the German people in its many varieties, which, as its whole history shows, cannot stand centralisation on one pattern, but wants to work out its diverse Capacities in autonomous separate states.     This is my standpoint and will remain so long as I have any say In the matter&quot;.It may be noted in this connection that the Committee of theReichstag for the revision of the Constitution has air eadyToted the repeal of this paragraph 9 and regards it as a vitalpoint.o.      The Social Democrats in particular do not like Count Hertling, and he does not like them.     He came into power in Bavaria in 191  in a Government crisis which arose out of what the governing party - the Centre - considered to be a lack of firmness in dealing with the Socialist Union of Railwaymen. This the Socialists have not forgotten.    During the Reichstag elections of 1907, he was one of the Bavarian Catholic Profes-Bors who signed a protest against the cooperation of the Catholic Centre with the Socialists in some of the local con-tests.     It is pretty clear that one of the main things which have reconciled the Emperor, his entourage and the Lutheran Conservatives in political life and in the Army, to Count Hertling1 s appointment, is the hope that he may be able to
fcrm in the Reichstag a majority &quot;bloc of the Conservatives, the Catholic Centre, the National Liberals, and even some of the Radicals, to the exclusion of the Socialists with their far-reaohing constitutional demands.     But that would be a veiy dangerous policy during the war.     The Frankfurter Zeltung says that it would put the whole of Labour and the class immis-diately above the working classes, into an attitude of opposi-tion.    Even the &quot;Christian Trade Unions&quot;, organisations a^SAieH/omed to combat the Socialists, have just entered a warn-JLiig-against alienating the Socialist masses at such a critical moment.    The supply of munitions, they urged, depended upon Socialist cooperation, T7h^.l3 after the war, the aid of the Socialist masses wo?il&amp; bo ind^*poj^Jablo for the work of reeon-struoti&amp;n.     If, after the tflasco of Michaelis, his successor were to drive the Socialists into bitter opposition, a conflict might arise, the effects of which might greatly outweigh the advantages gained by the offensives on the Russian and the Italian fronts.     Indeed, as the Christian Trade Unions de-alared, such a situation might turn into a real calamity.6.      There are reports that Hertling, when he meets the Reichstag, will on the strength of the South-Western victory make a speech which, while avoiding the appearance of peace overtures, will open up prospects of peace on the eld German lines, i.e. a non-committal Interpretation of the Reichstag1 s Resolution and of the German reply to the Pope. This he may do, and he may do it skilfully enough, in the manner of his old Reichstag speeches, not to provoke the hostility of the Conservatives or of the Left.    But it is unlikely that he will venture beyond generalities.     It is home policy, as already explained, that will probably test
bis staying power.     If be has to go, Kuhlmann may think that the succession is ripe for himself, as it became ripe, on Prince Ghlodwig Kohenlohers resignation, for BtLlow, then in Kflhlmaru^s present post.     There might, however, be objec-tions to one Bavarian immediately succeeding another.    At any rate, the out-and-out Prussians would probably make the most of this objection.
