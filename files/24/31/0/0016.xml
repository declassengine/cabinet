(This Document 1* tm Property cfHis Britannic Majesty^ Government)AIR BOARD./r13153/40.Report to the Cabinet.3rd November, 1917.1. The annexed table represents the result of aninvestigation of the probable output of aircraft during the next 9 months and shews the number of squadrons of aeroplanes of the R.F.C and additional forces which are likely to be available at various dates.       It is understoodj however, that some difficulty may be experien-ced in manning this number of squadrons.2e The Board have had before them the questionof experiments with.a view to providing an illumination scheme as a means of helping to combat night raids by enemy aircraft.        The magnitude of the cost, not only in money but in material and labour, of any scheme calculated to give adequate light to enable enemy aircraft to be detected and fought at great heights makes it doubtful whether anything practical can be done in this direction Nevertheless the Board think it necessary to pursue every line of investigation that offers any hope of furnishing a solution of the problem and are asking Dr. Parshall who is a great electrical engineer to conduct experiments in this connection.3. The previous report referred to a proposalby Messrs. Reuters Ltd. to establish an aerial express service between London and Paris.        The French Government have now signified to the Board their desire to take up a scheme of this kind and have proposed a conference.&apos;Ply. 4. Deliveries of engines and aircraft have beenas follows:-Engines Aeroplanes Seaplanes,Total for the week ending 27th October Total for the 4 weeks to 27th October Total for September 1917 Total for September 1916Including 139 from Franco and 21 from the U.So-1.
