SWar Office.Handed in 6oil.17,Received 8.11.17,3.20 a,m1352.   November 6th.An officer and assistant to a prominent member of the General Staff came to me this morning to ask us to bring all possible pressure to bear on the Russian Government in Petrograd to have clothing sent to the front.   He said the number of men who really wanted to remain on the front was surprisingly large, but unless they were given proper clothing they would not be able to support the winter.He stated that stores existed, but this (sic) for some reason or other the Government were taking no steps to supply the troops on the front.This coincides with what Alexeieff told me when he was last here, and I urge that something be done in the way of decided Demarche by the Allies,
