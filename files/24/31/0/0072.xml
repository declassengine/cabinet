r-CoIonel Jones12f Tim Document in the Property ofHis Br\Unn\c Maje*ty&apos;* Government.)SECRETO.A.D. 688.General Headquarters,British Array in the Field.31st. October, 1917.The Chief of theImperial General Staff.In accordance with your instructions issued in pursuance of the decision of His Majesty&apos;s Government to despatch &quot;two divisions to Italy as quickly as possible, all necessary arrangements are being made and the force detailed will proceed as quickly as transport can &quot;be provided.As it appears from ycur telegram No. 44115, of the 28thdoubt, various other Services, I conceive it to be my duty to place before you, for the information of the War Cabinet, my views on the probable effect of such a decision on the campaign on the Western front.In the first place I desire to point out that, subject to the necessary force being left at my disposal, it is my intention to continue the offensive on the Flanders front for several weeks yet.   The situation there, despite the advanced season and the delays caused by bad weather, is still favourable for a considerable and important further measure of success.     From the positions already reached I see no reason to doubt that Passchendaele and the high ground round it will be in our possession by the middle of November, if not sooner, and the ground in question is the most formidable stronghold still left to the enemy on theculated War inet 10.17.instant, that I may be called on to provide four more divisions, with a proportion of heavy artillery and, noridge
&quot; 3332.ridge extending from the south-west through Passchendaele and thence to near Dixmude.The capture of this stronghold should ensure the eventual capture of the remainder of the ridge,, thereby forcing the enemy to evacuate Houthulst Forest.The political, moral and strategical advantages of gaining this ridge have been stated by me in previous memoranda.     I may point out here, however, that tactically possession of the ridge will be of extraordinary value at the opening of next year!s campaign, while as a defensive line for the winter it offers very great advantages, giving us dry trenches, excellent cover in rear of them, and secure flanks .On the other hand, if it should be necessary to abandon any further advance before the ridge has been captured, a portion of our line for the winter on the ?/est of the ridge will be low-lying, waterlogged, and overlooked; difficult to hold against a determined attack, which must be regarded as a possibility especially if the enemy regains the initiative, and expensive in wastage both from the enemy&apos;s fire and from sickness.The loss of the troops already detailed to proceed to Italy will not compel me to abandon my plans on the Flanders front, although it will throw a much greater strain on my resources and involve heavier demands and greater hardships on the troops remaining at my disposal.A decision to send larger forces to Italy, however, will reduce the forces in France below what is required for the continuance of the offensive, and I trust the effects of this will be very thoroughly considered before such a decision is formed.     The value of the ridge in question is so great to the Germans, the fight for it lias become so much a test of their ability to hold their ground against the British Armies, that the abandonment of the attack nowwould
Another.would certainly &quot;be hailed in Germany as a victory, and exploited by our enemies as a British failure.The disappointment to our own troops who have fought so hard to win the ridge is also by no means a negligible factor.In addition to the considerations stated above, the despatch of larger forces to Italy would also involve the abandonment of certain other offensive projects for which arrangements are in hand and to which I attach considerable importance.To provide for his Italian offensive in addition to concentrating in Flanders the large number of troops required to oppose our advance and,possibly, with other objects not yet exposed, the enemy has reduced his defensive forces on a considerable extent of the Western front to a degree which goes far beyond anything he has ventured to risk heretofore.     On many parts ef his front in this theatre he is now bo weak that a surprise attaok on him would meet with but feeble resistance and might be expected to attain results which would force him to abandon his positions in a considerable area and to hurry up reinforce-ments, not only to the front so attacked but to other points similarly exposed.The loss of the troops already detailed for Italy will not deprive me of all power of exploiting this favourable situation, though it will reduce the force available for the purpose and will greatly hamper and delay my preliminary arrangements owing to uhe diversion of rolling stock, etc, required for the movement to Italy.     Any increase in the number of divisions to be detailed for the Italian theatre will almost certainly necessitate the entire abandonment of the plans I had formed to turn the existing situation to good account.
9 Q rro 0 JAnother factor In the problem of further reinforcing Italy is the question of transportation requirements.   The attached memorandum on that point by my Director-General of Transportation explains the matter so fully that I need only add to it that provision of coal for the increased number of locomotives working in   Italy has also to be considered; that any considerable extension of the British front in France this winter would also add considerably to my transportation requirements in this country; and that requests for provision of certain railway material for Egypt have recently been received here from England which cannot be met from the means now at my disposal.   The diversion of rolling stock, etc, for the movement of troops to Italy, and subsequently for their maintenance, will curtail considerably the facilities at my disposal for the rapid movement of troops behind my front for either offensive or defensive purposes.From the foregoing statement of the situation it will be seen that so far as the Western front is concerned the despatch to Italy of larger forces than those now under orders would entail the abandonment of our offensive and with it of the initiative,, leaving the enemy free to utilise the forces at present occupied in resisting our attacks, together with any which he can withdraw from his Eastern front, for such offensive projects- as he may have in contemplation.Whether he would employ these forces in reinforcing his armies in Italy, in attacking Salonika, developing a new lineof advance through Switzerland as the French fear, attempting an offensive on the Western front, or some of the other possibilities open to him, are questions requiring close study but which lie outside the scope of this paper.The point I desire to make clear is that the abandonment of our offensive on this front would leave him free to develop his own plans, while the more we can press him on this front the less power he will have to do so.A
A considerable allied success in Italy vrould doubtless interfere with his plans and if great enough to turn the tablos there might regain the initiative for the allies.     To me, however, it seems that in view of the time required to develop an allied offensive in Italy, and having regard to the unreliability of the Italian army, and the restrictions imposed on the size of the force that can be sent to assist it owing to defensive requirements on the Western front and to transportation difficulties, the prospects of regaining the initiative by an offensive In Italy are too small to base any hopes on.     Meanwhile, if offensive operations on the Western front had to be abandoned such assistance as Italy derives from them would be lost to her.It is improbable that the largest force we could send to Italy would be capable of accomplishing more than stopping the rout there and enabling the Italians to hold on, with French and British help, to some new line of defence.It is possible that even so much might not be acbioved and that our forces would become involved in an Italian &quot;debacle&quot;.In either case the troops sent would be lost to us not only now but next year and we should not have sufficient force left to renew the offensive in the spring.In that case the initiative vrould be entirely lost to the allies until the Americans could, develop sufficient force to regain it - probably not before 1919.Even if things should go well for us In Italy, enabling the French and British troops to be withdrawn again a few months hence, these troops would probably require rest and refitting before being again employed offensively in France, and consequently our offensive next year might be delayed.One more point affecting the Western front requires consideration, viz., defensive requirements.It
It is not impossible that the enemy may attempt an offensive this autumn if our attacks stop and he finds, as he must do, that we have transferred troops to Italy.Our troops have done splendidly, but they are not h-^ghly^ trained, they have undergone great hardships and most severe exertion for several months past, and they have not had the experience of a really intense and prolonged bombardment such as we have subjected the enemy to in our attacks; and which with the help of captured guns the Germans may be able to develop in the future.The resisting power of the French has also to be taken into account; and, especially In view of the curtailment of railway facilities for the rapid move of troops behind our lines, any serious weakening of the allied forces on the Western front would entail risks which cannot be ignored in considering the general problem.To summarise the situationIt is urgently desirable, in the general interests of the allies, to save Italy from the collapse which threatens her.The alternatives open are either to adopt a purely defensive attitude on the Western front and send all the French and British forces that can be spared to reinforce the Italian army, or to assist Italy Indirectly by exerting the greatest possible pressure on the Western front, sending to her only a small force (as already ordered) with the object of restoring confidence and enabling her to rally her own armies.Either of these two courses may succeed and either mayfail; but the consequences of failure in the case of thefirst-stated alternative would almost certainly be far more serious than the failure of the second.Direct reinforcement of Italy to the extent necessary inthe
the first case would weaken the French and us so much that if it failed in saving her the allies might be deprived of all further offensive power until America has been able tc develop her armies.      It is very doubtful whether the pat Jen of the allied nations would stand the test; while the allied armies, deteriorating from a prolonged defensive and perhsps heavily attacked, might prove unequal to the strain.Failure of the alternative method of indirect assistance wou^d be less serious, since it would leave the French and ourselves not only more secure defensively but still capable of offensive action.It is not possible to determine now whether direct assistance or indirect assistance to Italy would prove most effective in saving her from collapse.   But either method may fail and it is beyond doubt that failure in one case would be far more dangerous than in the other and that it would be wiser to risk the loss of Italy from the alliance than to risk the loss of the war.(Sd.)

VERY SECRET. EGO). 3536.I have &quot;been considering the possible effect that the despatch of a portion of the forces, now on the British front, to other theatres of war, may produce from the point of view of Transportation.The position on the British front at the present time is that, with the assistance given to the French Railways in the matter of rolling stock, manned locomotives, and new railways, their resources, which were strictly limited at this time last year, have been so far strengthened as to enable a daily service of, say, 270 to 280 broad gauge trains per day to be run with regularity, as against a service of 160 trains per day run with great difficulty and intermittently during August, 1916.It has occurred to me that the despatch of two Divisions to Italy may be followed by the despatch of other Divisions, and in that connedtion the following possibilities oust be borne in mind.The Italian Railways, under normal conditions, are not equipped with either engines or rolling stock on a strong basis, and are largely dependent upon French, Austrian and German rolling stock worked to and from destinations in Italy. Austrian and German rolling stock is, of course, not now avail-able, and due to trade between France and Italy under war conditions being practically non-existent, and due to the short-age of roiling stock generally in France, there are few Frenoh wagons working into Italy.     The Italians, therefore, must depend upon their own rolling stock for internal traffic in their country.The sudden call to provide engines and rolling stock for a considerable number of additional trains, which will be occasioned by the presence of Allied Armies in Italy, will no doubt, to my mind, cause a serious situation of shortage of
rolling stock in Italy,In the course of the deliberations of the periodical meetings of the Inter-Allied Conference on Transportation in Paris, which meetings I attend as D.G.T.. the Italian representatives have consistently drawn attention to the shortage of wagons In Italy, and continue to press their demands for assistance, for the reason that the Italian Railways are now called upon to work certain traffic for the British Government en the Cherbourg-Taranto Line of Communic-ation.   Hitherto no direct assistance has been given to the Italian Railways in the shape of rolling stock or locomotives, as the French are, in reality, providing the necessary rolling stock for the Cherbourg-Taranto service.   The French have received; and are continuing to receive, assistance from Britain by the importation of British owned wagons, and it is submitted at the Conferences in question that the French are thereby in a position to supply whatever rolling stock is necessary for the Cherbourg-Taranto service.Further demands, however, upon the Italian Railways by the additional traffic, which they will be called upon to work for the Allied Armies, will no doubt immediately result in an urgent.call for assistance in locomotives and rolling stock.The position therefore appears to me that, if the British force is likely to be increased beyond that which is to be despatched under existing arrangements, and if that force is to have its proper service of broad gauge trains, the British Government will have to provide locomotives and rolling stock for its use in Italy,   Knowing the conditions -prevailing in England; and appreciating to its fullest extent the almost insuperable- difficulty of obtaining tonnage, I fear that a demand will be made that British owned locomotives and rolling stock, now a part of my resources in this country,
shall he diverted to Italy,I also would point out that it appears to me likely that demands will be made&quot;for Operating personnel, Workshop and Mechanical personnel etc., all of whom are essential accompaniments of rolling stock and engines if sent to Italy.The supplementing of Italian resources by British locomotives, rolling stock and personnel will, in time, undoubtedly bring forth another demand, namely:-   for the construction of additional railways.   This demand again, to my thinking, will be bound to result in diversion of my resources, both of material and construction troops.Conditions as regards the provision of locomotives, rolling stock and railway material generally, at the present time, are such that the only resources existing in ready form are with the British Armies in Prance, and on that account I anticipate that if the need in Italy suddenly arises, as it appears to me it is bound to do, all eyes will be turned to the British Army in Prance in order to satisfy them.Similarly as regards personnel.     The British Army has, with very great difficulty, concentrated here a consider-able force of skilled railway personnel of all descriptions, and it is no exaggeration to say that there is no reserve in England of that class of skilled men, which can be diverted to Italy.     I anticipate, therefore, on this account also that the fulfilment of any needs for Italy will be expected from the British Army in Prance,The depletion of our resources in Prance can only have one result, viz:** a reduction in the number of trains run for British Army traffic, which, it would appear to me, can only result in our Armies on the Western front suffering reduction in strength and efficiency.The French Railways, on which the British Army is based, although revived by the help and material assistance
alluded to above, have no reserves behind them, and could not undertake the additional burden which would fall upon them if British assistance were withdrawn from France to Italy.(Signed)   P.A.M. Nash.M.G. D.G.T,G.H.Q.29th October,1917.
