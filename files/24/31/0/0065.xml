(This Document in the Property ofHis Britannic Majesty^ Government.)MSMINISTEY  OF  FOOD.//Eeport for Week ending Wednesday, November 7, 1917.Allied Purchases. In a cable to Lord Rhondda thanking him for a message in support of the American Food Conservation campaign, Mr. Hoover expresses the hope that British statesmen will emphasise the necessity for the shipment of the food which has been purchased in the United States, and adds that if the measures necessary to provide supplies for the Allies are to be attained, it is desirable to avoid the publication of optimistic statements which are reproduced in America.The Allied Provisions Export Commission report by cable that they have to submit to Mr. Hoover before the fifteenth of every month a complete programme of the requirements for the Allies for the following three months. Measures have been taken, by the Meat and Fats Executive to provide the necessary estimates. The Commission have also forwarded a statement from Mr. Hoover expressing the view that licences for purchases of ail forms of fat in the United States should not be granted to any of the Allies unless-applied for through the Allied Provisions Export Commission. Mr. Owen Smith and the representatives in New York of the partici-pating Allies have cabled urging that steps should be taken immediately to ensure that no buying in the United States and Canada of articles scheduled under the Meat and Fats agreement should be permitted except through the Export Commission. The Meat and Fats Executive, at a meeting held in London, have approved in principle of Mr. Hoover&apos;s proposal so far as it concerns articles already scheduled, providing it does not come into effect until the Export Commission are in a position financially and otherwise to secure an uninterrupted supply of the commodities affected to the Allied countries.Mr. Owen Smith cables that the total purchases in bacon and ham undertaken by his Mission to the close of business on November 3rd approximated to $27,500,000. There only remained for the purchase of bacon and ham to the end of November, a credit of $700,000. The Mission have been instructed to apply this to the immediate purchase of lard.By arrangement with the Treasury a credit of 82,000,000 has been placed at the disposal of the Mission for the purchase in November of frozen and tinned meats.Both Mr. Hoover and Mr. Hanna deprecate the canning of pork and. beans in North America on the ground that this can be done more economically in the United Kingdom.The Mission had been requested to investigate and report upon the Live Cattle situation; also as to the possibilities of increased supplies from North America of animal fats for margarine, condensed milk, and cheese.By arrangement with the Treasury $3,000,000 has been allocated for the purchase of bacon, hams, and lard in Canada, Mr. Owen Smith has been instructed to purchase up to this amount.On November 6th a cable was received from the Canadian Food Controller, asking that facilities should be provided for shipping Canadian bacon to the United Kingdom and pointing out that unless Canadian packers had an adequate outlet the Canadian Governments campaign for increasing hog. production would be nugatory. Mr. Hanna was informed that a credit of $3,000,000 had just been secured from the Treasury for expenditure in Canada and that Lord Rhondda was sparing no effort to arrange the fullest possible facilities for buying in Canada, but that, so far, the available credits for Canada were limited to $3,000,000.Bacon,. Hams, and Lard. A serious situation has arisen in regard to purchases of bacon and lard in America, in view cf the credits granted by the Treasury proving insufficient to cover absolutely necessary purchases. Strong representations have accordingly been made to the Treasury in the hope that a satisfactory agreement may be reached. -The question of buying Chinese lard has been considered, but it has been decided that considerations of freight render such purchases impossible. The maximumA.   (33)4299-2   Pk 1   70   11/17   E &amp; S APART I.-ACTION  TAKEN.Control of Supplies and Prices.
price of lard has been raised 5s. per cwt., and holders have been instructed to release their stocks gradually in order that a stock may be kept available until new consign-ments can arrive. A maximum Prices Order is in preparation, and will shortly be made.   It has been decided not to issue any Provisional Order on the subject.An agreement has been reached on the question of the Army requisitioning of Danish bacon. A selection will be made in Denmark between sides over 35 lbs. and under 35 lbs., the Army taking the former, and the latter being put on the market to find their natural price.Butter. The Butter (Maximum Prices) Order (No. 5) has been issued securing an approximately flat price for imported and home-produced butter throughout the country. The first-hand maximum price of both Danish and Dutch butter has been fixed at 229s. per cwt. export. This price came into force for Dutch butter on 6th November and for Danish butter it will be in force on and after 13th November. The price of blended butter from English factories has also been fixed, and all classes of butter throughout (Treat Britain should not now cost the&apos; consumer more than from 2s. 3d. to 2s. 5d. per lb.Cheese. The Cheese (Maximum Prices) (No. 2) Order was issued on 31st October, to come into force on 5th November, in substitution for the Cheese (Maximum Prices) Order of 31st August last. The retailers&apos; gross profit is now limited to 2\d. per lb., and the wholesalers&apos; margins of profit have been revised and defined ; a small additional profit of Is. 6tZ. per cwt. is now allowed to the second wholesaler distributing cheese in small quantities to small retail shops. In the case of Caerphilly cheese a dealer is now permitted to add 8s. per cwt. to the first-hand price when selling to a retailer. In order to secure the maturing of whole milk cheese, an additional price of Is. per cwt. will be permitted to holders of cheese for each period of 14 davs during which it is held after 1st December next, provided that such cheese &quot;is indelibly marked with the date of manufacture. Transport charges have also been revised and defined.Cold Storage. Additional cold storage accommodation has been arranged as follows : c. ft,Bristol  -------     600,000   &apos;Glasgow 150,000Liverpool 400,000London -------   1,920,000London - - - - - - - &apos;     40,000London -------     550,000Manchester.

S 3On. a sale to a dealer or maker, miller or importer, the rate is to be 6s. 3d. per ton lower than that mentioned in the schedule appended to the Order, and where only a small amount is delivered in one week to a buyer, the seller may charge sums at specified rates in excess of the maximum ; an addition of 5s. per ton may be made for kibbled cake. Provision is made for the addition of transport charges, but no charge is permitted for bags. The terms allowed are net cash within 14 days of delivery, and interest at 6 per cent, for a longer period. Contracts existing on 1st November are not affected by this Order.Fish. The effort to popularise the consumption of pickled herrings has resulted in a considerable demand for these fish, and about 2,000 barrels are now being sold each week for home consumption.In view of the scarcity of tinplate and its importance for the purpose of canning-fish, the Ministry of Munitions have been asked to release a sufficient quantity to enable the requirements of this industry to be met.Meat. The Pigs (Maximum Prices) Order, 1917, was issued on Cth November, making the sale of live pigs by weight compulsory, and fixing the maximum live weight price at 18s. per score on a parity with the maximum wholesale carcase prices of 9s. 6d. per stone of 8 lbs., excluding offal, or 10s. if the offals are included in the sale. -Accurate records are required to be kept by persons buying live pigs for slaughter. This Order doss not apply to boars or pedigree sows, bought and sold specifically for breeding purposes.A circular letter has been issued to all Food Control Committees pointing out that wholesale prices of beef fell on 1st November, and instructing the Committees to modify their scales of retail prices accordingly. A model scale of maximum retail meat prices has also been issued to all local Food Control Committees in London and the Home Counties.Forms for the census of live stock have been drawn up and will be issued jointly oa behalf of the Board of Agriculture and the Ministry of Food. The purpose of this census, which it is proposed to take on 2nd December, is to ascertain the number and position of the cattle in the country, as a basis for future control of distribution and slaughtering.   The results will be tabulated by the Live Stock Commissioners.Further discussion has taken place between the Board of Agriculture and the Ministry of Food on the possibility of using the Ardrossan route for exporting cattle from Ireland.On 6th November the first meeting of the Central Live Stock Advisory Committee for Scotland was held at Glasgow with Mr. Wise, Assistant Secretary of the Ministry of Food, in the Chair. The organisation for the control of the distribution of cattle in Scotland was discussed, and the methods of limiting the slaughter of breeding animals. Sub-committees were appointed to deal with questions such as grading cf cattle and fixing of live-weight prices, together with rhe arrangements for taking a census of live stock in Scotland. A meeting of the Wholesalers, the United FJeshers, the Retail Fleshers Association, and representatives of the Co-operative Societies was also held at Glasgow at the same date.Oils and Fats. Further steps have been taken towards controlling oil hardening and fat splitting plants throughout the country, and arrangements have been made to control supplies of home melted fats and tallows, in order that there may be no waste of the edible portions which will be allocated to makers of edible compounds and cooking fats only, while non-edible parts will be allocated to the soap makers.Oil Seeds. It has not been possible so far to obtain the freight room for oils and seeds which, as indicated in last week&apos;s report, are necessary for the manufacture of glycerine and margarine.Potatoes.-The number of licences issued to potato growers since September 30, 1917, for the sale of varieties which may not be disposed of without a licence from the Food Controller, is 6,599 and covers a total of 161,272 tons of potatoes. Of this total 143,570 tons were for English and 16,825 tons for Scottish growers. Applications for licences are being received at the rate of about 400 per day.Sugar. No losses have occurred during the week.The details of the agreement for the establishment of. a Sugar Executive have now been settled with the French Authorities, and, subject to the Treasury&apos;s approval of the clause relating to finance, the draft has bgen signed,      -; .
PART II.-SUMMARY OF THE FOOD POSITION.m-l-m Hi ,.  .   :       &apos; :    Imports. . 0.   . jThe aggregate weight of imported principal, foods (including tea and rice) was 13^,000&apos; tons.last, week as compared with 140,000 tons the week before (Table A). W e t;and&apos;, flour, fell 34,000 tons, other cereals (including rice) rose 26,000 tons. Me^t fell back to 11,000 tons after the very large importation in, the previous week. Qfteese fell, off 4,000 ,tons, and practically no margarine arrived and Tittle, butter. Tea again equalled a, week&apos;s normal consumption... 35,700 tons, of sugar arrived.:-l ; &apos; .... ,^^h^&apos;necessary fmanbial8ari?^iigHtn^g b:avB beenvmade - bvyvthe vTreasary-to enable the Commission to take np the sugars placed at its disposal in Holland under the, agreement in regard to the exportable surplus of f commodities in that country.-PPea-y-Negotiations have been started with tea planters in India-and Ceylon in order,to expedite tlie;,arrang^toents&apos;:;lto: the^purch^e,pf&apos;;teaaon behalf of the Food Controller./&apos;&quot;&apos; \.mSr^rM\  .ia&amp;i  - --0&apos;-&apos;A Press Notice has been issued to the effect that&apos;it should &quot;be possible to sell before the 31st December stocks of previously uncontrolled tea existing in the United Kingdom, and that it should be possible after that date to reduce further the maximum price.   Sufficient warning has thus been given to the trade.The Irish Food Control Committee has stated that there is no special reason to vary in thePase of Ireland the maximum price of 4s. per lb.- Enforcement of Orders.-Hoarding of Food.-At Ryde, on 30th October, Lady Dring was fined 10L for hoarding a cask of table syrup weighing over 5 cwt. Under Regulation 58 of the Defence of the Realm Regulations the goods were also confiscated, and the Chief Constable is selling the syrup at auction and crediting the money to the County Fund. This, provision as to the forfeiting of goods had not been previously utilised. At Plymouth, on the 5th instant, an Army canteen waiter -was lined 2ol. for hoarding 58 lbs. of sugar and 26 lbs. of tea.Potatoes. At Spalding, on the 6th instant, L. Woolf and Son, of Covent Garden, were fined 200L for purchasing seed potatoes above the maximum price. Under the Potato Orders the buyer is liable to the same penalty as the seller, but in previous cases only the seller had been prosecuted. .Wheat, Rye, and Rice (Restriction) Order. The Chief Constable of Exeter reports that a man called Hooper was fined hi. 4s. at Chulmleigh for allowing his ricks of wheat to become damaged. Several complaints have been received that farmers are feeding their pigs with flour, and an inspector has been detailed to make inquiries in one case in Essex. The Wheat Commission have requested that stringent measures should be taken to stop the practice. It is, however, difficult to obtain proof. At St. Helens, on the 5th instant, a man -was fined 151. for using wheat for horse and poultry food ; and at Keighley, on the 6th instant, a miller was fined 20Z. for abetment of the. use of wheat for feeding fowls by a farmer. The farmer himself was let off with a fine of 21.Milk.-At Newport, in the Isle of Wight, 3 milk retailers were fined 101. each for charging excess prices, and at the Inverness Sheriff Court, on the 2nd instant, a Dairy Farmers&apos; Cpmpany was fined 10Z. for a similar offence. - Cases under the old Price of Milk Orders continue to come before the Courts. At Lexden and Winstree Petty Sessions, on, the 4th instant, a milk purveyor was fined hi. for selling milk at an excessive price, and another milk seller was fined 10Z. lor a similar offence.^Miscellaneous. Under the Jam (Prices) Order, a grocer wras fined 101. on the 30th October at the Gateshead Police Court, and at St. Helens on the 29th October, another grocer was fined hi., in both cases for charging excessive prices.Under the Sugar (Registration of Retailers) Order, at the Cleveland Police Court on the 6th instant, an ice-cream manufacturer and a grocer were each fined in the sum of 40Z. for submitting false returns of their sugar.
The general low level of imports in recent weeks is&apos; shown in the following table:-Thousand Tons. .Wheat and j    Flour.		Oats, Barley; and Maize.	Beef and Mutton.	Bacon, Hams, and Lard.

In the Central Market London, and in the markets of Manchester. Glasgow, and Liverpool, the supply of home-fed meat in the week ended October 27th was 9 per cent, above the previous week and 6 percent, above the corresponding week last year (Table B). In the same week the supply of foreign meat was only 46 per cent, of that in the corresponding week last year. Taking home and foreign meat together, we find that the supply was 6 per cent, above the previous week, but 18 per cent, below last year.In the month of October the average weekly supplies of fat cattle, sheep, and pigs in 59 markets in Great Britain (Table C) were respectively 8, 6 and 16 per cent, above the average in September this year, but in the ease of sheep and of pigs this only meant a return to the August level. Compared with October of..last year fat cattle show an increase of 7 per cent, and fat sheep 14-g- per cent., while fat pigs show a fall of 33 per cent. The index numbers for October (Table E.) indicate that the consumption of home-fed meat in October was higher than in any month since May 1916,7 per cent, above September 1917, and 5 per cent.&apos;above October 1916. These assume that the weight per carcase is the same this year as last. On the other hand the consumption of foreign meat is very much less than last year, and the combined index number shows a fall from October last year of nearly 13 per cent. ; but whereas last year the consumption in October equalled that in September, this year it is 3^ per cent, greater,.    &apos; :; :     Wholesale Prices.Cotton seed cake has risen 5s, to 335s., the highest price recorded, and palm kernel cake 10s..to 312s. 6cZ..  .. ........Retail Prices. .The prices of British meat, which had fallen Id. or 2d. a lb. during September, have fallen another \d. or \d. during October ; the whole fall since the fixing of the maximum price averages about 2d. per lb. Bread and flour are practically unchanged in price since October 1st. Bacon has risen 8 per cent., and/this, combined with increases in-the/price iof potatoes,- tea, milk, butter,. and eggs, raises the general index number to 4 per cent, above that of last month and 106 above the standard. Since, however, this method of measurement is on the hypothesis of a budget whose quantities are unchanged since pre-war times, stress should not be laid on thea  4299-2 &apos; p
apparent increase in the month;, for-example, if; eggs.^arevomitted,, -margarine substituted for&apos; butter,&apos; and British meat for lef^i^^^f^iid-pa^e&amp;^me increase in the month ^ould be 1 per cent., the fall since September 1st would be 6 per cent, and the increase since July 1914; 8o.per cent/:   ; .:.   -b ; \rJ       ;Table A.
