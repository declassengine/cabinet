(11th November) 3rd Army no change.4th Army.    9th Corps has taken over front from Monte TOMBA to NERVES A.   2nd. Army Corps has been withdrawn to reform.   34 battalions forming the 9th Corps have only 14,000 bayonets and about 350 machine guns.   Bridge at VID0R blown up to-day but two leads only were applied and one failed.    Consequently there is only a breach in the bridge of 15 metres on the near side.   Attempt is to be made tonight to explode the other charge Rnd complete destruction of bridge. Enemy has been bombarding this section of the front fairly sharply during the day but without causing much damage,    18th Corps is completing its movement on to Monte GRAPA,    1st Army Corps has completed its movement under rather difficult conditions and the 26th Division is also marching in,Field Artillery of the :;th Army has been reinforced by about 35 Field Batteries bringing the number of field guns of the Army up to nbout 300 rhich v-ith 400 medium and heavy guns makes a total of about 700 guns vith 4th Army,1st Army no change,   20th Corps is completing its movement to link up with left flank of 4th Army,   There was a small engagement near TEZZE on the SUGANA Valley when the onemy while pressing on troops of tho 20th Co %ps in movement was sharply repulsed, 3rd Army Corps,     No change.The French troops are continuing their concentration towards BRESCIA ^ncl 3 divisions trill move at once by road and by rail to VERONA and towards VICENZA,British Forces.   First of the troops arrived MANTUA last night and six detachments of one officer and six men each are beins sent to front.of
of the 3rd and 4th Armies to move about amongst Italian troops and show that British roinforcemonts are arriving. Similar measure Is being taken by the French.Enemy has shown little aggressive tendency at any point on the front to-day.    21st Austrian division has been located on ASIAGO plateau end the presence of the 11th Austrian division is also suspected.    It appears probable that the enemy will carry out wide turning movement, by the north, but direction of his attack is uncertain. Contact on the PIAVE front has been lost with two or throe German and Austrian divisions and it is possible they arc, with others, engaged on this movement,    Morale of Italian troops certainly seems to be improving, Discipline on the roads is better and columns of the remnants of the BERSAGLIERI Division, of the 20th and 33rd Divisions and of the 27th, 24th and 2nd Army Corps withdrawing from front presented a creditable appearance to-day.    The Officers state that a couple of days1  rest and sufficient supply of drafts is all that is needed to give the units their full efficiency again.    Troops in their now positions are very short of barbed wire and their defences are very niddjncrrteury.. Successive lines of trenches in the present positions are at prosent -entirely lacking.    Orders for selection of successive positions and of independent roads back for separate units had not reached Corps Commands at 5 p.m. to-day.    Their bridge over the SILE had been completed however.Weather is cloudy and wet.    Good deal of snow has fallen on the high ground and on Monte GRAPA comes down to the 3,000 foot level.
