(This-Document to th* Property ofGolonel JoW17His Britannic Matjeaty^ Government.)216o.l/B.E.F.4/4.Copy of a report received by the General Staff, War Office, on 8th November, 1917, from the General Staff,G.H.QFrance *WEATHER CONDITIONS FOR RAIDING IN SOUTHERN GERMANY.1.The following is extracted from a report by the CONo. 3 Wingi R.N.A.S. at Ochey, dated 24th May, 1917, concerning weather conditions in Southern Germany in the winter 1916 - 1917:-The woather became considerably worse and from the ond of October until early in February there were very fow days on which it was possible to carry out raids and these only with considerable difficulty.    Heavy fogs were constantly encountered and the valleys in which the German iron works and factories are situated were generally hidden in mist.Notwithstanding these conditions, 6 raids were successfully carried out during this period.During February the weather cleared considerably and on four days it was fine and clear.     The temperature, however, was very low and it was possible to carry out only one raid in this month.     The hangars at Ochey were not heated and the cold was so intenso that even the oil in the Clerget engines froze.    Every device was used to keep the machines sufficiently warm for fly-ing, but it was found impossible to keep more than a very few ready at one time.At the end of February the weather bocame milder, but unfortunately fog and mist increased over the objectives so much that the pilots had to return from raids without dropping their bombs.    Attempts were also made to set out on raids,but
but owing to tho weather conditions the machines were forced to return without crossing the lines.    On all days when the weather was sufficiently good for flying, but when raiding was impossible, all machines available were practised in formation flying and bomb dropping.2.        The following report was made by the Chef de Bataillon Lefort Commandant l*Escadrille C.E.P. 115 dated 3rd May, 1917, concerning weather conditions in Southern Germany in the winter 1916 - 1917:-11 Please find herewith the list of night operations carried out by the C.E.P. 115 Squadron between the 15th October, 1916, and the 24th March, 1917.The bad weather, the low temperature, the mists of the Woevre and of Lorraine account for the diminished number of night raids.In spite of the intense cold which prevailed in February, raiding was rendered possible by taking the following precautions ; (heating of the oil and water of radiators, etc).    The pilots themselves were furnished with gloves and footwear warmed by electricity.&quot;The N,E. wind brings a considerable amount of mist which only disappears when the winds attain a velocity of 15 to 20 metres; only the North winds and sometimes N.W. are favourable.     In the Lorraine region throughout the winter it is only on the rarest occasions that flying can be successfully carried out.      The most favourable period for raiding extends between the month of May and the end of September.(Signed).   P. Heycock,n . , Lieut.-Colonel.C.A.I.D.19,10,17.
