His Britannic Majesty^ povef^y^rmtm i&quot; the gym aw was oxsim.-^^^etter to Lord Robert Cecil from Mr. W.L.Hichense3, Central Buildings, Westminster,-LdNDON, 1.12th November, 1917.My Lord:-It seems reasonable to Suppose that the presence of the American Mission under Colonel House will offera convenient opportunity for discussing the question of the joint control, of Neutral tonnage after the war.The Committee appointed by you to deal with this subject has already issued a report recommending that joint action by the Allies and the United States of America is desirable and I would venture to urge that if the most effective action is to be taken the co-operation of the United States Government is of paramount importance.If this view is accepted it will be clear that advantage should be taken of the presence of tho American Mission to determine the lines on which joint action shall proceed.The general principle that joint action is desirable seems to me too obvious to need elaboration, but the precise method in which it is to be carried out presents considerable difficulties, and I am afraid that unless the problem is handled with resourcatiu vigour theymay
mav prove insuperable,At present, as it seems to me, the responsibility ;vr handling this important question has no definite focus.   The Foreign Office, the Ministry of Shipping, the Admiralty, the Board of Trade, the Ministry of Reconstruction and the Treasury are all concerned in the question and they regard it -naturally from different, points oi view.   None of these Departments is responsible for pressing the matter forward and I am unable to ascertain that trie initiative rest$3 on the shoulders of any cae individual.   It is, I suggest, oi vital importance if the most effective scheme of cooperation is to be brought int-o^ effect that someone of Ministerial rank should be given the sole responsibility for con-uing the negotiations and for working out the details of a sound organization&apos;for joint action,I am writing to you because the Committee on neutral tonnage after the war of.which I am Chairman was appointed by you.   But, if you think fit, 1 should bo glad if this letter - or its purport - might be forwarded to the CabinetOur Committee can only make recommendations which perambulate . around half - a-dozen Departments and it is hopeless to expect prompt action&quot; sa-^uirx tc expoct cm/,   But decisive and preqpt act ion is - needed otherwise I. foresee that the Germans who are already in the fs ^ 1 will.. out-maiioeuvre u.s..I have the honour to be, My Lord, Your obedient Servant, (Signed) , W-.L.Hlchsns0
