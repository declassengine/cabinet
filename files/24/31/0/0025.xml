REPORT ON BOMB RAIDS CARRIED OUT DURING THE DAY1st   November   1917.(Report No. 3.)- o- o-o- o- o- o-Two formations of 6 De Havilland 4s each started between 11,30 a.m. and 12 noon to attack the Factories on the Southern outskirts of Kaiserslautern.The first formation to leave crossed the Line East of Chateau !Salines and proceeded to the objective via Bitech and Pirmasens.    Weather conditions were good as far as PIrmasens, but after that became very cloudy, and it was only with difficul-ty that the objective could be found.    Kaiserslautern was only seen through a small hole In the clouds, and three 230-lb, and six 112-lb, bombs were dropped.     Owing to the clouds no actual bursts were observed, but the bombs undoubtedly fell well Into the Town.     The moral effect should be good as the 1st November was a F&amp;te Day, and a general holiday.A good many photographs were taken over the objective, but owing to thick clouds were not successful.The return was without Incident.     All machines re-crossed-the line together, and five reached Ochey Aerodrome.     The sixth machine got lost in the clouds soon after re-crossing, and landed safely at a French Aerodrome near Lure.One E.A. Scout was seen in the distance from Dieuze on the outward journey.Anti-aircraft Defences at the objective were not vigorous as In all probability the bombing machines were not seen, and only a few rounds were fired up through the clouds.Machines on this Raid were in the air for four hours.The second formation of 6 machines did not reach its object-ive.     When about 10 miles over the line in the direction of Bensdorf the leader and one other machine were forced to fall out of the formation owing to engine trouble.     The leader, however, rejoined.
Later 7 E.A. Scouts were encountered, and theformation became split up in the course cf the fighting. The E.A. as far as could be ascertained consisted of 5 Albatross D.1 type and 2 Albatross D.5 type.     One E.A. Scout was shot down and destroyed - first one wing came off and then the other, and the remainder of the machine disintegrated.     During the fighting five pilots released their bombs in the open country in order that they might bebetter able to manoeuvre.     The majority of these bombs fell in the Lakes and Woods near Dieuze.A total of 1,268 rounds were fired during thisengagement.All 6 machines returned safely to their ownAerodrome.(sd), O.L.N,Newall2nd November,1917.In the Field.Lieut,-Colonel, Commanding 41st Wing, Rayal Flying Corps.
