(This Document m t&apos;m Property ofHte Britannic Pajefty^ Government.)^\\. Intelligence Bureau,Department of Information. Z&amp;lwAJ GNW/OClR^ORT   OH   NORWAY. I.(Nov. 5th,  1917)The attitude of the country.Hr. Konow, the leader of the Independent Left party and onethe ablest statesmen in Norway, spoke on the war and the attitude ofhis country tcwards it.     He adversely criticised the views of thosewho wished for rceaoe at any price and expressed the ooiniin that ifwas this very idea v/hich might involve the country in hostilities.He denounced the weakness of the Government and the Starting, theoformer especially because at the Outbreak of the war they had njt undertaken full control and responsibility to the British Government in the question of guaranteeing that Norway did n^t export to Germany goods imported from England.     He als? criticised their food policy. He urged the formation of a non-oarty Government as the only remedy in the existing -perilous circumstances.Herr Konow&apos;s speech was stigmatised by the Government organ, the &quot;Novske Intelligenssedler&quot; as activist in tendency and his proposal that a Coalition Government should be formed is not looked on with favour by the Socialists.The Aaland Islands Question.The military editor of the Tideus Tegn, commenting (Oct. 22) onthe German operations at Oesel and Dago discusses the Aaland Islandquestion in which he says that Noway is interested.     In 1914 ontherethe outbreak of war he states that/were no Russian military forces in the Aaland Islands and that such Russian men-of-war as were sto-tioned in the adjacent waters -rere transfered elsewhere.     The German
199naval forces did not visit the islands until 1915 when they attacked and silenced the coast batteries.     The Russians, thereuponestab-lished a naval base there and constructed fortifications.     This step created uneasiness at Stockholm and the Russian Minister at the Swedish Court was instructed to explain that the fortifications were not of a permanent character and that Russia would abandon them after the war.     Since the recent events in the Baltic, the Scandinavian kingdoms feel that the Aaland Island question may change in character. Earlier in the war when the Swedish activists were more powerful, the operations at Oesel end Dago might have induced the Swedish Government to/join with Germany in an attack tin Finland.     The Swedish activists received, however, a severe blow at the recent election, and it   may be assumed that if Germany decides to occupy the Aaland Islands and invade Finland it will be without aid from Sweden.From the pro-German Swedish Press it   is clear that the seizure cf Oesel and Dago by Germany has aroused new desires in activist circles.     The latter now hope for a Baltic in whioh Germany backed by Finland is supreme, and as th^ir share desire to occupy the Aaland Islands.     They suggest that the.&amp;ooupation of that arohipelago by Sweden might be convenient both to Russia and Germany and that both -Powers may probably offer them to Sweden.     If that offer is not made it is clear that the ectivists hope to induce the Swedish Government to trkc dinlomctic Lotion to secure the Islands end thus hum, to involve Sweden in active neutrality on the side of the Central Powers. While the present Liberal-Socialist Coalition is in po&quot;-er in Sweden, these hopes seem doomed to disappointment.Apprehensions in Norway in regard to American Exports. Commenting on the official statement recently issued by the U.3. Embassy in London the &quot;Norske Intelligenssedler&quot; (Oct. 23), a
110Government organ, says that the Norwegian Government is doing all that is possible to arrive at an agreement with America.     The solu-tion of the matter depends on America which is holding up Norwegian cargoes.     Norway has a right to expect that Amerioa will realise the desperate position of affairs if these cargoes are not released at an early date.     The fishing industry is threatened with destruction from lack of oil and for the same reason other industries are similarly affiected.Destruction of the neutral merchant ships on Oct. 17 in the North Sea.The Norwegian Press does not conceal its indignation regarding thecot cf the German cruisers in sinking nine neutral merohant vessels.The incident is characterised as savage, revolting murder.   Nearlyoutall the newspapers point/that German spies in Norway wore informed of the hour of the departure of the ships and the weakness of the convoy.It is clear that public opinion in Norway has become almost solidly hostile to Germany.     On Nov. 1, the Norwegian Minister at Berlin addressed a Note to the German Government drawing attention to the North Sea outrage of Oct. 17 last.     The Note, after stating the facts of the case, recalls the Memorandum, sent to the Imperial Government on Oct. 20 of last year, in which it was pointed out that the Norwegian nation considered in the light of a violation of the laws of humanity each fresh oase in which the lives of Norwegian sea-men were sacrificed or exposed to danger.     In that Memo.the Norwegian Government had once again requested the Imperial Government to take measures to prevent the Commanders of German submarines im-perilling the lives of Norwegian sailors, whether by negligence or errors of judgement.     The Note emphasises the profound impression made on the Norwegian pimple b;y the fact that not only have German
ubmarines continued to sink peaceable merchant vessels, paying no egard to the fate of their crews, but that even German War-ships have dopted the same methods.In connection with the North Se-fi incident Dr. Amundsen and Captain fit to Sverdrup, the famous exnlorers, have returned to the German Minister [their German decorations as a protest against the outrages committed by the German Fleet on Borwegian seamen.In spite of the strong feeling against Germany existing all thraugh the country there does not seem much probability at present of Norway entering the war.     Quite recently, Oct. 30, the Storting decided by a Iconsiderable majority that the armed forces of Norway must not be used [for attack.Heavy fall in shipping shares.According to the &quot;Norske Intelligenssedler&quot; there was, on Oct. 9, a heavy fall in shipping shares which appears to have come without warning.     The principal reason is stated to be that shares have been forced up to very high prices and that some holders are realising. Another reason may be the steadily growing rumours of an early peace. Such rumours have an effect on the market even when devoid of any solid basis.     A further reason may be heavy speculation in Danish Netherlands shipping shares.     Last year about this time there was a similar fall in Norway.Incendiary fires in Norway and espionage.During the late summer and autumn there have been a considerable number of mysterious fires, one of them being an attempt on the great Government arms factory in Kongsberg.     In nearly all these cases there is no doubt whatever of criminal intent.     Investigations are in progress but some of the Norwegian papers are disposed to think   that
the evidence points to an organised   German conspiracy.     A certain OountxSeipio del Campo, of German origin has been arrested on the oharge of sending diagrams from the Raufos cartridge factory to various addresses in Sweden and Austria.     As bail up to  8000 was offered and refused it would appear that the evidence against him is serious. *Fat scarcity in Norway.The Government have prohibited the   sale of fat and oil both animal and vegitable, including fish oils.     The State will have, till further notioe, a monopoly of these articles and will retail them for home Oonsumption ond foreign trnde.A new method has been discovered for refining wh le-oil to be U3ed ifi the manufacture of margrrine;
