Colonel JonesS DOCmmT^THE PROPERTY OF KIS BRtTAHNIC MAJESTY1S GOVERKMidJTlL.343SJC C RE; T...n m   owl, WAR CABIXET.TO 0? IRISH EXECUTIVE Memorandum by Chief Secretary for Ireland.I desire to have the authority of the War Cabinet for tv;o decisions in respect of Irish Administration which appears to me to be necessary:- one the setting   up of a Commission or Committee to investigate certain grievances of the teachers in IrishElementary schools; the other the taking of steps to place Ireland on the same footing as England in respect of povers for the feeding of necessitous school children, by combined funds dra.wn half from local rates and half fron a Treasury grant.(I)   Educational Troubles.Irish Elementary Education,   so far as it is subject to any public control, is under the control of the National Board cf Education, a composite body with its headquarters in Dublin constituted with a view to the representation and cancellation of the religious differences which underlie most of the political difficulties of the country.   At the head of the &quot;Board is the li $it Honourable Dr. Starkie, who has held the office of Resident Comissioner for ??.. great part of 20 years - who appears to enjoy the confidence of.the represen-tatives of faiths and sects who constitute the Board, but who Beuan     to be regarced by the great body of Irish teachers as an enemy.   Membership of the Board includes Bishops,  Clergymen, Ministers and laymen,  all of undoubted position, but for the most part selected with a view&apos;to the representation cf sectarian influence and the avoidance of open religious feuds.   The Board sits in Dublin periodically and exercises its control by the $rant or refusal of funds for education which are paid to the managers of the schools throughout the country and which are paid or withheld upon consideration of the reports of a staff of inspectors whose judgment of educational results is founded upon the application of a code of rules issued with govefmental sanction and from time to ti:ae supplemented by new rules, some of which in their turn receive and, I believe,  require the authorisation of the Executive Government, while some are issued at the discretion of the Board.   The &quot;fundamental rules&quot; which are reserved for the sanction of the Execu-tive are I believe chiefly those relating to sectarian con-side rat ions .There are in Ireland 7,S00 schools where elementary education is given under the auspices of the National Board. Besides these schools there exist a considerable body of schools conducted by the Christian Brothers ( a very&apos; famous teaching fraternity, to whom Ireland has owed much in the way of education) and large numbers of schools conducted by monks and nuns.    Of the elementary schools,  which exist
under the direct sanction of the Board, a vast proportion /re schools where the number of children taupcht may be as low as 7  and in the laryge majority of cases is not as great as 50.   There are in tho&apos; larger towns schools with hundreds of pupils, but a main difficulty in making proper provision for&quot; the Irish teacher is the fact that, in the majority of cases, he or she will be found teething a school which can hardly be regarded as an economic unit*In the national schools the appointment of the teachers rests with the manager,   Usually lie is either the parish priest, or tho protestant parson, or the nonconformist minister, according to v/hether the school has been established for Roman Catholic children, for the children of Episcopalians or for the children of Nonconformists0   The manager is represented to me as having something of the nature of a proprietary interest and control in the school and an almost absolute authority over the teacher,   Neither the manager nor the parents axe accustomed, however, to ropxird education as throwing any pecuniary burden upon them-   To may be that for the purpose of compliance *7itli regulations of the Board as to the condition of promises, some-slight local effort will be made from time to time for the provision of exiguous supplies of money, but in &apos;Ji- general way the school has to be carried on with the resources provided to the monr/ror out of money    -voted by Parliament and I have been told that in many cases teaoners are compelled, in order to keen their livelihood   to expend their&apos; own money in the provision of books, stationery, and school requisites.The (Treat outstanding difference betvroe:i the Irish system 01 elementary education and that of England is that, whereas the English system is a local system supported by local rates with the nelp of generous grants from the -schequer, the Irish system is in its essence a national system, but its maintenance is stinted, and its efficiency snockingly impaired by limiting the expenditure male upon it to ioxenequer grants proportionate to those made from the exchequer to&quot; the hnqlish schools - irrespective- cf the fact, that the policy of the legi slature has resulted in the abolition of school fees and has prevented or not -provided any system of payment from local lands toward this public service. tThe direct effect of this state of things is that the salaries of Irish teachers arc lower than the salaries of Miglish and Scotch teachers to the extent nracticailv of tne difference caused by the absence in Ireland cf aid from tne rates.. To appreciate the difficulties and hardships of the Irisn system one must bear in mind the methods whereby the teacher is qualified to tea.cn, the opportunities which are open to him of employment, and the restrictions ahich exist bo limit his chances of advancement,   Irish elementary teacners proceed from the rank of nupil to that of certificated master or mistress in&quot;-fiat. I believe, is much tue^same fashion as in England.   Klng&apos;s scholarships admit oo braining colleges.   There is the familiar routine of apprenticeship, examination  attendance at college   and certification,   Then comes the question of employment, and
3-345the teacher is confronted with the fact that the schools of Ireland are graded with rigorous certainty in a series-of classes dependent primarily upon the number of the pupils, and that, however well qualified the teacher, his chance of profitable and progressive work depends upon his accepta-bility to one of the managers of the schools proviaeu for children of the religious community of which he happens to be a member.   The teacher who becomes master of a school of 30 pupils may find it impossible ever to get promotion.    The teacher who becomes an assistant in either a large cr small school may find it impossible ever tc pass beyond the lower grades of the service tc which teachers of the class in which he finds himself are restricted, This ti :;ic classification seems to be inevitable for the purpose of limiting expendi-ture from national funds in something like an economic re-lation to the work of education tc be dene in the various classes of schools, but it reduces the profession of teaching in Ireland to a series of blind alleys in which a capable teacher becomes infuriated when in middle life he finds that his abilities and his training are not likely to produce for him during the rest of his career anything but indigence and disabiliXy.The circumstances I have indicated above and a variety of minor troubles into which I will nut. now enter have pro-due ed among.the teachers in Ireland conditions of grave discontent verging upon disaffection.    The efforts I have made lately to miti *ate this trouble by the distribution of what is called &quot;the Equivalent Grant&quot; have brought matters to something like a crisis.   Large bodies cf the teachers are seriously contemplating withdrawal from their work.     Such a course would be disastrous to them.   It would also be a public misfortune and a token of adminis-trative failure.    I think it necessary to appoint a Commission or Committee of men well versed in the problems of education and broad-minded with regard to social and political questions, with powers to consider and advise on the   amendment of a system which cannot under present conditions produce satisfactcry results.I have discussed these matters in a general way with the Minister of Education who shares my view that there is a duty in the State to find some remedy for the causes of inefficiency and discontent to which I have referrea and the Minister was so good, as to send me the annexed memor-andum.
Board of Education, Whitehall,London, S.W. 1.9th IT^vember,  1917.My dear Chief Secretary,.I am very glad to learn that you are turning over in your mind the appointment of a Commission or a Committee for the purpose of making recommendations with respect to the System of Education in Ireland.quite apart from the fact that large Educational projects are being entertained in England and Scotland, it appears to me that there is an overwhelming case for overhauling in a thorough and comprehensive manner the System of Public Education in Irelandi   The Memorandum, with which you have been good enough to furnish me, depicts a situation which would be ludicrous if it were not tragic.    There is no regular system of local con-tributiona in aid of Education, no adjustment of the Treasury Grant to Irish conditions, and no real public control over the Teaching Profession.    The Schools are starved,  the teachers live on beggarly salaries;  while the System is sapped of the life which comes from local contributions of money, activity, and interest and betrays in a concentrated form the worst effects of Denominationalism.   I cannot imagine anything worse for Education than the rigid classification of teachers which seems to prevail in Ireland, unless it be the subjection of the Teacher to the Manager cf the Schools It is clear that,the Iri3h System of Education demands a complete recasting in the li :ht of the requirements if-a modern civilised State.   At present every circum-stance in the Irish System appears to be expressly calculated to paralyse educational progress.   The Country gets none of the advantageous dynamic effects out of the Treasury Grant which are obtained by our Educational Authorities in England,  seeing that the grant is stereotyped, has no reference to educational efficiency or inefficiency, and no po&apos;&apos;er tc promote and stimulate effort.    The teacher appears to have very little incentive to improve himself seeing that his remuneration is fixed not in relation to hi3 ability or industry but solely with reference to the number of children in his School.   And meantime the economic organisation of the different grades and types of Education in the Island is paralysed by the continued existence of a large number of smell and markedly inefficient Schools v-hich, I presume, are preserved in the proprietor?/- interests of the Managers and against the public interests of the State.There is certainly material enough here for inquiry and reform and I should be disposed to think that, upon grounds of policy, it v-ould be desirable for the Government to indicate at an early date its interest in this question.   The only point of doubt which occurs to my mine is ^hetVjer an announcement should be postponed until the Report of the Irish Convention has been received.Yours sincerely,(Sd*)   H. A. X. FISHER.Hon.Duke, K.C., M.P.
Prompt action will probably be necessary to stave off aotiv^. public demonstration by tin Elementary teachers. They contrast existing salaries with salaries in England and in Scotland, in terms which satisfy the Irish public that they labour under rt.-.1 disadvantag- s and undoubtedly an adverse differentiation of 30 tc 50% in rates of renumcra-tion and a career in the public service which can only accidentally givt. an educated man a dt Cv.nt provision in life are solid facts capable of endless use for agitation.   I expect shortly to have to make a statement in the House of Commons as to the use to which the &quot;Equivalent Grant&quot; is being put and I hope that if I am able to announce an intended full Inquiry into the case of the Tcachtr3 it -111 produce temporary quiet and open the way to necessary permanent improvement.(II)    School Childrcns&apos; Meals.The provision of me-.ls in Elementary Schools for necessitous school children is providee for in England by Acts of parliament which enable tht local authorities to raise and expond the necessary rates for the purpose, and half the expenditure is recouped from the Treasury.   The coBt to the Exchequer last year was I believe about  85,000.In Ireland there is po*-&quot;er in the local authorities tc levy for these purposes a rate limitod to Id in the   per annum, and no contributory grant is made out of the Exchequer.   I have looked in vain for a satisfactroy cxplana-tion of the differential treatment of the live cases.   In Dublin school children have had to be fed on a considerable scale all through this year to avert starvation among them. The Corporation has raised its Id rate and expended it.   At present meals are being provided partly by charitable persons and partly vdth moneys I have begged from the Committee of the Prince of Wales&apos; Fund.    These resources will presently be exhausted.   The Dublin members rlth the support of the Corporation are pressing me to introduce a Bill to put the Irish system on the same footing as the English, and I th^nk it ought to be done.   I have discussed the matter with Sir Henry Robinson,  vice president of the Local Government Board, who thinks the desired action is proper and would be wise.   The resultant cost is not likely to be great.   The total expenditure in Dublin this.year has I think not reached  10,000, including contributions from outside, and so far as I am av/are the grave necessity is limited to Dublin.   I ask for authority to introduce such a Bill if I fine that it. vill be non-contentious as I believe will be the case.(Sd,) H-. E. DUKE.November,10th, 1917.
