pension frem soldiers have been dealt with or an average of 8,961 por month.   Up to the introduction in April of tho new Warrant which provides gratuities in non-attributablo and slight cases, there had been 66,673 rejections of claims or an average of 2,084 per month.     Since then there have been 657 or an average of 94 a month.    The total number of claims previously rejected which had been dealt with up to the end of October was 12,611 cf which 1,231 were met by the award of pension and 11,380 by gratuities.The growth of the work at Chelsea since the commencement of the year is shown further by the figures in Appendix IV.4, Pensions to Widows and Dependants. The work of awardingPensionsand authorising payment of Widows and Dependants/in current cases is completely up to date.592 re-assessments of dependants pensions were made during the week against 1,248 last week and 1,097 the week before.   There remain 365 oases to be dealt with.   The documents necessary for dealing with these - referred to in last week&apos;s report as outstanding - have now been obtained from the War Office and early settlement will be effected. Appendix V.   The 592 cases this week include 62 dependants pensioned under the old Warrant who have benefitted by the re-assessment to the average extent of 5/4d a week, and 313 dependant parents whose cases had been settled by a gratuity under the old Warrant but have now been placed on pension at an average rate of 8/4d a week.   The rest of the 592 receive no benefit, their pensions already being equal to*&apos;pre-war dependence.No widow or dependant cases have been re-examined as to entitlement under the new Warrant this week, but only three cases remain for decision.

In 750 of these cases Local Committees have been asked to investigate the facts as to income etc, upon which the grant of pension will depend.   In 20 cases reports have been returned and pension will be issued at an early date,   A circular (Ho .27) has gone out tomLocal- Committees pointing out the necessity for promptitude in sending in their reports.6.

Special Medical Board - Number of Awards etc.   A summary of the number of neurasthenic cases examined and pensions etc., awarded or recommended by Colonel Sir John Collie&apos;s Special Medical Board will be found in Appendix VIII.Gratuities
Gratuities granted by this Beard are now for the most part paid by way of Temporary Allowance instead of inlump sume* This practice conforms with the general policy adopted by the Ministry.The activities of the Special Medical Board, which have lately been confined as regards re-examination to the London Area, are being extended to the provinces, but the scheme for obtaining civilian medical officers for this purpose is for the moment suspended pending discussion with the National Service Department as regards the supply of doctors.8. Retired Pay of Army Officers etc The following is a summary of the progress made in the review of cases under the Officers Warrant of the 1st August, 1917.Officers.

Procedure for payment of Pension and Allowances during treatment and training.In tho Instructions for treatment and training issued by the Ministry, it is the practice of Local Committees whore a man is granted&apos;either treatment or training, to withdraw the Identity Certificate or &quot;Ring-Paper&quot; Dy means of which he ordinarily cashes his weekly pension, and to pay him insubstitution
substitution for the pension an allowance at the rate of a minimum pension appropriate to the highest degree of disablement. On the conclusion of the course of treatment or training, the &quot;Ring-Paper&quot; should be returned to the man to enable him to resume his pension.   Complaints have been reoeived from many-quarters that difficulty and delay occur in resuming payment of the pension.   This is mainly due to the fact that in cases of treatment it is not always possible to say at what date treatment will cease, and in consequence the man may leave the Institution without prior notification to his Local Committee or to the Ministry.   To obviate this difficulty, it has been considered best that Looal Committees themselves should be required at the conclusion of treatment or training to make payment to the man of his pension for the brief period if any, pending the furnishing of a further &quot;King-Paper11 and book by the Pension Issue Cifice, and enquiry is being made of Looal Committees as to their ability to do this. 11.   Scoiprocal Out-patient Treatment. It has been arranged with the Australian, Canadiant and JNew Zealand authorities, that they will make no charge in respect of Imperial soldiers treated as out-patients in their military hospitals, and similarly that no charges shall be made for soldiers of the forces of these Dominions who receive out-patient treatment in Imperial military hospitals. (A,C* 1*1644). 12.   Medical Referees. Tue Committee of Selection for the appointment of iviedical Heferees held a further meeting this week and agreed on recommendations to the minister for the appoint-ment of Medical Practitioners in the Counties of Middlesex and in parts of 2ssex, lent and Surrey.13.   Survey of Institutional Accommodation. The provision of institutional accommodation for oases of neurasthenia, paraplegia, epilepsy amd tuberculosis is, as has frequently been reported in the hands of the Joint Committee on Institutionaltroatmentc
teoatment.   But evidence is accumulating that institutional provision for other classes of cases, e,g. cases needing convalescent treatment, treatment for rheumatism and minor surgical treatment (such as dressings for cases of wound and injury) is deficient in many areas, and disabled men requiring it are obliged frequently to travel long distances.T&amp;e need is at the moment being met to a great extent by the Red Cross Society1s organization through the hospitals set up Ijy them for war purposes but these institutions would naturally close down with demobilization, and the difficulties of the situation would then become, acute.    It is necessary to take steps to prevent such a contingency, and for this purpose the immediate need is a oareful survey of the existing institutional accommodation of lire countryj including-the temporary institutions set up by the Red Cross Society or private voluntary enterprise.   Such a survey will alone make it possible to say where institutions for the several kinds of treatment are needed and how far the Red Cross hospitals should be preserved after demobilization to serve there needs.The Minister has accordingly decided to ask the Joint Committee on Institutional Treatment to undertake this further task, and as it is not possible to consider the needs of the discharged man apart from those of the civil population of which he forms part, invite 2ho Local Government Board is being invited to associate itself with the enquiry.   The Minister is aooordingly appointing Sir Arthur Newsholme, Chief Medical Officer of the Local Government Board, and a represent-ative of the war uffioe to be additional members of the Committe and it is proposed that a Sub-Committee of the full Committee shall at once proceed with the nooessary work of survey. 14*    Joint Committoe on Institutional Treatment, The 28th meeting of the Committee was held on the 8th instant.   A Report od the Proceedings is contained in Appendix IX. The principal topic of discussion was tho additional provision to be madefor
for Orthopaedic treatment.   A representative of the Inspector of Military Orthopaedics attended the Committee and explained the great need for such provision, owing to the pressure on the accommodation and staff of the Military Orthopaedic Centres.The necessary information for which representatives of the Ministry have bean asked as to tho districts for which additional Orthopaedic treatment should be provided, will, it is hoped, be furnished within the next few days. 1ft.   Injuries et/n-r causing Dig-ability. Appendix 11 gived the. classification of the disabilities for which officers and men of both the Army and the Eavy have been discahrged U ) during the month of October, 1917, and (0) since the beginning of the war up to the end of October.16.   Limbless Men^   Appendix XI gives tho number of limbless men admitted or awaiting admission to limb fitting hospitals or otherwise dealt with up to the 31st October.   It shows a total of 23,168 as against last month1s total of 21,713 and a waiting list of 9S18 as against last month&apos;s figure of 8,897 - an increase of 721.   Up to the same date 8,371 artifiaial legs &amp;nt% 4,510 artificial arms or a total of 12,881 had been supplied or wore on order.During October the following numbers were admitted to discharged from the various limbfittiug hospitals, Mamo&apos; of Hospital:- MjlJX^*$b&amp; P-0 -.

WT &quot;684&quot;&quot;j?rom its opening in June 1915, up to the 31st October, 193.7, Dover House has fitted 451 officers with artifi-cial limbs.   On the latter date 165 were undergoing treatment 0:wore
&quot;&apos;&apos;jvwere being otherwise looked after, 20? were on a waitinglist. 823 officers oases were thus accounted for.17.   Eyesight Cases. The number of pensioners with injuredeyesight, as shown by Appendix      is as followsArmy warrant officers.U.C.0.S ........ 6048and menSeamen and Marines.................... 941Army Officers .........................   52Navy Officers.........................   227063From the beginning of the war to the end of October 817 totally blind soldiers and sailors have been admitted to the Blinded ooldiers and Sailors Hostel, St. Dunstanrs, Regents Park, and its annexes, of whom 308 have passed through.   Of this number 270 have been fully trained and have set up for themselves and the remaining 38, owing to men-tal or physical disability, have loft without being set up. 43 men were admitted during October, 13 wore discharged and at the end of the month there were 509 in residence.   105 in Hospital were to follow when fit to be discharged.With regard to blinded officers 22 are at present under instruction at St. Uunsta^&apos;s, 16 have left and 12 are waiting in Hospital till they are fit for discharge. 18.   After-care Colonies treatment for Tuberculosis.   A Conference was held at the Ministry on the 7th instant, at which representatives of the various bodies concerned with the treatment of tuberculosis were represented,   a Report of the Proceedings is given in Appendix XII.   From information obtained at the Conference, it would appear that at present no institution except that of the Royal Victoria i&apos;arm Colony, near Edinburgh, under the management of Sir Robert Phillip, is at present in a position to offer accommodation for discharged disabled men, although it is probable that two or throe other Institutions will be able to take patients early in the Mow Year.The Conference agreed unanimously as to theadvisability
advisability of an effort being made to secure After-care treatment combined with training for early cases of tuberculosis, and it was generally agreed that:-(a) An After-Care Colony could only be successfully conducted in close association with a Sanatorium, unless it were to have a resident Medical Officer of its own.(b ) The Medical Officer of the Sanatorium should &quot;be the judge of the suitability of a case for Colony treatment.(c) The suitability of a nan for a particular trade and his treatment generally in the Colony should be subject generally to medical supervision.19.   Treatment of Rheumatism. A notification, of which a copy is given in Appendix XIII has been sent to all Local Committees, indicating the Institutions in England and wales which provide treatment for rheumatism, and the charges made by each.   Patients can be sent to any one of these Institutions by Local Committees without sanction from the Ministry.20.   General rich ernes of Treatment. Appendix XIV. contains Report on tho General Schemes of treatment submitted or sanctioned during the week.21.   Individual Cases of Treatment. The groat bulk of cases of treatment arc under general schemes which have received approval, but a small number of cases requiring special treatment or treatment in institutions for which approval has not previously been given are submitted each week.   During the week ended the 7th November, 73 such cases were so sanctioned. 22.   Numbers under Treatment. Appendix XV shows the number of men for whom treatment has been provided under arrangements made or approved by the Ministry and to whom allowances under Article 6 of the Royal warrant are payable.   It will be soon that 289 cases were admitted for treatment during the week ended the 7th November and that 2616 men were under treatment on that  ; date, as compared with 2434 men at the end of the previous week.
The Table shows also the nature of the disablements for whi^h treatment was required, and it will be seen that more than two-fifths of the oases are of wounds or injuries. Bj- per cent being cases of paraplegia.93 cases of neurasthenia are under treatment at Golders Green and as an instance of the nature of employment given to the men there it may be mentioned that in the week ended the 3rd November 16 men worked an average of 14 hours in the Engineers Shop iO an average of 18 in the Carpenters Shop 9 an average of 15-g- in the Basket Shop and 8 an average of 13-1- in the Garden.32 oases of advanced tuberculosis are in the hospitals of the Metropolitan Asyluais Board in London.The number of discharged men in Lunatio asylums who have been admitted to the benefit of the special arrangements for &quot;Service Patients&quot; referred to in previous reports was, on the 7th instant, $00.   of these 117 had been admitted during the week.
TRAINING AND EMPLOYMENT.23*   Training at Lord Roberta1 Workshops.At the request of the authorities of the Lord Roberts Workshops negotiations have been opened in order to organise the work of this Institution In such a manner as to bring the work into line with the various Trade Advisory Committees.   This would enable the Minister of Pensions to recognise the Workshops and pay maintenance allowances to the men, 24,   Training at London PolytechnicThe Commanding Officer of the Royal Engineers Stores Department when lately  visiting this Institution was so pleased with the menTs. capabilities that he has made application for 30 of these men as mechanical and electrical examiners at the rate of pay 58/- for a 48 hour week.     Many more men of this type will be required and It would seem as if this should be a good field of training for men who have lost a limb. 25*   Training at Acton Hall, Wrexham.In paragraph 28 of Report XLI reference was made to the visit of the Minister to Wrexham to see Acton Hall and to Mr. Oppenheimer*s offer to purchase the property.     Mr, Oppenheimer? s offer has been accepted and in addition to his gift of 120 acres of valuable land for the welfare of disabled men he proposes to provide a training centre for the Diamond Cutting Industry to accommodate it is hoped, 500 men.     Further, the gardens are being placed at the disposal of the Ministry as a Horticultural and Small Holding training centre * 26.   Hostel at Sheffield.A communication has been received from The Lord Mayor of Sheffield stating that arrangements have now been made for the purchase of &quot;Norbury&quot;, the training Hostel referred to in paragraph 25 of last week&apos;s Report, and that he is securing financial assistance for the purchase of the premises.
27.   Trade Advisory Committee.Appendix XVI contains a report of Meetings held during the week ending 7th November by the Trade Advisory Committees representing Engineering and Shipbuilding, the Printing trades and Boot manufacture. 28.   Schemes of Training.Appendix XVII contains notes on schemes of training submitted by the Local Committees of the Isle of Ely, Gloucestershire, Sheffield, Kent, Darlington, and Caerphllly and by. the South Midlands Joint Area Committee.The training scheme from the University of Sheffield referred to in paragraph 25 of last we eft:1 s Report has now been received. 29.   Individual cases Of Training.During the week 77 cases of training outside approved schemes were sanctioned, 130 cases are still under consideration.30.   Number of men under Training.Appendix XVIII shows that 62 men wore admitted to and 12 discharged frovn training by Local Committees during the week and that the total number reported as under training at the end of this week was 682, 31. Interned men in Switzerland.A further course of training has been arranged for the Internees in Switzerland in Watch Repairing, the Y/atch Makers Association undertaking the cost of instruction and also to provide employment for the men who attain proficiency.     The Swis manufacturers have generously entered into the scheme and are providing gratuitously most of the machinery required,.
32.   Training of Widows.70 War-Widows have, up to the 31st October, applied for training under Article 14(3) of the Royal Warrant.     13 applications have been rejected, 24 have been sanctioned and the remaining 33 are under consideration.     In the case of the 24 widows whose applications have been sanctioned 3 widows have completed their training, 8 are under training, whilst 13 are awaiting training (Appendix XIX).Arrangements are being made with a number of the large business houses to receive sailorsT and soldiers1 widows for special coursesin Business Training and the terms so far made with Messrs. Selfridge are that they shall receive a sum of 25/- after one monthfs probation in the firmTs training school. Messrs Debenham and Freebody have also agreed in principle to train widows in their large factory and instruction school in Nottingham as well as their training school in London.     They are prepared to take up to 1000 women for training.      Arrangements are also being made with various schools and colleges in London for special courses of training.ORGANIZATION. 33.   Reports of Inspectors.Extracts from reports of Inspectors of Accounts for the week ended 7th November are contained in Appendix XX. In the N.W. Area the Blackburn Local Committee is well spoken of, Darwen continues to make incorrect payments whilst Eccles has co^ected payments wrongly made.     From Nottinghamshire comes a bad report;   the office was lately well reported on but on this occasion the chairman of the Local Committee ridiculed the idea of disabled men being visited at their homes, and the Clerk of the County Council opposed the registration of disabled men.     In the West Midlands Burton-on-Trent is on the whole satisfactory and Walsall has greatly improved.Aberyschan.
Abersychan, in Monmouthshire, which has lately been granted a Local Committee under the Naval &amp; Military War Pensions, &amp;c, (Administrative Expenses) Act leaves something to be desired. The London Sub-Committees appear to be working smoothly and well but there are complaints of delays with regard to separation allowances and at Lambeth It was stated that the Relieving Officers decline to assist cases of real need which do not come within the War Pension Regulations.    The Portsmouth Local Committee does itc work with credit to all concerned.The Ayrshire Local Committee have little control over their distriGv, Committees who have deliberately made payments contrary to the Regulations.The Cavan Local Committee only started work on the 1st September.    The estimates of the Galway Local Committee have not yet been approved.     In Westmeath there is the prospect of a considerable Increase In work, 34.   Special Grants Committee.A meeting of the Special Grants Committee was held on the 30th October.   The Minutes of this Meeting are annexed as Appendix XXI.The Pensions Minister attended the meeting and addressed the Committee regarding various resolutions put forward by them.    The Chairman replied and assured the Minister of the Committee!s earnest wish to assist the Ministry in every way in their power.The Committee considered the question of revising Part II Regulations in view of the new Government decision to abolish allotment, and it was decided at the next meeting to consider a prepared circular to Local Committees on the subject.The Committee considered the question of Local Committees dealing with contractual obligations up to a maximum of 16/- a week as now done by the Military Service (Civil Liabilitiesj Committee,
Correspondence on the question was considered and the proposal agreed to pending further correspondence on the subject with the Civil ^labilities Committee.a total sum of 1821 has been disbursed by the Special Grants Committee between the 1st September and 27th October in allowances,Under Part I, 32 cases were dealt with during the week, of which 36 were accepted and six refused.Under Part II 64 cases were dealt with during the week, of which 36 were aocepted and 28 refused.   There were no &quot;new oases in either Education or officers1 Branches during the week.Staff etc.36,   ilumbers of Staff,.tippondlx XXII shows an addition of 15 to the staff of the Ministry during tho week, there being a small increase or decrease in each Branch.     The staff on the books of the Ministry now comprises 283 men and 4,567 women, or 4,840 in all, 36*   Sick Percentage.Tho daily percentage of absences during the week-was 3-6 among the male and 5.2 among tho female37.   Resignations etc Luring the month of October, in whichthe staff increased from 4,426 to 4,825 or by 399, 2 men and200 women resigned, 3 women were transferred - anS 1 man wasofdismissed, a mo nth is percentage/4.15.   One   fifth 01 &quot;tneresignations were during tho first month of service and nearlyone half were due to domestic affairs or ill health.36&apos;   P&amp;y of Temporary Staff,   a return for the past monthcontained in Appendix XXIII shows the salaries of thetemporary staff.   Cut of 168 men there arc 70 with salariesof  150 a year or  3. 3. 0. p week and 56 with weekly salariesranging from 3l/fcd to 45/-, 11 are at tho highest rate of 250 a year.   Out of a female staff of 4,644 there are 3,738with Balarics from 25/- to 36/8d a rook and 377 v/ith4 are at the highest rate of  200 a year or just over.        39,

J 7Appendix XXIV shows that on the Staff of the Department there are now employed in London 18 officers Exclusive of 21 officers seconded for light duty until again fit for general service) and 45 men discharged disabled in eonse-quence of the present war,40. On the 9th instant Mr,L.T. Horns, AssistantSecretary to the Post Office, who has been in charge of the work at Chelsea sinco it was taken over from the Commissioners of Chelsea&apos; Hospital in February last, surrendered that charge on return to the Post Office to be the&apos;head of its Foreign and Colonial Branch,     On the same date Mr, Wilson Harris who had been working with Mr. Home also left Chelsea to take up an appointment in tho Ministry of Food.     During the time Mr. Home has been in charge of Chelsoa tho work and staff there have nearly trebled.     This great expansion has shown that the organization which may have been suitable to smaller activitiesdoes not serve present purposes, the failure being mainly inandanswering correspondence due to the different branches of tho work being conductod In small separate sections through which it has been difficult to trace papers and ensure replies being sent to letters without checking the procedure for tho award and renewal cf Pensions0     Something has been done to .improve matters by amalgamating sections and Mr, Home has boon elaborating the complete revision of organization which has boen referred to In a previous report.     In this work and by his unremitting labour in the difficult task of improving and keeping   functioning the machine of which he has been in charge, Mr, Home has rendered valuable services.

APPENDIX IX *JOINT COMMITTEE ON INSTITUTIONAL TREATMENT Minutes of Meeting.-The twenty eighth meeting of the Committee was held on Thursday November 8th, 1917, at Westminster House, Millbank.present,Lieut.Col.Sir Arthur Griffith Boscawen (Chairman)&quot;      &quot;   Sir Alfred Pearce Gould andGeneral Sir George Bullockwith Sir E, Eaward, flayer Patterson, Dro R,, Pox Symons, Ma j or Eh S, Hartley,&apos; Dr. C, Hubert Bond, and Mr. Ho re .Minutes.The minutes of the last meeting were confirmed..&apos; Paraplegia.(a) Dr. R. Fox Symons reported that up to 30th September last he had been notified of 1358 cases and during October the returns for which were not complete 33 making a total of 1391. 920 cases had been transferred up to 22nd October,43     &quot;       &quot;     &quot; &quot;       from then to 7th November.428     &quot;      Still remained to be dealt with.A general discussion took place on the new scale of payments to paraplegics which was coming into operation on 1st January next.   Dr. Fox Symons was asked and agreed to furnish a report to the Committee on the question of allowances to Paraplegics the probable effect of the new scheme and the general position as to the outlook from the standpoint of the mens welfare. Sir Harry Haward agreed to co-operate with Dr, Fox Syraons in the report from the financial aspect.   The report to be considered at the meeting to be held on the 29th instant.(b)   Mendel. Bromborough.Sir Arthur Boscawen reported that the authorities at this Home were desirous of taking in a certain number of convalescent cases in addition to Paraplegics although the Committee had previously decided that only, paraplegic cases should be doalt with and had notified the Institution authorities to that effect.   They had more beds available than would be required for paraplegics and desired they should be used.After discussion it was resolved to agree that convalescent cases be treated as well as paraplegics, provided they are done at the ordinary rate of 2l/- per week for convaxusoent cases and that they are kept quite apart from the paraplegic oases*   Mr, Cozons Hardy to be notified to tho above effect.Orthopaedics:(a)   Sir Arthur Bosoawcn explained the position with-   - regard
regard to Orthopaedic annexes and invited Major Patterson who was present representing Sir Robert Jones to give his views to the Committee.   Major Patterson said that the Orthopaedic centres were at present crowded out,   The Orthopaedic Hospitals were being occupied by a number of pensioners as in-patients who i$ug*Vbe provided for else whore as Military Hospitals are wanted for tho undischarged men0   A great number of.pensioners were being treated as out-patients at Military Hospitals and the extra work was becoming too severe on the various staffs.   He thought that provision should oe made to utilise the local civil hospitals in various towns for tho treatment of the orthopaedic A oase (that is the man who leavjs the Hospital and still requires out-patient orthopaedic treatment) and the B case (one requiring general surgical treatment as an out-patient).Evening olinios could be established in populous centres.   There was undoubtedly an urgent and general demand for proper out-patient treatment.   The treatment should be associated with some training scheme for the men and in some cases a hostel may be required for the accommodation of men who come in.   Sir Robert Jones would be glad to give the Committee any assistance or advice he could,A general discussion took place and it was agreed that the work of providing out-patient treatment should be undertaken by the Committee.   Mr. Hore said that he had written to the Ministry&apos;s representatives throughout the country with regard to the matter and would furnish a report to the Committoo at its meeting on the 15th instant.(b)   Royal London Orthopaedic Hospital.   Sir Alfred Pearce Gould reported on a visit Sir Arthur Boscawen and himself had made to this Institution on the 2nd instant.   There was some vacant land alongside the Hospital on which excellent hut workshops could be erected.   He thought that the Hospitals application for a grant towards the cost of workshops should be strongly supported.   The hospital had 170 beds for Orthopaedic cases and at present there were 120 soldier oases and between 30 and 40 discharged men being treated.It was resolved to recommend to the Ministry to support tho application to the extent of 75 per cent of the cost of workshops through His Majesty1 s Office of works the remaining  5 per cent of the cost to be provided by the Hospital authorities.ja)   Epileptic cases which are also paraplegic. Dr. Bond spoke&quot; of the difficulty of obtaining accommodation for these cases.   The Committee had authorised him at a prior meeting to endeavour to make some arrangements for accommodation at a ra^e up to  2. 2. 0 per weekr,   &quot;with this object in view he had paid a visit to the national Hospital for Epilepsy at Queens Square.   It was impossible to get accommodation anywhere else ahd he strongly recommended that the sum of  500 be paid to the Hospital to repair and adapt a vacant house alongside the hospital which would provide accommodation for 16 beds.   Tho Hospital authorities would prohfc&amp;.ly accept this.   His talk tfith the Secretary of the Hospital was unofficial and informal.It was resolved to recommend to tho Ministry that a letter be written to the Secretary of the Hospital askingif
if they would be prepared to provide accommodation for 16 patients and if so on what terms and conditions.   This letter not to be written until after Dr..Bond had paid another visit to -the Hospital, &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;(b) Lingfield:Br. Bond reported that an assistant Medical Officer (Dr.3.0sborn) had been appointed.   The Superintendent (Dr*Hume Griffith) desirod that visits by R.A.M.C Officers to the Colony to see soldier cases on behalf (they state) of the Ministry of Pensions be discontinued.   It was having a very bad effect on the patients.   Mr. Boughey undertook to make enquiries at Chelsea relative to the matter and report the result to the meeting on the 15th instant.(c) Lingfield Villas.Dr. Bond raised the question of the two villas at Lingfield.   The Red Cross had provisionally agreed some time ago to their erection but for various reasons the matter was still in abeyance.The position was that he oould not find accommodation for all the cases of Epilepsy and there was an urgent and growing demand for same,   tfour villas were wanted instead of two.   It was agreed that Dr. Bond should interview the Hon. Sir Arthur Stanley on the question and report to a subsequent meeting.Tuberculosis:(a) Sanatorium treatment for Officers.    Sir Alfred Pearoe Gould&apos;s minute on this matter was placed before the Committee and considered.   A general discussion took place on the position.   It was agrood that the treatment of discharged officers was a matter for the Ministry, tho Red Cross and the war Office looking after the undischarged cases.   Jt was resolved to recommend to the Ministry that a letter be written to Lady Dudloy asking her to inform the Ministry of any applications from Pensioned officers which go to her.   Itwas also further agreed&apos;to recommend that a letter be written by the ministry to the Local Government Board asking them to notify tho Ministry as soon as an Officer was admitted to an Institution.(b) Papworth Hall:Sir Arthur Boscawon reported that the authorities at Papworth Hall were asking for payment of the  3000 under the terms of the agreement.   It was decided to recommend that a letter be written by the ministry to Mrs. Dimsdalo with reference to heraapplication and informing her that if a formal request is made for the amount it will be forwarded.(c) Cottages at Papworth:   Sir Alfred Pearce Gould reported that thore were eight pairs of oottages on the estate still unsold which could be purchased at  250 per pair.   Thoy wero within a quarter of a milo of the Hall and it would he a good oxperiment in connection with treatment.   They could be kept for discharged tuberculous soldiers who were undergoing Colony treatment.   Tho authorities at Papworth wanted fundsto erect workshops ( 600) fifty more shelters at  20 each and if possible have electric light installed at a cost of  100.A
h .genoral discussion took place on the question of acquiring the cottages and Sir-Alfred i?earce Gould was asked and agreed to communicate with Mrs. Dimsdale and bring forward a definite scheme to tho Committee.   Sir Harry Haward agreed to co-operate and look into the financial aspect.Survey of Institutional Accommodation: Sir Arthur Boscawen read i&amp;nutes by Sir Matthew imthan; Mr. Hore &amp;nd himself relative to thi3 question.The Institutional Committee would undertake tho work and Sir A. Newsholme wo-lild be added to it to assist.   A general discussion took place and Mr. Hore was asked &amp;h&amp; agreed to arrange a date  or the first meeting.Bristol:   PropOued Hospitap. for making supplying and fitting artificial limbs:   A letter datod 29th October from Mr. Hadcliffe Hon. Sec. western Counties Joint (^Disablement) Committee was read conveying the following resolution of his Executive Committee &quot;That representation be made to the Ministry of Pensions as to the desirability of a fully equipped Hospital at Bristol for making supplying and fitting artificiallimbs&quot;..It was decided to ask that further particulars beforwarded.

The gross coat works cut at 27/- a weok por head but the net cost after deducting the sale of products is not much more than half this.     These figures are, however, based on pre-war prices; the presont cost is 3omowhat higher.     Sir Robert Phillip gave It as his opinion that a farm colony should not ordinarily exceed provision for about 50 inmates*Mr. Fraser explained the position at Hairmyres Colony,     At present the Colony has no adult inmates as the buildings are not yet quite completed, but he thought it should ablo to accommodate about 120 next January.     It was contemplated that the work provided at Hairmyros would bo mainly work on the land including market gardening and horticulturoi but it was proposed also to have some work-sheps.     It was stated, however, that these workshops weronot
ntt designed to serve the purpose of full industrial training but rather tc keep inmates occupied during wet weather or for cases which could not do heavy werk*Mrs. BImsdale explained the proposed scheme of Papwcrth Hall.     It was understood that this Instituticn is not yet occupied by tuberculosis patients but the necoasary alterations tc the premises are proceeding rapidly and provided they can get sufficient labour to complete them they should be able to accommodate patients early In the new year;     They contemplate that they will have accommoda^ tion for 50 sanatorium cases and 50 casos of aftercare combined with training.     It is1 proposed that asms, at any rate, t&apos;f the aftorcare patients should live in cottages on the estate and they have at present secured some six cr eight cottages for this purpose, where the mm would either live alone cr with his family.     The institution is now als* building workshops and will be glad of assistance for this purpose4     The training proposed to be given for the most part is that suitablo to turning out the &quot;handy man&quot;^ including minor repairs to motor machinery$ motor driving. Carpentry otc *. but they would also be taught taIloring^ jewellery work and gardening,Mr. Evans, for the Welsh Memorial Association stated that they had about 150 acres cf land at the North Wales Sanatorium and they had 75 beds unoccupied at present In thet Instituticn.     These beds wore in a separate block and they would be willing to devote this block together with a suitable proportion of the ground to training.     Primarily they had contemplated agricultural training but they would be prepared to give industrial training if the necessary workshops could bo provided.Colonel David Davies supported the proposal of Mr, Evans and said thero Is no reason why treatment and train-ing should not go on in any sanatorium. , He argued also in favour of tuberculosis colonies In the senso of settlements In the neighbourhood of a sanatorium on which men who had pacsed through the sanatorium could sottle pormanently with their families and have the advantage of medical supervision.Dr.. Paterson objected strongly to the suggestion that treatment and training should go. on simultaneously. The graduated labour provided in a Sanatorium was an entirely different thing from genuine vocational training and the tendency would be to keep the man at the job at which he was successful simply on that account and without regard tc the medical requirement of his case.     Ke thought that any scleme for training \ub9rculcus men should be carried on on Its separately fror the administration of the sanatorium.Ke
Ho insisted strongly on the Superintendent of the Sanatorium being the judge as to the fitness of the patient for the training colony after his stay in the sanatorium and this view was supported by all the Members of the Conference,Dr. Paterson further emphasised the necessity lor tho Colony dealing not only with Industrial training but with aftercare generally..     On the question of the trades for which tuberculous cases can most suitably be trained he expressed the opinion that the difficulty was rather tc say what trades were not suitable.     Everything depended on the existing conditions under which the individual man worked, which varied from one workshop to another even more than from one trade to anotheriSir Arthur Newsholme made a point that the training colony should be always noar a sanatorium In order to allow of proper medical supervision.Dr. Perkins, cn behalf of tho Association for the Prevention cf Consumption said hi3 Association had a proposal before it which he thought would be acceptod for taking a farm a few miles from a large existing sanatorium which would probably accommodate about 50 patients.     The Association would bo quite prepared to tako suitable patients to be paid for by tha Ministry.;Ministry of Pensions, 0. Hi 17.

APPENDIX XIV TREATMENT.Report of Schemes eto, sanctionod during the week ending8th November, 1917.1.     A complete scheme for the area of the John Advisory Committee of North Wales has beon received this weeki     This Committee have submitted their proposed arrangements with Military, Auxiliary and Civil Institutions within their aroa and included in their schemes several Institutions outside the aroa of the Joint Advisory Committee of service to the cOn-stituent Local Committees for the provision of specialist treat-mont.     Of the Institutions proposed to be used,&quot; forty were sanctioned and further information was requested as to the treatment provided in and the foes charged by the few remaining Institutions.     The proposed arrangements for tho provision of Convalescent treatment did not appear to bo adequate for the probable requirements of tho aroa and the Committee wore accordingly requested to communicate with all tho Institutions in thoir aroa available for the purpose and endeavour to make suitable provision.     Otherwise the scheme was sufficiently comprehensive and incorporated facilities for tho provision of every class of treatment likely to be required.     The forty institutions now sanctioned are adequate for the immediate requirements of the locality ponding tho result of further enquiry and tho receipt of the desired information concerning the other Institutions set forth in the scheme.2.     The Lancashire Looal Committee have received general sanction to tho use of tho St. Mary&apos;s Homo, Moston at a fee of 21/- weekly.     This institution will bo incorporated in the schemo for the area which is in course of preparation.3.     A letter was received from the Ingham Infirmary South Shields requesting information as to the Ministryfs terms for treatment.     The Infirmary was informed of tho rates prescribed by Schedule I and the question referred to the Minister&apos;s Representative for the area,-4.     Tho Local Committees of Middlesex, Wiltshire, Haddington, Radnorshire, Dudley^ Southend-on-Soa, Fifeshire, Perthshire and North Sootland,have submitted schemes for treatmon which aro now under consideration,- and will be dealt with in next woek&apos;s report.

APPENDIX XVI I400TRAINING.SCHEMES SUBMITTED OR SANCTIONED DURING ..E2K ENDED 7th NOVEMBER, 1917.1. The Looal Committee for the Isle of Ely havesubmitted a scheme for training disabled men in i?ruit, Slower and Vegetable Culture.   The Committee have been informed that the Minister is prepared to sanction the scheme provisionally for a period of 6 months, at the end of which a report is to be furnished on the working of the scheme showing how far the training has been satisfactory in order that the Minister may consider the question of granting final sanction to the full Course.2. The Gloucestershire Local Committee have submittedproposals to train disabled men in various subjects at the Gloucestershire School of Art.   The Course of Training in Ticket writing is approved, provided the Committee are satisfied that the training is likely to enable the men when trained to obtain permanent employment in this trade. The Committee have been informed that sanction for training in Carpentry and Photo process block making mast be withheld until the appropriate Trade Advisory Committees have decided upon the general conditions to be adopted in regard to the training of disabled men for these industries.3. The Joint Committee for Bedfordshire, Hertfordshireand Huntingdonshire have submitted a scheme for training disabled men in Basket making, to be provided at Colne, Hertfordshire.   This scheme has been approved conditional upon Mr. Playter, Secretary of the Trade Advisory Committee in Basket making, being satisfied that the Instructor is competent and that the Syllabus of Instruction is of a suitable character.4. The Sheffield Local Committee have submitted a schemefor training disabled men in Lamp working, which has been approved.5. The kent r.ocal Committee have submitted a scheme fortraining disabled men in Boot making at Messrs. Randall and Co&apos;s workshops, Maidstone.

ORGANIZATION BRANCHExtraots from Reports of Inspectors for week ended 7th November. 1917,NOTTINGHAMSHIRE LOCAL COMMITTEE.A somewhat unsatisfactory report from the Inspector on his last visit.   The Chairman ridiculed the suggestion with regard to disabled men that they should be visited in their homes.   He is reported as stating &quot;That they know where the Offices are and if they want anything they are able to come to the Offices and ask for it, that it was all stuff and nonsense to talk about finding the men out and they will have to oome to the Local Committee,&quot;   The Clerk of the County Council also objected to the idea of men being visited and opposed the suggestion of the registration of every man. This registration, it was said, would lead to the compiling of registers which nobody ever saw after they wero completed and which only meant a lamentable waste of time and money,   The Inspector reports a deplorable lack of organization and plainly told the Committee that they actually performed the barest minimum compared with the amount of work that ought to be done,Worksop Subcommittee.Tho area is divided into three parishes, there being a lady almoner in each.   These almoners receive applications which they investigate and report to the Committee,   The Committee consider every application at their fortnightly meeting and the Perms S,l, show careful consideration and thoroughness.   Some of the cases assisted are not in accordance with the Regulations but the Sub-Committee is anxious to put them right.DARWEN LOCAL COMMITTEE,Case-papers were examined by the Inspector and found to be in order.   Payments which previously had been reported as incorrect have nott/ceased.ECCLES LOCAL COMMITTEE.Cases to which the Inspector had previously drawn attention to he found on his last visit had been corrected.BLACKBURN LOCAL COMMITTEE.The investigation in this Committee&apos;s area is thorough and reliable, and the payments for Supplementary Allowances are very moderate considering the large population and v/herever checked have been found to be in order.   There have been some payments under Regulation 13(g) which would not appear to have been justified.APPbNDIa XZ.
BURTON ON TRENT LOCAL COMMITTEE. &quot;sThe town Is divided into eight Wards with corresponding Ward Committees,   Only Emergency Grants are made hut cases are prepared for the consideration of the Allowances Sub-Committee, The Regulations are generally observed,There is a general feeling that the wives and dependants of men serving who are in need of assistance should not have to apply elsewhere than to Local Committees, even although their necessities do not arise from the fact that the soldier is serving. The Inspector called the attention of the Committee to Regulation 7(1) (b) which had not been observed.As in the case of other Local Committees the Inspector found an abnormally large number of advances necessitated by the delay in the issue of Separation Allowances and points out hew very unsatisfactory is this state of affairs;   recoveries, however, are being satisfactorily made.The work of this Committee is on the whole satisfactory but a little caution from time to time is necessary to keep the Committee up to the mark,LANCASHIRE LOCAL COMMITTEE.Bla ckburn Pair al 0 own it tee.only a small scattered population in the area with three or four cases in receipt of grants.WALSALL LOCAL COMMITTEE.The Inspector reports that he is satisfied -Jhat a very large amount of work is being done,   The Regulations are observed and the financial system is now excellent.   The papers are well kept,(This report is satisfactory in view of the fact that towards the end of last year Walsall was one of the worst Committees In the United Kingdom).PORTSMOUTH LOCAL COMMITTEE.The whole of the work of this Committee is done systematically and thoroughly and great credit is due to all concerned.   The cases are well under supervision and a revision is periodically carried out.LONDON LOCAL COMMITTEE.Battersea Sub-Committee.No infringements of the Regulations could be found.   The accounts are well kept and audited up to August 30th.   There are between 6C and 80 regular visitors working on this Sub-Committee,
/ l&apos;he Inspector reports t-liat pensions for men arerj.&apos;he Inspector reports that pensions for men are quickly received; oh the other hand there seems delay over pensions for widows and dependants,There appears to he a growing increase in delays with Separation Allowances for dependants.     One case quoted being eight months in arrears.Regulation 13(g) appears to give rise to some difficulties.Lambeth Sub-Committee.No infringements of the Regulations found.     The accounts are well kept and ready for audit to tho 31st August.Difficulty is being experienced by the Relieving Officers declining to assist cases of real need which cannot be relieved under War Pensions Regulations.Finsbury Sub-Committee.No infringements of the Regulations.     The Accounts are well kept.Long delays complained of regarding Separation Allov/ances f.or dependants which are seldom received under four months.Complaints v/ere made by the Vice-Chairman as to the delay in getting answers from the Ministry.St. Marylebqne Sub-Committee.No infringements of the Regulations.     Mens pensions are received fairly promptly.     Undue delay Is reported In connection with Separation Allowances in cases connected with the Paymaster at Nottingham.     There are 61 cases in arrear, dating back from two to four months.The work of the Sub-Committee is well done, Islington Sub-Comrni11ee.No infringements of the Regulations.     Payments are undertaken in this Sub-Committee on behalf of the Civil Liabilities Committee.     The work of this Stib-Committee appeared to the Inspector to be particularly well done.CAVAN LOCAL COMMI^A. wu-lj-lii tThis Committee only started work on the 1st September and thero have been very few transactions up to the present.     The administrative expenses for the period of 17th May to 31st March, 1913 are estimated at  87 and have beon approved by the Local Government Board.GAL :/-Y LOCAL CQLMITTZS .The County Council have refused to consider the estimate submitted by this Local Committee and have forwarded it to the Local Government Board for consideration.     No approval has 3^et been received by the Local Committee.
gSTMSATH LOCAL COMMITTEEOn examination it was found that the accounts had not been drawn up in accordance with the Regulations and the &apos; Secretary has consequently been instructed to make out new statements on the proper form and tc get them audited as soon as possible,.There are 17 Subcommittees in course of formation and there is prospect of a considerable increase in the work.COUNTY OF MQNMOUTH LOCAL COMMITTEE.Abersychan District Committee,Greater discrimination is now shown in making grants and allowances but the organization of this Sub-Committee leaves much to be desired.The details of treatment and training appear to be quiteunknown.The Inspector will make a further visit shortly.Panteg District Committee,This is one of the smaller District Committees and the help rendered by employers to the wives of soldiers keeps down the payments,Very little Is done for discharged soldiers in the ^strict, of whom there are over 100.AYRSHIRE LOCAL COMMITTEE.This Committee has not been very well organised and there seems to be little control exercised over District Committees by the Local Committee,   The majority of the District Committees of this County have been paying all rents, even under 4/- a week.   They have not done this unintentionally but deliberately.   A strong letter will be forwarded to this Committee on the subject.Ayr Borough Sub-Committee.This Committee Is adhering to the Regulations.    Outstanding sums have nearly all been recovered,Kilinarnock Sub-C ommittee.It is interesting to note that this District Committee spend nearly  1,500 per Quarter, whereas Ayr Borough with a population of about the same spend only  500 per Quarter,   The books are fairly well kept.Ayr Landward Sub-Committee.The books are fairly well kept and the Committee are adhering to the Regulations.
1PFBHDIZ   SSlV 49SPECIAL   CHANTS   COMMITTEE.Minutes of Meeting held at 28 Abingdon Street, S.W. on Tuesday, 30th October 1917.PRESENT.CJ.Mathew, Esq., (in the Chair)Coles Child, Esq.,B.B.Cu.jitt, Esq. ,H.Goslins, Esq.,Miss Kelly,Gorporal Linard,W.L.Marshall, Esq.,Mrs.McKenna,lies. Shake spear ,Sir Frederiok Stopford,Ben Turner, Esq.,1.     The Ohair was taken by the Chairman,2.     The Pensions Minister attended and addressed the meeting on the various resolutions Y/hioh had been put forward by them.    The Chairman replied and thanked the Pensions Minister on behalf of the Committee and assured him of their earnest wish to assist the Pensions Minister to the utmost of their oapabilities.3,     The Minutes of the meeting held on 16th October which had been circulated to members, v/ere confirmed and signtfi by the Chairman.4.     A question which had been referred by the Ministry as towhether the Special Grants Committee considered it ad-visable that discharged disaoled soldiers should carry with them a record of the assistance granted them by Local Committees and some means of identification, and &apos; whether such information would enable Local Committees more freely to assist cases of real need, or whether there were objections to the suggestion, was duly con-sidered.   After considerable discussion it was decided to defer the final decision of this matter until the next meeting.
The following letter received from the Treasury in reply tothe recommendation of the Special Grants Committee, havingreference to the allotment made by soldiers, which had beenforwarded through the Ministry, was duly read, and it wasdecided tP bring before the next meeting of the SpecialGrants Committee on November 6th for their approval a consideredcircular to be issued to Local Committees&quot;I have laid before the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty1s Treasury your letter of the 10th instant enclosing copy of a letter received from the Special Grants Committee on the subject of alterations in the Regulations of the Statutory Committee which they now administer, consequential on the scheme recently announced by His Majesty1s Government for improving the pay of men serving in the Forces.In the circumstances My Lords are constrained to agree that the condition of voluntary allotment from the man&apos;s pay which has hitherto formed the most satisfactory test of the genuineness of a claim for separation allowance to the dependant must be abandoned.     No other test being suggested it will be necessary to rely entirely on the administrative action of the Local Pension Conimittees in ascertaining the facts of each case before recommending a grant; and My Lords trust that the Minister of Pensions will represent to the Committees the importance of using the utmost possible caution in this respect in order to resist unwarranted claims. - Special attention should be drawn to applications by the dependants of men who though enlisted before the recent announcement by His Majesty&apos;s Government had not up to that date made an allotment from their pay.     V;hile My Lords do not wish absolutely to exclude such claims, They think that special grounds such as change of family conditions should be adduced before a grant in these cases could be contemplated or made.     Clearly, cases Y/here a man had been asked to allot, and had refused, ought to be ruled out entirely.Subject to these observations, My Lords concur in the recommendations of the Special Grants Committee, and authorise an immediate amendment of their Regulations to give effect thereto.&quot;The arrangement made by the Ministry, Officers&apos; Branch, withthe Education Section in regard to the settlement ofeducation cases and more especially in respect of assessingthe respective financial liabilities, was duly approved.
The following letter reoeived by the Ministry from the Civil Liabilities Committee in reply to a recommendation of the Speoial Grants Committee was duly considered, and it was decided to agree to the proposals submitted by the Civil Liabilities Committee up to a maximum of 15/- a week as suggested:-, &quot;In reply to your letter of the 13th instant (626l) enolosing a memorandum prepared by the Special Grants Committee of the Ministry of Pensions, I am directed by the Military Service (Civil Liabilities) Committee to state that they agree with the view of the Special Grants Committee that it is desirable that the &quot;smaller oases&quot; should be dealt with by the Local War Pensions Committee rather than by the Civil Liabilities Committee,They will therefore be glad if the powers of Local Committees oan be extended in the directions proposed.They would suggest, however, that the question should be further considered whether the allowances to be made by the Local Committees should in all oases be limited to the amount of the excess of the obligations over 4/- a week.   If this deduotion of 4/- a week is maintained in all cases, it appears to the Civil Liabilities Committee that there will be many oaees, which should preferably be dealt with by a Looal Committee, in which the assistance whioh could be afforded by the Local Committee would be inadequate, having regard to the previous standard of comfort of the family.In the event of proposals on the lines indicated &apos; in the memorandum being brought into operation, it would also no doubt be necessary for the Ministry of Pensions to make It olear that in cases covered by the new Regulations, application for assistance must be made to the War Pensions Committees and that suoh oases would not be dealt with by the Civil Liabilities Committee.Prom this point of view it is a matter for oon-sideration whether the proposal to empower the Local Committees to deal with cases in which the obligations amount to  1 a week does not 20 too far, and&apos; itwould per-haps be better to fix a lower limit, say 15/- a week.&quot;
