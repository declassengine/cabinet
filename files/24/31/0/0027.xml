(Tills Doeumlmi i* tht Property ofn;:n rUm -*J       *WH Britannic Maj?gty?g Government.). 158mmmm for the war cabinet . 1 fliATERNITY AIID .INFAMT WELFARE.I disagree with Dr. Addison*s note as to the opposition to the Bill prepared by the president of the Local Government Board\   I believe any Bill will provoke some opposition.  But as to the criticism Dr. Addison passes on the Minor Local Authorities, it is really too late in tho day to talk about Local Authorities being poor Law Bodies.If we are to return to separate bodies for each local public duty, we shall be adopting a most re-actionary policy.   Experience- has taught us that the multiplication of local Government bodies results in a scarcity of candidates&apos;, and indifference of electors.The Hinor Local Authorities discharge many duties-. It was not%found to be a bar that they administer the Poor Law when they were elected to act as Tribunals for National Service, as the Local Committees for Agricultural work, and for many other duties - why should it be regarded as an insuperable objection nor?    Moreover the control of the arrangements will be in the hands of the Local Government Board who will thus be able to secure that the work is develop--ed by those authorities, in some cases County Councils &apos;in others Sanitary Authorities&apos;, who are best fitted to do it.The Bill was the result of many Conferences and much consultation: has a great deal of support; is much needed, it can-, I believe, be passed with reason-able ease, and I hope it will be introduced and carriedY&quot; *H.L**6.11.17&apos;.
