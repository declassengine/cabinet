GqjouelHis Britannic Majesty^ Government.(This Document is the ProjBBPRESEPTATION OF THE PEOPLE473, V      /During the debate on clause 5 of the Bill (which deals with &apos;^the naval and military vote) proposals were made for giving a vote to soldiers and sailors who have served in this war, at the age of nineteen.     There was considerable-opposition to the proposal from Liberals, including some sitting on the frt/nt Opposition Bench. I promised to submit the proposal before the Report Stage, to my colleagues for their favourable consideration and on this assurance the amendment was withdrawn.The question now arises whether the proposal should be acceded to, and I should like to have the decision of the War Cabinet on this point.     Personally I am in favour of it.If the vote is given to soldiers and sailors /who have fought in this war at the age of nineteen, I presume that there should be some reduction cf the qualifying age in the case of Army nurses and other women coming within the clause, who have served in the war, and I suggest that the age in their case might be fixed at twenty five.i November, 1917. qa GAVE.
