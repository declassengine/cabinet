C RET,-- WAR   CABII3T.2560.-   &apos; TRANSPORT OF CHINESE PI0N13R BATTALIONS TO FItAKOS.Admiralty Memorandum for War Cabinet.Tbe French proposal to employ 40,000 Chinese Pioneer Troops on the Western Front presents three naval problems -1.     Provision of tonnage. 2.     Choice of route. 3.     Provision of escort.I.     Tonnage.The Shipping Controller dealt with the question of providing tonnage in his letter of November 1st to the Secretary of the !7sr Cabinet in which he suggested that, as Chinese Battalions could only be carried in British tonnage to the exclusion of the Coolies, Japanese ships should be used (with the one or two enemy ships interned in Chinese ports that may be suitable).     The use of Japanese tonnage would reduce the amount available for carrying Japanese troops to France or Mesopotamia.Assuming that the troops would be packer&quot;1 much closer than white troops, 20 to 30 ships of moderate size would be required.2.   Route.The routes by which the Chinese troops might be sent are: -fa)   Via Colombo and Port Said to Taranto or Marseilles.(b) Via Canada or the United States to Marseilles or Brest.(c) Via the Cape of Good Hope to Marseilles or Brest.
-   -(a) The Port Said route is the shortest and would be the best were our Escorting Forces in the Mediterranean equal to the extra demand, but being already worked to their utmost they could provide no adequate escort if the situation were normal:    if a large move of British troops.were in process, they could provide no escort at &amp;11.(b) The Trans-America route could be used if arrangements could be made for Japanese ships to embark the troops at Atlantic ports and join the Gibraltar convoy, being taken on by a French escort from Gibraltar to Marseilles, or to Brest from a rendezvous in the Bay.(o)   The Cape route is much longer but could be used if the transports could be inoluded in the troop convoys from the Ca pe to England and escorted to Marseilles by French destroyers from a rendezvous west of Gibraltar, or to Brest cr St. Kazaire from a rendezvous in the Bay.(There is little chance of any of the French Bay ports being able to deal with these troops in addition to their present commitments).3.   Escort.whichever route is adopted a soecial British escort can-not bo provided.    The escort difficulty precludes the use of the ?ort Said route, at any rate uhlels the troops are transported in very small units (-vhioh could join a Mediterranean convoy) and for both the Trans-America and the Gaoe routes French escorts \::ould -jq necessary.Generally, if the shipping is available, there is no insurmountable difficulty in the move of 40,000 Chinese troops to France, and it is possible that when the time
came it could be arranged to fit the ships in with a convoy.     At the present time the most suitable arrangement from a convey and escort point cf view would be to send them either via the Cape to Marseilles or across America to Gibraltar and Marseilles, unless the numbers at any one time were so few that they could be joined in a convoy from Port Said in the Mediterranean,In any case no special escort could be provided by British craft, and the matter is submitted to the War Cabinet in order that, should the move be decided on,  it may be made clear &quot;to the French Government that their co-operation tc the extent of providing escorting Teasels is-assumed(Signed)     1RIC GWmm.9th November,  1917.
