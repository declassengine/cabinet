In my Note covering the Minutes of the Second Meeting of the War Priorities Committee (G.T.2168) I stated that the Minister of Munitions desired that the attention of the War Cabinet should be drawn to his dissent from the first conclusion of the Committee: 

"That the reduced airship programme was essential and that the sanction of the War Cabinet to the same should accordingly be sought".

By Mr. Churchill&apos;s expressed desire I append below a copy of a Note by the Minister of Munitions giving his reasons for dissenting from the above conclusion.

I also append a copy of the Admiralty reply to Mr. Churchill&apos;s Note (?.P.C.3).

The approval or otherwise of the War Cabinet to the decisions of the War Priorities Committee at their Second Meeting, is a matter of urgency.

AIRSHIP     PROGRAMME.IK^TE by the Minister of Munitions.The Airshin Programme cannot mature effectively till the latter part of&quot;l9l8 or fully until 1919;   &quot;that part of the Airship Programme which is dependont on the new building and housing sheds oannot mature effectively till 19-9-     ^ meanwhile the erection of these sheds will hamper and impair the execution of the far mote urgent Aeroplaxoe Programme required for the spring and surfer of 19I0 by withdrawing both skilled labour and materials wnich are direccly needed for the development of the Aeroplane Programme,     When the Airship Programme is fully completed in 1919 it will Involve a serious inroad upon our supplies of skilled labou:-.- aad aluminium.     If the war continues into 1919 the competition of these airships in skilled labour and aluminium will make a serious inroad on the aeroplane service of that year.   There is good reason tb believe that if the war lasts until 1919 aeroplane warfare by bombing and co^nt-er-bombing and the general struggle for mastery in the air bv heavier than air machines will require the whole of our available resources and energies and we ought not now to embark on programmes of airship construction which if they are to mature at all can only do so at the cost in 1919 of the aeroplane service.     We run a great risk of spending labour and steel in 1917 and 1918 upon the erection of sheds for airship construction which when 1919 comes will be discarded in favour of far more urgent needs of aeroplane warfare.     If on the other hand the war does not last until 1919 we are simply hampering ourselves in the meanwhile in dealing with the real emergencies and dangers of I918 and wasting labour and war effort upon a service which will not be ready in time.In these oircumstances I consider that the question Of airship construction cannot be settled apart frvm a general consideration of the war plan.(Signed)     WINSTON S. CHURCHILL.Armament Buildings, 11th October, 1917.
n *Admiralty Reply to note by minister of Munitions aatoo.11th October.The premises on nhicli the Linister of Lluuitions bases his crgument against rigid airships pre :-(1) That the Programme of the&apos;A&amp;niralty Trill not bo effective in time for this rrar..(2) That airships are so expensive on conprriso with aeroplanes rnd of so little relative use that the should not bo constructed.The other statements that material and labour devoted to airships uill not he availrble for aeroplanes are self-evident.If it is decided that airships cannot bo obtained in time or are not likely to be useful, then manifestly it T?i 11 not be vjorth uhile to do vote to them material thai is needed elsewhere.The facts are as follows :- -(1) Rigid airships Trill come into service in accordance viva the following table. .

All these ships will be constructed in existing building berths .     It will be evident that as soon as any of these ships are launched the programme will begin to become effective, if housing accommodation is available for their effective U3e .   At present housing accommodation is confined on the East Coast, and the use of the ships will, therefore, be confined to the East Coast until Housing Sheds are erected in Ireland and the West .It was to remedy this defect and to gain full value from the superior air endurance of those large rigid vessels in the important work of convoy and submarine scouting that housing sheds were projected in Ireland and the WestThe follovdng table shews the requirement of steel in the modified programme agreed with General Smuts , and it will be noticed that of 7^CaO-tons of mild steel required none is appropriated to building sheds, ore. almost the whole is intended for the purpose stated above, namely the protect-ion of merchant vessis bringing our supplies to the West Coast.Old Estimate 20,000-tonsall mild&apos;-steel. &quot;&quot;MiltS SteelNev,^ Est imate &quot;lllcjlc^tbnsDi s c ar d    \&apos;l l re     Total.ing Shed ng Shed3,100 9,300 2 ,1602,550 1,5002,550       1,350     6*450100     1,SC0igid shedseens 2,700gen Plates 1*700ay Sidings 1,000500 1,7/00 1,0006651001,065 1,7001*00013,S607,0503,215     1,55011,815-It is evident that the Minister of Munitions failed to understand that we asked for no steel for sheds for building airships , and that the steel devoted to housing sheds will come into immediate effect when these sheds are complete .(2)   The opinion held by the Minister of Munitions that air-ships are of little value as compared to aeroplanes or at all events are not worth the necessary material.and labour is in conflict with the views held by the Naval Staff, and as the matter is one essentially for decision by the Naval Staff it does not seem appropriate to discuss the question in this Memorandum..   It may, however, be noted that we have been assured by the Ministry that our demand on aluminium, namely; 50-tons for each airship of the latest Zeppelin type is not likely to cause inconvenience.   The total production of aluminium in 191? is reckoned at 24,500 tons, and of this the pure aluminium Is about 1300 tons,
In addition must.also be&apos; added a certain quantity produced in the United Kingdom. Further, that the skilled labour required in building airships can , In the main , be female labour /and that the labour required for the&apos;construction of aeroplanes is essentially different from that required for the construction of airships ,(signed)   Alan C. Andersen.( (iController)26th October, 1917.
Enclosure Ho. II. Additional Note by FIFTH   SEA LORD,With regard to the argument that the Airship Programme ?fhen fully complete in 1919 will involve a serious inroad upon our supplies of skilled labour end aluminium, it should be pointed out :-(a) That less than 350 tons of Aluminium is required to complete the whole of the additional Rigid Airships proposed,(b) That the skilled labour required in building Airships is mostly supplied from female labour.The enlarged supply of both Aluminium and Duralumin in this country is due to the initiative and foresight cf the Admiralty in December 1915, ?/hen they arranged with Munitions for large increases of Aluminium and were directly instrumental in enlarging the only Duralumin works in this country from a capacity of under six to over sixty tons a month.       Less than a quarter of this latter amount of Duralumin is now used by the Admiralty for all purposes.I would point out that the programme of Airship construction should not interfere with the programme of aeroplane services as the labour required fcr the one is different to that required for the other; and even if labour1 ?/ere diverted from Airship construction now, it would be a considerable time before it would be sufficiently trained to be of any use in aeroplane construction.     The Minister of Muntiions&apos; argument might Y/ith equal relevance be used against Warship labour.With regard to the statement that a great risk is being run of spending labour and steel in 1917 and 1918 upon the erection of sheds for airship construction ( which when 1919 comes may be discarded in favour of the needs of aeroplane warfare), this is clearly only the opinion of the Minister of Munitions and is in every way refuted by the usefulness (based on past enemy experience) anticipated from these Rigid Airships when they are constructed.     The Admiralty War Staff have repeatedly pointed out that they consider one effective Rigid Airship to be equal to six Light Cruisers, and judging by the use made of these aircraft by the Germans in their legitimate apheres of usefulness, this is fully borne out.As submarines grew in size and radius of action, so their operations will continue to extend to greater distances from the coast and far out into the Atlantic, where these Rigid Airships should be of the utmost value for convoy work and submarine scouting etcEven if the war does not last until 1919, still the Airship Construction must go on as. the Rigid Airship is undoubtedly a necessary adjunct to the Fleet, and as it has every prospect of improving year by year, it is esser.Ua..&apos;J that this industry should be kept alive and fully developed in this country.
At the Battle of Jut3.an&amp; and cn several other occasions submitted to the War Cabinet the deplorable lack of such Airships has produced its inevitable results.The Admiralty have already agreed to a very much reduced programme which, in the considered opinion of the War Staff, for the minimum requirements for the Fleet, The Commander-In-Chief, Grand Fleet; is continually asking for Lighter-than--Air craft to operate with the.Fleet and no semi-rigid or non-rigid craft is capable of fulfilling these duties satisfactorily,(Signed)GODFREY PAINE.(Commodore)*
