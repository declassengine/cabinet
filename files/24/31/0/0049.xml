228E G- 5490 a j I 2 e 1!CL SERVICE 3YIF3    PARIS r,(IJoto by Lord Milner,)Tho attached klnuts has been sent to me in the absence of General bnuts, by the Secretary of the Air Board,    I think e decision should be given by the Cabinet on the proposal as soon as possible,Personally I feel that the disadvantages which are pointed out in the letter are so great that it would be impossible to start the suggested Service at present.3 Whitehall Gardens, 3.V;. 9th November, 1917,Minute from Secretary, Air Board to Lord Milner.Lord Milner.Monsieur Flandin, a member of the French Chamber of Deputies and Secretary of the French Interdepartmental Committee on Civil Aeronautics, has come to London to pro-pose a Government postal service by aeroplane between London and Paris.A similar project put forward by Messrs. JReuters, Limited, was recently under the consideration of the Air Board and ?.as rejected on the ^round that it was inadvisable in the present circumstances to divert any part of the aerial resources of the country from the pressing- needs of the Air berviees0Monsieur Flandin was informed of this attitude before he came to -uondon, but the French authorities nevertheless persist in their project v,&apos;hich has received the approval of the trench .?rime Minister., They say that if the English Government is unable to provide pilots and machines these will be furnished entirely from French sources.    They only ask in effect permission to land at an aerodrome near London, the provision of the necessary she.-is and the motor service for transporting the mail from the aerodrome to the post office.(Initialled)M.
The Air Joard have given the matter further consideration and 8re of opinion that it should he submitted through you to the &quot; sr Cabinet.   They see the following objections to tne .,ro -osal.. There might bo considerable criticism of the employment of pilots at tho present time on a purely peace service/  If, as the French suggest, the pilots in question would bo mon who had become unfit for service at the front, it would still be objected that they might be employed in training pilots or in testing aero Planes.Even if the machines which the French propose to assign to the service are unfit for use on the front, they mi  lit still be used for training, if not by the French at. least by the Americans,The Trench machines engaged on the service would have to cross over our coast defences, and, owing to the possibility of their being mistaken for raiders, this is likely to ^ive rise to difficulty.The enemy would urobably soon discover that this service had been established, the;; would endeavour to attack the aeroplanes conveying the mails, and a demsnd for a orotective escort would arise which it might be difficult to refusea    In the absence of protective measures only unimportant matter could be conveyed by the aerial mail, which would run considerable risk of destruction.Our own contribution to the service would certainly not in practice bo limited to. the provision of facilities for lending, etc., we should be called upon to provide petrol, to recover machines which had met with an accident and had fallen in British terri-tory, and so forth.Our own experience shows the extreme difficulty of maintaining &amp; regular service to France.   British machines urgently required at the front are constantly held up for many days at Lympne owing to weather conditions.The most serious objection, however, is no doubt that it v/ould be highly undesirable to allow a service of this kind to fall into the hands of the French exclusively.,    Our own manufacturers show a certain . restiveness at having their activities confined strictly to war work;   they constantly seek facilities for advertising themselves at home and abroad with a view to civil work after ohe war tnd draw unfavourable comparisons between the facilities for advertisement which have been granted to them, and, e.g., to the Italians ?nd French by their res jeetive Governments, in this connection.    There would certainly be sn irfe-ivistible demand for the  jarticioation of British machines in this service if it is once allowed to be established;    such Mirticioaticn could only be at the cost of the output required to meet our own war requirements, and if iiritich machines oarticioated in the postal service, British pilots would also have to be furnished.
For these reasons it is thought&quot;that assent should not &quot;be given to the French proposal..But it may be that an Aerial Postal Service between London and Paris would prove a very popular measure and it is for the Cabinet to decide whether there are grounds fo;;- adopt jug it sufficient to outweigh the disadvantagew indicated above,(Signed)     II, ?* HARVEYcSecretary to the Air xSoard.,Board,
