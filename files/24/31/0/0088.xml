rThis Document is the Property ofHis Britannic Majesty^ Government.)MEMORANDUM/Oon-views of Kuhlmann and Gzernin on the situation.441(From a usually reliable correspondent).25th October, 1917.&quot;$he following is a summary of the more interestingparts of a conversation with a Hungarian, who has just returned from a monthVs stay in Germany and Austria-Hungary.     He is in close touch with Austrian and German diplomacy and a trusted friend of Dr. v. Kttblmann, whom he met in Berlin during the last week of September.Dr. v. Kuhlmann^ view of the diplomatic situation seems to be this:The Allies are bo entangled that any proposition tending to a general peace must of needs be creative of jealousies and aiscord.    For this reason it seems impossible for the Central Powers to submit a eut-and-dried scheme, but they must try and convince at least one of the leading Powers of the Entente that their desire for peace was sincere as long as peace could be obtained without putting Germany in the position of a beaten Power.     Personally he would prefer to get in touch with England.     This, however, seems impossible. British statesmen seem to have lost their sense of reality; their policy is dictated by emotion and by the desire to show up EnglandTs superiority.     If Germany wished to have peace now - and peace there will be before Christmas - one must not count upon England.     There is a current in Germany, a currenti&amp;at is powerful both from a politioal and an economic view, which is in favour of a peace through France.    Personally he was rather sceptical, but if a peace could be obtained upon the conditions: which the leaders of this current believe France would accept, then he would most certainly not stand In its way.
lo allow France concessions in Alsace-Lorraine in exchange for the Baltic provinces in Russia, was a business proposition which no responsible statesman could refuse to entertain.     So far he had avoided committing himself to this plan because he aid not believe it feasible.     Yet he thought that peace was bound to come through France.     His information as regards the political situation there was encouraging.    Poincare&apos;s position was shaken.     The next few months may bring about his downfall, but they will certainly produce a radical change of feeling in the Chamber.    France is ripe for peaoe. the more so as they bad every reason to believe that the Russians will make it quite olear to their French friends that Russia had every reason to wish for a speedy peace and none to continue fighting.    All they have to do is to prepare forcible arguments in Russia and to show the Italians the futility of their efforts.     Doing this, and keeping in touch with the French movement, will bring us peace within the next few months.As to the domestic situation in Germanyt Ktihjmann seems to be sincerely for democratic progress.    He felt sure that he would be called upon to assume the responsibilities of the Chancellor not later than in November.    The only obstacle in his way he thought to be his Bavarian origin, but he felt sure of the Kaiser1s favour and of his popularity with some of the progressive parties.     Even he would not go as far as to propose a Parliamentary Govern-ment which, given the growing power of the working-classes, would paralyse German industries as it did in England.     The whole power of tho State must be used in the interest of German industry, this being the only way to save Germany from a finan-cial collapse and at the same time to provide for the working olasses.    Euhlmann complained that the very industrial people^ for whom he cared most misunderstood his intentions because he refused to commit himself to their aanexationist theories.
But if he got for Germany the possibility of free competition all over the world - and this he meant to get - this would count for much more than Belgium ever could.     He was not afraid of any serious disturbances in the Reichstag.     Some formal concessions will go a long way to appease discontent suoh, for example, as consulting the Parties as to the appointment of the Chancellor and of the principal Secretaries of State.     But what was urgently needed, and what he considered the most impor-tant measure, was the Prussian franchise reform.. He did not think it wise openly to discourage the annexationist movement.     It is powerful, and, if kept well in hand, very useful in keeping up the moral at the fro&amp;t as well as in making the Entente moderate as to their aims.     Only they must not be allowed to dictate and to impose their views upon the Foreign Office.     He treated them in a very friendly but non-committal way, and he thought he had them in hand.     He was on the best of terms with the army leaders;   careful not to touch their sense of importance, but always aware of the histori-oal fact that it was Bismarck and not Moltke who dictated the terms of peace.     He felt pretty safe, and certain that he would be in office at the time of peace negotiations.Etuhlmannfs statements as to the relations between Austria-Hungary and Germany are not worth reproducing.     They are the usual platitudes a German v/ouldt say to a Hungarian. But it is worth mentioning that Suhlmann considered the personal conflict between the Kaiser and the Emperor-King Charles a very grave one and that he proposed to spare no effort.at bringing about a reconciliation.     He further acoentuated his sincere sympathy with Count Caernin, and his (Kttblmahn^)view, that the economic relations between his country and Austria-Hungary oould not remain as they were prior to the war.    He admitted that the unofficial Middle-Europe scheme contained some fantastic features, but he had no doubt that Austria-Hungary and Germany
-4- - 444will have to show at least a united economic front towards foreign countries, whatever their tariff-relations may he between themselves.     This peftslbit point he could not help pressing because a similar principle had already been agreed upon between Germany and Turkey and Bulgaria, and if Austria-Hungary were to refuse her adherence, the other agreement would be devoid of any practical value.     He was sorry to see that the Vienna Foreign Office was still reluctant to accept Germany^ point of view, but he believed he would succeed in persuading Vienna that the Austro-Hungarian apprehensions were perfeotly groundless.My friend has had an opportunity of reporting this part of KtLhlmaru^s conversation to Count Czernin, who expressed bis doubt as to Ktthlmaiu^s ability to convince him of the sound-ness of the German arguments.In Vienna the situation is not different from whatJ have heard, and reported, before.     The war-weariness isincreasing, though there is an unmistakable current among theGerman Parties in Austria and the Tisza and Andrassy groups inHungary to start an annexationist movement.     There is no doubtthat this current is being inspired by the Germans, to be moreexact by the Kaiserfs own family, his brother-in-law^and his(2)bou (August YJilhelm) as well as his son-in-law,   being frequent guests in Vienna and Budapest without, however, having any offi-cial connections with the Vienna Court.     The Kaiserrs relatives see much of responsible statesmen and party-leaders, and this fact has already been unpleasantly noticed by the Jtaperor^-King and Count Gzeroin.    There is, however, no possibility of prevent-ing those visits, for which there is always a pseudo-official explanation in connection with military missions to German army representatives in Vienna and Budapest;   but their real aim(l)   The Duke of Holstein. (2)   The Duke of Brunswick.
seems to be to make an under-ground propaganda for the Central Europe scheme and for the annexation by Hungary of certain parts of Serbia, especially of Belgrade   which is pointed out as a lasting menace to Hungaryls peace.According to my informant, who is not an independent observer, and only capable of reporting what he had been told, the economio situation in Germany and Austria-Hungary is better than it was last year.     In Germany the question of food is oausing less anxiety, only fat and butter being still very soaroe.    The war-spirit seems to be increasing in Germany and the possibility of an American landing in Europe is generally disbelieved.     He told me the usual phrases about the U-boat possibilities, and other current gossip, which is not worth reporting.     But I think it of interest to reproduce parts of his interview with Count Czernin, who was less sure of a speedy peace than his colleague in Berlin.     He saw Count Czernin at the end of last week and then the Austro-Hungarian Minister said he had done everything in his power to arrive at a reasonable understanding, and he could do no more.     He was not an annexa-tionist, but if Austria-Hungary had to sustain another winter-campaign, which he would have liked to avoid at the price of sacrifices, he would certainly revise his conditions and make the Serbians and Rumanians pay the costs.     He was perfectly convinced that Austria-Hungary would be in a better strategic position in the spring, and that the proposed offensive against Italy would free the Monarchy from the last remains of hostile occupation.     Then, with the enemy at a distance of hundreds of kilometres beyond any one of the Monarchy!s frontiers, the troops might be given several months rest.     The population were convinced that the Emperor-King and his Ministers did their best to obtain peaoe, and it was just the futility of their efforts which had shown the Austro-Hungarian peoples that the Entente were really bent upon dismembering the Monarchy.

-6-448The more the people are imbued by this conviction, the more intimate the bond between the tstynasty and the peoples is bound to become.     On the other hand, even those nationali-ties, like the Czechs, who were playing the game of the enemy, seeing themselves confronted with the fact that Austria-Hungary knew how to defend herself and that no help from the Allies could be expected, will be less hostile to a lasting solution of their problems than they had been so far.     He would gladly meet any sign of an advance from the enemy, but he would take no more steps to provoke it.Count Czernin was very sceptical about Dr. v.Kfihl-mann&apos;s statement in regard to Prance.     He said he was sorry to see his Berlin colleague in the company of Count Michel Karolyi, who was nursing the same delusion.     France would never betray an Ally, and it was not in the interest of Europe that she should do bo.     There are only two possibili-ties.    Either a general peace to be initiated by two of the belligerent Powers - one of each side - who trust each other;   or a prolongation of the war till Europe finds x^erself in the middle of a general revolution and anarchy caused by famine.     He did not believe in a decision on the battle-field.&quot;
-i- 447The foregoing report has been received from a reliable correspondent;   it is circulated because of its intrinsic interest;   while it would not be wise to base an absolute dependence upon iJT, for in ell cases ^second-hand record of what was said in conversation must be used with great discretion, in its general outlines it probably gives on the whole a fairly correct presentation of the matters with which it deals.The conversation with Baron Xtihlmann gives a singu-larly interesting picture of his attitude of mind, and one that is in accordance with all olse that is known of him.     Ee ap-pears as a man full of resouroo and full&apos; cf confidence in hie own cleverness, who aspires to settle both the external.and the internal problems with which the German Government is confronted, by clever &quot;diplomacy?    It is a purely opportunist policy;   one which does not appear to be &quot;based on any firm principles.    Ee sees that to bring about a conclusion of the war which would be in any way satisfactory to Germany, it is necessary to get one of the Allies to begin separate negotia-tions;   it is indifferent to him which it shall be;   he would prefer England, doubtless because she is the strongest of the enemies of Germany, and also because, owing to his residence in this country, he feels himself more at home in dealing with England, but France would do almost as well, and if France is difficult, then he will use Eussia to put pressure upon France and, speaking just before the. offensive in Italy, he is confi-dent that they oeuld foroe the Italians into negotiation or submission.The reference to Alsace-Lorraine is interesting; some would suggest that it was impossible for him to have used the language attributed to him as it appears to be inconsistent
with his public declaration, on this point and, moreover, it would run counter to the intense national feeling which any proposal for concessions in Alsace-Lorraine would arouse, lone the less it  ay very Likely be correct.    There is a world of difference between surrendering any portion of Alsace-iorraine as a condition of peace imposed by a victorious enemy on a beaten Germany, and coming to a compromise on the matter in the way of a bargain for acquisitions elsewhere, with the object of making possible better relations towards France in the future.   &apos; Whatever public feeling in Germany may be, any far-sigl\$ea German statesman, looking to the future, oould not refuse to recognise that it would be worth while to sacrifice something - even a portion of Alsace-Lorraine - in order even-tually to make possible an entente with Prance, and Ktlhlmann is quite capable of underestimating German national feeling just as he does that of other countries.For his weakness seems to lie in this - that he does not recognise that he is faoe to face with national passions and convictions which cannot be dealt with merely by cleverness in negotiation.    He obviously does not appre-ciate how deep-seated are the feelings of hostility which have been aroused against Germany during the war, both in England and in France, and attributes them, as so many Germans are apt to do, merely to the influence of individual political leaders; in the same way he probably completely underestimated the forces which compelled this country to take part in the war, and be-lieved that he would be able to avoid this by clever manipula-tion of the English Press.The same weakness is shown in his reference to the internal situation in Germany.     He &quot;seems to be sincerely for democratic progress&quot;, but &quot;he would not go as far as to propose a parliamentary government&quot;.     It is difficult to see what form
democratic progress can take in Germany unless it is in the direction of parliamentary government.     All seems to him to depend on the reform of the Prussian Franchise, but is it to be supposed that if such a reform took place and it brought with it, as it must do, a large Liberal and Socialist majority in the Prussian Lower House, that this majority would be satis-fied with anything less than parliamentary control?    But par-liamentary control in Prussia would necessarily overthrow the monarchical system in the Empire, which ultimately depends on the fact that under the working of the present constitution the Reichstag is powerless against a monarchical Prussia.     He prob-ably quite misunderstands the strength of the democratic move-ment.Like all modern German statesmen who try to imitate Bismarck, he is ready to pursue half a dozen inconsistent poli-cies at the same time;   but these men seem to forget that BiBmarck was opportunist in his means but adamant in his ultimate alms;   he united great diplomatic skill with the power of leader-ship, and when necessary, never feared to challenge his opponents end fight the struggle out to the death.     That which Germany is at this moment wanting is a statesman who has the courage to put great principles before his country and will not shrink from unpopularity in order to attain them.     Etthlmann shows no sign of this quality, and therefore the easy confidence which he professes will probably meet with disappointment in other ways, just as his easy confidence that he will be Oban-cellor before the end of November is probably - we oaunot say certainly - destined not to be fulfilled.It will be obvious that the programme which he puts forward, both at home and abroad, would, in his opinion, if it were fulfilled, insure the perpetuation of the present system by which Germany was supreme in Europe, Prussia in Germany, and the Emperor in Prussia.     There would be a few small and
superfioial changes at home which, as he thinks, would leave the essential workings of the Constitution unchanged;   there would abroad be every appearance of a desire to meet the reason-able wishes of other states, but no change in those essential things by which the situation is now governed.i The account of the relations between Germany and Austria Is valuable, and is borne out by information which oomos from other sources.    Kuhlmann visited Budapest on Oct. 21, and went on,from Budapest to Vienna.     The very well-informed cor-^Tespondent cf the Neue ffreie Prosse tells us that important conversations took place between Kflblmann and the leading Hungarian politicians;   Kiihlmann was in a position to give an jwap uncommonly satisfactory picture of the general diplomatic and military situation;   this was confirmed by his impressions in Sofia and Constantinople;    the military and political fronts of the Central Powers continue united and unassailable;   they have the initiative both strategical and political;   there was complete harmony between Herr von Kuhlmann and Count Czernin; &quot;special stress was laid on this factor&quot;.     The visit tc Buda-pest would show him that the Hungarian portion of the united front was equally sound;   that here also there was a groat and gonuine desire for an honourable peaco, but in the case of necessity arising from the policy of the enemy, the Central Powers were determined to fight through to the end.lith regard to Count Karolyi, we are told that at a reception given after a banquet in honour of Herr von Xuhlmann, the conversation turned chiefly on economic matters.&quot;After dinner was over the guests retired to the reception room where a keen debate took place on froeign policy.   Herr von Kuhlmann talked at length with Count Karolyi.    Afterv/ards a general discussion followed, in the course of which C;unt -. Karolyi explained his political views, which differed from those officially held.     Count Karyoli spoke against the arrangement of the Powers in groups and stood up for coalition fVereinigung) of all European States.
Another account tells us:&quot;Count Michel Karolyi opposed the JSafcmann idea of a Central tor ope, and the former Finance Minister, TeleBzky, gave ex-pression to his interesting view on future economic policy. Ssterenyi, ex-Under Secretary for Coimaeree, pointed cut that the economic approximation between the Monarohy and the German BkqfcAre was from the beginning free from all aggressive ten-denoy.     In the solution of the question of this approximation eyery form must be avoided which touched the sovereignty of the two States and care must be taken that the approximation did not have any further aggressive tendencies.&quot;Thereupon Dr. von gttblmann explained he must protest against every opinion as though Germany in economic matters would only think of taking up an aggressive position after the war against States which are at present hostile.    Germany, on the oon-trary, stood m the standpoint - and in this he knew that he was at one with the Government of Austro-Hungarian Monarohy -that an eoonomio war after the war muBt be regarded as oom-pietely excluded.   Every attempt must be made to restore the old communications after the war as far as was possible, and to render possible an economic relationship of the States. Nothing would be dons whioh would help development of an oppo-site tendency.11&quot;In the further course of the dieoussion Dr. von KShlmann expressed himself with fullest recognition about the Premier, Dr. Wekerle.     Ee described him as a practical statesman of the old school, who did not, as many modern statesmen did, carry on politioal business on an unfirm foundation.    He das-cribed Count Ozernin as a strong personality (einen ganzen Mann) of independent views and conceptions.These accounts are confirmed, though not in a precise form, by what has Inqipx appeared In the German press.We see then the same endeavour to ignore real points of difficulty and difference, to be friends with all parties, even those who ,are radically opposed to one anothear.    To be agreeable equally to Austrians and to Hungarians;   tf establish close economic union with Austria-Hungary, but at the same time to make this appear as though it had no point directed against other European States.     To carry out in practice the c&amp;noeption of Mittel-Europa,while eliminating from it in appearance those aspects which inevitably produced ameng the Allies the reaotion of the Paris Conference.     The repeated stress laid on the good relations with Count Czerhin will be netioed and with the light thrown upon this by information given in the attached document, we can easily believe that in this matter JCuhlmann knows that ornrything is net quite so eaEy as he would wish.
With regard to Karyoli, it will be remembered that he is the leader of the Minority &quot;Independence&quot; Party, which carried out the traditions of Keesutfc and desires complete independence for Hungary,as against the &quot;Independence&quot; Majority which is led by Count Apponyi, and who are the supporters of the present Hungarian Government.    Count Karolyi is a genuino democrat, an idealist and a believer in the League of Nations;   he is not in refclity a man of great force or Influence, &quot;a parliamentarian with a stutter&quot;.    The Majority, though in varying degrees, wish to maintain the German alliance both political and economic Karolyi would wish to see Hungary an independent democratic State in a united and pacific Europe;   he Is therefore strongly opposed to the Naumann conception of Mittel-Buropa;   before the war he desired an understanding with Russia and he of course would welcome anything which would restore relations with Pranae. A compromise on Alsace-Lorraine would restore the possibility off relations with France, would do away with the separation between Eastern and Western Europe, and by bringing Prance into friendly relations with the Oentral iiuropean States, would give a support against German predominance.It is/characteristic cf Ktthlmann that, while profess-ing the olosost friendship with Ozernin, ho will at the same time establish relations with statesmen whose objects are radically inconsistent with the maintenance of the present Austro-Hungarian Monarchy.9.11.17.Department of Information, Intelligence Buroau.
