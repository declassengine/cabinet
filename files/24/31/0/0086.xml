Translation of a document received from the 2nd Bureau of the French General Staff.
CThfs Document Is the Property ofHis Britannic fvlajesty?s Government.)2nd November, 1917.British Military ^lesion, Paris.Italian defeat and Public opinion29 th October, 1917.l^^mQ German attack and the sudden defeat of the Italian troops have evoked throughout Italy a feeling sore of surprise than of panic.&apos;ihe advent of the Germans on the Italian front, so often announced but never realized, had passed almost into the legendary stage.    It was no   longer believed and in certain industrial centres, notably in Elian and Genoa, it was very confidently believed that Germany would always treat Italy with consideration.In the face of the accomplished fact there is astonishment and indignation, tout the menace of German occupation does not appear to have aroused any feeling of hate.    A tradesman declared to one of our agents 8 if unhappily they succeeded in entering Milan, I am persuaded that they would not commit any damage, they have too many interests here.&quot;On the other hand, no excuse is made for the Army which is openly   condemned.    It is related in Milan that the communique of the 28th October beginning with these words * the violence of theattack and the lack   of resistance of part of the second Army.....*is a modification of the real original text.     Cadorna,s communique; on the contrary was framed in the following terms 8 The violence of the attack and the Ignominious conduct of the Second Army ........&quot;22ie reasons generally given for thfcs cowardice on the part of the Army are as follows:A.    Fault of the Supreme Command in not knowing how to apportion the forces.
ffce fighting line has always been the same for two years and a whole army of 9eribusquestt in uniform or of men wearing the exempted badge is jsaintained in rear.socialist propaganda.     he official socialists have worked on the men on furlough for the last 7 or 8 months,    Shy were led to believe that the war would never end if the soldiers themselves did not force the Governments to yield.    Tho method usually advocated was wnot to refuse to obey, but fcEfc surrender at the first opportunity.*   This is what they did.   The results of this propaganda have been patent for some months and had affected pretty deeply the Junior officers.taken prisoner) expressed a current sentiment.   On the 80th October at Florence, one of our agents talking to a 2nd Lieutenant of 19 years of age who was starting for the front the following morning, heard him pronounce the following statement &quot;if 1 can get taken prisoner, like   my brother, I can only dooroo myself lucky.   It is anyhow better than spending a whole winter in the snow, especially as officer prisoners are not treated badlynA young doctor of the rank of Captain, in charge of a hospital near Gorisia, who returned from the front a fortnight ago, paid a visit to a friend, a chemist, well known for his advanced opinions, and talked to him as follows?tt ... .you know, I am a socialist myself now.   We must end this existence,   we shall not attack any more, and all the better, for we are quite determined to surrender.   The war can only end by this means.18It should be noted that the socialist propaganda had been so intensified in the army latterly, that a soldier affirmed to us that he had himself seen in the war sons, placarded on the walls the famous notice &quot;no winter in tho trenches&quot;C Olerioal propaganda. The country priest especially is working steady demoralization.   The Italian peasant likes to confesshimself
himself when he returns from the front, and almost regularly he istold by the priest.......if only there were anything to &quot;be gainedby It. But it is really finished and is only making the poor suffer unnecessarily. The prisoners at least will return someday .... but as for the others i *D. Total exhaustion of the Italian soldier who will no longer listen to anything and no longer cherishes any ideals *III.A state of confusion is the result of these facts.   Public opinion is looking for the culprits but does not know exactly whom to accuse.    The different currents of opinion may be summarized thus: 1.   The majority who is blaming the Government and accuses It of weakness and lack of foresight and organization. The coincidence of the ministerial crisis with this disaster is a source of irritation. 2.   a fairly big minority ( no tally the Nationalists) throw the blame on C adorn a and accuse him of not having foreseen these defections, of not having informed the Government of them, and of not having under the threat of resignation insisted on severe repressive measures, against the disorganization in the army.In this connexion is to be noted the interpellation put forward this very day (29th October) by Mil FEDERZOM &amp; MEDICI, Nationalist Deputies, bringing a direct charge against Cadorna for hie communique above mentioned. 8.   The official socialists who clearly express views thus (quoting from a conversation withSenati of the &quot;Avanti&quot; )   &quot;It is unfortunate that Italy is the vietim but it is the only means of finishing the matter&quot;.It is as well to mention the attitude of a portion of the Italian Press which the last three days has been quoting large extracts from English newspapers, showing their sympathy for Italyand
and demanding that help he sent her.This attitude has had the result of turning public opinion in Italy which is always very impressionable in favour of England and of creating  the belief that salvation can be found only in her.
