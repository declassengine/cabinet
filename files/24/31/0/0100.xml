(This Document is the Property of JD PURCHASE OF THE LIQUOR TRADE-oulate the Report of the Liquor Trade Finance Committee for England which was presented to me a few days ago.     The attached summary &apos;^J^Mch has been prepared in my Department may be useful to the War Cabinet.I understand that the Reports of the Scottish and Irish Committees may not be ready for some time, and in view of the great public interest in the matter I -think it would be best that the English Report should be presented to Parliament and published at once.i Office, G. GAVE. 473th November, 1917.SUMMARY., 5-11).     1. The Committee have gone very thoroughly into the question of theinterests involved in and the financial machinery required to carry out a decision to purchase the liquor trade.     The terms cf reference pre-2.) oluded the Committee from entering into the questions cf social or financialpolicy invplved.2. Assuming as necessary a contrrl of the trade of such dimensions and character as to involve its purchase the Committee, in considering what 4.)        - interests should be acquired, proceeded on the principle of excluding interests the exclusion of which is compatible with the objects of the Government and with the protection of the State&apos;s monopoly in carrying on the acquired industries.INTERESTS TO BE ACQUIRED.Ill (l)).   3. The statute would vest in the State four main interests, viz:- (l)Breweries, with the freehold of their licensed premises and other trade properties,- (2) Free Houses, (3) the interests of holders of on-licences, and (4) the interests of holders of retail off-licences, but not the premises.4. Tho question of acquiring English Distilling and Rectifying concerns is left over pending the Reports of the Scotch and Irish Committees.     The businesses of Wholesale Dealers (with exceptions in special cases), maltsters 06-107) allied trades are excluded from purchase.     To deal with maltsters, anundertaking is suggested that for a period of years the Government should continue to supply its wants from its own maltings and from outside maltsters respectively in the same ratis in which the wants of the brewery trade were supplied at the time of purchase.5. As to Hotels, and similar border-line&apos;interests, the line of the Report 5*97,       is that it would not be necessary to acquire them, though power should beconferred on the controlling authority to regulate their trade administrat-ively, largely acceding to experience.     Sales of liquor in Hotels,
Restaurants and Railway Refreshment Rooms might, it is suggested, be limitedto bona fide guests or travellers, a moderate compensation being given if sub-stantial loss resulted;    but the business of public drinking-bars in hotelsshould be acquired.     As regards Clubs, compensation, if any, would depend     (Paras.1upcn the precise form of restriction imposed by the controlling authority.6. On these recommendations the State would acquire the retail distribution,whether for on or off-consumption, of all intoxicants, except in Hotels,Restaurants, Railway Refreshment Rooms etc. to guests or travellers, and inClubs.     It would also acquire the manufacture of beer, and possibly ofBritish spirits and their wholesale distribution.     The State would not as arule acquire wholesale businesses in wine and foreign spirits, and privatewholesale dealers in these commodities would also be able to buy such beerand British spirits as the State might be willing to sell them, for wholesaledistribution by way of export, supply to Hotels etc., and trade with privateoustomers in wholesale quantities.ADMINISTRATIVE MACHINERY.7. The statute would establish a purchasing body, in close relations with, if(Paras.3andnot a Department of the controlling authority, to conduct negotiations, and a tribunal to settle disputes.METHOD 0E PURCHASE.8. General formulae for the purchase of each of the main interests would be scheduled to the statute.9. These are designed to provide a basis for the settlement of cases by agree-(Paras. ment, and to define in other cases the issues referable to the tribunal. While provision is made for unrestricted reference to the tribunal at the instance of either party, the Report anticipates that agreement would fre-quently be attained, and that the issues before the tribunal would be definite, not at large.10. Stress is laid on the assistance which should be afforded in ^carrying out (Paras, purchase by the materials already collected by the Inland Revenue Valuation Department.11. The formula for Breweries is as follows:-Ascertain, normally on the trade from 1910 to 1914 and in accordance with rules to be prescribed, the true commercial profit of each concern on a freehold       (Paras, basis, i.e. before charging rents for leasehold properties;    capitalise, nor- (paras, mally at 15 years purchase;   scale down the result in proportion to the (pares,depreciation of capital values generally between the outbreak of war and the time of purchase, the precise ratio being fixed at the time of purchase;    and issue stock at whatever price of issue is justified by the denomination select-(Paras ed for the stock, having regard to the current rate of Government credit at the time of issue.     Stock so issued constitutes a corpus to be apportioned between
53,54) reversioners, the brewery, and beneficial tenants of the brewery as may beagreed by the parties or decided by the tribunal;   and the share allotted to the ,55-59,brewery is to be apportioned among debenture holders and shareholders roughly snd     according to a guiding formula suggested in the Report.     The right of debenture and other priority holders to full repayment preferentially to the holders of the junior securities is to be abrogated by the statute, ,25-29)This ssheme is analogous to, rather than in confliot with, that of the Samuel Committee.IE. The formula for Free Houses is the same as for breweries, except that no 76.)     normal multiplier is recommended, and the multiplier would have to be agreed by the parties or fixed by the tribunal in each case.13. The formula for holders of on-licences is that they receive (a) the value;.76-81 of their stock-in-trade and chattels, plus (b) not more than two years * purchaseiedule).of profits in the case of an annual tenancy and whatever larger number may be fair in the rare case of a lease with more than two years unexpired plus (c), if the State does not offer a paid post, a pension on a scale to be scheduled to the statute. If, as may occasionally happen, an on-licensed tenant has a beneficial leas?,he will in addition receive something out of the corpus of the freefiold.,,90-     14. The formula for holders of retail off-licences is the same as for on-licensed tenants, except that there is no pension and in the case of licences which have changed hands since 1902 the number of years&apos; purchase is not more than three, even if the unexpired term of the tenancy exceeds that period.PERIOD OF CONTROL.s.71-74)15. The statute would provide that from a fixed date the acquired concerns should be carried on for account of the State, the former owners receiving their pre-war income until purchase is completed, and that the stock forming the purchase, consideration should not be issued piecemeal to individual concerns as their price as ascertained, but in one operation at the end of the control&apos;3l)      period.     Provision is made, however, for immediate cash settlements withlicence holders desiring to commute for a lump sum their pension and compensation rights, where the amount to be paid does not exceed  500.COST.&apos;110).   16. The pre-war value of the four main interests to be acquired (excluding distillers and rectifiers, compensation for loss of occupation to licence-holders and to other persons engaged in the trade and miscellaneous compensation it ems) is estimated at not less than  350.000*000 gross.    This represents neither the grtcs amount of stock to be issued (since the pre-war values would have to be soaled down at the time of purchase in proportion to the depreciation of capital values generally since the outbreak of war) nor the net capital charge (since credits would arise from the sale of redundant properties).
17. While not discussing the probable return on capital or the general question -oi&apos; financial policy, the Report recommends the issue of a special inscribed stock redeemable at the option of the Government after 20 years, secured in the first instance on the surplus revenues of the aggregate acquired concerns and their assets and further by i.7ay of guarantee as to interest upon the Consoli-dated Fund.

TRADE FINANCE COMMITTEE (ENGLAND 4 ND WALES), 1917.REPORT.TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE SIR GEORGE CAVE, K.C., M.P.,His Majesties Secketary of State-for -jhe Home Department.I.-INTRODUCTION.1. This Committee was appointed on the 26th June, 1917, to enquire into the terms upon which the interests concerned in the manufacture and supply of intoxicating liquor in England and Wales should be acquired, and the financial arrangements that should be made during the period of control prior to the acquisition of such interests, upon the assumption that the Govern-ment may be compelled, as an urgent war measure, to assume control of the manufacture and supply of intoxicating liquor during the war and the period of&apos; demobilisation, and as a result of taking such control to purchase after the war the interests concerned.2. We have not therefore considered the questions either of financial or general policy involved in the purchase of the Liquor Trade, nor have we concerned ourselves with the question of control or management of acquired concerns after the completion of their purchase, except in so far as the terms of purchase might be affected and determined by the necessity of securing to the State full liberty in dealing with the property acquired and full protection for its monopoly in. carrying on the acquired trade.3. We realised, however, at the outset of our proceedings, that, in order to deal effectively with the question referred to us, it was essential that we should be informed of the objects and nature of the control, the assumption of which as an urgent war measure was anticipated by His Majesty&apos;s Government.;4. The Home Secretary, at our request, explained this matter to us, and we have in addition obtained from Lord d&apos;Abernon, the Chairman of the Central Control Board (Liquor Traffic), and some of the officials of that Board, full information with regard to the effect;of &quot;the measures of control already adopted, and the steps taken towards actually purchasing breweries and public houses. We have thus been able, in considering the possible exclusion of certain interests from anyscheme of purchase, to ask ourselves whether the control referred to would so&apos; far disturb&quot; or damage a given interest as to involve acquisition and not merely compensation, or whether the acquisition of such an interest would materially assist the attainment of the objects which His Majesty&apos;s Government have had specially in view.5. We have examined all aspects of the1 question and, in particular, have endeavoured to give every interest likely to be affected the opportunity of bringing before us its special circum-stances and point of view. ...6. We have been furnished with documentary and statistical material by the Central Control Board (Liquor Traffic) and the Commissioners of Customs and &apos; Excise and of Inland Revenue, and with the papers and reports prepared for, and issued by, previous Committees appointed to examine the subject, and have obtained through some of our members and other-wise such published matter as seems to bear directly upon State purchase as applied to the Liquor Trade in England and Wales.7. We took oral evidence from 50 witnesses on 17 days, and in addition have received a considerable number of written memoranda.8. Most branches of the Liquor Trade are organised in associations, both local and national, arid we invited the attendance of representatives from a considerable number of them.* .9. Several members of publicans&apos; associations, representative of all classes of licence holders, attended before us. . They stated their views with, much candour and ability. On the question of compensation for the suppression. of licences their general attitude was^that any scheme of State purchase would deprive of their livelihood many men who could not hope to find other occupations, and who ought therefore to,receive as compensation a substituted means of living. We have regarded this view as being rather a pointed way of expressing opposition &quot;to the whole policy of State, purchase than as a contribution to the financial question which com-pensation involves, and have therefore dealt with this part of the subject on other lines.
j10. With, one exception,, the various associations of brewers preferred not to send repre-sentatives. Fortunately, we were able to secure the attendance of-a number of professional, gentle-men of eminence as accountants and Valuers, who, though speaking only for themselves and hot as representatives of any interest, were from their long experience so fully able to inform us of the circumstances affecting the tirade in beer, that we regret less than we must otherwise have done the absence of members of s6me of the principal brewers&apos; associations. We feel fairly confident that, though not in possession of the wishes of the brewers at large, we are not to any great extent uninformed as to the trade interests involved.11. Various gentlemen have favoured us with schemes of purchase prepared on their own initiative. They offered many ingenious and useful features which were the outcome of con-siderable study of the subject. It must not be supposed that, because we have not actually adopted any of them, we have not found much in them which was suggestive and valuable.II -INTERESTS MAINLY AFFECTED.12. The interests which will be mainly affected, either directly or indirectly, by a purchase scheme, may be summarised as follows:  (a) Breweries, with or without tied or managed houses. (6) Free Houses.(c) On-Licensed Tenants.(d) The Wholesale Trade, concerned mainly with wines and spirits.(1) Importers and.Shippers (Wholesale).(2) Holders of Wholesale Licences selling to consumers.(e) Holders of Retail Off-Licences including Grocers&apos; Licences. (/) Distillers and Rectifiers.(g) Hotels and Restaurants.(h) Railway Refreshment Rooms, and holders of dining-car and passenger-vessel licences.(i) Theatres and Music Halls. 0&apos;) Clubs.(Jc) Subsidiary Industries, such as Maltsters, Bottlers, Engineers and others supply-ing raw materials, commodities and.implements used in the various branches of the Liquor Trade.(I) Cider-makers and makers of British wines. .       ) ;(m) Persons dispossessed of their employment, e.g., licence holders in or managers of tied houses, directors and employees.III.-THE BREWING TRADE.13. It is obvious that for England and Wales the brewing trade is the first subject for inquiry. The average annual production of beer in England and Wales for the three years ended the 31st March, 1914, was, in round figures, 31,160,000 bulk barrels. The total number of licensed premises of various kinds for the retail sale of intoxicating liquor is believed to be about 100,000, of which some 90 or 95 per cent, are tied to brewers or belong to or are managed by them.   Of these, about 20,000 are retail off-licences, and the remainder on-licerices.Brewers not for Sale.14. The number of licences granted to persons to brew beer not for sale was 5,567 in 1914-15. Beer &quot; not for sale&quot; is largely brewed on farms for the use of harvesters. Such brewing is not a business it earns no profit. Experience would show what steps the State would find it necessary to take for the protection of its monopoly, but it does not appear that the case of persons brewing &quot;not for sale&quot; calls for either purchase or compensation. &apos;7Breicers for Sale. .., ,   &apos;     :......15.   The number of licences to brew beer for sale in 1914 was 3,745; but as a single brewer may require more licences than one the number of concerns engaged in brewing was somewhat&apos; less.   Many of these concerns are private companies.   There is great variation between one concern and another.   Some breweries stand on very valuable sites; most of tbemare on sites -not more valuable than any part of the surrounding area, and there are many intermediate cases. Some concerns have tied houses, and some have none.   Some have many tied houses,: and. some, have few.   Neighbourhoods also differ, and their differences affect brewery concerns in various ways.   Where population is dense and the tied houses are near at hand, the distribution of beer is cheap, quick and simple.   Where population is sparse and thetied houses kre^eatteredj the: cost. of. distribution becohies a serious charge, especially as fbe, consumption will probably.-be low.    One district may be prosperous and improving;&apos; another stationary decline.   The people&apos;s demand for.beer may vary according to occupation, locality or social&apos; habits. ,Town differs from country, arid one town from another town. Some places have a special water supply.   Independently of tied houses, some concerns have a large family trade; others an&apos;
export trade of importance. Trade marks and trade names and long established reputations all possess their own peculiar features of profit.and of permanence. We only dwell on these familiar matters lest, in view of the nature of our recommendations, it might be conceived that we had overlooked or had shirked them. We realise that these variations are infinite. We believe nevertheless that there is a much greater uniformity amongst brewery concerns than might be supposed, and that a normal brewery concern is anything but a mere abstraction.16. There is, however, one feature, common to most brewery concerns of any magnitude, which, in the extent to which it has been developed, distinguishes them from all other trades. The tied house system links together retail distribution and wholesale manufacture, so as to collect in one hand the advantages of a well-organised trade, viz., certainty of a large and regular output, certainty of widespread and dependable outlets, and a product which enters largely into general consumption.17. It might seem at first sight that the real property of a concern should be valued separately from the trade part of the concern, and from this the conclusion might be drawn that no common multiplier of the annual profits could be adopted for the purpose of valuing the entire body of the assets as a whole.18. The purchase to he assumed, however, is the purchase of a going concern, and so long as the concern is carried on the real property assets cannot he taken out of it, as if they were to be disposed of separately. This could only happen upon a break-up of the concern and upon the hypothesis that the trade.can no longer be carried on. In such a case, the trade assets would have lost a great part of their value. If the vendor has the advantage of selling both together, what the former class loses in the number of years&apos; purchase attaching to it is to a large extent regained in the higher number of years&apos; purchase applicable to the trading element. Sites which, if sold separately for general purposes, would command a higher number of years&apos; purchase, may have to be measured by a lower number when treated as machinery for the sale of a particular commercial product and tied indefinitely to it. On the other hand, a trade which as a free trade competing with all the world would have a low number of years&apos; purchase, may deserve a substan-tially higher number because it is less exposed to competition and attains higher security through the tie of suitable premises to its manufacturing trade.   The vendor cannot have it both ways.19. Whilst there is a broad difference between real property and trading enterprise, and the security which each affords for the maintenance of profits, and it is useful and may be necessary in valuing concerns for the valuer to bear in mind the number of years&apos; purchase appropriate respectively to the real property portion and to the trade portion of the assets, we are of opinion that the ultimate problem is to merge both in a common multiplier which represents each in a common and permanent relation to the whole. To effect such merq-er and to select the right common multiplier is no doubt a task of some nicetv, but, as will be seen by the recommendations we make on the subject, we believe it to be right in principle and to be well within the capacity of practical and experienced persons broadly informed of the character of the individual undertaking.Possible Bases of Assessing Compensation..20.   There are several possible ways of computing the compensation payable to breweries under a purchase scheme.Assessments to Income Tax, &amp;c.21. It has been suggested that there are assessments and returns already in the possession of various public Authorities, upon which a simple and sufficient scheme oi purchase might be based. There are assessments-to Income Tax under Schedules A. and D., assessments to Excess Profits Duty, and assessments to the Poor Eate. In practice the standard of rating varies from district to district, and even from Union to Union. Rating cannot therefore furnish a uniform basis for-annual value with a view to purchase. This is&apos;true also, though to a less extent, of Schedule A. It has been the policy of the State to treat assessments to Schedule D and&apos; its extensions as private matters not to be used except for the adjustment or recovery of such taxes. Moreover, the statutory principles and rules applicable to Schedule D and its extensions proceed on lines which are not identical with those on which commercial profits should be ascertained, and the adjustments which this difference would involve would be of some complexity.Valuations under the Finance (1909-10) Act, 1910.22. The Inland Revenue Valuation Department is in possession of a great mass of material&apos;; Solw? f01* tne purpose ^of assessing the value of individual premises under the Finance (1909-iOj Act, 1910. This work has been carried a long way towards completion. It has been in the hands of expert valuers, who have devoted much time to it. Two of the officials of the Department have appeared before us, and have given us full statements of what has been done and of their views of what can be done. The information which the Department- has thus obtained is of great value, ns these valuations have been made, provisionally or finally, after separate inspection of each building and after examination of accounts and statements&quot;rendered by the parties concerned. It must, however, be remembered that they proceed upon a fixed statutory basis, that of market value as at 30th April, 1909, and that, although they have beeiroompleted in a. large proportion of cases, they have not yet become binding in more than about a third Thev proceed upon the method, commonly adopted for such valuations, of measuring the value of the
brewery in the value of the several tied houses, but they do not include the value of a free, family dr. export trade done from the brewery direct, which would therefore; still remain: to be ascertained in each case. Owing to war pressure, the total of the valuations of the separate premises has not yet been cast up, and we regret that we have been consequently unable to use it.23. The provisional valuations and the materials upon which they rest should be of great assistance7in ascertaining the valued of concerns for purposes of purchase; on the. other hand,; as they stand, they can hardly be accepted as. absolutely determining values for those purposes.Customary system of detailed inventory and valuation.24. Many of: those who have appeared before us have dwelt upon the superiority of the customary -system, of: detailed inventory and valuation as. the best plan for valuing brewery undertakings,: and some have asserted that it is the only way of-arriving at their true value. It is adopted iniippraeticeior ordinary transactions between vendors and purchasers in the way of transfer of particular undertakings, and in that: connection may be the&apos; best: We, however, have before us an operation, which is the converse of the ordinary way of such transfer, and the same witnesses have concurred in our view that, as applied to the universal purchase of the brewing trade in one operation, the customary method would lead to immense cost, friction and dispute and involve interminable delay. The number of competent and experienced persons avail-able for such work is small; the number required would be large if the work is to be completed within a reasonable time. We have felt, for the above reasons, unable to accept this method as one that would be practicable, at any rate for dealing with the purchase of brewing concerns and the licensed premises forming part of their assets.Capitalisation of commercial profit.25. The Committee which examined this subject in 1915 reported in favour of purchasing, at the average Stock Exchange prices quoted for the three years preceding the outbreak of war, the debentures and shares of those Brewery Companies, the whole of whose securities were so quoted. They recommended that when the total value of the securities of each of.those companies had been thus ascertained the number of years&apos; purchase of the annual net profits which it repre-, sented should be calculated, and that the number of years&apos; purchase so ascertained should be used as a guide in determining the appropriate multiplier of the annual net profits of other brewery undertakings, whether limited companies or privately owned concerns, regard being&apos; had to Stock Exchange quotations in those cases where some, but not all the securities of a company were quoted.26. As the number of brewery undertakings which have Stock Exchange quotations for the; whole of their capital is comparatively small, although it includes some of the largest and most important in-the trade, the method of arriving at values recommended by the 1915 Committee for the great majority of the businesses to be acquired really amounts to fixing a number of-years&apos; purchase of the net annualprofits as the normal multiplier, with adjustments for special circumstances and abnormal cases.27. After careful consideration the method which has commended itself to us also as the one most . equitable for arriving at the just value of a Brewery as a going concern is that of. capitalising the - true commercial annual profit that the business is normally capable of earning by multiplying it by a figure representing the fair market value of the security for the main-tenance of that profit.28. We have been able to go more fully into the matter than the previous Committee was able to do, and all the witnesses who have spoken as to the value of Stock Exchange quotations as a criterion of the real value of brewery securities have stated that, owing to the absence in many cases of a free-market and other- considerations, it would be unfair to take the quotations of ordinary brewery shares as representing their true value, although the same remarks would not apply equally to the quotations of well-secured preference shares, or even at all to well-secured debentures.. We have- accordingly arrived at the conclusion that we should recommend a definite number of years&apos; purchase as the multiplier for normal cases, instead of leaving that figure to be arrived at by investigating Stock Exchange prices only.29. The method which we recommend is that of capitalising the true commercial profit that a concern is normally capable of earning by a factor representing the value of the security for the maintenance of that profit. The difficulties of this method are less formidable than &quot;they appear, and are far from being insuperable. Exceptional cases may in practice need special consideration, but in our opinion this method is better than any of the-other methods that have been suggested. - ....-  . , Method of Purchase.30. We recommend the following means for giving effect to the system of valuation which we have decided upon.Purchasing Body.31.i The Statute which, any scheme of purchase would require should provide for a Purchasing; Body which should be empowered Mo call for any information from the vendors that may be . necessary to enable it to - estimate on prescribed lines the value of the concerns
to be purchased, with a view to arriving if possible at an amicable settlement with the vendors, Whether it should have any, and what, authority to negotiate with the vendors for a lump sum settlement, or&apos;other compromise, in order to expedite purchase and terminate uncertainty, is a matter of policy, but the7opportunity for such action would be provided by the communications which would precede any reference of the matter to the Tribunal, with the appointment and duties of wbich we deal later on (paras. 60-65). -:32. The Purchasing Body should have authority to call for properly authenticated accounts in forms to be prescribed under the statute, to have discovery and inspection of the vendors&apos; books in their discretion, and to&apos; obtain any information that may be considered necessary for ascertaining the financial position and the true commercial profits of the concerns, a.o as to reduce them to a common standard on a freehold basis. The accounts should contain such details as would enable accountants experienced in the liquor Trade to adjust the average profits of a concern during the datum period to a common standard of net commercial profit which would be applicable to all but exceptional cases.33.   The information to be given should include :  (1) A detailed Trading and Profit and Loss Account for each year in a form to be prescribed.(2) The Balance Sheets actually published and also Balance Sheets prepared in a formto be prescribed, as at the beginning of the datum period and as at the close ofeach financial year forming part of it. (3) An Adjustment Statement between the profits as shewn in the prescribed Profit andLoss Accounts and the figures shown in the published accounts. (4) A detailed statement of all debenture issues, mortgages and loans, with particulars ofthe properties charged and the terms as to redemption and sinking fund. (5) Particulars both of the licensed and of the unlicensed premises, shewing whetherfreehold or leasehold, and the cost, amounts written off, rents receivable, outgoings,book values and values for assessment to Schedule A. (6) Schedules of the fixed and loose plant.(7) Statements of the loans to tenants and investments outside the business. (8) Particulars of the stock and the method adopted for valuing it.Ascertainment of Commercial Profit.34. The profits would be taken before charging rent, income-tax or debenture interest, and the subject of the purchase would, as regards hereditaments, be not merely the vendors&apos; own interest but, in addition, when that interest is a limited one, the interests of all third parties in reversion. Otherwise, the State might be greatly hampered in any policy of concentration or suppression of the different acquired concerns by inability to renew a tenancy or to modify its fierms, or by the continued existence of obligations attaching to premises of which it desired to be relieved. The valuation and purchase&apos; being directed to the fee simple, the appropriate portion of the total consideration would be allotted thereafter in separate negotiations or pro-rteedings among the parties interested.35. We recommend that the 4 years 1910-11, 1911-12, 1912-13, 1913-14, be fixed as the datum period over which the annual profits of a concern would be averaged such datum period ta terminate in each case with the date in 1914 at which the concern in question was. aceustomed to make up its accounts.Our reasons for adopting this period are shortly as follows:  (1) These years form a fairly normal and complete period beginning with the operation, of the Finance Act, 1910, and ending with the passage from peace to war.(2) It would be inequitable for either the State or the trade to derive advantage in a compulsory purchase from the special and disturbing conditions resulting from the war and the legislation and control which the war has made necessary.36. Conditions arising only after the outbreak of war do not in our view constitute grounds for the modification of the datum period, but we think that an exception might well be made in cases where it can be proved that special circumstances occurring during the years that have been selected prevent them from being in any particular case a fair basis for ascertaining an average profit before the war.Multiplier for Capitalising Commercial Profit.37. The question of the selection of an appropriate multiplier representing ihe number of years&apos; purchase which, in a normal concern or in one reduced to a normal standard by adjustment of the accounts, would reflect the value of the security for the maintenance of the rate of profit ordinarily to be expected from capital invested in such a concern has engaged our most serious attention.38. We have considered the possibility of recommending a uniform multiplier applicable to all cases, as also the possibility of valuing hereditaments and liquid or trade assets separately, each with its own multiplier in every case. We have come to the conclusion that neither of these methods is calculated to attain the objeet we have in view, viz., that of finding a multiplier which would be fair in the case of a normal concern or in that of one reduced to a normal standard by adjustment of the accounts, and at the same time provide.on the one hand for circumstances affording exceptional security for maintenance of profits and for exceptional
4 J 0vtiI-vres&quot;wKethef in heredxtatoents,&apos; trade:marks*&apos;or.trade narnes, and. on the other; han^ for, unreal appearances-&apos;of-security or prosperity or for an approaching future of.dwindling t^de-jand dinimishing&apos;profits. . :  &quot;      &quot;:        u  c; v-ty    :\ . ;--/.-v,vt; .o. ,%osfjai^w39.- We have according]y adopted the principle of selecting; a multiplier which w&quot;e&apos;; believe would be fair&apos;in the case of a normal concern or in that of one reduced to a &quot;normal-&apos;st^nd^i&apos;d by adjustment of the accounts, but which would in exceptional cases be liable to be tfh&amp;elSfed or diminished&apos;in order to meet the special circumstances of a particular, concern. For the purpose in view, a normal concern may be defined as an undertaking reduced to a freehold bas^s, with maintainable and protected earning power equivalent to the average true commercialipoafit derived from carrying on the business in the datum period. -.&apos;;:.:-.;.&apos;..;)!40. It would be impracticable to enumerate all the different circumstances&apos; which niigTit justify a departure in the upward or downward direction from the normal multiplier,wbdt/-,:in our opinion, they might readily be reduced into classes, as we think that in somewhat varying degrees &quot;individual cases within these classes would possess common features sufficiently alike&apos;to bring them closely within common rules. - ... &apos;    :&apos;\41.   As examples of such classes, but not as exhaustively enumerating theni^we maysuggest:  (a) Exceptional sites of an annual value higher if not used for the purposes of a1 breweryor licensed premises than they possess when so used.(b) The extent to which the value of the real property owned in proportion to the totalassets is unusually high.(c) The extent to which assets are included which have not yet come into bearing or beenfully reflected in the net profits. ((Z) The small proportion of tied or managed houses owned by&apos;a brewery, or their absence altogether. .42. After carefully considering all the information before us, we have come to the con-chision that 15 years would, according to the standard of capital values prevailing.immediately before the outbreak of war, be a fair multiplier to be adopted in the case of the purchase of a normal concern, or in that of one reduced by adjustment of accounts to a normal standard on a freehold basis. In arriving at the above figure, we have made a full allowance for this adjust-ment of the accounts to a freehold basis, and also for the fact that the assumption by the State of the mononoly- of carrying on the Liquor Trade would impose upon the parties dispossessed a permanent disability comparable to a perpetual covenant not to compete, and. that vendors njay be put to some cost and trouble in changing investments. &apos;      &apos;    Jji43. The above conclusion that 15 years&apos; purchase of the true pre-war commercial p&apos;rofit.s,&apos;of the undertakings to be acquired represents their fair value as previously defined as at the outbreak of war does not of course imply that the amount so arrived at would be a proper purchase prpce, to be paid in cash if paid at the present time. Indeed, in arriving at their present cash value,&apos;&apos;it is clearly necessary to take into account the marked depreciation of the capital value qf;,all incomes, whether derived from real property or securities generally, which has taken plaee:;since July, 1914. This depreciation, which has operated in regard to all fixed interest and dividend-bearing securities, varies in the case of different classes of securities but is in all cases df very c onsiderable amount. The fall may in some cases be not quite so marked in regard to the ordinary shares of industrial undertakings generally, but it is nevertheless very appreciable in most tiftses-in which the post-war dividends are at the same rate as pre-war distributions. -:-       - &apos;^\ff44. It follows, therefore, that an income which on the pre-war basis of capitalization was worth 15 years&apos; purchase is at the present moment worth a much smaller number, i  ;...45. If the&apos; proposal were for an immediate cash purchase we should recommend that the basis should be such number of years&apos; purchase of profits as would be the present equivalent of 15 before the war... 46. Such a proposition may at first sight appear to involve hardship to the vendor. But such hardship is only apparent, since the smaller amount of cash to be received could under present conditions be re-inyested to produce a gross income of the same amount and haying equivalent security as the larger amount would have produced had it been invested before the war; wlijle the capital value of the securities which the larger amount would have purchased before the war is now correspondingly reduced by the general depreciation of capital values. &apos; .&quot;?47. If, on the other hand, it were proposed to effect an immediate purchase not for cash but by giving in exchange a Government Stock, we should recommend that the equation should be arrived at by ascertaining the present cash value of the undertakings on the above basis and issuing to the vendor such amounts of Government Stock as would if sold at current market prices-produce a sum of money equal to the present cash value so ascertained.Form of the Purchase Consideration. -      ,;jf.48..

interest with a correspondingly reduced price of issue might be more popular with the existing holders of brewery securities as offering an opportunity of recovery in capital value.50. Our proposals, however, do not involve the immediate exchange of brewery securities for Government Stock, but, as stated below, the carrying out of such an exchange at a future date, before which further changes in the interest yields of Government securities and in the standard of capital values generally are probable. We think therefore that it would be premature to lay down at the present moment any precise formula to govern the operation, and that the denomina-tion of the Stock to be issued, the price of issue and the amount of abatement to be made from the pre-war value.of the undertakings to be acquired in respect of general depreciation of capital values should be left to be determined in accordance with the actual conditions existing when the exchange comes to be effected.51. The purchase consideration should, in our opinion, be satisfied by the creation and allotment of a special inscribed stock redeemable at the option of the Government after 20 years, secured in the first instance on the surplus revenues of the aggregate acquired concerns and their assets, and further by way of guarantee as to interest upon the Consolidated Fund. A suitable sinking fund should be provided out of the surplus revenues of the acquired concerns after payment of the interest.52. Complaints might arise if the Stock were issued to vendors at different dates or on the final determination of the price in each particular case, and as we anticipate that all tho cases would be concluded before the completion of demobilisation brought the period of interim control to an end, we think that the Stock should be issued simultaneously to all the parties entitled to it.Apportionment of the Purchase Consideration.53. If the State is to acquire the assets, and to be free to deal with them as it may require, it will be necessary to fix a day after which debenture-holders are not to assert legal rights against tho:ie assets in specie. The assertion of such rights must be transferred to the purchase con-sideration. Where they are entitled to have their security realised, and have already taken effective proceedings for the purpose, their claim to full satisfaction out of the purchase considera-tion applicable to their security in priority to other parties should be recognised. For any case in which a receiver for debenture-holders is in possession, special provision will have to be made. Before the right? of debenture-holders, or other holders of priorities can be worked out, that portion of the purchase consideration which represents the purchase of the interests in real property vested in third parties outside the brewery concern must be ascertained and set $side. This portion should, in default of agreement between the parties, be calculated in the first instance by the officials of the Purchasing Body, with liberty to all third parties interested to appear before the Tribunal.54. If a sufficient amount to cover the aggregate of all such interests is once set aside and is secured, the determination of the rights of the holders of debentures and other priorities over the residue need not stand over pending the detailed ascertainment of the amounts due to the various third party interests, but may proceed independently.55. We think that in the apportionment of this residue two cardinal considerations must be borne in mind :  (1) A debenture-holder, unlike a mortgagee, is not in a position to claim repayment at par by giving a short notice to call in his money. Leaving out of account the rare case of short term debentures, the position generally of a debenture is that it is a loan for a long or an indefinite time, during which the lender cannot call in his principal, but can only realise his capital by sale of his individual holding. In practice, most issues of debentures are redeem-able only at the option of the borrower, and the money lent is only an income-producing invest -ment substantially secured, and it is commonly regarded in this light by investors of all kinds, including trustees. For the State to require a company to sell its concern when it did not seek to sell it, but meant, and was well able, to carry it on, and at the same time to leave the debenture-holders free to claim repayment of their capital in full, as if the business had been voluntarily given up or compulsorily liquidated on account of inability to meet obligations, would at present values give debenture-holders a premium which they never could have got if the State had not intervened.(2) As already stated, we think that the purchase consideration in the case of a brewery concern must take the form of an issue of Government Stock and not of cash. Between such a Stock and any brewery debenture there is and will continue to be a difference in respect of marketability and of security of income, which must always be in favour of the Government Stock. In the case of the best secured debentures it may not be large, but it is appreciable: in the case of the worst secured debentures it is great. The gradations between these two classes are numerous, and depend upon the terms of each individual issue and the circumstances of the borrowing concern. In no case can it be right that, as the mere result of the adoption of State Purchase, a present should be made to the debenture-holder of an improvement in his security which, if measured in money, would amount to an appreciable and even a handsome bonus.56. We therefore consider that any uniform rate would be arbitrary as a mode of expressing the ratio between the security of a single Government Stock and that of the several* debenture issues to be given up.   Neither can we now fix a scale of gradations expressing the relations
of various debenture issues to the Government Stock in terms of the security for the mainten-auee of the interest which they respectively afford. We cannot prescribe an arithmetical formula for the future computation of the relation which a Stock to be created hereafter under unknown conditions of credit would bear to existing securities which vary much now and may well vary more and differently then.57. We recommend the following arrangement as the best solution of the problem. As the Judders of the vendor company&apos;s issues of debentures and shares are the parties concerned in getting the residue of the purchase consideration distributed, the burden should be upon them to hold class meetings, and to agree if possible upon a scheme for their satisfaction out of the total residue, subject to the Tribunal^ confirmation. Failing agreement, any class should be at liberty to go before the Tribunal, at the same time citing the others to appear and assert their rights, and to ask the Tribunal to decide the distribution.58. The principle upon which the Tribunal should proceed is applicable alike to the various issues of debentures and the various classes of preference shareholders. It is that in lieu of the stock which they will surrender to be extinguished each class of holders shall receive such an amount of the new stock to be created as will yield the same annual gross income as they received in the datum period, subject to such a diminution of that average income as will, in the opinion of the Tribunal, under the circumstances affecting each issue or class, substantially counter-balance the superiority in the value of the security of the new stock which is to be allotted over that of the particular stock wdiich is to be surrendered and extinguished. Debentures which fall due for repayment at fixed dates or over fixed periods, whether the Company issuing them has or has not provided a Sinking Fund, possess, generally speaking, a higher value (which is reflected in a measure in Stock Exchange quotations when available) than stocks which are irredeemable or only redeemable at the Company&apos;s option. The liability of the Company to repay a fixed sum at a fixed date, and the existence of any funds specifically ear-marked for the purpose, should be taken into account in computing the present value of the debentures.59. It would be for the Tribunal to consider what materials, it should take into its cori-sideration, such as prices quoted for transactions effected on the Stock Exchange, or the prices at which actual transactions have taken place elsewhere, or other ascertainable data. We attach to this Report by Avay of Appendix a formula, together with an explanatory note, in regard to the distribution of that portion of the purchase consideration which accrues to the debenture-holders and shareholders of the vendor concern. It is not suggested that the proposed formula should be strictly adhered to in all cases.Appointment of a Tribunal to Determine Disputes.60. We recommend the appointment of an impartial Tribunal empowered to decide judicially any issues as to datum period, amount of true profit, appropriate multiplier, or otherwise which might ultimately be in difference between the vendors and the Purchasing Body, or any differ-ences that might arise with regard to the distribution of the purchase consideration between the parties interested. We think it essential that the Tribunal should have three characteristics:  (1) It should be independent of the Purchasing Body and its staff. (2) It should, in composition and procedure, be a business Tribunal. (3) It should act judicially, after hearing evidence and argument so far as might be necessary.61. Beyond this it is enough to say that it is to be hoped that it would conduct its business with the minimum of technicality. It would, of course, follow its own previous decisions, apply the existing law, and be guided by the documentary and other evidence1 before it, but, with the assistance of the expert staff which it would require, it ought to be able greatly to limit discussion of details and to simplify and shorten its proceedings.62. The Tribunal might, if necessary, consist of more-than one division, but these divisions should not be appointed for special localities or districts. All the cases of a particular class, wherever arising, should come before the same division, otherwise want of uniformity in the decisions might arise.63. There should be represented on the Tribunal legal training and experience, knowledge of valuation, and experience in the preparation of accounts and in general commerce and finance.64. There should, be an appeal to the High Court, but only by special case on specific questions of law to be definitely formulated. On questions of fact, the decision of the Tribunal should be final. We think that the allowance of costs should be in the discretion of the Tribunal, but should be treated as exceptional.and not as a matter of course.65.   Some machinery must be provided to deal with questions of fact arising upon claims of persons entitled to compensation for loss of employment.   Such claims might be dealt with either by a separate division of the Tribunal, or bv some other body appointed ad hoc    It is eminently desirable that sittings should be held in different oarts of the country for this purpose since the cases would often affect persons who could ill afford to come up to London.13690 . &apos;   i B2
The Scheme in actual, working.- 66 It will thus be seen that the method of valuation which we recommend for dealing with breweries in England and Wales consists partly of statutory regulations, partly of expert examination of the figures with or without consultation between the representatives of both Vendors and Purchasers, partly and finally of the presentation of any matters ultimately found to be in difference to-air impartial Tribunal for its determination.G7. In practice we should expect that, the statutory accounts having been dnly rendered, they would be examined by the expert assistants of the Purchasing Body, and the net average profit arrived at would be communicated to the vendors for their acceptance, comment or dissent. If the Purchasing Body took the view that a sub-normal multiplier was required it would state its ground, so too would the Vendors if they claimed a super-normal multiplier. We believe that agreement would frequently be attained, and increasingly often as the decisions of the Tribunal in the earlier cases become known and appreciated; but failing agreement, the ques-tions in issue would be submitted to the Tribunal, which after any necessary arguments would decide the datum period, the true net profit, the appropriate multiplier, or other matter in dispute, and so adjudicate a purchase price.68. The effect of the method of valuation which we recommend, would be that the State would acquire the entire assets of a brewery concern, stepping into its shoes as regards liabilities to creditors other than debenture-holders, in consideration of an issue of stock. Those interested in the old concern, the ordinary shareholders, preference shareholders, and debenture-holders, as well as the reversioners to the real property assets, would then stand entitled to the considera-tion, and would be dispossessed of their business and assets. Except under arrangements here-after specifically mentioned, all the assets are intended to pass to the State, including export trade, trade-marks, stocks, cash, book debts and secured loans.69. We think that except by mutual consent of both the vendors and the State no asset used in and for the purpose of the trade should be excluded from the purchase. In some cases, real property has been purchased with a view to some ultimate advantage expected to accrue to the trade, such as extensions of premises or the exclusion of competitors, though not yet yielding a trade profit; in otheTS, surplus funds have been employed in the purchase of real property or Stock Exchange investments. As to these, we think that, if special reasons can be shown for doing so, vendors should have the option to exclude them from the sale, the income derived from them as a factor in the calculation of the purchase consideration being included in, or excluded from, net profit according as the State does or does not acquire them. The State should have the option to exclude from the purchase assets not employed in the trade when they consist of easily realisable securities which could be distributed among the share-holders rateably without inconvenience or delay.70. Changes will have occurred in a brewery concern between the end of the datum period and the date at which control commences. We think they should be dealt with by means of two Balance Sheets; one would show the assets to be acquired and liabilities to be taken over as at the end of the datum period; the other would show the actual assets and liabilities existing at , the commencement of the period of control. Any increase or diminution arising in the interval would be apparent upon a comparison of the two Balance Sheets, and it would then be possible to compute the net sum to be added to or deducted from the total purchase consideration.Arrangements during the Period of Control.71. We assume that from the date on which it takes control the State would have pledged itself to rmrchase all the breweries and licensed houses. Much dissatisfaction and hardship would be caused if the action of the State in electing to suppress some concerns and to continue others should result in any pecuniary difference in the treatment of those interested. It would not be just that concerns which are continued should be left to trade on their own account, while those suppressed should have to look only to interest retrospectively paid on the Stock ultimately issued to them. No doubt some considerable time must elapse between the commencement of State control and the end of the process of ascertaining the purchase price for the whole of the concerns acquired. In order to avoid the disparities already alluded to, which might otherwise occur in the treatment of individual concerns, it will be better, in our opinion, to provide for this intermediate period by separate financial arrangements.72. As obligations to pay interest on debentures must be provided for, and as many persons whose money is invested&apos; in brewery concerns are wholly or partly dependent on the income derived therefrom, it will be necessary to make provision for maintaining the continuity of distribution to those interested, so far as possible, until the process of purchase is complete. We think that a day should be appointed (not earlier than the day to be fixed, as already recom-mended, for the transfer of debenture-holders&apos; rights against the assets of a concern to the corpus of the purchase&apos; consideration), which should fix the dividing line between the period in, which, in all cases, concerns are carried on for account of those interested, and that in which, in all cases, they will.be carried on for account of the State.73. We recommend accordingly that down to the appointed day the concern should be carried -m entirely for the benefit and at the risk, so far as earning profit is concerned, of the vendors. Whatever true profits they earned they would keep. After that day, anv profits earned would be earned for the State, and the State would pay, by suitable instalments&quot; to those interested in the concern an annual amount equal io the true average net profit ascertained for the datum period before mentioned, leaving them to satisfy debenture interest and pay dividends out of it.
74. Since any excess or short payments could be settled by deduction or addition at the time when the purchase consideration; is satisfied;, and since from a very early date enough would be known of each concern to make it possible to reckon the true net profits in question fairly closely, we think that there would be no difficulty in authorising those in control to retain out of the actual profits a sufficient sum for this pxirpose.&apos; Arrangements should part of the United Kingdom be excluded from the Purchase Scheme. 75.   In the event of a purchase scheme taking effect for England and Wales, but not for Scotland or Ireland, we think it would be necessary, nevertheless, to acquire licensed houses, stocks of liquor and branches of trade situate or carried on in England and Wales, though belonging to concerns in Scotland or. Ireland.IV. EREE ON-LICENSED HOUSES.76.   The purchase consideration of free on-licensed houses can be arrived at on the same broad principles as we have recommended for brewery concerns, though differences of method are involved.   The pre-war value of the freehold should be arrived at as follows.   There should first be ascertained the true rack rent calculated on the basis of the rent which the premises un-divested of the landlords fixtures and fittings would command if let in a free market under favourable conditions, the tenant paying rates, insurance and compensation levy.    This rack rent (which will not necessarily be the rent paid by the actual tenant) will as a rule be determined on the same principles as the Poor Rate or Schedule A Assessment, except that where the conditions are such that a property would command a higher rent upon lease than upon a tenancy from year to year, such higher rent should be taken as the basis for computation.   From the true rack rent so ascertained should be deducted mortgage interest, if any, and the balance should be capitalised by a multiplier appropriate to pre-war conditions; inasmuch as free houses vary greatly in character and situation, no useful purpose would be served by our recommending a normal multiplier which might well prove to be inapplicable in a large proportion of the cases; the multiplier must be agreed by the parties or settled by the Tribunal according to the actual circumstances of each case.   When the actual time of purchase arrives, the capital sum so ascertained should be scaled down proportionately to the depreciation of capital values between the outbreak of war and the completion of purchase, as already recommended in the case of breweries. The sum finally resulting constitutes a corpus to satisfy all the property interests, that is to say the freeholder and any holders under beneficial leases or tenancies, and should be distributed among them upon the principles recommended in paragraph 53 above; there then remains the per-sonal goodwill and chattel interest of the occupier, whether he is the owner of the premises or not.   Any profit which the trading occupier may be found to enjoy, after debiting, in addition, to all outgoings, (1) the difference between the true rack rent and the rent actually paid, (2) interest on capital, and (3) the value of his own services and those of unpaid members of his familv engaged in the business, may be regarded as attributable to his personal goodwill, and should be capitalised at not more than two years&apos; purchase in the case of a tenancy with less than two years unexpired, while in the case of occupational tenancies with longer unexnired leoSeq the additional securitv attaching to anv personal goodwill should be recognised by a suitable increase in the number of years&apos; purchase.   The resulting capital sum should be paid to the trading occupier in addition to any sum to which he mav be entitled out of the cornus ^ rm&apos;1^ o bp&apos;ne &quot;ial ^ns&quot; or tenancy, and his chattels and stock in trade should betakenover at a valuation. He will also receive, under our recommendations, compensation for loss of employment in accordance with the schedule, should no offer of equivalent service be made to him by the State.Y.-TENANTS OF TIED HOUSES.77. Licence-holders have certain property interests, chiefly stock-in-trade, utensils, furni-ture and fixtures, and also an interest in their licence, which, whatever its legal position may be, has in fact a real value, which varies with the personality of the individual. In addition, they may be regarded as old servants of the trade, who would have to look for a new occupation on its acquisition by the State.78. State purchase would involve valuation of and payment for the above-mentioned chattel-interests in the usual way. Compensatiion for the extinction of the licence is comparable to purchase of goodwill and should be measured by so many years&apos; purchase of the net profits made. In ascertaining those profits the licence holder should be debited in addition to rent and other outgoings with a fair sum for the value of his own services and those of unpaid members of his family, when employed in the business, as well as with ordinary wages paid, and also with interest on any capital involved. In the usual case of the tenant on annual or shorter tenure&apos;, or of a tenant on a lease for a longer term of which less than two years are unexpired, the number of years&apos; purchase of the net profits so ascertained should not, we think, exceed two. The compensation clauses under the 1904 Act provide that the licence-holder is to have not less than one year&apos;s purchase, although under them he has every chance of gettivo- a new licence elsewhere. The maximum of two &quot;years&apos; purchase of profits in respect of goodwill should not be regarded as applying to the case.of a tenant on lease with two years and upwards unexpired.79. Where a tied tenant holds a beneficial lease, his interest in the premises in respect of its unexpired residue should not form the subject of a separate assessment of compensation in his favour. It is really part of the interests acquired, when the assets of the brewery concern as a whole are purchased by the State, and, in distributing the corpus of the consideration among oarties interested, the Tribunal would put the appropriate value on this interest and satisfy it bsfore handing over to the reversioner his portion of the purchase consideration.
80. In respect of the loss of his accustomed occupation by reason of Siate purchase of the whole of the trade, we think that a licence-holder should further be treated on the same basis as employees who lose their old employment, The scale of compensation which w^e think he should receive in this respect will be found set out in the Schedule which deals with the question of compensation for loss of employment.81. We think that if a licence-holder desires to receive his compensation, both for personal goodwill and for loss of employment, in a lump sum, and not under the above-mentioned acheme, he should be at liberty to apply to the Purchasing Body, and it should be authorised and directed to negotiate with him for an immediate commutation for cash, and to pay him the agreed sum accordingly, if the amount to be paid does not exceed  500.VI.-WHOLESALE LICENCES.82. Wholesale dealers&apos; licences authorise the sale at any one time to one person of not less than two gallons or one dozen reputed quart bottles of spirits, wine or sweets, or not less than four and a half gallons or two dozen reputed quart bottles of beer or cider.83. The evidence given before us by representatives of the Wine and Spirit Association and others indicates that the character of such businesses is of extreme complexity, and presents problems somewhat different from those with which we have already dealt. It may be con-venient to class wholesale dealers as follows: (a) shippers and agents, that is persons selling imported liquor for re-sale to middlemen, who in turn supply them to the consumer; (b) vendors who supply liquor directly for consumption, in not less than the statutory minimum quantities.84. These classes however are not mutually exclusive nor are their trades confined to wine end spirits. A number of holders of Excise Wholesale Licences hold Excise Retail Licences too; thus they can supply a customers wants from a single bottle to as many dozens as his cellar will hold. Many in class (6) may have some trade in beer as well as wines and spirits. All sell British spirits as well as foreign. Some, and it may be many, who fall within class (a) have some private customers, to whom they sell for consumption, though always in no4i less than a dozen bottles. The members of class (a) are not actually very numerous, they we few in comparison with the members of class (b), but their businesses are very various and often very large. Some own large properties abroad vineyards, warehouses and so forth. Some re-ship wines and spirits from this country on a large scaie, The quantities, and still more the values, of stocks maturing in bond involve large figures. Some, again, hold agencies for foreign principals. Of the total capital involved it w7ould be very diificult, if not impossible, to form any just or approximate estimate, in the absence of accounts which are not available to us. It is certainly large; some idea of its magnitude may be obtained from figures given by the Customs and Excise Department.85. In 1914 11,637,316 gallons of wine were retained for home consumption in the United Kingdom, and the importation into England and Wales was 10,793,000 gallons. Among the principal countries of origin are Portugal, France, British Possessions and Italy. It is plain that very large economic interests in the Dominions and in Allied countries are concerned in this part of the Liquor Trade. The quantity of imported spirits, lodged in bonded warehouses in England and Wales was in 1914 7,284,000 gallons. It is safe to say that the purchase of the trade as a whole, albeit a trade in intoxicating liquors, would be a substantial addition to the cost of the scheme. Having regard to the minimum quantity of beer saleable under a wholesale beer licence, it is probable that the beer trade of many wholesale liquor merchants is an inconsiderable proportion of their total trade. It is further to be observed (1) that large parts of the assets, notably those abroad and the export portions of the trade, would on various grounds be unsuit-able for State acquisition; (2) that the selection, blending and preparation of wine presents problems different from and more delicate than those involved in brewing; (3) that the cost of compensation for severing the domestic portions of these businesses and assets from the foreign portions would be hard to reckon and heavy in amount, and that the domestic trade, if acquired, might not be successfully carried on when divorced from the rest; and (4) that this part of the Liquor Trade in its larger form stands to a considerable extent outside those exigencies of war which are understood to be especially urgent at the present time. The exercise of State control does not appear to disturb the wholesale trade so fundamentally as to necessitate its purchase. We therefore recommend that wholesale licences should not be acouircd except those which are held by breweries or other concerns which must be acquired as falling within another category and those which are at present held in conjunction with a retail licence where the business cannot be successfully carried on without that adjunct.VII. RETAIL OEF-LICENCES.1. Reasons for acquisition.86. Retail off-licences authorise the sale at any one time to any one person of not more than two gallons or one dozen reputed quart bottles of spirits, wines or sweets, or not more than 4^ gallons or two dozen reputed quart bottles of beer or cider. Spirits under the spirit retailers off-licence must not be sold in open vessels or in any quantity less than one reputed quart bottle, nor wine under the wine retailer&apos;s off-licence in open vessels or in any quantity less than one reputed pint bottle.
t   m&apos; 87. Retail off-licences may be conveniently divided into (a) those attached to premises where nothing but a retail off-trade in liquor is carried on, of which many will be tied to breweries : (b) those attached to premises where a trade in groceries or other goods is conjointly carried on, some of which will be tied to breweries; (c) those attached to premises where a business in intoxicants under a wholesale dealer&apos;s licence is conjointly carried on, of which few, if any, will be tied to breweries. Of the 20,000 retail off-licences in existence, 12,600 approximately are so-called grocer&apos;s licences, foiling within class (b). We have no means of estimating how many of the wholesale licences are conjoined with a retail off-licence,88. We have considered and rejected the possibility of excluding from purchase any of these three classes of retail off-licences. The principle is clear, that, if the State acquires the right of manufacturing beer and spirits .and of supplying them wholesale, and if it also acquires and undertakes the retail distribution of them, it must do so on some complete plan, devised to give effective control over and protection for the undertakings so acquired. There would be a serious breach in the safeguards of the scheme, if the Stated retail distribution, say of British spirits, was left exposed to the large and almost unlimited competition of retailers^ of foreign spirits down to the smallest quantity. Nor must it be forgotten that in acquiring on-licences the State will acquire and pay for the right conferred by the on-licence of retailing for off-consumption. Again, State control of the State trade would be merely illusory if the sale of all intoxicating liquors in open vessels for consumption off the premises were not taken entirely into State hands.89. These considerations point to the conclusion that some division must be made in the trade of distribution for off-consumption, the trade on one side of the line being acquired and that on the other not. Whether the existing control under the system of Permits and Bonded Stores, and the existing licensing and other statutes, may in the future need to be modified or supple-mented, is a matter on which we need offer no opinion. It seems to us that beyond a certain line purchase is not at present required, since all that is needed can probably be attained by an effective form of State regulation and control. The&apos; drawing of that line is rather a matter of practical convenience than of principle. We think the best line is to be found in the existing provisions as to Dealers&apos; or Wholesale Excise Licences, wdiich permit the sale to a single customer in a single transaction of a quantity as small in the case of wine, spmts and sweets as one dozen reputed quart bottles, and in the case of beer two. dozen. We therefore recommend, broadly speaking1, the exclusion from purchase of wholesale dealers&apos; licences and the acquisition of all retail off-licences. We recommend consequentially that the statute should enact that no further retail off-licences should be granted.*2. terms of acquisition.90. Premises used for the sale of intoxicating liquor under retail off-licences do not have to be specially adapted to the sale of-that commodity, though there may be exceptional cases. We do not therefore &quot;recommend that the freehold of off-licensed premises should be generally acquired by the State, but only that in exceptional cases the Tribunal should be authorised to allow the cost of re-adaptation to other purposes, and that the licence-holder should be com-pensated for the loss of his licence in any case.91. The terms of compensation for the acquisition of the business conducted under a retail off-licence should be the purchase at a valuation of the trader&apos;s stock of intoxicants, fixtures, utensils-in-trade, and other chattels owned for the purpose of carrying on a business under the licence, and in addition the payment in the case of an annual or shorter tenancy of not more than two years&apos; purchase the amount which we recommend for on-licensees and subject to the same charges in account of the profits attributable to their business. In con-sidering the case of leases with two years and upwards unexpired, we call attention to the fact that retail licences granted since .1902 are revocable at the State&apos;s discretion. We therefore recommend three years&apos; purchase only as a rigid maximum in those cases where the licence was granted to the present holder later than 1902. Licences however granted before 1902 which still remain in the same hands are practically guaranteed by the State during the holder&apos;s lifetime, and for this reason in certain cases of this description a higher number of years&apos; purchase than three might be equitable.92. As regards the so-called grocers&apos; licences, the principle of acquisition does not applv to trade in articles other than intoxicating liquors carried on along with the trade in them. The State cannot be recommended to acquire such businesses at large. In particular cases the vendor may be able to prove that the non-liquor business cannot be successfully maintained without the licensed business, in which case compensation should be paid for severance, unless the Purchasing Body elects to buy the business as a whole. AVe think further that compensa-tion for &quot;the severance of one part of the business from the rest cannot be measured by any formula fixed in advance.   It would be best determined in the light of subsequent experience.93. As regards retail licences held conjointly with a wholesale licence we recommend that such joint tenure should for the future be prohibited by legislation, and that existing retail off-licences so held should be acquired on the terms recommended for other retail off-licences. The vendor should have the option of selling the entire business, wholesale as well as retail, to the State, or of retaining the wdiolesale business without compensation for the severance from it of the retail business. We mav here add that a certain number of wholesale dealers hold retail on-licences conjointly with the wholesale licence. Such an on-licence should be acquired by the State upon the same principles as are recommended in the case of wholesale and retail
off-licences held conjointly. Where a retail licence is severed from the wholesale licence, the wholesale business being continued in private hands, the State need hardly acquire any part of the stock-in-trade.VIII. DISTILLERS AND RECTIFIERS.94. From the evidence which we have taken, it appears that there are in England and Wales only 8 distilling concerns and about 25 rectifying concerns. Though by law distilling and rectifying cannot be carried on in the same building, in some cases and on a considerable scale the same concern carries on both trades, and their separation would give ground for substantial compensation. In these trades the tied house feature is absent, though there are cases where, with or without a charge upon the licensed house, a loan is made to a licence holder, who covenants that during the currency of the loan he will buy his supply of spirits only from the lender.95. We think it inexpedient to make any recommendation upon the subject of purchasing the businesses of distillers and rectifiers in England and Wales, pending the completion of the reports of the Committees appointed to consider those questions for Scotland and Ireland. The distillation of spirits is more important in those countries than it is in England and Wales, and it is obvious that the matter should be treated on a uniform principle in all parts of the United Kingdom, though we must not be understood to recommend that the business of rectifiers must necessarily be dealt with in the same way as that of distillers.IX.-HOTELS AND RESTAURANTS.96. Although both &quot;Hotel&quot; and &quot;Restaurant&quot; are terms covering establishments of many different kinds, we do not think it necessary to attempt any precise definition of either. Part I. of the third schedule to the Licensing Consolidation Act, 19.10, furnishes a test for hotels, namely, that the premises should be structurally adapted to be used, and should be mainly used bond fide for the reception of guests and travellers desiring to sleep on the premises. For restaurants there is no similar provision. As has been said in the case of the wholesale wine trade, the measures of control which it is understood may be required by the exigency cf the present time may not cause such damage or disturbance to the business of hotels and restaurants as to involve their purchase, nor are economies to be looked for from their acquisition similar to those which might be made in the beer trade during the pressure of the war. Their management by the State presents some special difficulties, and on the other hand, without venturing to recommend specific measures of control, we think that the existing law, or further legislation, might provide the State with means of regulating their business in so far as the protection of its newly-acquired trade might require.97. We do not therefore make any recommendation as to terms of acquisition for hotels and restaurants, or parts of them, with two exceptions as below:  (1) Many hotels have in the same building, and as part of the same business, places intended for the sale of liquor, often called vaults, shades or bars. These are common both in the Metropolis and in large provincial towns. They can often be separated from the rest of the building with little, if any, structural alteration. Virtually, they are public-houses, and as such their business should be acquired. The principle of the terms of acquisition should be the capitalisation, by an appro-priate multiplier to be agreed between the parties or determined by the Tribunal on the merits of each case, of the profits on the business actually done in that part of the premises, after deducting apportioned management expenses and interest on capital. For the protection of the State&apos;s trade we think further that the business done at general bars or smokeroom bars forming part of an hotel and not acquired by the State, should be confined to selling liquor at prices not below the State&apos;s corresponding standard prices, and only to persons bond fide staying in the hotel for themselves and for their guests, not to members of the outside public. Persons bond fide resorting to an hotel or restaurant for the purpose of a meal should also be allowed to be served with liquor in connection therewith. Whether particular persons are bond fide guests or customers is a question of fact which would he determined by justices in such a manner as to prevent evasion of the law. If this restriction of the business done in hotel bars could be proved, after some substantial time of trial, to have resulted in actual loss, it should be made the subiect of a moderate compensation.(2) The other exceptionwould arise if a purchased brewervconcern happens to have among its assets a licensed house which falls within the definition of hotel as above. In such case the house, though an hotel, would be included in the State purchase along with other licensed houses.X.-RAILWAY REFRESHMENT ROOMS, DINING-CAR AND PASSENGER-VESSELLICENCES.98. Similarly we think that we need not recommend terms for the acquisition of railway refreshment rooms or of the business of supplying intoxicating liquor on dining-cars or steam-boats, provided that, as in the case of Hotels and Restaurants, the supply is limited to persons
who are bond fide travelling by the railway or steamboat as the ease may be. In these cases also, it would be necessary to fix minimum prices, below which the sale of the liquor would not be allowed, for otherwise, a considerable danger would arise of underselling in competition with the State&apos;s retail houses. In the case of railway refreshment rooms, the question of compensa-tion for loss of profit by the cessation of sale of intoxicants to non-travellers might be dealt with on the lines suggested with regard to Hotels and Restaurants, and we recommend accordingly.XL-THEATRE AND MUSIC HALL LICENCES.99. Where bars for the sale of intoxicating liquors exist in theatres, music halls and similar places of entertainment, we think that measures of control may be devised which make it unnecessary to &quot;recommend terms of purchase. The State might well find it necessary to fix minimum prices below which liquor could not be sold, but the theatre or music hall woubl be at liberty to sell liquor at any price it elected above the minimum fixed by the State, and it would seem that compensation is unnecessary.XII. CLUBS.100. We have taken evidence from officials of the Club and Institute Union, and the National Union of Liberal Clubs, and have received a Memorandum from the Association of Conservative Clubs. The number of clubs affiliated to these organisations is about 3,700, and the total number of registered clubs of all kinds (that is, clubs where intoxicating liquor may be supplied) probably exceeds 8,000.101. There may be some doubt whether a scheme of State purchase could be effectively worked, if the registered clubs, being so numerous, were to retain the financial interest in the distribution of liquor which at present they derive from the purchase of supplies at wholesale prices, and their distribution to members at retail prices. The eAadence has established that many clubs depend for their continued existence on the income derived from this source.102. The position of Clubs is anomalous. They are bodies of persons, purchasing liquor among other things for quasi-domestic consumption, whose arrangements may be adversely affected by the working of a scheme of State purchase and control. They do not carry on any business; they do not fall under the category of licence-holders. There is therefore no going concern for the State to acquire and no extinguishment of a licence for which the State can make compensation. Clubs cannot be left out of any scheme of State control of the liquor trade, but we have not to consider any question of management of the trade after acquisition, and the question whether the State would find it necessary to take any steps which would adversely affect the income of clubs is a question of management. Should such steps be necessary, the claim, if any, must be for compensation only.103. Some members of the Committee apprehend that after the conclusion of State pur-chase it may be found that it would be highly advisable that proprietors of hotels, restaurants, railway refreshment rooms, dining-cars, and theatre and music-hall bars, and also clubs, should obtain their supplies of beer and spirits through and from the State authority, and that they should have no appreciable financial interest in the sale and supply of them at minimum prices. This, however, appears to be a question of management not directly referred to the Committee.XIII.-OCCASIONAL LICENCES.104. In connection with occasional licences it is obvious that no question of purchase or compensation arises.XIV. MISCELLANEOUS   MANUFACTURERS   OF   BRITISH   LIQUORS.105. We do not for the present recommend the acquisition by the State of businesses producing British wines or cider. Regulations would probably provide adequate protection in respect of low alcoholic strengths, with penalties for non-observance.XV.-ALLIED   TRADES   AND   SUBSIDIARY   INTERESTS.106. There is a large number of trades connected more or less intimately with the liquor industry. It has been urged upon us, particularly in connection with the malting trade, that when an industry at present supplies various customers with implements, raw materials or commodities used in the various branches of-the liquor trade, the fact that under State purchase those customers would be reduced to one, namely, the State itself, gives rise to a right to receive compensation.   We cannot accept this view.107. The argument put forward by the maltsters is that many breweries own maltings, which on acquisition of the breweries would become the property of the State like the other assets; that the State would then enter into competition by means of its own maltings with the outside malting trade, and would probably favour and develop its own maltings to the disadv antage ofiseao
ISordinary maltsters. We cannot admit that if. the State carries on some enterprise it may not properly manufacture for itself materials which&apos; that enterprise requires, but must give out contracts for it to existing trades which supply such articles. The grievance could, in our opinion,, be met by a declaration by the Government that, for a period of years,, it would continue to supply its wants from its own maltings and from outside maltsters respectively in the same ratio in which the wants of the brewery trade were supplied at the time&apos; of purchase. Further than this we are not prepared to go.. .   XVI.-PERSONS   DISPOSSESSED   OF   EMPLOYMENT.. 108. Obviously, if the State were to acquire all the breweries and all the public-houses in England and Wales, a very large number of persons will lose their occupations by the closing of redundant breweries and houses, and the consequent concentration of operations. It is true that many, though not all, would enter or have the chance of entering the service of the State in similar capacities; but in many cases there would be a change of status, and many persons would be dispensed with altogether. We attach to this report a schedule shewing in detail the respective scales of compensation proposed which are based in principle on Civil Service Rules. Compensation, if assessed at or under  500, should be paid in cash.XVII.-APPLICATION OF A PURCHASE SCHEME TO WALES.109. Since the year 1881 the Sunday Closing (Wales) Act, which broadly speaking provides for the closing on Sunday of all premises in which intoxicating liquors are sold by retail, has been in operation throughout Wales. Inasmuch as our general proposals will apply equally to any variation in the extent of the trade or the amount of profits consequent on the operation of this statute in the Principality, we do not think that the Welsh case presents any features that call for special consideration or treatment.XVIII.-ESTIMATE  OF  COST.110. It is impossible for us to ascertain with any approach to completeness the outlay involved in State Purchase on the lines above discussed, as the materials are incomplete and the expert opinion is by no means uniform. According to the best judgment that we have been able to form, we think that the gross cost of acquiring breweries with all tied-houses on a fee simple basis, stocks in trade, and other assets; free houses on a like basis; the stock in trade, fixtures, utensils and furniture of on-licence holders and compensation for goodwill; and busi-nesses carried on under retailers&apos; Excise licences for consumption off the premises including goodwill, stock, furniture, fittings, &amp;c, may be estimated for England and Wales at not less than  350,000,000 on a pre-war basis of valuation. This does not include the cost of acquiring the production and wholesale distribution of spirits, or of compensation for loss of occupation to licence-holders and other persons engaged in the trade, or miscellaneous compensation, for example, for severance of business (see also para. Ill, Section 11), or for adaptation of premises to suit State management. On the other hand, the figure referred to is the estimated gross cost, and does not take into account the scaling down of the stock to be issued to a post-war basis of value or the proceeds derivable from sales of redundant properties.XIX.-SUMMARY   OF   RECOMMENDATIONS.111.   We summarise our principal recommendations as follows:  1. The following interests should be acquired :- (a) Any business carried on under a licence to brew beer for sale, including the fee simple in possession of all properties in which the owners of the business hold an interest for the purpose of carrying on their trade and all other assets held for that purpose (paras. 34 and 68-70), but with options (para. 69) as to the exclusion from purchase of assets not so held.(6) Any business carried on under an ordinary retail on-licence, together with the fee simple !in possession of all properties where such business is carried on, excluding any such business as is carried on in an hotel or restaurant as defined in the Third Schedule to the Licensing (Consolidation) Act, 1910 (paras. 76-81). Any business, however, carried on in shades or vaults of an hotel or restaurant (para. 97 (1)) should be acquired.(c) Any business carried on under a retail off-licence (paras. 86-93). We provide for the acquisition in special cases of non-liquor businesses of licensedgrocers,  and of  businesses conducted  under wholesale licences,   inseverable  frombusinesses under a retail licence in the same ownership (paras. 92 and 93).We leave over the question of acquiring businesses of distillers and rectifiers,pending the completion of the reports of the Committees appointed for Scotland andIreland (para. 95).2. The pre-war value of breweries and free on-licensed houses should be arrived at by (i) the fixing of a datum-period for the ascertainment of the average annual true commercial profit (paras. 35 and 36); (ii) the determination, on the facts disclosed
112. We desire to express our high sense of the ability and industry with which Mr. J. S. Eagles has discharged his duties as Secretary to the Committee.J. S. EAGLES, Secretary.October Slstx 1917.15680(Signed)SUMNER.JOHN BRADBURY. ARTHUR CHAPMAN. J. S. HARMOOD BANNER, THOS. HUGHES. J; F. MASON. WILLIAM PLENDER. ARTHUR  SHEEWELL. GEO. J. WABDLE. THOS. P. WHITTAKER.during that period and in accordance with rules to be laid down, of the true -profit of the concern on a freehold basis (para. 34) ;-and (iii) the application to that profit of an appropriate multiplier, tor which we propose 15 years&apos; purchase in normal cases for brewery undertakings. In the; case of free on-licensed houses, and of brewery undertakings which present exceptional features, the number of years&apos; purchase would in default of agreement be settled by the Tribunal on. the merits of each case (paras. 37-42, and 76). &apos;3, The actual purchase price should be settled when the time for completion of the transaction arrives by writing down the pre-war value ascertained as above by an amount appropriate to the depreciation of capital values generally which has taken place between the outbreak of war and the time of completion (paras. 43-50).4. The purchase price should be paid in Government stock, subject to arrangements for the payment of small amounts in cash (paras. 48-51, 81, and 108).5. The purchase price will in regard to each undertaking constitute a capital sum, the distribution of which, failing agreement among those concerned, should be effected in accordance with our recommendations under the direction of the Tribunal (paras. 53-59 and 76).6, The tenant of on-licensed premises (tied or free) should receive, in addition, to what-ever sum, if any, he may be entitled to out of the corpus in respect of his lease or tenancy being beneficial, the value of his stock and other chattels, and compensation in respect of personal goodwill, which in the case of an annual or shorter tenancy or a lease with less than two years unexpired should not exceed two years&apos; purchase of the profits attributable to such goodwill (paras. 76-81).7. Holders of retail off-licences should receive the value of their stock and other chattels and, where the residue of the tenancy does not exceed two years, not more than two years&apos; purchase of the profits attributable to the retail business in intoxicants; where the residue of the tenancy exceeds 2 years or the trading licensee is the freeholder, 3 years&apos; purchase of profits in respect of goodwill should be a maximum, except in the case of licences granted to the present holders before 1902 (paras. 90-93).8. Persons losing employment, including holders of on-licences, should be compensated inaccordance with the schedule (para, 108). 9. The following administrative machinery would be required:-(a) A Purchasing Body (paras. 31&apos; to 33).(b) A Tribunal to settle any issue between the Purchasing Body and the vendors (paras. 60 to 64).(c) Questions of fact arising on claims for loss of employment should he settled either by a division of the Tribunal or by a body constituted ad hoc (para. 65).10. The intermediate arrangements between the assumption of control and the completion of purchase should be as follows:  (a) A common date should be fixed for the assumption of control over all concerns to be acquired, as from which they should be conducted for the benefit of the State, the former owners receiving, until the purchase-consideration is paid, their average annual pre-war income derived from the concern (paras. 71-74).(b) The Stock should not be issued piece-meal as the purchase-price of indi-vidual concerns is ascertained, but in one operation on completion of the task of ascertainment (para. 52).(c) The statute should provide for purchase before control is assumed (para. 71). 11. After control is assumed, the exigencies of management by the State of the busi-nesses which it has acquired may make it necessary to apply to other businesses not acquired administrative measures of a character to raise compensation questions. Among the interests likely to be so affected, are maltsters (para. 107), theatre and music hall bars (para, 99), clubs (paras. 100-102), and hotels, restaurants, railway refreshment rooms, &amp;c. (paras. 96-98), in so far as their incomes may to any appreciable extent be adversely affected by restriction of sales to bond fi.de guests or travellers.
SCHEDULE.COMPENSATION FOR LOSS OF EMPLOYMENT.EMPLOYEES   PROPER:Class a. . .Pensions at the rate of .1 / 120tlP&apos; of average annual salary for three years up to date of taking over for each year of continuous employment in the licensed trade.Class B. j     ,Gratuities of one weelrs pay for each year of continuous employment m the licensed trade.class a to include:  (1) Salaried whole-time technical officers.(2) Other salaried whole-time permanent officers who prove that their existing conditions of: employment carry a reasonable expectation of pension on retirement.Class b to include:  (1) Salaried whole-time officers not included in Class A. (2) Whole-time employees on the wages list.No compensation in any case to be payable if an offer of equivalent State employment is made and refused. If such offer is made and accepted no compensation to be payable unless and until the employee retires on account of age or infirmity or his employment is terminated by the State for a reason other than personal misconduct, when the employee would receive the same compensation in respect of his pre-State employment as he would originally have received if State employment had not been offered him. in addition to any retiring allowance or gratuity in respect of his State service to which the terms of his State employment might entitle him.No compensation in any case to be payable in respect of less than ten years&apos; continuous employment in the licensed trade unless the applicant satisfies the Tribunal that he is possessed of specialised knowledge or aptitude which cannot be turned to account outside the licensed trade, or is likely by reason of his age or the state of his health to have difficulty in finding other employment.Any pensioner who accepts State employment at a rate of remuneration lower than that on which his pension was calculated to draw during such employment only so much of his pension as may be necessary to make up the difference between his current remuneration and that on which his pension was calculated. Any pensioner accepting State employment at a rate of remuneration not less than that on which his pension was calculated to draw no pension during such employment.The Tribunal to have power to make such addition to the rale of pension under Class A as may appear equitable in the case of any applicant who proves to their satisfaction that he had a reasonable expectation of a higher pension from his existing employer.LICENCE-HOLDERS,  ETC.Licence-holders trading on their own account, and the wives and families of such licence-holders employed for their whole time in the licence-holders business, should be compensated for loss of employment, subject to the above conditions, on the amounts debited for personal remuneration in their profit and loss accounts as settled for the purpose of compensation for loss of profit. The licence-holders themselves should receive pensions under Class A, and wives and families employed in the business gratuities under Class B. In the case1 of licence-holders, continuous occupation as licence-holders only should be reckoned for pension to the exclusion of any previous employment in the trade in other capacities.There will be a certain number of cases of licence-holders who became licence-holders late in life who would have difficulty in finding employment and for whom pensions on the Class A scale together with their compensation for loss of profits will lie insufficient to provide mainten-ance. The Tribunal might be authorised to make special benevolent grants in such cases cither in the form of lump sums or of special additions to pension.DIRECTORS.Three years&apos; purchase of total fees to Directors to be distributed by the Board as they may agree. Whole time Managing Directors, as many years&apos; purchase of remuneration on average of three years before retirement as they have been continuously employed as Managing Directors, with a maximum of 5 years&apos; purchase.Compensation from public funds for loss of employment to be strictly limited to (a) persons whose businesses are acquired and (b) persons standing to such persons in the relation of servants to masters. Such persons as consulting chemists, auditors, public-house valuers and other prn-fessional men whose practices mainly depend on the licensed trade will probably in many cases continue to be called in by the State or be offered salaried posts.* Note. In the event of a person who has been employed in the public service in an unpensionable capacitv being given a pensionable post it is not unusual to count half his unestablished service for pension. -It is, therefore, suggested that l/120th of salary for each year passed in the licensed trade (or half the normal Civil Service pension scale) would be a reasonable basis for calculation in ordinary case?.
APPENDIX.The following formula for apportioning the purchase consideration among the various classes of brewery secu-rity-holders is suggested as a guide to the Tribunal in normal cases:  The number of years&apos; purchase to be applied to profits naturally depends on the security that there is for such profits. The better the security, the larger the number of years&apos; purchase, and vice versa.If, following this principle, the profits of a Brewery Company are assumed to be  10,000, it is evident that the first&apos;  1,000 is covered ten times over; the second  1,000 is covered nine times over; the third eight times over, and so on. Therefore, the number of years&apos; pur-chase to be applied to the first  1,000 should be greater than that applied to the second  1,000, and the number of years&apos; purchase applied to the second  1,000 should be greater than the number of years&apos; purchase applied to the third  1,000.If an instance is assumed in which the fair multiplier would be 15 years&apos; purchase of the profits taken as a whole, these profits can be divided into a number of equal portions and a different number of years&apos; pur-chase applied to each, varying with the security that there is for the maintenance of the profits arriving, however, at an averaye number of years&apos; purchase of 15.For instance, if the whole profits of the Brewery Company are divided into 11 different portions, &apos;20 years&apos; purchase can be applied to the first eleventh; 19 years&apos; purchase to the second eleventh, and so on until the last eleventh, to which ten years&apos; purchase would be applied ; on average 15 years&apos; purchase would be ap-plied to the whole.The following example will illustrate the application of the principle:  Let it be assumed that the Capital of a Brewery Company is as follows:  5 per cent. Debentures......    80,0006  per cent. Preference Shareswith priority as to capital   ...    60,000Ordinary Shares.........    60,000--- 200,000and that the Profits before Charging De-benture Interest are   ...      ...      ...The Profits absorbed by Debenture Interestare therefore ... The Profits absorbed by Preference Dividendare      ...      ......while the Profits available for Dividends ontho Ordinarv Shares are 11,000 4,000  3,900  3,100  11,000The total purchase consideration would be  11,000 multiplied by 151; 11th of the Profits ...1.000 x20^20.000 1,000 xlfe 19,000 1,000 Xl8^ 18,000 1,000 Xl7^ 17,000=  165,000  1,000 4,000 74,000 Purchase eonsidera-tion for Debenture holders.1,000 Xl6: 1,000x153 1,000x14: 900x13:16,000 15,000 14,000 11,700 3,900 56,700 Purchase considera-tion for Preference Shareholders.100x13: 1,000x12: 1,000x11: 1,000x10:1,300 12,000 11,000 10,000 3,100 11,000Total profi is as above. 34,300 Purchase considera-tion for Ordinary Shareholders. 165,000Total purchase consideration as above.It is to be noted that the &quot; range &quot; selected need not be confined to that suggested above. Taking once more the example of an undertaking to which the 15 years&apos; purchase basis wduld apply, it would be feasible to divide the profits into 13 equal portions, the maximum and minimum multipliers in the formula becoming respectively 21 and 9. The average would remain as before at 15, but the resulting apportion-ment as between the various classes of securities would differ. The range would therefore require to be selected with some care on the merits of each indi-vidual case.Xotc- As explained in paragraph 59 of the Report, the proposed formula is not intended to be strictly adhered to in all cases, and adjustment of the results obtained by application of the formula would often be required to meet the consideration that, all other circumstances being equal, a debenture is a better security than a preference share. It is rather intended as a guide when the circumstances of a particular brewery company (e.;/., as regards capitalisation, class of properties, nature of trade, etc.) may be regarded as normal.Printed under the authority of His Majesty&apos;s Stationery Office By BARLING axd SON, Limited, Bacon Street, E.2.
