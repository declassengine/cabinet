[This Docnment is the Property of His Britannic Majesty s Government]Tehali gin3^-CON FIDENTIAL.DUPLICATION AND WASTE OF EFFORT.IF we are to realise the full war effort of this country in 1918 and in 1919, it is indispensable that the most searching economy of men and material should be prac-tised in every direction and by every Department; that no services should be duplicated ; that no more should be taken for any service, however necessary, than is required; and that one central and superior view should regulate every portion of our defensive and offensive system. Unless we are to be confronted with a failure in munitions and shipbuilding, and with a very serious diminution in our potential war-making capacity, it is necessary that there should be a general stocktaking.Those members of the War Cabinet or Government who were members of the Committee of Imperial Defence in the years before the war are, of course, familiar with every aspect of the &quot; Invasion &quot; argument. I will, there-fore, content nryself with drawing attention to a few simple facts.During the early months of the war, especially at the beginning, when Germany had the greatest incentive to try to throw a raiding arm)&apos;- across the North Sea, we had as our defence against invasion: 1. The Fleet, with a margin of eight Dreadnoughts. 2. Our submarines and flotillas.3. Two and then one, and finally no regular divisions. 4. The Territorial Army, newly mobilised, with hardlyany machine-guns, with 15-pounder artilleryand scarcely  any  reserves of ammunition,gunners almost unskilled. 5. No coast fortifications and only a few guns in openbatteries at the defended forts. 6. No mine-fields. 7. Practically no aircraft.In these circumstances the Germans did not choose or did not venture to make an oversea attack.We now have : 1. The British Fleet, with a margin of about twentyDreadnoughts. 2. The American Battle Fleet (the third strongest inthe world) if we require it. 3. Enormous   mine-fields,   covering    the   Germandebouches and hampering the movement evenof submarine craft. 4. Submarines and flotillas multiplied manifold. 5. The coast-line  fortified from, end to end withpowerful batteries mounted at every port andstill  being  increased,    Powerful  aeroplaneforces and a perfect system of coastal watch. 6. A defence scheme devised by Lord French himself,according to the latest experience of this war. [1146]
7. A Home Army mostly in its actual battle stations, aggregating a quarter of a million men and supported by a powerful field artillery of upwards of 500 modern guns and howitzers, with boundless supplies of ammunition and enormous numbers of organised, mobile or sited machine-guns.8. A million and a quarter other armed and uniformed men behind these.9. The Volunteers.Security is no doubt vital, but it must be remembered that if the factor of safety is exaggerated in any one part of our organisation, other parts may be exposed to fatal peril; and that if our strength is dissipated in making sure three or four times over in one direction, we may fail to have the strength available for the general offensive war, and may consequently be compelled impotently to witness the defeat of our Allies one by one.The very serious situation of the war and the impossi-bility on present lines of securing any effective numerical superiority or any sufficiently large mechanical superiority over the German armies in the field compel me to bring these aspects of our present arrangements to the notice of the War Cabinet.WINSTON S. CHURCHILL.November 6, 1917.printed at the foreign office by c. r. harrison.-9/11/1917.
