(9th ITovemberj 1^17.)general Feeling in DenmarkOwing to the dismemberment of Denmark in 1864, and especially since the abrogation by Germany Of the paragraph of the Prague Treaty dealing with the status of the Danish-speaking population of Schleswig, Germans have been unpopular.     At the beginning of the v/ar their position was less favourable than that of the subjects of any of the Entente Powers except Russia, which has always to a certain extent been feared in Scandinavian countries.As regards the political parties the Conservatives and the Democratic Left or Liberals are pro-Ally,whereas the Radicals and. Social-Democrats are pro-German and in favour of peace at any price.     These tendencies are reflected in the Press.     The leading newspaper in Denmark, the Berlingske Tidende, Conservative, while doing its best to preserve its neutrality has decidedly pro-Entente leanings.     The Conservative Press such as Vort Land and the Nationaltidende and the Liberal Kovedstaden are openly pro-Ally, the first indeed violently anti-German.    The principal Radical paper the Politiken is financed by a Jewish   syndicate and closely in touch v/ith the notorious German propagandist Dr. Georg Brandes and his brother Edvard Brandes, the present Minister of Finance.     It is distinctly pro-German.     The Socialist organ the Socialdemokraten makes little secret of its Germanophil views while professing rigid neutrality.It is always difficult to gauge the feeling of the average
man in the street ir neutral countries - He probably cares little about the merits or aims of the rival combatants and on the whole judges by how the conflict affects his food supply and pocket, in Denmark, while the German is traditionally considered an enemy there is perhaps little enthusiasm for the Entente or America, which get the benefit of the irritation caused by the ever-increas ing shortage of provisions and coal.   The German methods of making war have certainly not ad&amp;ed to their popularity.     In Denmark the curious phenomenon, noticeable in other countries, exists of the pacifists, who profess hatred of militarism and war, often openly siding with the Central Powers who are probably, with their abettors, the only nations who still uphold absolute monarchy and Government by force.     To what extent this attitude in Denmark is encouraged by funds supolied by the International Jew is not clear;   but the action of the Social Democrats is decidedly suspicious.Food Scarcity in Denmark.This question is rapidly driving all others into the back-ground.     During the debate on the Budget in the Folkething (The House of Commons) on Oct. 26, the Minister of the Interior stated that the result of the harvest had been less-than expected.     The difficulties experienced in the distribution and management of the grain supply would,therefore,be accentuated.     It would only be by strict attention to the recommendations as to the preparation of flour that it would be oossible to ensure a sufficiency of bread for all.    As regards fats,Denmark had hitherto consumed 55 miltdton kilograms of margarine, but now that imoortation had been stopped it was clear that there would be a scarcity of fats.     The suggestion that Denmark should prohibit the export of all butter and fat would,
if adopted, merely lead to a scarcity of other indispensable, commodities such as coal.     In these circumstances he warned the House that in the near future the Government would be compelled ito consider the necessity of rationing fats.     He added that the Danish people would have to endure considerable privations during the coming winter if a general famine were to be avoided.For some months past almost universal dissatisfaction has been, expressed at the scarcity of fat in Denmark.     In view of the f&amp;ot that that country is one of the principal butter and pork producing States of Europe it is hardly surprising that the public ia puzzled by the scarcity and demands an explanation.    The Government sometime ago appointed a Commission to investigate:-(l)   To what extent a higher percentage of Danish pork than allowed by agreement between the Government and the Butchers1 Corporation had been exported to Germany.(2)   How far the butchers had failed to keep the home market supplied with pork.The Commission acquitted the expert Committee of all responsibility for the &quot;irregularities&quot; wh4.cn had occurred (that is the export of extra pork to the yalue of  600,000) on the ground that it v/as the result of a defective -system.As regares the second point the Commission came to the not very satisfactory conclusion that &quot;the supply of pork, for home consumption, had occasionally been inadequate&quot;.     As to the rumours of illicit export the Commission declared that there ms no evidence to prove it.The findings of the Commission do not appear to have found much favour with the public.     Judging by an apparently inspired article in the socialdemokraten (a Government organ) the official explanation of the shortage of fat is lack of maize * th   failure of th:- harvest and the closing down of the margarine factories.
The impossibility of obtaining corn or fodder from America has also greatly influenced the present scarcity.In order to relieve the butter shortage the Minister of the Interior recently (Oct.18) introduced a temporary measure authorising the Treasury to pay a subsidy for each kilog. of butter used in Denmark up to 750,000 Kg. a week.     This is expected to reduce the price considerably.Agriculture.In connection v/ith the food scarcity it is important to consider the effect which the stoppage of imports is likely to exercise on the agricultural situation in Denmark.     At a meeting of Zeeland farmers on Oct.25 the Head of the Agricultural School drew attention to the gloomy prospects of the coming v/inter.     He stated that the stoppage of the importation of oil cake would mean an economic catastrophe of the gravest order.     He pointed out that the land in Denmark was not susceptible of being trans-formed so as to produce corn as the main crop, the land being too light.     Stock-raising mu3t remain the chief source of Danish agricultural industry.     The problem would be how to feed an adequate number of cattle during the coming winter.Failure of the Iceland Fisheries.The herring fishery has been a failure partly owing to bad Y/eather, partly because the fish have not been present in large shoals. The higher price of coal and salt (coal now costs  14 to  16. 14. 0. a ton) has also lowered such profits as were made.-The cod-fishing, the next important in the Island, has also been a disappointment.     Again the price of coal has contributed its share to this result ae also the restriction of marketo and the scarcity of the fink.     Earlier in th;. season there was a shortage of petrol and when the supply arrived much of the best season had passed.
The principal markets are Italy, Spain, England and the mother country.     For a long time the laBt named has received no fish from Iceland while the enormous freights have lessened the export abroad.     It is hardly necessary to Say that much distress has been caused among the fisher population by these conditions.9/11/17.
