WAP^ CABINETaTrTTT25&apos;64. &quot;      &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;*&quot; Sn^ASldN IN &quot;RUSSIA.Memor anduKV ^yJDej^ar&quot;A Resi-dent Englishman1s View of the Situation,&quot;(See Eastern Report No, XL, November 1st, 1917, page 20)The views expressed by &quot;A Resident Englishman&quot; make the following accusations(1)   A separate peace on the part of Russia is merely a matter of time.(2)   The whole of the directing element of the Sovyet consists of Jews and fcr the most part German Jews,(3)   KerenskiJs private secretary is a Jew undoubtedly in the pay of the Bolshevik organisation.(4)   Kerenski himself was formerly in the pay of the International, and he continues to be in sympathy with the Kienthal group, etc.(5)   Terestchenko and other moderate elements are put in the Government to deceive the Allies,He then advises the Allies to organise a counter-revolution.     His accusations may be answered as follows(1) Every party in Russia has openly repudiated the Idea of a separate peace, and every reliable witness that comes from Russia states that the idea of a separate peace is utterly repugnant to the Russian Nation,
(2)   The Jews on the Central Executive Committee of the Sovyet are partly Moderates and partly Extremists.     It is absolutely unfair to classify all the Jews as Extremists. It is also untrue to describe Russian Jews, most of whom have German names, as German Jews.(3)   Kerenski&apos;s private secretary is a Jew named Soskis who is well-known in England, where he lived until a few months ago.     If he were or ever had been in the pay of the Bolshevik organisation it is inconceivable that such sleuth-hounds as Burtsev and Alexinski would not have revealed it to the Russian public long ago.(4)    Formerly Kerenski belonged tc the &quot;Socialist Inter-national&quot;;    so did Vanderve-lde, Ilyndman, Thomas and Seheidemann. But certainly Kerenski now stands not fcr International Socialism but for Russia.     There is absolutely no foundation for saying that he is in sympathy with the Kienthal group, and he has severed all connection with Chernov, who was the only pacifist member in any Government that Kerenski belonged to.       If Kerenski really intended to throw in his lot with the Bolsheviks it is quite certain that he would have been publicly denounced in ^ussia long since and that the Cadets would never have joined any Government of which he was Prime Minister,(5&quot;)    It is impossible to believe that Tereshchenko and other moderate elements in the &quot;present Government could be so naive as to let their names be used merely to deceive the Allieso      It may be taken for granted that they know just as much about Kereneki p^nd his intentions as the &quot;Resident Englishman&quot;.The &quot;Resident Englishman^&quot; advice to the Allies to organise a counter-revolution is as absurd and impracticable as it would be dangerous if: it were listened to.DEPARTMENT OF INFORMATION 9th November. 1917.
