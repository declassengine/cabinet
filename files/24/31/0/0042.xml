G.T. 2542.THE LABOUR SITUATION.--       7 NOV 1917Report from the Ministry of Labour for the Week ending theJHsrt^?rfotrepp*9i7.Summary.Part I: General Remarks.The position in South Wales is discussed.The development of the agitation in connection with the 12\ per cent, increase is described.Part II: Press Opinions.Criticism is principally directed to the Ministry of Food, on various grounds. The agitation in connection with the postponement of the Education Bill and the Housing question continues.Part III: District Reports.In London there is unrest among aircraft workers. Food scarcity is attracting much attention in London and the West Midlands. The West Midlands, Yorkshire, and North-eastern districts are much exercised about the regulations in connection with the withdrawal of the leaving certificate system.In the Northern district the Durham miners are restless, and in Scotland the shaleworkers.Part IV: Strikes.A short but serious strike of colliery examiners and firemen has occurred in South Wales, and in the same district a stoppage has taken place arising out of a demarcation dispute between A.S.E. and Boilermakers. The number of strikes reported by the Statistics Department remains at 55.Part V: Disputes.The number of disputes by the various Departments dealing with Labour shows a slight decrease, and the position is more satisfactory.The Committee on Production has just issued a National Award of 5s. to the Shipbuilding and Engineering trades.I. General Remarks.The Position in South Wales.Latest information on the subject of the Miners&apos; ballot on the &quot;comb-out &quot; justifies the favourable opinion reported last week, and it is now clear that the Resolution of the Delegates&apos; Conference of the 8th October will be rejected by an overwhelming majority, probably not less than four to one. This result, coupled with the enthusiasm which greeted General Smuts at Tonypandy, has proved a very serious reverse to the hopes of the pacifist party. The &quot; South Wales Pioneer,&quot; the local I.L.P. and pacifist organ, affects to treat General Smuts&apos; meeting as a negligible incident, and suggests that the opposition was excluded. It heads its article &quot; Smuts at Tonypandy.   Farcical Proceedings,&quot; and states that &quot; only a[1100-3] &quot; B
negligible number of miners were present,&quot; the best seats having been reserved for &quot; the select (?),&quot; who arrived at the meeting at the last minute, and that there is no need to dwell upon the contents of the speeches, which were of the usual militarist type. The article continues with a bitter attack on General Smuts for his action in 1913, on the occasion of the Rand strikes. The fact that the I.L.P. think it necessary to adopt these methods is the best proof of the effectiveness of General Smuts&apos; visit.From the Pacifist standpoint the combination of the success of the War Aims meetings and of the miners&apos; vote on the comb-out is a very serious defeat, and the loyal portion of the South Wales population is doubtless proportionately en-couraged. At the same time it would be a mistake to suppose that all danger is at an end in South Wales. The fact that 15,000 men practically voted against the war with the eyes of the whole country on them is not without significance, and the number would doubtless have been larger But for the activity of the War Aims Committee. It is essential that these activities should continue in order to counter-act the vigorous and well-organised pacifist propaganda, which unless regularly countered may yet produce deplorable results.The V2\ per cent. Increase.The application of the V2\ per cent, increase has been the subject of widespread agitation and unrest during the past week. From all parts of the country reports have been received on this subject, which combine to disclose a position of consider-able gravity.Generally the agitation has three aspects. First, in every quarter, there is complaint on the part of highly-skilled men that the advance in no way meets their needs. Second, a doubt, also general, exists as to the classes to whom the increase applies. This difficulty is rendered more serious by the inclusion of the Iron-moulders in the classes who benefit, though this trade is largely undiluted. Third, there is a very determined effort in progress among the less skilled men, and also among the labourers to obtain for themselves a similar increase. The last aspect of the question, though probably not more difficult of solution, is distinctly of greater importance, owing to the very large number of workers to whom it applies. At a meeting at Leeds on Sunday last 30,000 unskilled men passed a resolution demanding the increase, while from Lancashire and Cumberland it is reported that leading trade unionists expect no peace until the increase is made universal.The general discontent has been rendered even more acute by a widespread rumour that the masters are placing the men on piece work in order to evade pay-ment of the enhanced wage. In other places, where the skilled men were already in receipt of extra rates, these have been withdrawn, the 12^ per&quot; cent, increase being substituted, to the great dissatisfaction of the men. This has been evinced in certain shops by resort to the stay-in-strike.The problem is believed to be still further complicated by the fact that the employers in the shipbuilding and engineering trades are approaching their em-ployees with the object of settlement of the wages question by agreement and without reference to the Committee on Production. Any action of this kind would, of course, complicate very seriously wages questions in Admiralty shipyards and in munitions factories.To sum up, the 12-1 Per cent- increase for skilled men appears to be creating more difficulties than it has solved, and the strong demand now being made for it by the semi-skilled and unskilled workers will, if successful, produce the result that all classes of labour will have had an increase of 12-^ per cent., irrespective of output, and the original question of the relative earnings of skilled and unskilled men will remain where it was at the start.II. Press Opinions.Conscription of Wealth.The agitation in favour of serious taxation of capital continues, and members of the Labour Party are said to be elated at the prospect of the deputation which Mr. Bonar Law has agreed to receive upon this subject on the 14th November.
Government Control: Food.There is a very general criticism of faulty distribution of supplies of food, of scarcity of certain essential commodities, and of the price of milk.The &quot; Leeds Citizen,&quot; referring to general scarcity at Leeds, to a milk shortage at Manchester, and to scarcity of sugar and tea at Newcastle and of butter, bacon, and margarine all over the country, calls for State control and distribution. It considers rationing the only safeguard for the future.The &quot;Woolwich Pioneer&quot; gives prominence to a report of the deputation to Lord Rhondda on the question of food supplies at Woolwich, and is evidently gratified at its result.&quot;Clarion&quot; alleges that adequate steps to prevent profiteering in milk still remain to be taken.   Referring to local supplies it says: &quot; The milk producers are raking in the shekels, as they have no carriage to pay and wages and other costs have not been increased sufficiently to warrant the increase in price.&quot;Many of the papers refer to the potato difficulty, and criticise the order which prevents&apos;the grower selling at less than Ql. a ton, if he wishes to do so.The &quot; New Statesman,&quot; in the course of an article on economy, writes: &quot; It is a fact that in certain boroughs, while all the grocers on the Committee obtained sugar to the full extent of their applications, no grocer not on the Committee get sugar to the full extent of his application.   No doubt a coincidence, but an interesting coincidence.&quot;The &quot; Herald &quot; denounces the work of the Food Controller: &quot; As a Food Controller he is as helpless and hopeless as any of these who preceded him. There is only one way out. Adl the machinery and officials for securing fair or unfair profits and dividends must be swept away. Lord Ehondda must be set free to earn his own bread some other way, and other men and women appointed to take over all food and other necessaries of life for the service of the nation, distributing the same on equal terms to the whole popula-tion. Y\7e must share and share alike all there is to share, and thus secure that all classes in the country are fairly dealt with.&quot;Government Control: Cotton.The &quot; Cotton Factory Times&quot; prints a leading article highly appreciative of the work of the Cotton Control Board.Government Control: Coal.The rise in the price of- coal consequent on the increase in wages granted to miners is attacked by a number of the Labour journals. The &quot; Call&quot; says that the Government takes very good care that its friends the profiteers come by &quot; no loss through having to grant increases of wages to their employees,&quot; and protests against the vicious circle of increases, first of wages then on a larger scale of prices. The &quot; Bradford Pioneer &quot; points.out tha,t the increase of 2s. Qd. is much more than is necessary to meet the increased cost of production due to the rise in wages.The Constitution of the Labour Party.The discussion of this constitution and the opposition of the I.L.P. and Socialist press continue. &quot;Forward&quot; says: &quot; If the new organisation perishes, it will perish because of the block vote.&quot;The &quot; South Wales Pioneer &quot; considers that for the purposes of political action trades unions and Socialist organisations cannot be compared on the basis of membership.Labour and the War.The &quot;Call &apos;&apos; publishes an article under the heading, &quot;A Military Menace to Trade Unionism.&quot; The article quotes a letter received from a soldier at a Home depot who alleges that notices have been posted up - in camps threatening with punishment any soldiers who attend political or trade, union meetings, and stating that meetings of soldiers are being held in. various canteens and OI.C.A. huts on &quot;The subject of the Abolition of Trade Unions.&quot;   The paper comments:-&quot;. ^ere ^n cold blood is nakedly exposed one of the many evils inherent in militarism-that it is anti-democratic. It is, and always has been, a bitter and unscrupulous foe to democracy.&quot;
Reconstruction.The National Guilds League is conducting an intensive press campaign in the Labour papers. During the past week articles favouring the Guild policy have appeared in the &quot; South Wales Pioneer,&quot; the &quot;Yorkshire Factory Times,&quot; the &quot; Leicester Pioneer,&quot; the &quot;Bradford Pioneer,&quot; and amongst the great dailies, the &quot;Glasgow Herald.&quot; The adoption of the Whitley Report recommendations by the War Cabinet has been received in a hostile spirit by the &quot; New Age,&quot; the &quot; South Wales Pioneer,&quot; and the &quot;Call,&quot; with indifference by the &quot;Herald&quot; and the &quot;Labour Leader,&quot;.and with unexpected acceptance by the &quot; Clarion.&quot;The Education Bill.The agitation on the subject of postponement of the Education Bill continues actively.  On this subject the &quot; Labour Leader &quot; writes: &quot;It is scandalous that the education of the workers&apos; children should be jeopardised because of the prolongation of a war for the aims of capitalists, and we must insist on tin-development of life being given precedence to its destruction.&quot;The &quot;Herald &quot; writes in a similar strain: &quot; It is a monstrous thing that the nation should be fooled on so important- a subject......The nation, the hewers of wood and drawers of water, all those who wish a higherand better life for the peoples, must join together and turn out of office our present rulers, and instal in their place men and women who will put the well-being of the people above vested interests of every kind.&quot;Housing.The publication of the report of the Royal Commission on Housing in Scotland has given an impetus to the agitation on this subject. The state, of affairs on the Island of Lewis affords material for an attack of the usual kind in the &quot;Herald.&quot;   It says:-&quot; The crofts are too small and congested to maintain a family, yet on the island there is a &apos; deer park forest,&apos; part of which contains enough land to provide 270 crofts. . . . How-ever, &apos; the estate discourages the settlement of the surplus population on the land,&apos; and while private ownership continues congestion and insanitary housing are inevitable.&quot;House shortage is reported in various papers from Bootle, Holywell, Glasgow, Kirkintilloch, Arbroath, Newport (Mom), Birmingham, Wigan, Gourock, Newcastle, Durham, Sunderland, and Huddersfield.III. District Reports.London.The chief centre of unrest in the London area during the past week has been Hendon and the various surrounding districts, which are engaged on the manu-facture of aeroplanes. A number of strikes have occurred, several of which are still in progress (see Section IV), and the outlook is not promising.Apart from this the scarcity of certain articles of food has been a fertile cause of discontent. The position at Woolwich continues to be serious, and there is much talk of downing tools over this question. A deputation of shop stewards was granted an interview with Lord Rhondda during the week, and the position put before him. They complained particularly that the dearth at Woolwich was not being experienced in better-class districts. Lord Rhondda promised to enquire into their grievances and to ensure that further supplies should be forthcoming. It would appear from the &quot; Woolwich Pioneer &quot; that this interview has had a very favourable effect.South-West.The situation in the south-west is normal, except for trouble at Bristol over a question of demarcation in certain shipbuilding work and at Southampton where there is much sympathy with the men on strike at East Leigh (see Section IV). A mass meeting of some 3,000 men was held on Thursday last, and while it was decided not to take any extreme action for the moment the financial and moral support of the Shipbuilding and Allied Trades was extended to the strikers.
West Midlands.The food question is also the burning topic in this district. At Birmingham resolutions have been passed against the muddling policy adopted by the Food Controller, while at Coventry there has been reported a proposal to down tools on the 17th November and on subsequent days at intervals should no improvement take place, as a form of protest. This suggestion is reported to have been favourably received by all the local unions.The alleged machinations of the employers in connection with the withdrawal of leaving certificates have continued to be a burning topic in the Birmingham area. It is hoped, however, that the notice issued by the Ministry of Munitions warning employers against any such action will have a good effect.Yorkshire and East Midlands.This area continues to be quiet, though there is grumbling over the shortage of certain articles of food, and the 12i per cent, increase to skilled workers (referred to in Section I) is being much canvassed particularly in Leeds and Sheffield.North-West.The regulations in connection with the withdrawal of leaving certificates are causing intense excitement in West Lancashire. Two mass meetings were held m Manchester, the one on Saturday and the other on Sunday, and a crowded meeting was held at Oldham also on Sunday. A circular letter alleged to have been sent out by the Engineering Employers Federation has been discovered. In this employers are advised not to engage skilled men who have left their work since the 15th October without the consent of their previous employer. The men held that this policy is directly encouraged by the Minister- of Munitions&apos; Circular L. 106, in which the necessity of avoiding dislocation is pointed out to the employers. This circular was denounced both at Oldham and Manchester, and demands for its withdrawal have been sent to the Ministry of Munitions.At Barrow also, much discussion is taking place owing to the rumours that the local employers are adopting a similar scheme. The Barrow shop stewards are displaying great activity. Food scarcity and the employment of non-union men are the two questions occupying their attention. On the one point they have made arrangements to have their views placed before the local food committee; on the other they have ascertained that Messrs. Vickers are employing about forty, non-union men, and the question of threatening a down tools policy if they are not dismissed will shortly come up for decision.There is considerable restlessness on the Mersey, where demarcation and other difficulties have caused strikes.A probability of trouble at Messrs. Brunner Mond&apos;s works at Northwich, where some 8,000 workers are employed, is also reported.Northern.The situation as regards leaving certificates continues to be good and the ship-building industry is generally quieter. LIn the Durham minefield the question of demanding an increase in the minimum wage is being discussed, and it has been proposed to hold a ballot. A demand is also being made in the Northumberland and Durham coalfield for an increase of 50 per cent, in the basic rate of wages.Wales.The position in South Wales is dealt with in Section I. Scotland.The stock grievances in the Clyde area are the 100 per cent, wages increase, the 50 per cent, reduction in the prices of commodities, and the question of income tax.Great activity has been shown by the I.W.G.B. and C.Y/.C. in connection with these questions, and it is thought not improbable that trouble, more or less serious may arise on one or other of them in the immediate future.[1100-3] c
There is considerable restlessness among the Scottish shale workers, whose application to be granted the Coal Controller^ recent award has been refused. It is feared that a serious strike may occur.in connection with this question.Ireland.Unrest has recently been noticeable in the shipbuilding yards in Belfast, particularly at Messrs. Harland and Wolff&apos;s. This is said to be due to the activities of a Vigilance Committee which has been formed, and which is in close touch with the extremist leaders on the Clyde and elsewhere.IV. Strikes.The most serious strike which took place during the past week was that of the South Wales and Monmouthshire Colliery Examiners and Firemen. As was stated in last week&apos;s report a conference was held on the 31st October at which certain proposals put forward by the Coal Controller in regard to the recognition by the owners of the Examiners&apos; Association and agreed to by the Employers&apos; Association were submitted to the representatives of the men, who refused to accept them.On the following day the members of the Union left work, and the majority of those examiners and firemen who are non-unionists followed their example. As a result 80 per cent, of the collieries and between 100,000 and 150,000 miners were thrown idle.On Saturday the men, in consideration of the national crisis, agreed to return to work pending further negotiations on the points at issue. - The present position is accordingly somewhat unsatisfactory.Strikes have occurred during the week at collieries at Sutton, Mansfield, and New Hicknell, all in Nottinghamshire. In the first two cases the dispute has arisen out of th? employment of non-unionist labour; in the last over a question of lamps. Several other strikes of colliers are still in progress, notably the one at Llandebie, in South Wales, which ha;; attracted some public attention owing to the vigorous form of picketing which is alleged to have been adopted by the men.A strike involving about 1,000 fitters and mechanics employed at the London and South Western Railway&apos;s works at Eastleigh has been in progress for the past few weeks. The men demand thai they shall be paid at the same rates as those employed in the shipyards at Southampton. The Company refuses to give way, as the men have various compensatory privileges. The affair is becoming serious, for considerable sympathy has been worked up at Southampton, and at shops along the line, where minor stoppages have already occurred.One of the most serious demarcation disputes that have recently occurred is in progress between the A.S.E. and the Boilermakers&apos; Society in the South Wales ports. A number of points are at issue and the dispute has unfortunately resulted in a serious stoppage of work, estimated to affect as many as 5,000 engineers. The Unions have agreed to enter into negotiations, and on this understanding the majority of the men have resumed work. Those at Port Talbot and Swansea, how-ever, remain obstinate. This trouble is peculiarly unfortunate, as the work on which the men are engaged, chiefly gun fittings, is of a very urgent and essential nature.A short strike of fitters at the B.S.A. factory, Birmingham, took place on Monday last. The points at issue are two : firstly, the question of the recognition of shop stewards, and secondly, the fact that unskilled men are earning double the pay of skilled men. These have been referred to the Ministry of Munitions, and the men have returned to work.The dispute in the Belfast Linen Trade was settled on the 1st November. The case was referred to the Minister of Munitions for him to make use of his powers under the Munitions Act. It was decided to hold a conference between representa-tives of the workers and employers. At this conference it was mutually agreed that the tenters should receive an increase of 35. Qd. and certain commissions which gave them a minimum increase of 85. 3d. per week, and that these terms should supersede Mr. Vesey Knox&apos;s award of 9s. issued on the 4th October.Strikes have been and in some cases are still in progress at six Aircraft factories in the neighbourhood of London.   The London District Aircraft Woodworkers&apos;
Council has issued a proclamation in which various points of complaint are raised. By far the most important of these appears to be the alleged, introduction of a system of payment by results by the employers with the connivance and assistance of the Ministry of Munitions, and this in spite of the fact that the workers had previously . balloted on the question and decided against the system by an overwhelming majority. The Ministry have secured a resumption of work, but it is not likely that further trouble will be avoided.V. Disputes.The Shipyard Labour Department reports 167 cases involving points of con-troversy; this a decrease of 13 as compared with last week. The number of settle-ments effected is given as 44, and the number of stoppages of work which have occurred as 3.On the Clyde difficulties with the rivetters over the question of rates on standard vessels and with the plumbers over a recent award of Sir Richard Lodge have not yet been settled. No stoppage has, however, occurred, and the Shipyard Labour Department hopes that it may be avoided. The situation on the Clyde is somewhat quieter, as the men are waiting for the national award by the Committee on Production.Troubles over questions of demarcation continue to occur, notably on the Mersey and in South Wales. Much valuable time on work of vital importance has thereby been lost, and this is the more to be deplored as there would appear to be no valid reason why such difficulties should not be quickly and reasonably dealt with.The coalmining industry continues to be quieter, though a number of strikes are referred to in Section IV.The War Office Contracts Department again reports nine cases of dispute, four of which have not previously appeared.The various claims put forward by the unions in the Scottish jute and flax industry have been referred by the Chief Industrial Commissioner to the Committee on Production in so far as they affect war work. The Scottish Council of Textile Workers remains obstinate in demanding that even that part of their application which refers to work other than on munitions shall be dealt with under the same reference as munition work. A conference which was held in London failed to produce a more reasonable frame of mind, and a representative of the Ministry of Labour is now dealing with the difficulty on the spot.The woollen industry continues quiet, but there is considerable restlessness in the leather trade, more particularly in the Liverpool area., where strikes are in progress.There is also trouble in the clothing trades owing to the refusal of the Northern Clothing Manufacturers&apos; Association to pay wages in accordance with an award, by the Committee on Production. The manufacturers have protested, affirming that if they pay under the terms of the. award they will be paying a much higher rate than that ruling in the district.The number of cases of strike and dispute reported by the Ministry of Munitions shows a slight decrease, the figures being 31 as opposed to 33 last week. 13 strikes and 7 disputes have been settled.Among these disputes may be mentioned one at Messrs. Russel and Sons, Ltd. (Wednesbury), in which the points at issue had been referred to the Committee on Production, whose award was favourable to thej firm. The men refused to accept it and handed in their notices, whereupon the firm, fearing that a strike among these particular men would bring their whole factory to a standstill, gave way to their demands.Much trouble is experienced over alleged cases of victimisation. It is but rarely that these charges can be substantiated, yet it appears that in almost every case of dismissal the workers are prepared to allege victimisation.An important question has been raised at Glasgow in connection with con-ditions of apprenticeship. The point is whether apprentices bound only by oral agreement are free to leave their employer after giving a week&apos;s notice under the Munitions Act, and also whether employers are obliged to grant certificates of service to apprentices who leave under such circumstances. A case has recently arisen involving these points, and the firm deny the iad&apos;s right to leave,or to have his certificate. As it is estimated that about 90 per cent, of the apprentices in the Clyde area are not bound by written agreements the matter is one of some importance.
oThe Committee on Production during the past week heard 33 cases, 19 in London and the others in Scotland. Two general claims for an advance of wages were heard in London, the one affecting roll turners in the iron and steel trade, and the other ironfounders in the Ulster district. In Scotland general claims affecting iron foundries and steel works were also heard.
