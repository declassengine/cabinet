357:-3 Doaumeat is to gmger^ of His Britaimie M4esiy&apos;s iOTOTa^js^JSECRET G.T.-2579-&quot; Of)MUNITIONS BUDGET, 1918. (Provisional.)1. THE foundation of the Munitions Budget is Tonnage; the ground floor is Steel; and the limiting factor in the construction is Labour.The period covered by this Budget is, broadly speaking, from now to the end of the 1918 offensive, and the figures relate precisely to the twelve months from the 15th November, 1917, to the loth November, 1918.2. The following are the principal demands made by the fighting departments upon the Ministry of Munitions for the campaign of 1918 compared to 1917 :-(1.) The demand of the War Office for the completion of their programme involving a 40 per cent, further increase in the striking power of the artillery, both in guns and ammunition.(2.) The demand of the Admiralty for doubled shipbuilding materials.(3.) The demand of the Air Board for tripled aeronautical supplies.3. Tonnage. The programmes as proposed require the delivery here of 1,100,000 tons per month for munitions alone (i.e., apart from items for other depart-ments included in our tonnage allocation). To secure this there should be assigned to us for all purposes ],H00,000 tons of shipping a month. I propose to place orders abroad somewhat in advance of this figure. If the shipping falls off, the material ordered will he received more slowly. It is better to have a moderate surplus of orders awaiting shipment than not to have the tonnage fully occupied with vitally needed materials.4. Iron Ore. More than half our total munitions imports consists of iron ore. The blast furnaces could deal with a monthly importation of 735,000 tons of Spanish and Swedish (mainly hematite) ore, and with a monthly home production of 1,500,000 tons of (mainly basic) ore. On the above tonnage basis I count only on getting 635,000 tons of ore, viz. : 550,000 tons from Spain, and 85,0U0 tons from Sweden. There is a good reserve of Swedish ore, which can be drawn upon in case of need. I estimate that the home production will average over 1,500,000 tons a month.5. Steel. On this basis we can produce in the year approximately 8,500,000 tons of finished steel product. Orders are being placed for 1,000,000 tons of steel from the United States (included in our tonnage require-ments.) Arrangements have also been made with the [1007-4] B
French and with the Shipping Controller to carry approximately 500,000 tons of French Shell Steel already purchased in America which we should other-wise have had to supply from home sources. Having regard to this rearrangement of supplies it may be said that our steel production in relation to our needs and our commitments to the Allies is equivalent to 10,000,000 tons. &apos; Out of this every requirement must be met, and if through shipping shrinkage the total production is reduced, all programmes will be affected.6. Allocation of Steel. Shipbuilding is the first charge on our steel resources. Orders have been given that the rolling mills are to be kept constantly fed to their full and increasing capacity, and that sections and other shipbuilding components shall be supplied in their proper proportion to the output of plates assigned to the Admiralty, until such time as the ship-yards are provided with material to their full capacity. An agreement has been reached wuth the Admiralty after a full disclosure of figures whereby a portion of our rolling-mill production, varying from 7,000 to 8,500 tons a week shall be reserved for all non-Admiralty services (including the War Office and the civilian needs of the country) and the whole of the rest of the production assigned to Admiralty needs. We have already succeeded in raising the Admiralty supply of plates from 10,000 tons a week in July to an average of 20,000 tons a week at the end of September, and subject to their capacity we shall still further raise them gradually up to at least 27,000 tons a week in October .1918. This with other shipbuilding material to be supplied during the period under forecast is equivalent to a construction of from 2,000,000 to 2,500,000 tons of merchant shipping in addition to warship construction. The twelve months&apos; Admiralty allocation of steeL aggregates approximately 2,000,000 tons.The next principal draft on our Steel Budget is shells. On the programme demanded by the War Office this requires approximately 2,500,000 tons for Great Britain.The requirements of the Allies for steel of all classes have been cut down to about 700,000 tons in the year, chiefly by the arrangement to ship 5u0,000 tons of shell steel from the U.3.A. to France. The other direct munition requirements, including aircraft, guns, military railways, tanks, steel-works extensions, &amp;c, are approximately 2,200,000 tons. The War Office, the India Office, and certain other Departments require approximately 600,000 tons, leaving 1,500,000 tons for construction, machinery, and the so-called civilian services of the country, most of which are intimately related to munitions production.These civilian requirements are mostly for the purpose of the maintenance and repair of plant and works in this country. Among these the upkeep of our railways and rolling-stock is the most important. For some considerable time the supplies to meet these demands have been cut down to the lowest possible figure, and if this is continued for much longer the position is likely to become serious.This, with the 500,000 tons of French steel shipped direct^America, balances a steel budget of 10,000,000 tons.
If we Lad to submit for any cause to a 10 per cent, reduction on the total steel output, it is intended that (1.) Shipbuilding should remain unaltered ;(2.) 500,000 tons should come off shell steel, reducing the total shell output (taking home produced steel and foreign imported steel and shell together) by about one-sixth ; and(3.) The other 500,000 tons should be drawn, broadly speaking, pro raid, from other British services and the Allies.Every effort should be made to avert this. The out-put for 1918 in regard to shells could, however, be maintained even in the face of such reduction by exhausting reserves. This would very seriously affect the continuity of production and the output of ammuni-tion in the period immediately following that under review.    Another alternative is to diminish firings.7. Labour. The prospective labour requirements resulting from the preceding Admiralty, War Office, and Aircraft programmes amount  in the aggregate to-Skilled men, 25,000 (10,000 for aircraft). Unskilled  men, 58,000 (40,000 for  aircraft- and8,000 for steel works). Women, 70,000 (50,000 for aircraft).In addition to these demands the Admiralty are asking for 12,500 skilled men and 67,500 unskilled men ; the War Office require 15,000 artificers, of whom about 8,000 can be met from among men already in the army, leaving a balance of 7,000, of whom 5,000-0,000 have still to be supplied by the Ministry. This figure only covers the War Office demand up to November, and no information is at hand as to the very large demands for artificers which will necessarily result from the provision cf an increased equipment of guns, carriages, aeroplanes, &amp;c.A very large but at present unknown demand is also being made by the War Office, of which the ultimate dimensions cannot at present be foreseen, but which may well aggregate to 50,000-00,000 men, for the construction of aerodromes.To meet the demand for skilled men the Ministry has at its disposal a total of 210,000 transferable men, of whom over 50 per cent, are at present employed on important war Avork. Even the balance cannot be considered to be immediately available for transfer, inasmuch as a considerable proportion of them are engaged in sugar refineries, collieries, food production, and other indispensable occupations.Nevertheless, the process c  dilution is steadily, though slowly, extending, and as industries are accom-modating themselves to the war conditions the produc-tivity of a given quantity of labour tends to rise. Since the March Agreement the Ministry of Munitions have, while continually increasing output, released 53,000 general service men for the army as against 700 released by the Admiralty and 700 by War Office contracts.I am therefore advised that, so far as the demand for skilled labour for the purely munitions programme is
concerned, the requirements can be met without serious dislocation. This is, however, subject to the three following conditions: (a.) A modification of the Admiralty claim that no man can be transferred from the work on which he is at present engaged for the Ad-miralty.This demand means in effect that the whole of the skilled labour required for the new shipbuilding programme must be drawn exclusively from Munitions work.(b.) A severe limitation on the demands of the Army for recruits for artificers corps from among skilled men working on munitions.(c.) The co-operation of the skilled engineering-Unions in a more extensive dilution on war work.As regards unskilled labour, the Ministry is still due to supply 70,000 men to the Army under the agreement of last March, who would have to be replaced, and, adding these to the demands previously given, the gross number to be found is 2 .&quot;.0.000 men.There are, therefore, three main points to be con-sidered : (1.) The whole problem of recruiting as it affects the man power available for the production of munitions.(2.) The utilisation of the man power which is lying dormant in the units of the Home Service Army.(3.) An effective combing out of the Navy and of Admiralty establishments ashore, both military and civilian, similar to that which has been so thoroughly applied to Army services.I do not anticipate any difficulty in finding the women required.S. Explosives. This is even more an explosives&apos; war than it is a steel war. Steel is the principal vehicle by which explosives are conveyed to the enemy. The requirements of propellant are limited by the production of shell, but there are other methods, besides those of artillery, of delivering high-explosives to the enemy. The capacity of our existing high explosive plant is at present in excess of our shell programme for 1918. It has been arranged to supplement the present system of discharging high explosives by providing up to a maximum 1,000 tons a week of bombs to be dropped from aeroplanes. The possibility of extending the Trench Mortar offensive power of our Army is also being examined. To utilise fully our existing high explosive plants it is necessary%at we should ship from Chile approximately 788,000 tons of nitrates ;- at present the tonnage for only 600,000 has provisionally been agreed upon.New and very serious demands for T.N.T. are also being made by the Admiralty for mines.9. Chemical Warfare. Sir Douglas Haig has asked that we should add an irritant gas to our lethal and lachrymatory gases. Development of this new branch of chemical warfare will take many months and cannot
come fully into play until the end of next year&apos;s cam-paign. Using all possible resources of chemical shell with existing types of chemical, we could supply the army next year with 2% times the quantity of gas shell supplied in the 1917 campaign.If the present scheme for the new gas matures, the whole supply of chemical shell would be four times as great by the end of 1918 as in 1917.10. Guns and Ammunition. On the above basis of steel and explosives, together with importations of finished shells and components, it will, be possible to meet the Commander-in-Chiefs full demand both for guns and shells as set out in his letter of the 17th July, with the exception only of the 3-inch 20-cwt. anti-aircraft guns, which will be 20 per cent, below the requirements on the 1st April, 1918, and of the 6-inch howitzer shells on which there will be a 15 per cent, deficit over the 3^ear. The result of this artillery programme may be appreciated as follows : The average weekly tonnage of shell fired during the twenty weeks of the Somme. offensive amounted to 26,000 tons. The comparable unit for the twenty-four recorded weeks of this offensive is approximately 47,000 tons. The comparable unit for the new programme for a thirty wreeks&apos; offensive in 1918 would be 66,000 tons.This increase will be rendered possible by the arrange-ments which have been made to store ammunition on an enormous scale in this country and in France during the winter months, while keeping production at full blast. If the reserves were drawn upon until at the end of 1918 they were practically exhausted, either a slightly greater effort should be made, or the same effort could be made npon a somewhat reduced volume of tonnage and steel.The guns to fire this ammunition will be forthcoming. The relative shortage in 18-pr. and 60-pr. guns which has limited their expenditure this year, will not recur. The guns of all natures will be fully abreast of the ammunition next year with the possible exception of the 6-inch Mark XIX gun which may be slightly below requirements. It is a new-type, the life of which is not yet known.11. Before rejoicing at these facts it is necessary to compare the British, French, and German artilleries. During 1917 the French and ourselves have maintained about an equal number of combatants in the line in France, and we have done the harder fighting. The French had, however, on the 1st October 10,000 guns to our 6,000 guns, ours, on the whole, being heavier and newer. The new French heavy artillery programme is now coming into bearing, and from now on they anticipate very large monthly deliveries. By April 1918 the French will have 9,000 guns, all modern and steadily increasing. Our comparable figure in the field in France will be approaching 8,000, which is the maximum establishment that our army has at present arranged for. Our infantry will not therefore be quite so well sup-ported with artillery as the French.The War Office state that the Germans had in 1917 On the French front.. On the Russian front Balkans and Italy   ..Guns. 12,432 5,176 808Total .. .. ..      18,416[1007-4] C
The balance on the Western front was, therefore, asfollows: Franco-British ..         .. ..      15,96)German    .. ..         ..                   12,432But though we had a superiority in numbers, the Germans had superior weight of metal. Deducting from each side field guns, in which we are greatly superior, the balance in heavier and more important weapons stood as follows : Franco-British       .. .. ..        6,654German    .. .. .. ..        7,568The Germans have in particular twice as many medium howitzers and 60 percent, more heavy howitzers than the British and French put together.The Franco-British artillery in 1917 compared with the German artillery on all fronts as follows : Franco-British. German.Field guns .. ..        9,315      ..        7,908Heavier guns ..        6,654     ..      10,508Totals       ..       15,969      ..       18,416If the new British and French programmes are carried out punctually we should have in the West by April 1918, 17,000 modern and 2,000 older guns with steady increases in prospect.The Germans will have their present 12,432 guns, plus (a.) Any new programme they are making.(6.) Any of the 5,176 guns they may choose to takefrom the Russian front, (c.) Any of the 2,000 or 3,000 guns recently capturedfrom the Russians or Italians.It is certain therefore that with our utmost efforts, and under the most favourable conditions, we cannot expect any superiority in guns next year.It does not follow, however, that the ammunition for all the German guns will be as abundant as ours.Nor, on the other hand, being on the defensive, need they use it so copiously or continuously.All these facts appear to me to be wortlry of pro-found consideration.I may add that the figures supplied to me by the French Government are more unfavourable to us than those quoted from British sources.12. The most striking deficiency in the British artillery is found in very heavy long-range guns. On the 1st October the position was as follows: Very heavy guns (9&apos;2-in. and 12-in.)  German     .. .. .. ...    180French      .. .. .. ..    175British      .. .. .. ..       6There is only one source to which we can look to improve the long-range heavy battery at the disposal of our troops, viz., the Navy.If we could receive from Naval sources and from our Fortresses during the next six months 100 heavy guns (including 30 already promised), i.e., 14-inch, new 13&apos;5-inch, or 12-inch of all marks, and 100 medium guns, i.e., 10-inch and 9&apos;2-inch, it would be possible, without prejudice to the programmes, to make a very substantial addition to the British long range heavy artillery.I ask that this may be earnestly examined.
13 Aeroplanes. Tt is understood that the programme of the Royal Flying Corps provides for the equipment of the following :-?y December 1917, 85 active squadrons. Bv March     1918,106    ,, By June        1918,119    ,, By December 1918, 200   ,,&apos; This programme, together with a total of 3,000 aeroplanes required by the R.N.A.S. by August 1918 and 9,500 by the R.F.C. for training purposes, involves a total production by that date of between 27,000 and 28,000 machines of all kinds. In order to obtain this result our output in the summer of 1918 should be at the rate of 2,700 per month.&apos; . The main difficulty in meeting these demands fully and punctually is that of obtaining the requisite supply of labour. This can, however, be surmounted if the proper measures are taken now.Our maximum aeroplane production in 1918 will be 3,500 per month ; the French have stated that they are aiming at 8,0()0.14. Tanks. Tanks have never yet been used in numbers under conditions favourable to their action. Nor have we ever yet had a sufficiently reliable kind of tank, nor nearly enough of them. If they have held their own in 1917 it has been under adverse circum-stauces, both in their production here and their use in France.In consequence the army consider that they cannot allocate more than 18,500 men to the tank corps. This limits the number of lighting tanks required to an establishment of 1,080 with ample maintenance and a certain number of supply and&quot; gun-carrying tanks.There will be no difficulty in supplying this require-ment, but the new designs will not be available in full numbers until July 1918. Thereafter considerable expansions would be possible. The demand made by tanks on steel and skilled labour is small and does not sensibly affect either shipbuilding or aeroplanes.If, lor instance, the 30,00!) cavalry men now kept in France were made available for tanks towards the end of 1918 the number of these engines on the field could easily be tripled.15. Dollars. We have been forced hy the shortage of Canadian and American dollars to reduce our orders in Canada and the United States to considerably lower figures than hitherto. Shell-producing and explosives plants have had tobedemobilised in Canada almost as soon as they had been called into being, and thus we have had to do without most valuable additions to our resources for which labour and. material were available. We cannot buy more than 8 millions sterling a month on the average in 1918 from the United States, instead of an average of 13 millions in the first half of 1917; nor more than 6 millions a month in Canada, compared to 9V millions. This curtailment of our resources must be borne in mind.16. To sum up, the present adverse factors to munitions production are as follows : (1.) The increasing demands of the Admiralty.
(2.) The general shortage of labour (especially skilledlabour) and the risk of pressing labour hardat the present time. (3.) The curtailment of our orders in Canada and theUnited States on financial grounds. (4.) The low level to which we have been compelledto restrict our iron ore importations.On the other hand, the immense new plants begun in the first year of the Ministry of Munitions are being utilised to their full advantage and are steadily develop-ing their output of various munitions.The power of massed production and the increasing efficiency of diluted and female labour, together with the accumulation of working stocks and adequate reserves and the progressive elimination of commercial work, render possible a large increase in the total output so long as the necessary tonnage and labour required are forthcoming.17. In spite, therefore, of the difficulties, it should still be possible, by taking the proper measures of organisation, by enforcing the necessary economies, and bv utilising to the full the resources of every department without exception, to meet and satisfy the main demands that are made upon us.There still remain as new objectives of effort within the bounds of possibility and without undue prejudice to the above : (i.) Increased long-range aeroplane bombing power, (ii.) Increased long-range mobile and semi-mobileheavy artillery, (iii.) Increased trench mortar offensive, (iv.) Increased tank development late in the year, (v.) Increased chemical warfare supplies.18. There are, however, four principles which must be accepted and resolutely applied : (1.) The tonnage utilised for non-military imports of all kinds, including to some extent food, must be cut down.(2.) The Admiralty must endeavour to find the bulk of its own skilled labour for shipbuilding from its own extensive resources, and it must subject every part of its immense organisation to a loyal and searching scrutiny in the general interest.(3,) The dormant man-power of the units of the Home army must be made effective as an aid to transport, industry, and agriculture.(4.) The business of supply must be properly co-ordinated. We cannot afford the waste which arises from the independent and competitive action of individual departments.WINSTON S. CHURCHILL.November 1, 1917.o
