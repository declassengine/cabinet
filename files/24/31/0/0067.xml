Sir,9th November, 1917.I am commanded by the Array Council to request that no action may be taken on War Office letter Uo.092/1553 (S.D.2.) of 6th instant as it has been decided by the War Cabinet that the terms of the communication to be made to the Governor General of the Commonwealth of Australia are to be approved by the Cabinet.A copy of the draft telegram to be submitted to the War Cabinet is enclosed for the information of Mr Secretary Long.I am,Sir,The Under Secretary of State, .% Colonial Office, .Your obedient Servant,(Sgd.)   J&quot;,A,0orcoran,DRAFT T:KLS&amp;RAM..................Prom Secretary of State for Colonies, To    Governor General of Commonwealth,9th November, 1917,In continuation of my telegram of 8th October last while Australian divisions v/ere employed on the offensive front in Flanders it was not possible to consider how best to give effect to the request of Commonwealth Government that all Australian divisions should be grouped together in one Command..   It has now been arranged that four divisions shall be included in an Australian Corps and the remaining division affiliated to that Corps acting temporarily as a depot division until sufficient reinforcements are available to bring it up to strength.   All five divisions will thus be under General Birdwood&apos;s command.   Whole matter has been carefully considered by War Cabinet who regard above as best practical solution of the problem at the moment. Cabinet further hope that Commonwealth Government will find it Possible to send sufficient reinforcements to maintain all five divisions at full strength.As regards question of Staff, Army Council strongly urge that the principle of interchange of Australian and British officersshould
should &quot;be adhered t*o, but without in any way binding the Commonwealth Government to receive a fixed proportion of British Officers in Australian formations...  This principle is one to which,... Commonwealth Government in common with Gover-iments of other Overs ep, Dominions agreed when Imperial General Staff was formed and if Commonwealth Government will continue to accept it &quot;War Cabinet are satisfied that the details of its application will be ^satisfactorily arranged Between. Sir BJiaig .and General Birdwood.   Main diinpulty hitherto however has been to get Australian officers for British   1 staffs and Army Council.-would-welcome for this purpose a largely increased number of Australian officers who would of course be returned to Australian Corps when required to fill staff vacancies there..
