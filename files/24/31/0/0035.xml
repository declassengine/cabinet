The Governor General of the Commonwealth Of Auetralia to the Secretary of State for the Colonies*(Received, Colonial Office; 11*30 p.W, 30th July,.1017)4COlommonwealth of Australia desires to invite the attention of the Imperial Government to the fact that the Australian Imperial Force which at first consisted of only a few units has now for some time exceeded 100,000 in the fighting line and that it is desirable that the national feeling with regard to their troops should be given affect to more especially in relation to the constitution of the fighting formations and the employment of Australian officers on the staffs and also that to ensure oloser touch with Australian sentiments the Commonwealth should provide a senior Australian officer for duty at the War Office with regard to Australian questions..   Commonwealth of Australia requests that the above may receive earnest consideration and propose to submit details of proposals after obtaining views of His Majesty&apos;&apos;e Go vernraent on general principle.FERGUSON,COiiFIDMTIAL..121/0verseas/3871. (S.D.1.) - 6th August, 1917.Sir,With reference to a telegram from the Governor General of the Commonwealth of Australia, dated 30th July 1917, regarding the constitution of the fighting formations and the employment of Australian officers on the staffs of the Australian Imperial Force, I am commanded by the Army Council to state for the information of Mr Long that the intention of the commonwealth Government is not olear to them.    -2,    The Australian Imperial Force is organised in divisions composed entirely of Australian troops,- and, as regards the staffs, the majority of the appointments are filled byAustralian
Australian officers.   Arrangements have further &quot;been made whereby-Australian officers are attached to the staffs of both British and Australian formations with the object of qualifying for employment on the staff.3.     In this connection I an to say that the policy of the Army Council has always been to regard the Staff as an imperial organization in which officers of the Dominion forces equally with those of the British service shall be considered interchangeable, that is to say, a proportion of the appointments on the Dominion formations should be held by officers of the British service, and vice versa.4.    file only obstacle to the fulfilment of this principle hitherto has been the paucity of officers of the Dominion forces with the necessary training and. experience, but now that we are entering the fourth year of the war and with the increased facilities referred to above ftr acquiring this experience there should be little difficulty in providing a representative propor-tion of Australian officers for staff appointments both inside arid outside the Australian Imperial Force.5,     If on the other hand the Commonwealth Government contend, that none but Australian Officers should serve on the staffs of Australian formations the Council could not; but regard this as 8, retrograde step and contrary to the whole spirit of Imperial policy as regards military organization, and One which they woulvd strongly deprecate,6.     In regard to tue suggestion that the Commonwealth should provide a senior Australian officer for duty at the War Office, which is also the,subject of your letter 38174/1917 of 3rd inst,, I am to say that Lieutenant-General Sir William Birdwood has already been appointed by. the Commonwealth Government as the General Officer Commanding the Australian Imperial Force for administrative purposes and, further, that there is an Administrative Headquarters for the Force in London through which Sir William Birdwood exercises his functions.   The Officer in charge of this Administrative Headquarters (Colonel T.Griffiths, C.H.G., D.S.O.), is in the closest touch with the various departments of the War Office, and to all intents and purposes acts as the Australian representative at the War Office.*7,     The Army Council would have no objection to the appointment of a senior Australian officer for duty at the War Office if any good purpose would be served thereby, but, as matters are, such an appointment could hardly fail to complicate the existing machinery    i already set up by the Commonwealth Government for dealing with the administration of the Australian Imperial Force. &apos;I am,Sir,Your obedient Servant, (Sgd.)

39254/1917.TELEGRAM. Prom the Secretary of State for the Colonies to the &quot; Governor General of the Commonwealth of Australia.(Sent 11,35 a.m. 11th August 1917).CONFIDENT LAL.Referring to your telegram of 50th July I have consulted Army Council.   Australian Imperial FOrce is organised in divisions composed entirely of Australian troops and majority of i appointments on staffs are already filled by Australian officers,&apos; Australian Officers have been attached both to British and Australian formations with a view to qualifying themselves for staff employment.   This policy will be developed as number of officers with necessary training and experience increases, and Army Council anticipate that there will be little difficulty in future in Vproviding representative proportion of Australian officers for stafrv appointments both inside and dutVi^ei Australian Imperial Force. Army Council hope that it is not wish of your Government that none but Australian officers should serve ma staffs of Australian formations as they regard staff generally as an Imperial organisation in which officers of Dominion and British forces shall be considered interchangeable i.e, proportion rsf appointments on Dominion formations should be held by officers of British service and vice versa.As regards second part of your telegram Army Council point out that Sir William Birdwood has already been appointed by &apos; .-;.Commonwealth Government General Officer Commanding Australian Imperial Force for administrative purposes, and that there is an Administrative Head Quarters for the Force in London through which he exercises his functions.   Officer in charge of this Headquarters is in closest touch with the various Departments of War Office and to all intents and purposes acts as Australian representative at War Office.In these circumstances it is not clear that further Bpecial appointment at Wat Office is needed.    If Ministers in view of above do not concur I should be grateful for further expression of their views as to work which proposed officer should undertake.LONG.CONFIDENTIAL.Downing Street. 42620/1917, 31 August, 1917,Sir,With reference to your letter 121/Overseas/3871 (S.D.1.) of 6th August, I am directed by Mr Secretary Long to transmit to you, to be laid before the Army Council, the accompanying copy of a 5th further telegram from the Governor General of the Commonwealth of ust-Australia on the subject of the employment of Australian officers on the staffs of the Australian Imperial Force, and the appointment of a senior Australian officer for duty at the War Office.2,     Mr Long would be glad to be favoured with the observations of the Army Council on the views expressed by the Commonwealth Government,I am,Sir,Tne Secretary, Your obedient Servant,War Office.(Sgd.)

TELEGRAM. The Governor General of the Commonwealth of Australia -&quot;-   to the Secretary of State for the Colonies.  (Dated 25thAugust.) .(Received Colonial Office 7.10 p.m., 25th August, 1917).Following from Prime Minister begins (?) Confidential Government of Commonwealth of Australia is disappointed at the terms of your reply of 11th August from which it is evident that the Army Council is not in sympathy with the desire of this Government that Australian Divisions should be grouped in one or more Australian Corps with Australian Staff Officers.   This would be more acceptable to Australian sentiment than statement that Australian Staff Officers are regarded as interchangeable with British Staffs which have not previously been actually put into practice. As regards representations at War Office while Sir William Birdwood is responsible for the fighting efficiency of the Australian Imperial Force there are many questions concerning supply of war material for Australia, base and historical records, return of invalids to Australia, as well as subjects which are difficult to explain by cablegrams, and it is. considered that the services of a senior Australian Officer in London would facilitate decisions ends.MUNRO FERGUSON.CONFIDENTIAL.092/1553 (S.D.2.) 9th September, 1917.Sir,With reference to your letter No.42620/1917 dated 31st August 1917, I am commanded by the Army Council to explain that, while they are in sympathy with the desire expressed by the Government of the Commonwealth of Australia that Australian Divisions should be grouped in one or more Australian Corps, the grouping of divisions in the field is a matter which depends on tactical requirements and must therefore be left to the discretion of the Commander-in-Chief of the British Armies in France.   A single Corps of five Australian Divisions would be unwieldy, both for tactical and administrative purposes&quot;, while a Corps of less than three Divisions would be uneconomical in the matter of staff and headquarters personnel.The existing arrangenent whereby the five Australian divisions and the New Zealand Division are organised in two corps, not only maintains the traditions of the original Australian and New Zealand Army Corps, but is the most practicable means of giving effect in the largest possible measure to the desire of the Commonwealth Government that the Australian Divisions should be grouped together,2*     In regard to the complaint of the Commonwealth Government that the principle of interchange between Australian and British Staff Officers has not hitherto been put into practice, I am to say that in your telegram Ho.39254/1917 of - the 11th ultimo, no reference was made to the fact that the obstacle to such interchange has hitherto been the paucity of Australian officers with the necessary training and experience,Now, however, that we are entering the fourth year of the war and with the increased facilities for acquiring experience in Staff duties which have been arranged, there should be littledifficulty
difficultv in providing a representative proportion ofAustralian officers for Staff appoirrtiients &quot;both inside--aiid.^nrfc*-Ue^the Australian Imperial Force. ^The Council, therefore, request that this ;aay he made clear to the Commonwealth Government and that it may further he explained that they consider it essential to the Imperial character ofA t-:-e* Staff that British officers should serve on the Staff of the formations of the self-governing Dominions and vice versa, as was stated in their letter 121/Overseas/3871 (S.D.I.) of 6th August, 1917.3.     I am to add that the Council have no objection to the appointment of a senior Australian officer as the Commonwealth^ representative in London, but as the functions indicated for him are already performed by the Administrative Headquarters of the Australian&quot; Imperial Force, his position in regard to that . Headquarters should be clearly defined.     It appears to the Council that he could only carry out his duties by being placed in actual command of the Headquarters, thereby superseding the officer at present in command.I an,Sir,Your obedient Servant,The Under Secretary of Atate, (Sgd.)

JP p.m. 12th September 1917).C02.TIDFHTIAL. .:.Your telegram of 26th -August while Army Council sympathize with desire of Commonwealth Government that Australian divisions should be grouped in one or more Australian Corps grouping of divisions in the field depends on tactical requirements and must therefore be left to discretion of Commander-in-Chief British Armies in France.   A single Corps of five Australian divisions would be unwieldy both for tactical and administrative purposes while corps of less than three divisions would be uneconomical as regards staff and headquarters personnel.   Existing arrangement whereby five Australian divisions and lie?/ Zealand division are organizes in two Corps not only maintains traditions of original Australian and Hew Zealand Army Corps but is more practicable means of giving effect in largest possible measure to desire of Commonwealth Government that Australian Divisions should be grouped together.   In regard to complaint of Commonwealth Government-tiiat principle of interchange between Australian and British staff Officers has not hitherto been put into practice Army Council explain that obstacle to ouch interchange hitherto has been paucity of Australian officers with necessary training and experience.   Now however that fourth year of war entered and with increased facilities arranged for acquiring experience in staff duties there should be little difficulty in providing representa-tive proportion of Australian officers for staff anointments both msiae and outside Australian I serial Force,   Army Council-moreover consider it essential to Imperial Character of Staff-that jsritiau Officers should serve on staffs of Dominions formationsand

(Received Colonial Office 6.50 p.m.     26th September, 1917)., Following from my Prime Minister begins. With reference to your telegram of September 12th replying to request of Commonwealth Government that Australian divisions should be grouped together, I desire to emphasise point that it is strongly desired by Commonwealth Government that all Australian troops should be grouped together under command of General Birdwood and that Australian troops should be commanded and staffed by Australian officers of j-hora most have had several years war experience in addition to former peace training in Australian permanent and rail it if. forces.   This would appeal most strongly to Australian national sentiment, it is most&quot; keenly desired by the troops, the Commonwealth Government presses for it.   As to strategical objections, I cannot believe that these are insuperable in view of the fact that before my previous telegram the division 1% been detached from Anzac Co.. ps but has since been returned much to the men&apos;s satisfaction.   Should be glad if this matter could be referred to my colleagues of Imperial, Cabinet.I-itJNRO FERGUSON&quot;,i

These-questions will be discussed with him On &quot;the first convenient opportunity with the object of determining- how fa? the wishes of, the Commonwealth Governneht can-be met without detriment to railitar;- efficiency, A-further report will then-be rendered.In the meantime I desire to point out that an organizatio: of five divisions in one Corps would be  nwieidy and cumbersome, and would not fit into the system of reliefs- essential to the oaintenahce of active operations on a great scale.   It would affect the.general &apos;eo^duct of operations so adversely that I regard it   as both unwise and iixpraetlcable.In
In regard to the question of the interchange of Staff Officers between British and Australian formations, I also wish to point out that frequent offers have &quot;been made to General Birdwood to employ Australian Officers, who &quot;have qualified for staff appointments on the staffs of British formations.   These Offers have, however, been consistently declined on the grounds that until Australian formations are completely staffed by Australian officers, no Australian Officers can be spared for British formations.   This is one of the questions for discussien -&quot;N with General Birdwood when opportunity can be found, as it is of   ,: great importance to Australia and to the Empire that such officers should gain as wide an experience as possible, and the principle 4: involved is one to which the Australian Government, in common with, the Governments of the other Oversea Dominions, agreed when the Imperial General Staff was formed,I have the honour to be, Sir,Your obedient Servant,(Sgd.)

In regard to the interchange of Staff Officers between British and Australian formations, Sir Douglas Haig remarks that frequent offers have bien made to General Birdwood to eraploy Australian Officers, who have qualified for Staff appointments, on the staffs of British formations.   These offers have, however, been consistently declined on the grounds t. .at until Australian forma-tions are completely staffed by Australian officers, no Aust3?alian officers can be spared for British formations.   This is one of the questions for discussion with General Birdwood when opportunity can be found, as it is of great importance to Australia and to the Empire that such officers should gain as wide an experience as possible.The Council desire once more to represent that the principle involved is one to which the Australian Government, ino oii ion

On account of shortage of Australian reinforcements I have decided to reorganize Australian divisions into 1 Australian Corps consisting of 4 divisions with 5th division affiliated as depot division.   Present 2nd Anzac Corps will then consist of Hew Zealand division and British divisions. This involves abolishing present titles of 1st Anzac and 2nd Anzac Corps.
