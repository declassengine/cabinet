ADDITIONAL HORSE AND TROOP TRANSPORTS FOR LEDITEPRANEAN , -The utmost efforts have been made to provide the 17 additional Troop and Horse Transports for the liediterranean, approved by the War Cabinet,   Great difficulties have been met in fitting, owing to shortage of labour, shortage of material and the like.   Four of the 17 are now on service, and 12 others will be available in the Mediterranean at dates running from November 8th to November 20th, so far as can at present be ascertained.   For the last ship no definite date can yet be given.5. CONVEYANCE OF AMERICAN TROOPS TO FRANCE.Several discussions on this subject have taken place.   The importance of conveying American troops direct to Franco has been impressed upon the American representatives, and the inability of this country to deal with the transportation of considerable numbers via England has been emphasised, 6.. LEAVE SERVICE FROM FRANCE.The 7/ar Office has asked for a very large Increase in the Leave Service for the British Armies in France during the winter (an increase from 5,500 a day to 9,200 a day).   The importance of this is fully appreciated, but the gravestdifficulties
difficulties due to shortage of suitable ships, and difficulties of escort, are anticipated. CROSS CHANNEL STORE SERVICE * .Owing to the weather, enemy operations, and similar difficulties, the quantities bf stores taken into France have diminished considerably in the last two or three weeks.
