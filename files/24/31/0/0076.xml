Colonel Joces(Note by Sir E* Wyldbore Smith)I wish to offer the following observations on the .33 Memorandumfsubmitted to the War Cabinet by the Minister of National Service on the subject of the acceptance of Foreign Contracts in relation to Man powerBThe Allied Government contracts dealt with by the International Commission are cf three kinds :-(a) Contracts placed by British Government Departments or su-oolied from British Stores on behalf of the Al 1 ie d 0- o ve rnme nts o .(b) Contracts placed by the Delegates of the Allied Governments on the Commission direct with firms in this country,(c) Orders placed with firms in this country by firms in Allied Countries for material, required for the execution of their contracts with the Governments concerned 0The orders under class (c\ are comparatively insigni-ficant relating as they do only to isolated quantities of raw material, single machines, spare parts, etc., and do not, it is thought, affect the question under review.Orders under class .(b) aro becoming increasingly in-frequent as it is found more convenient on many grounds to arrange for the Allied Government supplies to be made as far as possible direct by the British Government,The most important class of contracts for the purpose of the present inquiry are those comprised under class (a).In regard, however, to all these three classes, the principle followed by the Commission is the same, viz:-that no contract shall be placod without the approval of the British Government Department concerned-Every application made by the Delegates of an Allied Government to the Director of tho Commission to obtain or to authorise the obtaining of supplies is submitted to the War Office, Admiralty, Ministry of Munitions, Air Board, as the case may be, according to the nature of the material concerned, and it is assumed that these Departments in approving or arranging for the supply of the;.&quot; material take into considera-tion questions of labour as well as those of actual supply. It would accordingly appear that any action as regards obtaining the approval&apos;of the Minister of National Service tc the contracts in question must be entirely a matter for tho Department concerned and not for the International Commission.     Should the Department concerned bo unable to provide for- tho execution of the contract   out of tho labour already allocated to the Particular trade involved, it is clearly the duty of such jZis^o^ouiganl is the Property cf His Britannic Majestyfs Government)WAR     CABINET.r.2576.Ac,21PTi:NCE 0- FOREIGN CONTRACTS IN RELATION TOMAN-POWERs
-2-352Department to approach the Minister of National Service with a view to further labour being allocated to meet the increased demands made by the Allied Government contract upon that trade.As regards the suggestion that the International Commission should be instructed to make a return of the contracts of which notice has not been given to the Adjwcant General, I would submit that this is a matter which should properly be left to the Government Departments concerned both on the above grounds and also in view of the fact that the Commission are not in a position to know which contracts have been notified to the Adjutant General and which ha&quot;ve not. The difficulty which the Commission would experience in making a return of this kind is enhanced by the fact that in certain cases issues from store have been made (requiring replacement) or contracts placed by certain Departments of His Majesty1s Government independently of the Commission, This is the case in regard to certain of the contracts for textile supplies referred   to at the foot of page 2. of Sir A. 3eddes&apos; memorandum.As regards the question of the supply of material for the Uniied States Expeditionary Force, I may perhaps be allowed to point out that the equipment of this force is   a matter of considerable urgency, and secondly   that financial considerations and more particularly the necessity for economising tonnage appear to make it imperative that as large a proportion as possible of the requirements of this force should be met from the United Kingdom.As regards the other Allies, it cannot be overlooked that they must continue to be very largely dependent upon this country for their supplies of munitions and equipment, and whatever may be the shortage of Man power, I would strongly deprecate the adoption of any principle which would involve the cutting off of labour supplies from particular industries when the requirements of the British Government alone have been satisfied.The steps which are being taken at the present moment to co-ordinate strategic action on the various fronts must necessarily be incomplete if the manufacturing capacity of this country is confined solely to the requirements of the British forces and is not equally placed ax the disposal of the Allies as a whole.(Signed) E. Wyldbore Smith,10th November, 1917
