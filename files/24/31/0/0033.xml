(This Document is the Property ofty of     /Hh Britannic Majc^ty&apos;3 Government,)SECRET, N.S.R.19.THE ACCEPTANCE OF FOREIGN CONTRACTS IN RELATIONTO MAN-POWflR.I desire to bring to the notice of the War Cabinet the question of the placing with British firms of Contracts for Allied countries in relation to Man-power.On the 5th October, 1916, the War Committee of the Cabinet recorded the following decision (Minute 3 C):-&quot;It was considored inexpedient that any foreign Powers should have the right to place big orders in this country to the possible prejudice of our own requirements In person-nel, and that, on that account, the Adjutant-General should have the opportunity of considering demands for particular supplies.It was decided that any order intended to be placed by the International Commission should be reported to the Adjutant-General by the War Office representatives on that Commission;    and that if, in his opinion, a case occurred which he thought might occasion serious injury to the supply of men, he should bring it to tho notice of the Secretary of State f6r- sfar, in the first case, who would invite the Commission to reconsider the proposed order, and Inform the War Committee for decision.The War Office have informed me that, in their opini Investigation put upon the Adjutant-General has auto-Memorandum by Minister of National Service.
matically passed to mo, as Minister of National Service. I think that the view so expressed accords with the in-tentions of the War Cabinet, and is obviously in the general interest.It has recently come to my knowledge that considora-ble contracts have been placed here by Allied countries without any previous notice to the Adjutant-General or myself.For example, an agent of the United States Government recently approached the Surveyor General of Supply,   Mr. Weir, to seek his support in getting 90,000 tons of steel with which to build hospital huts for the American troops in France.     Mr. Weifc objected to steel being used in this way, because it has been proved in practice that perfectly satisfactory huts can be built of concrete slabs, with a small quantity.of wood^ and that huts of this kind are much cheaper and do not involve the use of steel, of which the supply for essential needs is unequal to the demand. Finally, under great pressure, he recommended that 4,000 tons of steel should be allotted;     The United States agent then approached Sir John Hunter of the Steel Produc-tion Department, who authorised the supply of 30,000 tons. It is, I think, obvious that this steel could have been used to greater advantage in many other ways, and that the whole transaction shows a serious lack of co-ordination and a complete disregard of the ruling of the War Committee quoted above.Contracts have also been placed on behalf of tho United States, the Serbian and Greek Governments with
Yorkshire woollen and worsted firms for very large quantities of textile goods*     I am pressing for par-ticulars of these contracts, of the acceptance of which both the Adjutant-General and myself were entirely ignor-ant, and which arc, I believe, cf sufficient magnitude, to engage the whole man-power of the Yorkshire textile trade, which has hitherto been on short time, and which I have regarded as an available source of supply of men for the Amy ?When tho VJar Cabinet decided that it was the function of the Ministry of National Service to review tho whole field of man power, all Government Departments who are users of man-power at once agreed that I should be informed of all new departmental prcgrannes, and of all variations in existing programmes,,     Such information is essential to the V/ar Priorities Committee in determining the general order of priority, and to the Ministry of National Service in deter-mining the source from which men are to be recruited for tho Army, and the allocation of available labour to meet tho claims cf Government Departments and essential industries * But the whole of the calculations upon which the decisions of the War Priorities Committee are based, and which govern the joint action of tho Ministry of National Service and the ether Government Departments will inevitably be upset, if large contracts arc undertaken for allied countries without the Minister of National Service being consulted, I would, therefore, ask the V:ar Cabinet to reaffirm the decision of the War Committee,  that no contract shall bo placed in this country either through the Commission
-4.-Internaticnale de RavitaULlement, or directly by agents e  allied G^rnmerLtsr, without the previcua octteurrena^ of the Minister of National Service.   I would also ask that the GAmrnis-&amp;iaaJ^^instructed tc make a return of all contracts already placed for allied countries, of which notice ha3 not been given      the Adjutant-General, showing the nature of the contracts, the estimated cost, and the stage of completion reaohed.Any acticu consequent upon such a decision necessarily opens the wide question of the policy which the Government intends tp adopt with reference to supplies for the United States troops in the. field.   The figures which I have submitted to the War Cabinet in my review of the recruiting position and prospects for the coming year CN.S.R.17, dated 15.10,1?), are based on the assumption that we shall not be called upon to supply the United States Army to any appreciable extent.   If, however, this assumption is incorrect, and if this country is tc become responsible for large supplies, involving in their ma:ra-facturo the use frf a considerable amount of male labour, which would otherwise be available for recruitment, it will not In my opinion, be possible to raise the necessary drafts ts maintain the full number of British units now in the field.It may well be that it is economically desirable that many articles for the use of U.S. troops in France should be manufactured in this country.     Such a course would probably effect a saving of tonnage, and has obvious
financial advantages.       But whichever course is to be adopted,    it is I submit essential that the Government should decide as early a3 possible what classes of muni-tions, if any, are to be supplied to the United States forcos and approximately In what quantities, in order that the effect on man-power may be estimated, and that this may bo taken into account in assessing the numbers of men available for the Army and for the production of essential comm.odities.-_for our own -requirements.A.
