Colonel JonesSECRET.NAVAL WEEKLY APPRECIATION-No. 24.yEjTPeefc en^ed! Uh November./NAVAL OPERATIONS.On November 2nd a force of light cruisers and destroyers operating in the Kattegat Kattegat, destroyed the German auxiliary warship &quot; Kronprinz Wilhelm &quot; and 10 trawlers;  65 prisoners were picked up.On October 16th Submarine C.32 approached Kouivast in Moon Island to attack Baltic, the enemy, but was bombed by an aeroplane as she was about to fire.   On the 18th she fired two torpedoes at an escprted transport, one of which is believed to have hit.   She was then heavily attacked with depth charges, and was subsequently destroyed in order to prevent her falling into the hands of the enemy.On October 17th Submarine C.26 attempted an attack on two German battleships in the Baltic, hut failed through grounding in 20 feet of water.   She was refloated later.It is feared that the Russian Submarine H.14 has been lost, as she is more than three weeks overdue.The Russian Fleet in the Baltic consists of 4 Dreadnoughts, 3 pre-Dreadnoughts, 9 Cruisers, 68 Destroyers, 26 Submarines, 12 Minelayers, 46 Minesweepers and Auxiliaries. The battleship &quot; Petropavlovsk,&quot; which has shown the most mutinous tendencies of all the ships in the Baltic, is reported ashore off Helsingfors.The monitor &quot; Erebus &quot; has been damaged in the bows by an electrically-controlled Flanders German motor boat, 1 man being killed and 12 wounded.   An attack by a similar boat and Dover on the &quot; Prince Eugene &quot; resulted in the electrically-controlled boat being sunk by gunfire area-from a destroyer.Minelaying operations have been carried out in the Heligoland Bight and off the Mining Belgian Coast.   Deep minefields have been laid off the south-west coast of England.      operations.R.N.A.S. bombing squadrons from Dunkirk have carried out raids on enemy aero- R.N.A.S. dromes at St. Denis Westrem, Varssenaere, Sparappelhoek and Engel, on railway junctions Operations at or near Cortemarck, Lichtervelde, Stalhillebrugge and Ghent, on Bruges docks, on 111 Flanders factories, sidings and docks at Antwerp, and on a factory at Duren (20 miles west-south- ^ast west of Cologne).&apos; F;aaSnceiAt Antwerp several big explosions and large fires were caused, and in most cases a number of direct hits on the objectives were observed. The total weight of bombs dropped was over 13 tons.   One of our machines failed to return.In aerial fighting during the week one enemy machine was destroyed, and one shot down out of control by R.N.A.S. machines from Dunkirk.In aerial fighting, during the period 7th 20th October, R.N.A.S. squadrons Nos. 1, 8 and 10, attached to the R.E.C. in France, have destroyed or brought down in our lines three enemy machines and have driven down five out of control. They have co-operated in infantry attacks, and have fired over 5,000 rounds from altitudes of 100 to 1.000 feet at machine gun emplacements, gun emplacements, block houses and troops in the trenches and in the open, and various billets have also been bombed. Our casualties were one pilot wounded and three injured. On one occasion a single pilot, having become separated horn his patrol, attacked a formation of 14 Gothas protected by a large number of scouts and continued to engage until his ammunition was exhausted.During the quarter ending 30th September the work of No. IV Wing R.N.A.S. (Squadrons Nos. 3, 4, 9 and 11), whose main duty is to protect the left flank of the Army, resulted in 14 enemy machines certainly destroyed, 30 probably destroyed and 9 partially disabled. There were 124 indecisive engagements, and in addition enemy aerodromes were attacked on two occasions by machine gun fire from low altitudes with good results. Our casualties were two killed, six missing and four wounded, and two killed accidentally.(C747)   50   11/17   H&amp;S[This Docnment is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.] f; &quot; 28Printed for the War Cabinet.

Black Sea.Mediter- On October 30th the monitor &quot;Raglan&quot; bombarded the Turkish military stationranean. at ;perr Sineid (7 miles N.N.E. from Gaza and 3f miles inland). An ammunition dump was destroyed, the explosions lasting half an hour; the railway bridge also was completely destroyed and the road bridge damaged. The enemy positions on the sea front were also fired on by other of H.M. ships, and wire entanglements placed out of sight of military observation destroyed.Russian destroyers, operating off the Anatolian coast have sunk an enemy torpedo boat and two steamers in Inda Bay, and it is reported that a battery ashore was put out of action.ATTACK UPON ENEMY SUBMARINES.Submarines During the week under review 7 to 11 large enemy submarines have been out, of operating, which 4 to 8 have been operating to the west of Home Waters, one in the Arctic, and one in the vicinity of the Cape Verde Islands where two Brazilian ships at anchor were torpedoed. There has been practically no activity in open waters and such activity as has been experienced has been chiefly confined to the Yorkshire Coast, the Irish Sea and the English Channel.Actions The following Table shows the number of actions with enemy submarines in Homewith enemy Waters during recent weeks, the nature of the craft which have engaged them, and submarines. aiso ^he number of submarines destroyed by mine : 	Week ended		1 \   Week	ended	Week ended		Week	ended	Octobe	r14th.	&apos;   October 21st.

The number and tonnage of vessels both British and Allied and Neutral lost by enemy action during the week under review are the lowest on record since the commencement of unrestricted submarine warfare. On two separate days during the week no vessels were reported to have been sunk or molested by enemy submarines, these being the first &quot; nil5&apos; returns since the beginning of February.The total tonnage sunk during the week was little more than a quarter of that sunk three weeks ago.The table in Appendix I shows in detail the numbers and tonnage of sailings and of Losses of losses by submarine and mine, and the percentage of losses to sailings of British Merchant British steamships of over 500 tons gross register, and the table in Appendix II shows by trades ^e^^ps as regards such ships the percentage of tonnage sunk by submarine and mine to tonnage sailing to and from United Kingdom ports during the last three weeks.From these tables it will be seen that the British losses in overseas trades have this week been confined to the Bay and the Eussian trade, the Atlantic and Gibraltar trade having been immune from attack. Although the total tonnage at sea during the week was considerably less than in many previous weeks, nevertheless the percentages of tonnage lost to tonnage sailing are much lower than in any previous week since the commencement of unrestricted submarine warfare, the figure as regards the total oversea traffic to and from the United Kingdom being only .73 as compared with the previous record of 1.34, and as regards all traffic to and from United Kingdom ports being .42 as compared with the previous record of .69. It must be noted, however, that the number of large submarines operating has been less than in previous weeks.The table in Appendix III is a comparative statement of all British Merchant Vessels Areas in sunk, damaged or molested, and of all Allied and Neutral Merchant Vessels sunk in the which last two weeks by enemy craft and by mine according to areas.vessels lost.ENEMY MINES.The minelaying activity of the enemy has this week been experienced chiefly off the Minelayin^. South-East Coast of England and in the neighbourhood of Beachy Head and the Needles. There are strong reasons for believing that the enemy is scattering his mine&apos;s very much more widely than hitherto, and this week four reports have been received of submerged mines in localities which are outside ordinary traffic routes and are not normally swept.This policy of scattering mines will throw additional work on the mine-sweepers but the risks to shipping will probably be less than if the mines were concentrated in thickly mined areas.The fact that the enemy is now laying delay release mines has been confirmed and in some cases so much as a four-day interval may elapse between the time of laying and release of the mine to take its normal depth. This difficulty can only be overcome by a bottom sweep which in many localities is rendered difficult owing to the existence of rocks and wrecks. Assistance in detecting these mines has been given by hydrophones which hear the mines being laid.The following table shows the number of Enemy Mines destroyed and British Vessels Casualties, sunk by mine in Home Waters in recent weeks : Week Ended.

/DEFENCE AGAINST SUBMARINE AND MINE.Convoy, During the week 823 ships have been convoyed as compared with 651 last week.Of the 823 ships convoyed, 442 were engaged in the French coal trade, and 142 on the Scandinavia-Berwick-Humber route, the remaining 239 being engaged on overseas trade, 141 inward and 98 outward. There have been three losses in convoy one due to collision in the Gibraltar inward convoy, one a Swedish vessel in the Scandinavia convoy, , and one engaged in the French coal trade.Defensive During the week 25 additional merchant vessels have been fitted to take defensivearmament,  armament, the number at present fitted being 3,389.The number of guns now available amounts to 3,080.Offensive The number of howitzers and bomb throwers delivered during the week is 47, makingarmament.  tne totai delivered to date 228.Mine pro- During the week 60 additional merchant ships have been fitted with Otter equipment.tectiongear. bringing the total number so fitted up to 707.Dazzle An additional 32 vessels have been dazzle painted, making a total of 213.

FOREIGN NAVAL INTELLIGENCE. Uruguay.An Uruguayan merchant vessel was sunk at the beginning of November. It is possible that this may lead to a declaration of war.Uruguay has 1 light cruiser and 1 torpedo gunboat. Permission was recently given for Uruguayan naval officers to attend firing practice on board H.M.S. &quot; Glasgow.&quot;Cuba.Cuba is co-operating satisfactorily with U.S.A.A light cruiser and a&apos; gunboat are refitting and rearming at a U.S. port with a view to forming part of a patrol to the entrances of the Gulf of Mexico. Tliis patrol will be assisted by a seaplane base at Key West to control the North Channel and another base is projected at the western extremity of Cuba to watch the passage between Cuba and Yucatan. In the event of trouble with Mexico or the appearance of enemy submarines in West Indian waters, the efficiency of these patrols would be most important.The Cuban navy consists of : 1 light cruiser. 4 gunboats. 14 revenue cutters.Naval Staff,8th November, 1917.[Appendices.
