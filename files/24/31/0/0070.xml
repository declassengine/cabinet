Diaz has net yet got command of situation, ncr confident senior generals; result is indecision and lack of coherent plan. I have seen Diaz, Giardinc, Porro and Generals and staff of 1st, 4th and 3rd Armies as well as other officers cut in front and also Oavan and Hamilton.      In ray opinion Italians will fall back If any determined attack is made on line Piave,       I am pressing for other lines to be prepared In rear, on the Brenta, along the hill between Vicenza and Padua and behind the Adige. Diaz agrees to do this.     &quot;henOadorna ordered the 4th Army to fall back south of Peltre on to Mount Grappa he made the Piave line near Pederobba very difficult to hold.       Diaz is trying to rectify this by occupying Hill north of Feltre. I doubt if thisv.rill be possible. I have been much pressed to bring(? our) concentration forward to Vicenza, This I haverefused.     The leading division will detrain at Mantua and only if the situation is favourable will it march to Verona, where next division can then detrain.     I am most anxious to do all I can to save Piave line and so save Venice and the Adriatic,    Suggest that a fifth and sixth division be got absolutely ready, but not sent unless I telegraph, We must be prepared to clothe men for theMountains and nule transport for two divisions on French scale;&apos; Alpine troops should be got ready.       Porro tells me he has been appointed military member of the Supreme Council but temporarily or permanently 1 have not been able to find out. This would be a bad appointment. The best would beDuke of Aosta.      The heavy rain is good and. will help to save situation but I do not think that a determined attack on Piave will be withstood until the French or our troops get up there.       This cannot be before about November 20th to November 25th.      If the Piave is lost in the next few days there is little chance of stopping the enemy until he reaches line of the Adige though we can delay hjn considerably if positions are properly prepared.Position is not desperate, but only a little anxious and we are doing what we can to encourage Italians meanwhile to hold to the Piave. I have asked Cavan to send six smallparties each one officer and six&apos; men to be taken along the line to hearten the troops.Addressed C.I.G.S,,for the information cf Secretary War Cabinet; repeated Military Attache, Paris, for the information of Prime Minister. .
