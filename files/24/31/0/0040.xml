to198Intelligenoe Bureau,Department of Information.FSW/013.V/ESXIY   REPORT   01?   SPAIN,    XIII.(Nov.  7th,  19&amp;7)One of &quot;the features of the war has &quot;been the contrast, often remarked by the Germans themselves, between their military success and their almost unrelieved diplomatic failure.     On fche whole, except in the Balkans where their work was half done before the war began , their representatives have steadily lost influence in neutral countries, as may be seen above all in North and South America.     Unhappily Spain must be regarded as another partial exception to the general rule.     The Germans there have been ex-tremsly active throughout the war.     They have the cupr*ort of a large portion of the aristocratic, official and clerical world: they have been at the pains to obtain the control of aome important newspapers:   and they have at their disposal an army of agents recruited from the very numerous Germans who have had to seek refuge in Spain since the war.     Probably they scarcely aimed at so high a msrk as that of bringing Spain into the war on their side.     But they have aimed, no doubt, at using aristocratic dislike of the democratic note struck by the Allies, royal fears aroused by events in Russia and Greece , military admiration of the German Army and dislike of free institutions, clerical hatred of French anti-clericalism,and the general resentment of French policy towards Spain in the Morocco business, as levers for getting influence and using it against the Allies.     And it must be admitted that they have more or less succeeded.   Not only, aided by the folly of some French enthusiasts, have they managed to embarrass the Government and injure the Allies who desire Spanish produce, by stirring up strikes and an attempt at
Revolution, &quot;but whenever j Government,  like tint oi Count Roraanc-nes in the spring, and that of Senor lute nor&apos;, shews itself determined to insist on Germany respecting the rights of Sp.;in, a crisis has he en brought about by ono mesns or another.     When Count Romanones was prepared to proceed from words to action %n his protest against the German submarine campaign, he fell.     When Dato had not only issued e decree interning German submarines who entered Spanish ports, but h&quot;i insisted, in spite of angry remonstrance from Berlin, on the rc-c.&apos; 11 of the Germ..n Naval attache who ws mixed uo in the affair of the recent escaoe of the submarine from Cadiz:   when he was even believed to threaten to give the German Ambassador his passoorts unless the submarine was returned, he :lso suddenly, rnd to his own groat surprise, received what he regarded .s his dismissal from the King.     It may ; lso be noted, perhaps ..s a coincidence, pernsps as i. c something more, that both   Count Romanoncs and Senor Dato &quot;rere got rid of when they wore on the point of signing c. convention with Great Britain as to the trade between the two countries.     On the whole it must be admitted that, for once, Germany has been able to accompany a great military victory with a contemporary diplomatic success and perhaps the first may have contributed to the second.In the Reoort of Oct. 26th it was remarked that the restoration of the Constitutional Guarantees seemed to indicate that the country was settling down and the Ministry feeling itself safer and stronger. Aid so thought Senor Dato himself only a day or two before he fell. In a private conversation on Oct. 25th he expressed the opinion that the difficulty with the Army Committees (Juntas) had been settled by a 3ort of compromise between their views and thoseJDf the Govern-iient, and he was intending to dissolve Parliament in the ordinary &apos;7ay.     Both he and the Marquis Lema had made no secret of their knowledge that the German influences were bent on turning them out,
for various reasons and especially on account of their attitude in the matter of interning the submarines ana&quot; the subsequent escape of one- of them.     This question produced a very sharp altercation between Senor Dato and the German Ambassador, who had the effrontery to allege that the Decree was a breach of International Law to which Senor Dato, while denying the assertion, very pointedly replied by asking whether German conduct in Belgium had shown any regard for International Law. 3uch -a-ee-n-v creation obviously indicates a state of considerable tension: and this was almost certainly, as in the case of Count Homanones, one of the causes which led to Senor Dato!s fall on Oct. 27th, two days after the conversation in which he had expressed him-self so hopefully.It is impossible to be sure of the exact part played by other causes.     The Marquis Alhucemas fell in the summer because he did not dare to meet the Cortes.    Senor Dato was obviously equally unwilling to meet them till he had reshaped them to his liking.   A still more important part was played in both cases by the aotion of the Army. The Zing told the Italian Ambassador on Oct. 27th that he had no al-ternative but to act in the sense desired by the Army, and he appeared at this time to be entirely under the influence of the Juntas.     It is this influence (with the help, no doubt, of occult German intrigue) which gave the final blow to Senor Dato.     It does not appear that the soldiers had any special animosity to Senor Dato personally, though  hey resented his action in refusing to allow the Deputy Domingo to be tried by Court Ltartial, action in which he has now been justified by the decision of the Supreme Court.     But they disliked his colleague Senor Guerra, who had sent out a circular which they had considered insulting to the Army:   and there was probably alst a difficulty as to their desire to present their petition to the King directly and not through the Minister of War.     In neither case would
Senor Dato yield to them and the result is his fall.     It is said that 3 days later the message of the Juntas was delivered privately to the Xing in a park near Madrid and proved professional and unobjectionable.So it may have been so far as words go.     But in political negotiations what is understood is often more important than what is expressed - And in other documents communicated te the Press lately the officers have not merely demanded the ostracism of certain Generals whom they disliked, and publicly patronised General Marina whom they had forced upon Senor Dato as Minister of War; but they had announced their intention of bringing about a change in existing political methods.     This is what they have in fact done. They dismissed Senor Dato by inducing the King to use language to him implying that he no longer possessed His Majesty&apos;s Confidence. And after a prolonged crisis they have, directly or indirectly, brought about the formation of a kind of Cabinet totally new in Snain, whose members are taken from various parties.It is not necessary to go into the details of the crisis.     The King consulted the various leaders in the usual way and it was soon clear that the solution he or the Juntas desired was that of a Cabinet of Concentration:   and indeed thas was probably the best or only possible solution.     Senor Sanchez de Toca, a former Conserva-tive Minister, who had publicly expressed his sympathy with the Allies, was entrusted with the task of forming such a Cabinet.     But in the end the only leader who would j^in him was Count Romanones. After a failure by Senor Maura, the Marquis Alhucemas has succeeded in forming a Ministry.     How long it will last is very doubtful, as he is the Prime Minister who came in conflict with the Juntas at Barcelona in the summer and had in consequence to give way to Senor Dato.     It is formed on a different system to that attempted
by Senor Sanchez de Toca, who tried to gather the leaders round him. The present Cabinet contains only one politician of note besides the premier.     That is Senor La Cierva, who is hated by the Radicals and Republicans as having been Minister of the Interior under Senor Maura and thus responsible for the execution of their hero Ferrer.      is appointment was no doubt dictated by the officers;   and it may be an astute choice on their part, :;s h*   is a man of courage and ability and the first Civilian to hold the War Office in Spain.     He has *  to lately held a middle position between the official Conservative party under Lato and the reactionary wing who follow Maura.     Five of the nine Ministers have never held office before.     Senor Prida the new Minister of Justice is favourably remembered in Engliea diplomatic ciroles as having shown great industry and impartiality as arbitrator between Germany anff England in the Walfisch Bay dispute.     He is, more or less, a follower of Senor Maura:   but he is a man whose character is more important than his political party.     Senor Bahamonde, the Minister of Interior, is said to be an insignificant man,     Senor Zamora the Minister of Public Works, who unfortunately will deal with shipping, is &amp; strong pro-German.     He owns the paper 21 Lia,     Both these are members of the Prime Minister^ own party. Senor Gimeno, a follower of Count Romanones, and naturally a man of pro-Ally sympathies, is Minister of Marine.     The Prime Minister himself takes the Foreign Office.     Thus the Cabinet includes re-; preeentatives of all official narties except the regular Conserva-tives under Senor Late ^-ho declined to join but promise supoort. The two most significant appointments, however, are those of two men from outside the official parties, two Regionalists, Senor Ventosa, who becomes Finance Minister, and Senor Rodes, ^ho undertakes Educa-tion.     They are members of Parliament but are quite outside the old political system and their names, especially that of Senor Rodes, are
lieved by their friends to be absolute guarantees that the prime inister comes in on a programme of far-reaching constitutional re-form, and that he will immediately hold free elections whi&amp;h will give as true a reflection of the mind of Spain as the inertness   nd the inexperience of m.ny of the people will  -How.     They prophesy th t the result will be the return of many democratic regionalists :;nd re-formers, not hostile to the Monarohy, but determined to make an end of the present political system.All this, however, lies in the future; for while the Government announces that it will call a new Parliament it has not so far fixed any date for a dissolution.     The whole Internal &quot;situation, in faot, including the survival of the Cabinet, depends on the attitude of the officers who are so much the de facto   rulers of the country that from the most opposite quarters of extreme Socialism and extreme Conservatism the suggestion has been made that the King should send for Marquez the leader of the Juntas, and call upon him to accept re-sponsibility as well as power.     This advice was actually given by an ex- Minister to the Xing.     Those who give it think it the only means of bringing the soldiers to reason.     What the present attitude of the officers is remains extremely obscure.     On the one hand the Parlia-mentsry Left is very anti-military and regards the appointment of La Cierva as a challange;   and the Army suppressed the Revolution vigorously.     On the other there is a real belief in some liberal quarters that the reforming professions of the soldiers are sincere, and the fact that a Cabinet formed almost at their dictation contains two such men as Rodes and Ventosa.goes some way to confirm this.As to Foreign Policy probafely no great change will take nlace. Alhucemas is less able, less honest and decidedly less pro-Ally than4Senor Dato.     He wrecked the first Cortina treaty.     But he claims
(that he will continue Dato&apos;s policy and recalls what he regards asstrong attitude towards Germany in the affair of the shipPatricio.     Probably no open change will take place, but such changeas does occur will be for the worse.     German influences helped tobring about the crisis, and they will be fortified by events in Italy.But on the other hand even Maura, half pro-German as he is, has alwaysemphasised the need of a good understanding with the Western Powers:and the indignation at the German breach of honour in the matter ofanthe submarine is so universal that it is not/easy moment for a move in the German direction.     Nothing can be more significant than that the Carlist leader, Yasquez Mella, the most Germanophil of Spaniards, went to see Senor Dato lately and, to Dato&apos;s surprise, expressed his profound disgust at the German press campaign of 3lander rnd above 11 at the ;bomin..ble conduot of the officer who broke hir. pcrole. And if :2uch a mm as Mo 11a felt like that, what must othcro feel?
