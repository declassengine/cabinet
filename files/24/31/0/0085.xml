Colonel Jones        \1This document is tho property of His Brltcanlo Me.Jest?13 Government,s431ggC R E T WAR CABINET,G fP, - 2585.&quot;&quot;^ &apos; WAR   PRIORITIES    COMMITTEE.(Note &quot;by General Smuts ). &apos;The Minutes of the Second Meeting (G.T.2468), the Third Meeting (G.T.2510) and the Fourth Meeting (G.T.2495) have already been circulated to my coller.ga.os.     The approval of the V/ar Cabinet to the decisions reached by the War Priorities Com-mittee is a matter of some urgency.I would invite speci&amp;l reference to the following points which require particular attention.Second Meeting (G.T.2468)(a) The Reduced Airship Programme.     The Minister of Munitionswished his emphatic dissent from this decision to be recorded.     His reasons for dissenting and the Admiralty reply to his Note have been circulated (GDT.2534)e(b) The Reduced Airship Programme and the Aeroplane Programme,viz.  00 squadrons to be completed by the end of 1918, to hove priority after the Shipbuilding Programme,(c) A completion of the two aircraft programmes is- sufficientlyimportant to justify &amp; reduction in the output of other munitions, e.g. shell and rails.Third Meeting (&quot;G.T.2510),Minute 4. &apos; &quot;The Committee agreed that it was unreasonable &quot;to esk the War &quot;Cabinet to furnish them with a complete and &quot;inflexible War.Plan for the future.     They felt, however, that &quot;if they were usefully to fulfil their functions, it was necess-&quot;ary to know whether a supreme effort to bring the war to an -&quot;end was to be made in 1918, or whether provision should bo made &quot;for a prolongation of the war Into 1919 and after,     In the &quot;former event it would be possible to   draw upon the huge reserves &quot;which were being piled up of shells etc, and of which the &quot;expenditure, during the winter, would be comparatively limited, &quot;in order to divert labour and material to other essential &quot;servicesi:e,g.. shipbuilding and aircraft.&quot;In this connection attention is invited to a Memorandumby Mr,Churchill, entitled &quot;Munitions Possibilities of 1918&quot;( G.T.2436).Fourth Meeting (G.T,2495) Minute 3.     The Committee recommended that the Minister
of National Service should &quot;become a Member   of the war Priorities Committee.This is necessary, as the decisions of the Committee necessarily hang upon the proper allocation of material and man-pov/er.(Initialled)    J.CS.2., Whitehall Gardens, S.W 12 November, 1917.
