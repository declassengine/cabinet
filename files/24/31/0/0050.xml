Street, V London, S.W. (1)7 th November, 1917,ill(This, DocumentHi.? Bntanntc Sir,        .^J,..^v^---I beg to submit the following Report on the work of thePood Production Department for the week ended 6th November:-The Weather.Broadly speaking the weather reports for last week were rather more satisfactory, although in certain parts of the country a great deal of rain fell.     Over the larger part of the North of England end in Wales it was wet on most days.     In the South of England the temperature has been higher but there has been much fog and rain.     In the Midlands the weather was markedly better, though in some parts there were heavy rains at night in the latter part of the week.The reports received indicate that while a fair amount of ploughing has been done during the week, the conditions were generally unfavourable except on the lighter lands.LOCAL ORGANISATION DIVISION. Agricultural Executive Committees. Derelict Farms.    The West Suffolk Committee have-been authorised to take possession of a 50 acre farm at Great Barton which was recently vacated by the tenant and has since not been cultivated. The Committee will work this farm together with an adjoining farm which has been in their possession since last April.     The Dorset Committee have been authorised to take possession of a derelict farm of 44 acres at Toller Whelm and will arrange for its cultivation by a neighbouring farmer.
Change of Tenancy.   Some of the Committees have found it necessary, where a tenant is about to quit the farm at the end of the year or at Ladyday, to take possession of that part of the farm which requires cultivation immediately and to arrange for the incoming tenant to cultivate as their agent, the outgoing tenant being unwilling to carry out any cultivation. Proposals for action of this kind by the Somerset and North Riding of Yorkshire Executive Committees have received sanction during the week.Parks-and Home Farms.    In Cornwall, Lord Falmouth has ploughed up and fenced nearly 40 acres of his deer park at Tregothnan. Golf Links.    In Kent, the Committee have induced the landlord of the Hengrove Golf Course by arrangement with the Club to take over 50 acres of the land previously occupied by the Club and to cultivate them himself.Damage by Game.   Action under the Pheasants Order is reported from Hampshire, Kent, Norfolk and the North Riding of Yorkshire.-......in i   mm i      i mi    mm- -urn,   n mn wi      in * -m mmm h i  i i       .   Smm mm m i    mmm........ - rand under the Rabbits Order from Norfolk.Drainage.    In West Suffolk the Executive Committee have commenced the work of oleaning out the River fcynn and its tributaries by prisoner labour.   The Essex Committee are examining the question of the cleansing of the Chelmer, while the Lancashire Committee are considering the improvement of the Heckcth water-courses in addition to other schemes already in preparation. Determination of Tenancies. During the week 17 Orders have been made authorising landlords to determine tenancies on account of bad farming in respect of 837 acres, and 5 Orders have been made by the Board determining the tenancies of 519 acres. Provision of Land for Allotments. Reports from 1,093 districts have now been received, showing that 199,971 applications were made for plots, and 181,036 plots have been provided under the Cultivation of Lands Order, 1917, (No.2),       The total area of the plots
pr&amp;Vi&amp;ed under the Order is 13,307 acres.HORTICULTURAL DIVISION.Inspection of Camps.    Officers of the Department have been engagedin inspecting the numerous camps in different parts of the country,and report that the Commanding Officers have not only expressedthemselves satisfied with the results of potato spraying, but havealso asked for lectures to be given during the winter to the menengaged in the cultivation in their camps.A letter has been received from the Navy and ArmyCanteen Board expressing its thanks for the work of the Departmentin this direction.Potato Spraying.    A scheme for potato spraying for next year has been prepared and has been submitted to the Treasury.   The scheme provides for the carrying out of further propaganda on an extensive scale.Vegetable Drying.    Preparations are being made for the installing of plant in Selby (two units), Pershore, Formby, Cheltenham and Kidderminster.Fruit Pulping.    Pulping of apples is being continued at Totnss, Bridgwater,   Marston Magna Fruit Farm, Haidstone, Newport, Bewdley, Cheltenham and Cambridge.Manufacture of Commercial Alcohol.  Preliminary tests having proved satisfactory, the Department has arranged for a test on an extensive scale involving the utilisation of 500 tons of potatoes to be carried out by Mr. Archibald V/alker, Chairman of the Distillery Company, Greenock, Scotland.The possibility of the use of potatoes for this purpose depends upon the price at which potatoes can be delivered at the factory-   At the present price of alcohol they must be delivered at a little over  3 per ton unless a financial loss is to be incurred in the manufacture of commercial alcohol.Arrangements have now been definitely made for the transfer to the Ministry of Food of the staff of the Division
which is employed in connection with the preservation of vegetables and fruit on a large (as distinct from a domestic) scale, and the Office of Works is engaged in finding suitable offices for its ac c ornmod. at i on.TECHNICAL DIVISION. Improvement of Arable Land.   The frequent rains of the past three months have encouraged weeds and prevented autumn cleaning.     The bad condition of the arable land in many districts is being put forward as a reason for not breaking up grass land, and is thus injuring the progress of the ploughing programme.     There are reasons for claiming that the condition of the arable land makes grass ploughing even more necessary in the national interest than before, but these reasons run contrary to the interests of owners and occupiers of land, and it is certain that, unless steps  are taken to improve arable land in the worst districts, the tillage programme will suffer.     Suggestions have been put forward for dealing with exhausted arable land by extending the procedure under the Cultivation of Lands Orders,Inspection of Land,   The infertile farm in Northamptonshire mentioned in last week&apos;s report has been inspected, by Dr. Russell, and a report submitted.     The sterility of the land is largely accounted for by continued exhaustion when the land was in arable and wetness and sourness since it has been under grass.     Soil samples have been taken and a careful analysis will be made to see if any more positive factor is at work.Insecticides,   Arrangements have been made for testing the soil insecticides Vaporite and Naphthalene on a farm at Belsay in Northumberland,LABOUR DIVISION. Supply of Horses in Charge of Ploughmen;    The Treasury have sanctioned the appointment of a Horse Officer in each county who will be able to devote his whole time to the work in connection with the Department1? scheme for the supply of horses with ploughmen to
gassist farmers in bringing additional land under cultivation.    It       E will be his duty to see that the horses let out to farmers are being properly cared for, and he will organise the &quot;gang&quot; system, that is, the system by which horses and men are stationed at Central 1 Depots and sent out daily to assist farmers.   The County Agricultural Executive Committees have been asked to nominate candidates suitable for these appointments.The Horse Scheme has been modified during the week so as to permit of Committees in certain cases working the Scheme on an acreage basis as regards payment where gangs of teams are working daily for farmers.Soldier Labour.   The soldiers are still arriving very slowly at the Distribution Centres,- and at some of the Centres outstanding demands have not been met.   The number of men now out with farmers is 10,493 so-called &quot;skilled&quot; and 10,762 unskilled.It must be pointed out, however, that of the &quot;skilled&quot; men supplied, only 20 per cent   are skilled ploughmen.   The remainder, consisting of men who have had some agricultural experience and of men accustomed to managing horses in towns, require training before they can be sent out as ploughmen.   The number under training together with the staff at the Distribution Centres account for approximately 1,500 men bringing the total number of so-called &quot;skilled&quot; men who had arrived at the Distribution Centres at the end of last week up to 12,000.   This figure should be compared with the 21,500 skilled men whom the Cabinet decided should be supplied before the end of July last for the purposes of the 1918 Programme in England and Wales.   This shortage of skilled men is having a most serious effect on the Departments efforts to Increase the area under cultivation this autumn.   Each skilled man short means thatj      food production is losing the work of two horses and a ploughman.I      Moreover the inability to provide skilled men is paralysing theDepartments efforts to extend the operations of the horse system. -The number of men sent out for training as Tractor Drivers and Ploughmen during the week was 77, making a total of 1,207
supplied for such training to date. In addition, 183 have been sent out for work with steam ploughing or threshing tackle.with regard to the training of men as horse ploughmen, reports received from the District Commissioners shew that 23 Training Schools have now been opened by the County Executive Committees, and that in 15 other counties men are being trained with farmers .Horses. Orders for the issue of 233 horses were sent out during the week, making a total of 3,352 horses to date.Prisoners of War. One additional Agricultural Prisoner Camp was opened during the week, and a scheme for a further additional Camp to employ 100 prisoners was sent to the War Office.Women&apos;s Branch.It is reported from almost every part of the country that the demand for women farm labour is at the present time considerably greater than the supply.    In many instances this can be traced to the counter needs and attractions of other war work which is often more highly paid than farm work.There is an increasing demand for women really proficient in milking and in the care of horses. It is noticeable that the fears of those who prophesied at the beginning of the year that the greater number of women engaged on farm work would be unemployed by the end of October have not yet materialised.6,672 women as members of the Land Army are accounted for as follows:-In Training Centres ..............   264On farm work .....................5,693Employed by the Forage Dept ......    404Employed by the Timber Supply Dept   144 Waiting for references to beplaced in Training Centres .....     35Waiting for employment in Depots.: 28 Waiting in their own homes .......    104The women waiting for employment are either sick or filling in a gap of a day or two between terms of employment.Reports of women training for motor tractor drivers continue to be most satisfactory.   The Tractor Representative in Wiltshire who has already trained four has appointed as Forewoman
a woman-trained at one of the Department&apos;s Training Centres.There has been a large demand for Group Leaders to organise gangs for potato-lifting:.and.jroot.-pullingi which work should continue well into December. It has been decided during the winter months to employ Group Leaders to assist in the supervision of members of the Land Army as well as in the organisation of local labor?/. demonstration of women&apos;s farmwork has been arranged to take place in West Kent at the end of this month.The scheme of co-operation between this Branch, the Timber Supply Department of the Board of Trade and the Forage Committee of the War Office is now in operation.It has been felt for some time that the Women&apos;s War /gricultural Committees set up originally by the Board of Trade were not as fully representative as they might be of the various classes and interests concerned in the agricultural life of the counties, and a suggested scheme for their re-constitution on a permanent and democratic basis has been sent to the Committees. The response already received shows that the County Committees are prepared to adopt the suggestions made to them, Women1s Institutes.   Several meetings have been held to start Women&apos;s Institutes in Warwickshire and a visit has been paid to the Tyson Women&apos;s Institute.     This most successful Institute is   -entirely run by farmers&apos; wives;   no outside help is received and the programme is carried out by the members themselves.   During the week many recently formed Women&apos;s Institutes have been visited and advice criven1 by the Institute Organisers.MECHANICAL CULTIVATION DIVISION.The following statement shews the present positionwith regard to the supply of Notor Tractors:-Up to and including October 27th.................. 1,618Consiqninf instructions driven duringthe week.........,......... 54On offer to counties ............................ 52Ceisio-ned to Scotland .... 106&quot;          &quot;   Ireland....._70 .................. 1761,900SUPPLIES DIVISION.Supplies Sub-Committees.   Twelve visits have been paid by theInspectors-of this Division during the week.     The list of- .7. -
Approved Agents- will- be- oomple^ted by-next, week-and printed lists will then be issued.Sulphate of Ammonia.   Distribution of Sulphate of Ammonia is proceeding sntisfactorily. - The Distribution Committee reports that 1,320 tons were, allocated lest week, Basic Slag.   A.number of complaints have been received as to the slow delivery of basic slag owing to the shortage of railway trucks and sheets.     These complaints are due to the urgency of the demand for basic slag for use in connection with the winter sowing of wheat, but generally speaking the di3tri-bution is not unsatisfactory.     It is believed that special efforts are being made by the Railway Companies to move slag as fast as possible..     The manufacturers hnve been instructed to give preference to orders for supplies which are stated to be required in connection with sowing.Lime..   One of the largest firms in the trade is reported to have increased the price of lime from 3/6 to 5/- per ton during the past week.     The Ministry of Munitions has been consulted as to the possibility of regulating the price of lime.     The Ministry, however, does not buy lime direct and, in view of the very heavy demand for use in the manufacture of iron and chemicals it does not seem possible to prevent a rise for agricultural purposes.Stable Manure,   Enquiries have been made by the Inspectors with regard to the accumulations of stable manure from Army Camps in Surrey, Hampshire and Dorset. Generally speaking the position is that all manure now made is being removed, but there are one or two dumps accumulated in the early part of the war, with which it has not since been possible to deal.The Hampshire -Agricultural Executive Committee is taking active measures(in connection with the matter, and has obtained orders from local farmers for 19,000 tons to be taken from a dump at Pitt Corner near Winchester.     This manure is distributed within a radius of 5 miles at 3/6 per ton, the
I 1iArmy providing horses and wagons, and the Committee lending soldier labour from the Winchester Depot.The disposal of the very large dump at Eelmoor, near Aldershot, still presents great difficulties.     The Hampshire Committee have appointed a Sub-Committee to discuss the matter, and a meeting of farmers is being arranged to advise on the subject.     The demand for manure in the locality appears to be fully met, and until the Canal is repaired there does not appear to be any&apos; great prospect of the surplus being absorbed in Hampshire.     The matter has been brought to the notice of the Surrey Agricultural Executive Committee, with a view to utilising it in that county.     The Military Authorities appear to be thoroughly alive to the importance of disposing of the manure and are only too anxious tc get rid of it wherever local conditions allow,Nitrate of Sodac    An Order has now been issued by the Ministry of Munitions controlling the supply of Nitrate of Soda.     Before the Order was issued the Department obtained an assurance from the Ministry, that the Order would not be used in a way to interfere with the sale of Nitrate for agricultural purposes. Potash - Representations have been made to the Ministry of Munitions with regard to the Potassic Compounds Order, which prohibits the purchase and sale of Sulphate of Potash and other preparations containing more than 10$ potash, except by licence from the Ministry.     The Department has pointed out that it cannot consent to the Order being literally enforced in suoh a way as to require farmers, who wish to purchase small quantities Qt potash for fertilising purposes, to obtain a licence.     The Ministry has consented, to limit the licences to dealers and merchants, wno will be required to obtain from the purchaser an undertaking that the material is required exclusively for fertilising purposes. &apos;   In the same way It has been
arranged that a general licence shall be issued by the Potash Production Department, authorising Agents approved by this Department, to purchase and sell Blast Furnace Dust.:- The terms and conditions of sale of this Flue Dust are to be sub-mi tted to the Potash Committee this week, and it is hoped that they will be published very shortly, together with a Leaflet advising farmers as to methods of application, etcc Seed Wheat -   Arrangements have been made, subject to the approval of the Treasury, for the supply of 30,COO to 40,000 quintals of seed wheat of the selected varieties of the 1917 crop to the French Government,,     It is proposed to make arrange-ments for shipping this wheat as expeditiously as possible.A reserve of about 6-,000 quarters will be retained by the Department in order to meet demands which may be made by farmers after the 10th November^ which is the last date appointed for receiving orders... -Seeds (other than Cereals). , -The formal assent of the Board of Agriculture for Scotland and the Department of Agriculture and Technical Instruction for Ireland having beexi received to the draft Testing of Seeds Order, 1917, the Order will be submitted forthwith to the Ministry of Food for issue.   -Seed Potatoes - Representatives of the three Departments of Agriculture have met. to consider the amended draft of the Seed Potatoes (1917 Crop) Order,. 1917, as submitted by the Ministry of Food,   - The representatives have recommended certain amendment to the Order which have been communicated to the Ministry of Food with a request that they may be introduced before the Order is finally issued.     The chief of these amendments is one by which the basis used for calculating the price of seed
potatoes t?ill be not the maximum price of ware under the Potatoes Order of 1917 but the guaranteed price of  6 per ton.I am,Sir,Your obedient Servant,Director-General.The Rt. Hon.. Rowland E, Prothero, M.P.President of the Board of Agricultureand Fisheries.
