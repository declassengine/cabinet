Moreover, much is. to be learnt-from a collation of the particulars of accidents and this is work y/hich requires a permament:staff.. In these circumstances it has been decided to dissolve the Accidsnts Investigation Committee and to set up a small Department under the Air Board for the purpose, of carrying on this work.- .2, The deliveries of engines and aircraft have beenas follows:-Engines Aeroplanes SeaplanesTotal for the week ending3rd November Total for October, 1917*-Total for October, 1916,491* 1894 562316** 137163326 100*Includinr $0 from I-Tance and 25 from the &quot; United States.**Including 3. from France.fciirned).
