In informed Cadorna as instructed and he was much disappointed that the preliminary concentration should be so far back, as he wished it to take place between Cittadella and castelfranco, which seems obviously too much advanced under present conditions. He said he was afraid British and French troops could not possibly arrive in time to enable him to hold line of the Piave which he was afraid he could not hold without allied help. I have seen General Gathorne Hardy to-night and he thinks if you think Mantus not too far forward for a preliminary concentration that the Corps Commanders would agree.
