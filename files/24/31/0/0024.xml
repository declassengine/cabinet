From:- General Delme Radcliffe, Italy. To   :- C.I.G.S., War Office.Handed in 6th Nov.1917 4.0 a.m. Received   6th Nov.1917 1.25 p.m.585. November 5th.Position November 5th.3rd Army.    Retirement is proceeding practically unmolested by the enemy.     Line of the Tagliamento is now held by small cavalry detachments with machine guns.2nd Army   is holding line of Tagliamento up to Spilimbergo with cavalry, in the same manner as the 3rd Army. The enemy on the left flank has pushed back General Giorgio*s detachment as far as Travesio,   There is some anxiety concerning safety of 63rd ana 36th divisions which were to have retired by road through Travesio, but as enemy&apos;s force at this point is not considerable, it is hoped they will complete retirement by roads further wostw     Withdrawal of the remnants of the 2nd Army is proceeding rapidly and with regularity.Aircraft reconnaissances indicate enemy concentra-tion opposite front of 3rd army and attempts to restore bridpe at Latisana and Coroipo, which have been frustrated.   Aircraft reconnaissance in Trentino as far as Botzen failed to discover any trace of exceptional movements of troops.Number of efficient battalions of Italian army now estimated as follows3rd Army 100, (some reduced in strength owing to recent fighting), 2nd army 24, 12th Corps 31, 4th Army 96, 1st Army 118, 3rd army Corps 3,2, medium and heavy artillery of3rd army and 2nd army is 184 guns and howitzers of various calibres, at and around Treviso, and 54 guns at and around Monte Belluno.
A number of guns of the 3rd.Army, which had been brought back as far as Coroipo, were lost owing to premature blowing up of the bridges.   Of the field artillery of 2nd and 3rd armies, about 500 guns have been saved.   There is enough ammunition for this artillery.    About 1,700 guns and 700 trench mortars have been lost.I visited H.Q. 1st Army to-day and General Pecori-Goraldi informed me that he has&quot; closely questioned the Commandere of all the divisions and many brigades, regiments and battalions, who have all assured him of their perfect confidence in thei * troops.   Special attention is being paid to the defensive organization of the floor of the valley, as in consequence of snev/ in the higher regions, enemy is more likely to attempt to force passage aleng- the valleys.   Pecori said that his defensive organization required 184 battalions to be complete and at presont he has only 118, but the French troops are being moved up to support defences of the Givdicaria and Lagarina Valley.Appearance and moral of the troops shows signs of improvement and the Italian staff seems more eonfident. Condition of horses and mules of the troops and transport is very bad indeed, and the animals would certainly fail if much more effort were required of them.    They were on very reduced grain rations before the retirement and have practically starved since it began.   Large number   of tractors has been lost and also many motor lorries, chiefly owing to premature blowing up of the bridges at Coroipo.   Shortage in means of transport is being acutely felt, though many new lorries have beon already supplied from Turin.    Weather still very fine, but there are signs of change.     If rivers rise the enemy&apos;s movements will be considerably delayed.
