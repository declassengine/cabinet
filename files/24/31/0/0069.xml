Lfegrams-&quot;SHIPMINDER, VIC, LONDONAny further communication on 0*8* 3 subject should be addressed to-      \^The Secretary,Ministry of Shipping,St. James&apos;s Park,London, S.W. 1, and the following number quoted.^323NISTRY OF SHIPPING,10th November, 1917.Sir,(This Document is the Property of His Britannic ^;*j^*ty&apos;s G^^*rrin&quot;*entIn continuation of my letter of the 5th instant, I am directed by the Shipping Controller to report, for the information of the War Cabinet, as follows:-CONVOYS.(a)   ijomeward bound Convoys.    Since the date of the last report 8 Convoys, consisting of 138 ships (985,000 tons deadweight) have arrived.    There were no casualties either by enemy action or by marine peril, but the s.s. &quot;CAPE FINISEBBE&quot;, out of H.M.S. &quot;ALBANY&quot; convoy, was sunk while on passage from Falmouth to Brest, and the s.s. &quot;ATMttTIAN&quot; from H.M.S. &quot;PAFUGA&quot; convoyJ after1 the dispersal of the convoy, was torpedoed off the Isle of Man and lost her rudder, but eventually arrived under her own steam at Liverpool.     In H.M.S. &quot;MANTUA1s&quot; convoy, the s.Si &quot;KANGAROO&quot; with 6,000 tons of wheat from Australia, broke down and was successfully towed in, first by s.s. &quot;POLITICIAN&quot; and tiien by H.M.S. &quot;MANTUA&quot;.    Had the &quot;KANGAROO&quot; not been in convoy, it is reasonable to suppose that she would have been sunk.    There are now 14 convoys on passage home, consisting of 180 ships.(b)   Outward bound Convoys.     Since the last report 10 convoys, consisting of 154 ships (1,760,000 tons deadweight) have been escorted through the danger zone.    There were no casualties either by enemy action or by marine peril, but the s.s. &quot;MARCONI&quot;, out from Devonport, collided after dispersaljSECSSTASI, ^AE CABINETwith
with a homeward bound convoy steamer, and returned toport.    There are now in the danger zone 7 convoys,consisting of 81 ships.    A statement is attached,       convoyed(A) showing the number of convoys, steamers and tonnage/to the 3rd November, 1917.     A statement is also enclosed(B) showing the percentage of casualties suffered by ships while they were actually in convoy, i.e, before the respective convoys are dispersed near the shores of this country.FINANCE.During the week ended the 3rd instant, the payments for compensation in cases of total loss of ships requisitioned, amounted to  1,223,400* making a total of  28,961,218 paid on this account since the 1st April, 1917.The unfortunate developments on the Italian front have necessitated the use of the Cherbourg/Taranto route being temporarily abandoned for Troops and Horses from ling land, and it is at present not known ?;hen it will be possible to reopen this route.    Arrangements have been made to utilise Marseilles for the Eastward movement of troops, and several vessels are expected to sail from Marseilles with troops in the course of the next few days.mm mm mmAs it became necessary to bring over several battalions of troops from Ireland, vessels were immediately provided for this purpose.    Owing to the Irish Sea being closed to traffic through the operations of an enemy submarine the movement of these troops and of troops fromthis
this side to Ireland to replace those brought over here, was delayed, but it has been possible now to carry out the transfer and it is expected to have the entire operation completed in a few days,NORWEGIAN ST3mm REQUISITION.The following Norwegian steamers have been requisitioned, namely &quot;BAUTA&quot;; &quot;HSSTR3LLA&quot; and &quot;BAUNE&quot;.- The s.s. &quot;WAR FL07&apos;/Sen built at Middlesbrough was delivered on the 1st instant.UNITED STATES SHIPPING:BOARD.On the 8th instant the Controller and the Shipping Control Committee received Mr. Day and Mr. Colby, of the United States Shipping Board, who were accompanied by Mr. Gunther, Secretary of the American Embassy. Tonnage questions affecting the United States and this country were discussed at some length and further conferences were arranged to take place in the immediate future.I am, Sir,Your obedient Servant,(cgd.) John Anderson.
