In any variation of the Order in this respect the following points be borne In mind:-(a) The Government pledge must be fulfilled.(b) The price of potatoes to the consumer must be kept ata sufficiently low figure to encourage a large consumption of potatoes with a view to effecting - economies in other1 food stuffs, especially cereals,(c) The distribution of the surplus crop must be arrangedfor evenly in ordor that too great a strain may not bo thrown on transport facilities at. any particular time.(&amp;)     The whole of the 1917 drop must be brought into consumption.(e-^     The cost to the taxpayer must be kept as low as possible.&apos;. The earliest date by which any fresh scheme for giving effectto the Government Guarantee of  6 to tho grower for every ton of sound marketable ware potatoes could come into operation is .  November 15th.     The quantity of potatoes to be covered by the guarantee between this date and the end of the season may be estimated as follovfs:-Acreage under potatoes inUnited Kingdom during 1917 1.350.000 acresEstimated total yield from thisacreage at 6.8. tons to the acre        9,180^.000 tons.LESS        Allowance for seed 1,500,000 tonsUndersized &amp; DamagedPotatoes, 750,000     &quot;Feeding of Livestock 250,000     &quot;Quantity alreadyconsumed 1^500,,000    114*000,00^&quot;     &quot;        4,000*000       &quot;Balanoe o,j*H,,udB      HrAllowing for wastage in piisduring season at \Q%  IBpOOO       nConsumable balance4*862oCC0      &quot;*w*Kt*a:- tat, MTMstm
/ 3. At the Cabinet Keeling on October 25th three methods,of dealing with the situation were discussed, and I was requested to submit further particulars of each scheme,   These are set out. below and described as schemes &quot;A&quot;, HBM and &quot;C0.Seheme ,!DM which has not yet been placed before the Cabinet has been prepared since that date, SCHEME &quot;A&quot;To reduce the retail price of potatoes to fdg per lb-fry means of an Exchequer subsidy.Retailers can sell potatoes at fd, per lb. at the 8lender margin of profit allowed by the Potatoes Order if they are enabled to buy them In their local market at about 4/6d. per cwt or  4-10-0 per ton.Potatoes normally pass through the hands of two viholesale dealers (a country dealer who buys from the farmer and a tov/n dealer who distributes to retailers) between the grower and the retailer.     The cost of this may bo estimated on the average at &amp;1-1&amp;-0 made up as followsRailway freight charges 10s,   0d. per tortUse of bags 5*     0.Porterage and cartage ... &amp;*     0,Two dealers and profits 12*     6-,Market charges &apos;. 2r     6.ii nn tin nh n 1,15, 0.it     ti 1-15-0 deducted from  4-10-0 the retailers buying price, leaves  2-15-0 for the grower*s selling price free on rail, and entails an Exchequer subsidy of  3-6-0 per ton, or  15,,,251,500, This Is a gross figure and there would be some saving on the bread subsidy as a set-off, but it is impossible to calculate to what extent the reduction in the retail price of potatoes would lesson the consumption of breadsThe/
The cost of this scheme to the taxpayer would he unnecessarily high,   There is no demand in England that the retail price of potatoes should be reduced below Id. per lb., although this is demanded in Ireland and in parts of Scotland. If prices were left to themselves in a free market, it is believed that the English grower would get about  5 to  6 per ton according to quality, the Scottish grower about  4-10-0 to  5-10-0 and the Irish grower about  4 to  5,   These prices would rise in the later months of the season.   The most that the Government have been aske* to do so far is to leave the market free while keeping their promise to the grower. SCHEME &quot;B&quot;To maintain the minimum price of  6 and steady the market by Government p-j.roha.ses at this figure for forward delivery.The advantage of this scheme is that it involves no alteration of the Potatoes Order and no change of policy. The disadvantages are as follows:-(a) The Irish difficulties will remain unsolved, i.e. potatoes will not be brought within the reach of the Irish poor and cannot be exported to England on terms which will enable them to compete with the English and &apos;*&apos;elsh markets.(b) The Government will probably have to buy more potatoes than they can deal with by preservation or use in the manufacture of bread, or industrial alcohol, etc., and there will be a serious danger of waste,(c) The maintenance of the minimum price cannot be enforced in view of the impossibility of prosecuting Irish or other farmers for selling below it.SCHEME &quot;C&quot;Abolition of minimum price and payment of compensation on an acreage basis be 5c0wer3,This would be the easiest and most effective way ofredeeming/
redeeming the guarantee if the growers would aeeept it. It would not in any sense be a compliance with the guarantee however3 and the general opinion of those who have been consulted is that the growers would consider it a breach of faith.   The priniciple was acscepted, it is true* in the Corn Production Act; but the yield of potatoes per acre is far more variable than the yield of corn.   In view of the strong objections raised this scheme is no longer pressed,,.4! .
Abolition of the minimum price and payment to the p;rower of the .... difference between what he receives and  6 per ton.rAll references in the Potatoes. Order 1917 to a inlnmum price for sales by growers will be deleted.   In substitution for the minimum price of  6 per ton f..o.r. the Government ;.hile allowing sales to take place at any figure below the prescribed maximum, will undertake to compensate growers on the following lines:-(a)   Every grower will furnish his Local Food Control Committee * monthly, wij^h full particulars of every consignment of four tons or more which he has delivered to the purchaser during the month/ showing the quantity delivered on each occasion, the price received, ^-r the date of delivery and the name of the purchaser.     This evidence must be supported in each case by a receipt given by the purchaser, and satisfactory third-party evidence of delivery having been effected..(b) The Food Controller in consultation with the Boards of Agriculture will fix, at the beginning of each month, a ruling price or base price for sales by growers within a particular area, and any sales below this figure will in the assessment of the subsidy payable to the grower be treated as having been made at the base price. Subject thereto the subsidy payable to each grower will be calculated^ by the Food Control Committees by taking the average price per tonat vjhich the grower has sold during the month, deducting this figure from  6 and multplying the result by the tonnage sold in lots of four tons.or more,(c) This scheme will come into operation on December lstbThe base price will be fixed for England and Tales for December at  5, for Scotland at  4-10-0, and for Ireland at  4.   The Food Controller will revise the base price in each country in each subsequent month, and may fix different base prices for particular districts in the same country, if he finds it advisable to do so,
(d) The Food Controller yrlll from time to time make large purchases of potatoes for any one or more of the follov/ing purposes.&apos;-1.     Distribution to bakers in furtherance of thescheme for encouraging the use of potatoes in bread.2.     For use in Drying Stations for the manufacture of dried potatoes,3,     B&apos;or other manufacturing purposes such as theproduction of Industrial alcohol, starch or glucose.4.     In order to reserve adequate stocks of the better keeping varieties for use in the later months ofthe season,,(e) The cost of this scheme to the Exchequer :rill not exceed  ,5,000,000 and will almost certainly be less because prices will rise in the later months of the season.
