.1   rCpjvof letter from the Shipping Controller, to the, Sec.re_t.gry_. gcrBnef.(Circulated with reference to war Cabinet  60, Llnute 4).Linistry of Shipping, St. Jemes&apos;s Pork, London, S.\7.2nd November, 1917.Dear Colonel Konkey,I em in receipt of your letter cf the 30th October recording the French proposal to employ&quot; Chinese Pioneer Battalions the Viestern front.&quot;&apos; So far as tonne/-re is concerned, this questionrr.1is closely &quot;bound up Tilth the question of employing Japanese troops to which you referred in your letter (lTo.l8AT/ll) of the 16th Octcber (War Cabinet Paper G.T.-2310).I. I enclose a homorandum on this latter question, which has been prepared from such information as was available without consulting the Japanese, - which it was clearly not desirable to do at the present&apos;stage.II.    As regards the Chinese Pioneer Battalions? these could not be carried in British ships except to the exclusion of Coolies. It does not seem that this is contemplated   and in any case, I do not think it would be desirable.   Chinese tonnage can be excluded from the calculation, as such tonnage is practically all river tonnage and unsuitable for long voyages.   There are 13 enemy ships interned in Chinese ports, one &quot;or two of which mi gat be suitable for the Chinese Pioneer Battalions, but we have no information as to their state of repair.   This brings us to the Japanese tonnage: butin so far as this is&quot; employed   it will reduce the amount availaole ior the carriage of Japanese troops,   So far as the Ministry of Shipping is concerned,&quot;however, there would be no objection&quot; to the use of Japanese tonnage, new tonnage building in Japan for French account, or the enemy ships interned in China.To carry 40,000 Chinese is not a very serious undertaking ii spread over severs! months.   Probably even a small ship would cOTy 1,500 to 2,000 with some cargo below.   Twenty to thirtv ships would be required if the 40,000 wore all to be brought at once. This however, does not appear to be contemplated.(ach ship could do&apos;one trip every three months if she&quot; aid not proceed beyond aSSgypt, or one trip in four months if .she wont througli tno r^fd,   as the Chinese are apparently intended for Prance,&quot; it would Pe better, I think, to send the ships- to Marseilles instead of ^-snipping in Jigypt for Tarento.t.
The question ^nether- the recruiting of the Pioneer Battalions would interfere with the recruiting of the Chinese Labour Corps is as surges ted in General Panouse^ letter, a matter for settlement between the English and French recruiting representatives in China but is it quite correct to say that the coolies recruited by the British Government come exclusively from the Southern Provinces ? Our recruiting is, I understand, entirely in Shantung (which is not a Southern Province) and in tha North.Yours truly,(Signed). J.P.MCLAY.
