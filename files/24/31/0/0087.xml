King report dated the 6th aovember ha a been reoeiveo. from the British Military Intelligence Sectionin Italyfrom all sides comes evidence of the great increase of enemy propaganda in Italy during the last month.     Indeed, enemy intrigue seems to have been the principal cause of the military 1 debacle1.     This does not mean that the arrival of German Divisions and the first experience of German military efficiency had not a very \ : eat effect upon the Italian Army, lae Italians, who have for the last generation looked to Germany for financial and commercial direction, have always had an almost supernatural fear of the German Army.     Gaaorna&apos;8 confidence on the first day of the offensive, when the arrival of Serraan Divisions was already an established fact, shows, how-ever, that the Italian dig her Command considered themselves capable of meeting oven a German offensive.     Bo confident In fact was Cadorna that he instructed Giardino, the Minister of war, to read a statement in the Chamber, stating categorically that the Italian Army could.deal with tho offensive.     Cudorna, looking at his positions and the numbers and material of his army had no doubt Justification for his optimism.     What he and ninety-nine people&apos; out of a hundred in Italy failed to realize was that the morale of the front had been undermined by an insidious propaganda.     For this both civil and military authori-ti.es are to blame.     whilst the military authorities seem to nave been ignorant of what .1ms been going on in the trenches, the Government have never during the war taken any effective action in tne country against enemy propaganda, nor have they ever tried !o explain to the people of Italy why Italy is fighting at all.After the &apos;debacle-&apos; everybody is wise, and on all sides one hears stories of enemy propaganda and attacks upon the nqgligence of the Government.The following incidents, small in themselves, are significant of the effect of the political and sooi^d intrigues that have re-o ent ly be en r anp&amp;nt: -The British batteries., have had a canteen at Gradisca.     &apos;.hen tne canteen was broken up, the Italian cook said to one of the ladies who had been managing it, &quot;now that you English have gone, tne war will end at on:, e.&quot;Monaon, our Commissioner of hod. dross, was walking on the ;Jar so and said ?good morning&apos; to some men wit cm he passed.     Theyoplied by cursing him as one of the hat^d English who were keeping Italy In the war.A man from one of the !Xurin regiments was sent home on leave te help with the harvest.     &quot;hen he arrived he refused to do any work and said that the w ole of his regiment had taken an oath to do no work that was likely to prolong the war.Upon this responsive material there rained taing the early days $f the offensive a storm of leaflets from Austrian aeroplanes some of them took the Pupal Kote as their text, others the speech of the Italian Socialist Travis, in which he had declared that &quot;Mo one was to remain in the trenches during the&apos; winter.&quot;The combination of those influences, a Gexman surprise attack mfi the scarcity of roads seems to have created a confusion, such as, in the words of a man who has seen five big retreats &quot;has seldom happened.before.&quot;     Bridges that should have been blown up

Ho motor   rectors y,ere pro-vided for him, end when at last he obtained horses,the Italian drivers cut the traces and rode off on them.     Only by dragging them by hand could the guns be saved.As to what Is now happening on the T&amp;gliamento,! have no details necessary to form a judgment,nor indeed would it be v-ithin Biy province to do so.    It seessa however evident from what Colonel Karchetti has told m that the position is anything but s&amp;bis-factory.    From another reliable source I hear that the troops iihleh should have resisted the passage of the Austrians at Hlnsano refused to fight*Behind the line the two principle dangers seem to me to be firstly,the huge number of deserters and secondly,the increasing flood of refugees.As to the deserters,I hoar that there are Jekx2OO,000 at large. According to Colonel Harehetti they are being rounded up as thoroughly as posicle,and General Gadorna has issued a proelama-tion ordering them under pain of death to return within five day a When,however,their number is taken Into account,and the fact that a man in uniform can board any train and travel to any part of Italy without a ticket,the seriousness of the problem will be realised.    At best these men oay after immense trouble be again collected into seise kind of military organisation,at worst they can spread discontent through the length and breadth of the country.&quot;As to the refugees,! understand that Risoletl v-ill be the Minister In charge of questions connected with them.     He is certainly an active and sympathetic man,but personally I am doubtful as to whether there is any organ!setion in Italy that can deal with a sudden Influx of ssen,women,and children,who in number will probably amount to two mil lions, at a time when food is scarce and esoans of communication are at: ained to breaking-    * point.     &amp; mn whom I saw yesterday tells me that cf the large numbers who have already arrived in Florence,-any individuals have considerable sums of money with them.     The possession of money in face of a shortage of food Is having the seme effect that it had in Petrogred last &amp;arch,by increasing the resentment of the people,Who possessing the medium of exchange In abundance could obtain notding for it.There is&apos; another though lesser danger to which a reference should be wdei-i.8. the number of German agents who are scattered through tho country In Italian uniform.     Colonel Marchettl tells rae that during the last few days a number of these agents have been arrested,and that one in particular,discovered in Florence, is being brought to Home for examination.As to politics,It appears that the crisis has for the momett had the effect of uniting public men and parties.     The best opinion seems to be.that Orlando is the only minister who could who could hold together the various political elements.     Orlando1 s administration during the summer v/as no doubt culpabably weak. Indeed he himself owned m in the Chamber that he had been gam-bling upon the war coming to an   nd before the winter,and that on the strength of this early terminalion,he had been purposely governing with a very lig t hand.   It is probable that&apos;he will new fi d the principle opposition not in the Socialists,who,whilst trey refuse to abandon their official, policy,are individually and
RL-401No.VII.3.officially adopting a patriotic attitude,or in the Vatican that 3s holding its hand for a suitable moment in which to renew its peace propaganda,but in the extreme Interventionists,wh:se strength lies particularly in Milan.     These men are furious with him for his past record of weakness,his inclusian of a notorious Giolittian in the Ministry and his telegram to Giolitti.     As tp his telegram to Giolitti,most people seem agreed that it had no sinister motive and that it was necessary for him to enlist Giolitti?s support at a moment of extreme crisis, Giolitti is expected to reappear in the Chamber next reek.     Those vho know him host^however, seem to think that he will merely make a patriotic speech and then retire again Into private life.. His natural timidity will in this event x-^ovent his seising the opportunity of a lifetime,for at the moment he has the ball at his feet.     He could repeat and repeat with far greater effect his success In the Libyan War,when after opposing its declaration he appeared as a patriot ready to carry it &quot;through, to a suo-cetfsful conclusion,and by this means obtained the control of it. In the same way he could no?/ declare that whilst he had opposed a war of aggrosion,as an Italian patriot lie was heart and soul for a war of defence *A reassuring symptom In the interior of the country is the fact that up to th   pz-esent there have been no troubles in the cities.     Even Turin,the centre of Giolittifs power, seems tc have changed its attitude towards the war.     :jur Consul told me that in his opinion Turin and Piedmont,hjtherto notably half-hearted about the war,would non resist the invader with a force greater than that of any other part of Italy.Mono the less,the situation is altogether artificial. The papers are so heavily censored that no one hvs any idea of what is happening.     No minister has made any public statement nor apparently is any effort being attempted to inform and confirm public opinion.So fearful in fact are the Government of the real state of affairs being known that they have I believe actually requested the Ambassador to use his influence to stop the publication of details of the disaster in the British Fress.
