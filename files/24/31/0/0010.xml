99Subject to appeal to the War Cabinet and those provisos(a) That the proceedings should be notified to tho War Cabinet:(b) That all decisions of tho Committoo(2)   The Committee wero informed by the Minister cf Muni-tions that ho had assembled a Departmental Committee in ordor to propose a scheme for the transfer of 1,300 skilled men to aircraft production, and that arrangements were being mado, in concert with the Labour Supply Department, for the transfer to start at onco*   The Departmental Commit-too had, however, stated their opinion that the supply of Labour for future aircraft demands could only be aaoqua,tely met by withdrawing skillod labour a.t present employed by other Departments on loss ossontial work.(3)   The Committee unanimously approved a proposal that a. smaJl body consisting of three or four men of experience, fully conversant with the subject and. not necessarily nominees of tne Departments concerned, should bo appointed to .go into labour dilution as&apos; a whole so far as the production of munitions of war is involved and to advise the throo Departments as to what further dilution was possible.* . .....The First Lord, the Secretary- of State for War, and the Minister of Munitions, under-took ta submit the names of suitable men before the next Meeting of the Committeoo Subsequent t.3 the Meeting., the Secretary of Stato for War, intimated to tho Chairman that ho thought that the said body should include a nominoo^&apos;of the Minister of National Sorvico, the said official being hold to be jointly nominated by Lord Derby and Sir Auckland freddos.(4)   The Committee agreed that it was unreasonable to ask tho War Cabinet to furnish them with a complete and inflexible war plan for the future.   They felt, howover, that, if they wero usefully to fulfil their functions   it was necessary to know whother a supremo effort to bring the War to an end was to bo made in 1913, or whether provision should be made for a prolongation of tho War into 1919 and after,   In the former event it would bo possible to draw upon.the hugo reserves which wero being piled up of shells, etc, and of which tho expenditure during tho winter would be comparatively limited, in ordor to divert labour and material to essential services, o.g. shipbuilding and aircraft.

101should he represented &quot;by a Member of their Council, viz., Sir A.
