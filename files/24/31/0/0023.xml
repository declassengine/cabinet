REPORT ON THE WORK CARRIED OUT BY THE BOMBING SQUADRONS NEAR .NANCY FROM THE 2ND. OCTOBER TO MIDDAY ON THE 29TH. OCTOBER.Orders were given for the bombing squadrons to proceed to the neighbourhood of Nancy on the 2nd. October, 1917.On the 3rd. October orders were issued for one squadron to leave for that neighbourhood, but owing to the bad weather all the machines did not arrive at the aerodrone until the 15th. October as they were delayed en route by storms and clouds.The second squadron left on the 11th., and although five of the machines found their way in rain and fog to the aero-drome on this date, the remainder were scattered about the line of route, and it was not until the 16th. that the squadron was complete at its destination.The Naval machines did not start until the 15th. October, and after staying a day at Paris they arrived at their destinatv ion on the 17th. October.      The first difficulty was to form. the Naval machines into a squadron, as all the machines, pilots and mechanics came from different stations and had never seen each other before they got to Ochey.        It took some days to do this, but a month ought always to be allowed In order to allow the squadron to get working efficiently.The first day or two pilots were learning the country in order to pick up land marks quickly, and at night they learnt the country right up to the line.The weather was bad until the 17th. October when the first raid over the lines was carried out on the Burbach fact-ories at Saarbrucken.       Six machines left the ground at 12.57 p.m. and a further six at 1.4 p.m.   At about 2 p.m. one of the machines experienced engine trouble, fired a light and returned.     This signal was misinterpreted by one of the pilots, who thought that the raid was abandoned and returned.      At
2.40 p.m. another pilot had engine trouble and returned tohis aerodrome.     The remaining nine machines reached theirobjeotive about 3 p.ra. and dropped 18 - 112-lb bombs with goodeffect.    Sight bombs were observed to burst in the middle oftho Burbaoh Works where several fires wor* started.    Th;, re-maining bembs fell in tho middle of Saarbrucken.        The xattached photographs were taken during she raid which clearly show the fires started in the works.        In spite of powerful anti-aircraft gun fire which v/as oncountered over the objective, all machines returned, landing on their aerodrome about 3.45 p.m.On the night 17th/l8th it was intended to carry out a night raid, but this had to be abandoned owing to difficulties about night landing arrangements with the French.     They use a fixed searchlight always taking off in the same direction irrespective of wind, which is impossible if flying is to be done in any appreciable wind.       This trouble was amicably settled the next day by dividing the aerodromo into two parts, one half fcr the French and om half for ours?lVv?s.The next three or four days low clouds, rain and mist only allowed short praotiee flights.to be done.On the 21st. October the weather cleared late in the forenoon, and at 1.50 p.m* twelve machines left the aerodrome to bomb the factory and railway communications West of Bous and Wadgasson.     At 2.25 p.m. ana of the machines landed at the aerodrome with engine trouble.        Six of the machines arrived over the dbjeotive at 3.50 p.m. and a further five at 3.55 p.m.     22 - 112-lb. bombs were dropped v/ith excellent results.     Three bursts were observed on Bous Railway Station and one amongst houses in Wadgassen which oaused a large explosion. Ten German scouts attacked the formation
over the objective after the bombs had been dropped and a fight ensued.    Pour of the hostile machines were driven down completely out of control by Captain Gray, 2nd, Lieut * Rose, Sergt, 0?Lieff and A/Corpl. Walters,      On the way back one of   our machines was seen flying low down under con-trel as near the line as five miles.   This machine, which did not return, was evidently being forced to land close to tho German front line with engine trouble.    The other ten machines landed at their aerodrome about 4,40 p,m.From the 21st till the 24th thick low clouds and ra.in again prevented other than practice flights being attempted.Late in the afternoon of the 24th the weather cleared turning into a bright starlight night.    At 5,50 p,m, nine Hundley Page machines left the ground to bomb the Burcach Works at Saarbrucken and at 6,25 p*m, 16 machines of another squadran left on a shorter raid owing to their smaller petrol capacity, with trains, junctions, stations and the railway line between Falkemburg and Saarbrucken as their objectives,    84 - 112-lb, bombs were dropped by the Hundley Pages on the Burbach Y/orks, all of which were observed to burst on the objective, starting many fires.    The machines of the other squadron dropped a total of 13 - 230-lb, and 25 - 25-*lb, bombs. Two of the pilots reached Saarbrucken and dropped their bombs on the furnaces and on the station where large explosions &quot;were seen,    8 - 230-lb, and 15    25-lb, bombs were dropped on Marlenbach Junction (between St, Avoid and Saarbrucken,), Falkemburg Station and Stc Avoid Station where good results were obtained.   Two 230-lb, bombs and four 25-lb, bombs were dropped en trains.   One of the heavy bombs obtained a direct hit. Anti-aircraft guns were located at all the
objectives and were particularly active over Saarbrucken. A balloon barrage was observed at the Burbaoh Works at a height ranging between 6,000 and 7.000 feet.. Unfortunately at about 9 p.nu, when the machines were on their way back, the weather suddenly changed, thick clouds, rain and mist blowing up.     Machines cf both squadrons had great difficulty in finding their aerodromes.   One of the Handley Pages landed on a wood at about 90 miles an hour, completely wrecking the machine, the personnel escaping uninjured. Two of these machines failed to return.      Of the machines of the other squadron two failed to return and one other had a forced landing outside the aerodrome.   The machine was undamaged and was flown back on the 25th.Prom the 25th, to 12 noon 29th, the weather has been unsuitable for raids cither by day or by night.   There have been occasionally short Intervals of moderately fine weather during which tests and practice flights have been carried out.(Sd.)   H. TKENCHARD.Major-General, R. P. G.30th October, 1917
G* S.Adv. G.H.Q.In continuation of my C.R.F.C 1721/9/34G of the 30th. ult. in reply to your 0.B./128/368 of the 27th. ult.,I enclose herewith report as requested by the Officer Commanding the Bombing Group up to the night 30th/31st. October.As far as can be foreseen at present the difficulties due to atmospheric conditions will increase very largely during the winter months owing to the weather in this neighbourhood being most treacherous, as although it may be perfectly fine at one spot, 30 miles away it may be raining and snowing hard. Local fogs are also very bad.        This is borne out by the weather report for this country last winter.With regard to the enemy&apos;s defences, these consist chiefly of anti-aircraft guns, which, though not in great numbers, are fairly numerous and are reported .as being very accurate. Each place which has been bombed has anti-aircraft guns, and these I think will undoubtedly increase.The enemy!s protective aircraft are very few, and those existing now, although not of the latest type, are of the fast scout type.        These, also, In my opinion, will increase as our attacks get more numerous.At night, searchlights are numerous and alert.The losses so far experienced in this neighbourhood are !-Hayal Squadron* Handley Page machines.Three machines missing - probably due to weather.One machine completed crashed in a wood owing to mist and rain.One other out of action owing to damage sustained in a collision, but which can be repaired.C.R.F.C. 1721/9/57/G. SECRET.
R.F.C.Day Bombing Squadron.One De Havilland Four machine missing - probably forced to land in the German lines either due to engine being hit by A.A. fire or machine gun fire, or to engine failure.One machine wrecked on landing after going up to look for Zeppelins.One machine wrecked - due to weather.Beth the R.F.C.Squadrons are up to strength with machines in reserve.     The Naval Squadron (Handley Pages) consists only of six machines.     One more machine is being sent down as soon as the weather permits.(Sd).   H. Trenchard.Major General. Commanding Royal Flying Corps, Adv. H.Q., R.F.C., ^   in the Field.1st November, 1917.R.F.G.Night Bombing Squadron.Two F.E.2b machines missing - probably due to weather. One machine wrecked - due to weather.

I. MOVE TO PCHEY.All machines moved by air under most difficult atmospheric conditions.   The weather was continuously bad ?/ith low clouds, high v/inds and rain.The first Squadron to start from the North took eleven days to reach its destination, progress being only possible by moving from Aerodrome to Aerodrome during the very few reasonably clear intervals.II. PRELIMINARY WORK.As machines reached Ochey every opportunity was taken to allow pilots and observers to learn the country, but weather conditions remained mostly unfavourable, even for Aerodrome flying.III. SITUATION OF MACHINES ON 15TH OCTOBER.At Ochey - 18 F.E.2b&apos;s. -   No.100 Squadron.15 De Havilland 4s. - No.55 Squadron. (The remainder being still en route).10 Handley Pages were available from 21st October.IV.     LOCAL CONDITIONS.(A) Weather.   The weather has been almost continuously bad,   A great deal of rain has fallen and also a certain amount of snow.   Several consecutive days of thick fog have been experienced.Generally speaking the climatic conditions are most treacherous.   Squalls with heavy rain and cloud frequently arrive with little warning.During the sixteen days under consideration bombing operations have only been possible on three occasions by day, and three by night.S E C R E T.REPORT   ON    OPERATIONS CARRIED OUT BY 41ST WING, R.

?.. 142(B) Features of the Country.   Generally speaking the type of Country now being flown over is quite new to pilots and observers.     By day landmarks are on the whole good, but by night difficulty is experienced in comparison with Northern France and Belgium.The Line is very difficult to see by day, and almost entirely invisible by night.ENEMY DEFENCES.(A) A - A guns are numerous in the neighbourhood of all targets, and the shooting is accurate.(B) E.A.   Only one formation has been encountered consisting of ten machines of the Albatross D.1 type.(C) Searchlights.   Numerous and active.(D) Balloon Barrages.   Have been observed round Metz and Saarbrucken, both at about 5 -* 6,000 feet.,OPERATIONS CARRIED OUT. By DayXai&quot;       17th October,2 Raids were carried out by machines of No.55 Squadron on the Burback Works, just West of Saarbrucken. A total of 1,792 lbs. of bombs were dropped on the objective with excellent results.    Eight bombs of 112 lbs. each were seen to burst on the objective, and large fires resulted, A number of photographs were taken some of which showed the fires due to bombing.    Weather conditions were misty but fairly good.. ;(b) 21st October,2 Raids were carried out by No.55Squadron on the Factories and the Railways immediately West of Bous and Wadgassen in the Saar Valley.   A total of 2,464 lbs. of bombs were dropped on the objective with very good results, several explosions being observed on the Railways and amongst the buildings of the FactorieseHeavy fighting took place over the objective with 10 hostile machines as a result of which four E.A. were driven down out of control,   The enemy made no attempt to follow our machines.
toaohines en the return journey.    Numerous photographs were taken hut owing to thick mist and clouds the results were not successful.    Weather conditions mcdcrate thick clouds and mist.     One cf cur machines failed to return, (c).        30th October        2 Raids wars oarri-ad out &quot;by No. 55 Squadron against tho Tanning Industries in and around the Town of Pirmasens.     2,712 lbs. of explosives were dropped on the objeotives and good results were observed.    Photographs taken show several bombs&quot; bursting on the Railway Station and on ane of th j Paotorios.&quot;   All observers roport that consider-able damago was done and many bursts and the resulting oolumns of smoke woro seon.    Weather conditions good.    All naohinos returned safely. By Night.(a)        24th October       9 Handley Pages of &quot;A&quot; Naval Squadron attaoked the Burbaok Works west of Saarbruoken. 84 bombs of 112 lbs. each were dropped on the Faotory and the Buildings in the vicinity.    Numerous fires and explosions wore observed.    Weather conditions good at first but heavy clouds and rain tame up later, rendering the return journey most difficult.     2 machines failed to return., 14 P.B.2bls. of No, 100 Squadron attaoked the Railway Mne between Palkenberg and Saarbrucken.     3,651 lbs. of explosives were dropped on various Stations and Junctions with good results.One train received a 23C lb, bomb and was partially removed from the llne0T1,20C rounds fired at searchlights etc     Weather conditions good at first but becoming very bad,     2 machines failed to return.
(b) 29th October        9 F.E.2b&apos;s. of No.100 Squadron attempted to attack the Factories at Volklingen.6 machines returned with their bombs being unable to find the objective.    The remaining three machines dropped 915 lbs. of explosives on the line leading to Saarbrucken from S.S.V,&apos;,One good burst was observed near Saarbrucken Station and two others in close proximity to moving trains.400 rounds fired at searchlights.   Weather conditions very thick and hazy.     All machines returned.(c) 30th October 12 F.2.2bts. of No.100 Squadron attacked the Steel Works and the Station at Volklingen. 3,075 lbs. of explosives were dropped on the Steel Y/orks and Stations.
