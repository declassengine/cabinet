&apos;(This Document isJhe Property of ^His f ritannic fcuj&amp;giy^ Government.)       ;FOODSMBCORAITDUM 3Y FOOD CONTROLLERI desire to bring before the Jar Cabinet the necessity forintroducing, at the earliest practicable date, a. system ofcompulsory rationing and distribution of the principal foods.differentThe position is now entirely /fro :a that in Hay and June, when this question was formerly considered by the 7/ar Cabinet, and a different conclusion should be reached.    At that time there was an actual difficulty as to the distribution of one article alone (namely, sugar) and there was an apprehended difficulty as to the sufficiency of cereal supplies till the harvest, now the position&quot; is as follows :-(1) There are local famines of a number of articles -bacon, butter, cheese, sugar, tea - with a prospective shortage of meat.   Diminishing total supplies afford an inadequate margin to cover inequalities of distribution and consumption. There is an increasing number of complaints from many&apos; quarters .(2) The position in regard to cereals is satisfactory only so long-as it is looked at in isolation and without reference to other countries,    &quot;/hen account is taken on the one hand of the prospective needs of the Allies, and, on the other hand, of the strain that will be thrown on cereal supplies by the shortage of other foods here, there can be no ground for confidence.    The position is further affected by the necessity of artificially cheapening bread and the possibility that this policy must be extended to other articles.   At the present time, in spite of tne -abundance of potatoes and of all efforts to secure voluntary economy, the consumption of bread and flour in this country is certainly as high as it was last year and has shown a tendency to rise .;&apos;though not rapidly) since the introduction of the cheaper loaf.
!(3)   The memorandum of 30th October by the shipping con-troll er, forecasting a reduction in imports in 1918 amounting to eight million tons ss compared with 1917, compels a readjustment of policy in regard to rationing as in other directions.     v. have already largely lost certain extremely imoortant sources of surply on tne Continent (in particulars Denmark and -iolland for becon and butter).    &quot;7e are likely now to lose,&apos;to a Large extent, .sources of similar supplies in Australia and pew Zealand, and it is more than doubtful whether adequate increased amounts can be drawn from North America to replace these losses.    In any ease I cannot,  on the facts now before me, assent to any reduction at all in the present supplies of the staple foods, while distribution remains unregulated by compulsory rationing, and substantially tn.e whole of the reduction of eight millions tons of imports must, fall either on munitions or i on. other articles..    On the other hand, if a. system of ; compulsory end.-scientific distribu-tion,of foods.is introduced, a smaller supply of food should prove &apos;sufficient, since.it will not ue; necessary to provide so great a margin to cover inequalities of distribution, and consumption.It is clearly, impossible to. state exactly how great a reduction could be effected, but it would,,I think,  be substantial... Calculations are being made with a view to preparing, such an.estimate as is possible,.I am of opinion, accordingly, that &apos;the time has come for compulsory rationing of all the essential foods,.namely, bread and flour, meat (including bacon), sugar, and fats (batter, margarine, lard) and in an appendix have set out. the rough heads of a scheme for this purpose.Any,rationing scheme.should, in my opinion,:be framed,, so as to coyer at least the above-mentioned foodseven though - ,.... /       ,,  .. , , . ....... ,   , &apos; . /       ,&apos;.    .    for,. .&apos;
for administrative reasons it is not applied simultaneous^ to them rll.   A rrtioning system applied only to one food is unset is fr.c tory because it leaves the. wealthier classes free to divert their excess-ive consumption to unrationed articles.T-he scheme provides for distribution as as well as for retion-ing in the narrow sense.   It is to he regarded not merely as a means of restricting consumption to a certain maximum,, hut also as e means of securing, so far as possible, that, supplies- up to that maximum are available to all who need it,    /Iiile it Is impossible to give an absolute guarantee that for every ration ticket a corresponding ration shall he everywhere and at ell times available, it is necessary to aim at securing this as a general rule and in practice.   As is pointed out below, I attach the greatest importance to this Tooint as a means of securing popular acceptance of compulsory rationing.The objections that may be raised to the introduction of com-pulsory rationing are, in the main, three, namely, the cost of labour and administration, the fear of causing industrial unrest, and the fear of giving encouragement to the enemy.is to the first point, the administrative machinery will unquestionably be extensive and costly.   Ho rationing system is worth attempting unless it is strong enough and elaborate enough to stand the strain of an acute scarcity of rationed foods.   Unless, however, wc can obtain sufficient food to provide not only for our minimum needs but also for inequalities of distribution and consumption, we must take steps to organise the distribution and consumption.As to the second point, rationing appears unpopular only when it is looked at merely as a means of restricting consumption,    in my view, however, restriction of consumption is only one and oerheps not the most important purpose of the policy.   The principal object of rationing is to secure that in time of stringency the essential foods are distributed first and foremost to the essential workers, **-e. are distributed in the national interest and not according to
303   jthe purchasing power of the individual.   Rationing, in fact, is the only possible corrective to the power of the purse in a time of. scarcity.   A rationing system which provided adequately for the necessarily greater consumption of the manual workers and was explained as intended to do so, would I think be welcomed by a large majority of the population.As to the third point, if any economy in food consumption is to be secured, it must be secured either by the introduction of compulsory rationing or by a voluntary campaign in which it would be necessary to put the risk of famine prominently and emphatically before the public.    The latter course would give at least as much encouragement&apos;to the enemy as the former, while it would not give the same encouragement to our allies of making it appear that we were taking effective measures to deal with the food situation.In conclusion, I wish to emphasise the question of time.    The period of difficulty in regard to fuod supplies ,.vill be the second half of the cereal year, namely, from March to August next,   Till then a temporary deficiency of other foods can, generally speak-ing, be met by drawing upon stocks of cereals.    ./jny rationing systen therefore, should come into force not later than the beginning of March or April.    I am satisfied, however, that any comprehensive system such as that described above would involve a minimum of four months of preparation.    If, therefore, the system is to be introduced by the beginning of April, the final decision to do so must be taken at latest by the end of November.    It would, of course, be possible, if circumstances altered in the next few moniiio    to reverse a decision to introduce rationing/but this decision should definitely be reached in the present month and full authority should be given to incur any necessary expenditure, on the assumption that the system v/a.s to be introduced not later than the beginning of April, 1918.ovember 9th, -1917.
APPENDIX &quot;X^PROVISIONAL HEADS OF SCHEME FOR COMPULSORY RATIONING- AND DISTRIBUTION OF ESSENTIAL FOODSThe scheme will apply to bread and flour, meat (including bacon) sugar and fats (butter, margarine and lard).   It may apply also to all cereals and similar articles (beans,peas etc) cheese and other foods.The rations will be graduated according to occupation, age and sex, the population being divided into a number of classes (probably five) according to their needs.     The classification and amount of ration are subject to further consideration.     As an illustration, however, of the probable range of variation it may be stated that a Departmental Committee which considered ration scales last summer recommended a ration for the highest class (men on the heaviest industrial or agricultural work)amounting to 15 lbs. of bread and meat together in a week, while that for men of sedentary occupation was l\ lbs, and for children under 10 - 4&apos;J lbs.An individual ration paper will be issued for each person authorising that person to draw periodically from a Post Office the appropriate number of coupons f r each of the various rationed foods,     A coupon will be surrendered to the retailer whenever a purchase is made.     In the case of some foods at least it will probably be necessary to require the surrender of a ration coupon in restaurants and other places of public eat-inr*     Probably this will be the case in respect of bread and meat, but it might be avoided in the case of sugar and fats- The coupons will subsequently be sent by the retailer to the Losal Food Office by way of accounting for the disposal of/his
his stocks.     This ensures that the retailer insists upon receiving a coupon before selling,  and thus that future supplies can be distributed according to the actual number of rations required in each locality.Various duties in connection with the control of retailers and the local administration of the scheme will devolve upon the Food Control Committees,     It is, however, of the greatest importance that the Post Office should undertake the voluminous routine work of the issue of the appropriate ration coupons on presentation of the ration papers.     This arrangement is        c of course subject to the assent of the Postmaster-General who is being consulted on the.subject.Such a coupon system can be introduced via the present Sugar Distribution Scheme in the following manner.In addition to the process of registration of households, which has already been carried out, a process of individualregistration is about to be instituted in order to meet the needs of (a) persons who have refrained from registering on the house-hold system owing to their being likely to move from place to place in the course of their employment, and (b) persons who, though registered on the household system, have subsequently ceased to be members of the original registered households.     For persons registered individually, a ration paper is to be provided entitling them to obtain sugar coupons periodically from any Post Office.Further, in order to provide persons who, on the close of the individual registration process, are still members of registered households with a means of obtaining sugar upon their subsequent removal each such person will be provided with a Ticket for use upon removal.     V,hen a person bearing one of these Tickets removes, the Ticket may be taken to a Post Office.     The Post Office will, on/surrender
surrender of the Ticket, hand out sugar coupons for the next ensuring period, and transmit the Ticket to an Office at which a ration paper will be prepared and issued to the person in question for his subsequent use, in obtaining coupons.It will thus be seen that the present Sugar Registration Scheme already provides for a section of the population obtaining their sugar ration by means of a coupon system, and for a gradual transference to the coupon system of all other people&apos; who from time to time break off from registered households.     If it is decided by the Government to adopt the compulsory rationing of several food stuffs a convenient method, of placing the whole population on the necessary coupon system, wou2d be to reouire all persons by a given date, to exchange their Tickets for the personal document entitling them to coupons, without waiting for the removals which would otherwise set this machinery of exchange in motion in the case of the particular individual.Thus, without in any way interfering with the present SugarRegistration Scheme, the way could be prepared for placing thewhole population, at comparatively short notice, upon the couponsystem,  and enabling other food stuffs than sugar to be rationed on that system.If for any reason this process of accelerated transition toa full-&apos; coupon system by means of the Sugar Registration Scheme Is not adopted, it would be necessary to postpone the introduction of the Sugar Registration Scheme and to start anew to prepare a coupoi scheme to cone into operation not later than the end of March.The foregoing proposals are previsional only,      h detailed scheme is now being prepared-,
