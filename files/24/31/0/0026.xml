(This Document \$ the Property of*\ His Britannic Mgjgsty^ Government.)o   iDepartment ef Information.SSCRST.Intelligence Bureau. GEV//001?7BE LY - HSPOliT   Oil   HOLLAND.    I. (Ktv. 6th, 1917)Attitude of the Dutch and German Press to the Sand and Gravel Dispute.As might perhaps be expected the Dutch Press with the exception of the &quot;Telegraaf&quot; is solidly behind their Government.     In general the arguments advanced are merely amplifications of the Communique of the Netherlands Government.     There is, of course, considerable irrita-tion over the stoppage of the commercial cables facilities and in some quarters there is an attempt to show that that measure is part of a new policy of Great Britain and the United States for the intimidation and coercion of Holland.It is hardly necessary to say that the German Press has made great capital out of the Anglo-Dutch conflict.     Such newspapers as the &quot;Frankfurter Zeitung&quot; (Oct. 19 0 maintain that the Entente has comnletely thrown over &quot;International Lav?&apos;.     This can be seen in their highhanded action in stconing Dutch Commercial Telegrams and still more in their attempt   to impress Dutch Shipping for their service.     Such proceedings must show Holland the value of the Entente boast that they are fighting for the orotection of small nations.     The &quot;Weser&quot; (Oct. 17) says that the action of Great Britain and America assumes the oronortion of a political act against Dutch neutrality which is sacred to Germany.     It maintains that German and Dutoh interests are identical and goes into a long disquisition en Belgian annexationist aims as laid down in the &quot;Vingtieme Sieclo&quot;, a magazine which is said to be inspired by Ilr. de Broqueville, (3elgian **rime Minister).    It of course assumes that GrBat Britain is at the back of these alleged schemes and that Ilr. de Broqueville,
relying on England1a power, seriously contemplates the incorporation0f Belgium in the British Empire.     The ill-success of the campaignin Flanders has defeated British designs;   but a new method has beendevised, and that is to force Holland to fight for the Entente bybringing economic pressure to bear on her.In order to increase ill-feeling in Holland and Germany the&quot;Zolnische Zeitung&quot; (Oct. 27) states that according to the &quot;Standaard&quot;the organ of the well-known pro-German Dutch oolitician Dr. Kuyoer,there are already symptoms that such a plan is in contemplation.There is no fear of its success as the Netherlands would ho stronglybacked by Germany;   but the Dutch Indies would be at the mercy ofpaperJapan.   The Cologne/goes so far as to maintain that on two occasions the prompt action of Queen Wilhelmina has prevented en invasion of Holland by Great Britain, once early in the war when she refused to allow the garrison of Antwerp to escape by way of the Scheldt and again when at the Paris Conference a landing in Holland was discussed.Holland and America.The refusal of the U.S.\merioa of bunker coal to Dutch ships coming from the West Indies and S, America, together with the reported in-tention to requisition Dutch vessels in American harbours has created great indignation in Holland.     There are said to be about sixty Dutch vessels in U.3.harbours.On Oct. 20. M. Louaon, Dutch Minister of Foreign Affairs, stated that two proposals had been made by Holland to America for a settle-ment of the shipping difficulty.     One relates to the distribution of Dutch shipping now in American ports between Holland and the Belgian Relief Commission.   The other suggests placing a certain number of ships at the service of Belgian Relief.     No reply had been received from the U.S.Government although these proposals were made some months ago.(
good Supply.Between Sept. 22 and Oct. 10 the prices of salt, bacon and milk were fixed in Holland and the export of eggs limited.    The shortage of fat has led to stricter control of its transport and sale.     The shortage of bread is still acute.     Potatoes are rationed and tea and coffee cards are instituted.general feeling in Holland.Before the present Anglo-Dutch conflict on the gravel question entailing the stoppage of Dutch Commercial telegrams in so far as they are sent by British cables, the mass of the people m*y have been said to be frankly hostile to Germany.), and this although the Central Powers still have many friends in the army and among the upper classes:   it does not however follow thfct the masses were necessarily pro-Ally.It now remains to be seen whether their view3 will undergo any change in consequence of the present difference;   but as long as their pockets are not deeply touched thereby, it is to be presumed that their feelings will not be greatly affected.Views of the Dutch Press regarding the prospects of peace.These are frankly pessimistic owing chiefly to the declarations of the British and French Governments and Herr von Ktthlmann re-garding the Alsace-Lorraine question.     The bro-German newspapers in Holland had hoped that England would have declined to continue the war if the possession of Alsace-Lorraine by France were the principal territorial question at issue,     Mr. Lloyd George&apos;a declaration that England will 3tand by France in this matter has, therefore, been a blow not only to the pro-German Press but also to those Dutch publicists who favour a peace by arrangement.     The
Dutch Pacifists and .such organs as support them may he said to look forward to an understanding   between the Liberal elements in all belligerent countries as the only influence which may bring about peace in the present and maintain it in the future.     Meanwhile the prospect is, they admit, a dark one, and they expect a onntinuance of the war during the winter and spring of next year.Economic Agreements between Holland and the Central Empires.The following are the main terms of the German-Butch coal agreement The Netherlands Government are,before ratifying it, awaiting the settlement of certain matters concerning which negotiations are in progress.The Agreement will be in force from Oct. 1 to April 1st. 1.
