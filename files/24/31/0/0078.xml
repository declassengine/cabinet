[This Docnmant is the Property of His Britannic Majestys Government.]SECRET.MINISTRY OF MUNITIONS AND AMERICANSTEEL.ON page 2 of his Memorandum of the 7th instant Sir Auckland Geddes refers to tfie arrangement which, lias been made between the Ministry cf Munitions and tlie United States representatives to supply them with. 30,000 tons of discard steel for the erection of the hospital huts for the American troops in France, and he states that it is &quot; obvious that this steel could have, been used to greater advantage in many other ways, and that the whole transaction shows a serious lack of co-ordination and a complete disregard of the rulings of the War Cabinet.&quot; These are severe remarks to make on the Departmental conduct of a Ministerial colleague, and I think that before they were published to the wide circles of those who receive War Cabinet papers, it would have been convenient if Sir Auckland Geddes had very kindly given me the opportunity of explaining to him the circumstances in which the Ministry of Munitions agreed to issue the 30,000 tons of steel in question to the Americans. He would then have learned, among other things, that these 30,000 tons of steel were not a free gift or an ordinary sale, but part of a bargain ; and that the Americans have promised in exchange for them 10,000 tons of ship-plates to Lloyds&apos; specification, 20,000 tons in billets and slabs (specifications for both of which have already been sent to America), and 20,000 tons of timber, - material much higher in total money value and some of it more urgent in our schemes of priority than the 30,000 tons of sheets and shell-discard steel with which the American hospitals in France will be built. It is intended that the shipbuilding material shall go to swell the quantities with which we are now endeavouring to satisfy the First Lord of the Admiralty.The placing of large foreign orders in this country is certainly to be deprecated. But very wide questions of policy affecting the Foreign Office and the Board of Trade are involved, and I trust that the Minister of National Service will be one, and only one, of the authorities concerned in taking final decisions in such matters. In minor affairs my predecessors at the Ministry of Munitions have always exercised a certain power of accommodation with Allied Governments to meet, their urgent needs from time to time ; and often at very short notice wre have assisted them by gift or loan, with grants of munitions of many kinds, and they in return have frequently assisted us when we, for the moment, have run short of particular com-modities. AVithin reasonable limits, such as have always been observed, this form of reciprocal assistance is not only beneficial but indispensable to the smooth transaction of our business.   The excellent relations established by
the present Prime Minister, when Minister of &quot;Munitions, with. M. Thomas and General Dallolio have continued to this day between the Munitions Departments of the three countries with great advantage. It is hoped that-similar relations may be established with the United States; and certainly, having regard to our dependence on the United States for the vital elements in our Munitions Programme for 1918, there is no task which should be more earnestly pursuedWINSTON S. CHURCHILL.November 9, 1917.o
