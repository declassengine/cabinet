FIW/017.The new Ministry has been constituted as follows under thewasPresidency of Signor Orlando, Baron Sonnino having, as/expected,declined the task.President of Council and Minister of InteriorForeign AffairsColoniesGracet  Justice and Public WorshipFinanceTreasuryWarMarineArme and MunitionsMilitary Assistance and PensionsPublic InstructionPublic WorksAgricultureIndustry, Commerce and LabourPosts -:.nd Telegrcphs.Transports (Shinning tnd Railways)Signor Orlando.Baron Sonnino.Signer Colosimo.   &apos;&quot;      Sacchi.&quot;      Mete.&quot;      NittiGeneral Alfieri.Admiral Del Bono.General Dallolio.Signor Bissolati.&quot;     Berenini.&quot;    Dari.&quot;    Miliani.&quot;     Ciuffelli.&quot;    Fere.&quot;     Ricccrdo Bi..nchi.It will be noticed that the new Cabinet contains only 16 mem-bers (..S compared with the SI of 3oselli&apos;s Ministry) end no Ministers without Portfolio.     This lightening of the ship is re-gsrded as likely to moke for cohesion r.niS efficiency.
The balance of parties in the Cabinet remains much as it was before, so that the Ministry may be said to retain its National1 character or perhaps rather to represent, by virtue of Signor Nitti fs presence, 1,&apos;union sacree - the bridging of the gulf which has for the past 2 years divided Italian society.     It is even stated on good authority that an attempt was made by Signor Bitti to secure the inclusion Of Turati, leader of the Official Socialists, in the Chamber.Of the new Ministers - Signer Hitti, a native of Apulia, was Minister of Agriculture in Giolitti&apos;s last Cabinet.     He is Professor of Statistical Science at the Naples Athenaeum and an authority on Finanoe.     His special hobby is the &quot;white ooal1 question - the utilisation of water-power in order to lessen the need of imported cotl by the substitution of electricity.Signor Dari comes from the Liberal Right - the group with which Signor Salandra is identified.     He was for 4 years Under Secretary of Public Works in Giolittifs Government and afterwards Minister of Justice in Salandrars first Ministry.Signor Ciuffelli comes from the province of Perugia.     After many years in the Civia Service he became Post-Master in a Cioiittisn Cabinet and Minister of Public Works in Salandra&apos;s Government.Signor Berenini was in early life a zealous member of the old Socialist party but left it, along with Bissolati, Bonomi and others, at the time when the division took place between the Reformist and Official Socialists.     He is a leader of the Reformist party and a strong &quot;interventionist&apos; from the first.Signor Miliani    a Liberal of the Left - proprietor of paper-mills at Fabriano - a specialist in agrarian and financial matters.
- 3 -General Alfieri having become Minister of V/ar, Signor Crespi, an Industrial magnate and one of the proprietors of the Corrierf -delle lera, has been appointed Food Controller in his place. I      The horoscope of the new Government is difficult to cast.     For [he present its action is strictly conditioned by the pressing needs If the moment - supnort of the army and maintenance of concord and Insistence in the people.     Moreover the retention of so many members If the former Cabinet and in particular of Baron Sonnino and Signor lissolati guarantees continuity of policy at least as regards the lilies and the gar.     Nevertheless the presence of Signor Nitti   and the fu&apos;l acceptance of the principle of reconciliation with Neutralism, [for which he stands, introduces a new and ambiguous element which may lath time extend its influence.     (The fact that Signor Nitti is pub-lishing a scheme for the union of the Latin races, regarded as a bunt er too is e to the great Slav, Teutonic and Anglo-Saxon blocs, may perhaps be an indication of the tendency of his thought in inter-Rational politics).     Much will depend upon the line taken by the new President of the Council who, strangely enough, is the unknown quan-tity in the new combination.     Nothing seems to be certain about him except his ability, his eloquence and his ambition.     Signor Orlando pas telegraphed to Signor Giolitti, confirming his old friendship, and saying that all party differences must be forgotten   for patriot-io union towards victory;    and Signor Giolitti has replied to the effect that all Italians must feel it to be their duty to support the Government with full faith in the destinies of their country. It is expected moreover that Signor Giolitti,&apos; who has not appeared in Parliament since the *days of May&apos; will be in his place when the Chamber reassembles on Saturday.The Catholics, who had been preparing a vigorous onslaught upon the   Minister for Foreign Affairs on the ground of his disrespectful
treatment of the Papal Note in his speech of Oct. 25th, have an-nounced their decision to lay aside polemics for the present in viewof the urgent need for national unity.     Prominent Churchmen haveissued appeals to the people to display calmness and faith in thashour of danger and trial.The peri 1 which threatens the nation which they disown hasmade still more pronounced the division already discernible in theOfficial Socialist party.     The Right Wing of the ParliamentaryGroup is ready to co-operate with the lbourgeois&apos; Government, whilethe Official Socialist Municipal Council of Milan has published astirring apoeal to all citizens, and this example has been followedhy numerous Laboufc organisations throughout the country.     Meanwhile Partythe/Executive remains obstinate in its rigid Sectarianism and calls uoon the rank and file to remain faithful to the discipline of the party which allows no loyalties save those of the Glass War and the International.The Press is doing its utmost to maintain public moral and, while not concealing the seriousness of the situation, maintains that it is not desperate and may even be the prelude to a general effort of the Entente such as may inflict a decisive defeat upon the enemy.     The prompt decision of the Allies to send troops to the Italian front is cordially applauded by the Press which, while grateful for the sympathy and timely help given to Italy, prefers generally to regard the action of the Allies as a tardy but welcome recognition of the much dismissed unity of front and the importance of its Southern sector as the theatre on whioh a mortal blow may be der.lt to the enemy in his weakest spot.As f...r as one c..n tell, the Itc.li.Jis ^re still under the im-pres3ion th:.t the hostile attack was carried out by large masses of German troops, partly belonging to the German &apos;army of manoeuvre1,
,d partly withdrawn from the Russian front;    it is described as no re helping of Austria by Germany but a combined action with definite -mS - military and political - and a definite agreement   between the ,0 powers.     The force is said to include even Bulgarian and Turkish its so that all 4 Allies are represented.     No official statement the subjeot has, so far as we know, yet been published in Italy. The Italian naval communique of Nov. 3rd reported intense na^al ctivity in the Gulf of Trieste and a Paris journal on the 4th calls he attention of the Allies te the possibilities ef naval action in he Adriatic     On the German side Count Reventlaw in the. Deutsche ageaaeltmig.  urges1 that this is the moment fcr Austria to secure nee for all mastery of the Adriatic and emphasises the importance f the Adriatic to the German Empire as an avenue to the Mediterranean nd towards the *freein^of the geasTM. Venizelts arrived in Rome on Nov. End, and the Times correspondent in Athens is informed that the Greek Soreign Offifce :as received (Nov. 5th)a telegram from the Greek Minister in Rome aying that M. Venizelos&apos; meeting with Signor Orlando had been ntirely satisfactory and that an understanding had been established )D all questions hitherto in dispute between Greece and.Italy.Friendly telegrams have been exchanged between Signor Orlando nd M. Pu)sic.     In his speech in the Ohamber on Oct. 25th Brron onninoreferred to Italo-Slav relations in most conciliatory ems.     While legitimate defence in the Adriatic, he said, was one of Italy&apos;s essential ?md indisputable war-aims,, from the ethnical point of view her ideals were essentially conciliatory and in every *y respectful of the Slav peoples.     It was natural that this should 3e so whereat was a question off territories of mixed population, not-^ithstanding the high value - economic,      historical and political -cf the purely Italian centres on the further shore of the Adriatic.
Italy&apos;s policy was inspired by the necessity for reciprocal sacrifices and concessions and aimed at establishing a state of things which should permit in the future of the most loyal, cordial and friendly oo-operation and fellowship of the Italian raoe with the Slav race, which was their neighbour.With regard to the Near East he said that Italy was on political and economic grounds and on account of her emigrants interested In the Mediterranean but had no positive aspirations there.     She only desired equilibrium and a fair distribution of spheres of influence after the war.     Her function in the Mediterranean was to maintain balance of power and to constitute a precious guarantee for the future peace of Europe.
