Italy, To C.I.G.S., War Office.Handed in 5.10 a.&apos;m. Received   1,50 p.m.10^h November, 1917.629.        November 9th,Situation this evening.3rd Army is entirely withdrawn to right bank of Piave.     Priula Bridge blown up 5,30 this evening after enemy had fired at it with medium artillery to prevent this.   It Is stated that all the bridges have been completely destroyed.Artillery now in position on front of 3rd Army as follows t- on the Sile twenty one naval guns of 4, 6, 8 and 12 inches and six field guns.   Behind Piave 120 siege guns, 158 heavy field guns and howitzers and 490 field and mountain guns. These are being added to.Entrenchments along the Piave still very rudimentary, 3rd Army has fourteen brigades in front of line and six In reserve.     Brigades very much reduced In strength.   Duke of Aosta said this evening he has average of about 2,500 bayonets per brigade.   Troops are tired and he evidently had doubts as to their capacity for holding the Piave line If the enemy makes a determined attack.Withdrawal of the 4th Army is nearly completed. It has brought down all artillery and material.   General Robilant this evening said that his battalions are weak, having received no drafts for four months. All available drafts were sent to 2nd and 3rd Armies.Occupation of Monte Grappa has been comp3.eted. But Robilant is concerned as to the conditions under which
troops must live at first as the top is under&quot;snow*and-there-are no hutments or other arrangements for comfort of troops anywhere on this part of the line,Montello position on right bank of Piave is for the present oooupied by remnants of the 2nd Army Corps under General Albriccl with the 24th Corps under General Caviglia in support.Albricci!s force amounts to three brigades each about 2,000 strong of the 2nd Army Corps and one brigade about 4,000 strong from the 9th Army Corps.   These troops will be relievod two days hence by 4th Army troops and will be withdrawn to rest and reform,     Albriccl with 10,000 men has to watch river front of 20 kilometres.     He has 114 machine guns, 200 medium and field guns and six searohlights in position.     There are some entrenchments on top of Montello but along the river bank machine guns are in pits which aro being conneoted with sections of trenches,, Bridge head at Vidor is held by one brigade each of Bersaglleri, cyclists and assault troops.     It is expected enemy will close on to the bridge head tonight or tomorrow when the troops will be withdrawn and bridge destroy-8d.     Albrlcoi says his troops are we3.1 in hand and ready to fight but are verj tired,     2*VLh division of the 12th Corps has made its way to the Belluno road and is withdrawing in safety with 4th Army.     It had some sharp fighting on the Mauria Pass and is being pressed by small enemy detachments which however are kepo at arms length.     It appears that bulk of 36th division was surrounded at Monte San Simeone on right bank of the Tagliamento S.E. of Tolmezzo.     It had occupied defensive works hers but was forced to surrender on November 6thj   it is believsd that detachments of the $3rd division have extricated themselves and retiring west but no definite news yet received.
Troops of the 20th division wer-e. seen tonight marching, in good order on the right of&apos; the Piave after passing by the Priula Bridge.Troops in position on piave appear quite well In hand but their !moral1 evidently not high.     It is clear that the Army commanders and commanders ef units are very doubtful that the line can be held in case of any serious and prolonged attack by the enemy.Owing to withdrawal of the line to Monte Grappa it will be possible now for the enemy to oross the Piave unmolested higher up .and attack Italian lines on right bank.There are as yet no dispositions whatever fur taking up positions on second or subsequent lines In oase Piave line should be forced, nor have any arrangements been made to allot roads to various units for retirement, or for construction of bridges over the rivers in the area.Evacuation of remnants of the 2nd Army almost ocmplete and they are now almost all in their allotted concentration areas and roads are now free of the congestion of transport columns,Of the British batteries ten guns are in position behind Piave east of Treviso and remainder sent to Ferr&amp;ra to report. Ammunition has been received and sufficient traotors and motor lorries have been allotted to enable guns to be withdrawn if necessary and for the purpose arrangements are being made to bridge Sile at a convenient point,French Army of four divisions under General Duchesne is concentratedaround Brescia west of Garda, cannot therefore in any case take part in the action on the Piave fOr some days.Detraining of two British divisions begins at Mantua tomorrow and will be completed&quot;ab6ut IWvenY-ev 20th,
