Colonel Jones (This Document is the Property of7His Britannic Majesty&apos;^ Government,)457&quot;Report of Meeting- lie Id at. Ministry of Munitions on Saturday November 3rd, 1917, to discTLss-iOie- follurwing War Cabinet Minute.       ^ &quot;P3CSEBT: Sir Glynn West.     )Mr. W. T. Layton.  ))Mr, Maclean. )Ministry of Munitions.Captain Hendley R.N. ) Admiralty.General Byron,) War Office^Repair of Ant&amp;-Airoraft Guns.&quot;The Minister of Munitions pointed out that the wear and tear of anti-aircraft guns was at present very unevenly distributed These oruns were used both for home defence against air raids and anti-aircraft defences on the various fronts, and for the defensive arming of shipping.   During tho previous month and the period of the harvester&apos;s moon, the cruns of the London barrage had been subjected to a very .severe test.   Raids conducted on five or six successive nights mi/? .   place the suns of the b^rr-vge completely ottt oi action,   While n^t hi self a great believer iif the efficacy of the barrage system of defence against air raids, he thought the above was a possibility which required the most serious consideration. Ke strongly advocated, as a measure to meet this emergency, that there should be a free and constant interchange of anti-aircraft guns so that there might be no undue strain upon any particular set of guns, and for purposes of repair, so that the life of each gun might be equally prolonged so far as is feasible.   His Ministry had made all arrangements to deal with the relinint of such mins, within practical limits. *The War Cabinet concurred in this view., and decided that -The Minister of Munitions -should take the neces.\ry action to ^ive effect to his proposal, in concert with the Admiralty find the War Office. &quot;
1.   The.urgency of this question is very much less than it was when the proposal was first raised by the Ministry of Munitions owing to fa) tho fact that expenditure of Anti-aircraft ammunition has up to the present been much lest than was forecast during the period of the raids Of the harvest noon and (b) the life of the 3&quot; A-A. guns has been greatly increased by the supply of barrage ammunition with a reduced charge and the application of a lubricant to the driving band of the shell,   She question, however remains serious owing to the probability of early condemnations of guns in Franco which have been changed round until they are nearly all much reduced in life02.     It would be unwise to change guns from the various fronts with the Navy and with merchant ships until the whole stock is worn out, as they could c:-t   &quot;hen be replaced or repaired.   The services should, therefore, take steps to   utiliso as far as possible the -full repair capacity which the Ministry has at its disposition.   But it is necessary that there should be a larger number or guns out of action than are being repaired at any one moment, otherwise there will be a break in production.   Thus up to th.9 li lit of repair capacity (which is about 20 guns repaired a month&apos;requiring GO runs, in transit,    ander inspection or actually in the factory) the rate of repair is governed by the number of guns which the services can afford to have out of action.3o     If wear suddenly increased for a short period in excess of the new and repaired guns comin.? iorvrard from the factories j)*N,0, and M.g,0. will arrange for transfer between the services subject to:the condition that the life of the guns being put on merchant ships must not have lobt more than the equivalent of COO complete rounds of thsir full life. - Below this li. It accuracy is insufficient.   Such&apos;transfers should only be made after consultation with the Ministiy of Munitions,
4.   D.JJ.O. has agreed to allow D.D.0*S. to hold 22 new guns at l/oolwich in reserve on condition that the War Office undertakes to hand back to the Wavy in case of emergency either these Or partially worn guns (as defined in 13.)12.11.17
