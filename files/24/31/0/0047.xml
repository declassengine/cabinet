ANDREW SQUARE,EDINBURGH. l3t November,  1917.(Agricultural Labour. I am dlreotod by the Board of Agriculture for Scotland to inform you that they have been in communication with the War Office and National Servico Department with % view to obtaining a supply of labour to enable farmers in Scotland to undertake the work of the additional cropping for 1918 harvest.     It has been arranged that 5000 men of Categories B2, B3 and C will-be released from the Army for agricultural work, and farmers who wish to avail themselves of the services of such men should make early application on Form A.0.2 to the Agricultural Executive Committee for their district.     A considerable number of those men are already on farms in connection with the harvesting of the 1917 crop, and the farmers by whom they are employed have been asked to report on their capabilitiec and willingness to work.     Such men as are favourably reported on will be kept in Labour Companies, but will, as far as possible, be allowed to remain on the farms on which they have been working if applications for their retention are made by the farmers concerned.Every effort should be made by farmers in their own interests, as well as in those of tho country generally, to train these men in ploughing and other expert work on the farm as soon as possible.     The Board arc of opinion that such training /strict Agricultural Executive Committee,
training can be given with greater advantago on the farms rather than in apeoial training centres.The wages to be paid tb these men will be at the rates fixed for the district by the Distriot Agricultural Committees for the different classed of farm labour.     Farmers will not, therefore, be expected to pay to unskilled or half-trained men tho samo wages as they do to experienced workers.     So soon, however, as mon of the former ^lass are certified to be skilled labourers thoy will of course require to be paid at tho higher rates.The Board would urge upon farmers the necessity of making oarly application for tho supply of such extra labour ac they roquiro.     There are at present at various centres a oonsider-:able number of men waiting employment on farms, and any who are not applied for by farmers will have to be returned to their Units, from which there would undoubtedly be great difficulty In getting them released again for farm work if required at a later date.Under arrangement with the War Offioo no farm labourer oan now be oallod to the colours without the consent of the Board, and the Board will take care that no farmerfe position in regard to farm labour is in any way pre judiced by the fact that ho has secured extra soldier labour.     The fact that ho has such labour on his farm will not bo admitted as a relevant argument In favour of taking away any of his regular farm hands.     The soldier labour with which this circular deals is to bo regarded as supplemental to the ordinary supply and is provided with a view to enabling farmers to moet the Increased domands made upon them at the present crisis.The Board will be obliged if your Committoe will be so good as to take the necossary stops to bring the foregoing inform-:ation to tho notice of farmers In your distriot.I am, Sir,Your obedient Servant, H.M. CONAOHEH, Secretary.
Any further communications should be addressed, not to any individual by name,but. to-&quot;The Secretary,Board of Agriculture for Scotland, , 29 St. Andrew Square,Edinburgh.&quot;Correspondents are requested  1 To quote the Number, Date, and Heading of each letter to which they reply; and) To let communications, on different subjects form separate letters.Telegraphic Address-&quot;BOAS, EDINBURGH.&quot;Sir,Training, of Discharged and Disabled Sailors an&apos;^oOTVrs IS^uraT oVou^a-glona &quot;*I am direated &quot;by the Board of Agriculture for Scotland to state that in the course of their administration of the Small Holdings Colonies Act 1916, whioh empowers them to ao quire land up to a maximum of 2000 aores for the purpose of providing experimental small holding colonies primarily for&quot; the &quot;benefit of persons who have served in the naval or military forces in the present war, their attention has been drawn to the fact that the number of men who can thus be provided for must necessarily be limited.     The Board have therefore had under consideration the possibility of securing an extension of the facilities for enabling discharged sailors and soldiers to resume agricultural work, or in oertain oases to take it up for the first time, on their return to civil life, or to combine some rural occupation with the tenancy of a house and a croft or allotment, and it appears to them that ax)art from any direct action by a public Department the existing machinery of the Housing and Town Planning Act 1909 and the Allotments Aots 1892 might be utilised for this purpose.In thiB connection the Board desire to draw the attention of the District Committee to a comprehensive soheme at rural settlement for ex-sailors and soldiers which thoy have had under consideration in conjunction with the Lftnistry of Pensions and of which the following is an outlineThe scheme is conceived with a view to cultivating intensively these areae of land at present surrounding rural villages rather than setting up new rural snail holdings and requires no new legislative machinery to set it in notion, as it makes full use of existing organisations.     The advantages thus gained are that disabled and other dia-:oharged nen could almost immediately be provided for, instead of waiting possibly fer years for a place in a new small holdings colony if and when formed.     The authors of the scheme- do not favour a system of herding disabled men together in colonies, barracks er similar grouping, but rather seek to absorb them in gradually inoreasing numbers into existing village communities.   While the scheme has primarily in view the settling of our soldiers and Bailors, it would tend to promote by using and extending existing village communities the regeneration of country life, and would bring within easy reach of our farmers throughout the country an additional reservoir of labour, whioh could he drawn upon, and whioh is much needed, 1  the cultivation of the soil is to be maintained at a proper standard,     G?ho method tf procedure suggested is as follows(1)   that the appropriate Oc^eaasment Department call upon rural Local Authorities (in Sool^and the Local Government District Committees) to uiidertako a surrey ftf such villages lying within their reaped      areas of d^jniniatraticn as may T3e agreed on beiwee the Local authority/BOARD OF AGRICULTURE FOR SCOTLAND,29 ST. ANDREW SQUARE,EDINBURGH. * 1st November 1917.
2- 224Authority and. the 3o&apos; rd of Agriculture with a view to selecting suitable villages for the purpose of the &quot;housing, training, and setting np in rural occupations &quot;of discharged and disabled soldiers and sailors.&quot;(2)    Bash Looal Authority should forward for consideration and approval by the appropriate Government Department a Memorandum, accompanied by a complete scheme and a financial statement of their proposals, such scheme to show the number and class of men it has been designed to absorb.Each local authority would conduct inquiries into a fairly large number of villages to form tho centres of the proposed developments, and those villages which proved to be the&quot;most suitable would then be considered and schemes con-;oerning them submitted to the appropriate Government Dopart-: ent.     I:. conducting the above inquiries locel authorities should obtain evidenoe from all classes of the community inter-:ested and full use of the staffs of the     ricultural Colleges should be made available for advioe and assistance with regard to the selection of land, and co-operation between the local authorities and the Board of Arieulture and Local Government Br&amp; should be maintained.T&apos; ore should accompany each local authority1;; scheme a proper village extension plan which should indicate the oxisting dwelling houses which it is proposed should be altered, extended or ronovated, and those pieces of land which could be purchased or leasod for allotments or carrying on other rural industries,     This plan would also show the lines on which any further extension o.-: the village would proceod, together with new roads and other services which mi&apos;5&apos;ht be required in connection therewith.   A map should also accompany each schome showing the areas of land within reason-:f.ble distance of the villages that would be suitable for afforestation, also any land which could be suitably reclaimed or brought into use for agricultural purposes.     T -? local authorities would state the number of men that they could at once absorb within their respective villages, and by means of a balance sheet shov? the estimated outlay and income, in order that the Government ml^ht be in a position to consider how best any temporary deficit could be mat.   It is presumed that disabled men will be in reoeipt of a substantial pension and consequently able to pay from that sourco and from their earnings an economic rent for their land and buildings.     They would be the first applicants to be provided for, and it is suggested that immediate provision could be made if existing buildings were made available.The rango of rural occupations which it is thought mi$ht be set no include a limited number of small holdings for men with previous experience, specially for the production of milk, butter end cheese, and rearing of stock, a ler^e proportion of allotments suitable for market-gardening, fruit-growing, poultry-keeping, pig-keeping, bee-keeping, growing of certain crops under glass, or a comoination of the fore-: :oing.     Tr e formation ox forest nurseries is su^ested, and the possibility of setting up through co-operative methods rural occupations such as bacon-curing and fruit-bottling, and of instituting jam factories and in oases where the villages lie within dairying districts, cheese factories and creameries.To/
To carry out these schemes, it is recommended that a Central D-vot he established and at the first retained in the hands of the local authority, and put under the management of a capable nan who v/ould have to possess a fairly wide knowledge of agriculture, horticulture and rural occupations. Iv connection with this Depot there mi^ht be a labour bureau for the district and an insurance system whereby the allotment -and small nolders might insure their stock.     There mi^ht also be kept for -lire such agricultural implements as allotment holders and small holders could not reasonably be expected to purchase themselves, and an arrangement might be made for the collection and sale of produce at the best procurable prices, and the provision of seeds and manures - workshops for rural handicrafts night also be opened at the Gontral Depot.As regards training the men, it is thought that the manager of the Central Depot and the staffs of the Agricultural Colleges night all participate in the work, and that a demonstration garden and allotment should be opened and con-:ducted by the latter at each village.     T e men would as far as possible be settled in such a way as to use their natural gifts or in an occupation of which they had some imouled^e.The scheme as given in outline above appears to the 3o.^rd to have distinctive merits of its own which should contend it to local authorities as the basis of action under the statutes already referred to in the interests of returned sailors and soldiers.     Toe Boord would be glad therefore to be favoured with an expression of the views of the District Committee on the subject, and if they agree as to the general soundness of the scheme, perhaps they mi^ht give an indication of the extent to which after local inquiry they ni/jht bo prepared to exercise their powers with a view to the acquisition of land and houses in the neighbourhood of existing villages within their district, and at the same time it would be a favour if the Committee would give a list of selected villages which they think would be suitable for the purpose in view.    It is suggested further that the District Committee might consult the rural Parish Councils in their area as to the extent to which they would be prepared to use their statutory pov/ers to provide allotments for the purpose in views.I am to add that with a view to co-onsration with District Committees the Board for their part&quot;might probably be able to use some of their pov/ers undir the 3riall Holding Colonies Aot 1916 to promote proposals of this kind.I am, Sir, 1&apos;our obedient Servant,H.M. COiUCHEJ:,Secretary.
