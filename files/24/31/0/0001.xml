(This Pocumtnt i; tht Property gT OPERATIONS^ BntanniT^g^n CfwcrnmwRET.CAEttJ^^,.   General Delme Radcliffe, Italy.War Office.546&quot;. November 2nd.Handed in 3/11/17. Received   3/11/17.4.35 a.in.5.45 a.m.position November 2nd. 3rd Army.   Enemy attacked bridge-head at Latisana.    Italian troops were withdrawn to right bank and bridge then blown up. 3rd Army holds right bank up to beyond Fonte Delia Delizia.2nd Army is all across now.   From the left of 3rd Army up to Spilimbergo, the 15 kilometres of river bank are occupied by units of various corps of 2nd Army amounting to about 15,000 rifles in all with a good many machine guns and about 40 batteries of artillery.   Some searchlights are also in position.   As the river bed is about 3000 yards wide and is all shingle and sand and difficult to dig trenches in it is hoped that this line can be held for a day or two longer.   Above Spilimbergo is General Di Giorgiols detachment with an additional brigade.   The enemy attacked Ragogna in some strength yesterday employing medium and field artillery.   Italian troops according to instructions withdrew and blew up bridge.   3rd, 4th and 5th Cavalry Division are concentrated at Aviano 1st Cavalry Division comprising Genoa, Novara, Rome and Monferrata regiments was practically wiped out near Campo Formido, average of only 150 men per regiment returning.     Aircraft reconnaissances show main body of the enemy is about Meridian of Udine with advanced *   guards moving towards the river.   Troops guns and material are being brought from Udine to Oodroipo by rail, as the Italians left rolling.stock and 12 engines at Udine intact.River in places now fordable,   Enemy has made one or two unsuccessful attempts to push patrols across about Dignano, and last nig^it patrol which crossed in a boat. was. captured.    Carnia force is settling down on its new line.   4th Army is moving its heavy stores and when retirement to the Piave is ordered willSome guns are in position as well as a good many machine guns.
withdraw its troops,   Arrangements for this retirement are beingworked out and it is hoped to be able to effect it in a metho&amp;ieamanner.   Whole civil population between the 2 rivers is to beevacuated by November 4th after which no one will be allowed tocross bridges of the Piave.     New bridges are being made on thePiave at Palazzone, Porlina Salgareda and Noventa,   There arealready 2 bridges at San Dona Di Piave, 2 at Ponte Di Piavev 2 atSusegana and 1 at Vidor or in all 11 bridges.     Dividing linebetween the two Armies is Oderzo, Gorgo Meduna, Azzanello, AzzanoDecimo, Villanuova, San Vita Al Tagliamento, Communale andPonte Delia Delizia,   Within the area of each Army Separate roadhas been allotted to each divisiona   Country is being inundatedbelov; San Dona,   During retirement intention is to halt on theLivenza and again on the Monticano River^   Both rivers requirebridging, so it is hoped to delay enemy*s advance for a few daysuntil the Piavo line is securely occupied.   Commando Supremo*hopes it will not be necessary to order retirement before November 4th towards the Piave, if then, and that it can be prolonged for 5 or 6 days and be carried out in good order^ then owing to strength of Piave line on which many thousands of labourers are working it is expected enemy will not attack in force till arrival of his heavy artillery, owing to distance, difficulty of ground and number of rivers to cross, it will require some 10 days to bring this up.     Consequently attack in force no  likely before November 15th* If in the meantime rivers rise again $ more time niay be gained 0Fugitives of 2nd Army are being passed through and beyond Treviso and are being collected and placed in concentration     ; camps to be re-armed and reformed,,     They show little signs of physical exhaustion and should soon recover cohesion.   Some seem ashamed of their conduct and many officers are hopeful that the troops will return to duty when they realize that their military strike has not led to the peace they were told to expect. Things have improved a little in the last two days in 3rd and 2nd Armies, but there is no denying that the troops do not look like
93.standing severe test yet.   Men of both armies are weary and hungry as the services are not yet in proper working order. If they fight protty well, time hoped for by the Commando Supremo may be gained, if not prospects will be bad, Bissolati, whom I saw to-day, and who has been amongst troops trying to ascertain their feelings seemed very despondent.   He said that men were lacking in spirit and apathetic.   He differed from the King to some extent and thought&quot; Pacifists and Socialists were responsible for instigating what was a military strike.   He said that Pope^ proclamation in a country where the poorer classes were still devout Roman Catholics or the women at any rate had done immense amount of harm.     He believed also that an act of treachery had been committed which permitted Germans to come through the line and that the spread of panic to the neighbouring Corps was due to lack of control by junior officers and the feel-ing of being surrounded felt by the men when the enemy began to move on to Clvidale.   On the other hand Army Commanders say they are confident that their troops will do their duty.   Next fow days must show.   If for the next fortnight or 3 weeks Italian troops can hold line of Piave whole situation may beisaved.   Country is taking crisis well.   German calculations of revolution in Italy have not been justified.     During November General Dallolio hopes to deliver some hundreds of new guns thanks to accelerated output.   There are rifles enough to t replace those lost and the 1899 class of recruits is said to be better than any former class and numbers about 200.000, About 36 divisions of tho Italian Army may be considered still efficient and this number should soon be increased.   The British and French reinforcements will give a considerable access of strength.   Approaching winter will make operations on tho Trentino mountains very difficult, and it should be easy to bar the valley approaches from North by which Austro-Gormans may endeavour to outflank Italian Army.   Thus Italian Army may be able to pass winter holding the Piavo and prepare for its
revenge when the Spring comes.    It is feared that if the Italian Army were to retire further, to the Uincio for instance, country would not hold out any nore and would demand peace * There are no direct sipns of offensive intention in the Trentino on the part of the eneny, but there are constant runours of transport of German troops in that direction.    If this offensive is not developed within next 3 weeks, its area of operations owing to snow will be considerably limited.
