SECRET.CP.129(58). .   &apos; Copy No.CABINET. Size of Capital Ships.Memorandum by the Pirst Lord of the Admiralty.We have now concluded our conversations with the representatives of the United States and it is clear that agreement on an upper tonnage limit for battleships cannot be reached on the basis of the respective require-ments of the two Powers.      The Americans would prefer no upper limit at all, but are prepared to agree to a treaty limit of 45,000 tons which will enable them to achieve their objective of 12 gun ships.      The Sea Lords recommend that so far as we are concerned, we should build ships of 40,000 tons which will give us well-balanced ships carrying 9 16&quot; guns.      The effect of building to the American limit would be, first, that we should not achieve a well-balanced ship, for it is the Admiralty view that a 12 gun ship requires a tonnage of 48,500, and secondly, that the construction of capital ships of this magnitude is undesirable on account of berthing and handling difficulties and would entail a large financial outlay in reconstruction of docks and naval ports.The action which the Admiralty propose is therefore -(a) to accept as the treaty limit an upper tonnage limit of 45,000 and of course the already established gun limit of 16&quot;.    It must be borne in mind that if we do not accept the American limit by
Admiralty, S.W.1.27th May, 1938.;-\:v:.;;! ;...-,::sthe end of June, there will he no limit at all - a state of affairs which, though highly acceptable to --   the United States, would he most detrimental to our interestsi. &quot; -(b) to notify European naval powers that we do not intend to build for the present capital ships beyond a limit of 40,000.My colleagues will appreciate that the difficulty in this matter is the situation between Russia and Japan;    if Japan feels it necessary to build to the new treaty limit it may well be that Russia will take the same line.    If this should happen, Germany will almost certainly follow suit.Our hope is that by means of our self-denying ordinance we may produce a European tonnage limit which will prevent this disintegrating process.... &quot;       -    .As my colleagues are aware, the cost of the 1937capital ship (35,000 tons with 14&quot; guns) is  8,000,000.The cost of the new proposed battleship mounting the already approved 16&quot; guns is  8.85 millions.    The cost of capital ships on the American model would be  11 millions plus theoutlay necessary to adapt the naval docks.    It will be.seentherefore that the Admiralty&apos;s proposal is at once the cheapest that is yet strategically and politically defensible-I ask the approval of the Cabinet for these proposals as it is necessary to proceed with the further negotiations and exchange of notes without delay.* - r-(Initialled)      D.C.
