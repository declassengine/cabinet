Printed for the Cabinet.   May 1938.Copy No.     48CABINET.FOOD, COAL AND OIL SUPPLIES IN WAR.Exchange of Information with the French and Belgian Governments.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.MY colleagues will recall that the Cabinet decided on the 27th April (Cabinet 21 (38), Conclusion 4) that &apos;&apos; at the forthcoming conversations with the French Government, the question of the exchange of information on the supply of food, oil and coal in war should be left to the discretion of the Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretary, who would bear in mind the views of their colleagues.&quot;This decision was the result of a letter which the Foreign Office wrote to the Committee of Imperial Defence on the 30th March (see Annex). This letter dealt with food, oil, coal, non-ferrous metals and minerals, textile raw materials and tonnage, and it was on the basis of this letter that the Cabinet discussion of the 27th April took place. It was accordingly, I think, through a misunderstanding that the Cabinet Conclusion only mentions the first three of these subjects. I would ask, therefore, that the Cabinet Conclusion of the 27th April should be altered so as to include all the subjects dealt with in the Foreign Office letter.There is one other point to which I would invite my colleagues&apos; attention. In accordance with a suggestion put forward by the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence at the same Cabinet meeting, the Committee of Imperial Defence were invited on the following day to consider the general policy to be followed and the machinery to be adopted for carrying out the conversations. At this meeting (Committee of Imperial Defence, 320th meeting), the Committee of Imperial Defence, after taking note of the Cabinet decision, took two decisions which would seem to somewhat contradictory. In the first place they decided that the conversations should be on the same general lines as those which had been followed in the case of the conversations about food-stuffs; and in the second place, they decided that in the first instance the conversations should not go further than the ascertainment of French requirements by the departments concerned, who should then apply to the Committee of Imperial Defence for further instruction. No such restriction was, in fact, imposed in the case of the conversations regarding food-stuffs. I would therefore ask my colleagues to authorise the cancellation of this second ruling, which, moreover, is not in conformity with the assurances given to the French Ministers at the Anglo-French meeting during their visit to London on the 28th-29th April. It would, of course, be understood that the Departments responsible for the conversations should refer back to the Committee of Imperial Defence any major questions of principle which might arise.Foreign Office, May 30, 1938.9893   [17304]SECRET. CP. 130 (38).
,   .... \ &apos; ; &apos; ANNEX.1419-B.COMMITTEE  OF  IMPERIAL  DEFENCE.EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION WITH THE BELGIAN AND FRENCH ... GOVERNMENTS ON THE SUPPLY OF FOOD, OIL AND COAL IN WAR.(Previous C.I.D. Paper No. 1396-B.)Copy of a Letter, dated March 30, 1938, from the Foreign Office to the Secretary, Committee of Imperial Defence.[C 2205/G] Sir,IN an official letter from this Department of the 1st February last (subsequently circulated as C.I.D. Paper No. 1396-B) the suggestion was made that, in view of the approaches either made or about to be made by the French and Belgian Governments on the subject of supplies in war-time, the question of the policy to be followed in any discussions with them on these subjects should be submitted for examination to an ad hoc. Committee, in order to ensure proper co-ordination and uniformity.2. So far as conversations with the Belgian Government are concerned, the position has been altered to some extent by the decision taken by the Cabinet &apos; on the 9th February last (Cabinet 4 (38)), as a result of which the policy to be followed in respect of Belgium can now be regarded as settled. As regards the proposed conversations with the French Government, there has also been some change in the position since the original suggestion was put forward. In the first place, the French Government have now, as a result of a further Cabinet decision of the 16th February (Cabinet 5 (38)), been informed that His Majesty&apos;s Government are prepared to authorise further confidential communi-cations on a technical footing between the British and French Air Staffs. Secondly, the anticipated approach by the French Government on the subject of coal has now been made; while, in addition, the French Government have indicated, through their Commercial Attache in London, and through an official of the Inspection generale des Subsistances (who has recently been in London for discussions with the Food (Defence Plans) Department), that they would also welcome an opportunity of discussing, on an unofficial and non-committal basis, the question of textile raw materials, non-ferrous metals, minerals and-tonnage.3. So far as food, textile raw materials, non-ferrous metals and minerals are concerned, the Commercial Secretary, on the instructions of his Government, suggested that the conversations should be directed, in the first place, towards an examination of the import requirements in war-time of the two Governments, and, in the second place, to an examination of the possibility of elaborating in advance arrangements for the, co-ordination of purchases of these commodities in order to avoipl competition in foreign markets and a resultant inflation of prices. As regards coal and tonnage, the object of the conversations would be to ascertain what assistance, if any, His Majesty&apos;s Government would be able to render to the French Government out of their own resources, and, if the result were to show that no substantial assistance could be expected, to make arrange-ments for obtaining assistance from&apos;third countries. Finally, as regards oil, the object would be to examine the question of war requirements and tanker tonnage in order that the French Government might make arrangements in advance for the chartering of tonnage from neutral countries.
(Signed) WILLIAM STRANG.4. For this purpose, the Commercial Secretary said that the French &quot;Government were ready to place at the disposal of His Majesty&apos;s Government full particulars of their own estimated requirements in war-time, as well as details of the plans which they had prepared for meeting those requirements.! They were particularly anxious that nothing in those plans should conflict with any arrangements which His Majesty&apos;s Government had already made, and they felt that it would be helpful if some sort of provisional arrangement could be evolved now for the. establishment of such joint purchasing commissions as might be necessary in an emergency.5. So far as the actual conduct of the conversations is concerned, the French Government would be glad to send over an expert during the next week or two to open discussions on the subject of coal; the official of the Inspection generale des Subsistances was responsible not only for food, but also for textiles, and would he prepared to discuss this matter when he returned to England early in May; and experts could be sent over at the same time to deal with the remaining subjects, namely, tonnage, oil, non-ferrous metals and minerals.6. In view of the more precise and comprehensive statement of the French Governments desiderata which has now been received, I am directed by the Viscount Halifax to suggest that the question of holding informal conversations with the French Government for the purpose of economic collaboration in the event of war should again be submitted to the Committee of Imperial Defence. In the event of the proposal being approved in principle, Lord Halifax would propose that the general policy to be followed and the machinery to be adopted for carrying out the conversations may be as follows : (1) that the French Government should be informed that His Majesty&apos;s Government are prepared to instruct the appropriate Departments to enter into informal conversations with French technical experts on the subjects of oil, coal, textile raw materials, tonnage, non-ferrous metals and minerals, and that the discussions already proceeding in regard to food should be continued on their present basis;(2) that it should be made clear to the French Government that no commit-ments can be entered into in advance, and that the actual execution of any arrangements discussed must be dependent upon the approval of the Government of the day;(3) that the conversations on each subject should be conducted by the Department or Departments principally concerned, the Foreign Office being informed as to the progress of the discussions in order to ensure co-ordination between the different subjects and with the parallel conversations with the Belgian Government;(4) that, in the event of there being any conflict between the desiderata of the French and Belgian Governments, priority should, in general, be given to the former.*   *   *   *
