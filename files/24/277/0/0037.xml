Printed for the Committee of Imperial Defence.   June 1938.SECRET.14450-B.Copy No.COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE.BRITISH MILITARY MISSION TO PORTUGAL. (Previous C.I.D. Paper No. 1355-B.)Copy of a Letter, dated June 25, 1938, from the Foreign Office to the Secretary, Committee of Imperial Defence.Sir, Foreign Office, June 25, 1938.WITH reference to Foreign Office letter No. W 6321/146/36, transmitting copy of an interim report* on the work of the &quot;British Military Mission to Portugal, I am directed by Viscount Halifax to enclose herein a memorandum prepared in this Department in regard to the Mission, and to express the hope that this subject may be considered by the Committee of Imperial Defence at the earliest convenient opportunity.*. -it,w &quot;A&quot;(Signed)WALTER ROBERTS.Enclosure.Memorandum by the Foreign Office.THE period of three months provisionally suggested as the length of the Mission&apos;s visit to Portugal expired on the 20th May, but was extended with no fixed date given for their withdrawal.From Admiral Wodehouse&apos;s last report* on the work of the Mission, dated the 6th May, it seems clear that, whilst satisfactory progress had been made in respect of certain questions contained in the Mission&apos;s terms of reference, progress had been painfully slow in respect of others, and that, at that date at any rate, much remained to be done if agreement was to be reached on many of the subjects under discussion.Two &quot;subjects have overshadowed in importance all others discussed by the Mission : (1) The supply of armaments to the Portuguese Government.(2) The proposed exchange of assurances by which, briefly, His Majesty&apos;s Government undertook to abide by her treaty obligations in respect of Portugal, and the latter undertook to place her armaments contracts in the United Kingdom.The first question has during the last year or more been under frequent and urgent consideration. It is fully realised that, for political and military reasons, great benefit would be derived from the placing of the Portuguese arms contracts in the United Kingdom, and every endeavour has been made to find some way of satisfying Portugal&apos;s requirements. In view, however, of His Majesty&apos;s Government&apos;s own requirements, there are limits of concession beyond which it has been found impossible to go, and there is clearly a broad gap between those limits and the Portuguese minimum requirements.   It was therefore hoped that
the exchange of assurances referred to in (2) would bridge this gap. The proposal did not, however, meet with the approval of Dr. Salazar. Since then further proposals for the supply of certain guns, &amp;c, have been submitted to Dr. Salazar, but it seems more than doubtful whether they will prove acceptable.Decisions must therefore be reached on the following questions, which, for convenience, have been divided into two categories military and political.Military. 1. (A) Has the last word been said as regards our ability to supply arms to Portugal, or is there a possibility of any further concession ?(B) If it is impossible to make any further concessions and the contracts are placed in Germany or Italy, is it considered that the Mission has suffered to such an extent that it should be withdrawn? It might perhaps be observed in this connexion that Portugal has never previously placed the bulk of her military orders in this country. This fact has not hitherto been regarded as affording His Majesty&apos;s Government good grounds for complaint. It might therefore be argued that, in so far as it is owing to the present inability of the United Kingdom to ensure early deliveries to Portugal that she is placing orders elsewhere, there are less good grounds now for complaint than before.Moreover, before the instructions for the Mission were drawn up it was generally understood that it was not to be expected that the Mission would be able to secure the placing of large orders in the United Kingdom (see para-graph 6, Paper No. C.O.S. 623, and paragraph 12, Paper No. CCS. 625), and the subjects which the Mission might usefully investigate were carefully drawn up with reference to this condition.(C) A suggestion by Admiral Wodehouse in his memorandum referred to later that consideration should be given to the possibility of giving a promise of assistance by British air forces to Portugal under conditions. Admiral Wodehouse gives reasons for thinking that an undertaking of this nature might go far towards satisfying Portuguese requirements and lessening her fears.Political. 2. (A) If it is decided that the Mission need not be withdrawn as a result of the loss of the armaments contracts, should it be withdrawn for other reasons?(B) The line of action to be taken by the Mission if it remains in Portugal.As regards (A) differences of opinion have arisen, mostly on matter of minor importance, between the Mission and their Portuguese colleagues. These con-troversies have, moreover, tended to increase, and the position of the Mission in Sir W. Selby&apos;s view is now somewhat compromised. Admiral Wodehouse therefore returned to London in order to report on the present stage of the negotiations and give advice on the Mission&apos;s futui^e. There is in this connexion a certain divergence of opinion between Admiral Wodehouse and Sir W. Selby. The latter considers that, in view of the present apparent deadlock, unfortunate atmosphere, and the unlikelihood of reaching any spectacular results, it would be advisable for the Mission to complete certain investigations and then return to London and submit their report to His Majesty&apos;s Government. Sir W. Selby believes that any points left unsettled could be dealt with by himself and the Service Attaches (provided that these appointments are made without delay). If, however, it is decided that the Mission should remain there is further disagreement between Sir W. Selby and Admiral Wodehouse. They both agree that *the Mission can make little further progress on the present lines, but disagree on the solution. Sir W. Selby considers, as stated above, that the Mission should be wound up, whereas Admiral Wodehouse considers that it should remain on but that a different policy should be adopted in dealing with the Portuguese Government.Admiral Wodehouse&apos;s views are&apos; set&apos; out in a Memorandum* dated the 14th June, copy of which has been sent to the Committee of Imperial Defence. His recommendations are (a) That a decision should be arrived at as to the degree of importance attached by His Majesty&apos;s Government to the placing of the arms contract in this country. There is, as above stated, general agreement on the importance attached by His Majesty&apos;s Government to Jlie placing of these contracts in the United Kingdom. The only decision now to be taken in this respect is whether any further concessions can be made.(b) That, in the event of our being unable to agree to the supply of arms, steps should be taken to persuade Dr. Salazar that his requirements are not as
surgent as he thinks, and that pressure should be put on him to agree to His Majesty&apos;s Governments proposals. It will be remembered in this connexion that Dr. Salazar&apos;s main objection to the proposed exchange of assurances was that Portugal would thereby have to face the next few years virtually unarmed. Dr. Salazar left Sir W. Selby in no doubts as to his fears for the safety of his country during that period. Sir W. Selby subsequently endeavoured to persuade Dr. Salazar that his fears in this respect were exaggerated, but the latter remained unconvinced. The following is an extract from Sir W. Selby&apos;s report of his conversation with Dr. Salazar. Dr. Salazar said &quot;that the only danger for Portugal was a European convulsion and he was himself unable to exclude that possibility, and he must then bear in mind the Gennan influence on Spain. He repeated to me that the attitude of Portugal towards Spain remained friendly but suspicious. For the eventuality which he had in mind he could not agree that sea power alone would prevent the menace to Portugal. If Portugal was not ready to meet a sudden Spanish onslaught, Spain would dominate Portugal, and it was for this that he had to make certain preparations.&quot;Sir W. Selby&apos;s view, expressed in the same report, is that it is not as a result of any attempt to coerce Dr. Salazar that His Majesty&apos;s Government can hope to improve the British position in the Iberian Peninsula. He believes that our present methods are appreciated by Dr. Salazar, and that, within the limitations which he considers to be imposed upon him, he desires to take account of our wishes. The policy pursued hitherto has been to remain on good terms with him and not to press matters to a point which would lead to fresh misunderstandings such as arose in 1936 and 1937. The Committee of Imperial Defence are invited to consider whether this policy should be continued or abandoned in favour of a policy on the lines suggested by Admiral Wodehouse.If it is decided that a change should be made in our present policy in the direction of bringing pressure to bear upon Dr. Salazar in the expectation of this resulting in large orders being placed in this country, it would seem to follow that, whatever the position now reached by the Mission in regard to its programme of work, the Mission should remain in Lisbon until it becomes clear whether or not that expectation is to be fulfilled.If, on the other hand, no change is to be made in our present policy, a decision is required upon the date and manner of the withdrawal of the Mission. This question is examined in paragraphs 34 to 37 of Admiral Wodehouse&apos;s interim report* dated the 6th May. He there suggests that, as soon as he can foresee a date on which the whole or part of the Mission will have completed their work, he should inform the Ambassador and they should then discuss the manner and date of the withdrawal of either the whole or part of the Mission. The Ambassador, on the other hand, feels that, as soon as certain investigations now being made are completed, the Mission should return to London and submit their report to His Majesty&apos;s Government. Such information in regard to the Portuguese defence forces as is still required by the British Staffs could thereafter be obtained by Service Attaches. It is desirable that the Ambassador and Admiral Wodehouse should be told as soon as possible which of these alternative courses is favoured by His Majesty&apos;s Government.
Annex 1 to Enclosure. MAINTENANCE OF ANGLO-PORTUGUESE ALLIANCE.Memorandum by the Head of the British Military Mission to Portugal.THERE are certain questions relating to our position in Portugal, the answers to which will govern the policy to be pursued in Portugal and to a lesser degree the policy to be pursued by the British Military Mission. Only His Majesty&apos;s Government can provide the answers to these questions.2. Though in disagreement with his Excellency the Ambassador on one point, and that an important one, I have his full permission to state my views. The opinions expressed in this paper are my own personal opinions; but would, I know, be supported generally by all members of the British Military Mission.3. The point on which an immediate decision is required is as to what is the degree of importance attached by His Majesty&apos;s Government to the placing of the big arms contract.If it is considered on political and military grounds to be of the first importance that this contract should be placed in Great Britain, can anything be done either in the political or military field to bring this about?If the placing of the Arms contract other than in Great Britain is not of sufficient importance to justify modification of our present policy, the Ambassador and the Military Mission in Portugal should be so informed.The results of the Arms contract going to Germany seem to me to be that there would inevitably follow an increase of German influence through Portuguese missions visiting Germany, through German missions and. instructors visiting and remaining in Portugal, and possibly through the setting up of German munition factories in Portugal. A point arising out of this is whether, if the German influence grows, Dr. Salazar or his successor will be able to get rid of it when he wishes. There would be a decline in British prestige and perhaps an increase of the fear at the back of some Portuguese minds that Great Britain does not really intend to stand by the alliance. In a war in which Germany was hostile to Portugal, there would arise the difficulty of obtaining replenishment of the reserves of all sorts, and the difficulty, if Great Britain were Portugal&apos;s ally, of co-operating with an army which was differently armed and had no means of replacing losses of material. It would assist Germany financially and industrially by giving her a market for her surplus arms.On the other hand, if the threat to Portugal is urgent, the quickest way of removing PortugaFs present state of defencelessness is that she should buy as much as possible in Germany and/or Italy.4.   At present we are in a vicious circle : (a) Our inability to provide arms of the latest type quick enough to satisfywhat Dr. Salazar considers his urgent requirements and at a low enough price.(b) Our inability to persuade Dr. Salazar that his requirements are not asurgent as he thinks.(c) Our reluctance to press Dr. Salazar and put our side of the case franklyto him.In my opinion, a decision as to whether it is possible to do anything to break this vicious circle should be arrived at.5. Our reluctance to press Dr. Sulazar and put our side of the case frankly to him.1 have been in frequent consultation with his Excellency and he has given me clearly to understand that so long as his instructions remain what they are he is not in a position to press Dr. Salazar on any point, and before I left Lisbon he told me that, in his opinion, it would be unwise to attempt to do so.In my opinion, as a result of this policy, the British side of any question that arises cannot     adequately represented to Dr. Salazar.   It is not possible
to put forward explanations and arguments or to rebut arguments which Dr. Salazar may have used.From what I have heard on good authority, Dr. Salazar is a man who likes frankness. He is ignorant on technical matters and is badly informed. He has stated that he considers the Anglo-Portuguese alliance vital to Portugal, but he is peasant-born, has never to my knowledge been out of Portugal, was educated as an economist and later became Minister of Finance and, in my view, is therefore inclined to rate the financial side of a question too highly in relation to its technical and strategical side. On arms matters he is advised by the Under-Secretary for &quot;War, a man who is reported to be &quot;locked to Germany&quot; and is suspected by the army.Dr. Salazar is in a strong position at present in that he knows that in the matter of the Arms contract he can play off Great Britain, Germany and Italy against each other. He is the key to the whole situation, and I fancy there is only one thing which would shake his position in the country and that would be if it were to be thought that his policy might lead to the abandoning or even the weakening of the alliance.I appreciate that the Ambassador&apos;s instructions may be based on a higher policy of which I am ignorant, but it has occurred to me that since those instructions were issued, there bave been important changes in the situation outside and even inside Portugal, changes which may make it possible now to modify the instructions. I understood the Ambassador to say that, in his opinion, there is no half-way house between the present method of treatment of Dr. Salazar and the method of treatment which would lead to a row.In my opinion, if it be decided that it is not politic to press Dr. Salazar at present, it should be recognised that British prestige in Portugal will suffer and the Arms contract in whole or in part will be placed elsewhere than in Great Britain. Moreover, I think it would be unwise to make any more offers to Dr. Salazar.6. Our inability to persuade Dr. Salazar that his requirements are not as urgent as he thinks.Although Dr. Salazar has told the Ambassador that he does not fear an invasion from Spain, except as a result of a general conflagration, there is no doubt that fear of attack from Spain alone as soon as the Civil War is ended is present in varjdng degree in the minds of many, if not all, Portuguese.If His Majesty&apos;s Government have any secret information bearing on the threat from Spain or the general European situation which they are prepared to give to Dr. Salazar, or if any exchange of such information between the two Governments can be arranged, it might improve the chances of Dr. Salazar accepting Great Britain&apos;s arms offers.In this connection Dr. Salazar has said that the possession of material &quot; for instructional purposes and to arm his &apos; troupes de couvertures&apos; was absolutely vital to Portugal even if war was distant &quot; (his Excellency&apos;s despatch No. 109* of the 5th April). It may be, therefore, that Dr. Salazar has something else in mind, e.g., the necessity for providing some material immediately to keep alive the spirit he is trying to kindle in the army and the Portuguese people. If this is so, it might be possible to persuade Dr. Salazar that it was not absolutely essential to have the latest material which is being supplied to the British Arm)&apos;&apos;. I revert to this point in paragraph 7.7. Our inability to provide arms of the latest type quick enough to satisfy what Dr. Salazar considers his urgent requirements and at a loio enough price.As I understand it, the present position as regards the supply of arms to Portugal is that Dr. Salazar received coldly but promised to consider very carefully the offers contained in the Secretary of State&apos;s telegram No. 57 of the 18th May.Judging from previous experience, this will mean that after a suitable delay he will reject the offers, as indeed it appears to have been expected he would.There appear therefore to be two courses of action open to His Majesty&apos;s Government, either to accept the present situation and hope for the best or to try to find a means of continuing the negotiations.* Enclosure No. 1 to Annex to Paper No. D.P.K. &quot;267.
There can be little doubt that the best means would be for His Majesty&apos;s Government to make an offer to Dr. Salazar as regards dates of delivery of the latest material and payment as would be likely to satisfy him. I understand that it is unlikely that it may be found possible to make such an offer.An alternative would be to ask Dr. Salazar what offer would satisfy him both as regards dates of delivery and methods of payment. This would at least force Dr: Salazar to show his hand and might be tried first. It would be desirable to back it up with good arguments as to why Great Britain attaches (if she does) such importance to the Arms contract not being placed in Germany.A second alternative would be to offer to Dr. Salazar delivery at an early date of arms which though in the process of supersession are still in use in the British Army. Such an offer, if feasible, would almost certainly be opposed by the Under-Secretary for War and it would be necessary to make it sufficiently attractive both as regards dates of delivery and terms of payment as to overcome the inborn conceit, vanity and unpracticality of the Portuguese as a nation.8. Offer of assistance by British Air Forces.If either of these above alternatives could be accompanied by an offer of assistance by British Air Forces should Portugal become the theatre of operations in war they would have a much greater chance of success.I fully realise that such a proposal raises very wide issues, and may be without precedent. If, &quot;however, we attach sufficient importance to the retention for our use and the denial to the enemy of the use of Portuguese ports and air bases in war time, the proposal merits consideration.As a result of the conversations between the British and Portuguese mission, it is quite clear that the Portuguese not only hoped but expected that Great Britain would pledge herself to send troops to Portugal in the first phase of a war in which Portugal was attacked, but also that in return for the use of Lisbon, Great Britain would be prepared to pay, perhaps indirectly, part of the cost of the necessary defence of Lisbon. We know on good authority that when the Portuguese Mission interviewed Dr. Salazar before the arrival of the British Military Mission that they told him that this would be necessary. He replied that Portugal should pay, if possible, and the Mission came away from the inter-view feeling that Dr. Salazar had no idea of what the cost of the defence would be.The Portuguese are oppressed by the idea of a sudden attack by Spain either with or without the support of Germany. They feel, perhaps rightly in view of the relative populations of the two countries, that they could not stand up against such an attack, and that they would require immediate help from Great Britain. It has been pointed out to the Portuguese Mission that even in the hypothetical case of a localised war between Spain and Portugal it would not be physically possible for British troops to be in a position to withstand the first impact. They have accepted this with reluctance and disappointment.Though Dr. Salazar has expressed himself as satisfied with the Treaties as they stand, such is not the case with the Naval and Army representatives on the Portuguese Mission. It is of interest that none of them has ever mentioned the fact that a six months&apos; delay before assistance need be given is allowed for in paragraph 4 in the Treaty of Windsor, 1386, or that there is no specific mention of assistance by air in any of the Treaties. We have refrained up to date from making these two points, but it has occurred to us that the greatest aid Great Britain could render to Portugal would be by Air Force, that the promise of such help, should Portugal become the theatre of operations, would go some way to reassuring the. Portuguese and would give us some claim to insist on the construction of such air bases as we might require, and would possibly be of assistance in persuading the Portuguese to buy the same types of aircraft as were in use in the British Air Forces.The disadvantages and risks of such an offer are not as real as might appear at first sight.If we are correct in saying that there is no fear of such an attack, there will never be occasion to implement the promise; if, on the other hand, the Portuguese are correct and such an attack did take place, we should, in my opinion, have to send help to Portugal in any case, first to give the Portuguese some moral stiffening, secondly to show Spain that we mean business, and thirdly to avoid the possibility of losing the use of Lisbon, or, alternatively, having to recapture it.
If this assumption is correct, as I believe it is, it would be just as well to make the promise gracefully now as to have to send the Air Forces in war time without the compensating advantage of getting something beforehand from the Portuguese in return.It is therefore suggested that this matter should be considered.9. Recommendations.(A) That a decision should be arrived at as to what is the degree of importance attached by His Majesty&quot;s Government to the placing of the Arms contract (paragraph 3).(B) That a decision should be arrived at as to whether anything can be done to break the vicious circle in which we now find ourselves as regards (a) supply of arms (paragraph 7), (&amp;) our inability to persuade Dr. Salazar that his require-ments are not as urgent as he thinks (paragraph 6), (c) our reluctance to press Dr. Salazar and put our side of the case frankly to him (paragraph 5).(C) That consideration should be given to the possibility of giving a promise of assistance by British Air Forces under certain conditions (paragraph 8).(Signed) N. A. WODEHOUSE, Rear-Admiral,Head of British Military Mission.June 14, 1938.Annex 2 to Enclosure. Interim Report on the Work of the British Military Mission in Portugal.Rear-Admiral Wodehouse to Sir W. Selby.-(Secret.)Your Excellency, Lisbon, May 6, 1938.IN accordance &quot;with my instructions from the Foreign Secretary, I have the honour to forward the following report on the present state of the work of the British Military Mission in Portugal: 2. My instructions from the Foreign Secretary stated that an interim report on the progress of the mission would be required four to six weeks after the arrival of the mission in Portugal. On the 31st March I mentioned to your Excellency that, though I had been engaged on this interim report, I was of opinion that the progress and future of the mission would depend so much on the terms of the notes which His Majesty&apos;s Government were then proposing to exchange with the Portuguese Government that I had come to the conclusion that an interim report at that stage would have no value. You concurred that no interim report should be sent at that time. I had intended to submit a draft telegram to the Foreign Office on this question for your approval, but regret that in the hurry of packing up for our trip to the north I overlooked it.3. The affairs of the mission have, however, now arrived at such a stage that I am of opinion that a report would not only be of value, but is also necessary.4. In order to obtain a true idea of the situation as it has presented itself to me during our stay in Portugal, it is necessary that I should review the situation as it has unfolded itself since our arrival.The Situation up to the Present Date.5. The mission arrived on the 20th February. On the 21st February a meeting was held at the Embassy, at which the members of the British Military Mission and the Embassy staff were present. Your Excellency gave a short account of the existing situation. From this I understood that at a recent interview Dr. Salazar had given you the impression that no further action would be taken as.regards foreign contracts until the mission had reported; that you &quot;were impressed by the seriousness of the German propaganda and considered
that, if the arms contract went to Germany, the resultant infiltration of the German officers as instructors might have decisive effects in the future. I also-understood that it was the unanimous opinion of your Excellency and your staff that it would be a great mistake to try to coerce Dr. Salazar, and that anything in the form of a threat would be fatal. At the same time, I understood that there was no chance that any contract would be completed without our being aware of the fact and that the British Mission could afford to go slow.6. Further, I understood that, though Dr. Salazar was in a position to carry out whatever policy he decided upon, he was at that time &quot;&quot;balancing.&quot; and had not in fact made up his mind as to whether the interests of Portugal would best be served by an adherence to the Anglo-Portuguese Alliance or by aligning himself with Germany and Italy. There seemed to me to be this fundamental difference between the position of Dr. Salazar as I had understood it in London and as I understood it after your talk. In London I had understood that Dr. Salazar was whole-heartedly in favour of the alliance, but that he might not be in a position to carry through the policy he wished; from your talk, on the other hand, I understood that Dr. Salazar could carry through any policy he wished, but that he had not yet made up his mind what policy he would adopt. It appeared to me that until we were certain which way Dr. Salazar intended to* go it would be unwise for the British Military Mission to get to a stage with the Portuguese at which it became necessary to divulge to them secrets which might ultimately be made use of against us. For this reason, therefore, and also because I considered at that date that time was on our side in the matter of Great Britain&apos;s ability to supply arms to Portugal, it seemed to me that a policy of going slow was the right one for the mission to adopt, and that our immediate object should be to cultivate good relations with the Portuguese Mission and to seize any opportunity that might occur for preventing the arms contract from going to Germany and/or Italy.7. On the 24th February we held our first conference with the Portuguese Mission. The atmosphere of suspicion on the part of the Portuguese, of which we had been warned, immediately became apparent. When I suggested that we should consider first the defence of Lisbon, the general excitedly interrupted me and said we could not consider the defence of Lisbon without considering the defence of Portugal as a whole. As a means of easing the tension I suggested that at our next meeting the general should give us a lecture on the defence problems of Portugal. To this he agreed and we parted in an atmosphere of cordiality.8. The Mardi Gras holidays then intervened, and on the 2nd March we held our second conference with the Portuguese Mission. The general then gave a general survey of the strategical position of Portugal as he saw it. The impression I gained was that his main object was to impress us with the importance and the weakness of Portugal. Subsequent lectures from the general occupied the period from the 2nd March to the 29th March. These lectures dealt mainly with the topographical features of Portugal from a strategic point of view. Though of importance to the army representatives on the mission, they were of little value to the air representatives and of still less value to me. The professorial and verbose methods of the general made these lectures very wearisome and caused them to occupy time that might well have been better employed. Though the relations between the two missions at this time were very cordial, any attempts on my part to speed up the procedure tended at once to break up this atmosphere of cordiality. I saw no reason, therefore, during this period to change my decision that the policy of the mission should be to go slow, and as events proved, the time was by no means wasted.9. During this period the relationship between the two missions improved as time went on and there occurred an incident that made it appear that we might obtain all and more than we had come out for. On Saturday, the 12th March, and Tuesday, the 15th March, I had two conversations with the general, in the course of which he delivered two messages from the Under-Secretary for War. The gist of these was that if an exchange of notes could be arranged between the two Governments, all arms contracts, other than those for rifles and light machine guns, which had already been placed, would go to Great Britain. I told the general that he and I were getting on to a political sphere, and that it would be better that I should report the matter to your Excellency. He agreed and I reported this conversation in full to your Excellency, and it
subsequently formed the basis of your telegrams* Nbs. 36 and 38 on the subject of an exchange of notes.10. Though we knew that His Majesty&apos;s Government was urgently considering the question of an exchange of notes, it was not until the 29th March that the reply was received, and in view of the immediate change in the situation which would arise if such an exchange of notes could be arranged, I was not in the least anxious as regards the passage of time without our making very much apparent progress.11. On the 30th March your Excellency invited the members of the mission to the Embassy to discuss the notes which His Majesty&apos;s Government proposed should be exchanged. I gained the impression at this meeting that no one there present had any doubt but that the Under-Secretary&apos;s messages to me through the general had been inspired by Dr. Salazar and that there would be no difficulty as regards Dr. Salazar accepting an exchange of notes.12. On the 31st March the two missions left for a tour of the north. Though the primary object of this tour was to enable the general to explain to the army representatives the topographical and strategical features of the north of Portugal, it had become evident to me that the Portuguese Mission was anxious also to impress us with the beauty and potentialities of Portugal and with the developments which had already taken place under Dr. Salazar. This tour and the Holy Week Holidays occupied the period of the 31st March to the 18th April.13. I arrived back in Lisbon on the 13th April when you told me that Dr. Salazar had refused the exchange of notes. Since that date your Excellency&apos; has had a second interview with Dr. Salazar with the same result. The exchange of notes, therefore, though the proposal originated from the Portuguese, has proved abortive.14. It seems to me that the following results have, however, been achieved : (a) Dr. Salazar appears to have shown quite definitely that his policy&apos; is to stand by the Anglo-Portuguese Alliance.This removes the doubt I originally had in my mind as to the wisdom of the mission proceeding too far in their talks with the Portuguese Mission.(&amp;) An assurance has been received that Dr. Salazar will not place any arms contracts, with the exception of the Breda heavyr machine gun in Italy, until you had heard again from His Majesty&apos;s Government.15. Since our meeting on the 21st February the terms of the Anglo-Italian accord have been published and the effect of this agreement may alter the view which has previously been held as regards arms contracts going to Italy.16. The problem now, therefore, as regards the arms contracts, seems to be to prevent as large a proportion as possible of those contracts going to Germany, but in view of (a) above, the doubt as to where the contracts will be placed need not restrict the work of the missions.17. In the meantime the work of the mission has been proceeding within our terms of reference. On our return from the north the general agreed with my suggestion that the mission should now split up and that each service should consider their own problems independently. The general &apos; suggested that to expedite the work we should meet twice a day. I said I was unable to agree to this suggestion. My reasons for this are given in nry letter of the 4th May to the general, which is attached as an appendix to this report.^) Our relationships now are such that I am in a position to adopt the tone used in this letter, a tone which would have led to the break-up of the missions a few weeks ago. At the time of writing I have received no reply.Interpreti?ig.18. From the start it was apparent that the question of interpreting would prove difficult. The Portuguese, however,, made it quite clear that they could not consider the question of anyrone other than a service representative being present at discussions on secret defence matters; that they were satisfied that their inter-preters were efficient and that it was their opinion that interpreting would present no difficulties. This point was one of two mentioned by Dr. Salazar at tlx interview your Excellency and I had with him on the 21st February.* Appendices 1 and 3 to Enclosure to Paper No. D.P.E. 259. (&apos;) Not printed.
19. By the 20th.March it was becoming apparent that through faultyinter-pretation the work of the mission would be delayed, and that there would he danger of mistakes possibly serious ones-being made. Accordingly, on the 22nd March, I wrote a polite note to the general asking if he could make any suggestions on this question. I received no reply, but heard afterwards that my letter to him, which merely asked for suggestions, had led to an explosion on the part of the general at a meeting of the Portuguese Mission, at which the general had said that he was the chief of the mission and that he would not be dictated to by anyone. I therefore decided that it was not opportune at that time to pursue the subject further.20. By the 20th April the knowledge of Portuguese possessed by some members of the mission was sufficient to enable them to detect and point out serious errors in interpreting, so much so that there would be risks of mistakes and misunder-standing on important matters. It had also become apparent that the general himself had appreciated that his interpreter was not up to the work.21. Accordingly on the 4th May I wrote to the general the letter mentioned in paragraph 17 above, a copy of which is attached as an appendix.^) I have not yet received a reply.Present State of Progress of the Work of the Mission.(a) Navy.: 22. My talks with the naval representative have now reached the following stage : At his invitation, I forwarded to him on the 3rd May a paper setting out in some detail &apos;&apos; what Great Britain requires of Portugal on the naval side in the event of their co-operating as allies in the event of war.&quot; I have asked him to let me have a similar paper from the Portuguese side, and this he has promised to do in a few days. I hope, by discussing these two papers together, we shall be able to arrive at conclusions which will then have to be discussed and agreed upon at a combined meeting of the two missions. This should conclude the discussions on the naval side of section II and section II, paragraph (4), of the draft schedule forwarded by the Foreign Office to the Portuguese Ambassador in London on the 22nd February, 1938.23. The subjects mentioned in (1), (2) and (3) of the same draft schedule have already been discussed, and should cause little difficulty; those in para-graph (7) have not yet been touched on.24. I think it may be said, therefore, that the progress made has been good, and there seems to be a reasonable prospect of achieving the purpose of the mission from the naval side.Future Procedure.25. I think it will be necessary for me to visit the Algarve and the harbour works which are under construction on the south coast of Portugal. I do not propose to do this, however, until my discussions with the naval representative on the two papers mentioned above have reached a more advanced stage.26. It has also been suggested that the mission should visit the Azores. I am not yet in a position to say as to whether this will be necessary or desirable.(b) Army. ;&apos;27. Colonel Daly reports that his conversations with General Cabral have been confined to paragraphs 1, 2, 3 and 6 of Dr. Monteiro&apos;s first draft proposals, dated the 16th December, and to a general study of the Portuguese defence problems. Owing to the generaFs lack of method, love of oratory and evasiveness, progress has been slow, and is likely to remain so.28. It is being found difficult to persuade General Cabral to discuss the question of the security of Lisbon as a naval base, from land or air attack, without the introduction by him of-the co-operation of British land forces in its defence, a subject which should be considered hypothetically under paragraph 7 of Dr. Monteiro&apos;s draft proposals... 29. Colonel Daly further reports that he is continuing to obtain useful military information. Given time, he considers that the objects as set out in the terms of reference may be achieved.(&apos;) Not printed.
30. In order to satisfy the Portuguese it will be necessary for him to visit the remaining theatres of operations in Portugal. This of itself will take up considerable time.(c) A ir. &apos;31. Group Captain Field reports that a certain amount of useful exploratory work has been carried out with reference to paragraph 5 of section II of Dr. Monteiro&apos;s letter, regarding air bases. A difficulty is presented by the fact that the air members of the Portuguese Mission appear to agree with everything which is said from the British side, but thereafter adopt a &quot; non-possumus &quot; attitude on the ground that the authorities in their parent services are completely lacking in air-mindedness.32. Thus, a suggestion as to the necessity for organising an observer system was agreed to whole-heartedly, but a request for a map giving the main tele-graphic and telephonic trunk lines and general organisation of communications has as yet produced no result.33. As regards paragraphs 2 and 3 of section I of the same letter, there appears to be either a reluctance to employ the mission in these matters, or else the national inertia has prevented a departure from the older procedure. Two enquiries have come to the notice of the British Mission, but not, apparently, to that of the Portuguese Mission.Withdrawal of the Mission.34. A decision on the date and manner of the withdrawal of the mission appear to depend on two factors :- (a) Completion of the work.(b) The effect on official and public opinion in Portugal.35. As regards (a), it would, in my opinion, be a great mistake for the mission to be withdrawn until we had satisfied the Portuguese that we had got as far as it was possible to get within our terms of reference. I am unable to forecast the date on which this will be achieved either on the naval, air or army-side. It is, however, clear that to satisfy the Portuguese on the army side considerably more time will be required than on the naval side, while the air side of the mission must be dependent on the work of the naval and army representatives. When the situation as regards the progress of work is clearer, it will be necessary to discuss .the manner in which the mission should be withdrawn, that is, whether the naval and /or air representatives can be withdrawn, leaving the army representatives to continue their discussions or what procedure should be adopted.36. As regards (b), that is, the effect on public opinion in Portugal, I am unable to express an opinion, but I do feel that it is important that when I leave I should be able to state publicly that the mission have achieved, or are well on the way to achieve, the objects for which the British Military Mission came out.37. I would therefore suggest that, as soon as I can foresee a date on which the whole or part of the mission will have completed their work, I should inform you, and we should then discuss the question of the manner and date of the withdrawal of either the whole or part of the mission.I have, &amp;c.N.

Printed for the Committee of Imperial Defence.   June 1938.SECRET.COMMITTEE  OF  IMPERIAL  DEFENCE.Extract from the DRAFT Minutes of the %2&amp;th Meeting, held on June 30, 1938.&quot;h&quot; ^ $fc the 4^ -jt(3)-BRITISH MILITARY MISSION TO PORTUGAL. (C.I.D. Paper No. 1440-B.) (Previous reference: C.I.D. Minutes of the 322nd Meeting, Minute 8.)THE COMMITTEE had under consideration a Memorandum by the Foreign Office covering a Memorandum by the head of the British Military Mission to Portugal and an interim report on the work of the Mission. (C.I.D. Paper No. 1440-B.)LORD HADIFAX said that the Foreign Office Memorandum revealed certain differences of opinion between the head of the Mission and our Ambassador in Lisbon. These differences had their origin from, and revolved around, the question of the supply of arms to Portugal which, as the Committee was fully aware, had been the subject of earnest consideration during the past few months. Admiral Wodehouse took the view that the supply of arms to Portugal by this country was of great importance, and that the time had now come to put some form of pressure on Dr. Salazar. Sir Walford Selby, on the other hand, held the view that we should be content with methods of persuasion. It was clear that Dr. Salazar for reasons with which we did not agree was determined to re-arm Portugal as soon as possible. In the Ambassadors view, therefore, it seemed that if we were, in any case, to lose the arms contract, it would be, to say the least of it, unfortunate if by our method of approach to Dr. Salazar we were to lose his goodwill as well. If, on the other hand, our relations remained on a cordial footing, there was always the possibility that we might come into the market on some future date, when we were in a better position to release supplies of armaments to Portugal. The Foreign Office were in general agreement with the view held by Sir Walford Selby.SIR KINGSLEY WOOD suggested that Dr. Salazar&apos;s attitude was not unreasonable, in view of the state of the world at the present time.LORD HALIFAX agreed. It was difficult, however, to appreciate Dr. Salazar&apos;s apprehensions. He had, after all, the Anglo-Portuguese Alliance, by the terms of which any country attacking Portugal would, ipso facto, be opposed by the resources of Great Britain and, in particular, by the British Fleet.Mr. DUFF COOPER remarked that Dr. Salazar was particularly appre-hensive of land attack from Spain.LORD HALIFAX said that, in that event, we could make it far more uncomfortable for Spain than Spain covild for Portugal.SIR MAURICE HANKEY suggested a further point in this connection. Dr. Salazar&apos;s fear was that if Spain attacked Portugal, it was probable that she w&apos;ould do so with the backing of Germany. If Portugal was armed with German weapons, Germany would be in a position to stop the execution of the order, if it was still incomplete, and to cut off immediately all further supplies of arms,[17482-2]Copy Ho.
ammunition and spare parts as soon as war with Spain broke out. Portugal would then be completely at the mercy of the country which, by hypothesis, was egging on Spain against her.LORD GORT, in reply to a question by Sir Thomas Inskip, said that no further concessions could be made to Portugal in the matter of the supply df guns.SIR THOMAS INSKIP said that there seemed general agreement that a policy of persuasion, as opposed to a policy of coercion, should be adopted in oar future dealings with Dr. Salazar.LORD HALIFAX said that the next point to be decided was the future of the Military Mission. His own impression was. that the Mission had got as far as it was likely to get, and that, when the work actually in hand had been completed, it should return to this country and render its report. Any unfor-tunafe reactions that might result from their departure could be reduced by the immediate appointment to Lisbon of an attache from each Service Department to &quot; keep the door open.&quot;SIR KINGSLEY WOOD enquired whether the Mission had explained to the Portuguese authorities the manner and extent of the assistance which we should afford to them in time of war.Mr. DUFF COOPER said that it appeared that the discussions had taken the form of a series of lectures by the head of the Portuguese Mission, explaining at great length Portuguese strategical problems. The subsequent discussions had always turned on what assistance we were prejmred to give. Unfortunately the Mission had not been in a position to make any very concrete offers, either as to the despatch of military forces or with regard to the delivery of armaments. If there was still a hope that the Mission would prove a success, there seemed grounds for retaining it in Portugal; if not, it should return.LORD CHATFIELD said that as a result of a conversation which he had had with Admiral Wodehouse he had not gained the impression that the head of the Mission favoured downright coercive methods. Admiral Wodehouse&apos;s point had been that under his present instructions the Ambassador was restricted to some extent even as to the persuasive arguments which he could employ. For instance, it had not been fully explained to Dr. Salazar why his fears were exaggerated, or the risk of his supplies of German-made arms and ammunition being cut off in time of war.SIR THOMAS INSKIP suggested that the Foreign Office might sound the Ambassador as to whether he was satisfied that all the arguments which had a bearing on the problem had been put to Dr. Salazar.SIR JOHN SIMON enquired whether any guarantee of assistance by air forces, as suggested by Admiral Wodehouse, could be given to the Portuguese.SIR CYRIL NEW ALL said that any assurance of this nature would be in the form of a &quot;contingent commitment.&quot; Our ability to implement any such assurance would necessarily depend on the general situation when wtar broke out.LORD GORT expressed a strong disinclination to enter into any commitment to send direct help by army or air forces to Portugal. The impression in the War Office was that the Mission was in danger of out-staying its welcome.SIR THOMAS INSKIP considered that the Mission had done its best in the circumstances, and should certainly not be regarded as a failure. They had had to make bricks without straw, and&apos;the difficulties with which they would be faced had been clearly appreciated before they had left this country.SIR JOHN SIMON considered that the Mission had done useful work and gathered valuable information. Dr. Salazar was in the comfortable position of being able to play off one country against another.SIR MAURICE HANKEY suggested, and the Committee agreed, that Dr. Salazar might be encouraged to place armament orders in Italy, with whom our relations had recently improved, rather than in Germany.
. &apos;      - .-; Conclusions. ,,v, &apos;The Committee of Imperial Defence agreed : (a) That no further concessions with regard to the supply of armaments to Portugal, over and above those already approved by the Cabiriet*6bulci -  -      be recommended.        ir- &quot;    ;    , &apos;(p) That in any further negotiations on the subject of Portuguese, armament orders, nothing should be said which might tend to alienate Dr. Salazar&apos;s goodwill towards us.(c) That if Portugal cannot wait for British armaments, it would be preferable from an international point of view that she should place her orders with Italy rather than Germany, and that she should be encouraged to do so.(d) To invite the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to satisfy himself that every possible argument has been used to convince Dr. Salazar of the improbability of any attack on Portugal and of the over-whelming support which he would receive as the result of the Anglo-Portuguese Alliance, particularly by virtue of British sea power; and to explain the unenviable position in which he would find himself if, having re-armed with German weapons he were to be attacked by a German-supported Spain.(e) That subject to obtaining satisfaction on the above points, nothing-further was to be gained by the Mission remaining in Portugal, and that the Ambassador at Lisbon should be instructed to consult with the head of the Mission and advise as to the date of the Mission&apos;s departure.(/) That it is important that Attaches from the three Service Departments should be appointed to Lisbon before the Mission leave, in order to deal with any outstanding points.(g) To record their appreciation of the work of the Mission in the face ofadverse circumstances. &apos;(h) To invite the Secretary of State to communicate the sense of the above conclusions to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Lisbon.(i) That C.I.D. Paper No. 1440-B together with the above minutes of thediscussion should- be submitted to the Cabinet.^ ^ ^? ^ 4&amp; sk&quot;2 Whitehall Gardens, S.
