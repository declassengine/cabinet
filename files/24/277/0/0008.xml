Printed for the Cabinet.   May 1938.SECRET. Copy No..CP. 127 (38).CABINET.BRITISH INFLUENCE IN CENTRAL AND SOUTH-eastern europe.Memorandum by Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.AS a result of the recent absorption of Austria by Germany, German influence over the whole of Central and South-Eastern Europe, which was already formidable, now extends and seems likely to extend in a manner and to a degree that has not been witnessed since 1917.2. In these circumstances, what should be the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government ? Are we prepared to stand by and allow these vast districts to pass completely under German domination? Such domination does not necessarily mean an extension of German territorial sovereignty; it does, however, mean an intensification of German economic and commercial influence, which in its turn means an extension of political dominance. This process, if it were allowed to proceed unchecked, would mean that Central and South-Eastern Europe would tend to become to Germany what, in many respects and with some obvious reservations, the Dominions are to the United Kingdom. One of the main differences would perhaps be to the advantage of Germany, namely, that the area concerned would be.a geographically compact one. The situation, indeed, would not be far removed from that obtaining in 1917, when Germany could go and come and to a certain extent do as she pleased in this area with this all-important difference, that then she was faced with a hostile Italy, whereas now the utmost which in the immediate future we can hope for is a neutral Italy.3.   Some of the most important results would be as follows : (a) A great spread of German cultural influence. The position of German as the lingua franca of these districts would be greatly strengthened. The youth of these districts would tend to be educated in Germany. Cultural influence in its turn is a powerful adjunct to political pressure.(&amp;) A strengthening of Germany&apos;s potential reservoir of raw materials, particularly food-stuffs, minerals and oils.(c) The extension of markets for her manufactured goods, which would, ofcourse, correspondingly strengthen her economy as a whole. A table is attached which shows the position occupied by Greater Germany (Germany and Austria together), as compared with Germany alone, in the trade of seven Central and South-Eastern European countries in 1937.(d) The dominance by Germany of the communications system in Central andSouth-Eastern Europe. The possession of Vienna and her paramount influence in Budapest, will mean that she will have at her command the centre of the railroad communications and will dominate the Danube (particularly if the Danube-Main-Rhine canal is completed in the near future).(e) A general accretion of strength and prestige and the virtual certainty that in the event of war some, if not all, of these countries will be dragged in Germany&apos;s wake.9887   [17280]   .
4. Given the geographical position of Greater Germany and the economic framework of Central Europe, some of the results listed above are in any case unavoidable and inevitable. A proportion of them cannot be prevented whatever action His Majesty&apos;s Government or the French Government might be prepared to take, short of war. On the other hand, not all of these results are inevitable, and it is suggested that efforts should be made without delay to counteract them.5. It has always been the traditional policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government to prevent one Power attaining a predominant position on the Continent. It is true that conditions change and that England no longer stands in exactly the same relationship to Europe as she&quot; did either in the 18th or 19th centuries. Nevertheless, i.t will no doubt be generally conceded that it remains very much to her interest indeed, it will be argued in some quarters that it is vital to her interests that Germany should not attain a virtual hegemony in Europe. It is, perhaps, all the more important to avoid this since it seems not impossible that the Western Powers will eventually be ready to concede to Germany in one form or another some colonial territory. In other words, we may look forward to a time when Germany will once again be a colonial Power, in which case her predominance in Europe would be even more dangerous to us than if she were still to be deprived of any colonial territory. The danger will be even greater if, as seems probable, General Franco wins the civil war and if, as a result, Germany&apos;s influence in the Peninsula were to become consolidated. A Germany predominant in Central and South-Eastern Europe, occupying a dominant position in Spain, and possessing colonial territory, would constitute a direct menace to the security of the British Commonwealth.6. An effort on the part of His Majesty&apos;s Government to counteract Germany&apos;s advance, political and economic, in Central and South-Eastern Europe, seems therefore highly desirable, if indeed it is not considered vital to our interests.7. That the situation is not hopeless is shown by the fact that we have already managed, so we hope, to prevent one Power at least in this part of Europe from falling under German influence. This Power is Turkey, and the success we have had in this direction leads us to hope that it may not be impossible to take similar action in respect of other minor European States. Even where it is not possible to prevent German influence playing a very large part, it might be all-important to convince the countries concerned that they are not completely abandoned by the Western Powers and that the latter still offer them a loophole of resistance to the German stranglehold which they dread. The degree of priority to be attached to our efforts in these countries is subject to political considerations and the means whereby we could in fact further our interests are briefly examined below. In the meantime, it should be pointed out that our object is not, and should not have the appearance of being, designed to create an anti-German bloc. Such a bloc could in reality only be organised if this country and perhaps France were ready to grant military guarantees, which clearly they are not. Our, object should rather be to endeavour to ensure that this area of Europe shall look specifically for leadership to this country, and generally towards the Western Powers, rather than feel obliged in default of any other point cVappui to allow itself to be exploited by Berlin.8,. The means which are open to us to promote our influence in Central and South-Eastern Europe, and particularly in the Balkan area, can be divided into three classes :  .    &apos;(a) Diplomatic;(6) Cultural;(c) Economic.All these means are subservient, for the purposes of this memorandum, to our general political aims. ,.     . -&apos;.9. It is noteworthy that since the absorption of Austria by Germany we have received indications from a number of countries that they would be grateful if a greater interest in them could be taken by His Majesty&apos;s Government, and it is clear that they are, in varying degrees, all experiencing apprehension at the approach of the German colossus. Specific indications of this kind have been -received from Pnnmania, Yugoslavia, Greece and Bulgaria.  Moreover, it can be
confidently assumed that all the countries in Central and South-Eastern Europe would welcome any measure of economic assistance which would prevent them from being completely subservient to the German market, provided always that the adoption of these measures does not entail German hostility. It seems, therefore, that there is no time to lose and that we should strike while the iron is hot. If we do not, it is virtually certain that these countries will lose heart and be prepared to make the best terms they can with Germany.10. The promotion of our cultural influence in Central and South-Eastern Europe, as elsewhere, is in the hands of the British Council, and the work has lately been intensified with encouraging results.11. On the economic side, however, the position is much less satisfactory. Our economic relations with the countries in Central and South-Eastern Europe are administered from this end by various Departments, namely, the Treasury, Board of Trade, Export Credits Guarantee Department and Department of Overseas Trade. The Foreign Office interests are primarily political, whereas those of the other Departments concerned are wholly economic or commercial. While the Foreign Office tend to regard economics and finance as a means to a political end, the other Departments are naturally bound to judge these from a different point of view. A deadlock is apt to be reached by a political &quot; desideratum &quot; being brought to nothing by a technical &quot; non possumus.&quot; This may often be right. Nevertheless, we are constantly told that our most powerful weapon in the international sphere resides in economics and finance. In the present critical state of Europe it seems more than ever necessary that effective use should be made of this weapon, particularly in Central and South-Eastern Europe. Yet no special machinery exists whereby the political and economic aspects of the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the countries under review can be properly co-ordinated, with a view to ensuring that the maximum political advantage be extracted from the economic weapon.12. It will be recalled that at the meeting between British and French Ministers on the 28th and 29th April last, the problem of Central Europe, with special reference to the possibility of economic assistance to Czechoslovakia, Roumania and Yugoslavia, was discussed, and it was agreed that both countries should do all they could to increase their trade with Central and South-Eastern European States, and that the questions at issue should be further discussed in detail by experts. No such further discussion has in fact taken place, although the French Government have recently sent us a memorandum containing a scheme based on the comptoir system which, it is understood, does not appeal to the Treasury. The Board of Trade have, however, instituted a detailed enquiry into the possibility of the United Kingdom increasing her imports from the countries in question, but the results of that enquiry are not yet available.13. In these circumstances, it is suggested that what is desirable is the creation of some machinery to co-ordinate the efforts of His MajestyJs Government to promote our political influence in South-Eastern Europe by economic measures. This, it seems, might best be done by the setting up of an Inter-Departmental Committee whose task it would be to examine both the requests we have received from the countries themselves for economic assistance and the results of the Board of Trade enquiry, and to make available to the Foreign Policy Committee of the Cabinet full material for judgment upon the political, as well as upon the economic, implications of any action that seemed possible. As speed seems to, be of the utmost importance, I should hope that steps might be taken in this sense with the least possible delay.Such an Inter-Departmental Committee should obviously contain represen-tatives of the Foreign Office, Treasury, Board of Trade, Export Credits Guarantee Department and Department of Overseas Trade, with power to co-opt represen-tatives from other Departments and to invite the assistance of private interests .as required.H.Foreign Office, May 24, 1938.
