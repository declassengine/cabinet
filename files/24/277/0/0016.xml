(THIS    DOCUMENT    IS    THE   PROPERTY    OF HIS    BBIIAHifIC    M A J E S T Y&apos;S    GOVERNMENT) .SECRET. COPY   NO.   . . jft. . . . .CP.155(38) .CABINET.PROVISION    of   FACILITIES    for SPORT    in the    CIVIL   SERVICE.Memorandum by the Minister of Health.1.     With the concurrence of the Prime Minister and the Chancellor of the Exchequer I submit for approval a proposal, which was to have been brought forward by my predecessor, that an annual grant should be made in respect of sport and recreational facilities in the Civil Service.     The sum proposed is   0,000 a year.      The question of a capital grant does not arise at this juncture though it is obviously an essential element in any large-scale sports movement.3.     parliament is responsible as &quot;employer&quot; for four Crown Services;    the Navy, the Army, the Air Force and the Civil Service.      So far, however, as the Civil Service is concerned there is no 11 employer&apos; s&quot; aid;    the whole cost of any facilities for sport and recreation is met by the &quot;employees&quot; themselves.     The position of parliament as a large employer of labour thus compares unfavourably with that of the better employers generally.     Extensive provision for recreational facilities in the form of outdoor and indoor sport is commonly made by outside bodies of standing.      In many cases sports grounds are provided without expense to their employees by commercial employers who also contribute towards the maintenance and running expenses.      It seems indefensible that, as regards a very large section of its own employees, Parliament should do nothing.1.
3,      At &quot;the present time,   there are some 550,000 Civil Servants.      Of these,  some 175,000 are industrial workers,  e.g, at the Royal Dockyards,  Ordnance Factories,  etc.,  some 200,000 manipulative staffs, postmen, sorters and the like;  some 20,000 messengers,  etc., and some 55,000 subordinate office staffs (largely women), -e.g. clerical assistants, typists. These total 450,000.      The balance of 100,000 comprise administrative, executive, clerical, professional, and analogous staffs,      Thus, of the total Civil Service,  over 80$ are what in outside industry would be regarded as typical working class elements, the wages of the vast majority of whom are less than  4 per week,  so that the section of the Service which would mainly benefit from the measures proposed is the &quot;little man&quot;.4.      The Civil Service Sports Council, a voluntary organisation of Civil Servants, has succeeded with great difficulty in making grounds available at the following centres, vis. Birmingham, Bristol, Cardiff,  Chatham, Chiswick, Darlington, Manchester, Newport, Horthallerton, Plymouth, Portsmouth,  St. Helens, Southampton and Warrington.      Even so, the facilities are inadequate;    many provincial centres have no grounds at all,  and for London with its great distances and large numbers there is only one ground for the general needs of the Service.5.      The present position is that capital expenditure of approximately  70,000 has been incurred out of borrowed moneys and that towards the service of this sum and current maintenan and management an income of between  7,000 and  8,000 a year, which is raised by subscriptions of Id. per week,  is available6,      The adequate maintenance of even the present facilities apart altogether from urgently needed extension and the service of the capital raised cannot, however, be met from the present income,  and unless the whole movement can be put on a firmer footing it will have to be wound up.
7.     The present proposals have &quot;been carefully examined by the Treasury authorities and in their opinion and in mine represent a contribution towards the welfare of the S&quot;oate&apos;s employees which is more than justified.      Important commercial firms, indeed, spend very much larger sums on the recreation and welfare of their employees.      I accordingly ask for authority to make a statement at Question time.     The money will be borne on the Ministry of Health vote,  and a supplementary Estimate will be necessary.W.  E.  E.June 17th, 1938.
