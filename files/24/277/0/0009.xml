LgCRET. CABINET. COPY NO.   3 Cf-128(38).REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON HOLIDAYS WITH PAY. Memorandum fry the Minister of Labour.1.     In accordance with Cabinet Conclusion 21(38)8, I announced in &quot;the House of Commons on 28th April that the Report of the Committee on Holidays with Pay would be studied sympathetically and that I hoped to make a statement on the subject in due course.     Also, in accordance with those conclusions, the Report has now been considered by a conference of representatives of the Government Departments concerned.2.     As I explained in Cabinet Paper 98(38) the Committee proposed early legislation:-(i) giving power to Trade Boards, Agricultural Wages Committees, and other statutory bodies for regulating wages, to provide for holidays with pay;(ii) entitling workers in domestic service to two weeks&apos; annual holiday with ps-y;(iii) to enable the Exchequer to bear the cost of administering special holiday schemes for industries with intermittent employment.With the concurrence of my colleagues, the Secretary of State for Scotland and the Minister of Agriculture, I recommend that the proposal with regard to (i) above be accepted in principle, subject to discussion of certain points of detail with representatives of employers and trade unions.With regard to (ii) above, I see no reason why we should anticipate for one particular class of worker any legislation which may eventually be introduced, providing generally for holidays with pay, and I recommend that the proposal for early legislation should not be accepted but that domestic workers should be dealt with if and when general legislation is introduced at a later date, as recommended by the Committee.With regard to (iii) above, I already have power to assist in the administration of schemes for promoting greater regularity of employment, and I recommend that power should be taken to assist in the administration of holiday schemes (i.e. , to allow the machinery of ihe Employment Exchanges to be
used for this purpose) when this is desired &quot;by the promoters of the schemes. Such power must, I suggest, &quot;be general and cannot be restricted to certain classes of workers.     I see no reason, however, for supporting the Committee1 s recommendation that the cost of administering holiday schemes, in which my Department might he called upon to play a part, should be borne by the Exchequer.     In the case of schemes for obtaining greater regularity of employment, the cost has to he borne by the parties to the scheme, and I should propose similar arrangements in respect of holiday schemes.3.     Legislation on points (i) and (iii) would be well received in Parliament and the country.      If Parliamentary time can be found and it is the general wish of my colleagues, I should hope to he able to introduce the necessary legislation this session, in collaboration with the Secretary of State for Scotland and the Minister of Agriculture.     There is, however, a possible difficulty owing to a suggestion which I understand will be made by the Employers1 Confederation that the &quot;appointed members&quot; on the Trade Boards should not he allowed to vote on the fixing of holidays.     If this suggestion is pressed.and is opposed - as it well may be - by the Trades Union Congress there may be an element of controversy which would make it impracticable to find time for the Bill this session.4.     Other recommendations by the Committee on which action can be taken are:-(a) steps for the general co-ordination of holiday arrangements;(b) the encouragement of voluntary agreements for paid holidays;   and(c) an examination of certain anomalies in the law relating to the payment during holiday periods of contributions and benefit under the Unemployment Insurance Scheme.The Committee recommended that a special branch of the Ministry of Labour should he set up to co-ordinate and supervise holiday arrangements.    It will, I think, be agreed that each Government Department must continue to be respon-sible for executive action upon matters within its own particular sphere, but I propose to arrange for a section of the Industrial Relations Branch of the Ministry to be charged with specific duties in connection with paid holidays for industrial workers.     I also propose that a standing interdepartmental committee should be appointed to review in detail the needs of the position and co-ordinate the activities of different Departments.     It is possible that some
more formally constituted body may be needed at a later stage, but, for the moment, it seems desirable to consider what can be done by co-operation between the different Departments without the assistance of an outside body. This committee would include representatives of the Departments of Agriculture, Education and Health, for both England and Wales and Scotland, and of the Ministry of Transport, Board of Trade and the Ministry of Labour.     Other Departments would, however, send representatives as the need arose.With regard to (b) above, my Department will, of course, be ready to give every assistance to employers&apos; and workers&apos; organisations, with a view to securing voluntary agreements for paid holidays.With regard to (c) above, I have already arranged for the Unemployment Insurance Statutory Committee to consider whether any change in the law of Unemployment Insurance is required in relation to holidays.5.     The Committee also made recommendations for a fixed Easter.     They pro-posed   that the Easter Act 1928 should come into operation or, alternatively, that the Easter Bank Holiday should be fixed.     I understand that there is little prospect of action to bring the Easter Act 1928 into operation and, unless Easter itself is fixed, I do not think it would be profitable to attempt to fix the Easter Monday holiday, because to do so would spoil the present long holiday at Easter.6.     Finally,, the Committee recommended general legislation in two years&apos;time..    Holidays with pay are extending rapidly by agreement between employersand workpeople, and it may not be necessary to legislate as suggested by theCommittee.     In any case, there are still difficulties to be overcome, and itis not possible to forecast the nature of the legislation that may berequired in two or three years&apos; time.     Accordingly, I suggest that we should give a conditional promise of legislation in 1940-41, to the effect that if circumstances are such as to make it necessary, consideration will be given tothe introduction of legislation but at the present time it is not possible to forecast the nature of the legislation that may be required.7.     I propose, therefore, if my colleagues concur, to announce in the Houseof Commons that the Government accept in principle the recommendation that power should be given to Trade Boards and Agricultural Wages Committees toprovide for holidays with pay, and that I propose as soon as possible tointroduce legislation for this purpose and also to enable the Ministry ofLabour to assist in the administration of holiday schemes.3.
H.Q.1615-65 E.H.8.     I should also propose to announce:-(i) that my Department will do everything possible to encourage voluntary agreements for paid holidays; I (il) that a section of the Department has been charged with specificduties in connection with paid holidays;   and (iii) that a standing interdepartmental committee has been set up to co-ordinate the activities of Government Departments concerned, (iv) with regard to the proposals for a fixed Easter, that it is notpossible to take action at the present time to bring into operation the Easter Act 1928, in view of the difficulty of securing international agreement, or to adopt the alternative proposal of fixing the Easter Holiday, (v) with regard to general legislation at a later date,  that if circumstances are such as to make it necessary, consideration will be given to the introduction of legislation, but that at the present time it is not possible to forecast the nature of the legislation that will he required.(Int.) E.B.27th May, 1958.
