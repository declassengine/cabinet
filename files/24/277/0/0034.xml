Printed for the Cabinet,   July 1938.Gopy* No.CABINET.CONVERSATIONS WITH REPRESENTATIVES OF THE FRENCHGOVERNMENT.Memorandum by the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence.I HAVE been requested by the Committee of Imperial Defence to draw the attention of my colleagues to two matters which were raised at a meeting* of the Committee of Imperial Defence on the 30th June, 1938, in the course of a discussion regarding the conversations between representatives of the Board of Trade and the French Government on the supply in time of war of food, other raw materials and tonnage. The first concerns the scope of these conversations and is dealt with in Part I of this Memorandum. The second concerns the Naval conversations and is dealt with in Part II. An extract from the Minutes of the meeting is attached as Annex III.Part I.2.   The Cabinet, t at their meeting on the 1st June, agreed : &quot;** (a) That, in view of the statement made by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to French Ministers at the London Conversations on the 28th April, 1938, the Conversations between the two Governments should be extended so as to cover the following list: (1) Food. (2) Oil. (3) Coal.(4) Non-ferrous metals and minerals. (5) Textile and raw materials. (6) Tonnage.(b) That the Conversations should be conducted on the same basis as that on which food discussions are proceeding.&quot;3. The basis on which the food Conversations are proceeding was referred to verbally at a discussion before the Committee of Imperial Defence!, on the 28th April, 1938, but a formal statement was only submitted to that Committee recently, when it was attached to a Paper notifying the Committee of the decision of the Cabinet in regard to tonnage and the commodities other than food referred to in the previous paragraph. A copy of this statement, slightly revised as the result of the meeting of the Committee of Imperial Defence on the 30th June, is annexed to this Memorandum.fECRET.CP. 153 (38).[17484]* C.I.D./328th Meeting, Minute 1. t Cabinet 27 (38), Conclusion 10. $ C.I.D./321st Meeting, Minute 1.b
4. At the Cabinet on the 1st June, I referred to the procedure which I understood had been followed in the food discussions whereby they had been limited to considering the list of commodities which France would require from overseas in time of war and their transport. These remarks and my owsj. impression of the position were based on Sir Henry French &apos;s observations &quot;at thP Committee of Imperial Defence on the 28th April, when he said that the discussions had been on an &quot; entirely non-committal basis.&quot; This is correct in so far as the French representatives were informed that the Conversations should be regarded as entirely hypothetical and non-committal, and that it was not proposed to enter into any binding arrangements or to exchange any undertakings as to what course might be pursued in any of the circumstances.5. As will be seen, however, from paragraph 6 of the Annex, arrangements proposed for the purchase of commodities for French requirements were discussed and agreement was reached on general principles as follows :  (a) France to purchase on Great Britain&apos;s account those commodities which her Colonies could provide.(b) Great Britain to purchase on French account those commodities which british Empire countries could provide.(c) Joint Purchasing Commissions to operate in foreign countries under instructions from an inter-Allied Commission in London.(d) It was agreed that plans should be discussed as soon as possible (i.e., inpeace-time) so as to enable an inter-Allied Commission to be brought into existence and to function as soon as practicable after the outbreak of hostilities.6. The discussion at the Committee of Imperial Defence revealed anxiety on the part of some members of the Cabinet as to the position at which we might arrive if the conversations on the oil, coal, non-ferrous metals and minerals, textiles and raw materials and tonnage are conducted on the same basis as in the case of food. Moreover, they felt that such a procedure might go farther than was intended by the Cabinet at its meeting on the 1st June.7. It is true that the conversations are being undertaken subject to an overall condition precluding any formal commitment or agreement. Nevertheless, their scope is very wide and, taken over a range of products of such importance, would amount in the aggregate to little short of a civilian War Plan concerted between-the two countries though, of course, the execution of the plan would be subject to the decision of the two Governments when the emergency arose. The French representatives are constantly pressing for greater precision and more detailed arrangements, and there is always a danger that conversations, the exchange of information and the formulation of plans, in spite of our constant endeavour to keep their non-committal character in the foreground, may be interpreted by the French in such a way as to lead ultimately to the suggestion by the French that they have relied on the provisional arrangements being carried out, and have made all their plans on that understanding. Moreover, it was suggested that a leakage of information disclosing the elaborate and wide scope of the plans between ourselves and France, coming as. an addition to the military conversations, might have seriously prejudicial effects on the hope of improved relations between this country and Germany.8. On the other hand the view was also strongly expressed that conversations which did not lead to the preparation of plans to meet the circumstances disclosed by the exchange of information were of little if any value, and that the prepara-tion of plans need not involve any commitments. The President of the Board of Trade represented that it would be difficult to conduct negotiations in regard to food on one basis and in regard to other commodities, to which much the same conditions apply, on&quot;-some totally different and more restricted basis. The conversations about oil/ for example, have revealed a position in regard to the joint requirements of aviation fuel which calls for serious consideration. It was suggested that the Board of Trade would incur a grave responsibility if, in the event of the contingency materialising, the Board, though aware in advance of the difficulties of the position, had taken no steps jointly to work out a possible solution.
9. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs considered that no unfavourable German reaction need be anticipated from a mere extension of the basis of the civil conversations from the ascertainment of requirements to the reparation of hypothetical joint plans. If Germany was going to react hfavourably to our conversations with the French, she &quot;would have done so in connection with those between the military staffs, about which she was frankly informed at the time, and which had a beneficial rather than an unfortunate effect upon her attitude.10. 1 feel myself that my colleagues as a whole should now receive the infor-mation prepared for the Committee of Imperial Defence, so as to enable them to appreciate fully the. range already covered by the food conversations, the extension of Which to the other principal imported commodities and tonnage was approved by the Cabinet on the 1st June, and it is for this reason that I bring the matter again to their notice. Whilst I do not accept the view that conyer-sations restricted to a general survey of joint requirements would be Of negligible value in the preparation of our own plans, I do not wish to raise objection to the continuance of the conversations on the proposed footing, provided that I am satisfied that my colleagues are aware of what is taking place.11. The Committee of Imperial Defence feel, hoWever, that the basis on which these talks are to be conducted should be laid down more precisely than has hitherto been the case. It is not practicable in any formula to prescribe the exact point at which a halt should be called to the conversations, and discretion must accordingly be left to those concerned^to report back for further instructions at an appropriate stage.Subject to this comment, however, I suggest that formal authority should be given for the continuation of the conversations on food, oil, coal, non-ferrous metals and minerals, textile and raw materials and tonnage to be undertaken with representatives of the French Government on the basis (i) that the conversations are designed to meet a purely hypothetical contingency, that no commitments or agreements should be entered into, and that no question arises of taking a final decision now, on action to be taken, if the contingency materialises, which remains a matter solely for the Government of the day; (ii) that conversations should begin with an exchange of information on estimated requirements and discussions regarding the basis on which estimates have been framed;(iii) that, where no question arises of overlapping requirements, e.g., in thecase of coal, the conversations should not be carried any further;(iv) that, in cases where requirements may overlap, conversations should becontinued to cover the preparation of an outline of contingent arrangements to secure the necessary co-ordination; (v) that the Foreign Office should be associated with the conversations at all stages;(vi) that steps should be taken, by consultation with the Treasury, to ensurethat the financial position is properly safeguarded; (vii) that reports should be submitted periodically by  the Department concerned to the Committee of Imperial Defence regarding the state of the various conversations, and in the event of any question of principle arising.Part II.12. In the course of the discussion on the matters above referred to, the Naval Conversations were mentioned as an illustration of the danger that provisional and non-committal arrangements might be interpreted and treated as definite undertakings. The point was made that the French Naval Authorities might redistribute their fleet on the strength of the war dispositions of the British Fleet as disclosed to them in the course of the conversations notwithstanding a proviso regarding the absence of any commitment and that, in the event of a war in which we did not take part, they might then find themselves at a serious disadvantage by reason of the redistribution.[17484] b 2
13. A note on the Naval Conversations prepared by the Admiralty, which is attached as Annex II to this memorandum, indicates that no special redistribution-tion has yet been made, that little value is likely to be secured from the conversations already held unless suggestions are put forward for the redistribution^ tion of the French or British Forces, and that any such suggestions from our sidfP in regard to the French Forces might have unfortunate results, even though they were guarded by a further repetition of the no commitment proviso.14. This makes it necessary in my submission to reconsider the subject of Naval Staff. Conversations, apart from the light which they throw on the subject of the Conversations on the matters mentioned in Part I. I feel it is desirable to avoid any step which might lend support to the idea that moves of French Naval units made on our suggestion involve any obligations on our part. Accordingly, I think that it should be left to the French to make any suggestions for further redistribution of the Naval units of either country, and I recommend that the Cabinet should record a decision to this&apos; effect.(Initialled) T.

Discussions between the Food (Defence Plans) Department and representatives of H the French Government.1. THE Committee of Imperial Defence Sub-Committee on Food Supply in Time of War, at its Meeting on the 16th July, 1937, decided : &apos;&apos; to authorise technical discussions to be opened, in consultation with the Foreign Office, on the lines set out in Paper No. F.S. 39, with represen-tatives of the Governments of Belgium, France, Netherlands, Argentina and Denmark.&quot; * .2. Following a preliminary conversation with the French Commercial Attache in London, the Food (Defence Plans) Department of the Board of Trade was notified that the Attache&quot; had been authorised by his Government to have informal discussions with the Department. He was then given by the Department an explanatory memorandum, dated the 7th January, 1938, from which the following is extracted : It is intended that the conversations should be entirely hypothetical and non-committal, and it is not proposed to enter into any binding arrange-ments or to exchange any undertakings as to what course might be pursued in any given circumstances.The Food (Defence Plans) Department attach importance to means being-devised which would enable the Governments concerned, if they so decided at the time, to secure co-ordinated purchase of food supplies from sources outside Europe immediately upon the outbreak of hostilities with a view to ensuring that the price of these imports should not be increased as would inevitably occur if the Governments concerned made purchases in competition with each other.If measures of this kind are to be adopted, there would be great advantage in their being applied immediately before price inflation begins. If this is to be secured, an understanding in advance as to the administrative machinery to be set up for the purpose upon the outbreak of hostilities appears to be essential.It is accordingly proposed that an exchange of information and ideas should take place in regard to :  (i) the machinery that might have to be brought into existence for facilitating co-ordination in the supply of imported food and feeding-stuffs to the two countries; and (ii) the probable requirements of each food and feeding-stuff during the first month and the first year of a major war.3. Subsequently, a list of the French food requirements from overseas was supplied from Paris showing, as had been suggested, the quantities required (a) in the first month after the outbreak of hostilities and (b) annually.4. On the 22nd March, 1938, the French Commercial Attache, with an expert from Paris, attended at the offices of the Food (Defence Plans) Department. A representative of the Foreign Office was present at the meeting. For the purposes of the discussion, the French list was sub-divided into three groups as follows : . Group 1. Commodities in respect of which arrangements for co-ordinated purchase of supplies from overseas appears to be essential in order to prevent a substantial rise in price.Group 2. Commodities in respect of which similar arrangements are desirable.Group 3. Commodities in respect of which, on the basis of existing information, a scheme of co-ordinated purchase is not necessary.5. Discussions, lasting two days, took place on each of the items. The value of this detailed examination may be illustrated by reference to frozen meat. The French had proposed to purchase in Argentina, for delivery during the first
month of war, 40,000 tons of frozen meat. This was not required for immediate consumption, but to constitute a &quot; security stock &quot; to be maintained, so far as practicable, throughout the war. It was pointed out by the representatives of the Food (Defence Plans) Department that ah abnormal order of this magnitude placed in South America, immediately upon the outbreak of hostilities, could not fail to send up the price of all meat supplies from overseas immediately. As a result of the discussion which ensued, it has been agreed that the French Govern-ment should not take any steps to place an order in Argentina for frozen meat on the outbreak of war, but that the United Kingdom should, assuming that satisfactory shipping arrangements can be made, allocate to France 10,000 tons for delivery, if possible, during the first month.6. Discussions were continued on the 23rd May, when the French delega-tion included a shipping expert. A detailed list of French requirements was examined and the arrangements proposed for the purchase of each commodity (both urgent purchases, which might commence even before the outbreak of hostilities, and subsequent purchases) were discussed. The general principles on which agreement was noted are as follows :  (i) France to purchase on Great Britain&apos;s account those commodities which her colonies could provide, (ii) Great Britain to purchase on French account those commodities which british Empire countries could provide, (hi) Joint purchasing Missions to operate in foreign countries under instructions from an Inter-Allied Commission in London. But in the case of frozen meat and maize from South America, Great Britain would purchase on behalf of both countries. It was agreed that plans should be discussed as soon as possible (i.e., in peace time), so as to enable the Inter-Allied Commission to be brought into existence and to function as soon as practicable after the outbreak of hostilities. The French delegates reported that the French Government attached importance to this matter.It was also agreed that the finance and shipment of French requirements should be arranged by France in consultation with the competent British Authorities not only because these matters were outside the province of the Food (Defence Plans) Department, but also because they could not be confined to food-stuffs and would require to be considered as a whole. French tonnage requirements in time of war for food and other commodities were discussed between the French delegates and Mercantile Marine Department of the Board of Trade on the 24th May, and it was agreed that in light of the information furnished further consideration should be given to the whole problem.No detailed discussions have yet taken place with regard to finance.As regards further discussions it was agreed that the Food (Defence Plans) Department would maintain contact with the French Commercial Attache in London with a view to the exchange of information and the keeping up to date of the estimates considered during the conversations.ANNEX II.-   Naval Staff Conversations.WE have informed the French Naval Staff in general terms of our naval dispositions for war against Germany. We expect to receive in return a general description of French Naval dispositions. We had, however, before the conver-sations began, learned from the French that they have recently completed a redistribution of their fleet, which they have described as &quot; final,&quot; under which all their capital ships, including their battle cruisers, will be based on Brest. We anticipate that the dispositions which will now be communicated to us by the French Staff will be the same as those we have received above.
Our naval dispositions are made without taking account of the French Fleet, and it will probably appear that France&apos;s are made similarly, without taking account of our Fleet. It is obvious that the two navies, if allied, would not thus I be disposed to the best possible effect. The First Sea Lord pointed out that, should 9 we in the course of the Naval Staff Conversations point this out to the French and suggest any alterations in their dispositions, such as the transfer of part of their capital ship force to the Mediterranean, the French might agree to the idea, even though it was guarded by the statement that these conversations do not commit us. If they did so, they would have to make important administrative arrangements for the new disposition. We have always understood that in France such arrangements are more difficult to alter, and, therefore, more binding in effect than they are with us. Consequently, if France eventually found herself at war with Germany (Great Britain remaining neutral), she might be unable, on account of an arrangement as mentioned above, to redispose her fleet in what she considers to be the best way for that emergency. She might then turn round and say that on our assurances she had transferred some of her forces to the Mediterranean, and that if, therefore, we now did not implement the arrangement that had been discussed, she would be gravely affected.Alternatively, if we do not make any such suggestions, or discuss any redistribution of the French or British forces on the basis of an allied war, the conversations will serve correspondingly little purpose.Naval Staff, June 30, 1938.ANNEX III.Extract from the DRAFT Minutes of the 328th Meeting held on June 30, 1938.(1).-EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION WITH THE BELGIAN AND FRENCH GOVERNMENTS ON THE SUPPLY IN TIME OF WAR OF FOOD, OTHER RAW MATERIALS AND TONNAGE.(C.I.D. Paper No. 1439-B.) (Previous reference :  C.I.D. Minutes of the 320th Meeting, Minute 1.)THE COMMITTEE had under discussion a note by the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence covering a Memorandum by the Secretary with an Annex summing up the present position in regard to the Conversations authorised by the Cabinet between the British and French Governments on the subject of the Supply in Time of War of Food, other Raw Materials and Tonnage (C.I.D. Paper No. 1439-B).LORD HALIFAX said that he felt obliged to draw attention to the very brief interval elapsing between the circulation and discussion of this Paper. His Dejoartment had not had an adequate opportunity for examining it, though he was, in fact, prepared to comment on it if there was a general desire that consideration of it should proceed.SIR MAURICE HANKEY said that the original intention had been to send it to the Cabinet, but, owing to the need for consultation with the President of the Board of Trade, it had not been possible to do so in time for the current week&apos;s meeting. He recognised and regretted that members of the Committee had only received short notice of the question, but it was felt to be a matter of some importance which should be brought to the notice of the responsible Ministers at an early date.SIR THOMAS INSKIP said the Memorandum was intended to bring the matter to the notice of the Committee of Imperial Defence in order that they might be aware of what was happening. The question had. been before the Committee before * and the Secretary for Mines had then suggested, in regard* C.I.D./320th Meeting, Minute 1.
to oil and coal, that the Conversations might well follow the same lines as those in regard to food, but that they should, in the first place, be confined to the ascertainment of French requirements, and thereafter further instructions should be obtained from the Committee of Imperial Defence. At the same meetings. Sir Henry French, explaining the procedure which had been followed in regard to food, said that the discussions had, of course, been conducted on an entirely non-committal basis. It now appeared, however, that the Conversations in regard to food, as reported on in the Annex to C.I.D. Paper No. 1439-B, had gone a good deal further than a mere exchange of information as to requirements.Mr. OLIVER STANLEY referred to the Cabinet* decision on the 1st June, at which it was agreed that Conversations in regard to commodities other than food should be conducted on the same basis as those for food. The Cabinet had never recognised the limitation of the food discussions to the ascertainment of French requirements nor, indeed, had any such limitation been laid down by the Committee of Imperial Defence. That committee had on the 28th April so restricted the Conversations on the other commodities, but this decision was reversed by the Cabinet on the 1st June. He thought that it would be extremely difficult to conduct Conversations with the representatives of the French Govern-ment on one basis for food and on another basis for all the other commodities referred to.SIR THOMAS INSKIP said that, so far as he recalled the discussion, the Foreign Secretary at the Cabinet expressed the view that he was not anxious to go any further in regard to commodities other than food than had been done in the case of food. He (Sir Thomas Inskip) had explained that the food Conversations had been limited to an exchange of information and that no commitments had been made. The discussions, as now disclosed, had gone beyond the limit which he understood was to be observed; but he did not wish to raise any objection so long as the Committee of Imperial Defence and the Cabinet was aware of and approved the arrangements.SIR JOHN SIMON drew attention to paragraph 6 (iii) of the Annex to the Paper, setting out the general principles on which agreement had been reached, part of which read as follows : &quot; It was agreed that it would be desirable for the Inter-Allied Commission in London to be organised (i.e., in peace-time).&quot;He wondered if this really expressed the intentions of the Board of Trade. He was disposed to think that the real meaning was that plans should be discussed in peace-time so as to enable the Inter-Allied Commission in London to be organised and set up as soon as possible after the outbreak of hostilities. A proposal to discuss in peace-time plans to set up as rapidly as possible after the outbreak of war a joint organisation of the two countries need not be regarded as a commitment. A proposal to set up an Inter-Allied Commission in peace-time was on a very different footing.Mr. OLIVER STANLEY agreed that there was some ambiguity in the sentence. In fact it was, of course, the intention to make plans in peace-time to set up the organisation after and not before the outbreak of war.LORD HALIFAX said he had also noticed this sentence. The explanation of the President disposed of any anxiety he felt as to its meaning and as to the wider scope which would have been involved in its extension to discussions on the other commodities.SIR THOMAS INSKIP stated that the record of the food Conversations indicated that certain agreements as to procedure and provisional commitments had been entered into, and he felt that the Cabinet ought to be informed. He did not think that the Supply Departments should slip into elaborating detailed plans with the corresponding Departments of the French Government without the approval of the Cabinet.: SIR KINGSLEY WOOD agreed that the correction to paragraph 6 (iii) of the Annex should be recorded, but he thought they ought also to avoid taking any steps which would commit them to an alliance with France against Germany* Cabinet 27 (38), Conclusion 10. f C.I.D./321st Meeting, Minute 1.
and the definite preparation of a war plan with France to meet such a contingency. This was the sort of way in which the seeds of the next war might be sown.   He understood this was also the Foreign Secretary&apos;s view.&apos; LORD HALIFAX pointed out that the Cabinet&apos;s agreement was directed towards an examination of the position that might result in certain hypothetical conditions; and they had drawn particular attention to the importance of avoiding all commitments. His own view was that it was of little value to have Conversations if they were to be restricted merely to the ascertainment of French requirements, and if all such problems as to how to avoid competitive buying and the raising of prices were to be excluded.Mr. OLIVER STANLEY said that he did not want to go beyond the views of the Committee or the Cabinet, but he was anxious to know exactly what these views were. In the case of some commodities, for example coal, it was probable that the ascertainment of French requirements was all that was necessary, any further action being entirely a matter for ourselves. On the other hand, in regard to certain other commodities, e.g., aviation spirit, the French would be in competition with ourselves for available supplies. In this case, the French require-ments had been stated, and it was clear that the satisfaction of their requirements and of our own constituted a very difficult problem. Was no attempt to be made beforehand to think out a solution? If that was so, the Board of Trade would be faced with a very grave responsibility when the contingency arose. Whilst, therefore, it was possible to restrict the Conversations to the ascertainment of requirements if it was desired to do so, he thbught that such a limitation rendered them quite useless from the point of view of preparations to meet a possible contingency.SIR KINGSLEY WOOD said that he felt some concern as to what was to be the end of these Conversations. They might result in something very near to an alliance with France.SIR THOMAS INSKIP said that he felt that the Conversations in regard to food had proceeded further than the Cabinet intended. The discussions both at the Committee of Imperial Defence and at the Cabinet had disclosed apprehensions less the Conversations should gradually slip into formal plans, agreements and an alliance. It was felt that sooner or later the fact that general preparations were being made for carrying out a detailed supply plan on the side of the French Government in a war would leak out. Such a procedure went further than a mere survey of requirements which was all that was required for placing both countries in a position to make plans at comparatively short notice.Mr. DUFF COOPER said that he did not think that conversations could usefully take place without leading to plans, but it was quite possible to prepare plans without entering into commitments. The Naval Conversations were leading to certain Naval plans, but not to any commitments.LORD HALIFAX observed that every country, and certainly France, was no doubt working out in peace time its wartime requirements of the most important commodities. Accordingly, if an emergency arose France would be able to inform us of their estimated requirements within a few hours. There seemed, therefore, to be little point in entering into conversations in peace-time if they led to nothing more than could be known as soon as hostilities started. He shared to the full the anxiety of the Secretary of State for Air in regard to our relations with Germany, but he could not help thinking that there was a danger of attaching an exaggerated importance to this matter. If Germany was to react unfavourably, it would not be because of the extension of these conversations from a mere ascertainment of requirements to a non-committal preparation of plans, but on account of the fact that conversations, whether between Military or Civil Staffs, were being undertaken at all. Germany had been told frankly about the con-versations between the Military Staffs and it had had a valuable effect in steadying their reactions generally. To ascertain requirements and refrain from thinking out plans as to how they should be met seemed to him utterly unreal.mr. JOHN SIMON suggested that the basis on which the conversations should be carried out should be formulated more precisely.   It was not a question of making a final decision now on a particular line of joint action to be taken at [17484] c
some future date. All that was being done was to explore the most appropriate method by which the situation could be dealt with if and when a hypothetical contingency materialised, and if the two Governments took decisions to that effect. This was obviously prudent from the point of view of. saving time later. ^ They could work out the methods to be adopted, the estimated cost and the time that would be required to give effect to a particular line of action. The plans could then be put into cold storage and a decision as to whether they were to be implemented or not could be taken when the contingency arose.Mr. OLIVER STANLEY said that the ChancellorV statement entirely lepresented his view.SIR JOHN SIMON drew attention tb one further point. He observed from paragraph 6 (i) of the Annex that France was to purchase on Great Britain&apos;s account those commodities Avhich her colonies could provide, and later it was stated that no detailed discussions had yet taken place with regard to finance. He trusted that steps were being taken to see that the financial position was properly safeguarded. The general principle that France should be a buying agent for commodities produced within her colonies could only be accepted subject to proper arrangements as regards finance. The French Government could not be given a blank cheque.LORD CHATFIELD raised another point in regard to conversations. There was a definite possibility that, as a result of such conversations and in spite of the proviso as to commitments, the French Government might take a certain line of action which would be quite sound if we went into a war as their Allies but which would leave them in a very serious position if we stayed out of the War. In the case of the naval conversations, for example, they might, without consulting us, alter the dispositions of their Naval forces to their great disadvantage if they got involved in a war in which we were not their allies. A similar situation might arise in connection with some commodity which, as the result of the conversations, they had assumed that we would supply. They might then turn round and say that we had been responsible for their difficult position and that we ought to implement the arrangements discussed.Mr. OLIVER STANLEY said that the problem was a different one in the case of the civil discussions, and arose because the two countries might be allies and were both concerned. Increased supplies of the same commodity would be required by both countries. If the French were in the war alone difficulties of this kind would not exist.. SIR THOMAS INSKIP said he thought the considerations applying to the Service conversations applied also to the civil conversations, though not perhaps on such a dramatic or serious scale. The French might be able to turn round and say that they had been under the impression that they could rely on this country for certain supplies.SIR KINGSLEY WOOD repeated that he thought the conversations were going further than the Cabinet intended.SIR JOHN SIMON, referring to Lord Chatfield&apos;s remarks, said that he was under the impression that it was part of the conditions on which the. staff conversations were taking place that the French would not alter their naval dispositions by reason of the conversations. He doubted whether the Cabinet had knowingly authorised staff conversations on a basis which allowed the French to think themselves justified in altering their naval dispositions.LORD HALIFAX said he thought that a distinction should be drawn between the two sets of conversations in any paper that might be sent forward to the Cabinet.SIR THOMAS INSKIP undertook to submit a memorandum to the Cabinet, drawing attention to the points which had been raised in the course of the discussion.SIR MAURICE HANKEY recalled that the conversations on food were not confined to France, but extended also to other countries such as Holland and Denmark, which were likely to remain neutral in the event of a European war. The inclusion of these countries tended, perhaps, to diminish any impression that
the conversations with France might give of an Anglo-French alliance. He asked whether a corresponding procedure was contemplated in the case of other commodities.^    . SIR THOMAS INSKIP thought that the point deserved consideration.Conclusions. The Committee of Imperial Defence agreed : :(a) To record that the words in paragraph 6 (iii) of the Annex to theEnclosure to Paper No. C.I.D. 1439-B, &quot; it was agreed that it would be desirable for the Inter-Allied Commission in London to be organised as soon as possible (i.e., in peace time),&quot; incorrectly represented the position, and should be amended to read : &apos;&apos; It was agreed that plans should be discussed as soon as possible (i.e., in peace time), so as to enable the Inter-Allied Commission to be brought into existence and to function as soon as practicable after the outbreak of hostilities.&quot;(b) To recommend that the basis, on which the conversations with repre-sentatives of the French Government in regard to supplies in time of war should be conducted, should be more clearly defined.(c) To take note that the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence would submit a Memorandum to the Cabinet drawing their attention to the present position and suggesting a more definite basis for the conversations.(d) That the question of whether the conversations on some or all of the commodities other than food and on tonnage might be extended (as in the case of, foodstuffs) to certain countries that were likely to be neutral in a European war, should be reserved for further consideration by the Board of Trade in consultation with the Foreign Office.-if- m. ^. -u- -ifc -U-&quot;7V- *7v* &quot;Jv&quot; *JV&quot; W IT2 Whitehall Gardens, S.
