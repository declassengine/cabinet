(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT).S E C R B T.CP.  151(38). COPY NO.&apos;    CABINET, ELECTRICITY DISTRIBUTION BILL. REPORT OP CABINET COMMITTEE.1. At their Meeting on 1st June, 1938 (Cabinet 27 (38)Conclusion 9) the Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theMinister of Transport (CP. 125 (38)), containing a briefsummary of the position reached in the preparation of, andthe negotiations upon, the Electricity Distribution Bill, andan appreciation of its political prospects.The Cabinet agreed as follows :--&quot;That a Cabinet    Committee composed as follows:The President of the Board of Education(In the Chair),The Secretary of State for Air,The Secretary of State for Scotland,The President of the Board of Trade,The Minister of Health,The Minister of Labour,The Minister of Transport,should consider the Minister of Transport&apos;s Memorandum (CP. 125 (38)) and advise the Cabinet as to whether the Bill should be proceeded with in the forthcoming Session of Parliament, giving special consideration to the advantages and disadvantages of this course from a political point of view&quot;.2. In accordance with our reference, we have consideredCP. 125 (38) and a further memorandum by the Minister of Transport E.D.B. (38). 2,   and also the Report of the Conference of the Leaders of the Electricity Industry submitted to the then Minister of Transport in 1933.     A full statement of the economic grounds for proceeding to reorganise the distribution of electricity supply is contained in the documents already circulated to the Cabinet, and we need not recapitulate them.
3. Briefly, however, it may he said that all thoseacquainted with the needs of the industry have come to the conclusion that comprehensive reorganisation of the distribution of electricity is urgently needed in the interests of consumers and, more particularly, in the interests of those consumers who live in rural areas, and that no such reorganisation will come about without a substantial measure of compulsion involving further legislation.,      It cannot be hoped that any appreciable advance towards voluntary reorganisation will take place so long as legislation is delayed, since every authority will wait to see upon what terras and conditions, financial and otherwise, it is likely to be transferable.40 The King!s Speech last October contained a definitepromise of legislation in the following terms:-!,A measure for improving the distribution of electricity will be laid before you.&quot;The postponement of this legislation will inevitably create a sense of uncertaintya     It will delay expenditure on capital works including that required for an extension ofsupply to the less remunerative areas.5. It will meanwhile be difficult to prevent prejudice to future reorganisation on the lines recommended by the McGov/an- Committee3     For example, the rights of local authorities to purchase the parts of the undertakings of the distribution companies in their areas will mature and involve decisions as to whether consent should be given. The Electricity Commissioners have been able, while legislation was understood to be imminent, to secure by agreement a limited postponement of the claim to exercise those rights;   but if the declared intention to introduce legislation is not implemented or appears to be abandoned
it will be difficult for the Commissioners upon any such ground to withhold any consent or approval which the undertakers may he required to obtain, and it may not be possible to prevent, when such cases occur, the partial disintegration of supply units which are at present of sufficient size and comprise sufficiently diverse areas of supply and types of demand to satisfy the criterialaid down in the McGowan Reports-6, The Committee while recognising the force of theabove considerations are unanimously of the opinion that it would be inadvisable to proceed with legislation such as would in this case be necessary during the closing stages of a Parliament,,    , It must be recognised that a measure of reform of this character, whatever its precise shape, inevitably attracts hostile criticism from interests affected by it, and the grievances of these critics are immediate, while the fruits of the reform and the general benefits to consumers are necessarily in-the futureo7. We have considered whether it would be possible tointroduce any interim measure to stereotype the present position for a period of say three years, but we have come to the conclusion that any such measure would inevitably raise many of the issues fundamental to the Bill at present under consideration and thus be controversial. In fact it would be regarded - and not without reason -by the local authorities as an attack pure and simple upon theii-&quot; statutory rights08, We have also considered   whether it would be advisable to make any immediate announcement, should the
Cabinet accept our conclusions0     We have formed the opinion that the announced intention of the Government should not be withdrawn or, for the present, amplified, We think that the Cabinet may prefer not to take a decision at present but to leave the matter in abeyance until next autumn1s programme a     The smaller municipal undertakers have themselves put forward certain additional or alter^mtive^schemes of reorganisation. While these are not at present in a form which can be said to be agreed by the industry generally, or, indeed, to be workable, they could be made the subject of the further negotiation which their authors expect.9. Our conclusions and recommendations may be summari-sed as follows:-(a) In spite of the need for the reorganisation ofelectricity distribution, the proposed Bill should not be introduced in the last year of the present parliament to(b) Any interim measure to prevent a worsening ofthe present position of the electricity distribution industry would be open to many of the same objecii ons as a major Bill for the reorganisation of the industry and to some of them in a more acute form.(c) No further statement should be made for thepresent as to the Governments intentions inregard to legislation but the matter should be left in abeyance until the autumn.Signed on behalf of the Committee.STANHOPE.Chairman,)Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1. 30th June, 1938,
