,j 4)     9(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT) . SECRET .CAB I NET.CP.159(38)BRITISH NATIONALITY AND STATUS OF ALIENS BILL  (H.L.)Memorandum by the Home Secretary.1. This Bill  (copy attached) is down for Second reading in the House of Lords on 21st July, and it is necessary to decide what line shall be taken by the Government Spokesman. The Bill would effect drastic alterations in the existing law by providing that a British born woman on marriage to an alien shall retain her British nationality,  that an alien woman shall not acquire British nationality by reason of her marriage to a British subject and that a married woman may apply for naturalisation in her own right.2. It will be seen from the appended memorandum that thequestion of the nationality of married women has been the subject of consultation with the Dominions at Imperial Conferences and otherwise.      Certain modifications in the existing law were made by the Act of 1933, which was passed to give effect to certain articles of the Hague Convention of 1930,  in which the Dominions concurred.      Apart from these alterations, it has not been found possible to arrive at any agreement with the Dominions for a change in the existing law.3. When the question was under discussion by the Leagueof Nations at Geneva in 1931,   the British delegate, with the authority of the then Home Secretary, made a declaration in favour of the principle that all disabilities of married women in matters of nationality should be removed and that a married woman should be in the same position as a man.Copy No
-24. Even if the present Government were in agreement withthis general principle,  I think it would be inexpedient that any statement to this effect should be made on the motion for the Second Reading of this Bill.      Such a declaration would naturally lead to demands for action, and failure to implement the hopes roused by such a declaration would be likely to arouse further opposition from the women interested in this subj ect.5. I suggest that the proper line for the government representative would be to summarise the history of this -question,  to emphasize the importance of maintaining proper uniformity in the law throughout the Commonwealth affecting the &quot;common status&quot;,  to refer sympathetically to the cases of hardship resulting from loss of British nationality on marriage, to say that the Government recognises, as was indicated by the last resolution of the Imperial Conference,   that the subject is one for still further consultation, but to point out that in the circumstances the Government can offer no facilities for the Bill.     A non-committal speech of this kind is,  I am sure,  the best method of dealing with a matter in which the Government cannot,  at the present stage at any rate,  take any practical steps to meet the views of the women&apos;s organisations.S.H.14th July,  1938 .
appendix.1.     The first two paragraphs of the explanatory memorandum attached to the Bill are an accurate and sufficient summary of the course of British legislation, except that no reference is made to the fact that in 1914 an important innovation was introduced which enabled a woman married to a British subject to retain her British nationality by making a declaration if her husband ceased to be a British subject during the marriage.     It should perhaps also be mentioned that prior to 1870 it was not possible for any British subject, whether man or woman, to abandon the allegiance owed to the Crown, either by becoming naturalized in a foreign country, or by making a declaration of alienage.2.     As stated in the memorandum, the general principle stated in the Act of 1914 is that a wife&apos;s nationality follows that of her husband. But for many years past there have been certain exceptions from the principle, and in 1933 an Act was passed providing that a woman should retain her British nationality on marriage to an alien if she did not by reason of the marriage acquire her husband1 s nationality.     This modification was made to give effect to an International Convention agreed to at The Hague in 1930 at which the United Kingdom representative spoke in favour of women being put in the same position as men.3.     The question whether any further step can be taken in the direction of equality between the sexes and of freeing married women from disabilities in matters of nationality has come up for discussion at successive Imperial Conferences.     The Imperial Conference of 1930 recorded that it was assumed that as all the members of the Commonwealth represented at the Hague Conference had signed the Nationality Convention, such legislation as was necessary would be introduced to give effect to Articles   8-10.     The Conference was, however, satisfied that any proposals for the further modification of the principle of the existing rule would fail to secure unanimous agreement and they, therefore, felt themselves unable to make any recommendation for the substantive amendment of the law on this subject which went beyond what was agreed at the Hague Conference.4.     Later in the year a Bill with the same objects as the present Bill was introduced by Dr. Bentham and reached Second Reading.     The Home Secretary, Mr. Clynes, stated that in view of the need for main-taining imperial unity, the Government could not support the Bill, but was prepared to consider the question of promoting legislation to enable women who had lost British nationality on marriage to enjoy in this country their previous rights and privileges.xArticle 8.   If the national law of the wife causes her.to lose her&apos; nationality on marriage to a foreigner,, this consequence shall be conditional on her acquiring the nationality of her husband.Article 9.   If the national law of the wife causesnationality upon a change m the nationality or during marriage, this consequence shall b on her acquiring her husband1 s new nationality.Article 10.   Naturalization of the husband during marriage shall not involve a change in the nationality of the wife except with her consent.
5.     At the beginning of 1931 the Council of the League put upon the Agenda a proposal for the continued study of the subject of the nationality of women and asked the Secretary-General to submit a report on the question after consultation with certain women&apos;s organisations. A communication was sent to the Dominions in July of 1931 and it was suggested that there should.be another Imperial discussion at Geneva and the proposals which the United Kingdom were disposed to accept were set out.     These proposals accepted the demands of the women&apos;s organisations at the Conference.6.     The result of the League discussions was that the United Kingdom delegation proposed a resolution asking Governments to submit their observations on the question to the Assembly of 1932, and this resolution was carried.7.     The Australian Government consulted us and we concurred in their reply, viz., that they were prepared to accept the principle that a woman on marriage should not lose her nationality or acquire a now nationality without her consent, and that they would amend their law accordingly provided the United Kingdom and the other Dominions were agreeable to take similar action.     The South African Government replied that the general question of equality in nationality law was a matter touching municipal law, and that the Hague Convention represented the extent to which they were prepared to make a concession to the principle of differing nationalities in the family.     The United Kingdom reply was that we were prepared to ratify the Hague Convention as soon as the necessary domestic legislation had been passed;    that the Convention appeared to represent the greatest measure of agreement likely to be reached for the present, and constituted an advance;   that the question of going further in the direction of giving effect to the principle of equality must depend on the extent to which that principle receives the support of other Governments and especially of other members of the British Commonwealth.8.     No replies were apparently sent by Canada, New Zealand and the Irish Free State.9.     At the Assembly in 1952 it was again not possible to reach unanimity in inter-Imperial discussions.The instructions sent to the United Kingdom representative at Geneva in 193$ by the Home Secretary in the first National Government (Lord Samuel) were to try to persuade the Dominions to accept the principle of equality of the sexes;   and if this should prove impossible to state in the Committee that the Government of the United Kingdom accepted that principle.Our delegate at Geneva accordingly declared that the Government considered it right that all disabilities of married women in matters of nationality should be removed and that, in so far as nationality is concerned, a married woman should be in the same position as a man, married or unmarried, or any single woman.
10.      In 1933, the Government came to the conclusion that it could delay no longer legislation to give effect to the Hague Convention and that the Bill should be confined to this object.     There was naturally pressure during the debates for the Government to go further in the direction of equality.     The Government, however, refrained from making any declaration on the merits of this question on the ground that the necessity of.maintaining the principle of uniformity in British nation-ality throughout the Commonwealth was of paramount importance and they have maintained this attitude ever since, both at Geneva in 1932, 1933, 1935 and 1936 and elsewhere.11.     The matter was raised again at the Imperial Conference last year when it was noted that since 1950 legislation on the lines recommended in the Hague Convention had been passed in the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, and that the introduction of similar legislation in South Africa was contemplated.     No reference was made to the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1935, which contains provisions relating to the nationality of married persons based on the principle of equal treatment for men and women, because that Act ignored and repudiated the common status as understood by us, and indeed was designed to take the Irish Free State outside the scheme of British nationality law.     Reference was, however, made to the legislation recently passed in the Commonwealth of Australia and New Zealand which does not affect the common status of British subjects but -under which a woman who prior to her marriage was a British subject but ceased to be a British subject by reason of her marriage to an alien may retain the Commonwealth of Australia or New Zealand respect-ivoly  the political and other rights and liabilities of a British subject. &apos;12.     The Report of the Proceedings of the 1937 Conference set out the following conclusions:-&quot;A full discussion took place on the various aspects of the whole question, including(a) the enactment of legislation to provide that the nationality of married women should not necessarily be dependent on that of their husbands,(b) the possibility of securing reciprocal arrangements on the basis of the general adoption of legislation on the lines of the Australian and New Zealand legislation referred to in the secomd paragraph of this part of this report, and(c) the state of the law in countries outside the British C commonwealth.It was not found possible to arrive at an agreement in favour of any change in the existing law.     While therefore the Committee was unable to put forward any recommendations, it was assumed that the matter would be the subject of further consideration by and consulta-tion between the respective Governments.&quot;The confidential report of the discussions shows, however, that Canada, which was previously understood to be opposed to any further
modification of the law showed a disposition to favour unanimous acceptance of the proposition that a woman who marries an alien should be given an opportunity to retain the common status of a British subject. South Africa, thereupon, as was anticipated, suggested that South Africa should recognise as possessors of the common status any woman who under the law of any part of the Commonwealth was a British subject notwith-standing her marriage to an alien.     The Attorney General on behalf of the United Kingdom Government was not able to accept this view.     He stated that substantially uniform legislation by each member of the Commonwealth was necessary as regards the conditions governing both the acquisition and loss of the national status, and this, he thought, applied to the law relating to the nationality of married women.13.     The question whether the passing of the New Zealand and Australian Acts involved a breach in the uniformity of the law by which the common status had been established, was discussed with the Dominion representatives in London at the time of the Silver Jubilee of King George V, when the conclusion was set out that the law relating to the status of a British subject is quite distinct from that relating to local rights, and that a law conferring local rights on women who do not possess that status is not a matter for consultation between members of the British Commonwealth.     The legal advisers of the various departments concerned examined the question again in connection with the last Imperial Conference, and in expressing their agreement with this conclusion, emphasised that serious consequences would follow if it became the accepted doctrine that it was open to each member of the Commonwealth to regulate the conditions under which married women are to possess, or not to possess, the common status of a British subject, and added that they could not see that there is any good ground for supposing that divergencies as respect the nationality of married women would produce consequences less likely than other divergencies on a matter of principle to break up the existing system.     Moreover, once it is conceded that divergencies are admissible as respects married women, it would be difficult to resist proposals for differences as respects other provisions of British nationality law.14.     It will be seen, therefore, that the question raised by Lord. Alness&apos;s Bill is bound up with the general question of maintaining the common status of British subjects, and that on this ground alone His Majesty&apos;s Government would no doubt consider it impossible to give facilities for the passage of the Bill.     The women1 s organisations have maintained that this uniformity no longer exists and this point may be taken by the supporters of the Bill;   but, as shown above, this view has not been accepted by the United Kingdom Government.15.     It will be observed that the Bill goes beyond what is required to ensure that women who desire to do so may retain their British nationality on marriage to a foreigner.16.     It is worth remarking that full effect cannot be given to &quot;the principle of equality&quot; without international action.     It is, however, impossible to say that1,there is any prospect of obtaining international agreement at the present time.
British Nationality and Status of Aliens.   [h.l.]EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM.By the common law the nationality of a woman was not affected by her marriage. If a British woman subject married an alien, she remained British. If an alien woman married a British subject, she remained an alien.By an Act of 1844 an alien woman on marrying a British subject became a British subject. By the Naturalisation Act, 1870, a British woman for the first time in British history, on marrying an alien, lost her nationality, and became an alien. These provisions were continued in the British Nationality and Status of Aliens Acts, 1914 to 1933, with the exception that, under the 1933 Act, a woman who has married an alien retains her British nationality, if she has not acquired her husband&apos;s nationality by reason of her marriage.This Bill restores to a British woman the right which she lost in 1870 of retaining her British nationality on marriage with an alien, and provides that a woman, who has already lost her British nationality by reason of her marriage, shall regain it, unless she makes a declaration of alienage.The Bill further provides that an alien woman shall not, as heretofore, acquire British nationality by marriage with a British subject. It requires her, in case she desires to obtain British nationality, to satisfy the same conditions as to residence, oath of allegiance, &amp;c, as are required before an alien man is naturalised. At the same time, it safeguards the position of alien women who have already been recognised as British by or in consequence of their marriage.The Bill removes a married woman from the category of persons under a disability, gives her the same right as a man to apply for naturalisation in her own right, and provides that, as in the case of a natural British-born man, a natural British-born woman, notwithstanding her marriage, shall not lose her nationality unless she acquires a new nationality by a voluntary act of her own.(137) A
