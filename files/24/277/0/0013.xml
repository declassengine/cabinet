1.      There are two subjects concerning broadcasting on which I desire to obtain decisions of the Cabinet.     The first, which relates to the operation of relay services and wire broadcasting, is dealt with in the present memorandum;    the second relates to advertisement broadcasting;    and on this I am submitting a separate paper, C.P.133 (38).      The two subjects have some connection, since foreign advertising programmes are at present utilised by the privately-owned relay services.2.      The Ullswater Committee on Broadcasting, 1935, recommended that the ownership and operation of relay exchanges and the technical development of wire broadcasting in general should be undertaken by the Post Office,  the selection of the relayed programmes being entrusted to the B.B.C.3.      The Ullswater Report was considered by a Cabinet Committee and the Government&apos;s decision on,this subject (Command Paper 5207 of June 1936, item 16) was that the existing system of licensing private relay exchanges should be extended for three years (up to the 31st December, 1939), during which time &quot;the Post Office should undertake technical research and practical experimental work in distributing broadcast programmes by wire&quot;.4.      The Post Office Engineering Department have undertaken an examination of the various systems of distributing programmes by wire, e.g0, over the electricity supply network over telephone subscribers&apos; wires, and over a separateGOVERNMENT,)132(38)C A BIN ET.Relay Services and Wire Broadcasting.Memorandum by the Postmaster General.wireG)735/38
wire-network similar to those used by the existing Relay Companies.     Research and small-scale experiments have &quot; indicated that a service of high quality can be given to the public either by distribution at carrier frequencies over telephone subscribers1 wires or by distribution at audio frequencies over a.separate wire network.5. At the time when the Ullswater Report was underconsideration, distribution at carrier frequencies over telephone wires was thought very promising as a system for general adoption.      But a subscriber who is to be served by this system must either be provided with special tuning and amplifying apparatus comparable with a wireless receiving set, or have an existing set suitably adapted, and needs also a supply of electricity.     The conclusion has been reached that this system will be more complicated and expensive at the receiving end than the system of distribution at audio frequencies.6. The audio system, which is used by the existing relay-exchanges, has the advantage that little apparatus is required at the subscribers premises except a loud-speaker and a switch.      From the subscribers point of view it involves a minimum of capital outlay and a minimum of attention.     In view of this and of the fact that many potential users (particularly of the classes principally served at present by the companies)  are not telephone subscribers, it is now considered that the main demand for a number of years to come will be for a service over separate wires, although a system of distribution over the telephone lines might also be developed concurrently.7. The limited experiments so far carried out suggestthat there would he no technical difficulty in providing a Post Office service, over separate wires, of higherquality
0 3quality and .with a larger number of alternative programmes than&quot;the service now afforded by the Relay Companiesj    but there is no reliable information to show whether sufficient public support would be forthcoming to enable the service to be provided on a remunerative basis at the charge now made by private companies of good class.     The experience of the Companies in this connexion cannot be taken as a sure guide, sinoe they make a fair amount of use in the mornings and on Sundays of the advertising programmes from Radio Normandy   and Luxemburg, which would be excluded from a Post Office service.     The Companies1 methods are no doubt cheaper, both in regard to plant and personnel, than those of the Post Office; moreover, their system of obtaining payment of their charges by the employment of weekly collectors would hardly be suitable for adoption in a Government service, in view of the undesirable relationships with members of the public which it is apt to involve.     Information on the commercial prospects of a Post Office service can only be obtained by conducting an experiment in the operation of a public wire-broadoasting service on an extensive soale.     A fairly long period of trial ( a full year or more) would be desirable to test the public reaction to the programmes selected by the B.B.C., to gain some experience as to the rate at which subscribers could be obtained, and to test whether the arrangements contemplated by the Department for the collection&apos;of a large number of small weekly payments would work satisfactorily and without serious losses in respect of bad debts.It was accordingly proposed that a practical experiment should be carried out at Southampton, the choice of that town being suggested by the following considerations:-(a) After
(a) After the issue of the Ullswater Committee&apos;s Report and the announcement of the Government&apos;s deoision, the Southampton Corporation, which had been negotiating for the provision of a relay service by a private Company wrote to the Post Office stating that the Town Council considered that a relay service was definitely needed in the town, and enquiring whether the Post Office would provide a service, or, alternatively, would grant an extended licence to a Company to do so.(b) Conditions for ordinary wireless reception at Southampton are not very favourable, owing to interference by industrial services and by ships&apos; wireless.     The capital cost of providing a service throughout the Borough of Southampton, which of course covers a considerable area, was estimated at  290,000.9, The Corporation were informed at a discussion atSouthampton on 3rd December, 1937, that, subject to Parliamentary authority, the Post Office would be prepared to provide a service;    and the proposals appeared to be welcomed by the Council. 10. At the beginning of this year, application was madein the ordinary way to the Council for wayleaves for laying wires for the service.     Owing to arrears .of Council business, the application was not dealt with at the Council meeting immediately following.     In the interval- before the next meeting the wireless traders organised a very strong agitation, which included extensive advertisement in the local Press;    and as a result the Council decided to take no action as regards the grant of wayleaves.     The main arguments used against the scheme were that it would ruin the wireless retailers,with
5.with consequent heavy financial loss to the town in wages, rates, and electricity payments, and that it was an unwarrantable intrusion of a Government Department into a field proper to private enterprise.     Voting went on Party lines, the members of the Ratepayers&apos; Party, with a few exceptions, voting against, and the Labour members voting for the Post Office application. 11. It has subsequently been ascertained that on political grounds the Council is unlikely voluntarily to reverse its decision, although a number of influential members, including the Mayor,  are on other grounds in favour of the s cheme.12. The opinion of the Law Officers of the Crown has beenobtained as to the powers of the Post Office to proceed without the consent of the Corporation.     Their advice is that wires for wire-broadcasting purposes are &quot;telegraphs&quot; within the meaning of the Telegraph Acts and that, though it is open to the Corporation to impose conditions in the public interest in their capacity as highway authority, it is not open to them to refuse altogether an application for wayleaves.     They consider therefore that an appeal to the Court against the Corporations decision can reasonably be expected to result in the Postmaster General&apos;s favour.     The mere threat of an appeal might indeed be effective, if the Corporation were advised that their position was indefensible.-13. It would, however, seem injudicious for the PostOffice to use its legal powers to force the issue in the face of the Councils decision.     It could not be expected that a service inaugurated in such circumstances would receive an unprejudiced trial or would yield results which could be regarded as generally representative.     opposition in
S2in Southampton has been thoroughly organised by the trade interests, who have succeeded in stirring up a great deal of prejudice against the scheme.      If the Council&apos;s decision were over-ridden, it must be expected that an undesirable amount of publicity and agitation would result, on an issue which is obviously difficult in its political-aspects.     For these reasons it is suggested that the question of introducing a public wire broadcasting service at Southampton.should not be pursued further at present. 14. The selection of another town for the trial is not,however, an easy matter.     Whatever town was chosen there can be little doubt that the wireless trade, as soon as they heard of the scheme, would start a campaign on the same lines as that adopted at Southampton.     The position might be easier if a town were selected at which the Council had already approved the principle of a Relay Service by authorising a Company to conduct such a service, and if the Post Office bought the Company out.     Several Relay Companies have in fact already approached the Post Office with offers to sell their undertakings.     It is, however, conceivable that a Conservative Council, although they had given permission to a Company, might, as a result of pressure from the wireless trade, be unwilling to give the same facilities to the Post Office;    and if they eventually adopted a resolution opposing the establishment of a State-owned Relay Service in their town it would not be too easy for the Post Office to disregard their views and to proceed with the scheme, apart from the effect of the dispute on the success of the trial service..     There is of course the alternative of choosing a town with a Labour majority on the Council, which might be expected to resist
7.resist the pressure of the wireless trade;    but if this f    course were followed there would doubtless be considerable criticism of the fact that the Government had had to select a Labour town in order to get its scheme tried. 15. There can be no doubt that the wireless trade - now -that it has realised the possibilities of the development of a Post Office service on a national scale - is much stronger in its opposition to the scheme than it was at the time of the publication of the Ullswater Report.    The National Chamber of Trade recently discussed the question and declared its unanimous opposition to the nationalisation of the Relay Services.   Unless the Government is prepared - in the event of a successful trial - to proceed with the scheme in spite of the strong opposition of trade interests, it becomes a question whether it is politic to proceed with a large-scale commercial experiment, particularly in view of the cost involved.    There would doubtless be less opposition to a Post Office scheme limited to the provision of a carrier frequency service to telephone subscribers;  and it might be possible to develop this as an alternative service even if Relay Services of the present type were left to private enterprise.   In any case it seems advisable that the Cabinet should review the whole question before the next step is taken. 16. In particular, attention should be drawn to theimportance of State control of wire broadcasting in time of war.    If the Government should decide to close down the wireless broadcasting service in time of war it would be of great value to have a wire  service over which official announcements, warnings and advice could be sent from a central
central point to a large number of homes.    At the present time there are 253,000 subscribers to Relay Services, representing only about 3 per cent of the total number of licensed listeners.    If a wire broadcasting service is to be an effective instrument in defence arrangements a much wider development would seem to be essential and a sufficiently rapid extension of the service would probably only be obtainable under nationalisation.    Progress under private enterprise is likely to be slow.    Under the existing system the Post Office has power to take over the Relay Services or to control the matter distributed, in time of national emergency.    These services are not, however, linked together in any way;  and although it would be possible, in connection with any further extension of licences, to make provision for such linking and joint use in time of emergency, arrangements on these lines would not provide such an efficient and extensive system for distribution of Government announcements as a wire broadcasting network established by the Post Office on a national scale., Reports have been received that the. German Governmenthave decided to establish a very extensive system of wire broadcasting, the.present programme contemplating the provision of 10,000,000 sets within the next two years.    It is not known whether this is primarily a war measure, or whether its main purpose is to help the Government in carrying out what is understood to be its peace-time policy of discouraging the German population from listening to foreign broadcasting stations.    The scheme is no doubt considered important from both points of view.    There has also been a report in the Press that loud speakers served by wire are to be erected in public places in German townsand
and villages in order to facilitate the reception of broadcast addresses, 18.   -      With regard to the finance of a Post Office wirebroadcasting service, no reliable estimate can be furnished in the absence&apos; of a large-scale trial.     From the investigations made, however, it is considered likely that the Post Office could run the service at a profit in towns such as those where Company-owned services have been established.      If, however, through public pressure or for reasons of policy, the Post Office had to extend the service to smaller towns, to villages and to rural areas, the profit might well be converted into a loss. 19. The present Relay Exchange licences are due to expireat the end of 1939;    and it was intended that the Government&apos;s decision should be announced a reasonable time -say 12 months - earlier.     If a large-scale trial is to be carried out it is clear that it will not yield results in time for the Government to announce a decision by the end of 1938;    and it would seem desirable in any case to extend the system of licensing private relay services for a further period - say to the end of 1942 - on the same terms as hitherto.     By that time rearmament work should be declining;    and the active development of wire broadcasting, if it be decided that it should be placed in the hands of the Post Office, would provide a means of finding employment for substantial numbers of men. 20. A decision of the Cabinet is desired on the followingp points:-(a) whether in the circumstances which have nowdeveloped - and having regard to the Government&apos;s intentions concerning wireless broadcasting in time of war - the Post Office should undertake acommercial
10.commercial trial of wire broadcasting;(b)  if so, whether such a trial might be undertaken, if need be, at a town where the Council has a Labour majority:(o) whether the existing system of licensing Company-owned Relay Services should be extended for a further period of years - say to the 31st December, 1942.If the Government is not prepared to authorise a trial such as is referred to in (a) and considers that the question of taking over the operation of the Relay Services should not be further pursued, the question arises:-(d) whether the Government is prepared to consider the provision by the Post Office of a carrier frequency service to telephone subscribers.(Initld) G.C.T.7 June, 1938.
