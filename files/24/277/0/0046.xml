THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.1.      The Cabinet will recollect that in December last the Prime Minister circulated a memorandum (C.P.307(37)) covering a Report of the Departmental Committee which he had appointed in fulfilment of an undertaking given in Parliament on 15th July,  1957,  &quot;to examine the practical aspects of the sugges-tion for a pension scheme for Members of Parliament, the necessary funds to be raised and -maintained by personal contributions from Members (whether compulsory or voluntary) without any charge to the taxpayer, and to report to me what are the various alternatives.      On receipt of this report I propose to consult further with representative Members of Parliament on the matter. &quot;2. After considering this Report, a cony of which is circula-ted herewith (cmd.. 5624), the Cabinet decided-(a) That the Prime Minister should arrange for the presentation to Parliament of the report of the Departmental Committee on Pensions for Members of the House of Commons:(b) That the Prime Minister should consult the Leadersof the Opposition Parties and such other Members of Parliament as he might deer.; advisable on the subject of the report.5.      In May last the Prime Minister invited me to undertake the task of sounding opinion in the House of Commons as agreed in conclusion (b), and I wish now to report to my colleagues the result of the inquiries I have made.4.      I first tried to ascertain the reactions to the Report of Government supporters in the House of Commons, and Sir-1-
Assheton-Pownall came with four other Members to express warm approval of the plan,  and indeed these Members (whom I had nothing to do with selecting) expressed the confident opinion that their view would be shared by the majority of Government supporters.      Subsequent information makes me doubt whether this is the case, at any rate at present.   Sir Hugh  0&apos;Heill, the Chairman of the 1922 Committee, caire to see me the other clay and told me that the Committee by a majority had expressed itself as opposed to the proposed scheme for pensions for ex-Members.      Indeed, he was positive that this would be the prevailing view of the Government side.      It nay be so at present,  though it opes not follow that on reflection and in the light of the wider considerations involved a great many of these Members would not change their attitude.5.      As regards the labour Party I found very general support for the Departmental Committee&apos;s scheme.      The only criticism which was at all pressed was in regard to the needs qualifica-tion.      The deputation represented that it might be unfair to penalise the thrifty Member who had acquired small savings or who had purchased his house- by reducing his pension proportion-ate ly as compared with a Member who had. saved nothing.      They therefore suggested that the first  100 of private means should not be taken into account,  a modification which would result in certain cases in bringing the total income of an ex-Member,  after allowing for the maximum pension award of  150, up to  250 a year.      For the rest,  the deputation expressed strong support for the scheme,  and I have recently had further evidence that the official Opposition would welcome its prompt adoption.
6.      The Opposition Liberals took a rather different attitude, but when I saw then they were at the disadvantage that they had not yet read the Departmental Committee^ Report.      They expressed a dislike for any test of need and said that they would prefer a scheme under which any Member could demand a pension as of right after a qualifying period of service in the House.      I explained to them that such a scheme was quite impossible actuarially, cuid they agreed that in view of this they would not wish to -prejudice matters by withholding their support from the Departmental Committee&apos;s scheme..      I have subsequently heard from thern that after studying the Departmental Committeefs Report they remain of. the same opinion, but equally they will be prepared to give their support for the Committee&apos;s scheme while sighing for something different.7..     The Independent labour Painty expressed their willing-ness to support the scheme in the absence of a better one, though they hankered after a State contribution and a larger number of awards.9...     My colleagues will see that so far as the Opposition Parties are concerned we can count on acquiescence if not full support for the scheme proposed by the Departmental Committee.      So far as the Government side is concerned we may find some measure of opposition.      The Chief Whip, however,  whom I have consulted,  do&amp;s not consider that Sir Hugh 0&apos;Neill&apos;s appreciation of the position is complete and he docs not anticipate serious vocal opposition to the proposal.      He advises that the legislation (which is required in view of the need for authority to deduct from every Member  12 a year) should be submitted to a free vote, but that we need anticipate no difficulty in getting it passed.      It will be appreciated that the alternative of
3 p. Adispensing with legislation and i -ntr-n^no. -nr a --voluntary pensions scheme would be impracticable,   (i) because it would be actuarially impossible to conduct a pensions scheme on such a basis,  (ii) because the Socialists would regard it as a proposal to provide a fund out of &quot;charity&quot;, and (iii) because many of our own supporters would consider that they were put in an invidious position.9.      A Bill is being prepared and will be circulated before Wednesday&apos;s Cabinet Meeting;      There are certain points in the draft Bill to which I should draw attention.(a) the persons to whom payments may be made are restricted to present and future Members of parliament (when they cease to be Members) and their widows.      There may be pressure to include past Members who have already left the House and dependants other than widows.      The argument against this course is that the v/feole arrangement . is novel and experimental and that experience must be gained before extensions are made.      The possibility of extension may well lie in the potential income from voluntary sources as to which no estimate can be formed.(b) Provision is made for the Trustees to be appointed by-the House of Commons.      The alternative of appointment by the Speaker has been considered but it is understood that he wouin prefer to stand coi^plctedv out-side these arrangements,(c) The limitations on the powers of Trusteed are set out in the First Schedule.      Clause 1 thereof will? admit of private resources to the extent of  75 per annum (in the case of an ex-M. P, ) and  50 p^r annum (in the case of a widow) being ignored by the Trustees if they think fit.      This is the only important respect  i1-1 which the scheme set out in the Bill departs from the recommenda-tions of the Committee.      The figure of  75 -corrroares with
the figure of  100 of permitted private i^esources suggested by the labour Party and should go a long way to meet their criticism,10.      The questions therefore are: -(l) Should the Bill be introduced and proceeded with?(2) Is  the draft Bill appropriate for the purpose? I hardly think that a reference to the Home Affairs Committee is necessary.(Intld. ) J. S.Treasury Chambers, S.W.  1. 3th July,  1953.

To The Right Honourable the Prime Minister.Sir,We were appointed by you to examine the practical aspects of the suggestion for a pension scheme for Members of Parliament, the necessary funds to be raised and maintained by personal con-tributions from Members (whether compulsory or voluntary) without any charge to the taxpayer, and to report to you what are the various alternatives. We have now the honour to submit the following Report.2. Certain Members of the House of Commons who have given special attention to the subject have been good enough to give us informally the benefit of their knowledge and to advise us of the considerations to which in their view any scheme should pay regard. We are greatly indebted to them for their assistance.3. Statistics of House of Commons Membership. It is evident that the financial aspects of any pension scheme for Members of the House of Commons can only be assessed by reference to ascertained facts. We have accordingly compiled, by collation of a number of sources, both official and non-official,* particulars of the age and duration of membership of ex-Members of the House of Commons whose membership terminated between 8th January, 1924 and 30th July, 1937. We did not consider that any useful purpose would be served by extending our statistical enquiry over a longer period. The period taken includes four completed Parliaments and the present Parliament to the beginning of the summer recess. Certain particulars for the present House as constituted at the latter date have also been compiled.Tables summarising these statistics are appended to our report.4. In Appendix I the composition of the House of Commons at 30th July, 1937, is shown in various ways. It will be seen that out of a total House of 614 Members (one bye-election being then* Among non-official sources we are particularly indebted to the Editor of Dod&apos;s Parliamentary Companion who was good enough to place at our disposal all his relevant records.(40045)
pending) 100 Members commenced their service in the present Parliament, 336 served continuously in more than one Parliament, and 178 served in more than one Parliament but with breaks, the duration of the break or breaks being nearly \\ years on average. To give some indication of the length of service, the last two columns divide the Members between those who had served up to 10 years, and those who had served for a longer period. Of the latter, representing over one-third of the House, at least 100 are over 60.5. In Appendix II an analysis is made of all persons who, having served at some time since 8th January, 1924, were not Members on 30th July, 1937. In Part I the figures are analysed according to number of times elected, years of membership, and age at termination. The. persons dealt with in the Table exclude those who after losing their seats have subsequently returned to Parlia-ment and were Members at 30th July, 1937. It will be appreciated that some proportion of the persons included, especially the younger, have not finished their Parliamentary career but will return to Parliament in due course.During the thirteen and a half years under review there have been 1,438 Members of Parliament, of whom 614 were sitting Members on 30th July, 1937. Of the remaining 824 whose member-ship had terminated, 309 had sat in one Parliament only, 157 in two, 93 in three, and the balance,&apos; namely 265, had been elected to Parliament four times or more. Analysing the terminations by years of membership, 427, i.e., over one-half, had had 5 years&apos; membership or less and 175 from 6 to 10 years. Of the remaining 222 who had been in the House for 11 years or more, one-half only, i.e., about one-eighth of the total number whose membership ter-minated in this period, had served for 16 years or over.6. In Part II of Appendix II all terminations after membership of two or more and three or more Parliaments respectively have been further classified under causes. The total numbers included are : Number of times elected.Terminations.Two or Three or more.        more.By Death..........By Peerages, Judgeships, Governorships,91 72etc.At Dissolutions -5953(i) seeking  but  not securing  re-(ii) not standing for re-election Others (during course of a Parliament)..election179 155 319S 113 22Totals all causes51535S
These figures may serve to indicate the field from which beneficiaries under a pension scheme would emerge. It has already been observed that some proportion, possibly substantial, of Members who lost their seats at general elections will sooner or later re-enter the House ; the terminations thus cannot be regarded in all cases as final terminations of Parliamentary membership. The reasons which led Members not to seek re-election are not known, but it is possible that the number may include some who were failing in health but who retained their membership until the dissolution and then decided not to seek re-election. Similarly, while the precise reason for retirement during the course of a Parliament is known in a few instances, in general it has not been possible to ascertain from the records used whether a particular resignation was due to ill-health, business reasons or other circumstances. The number of pensions which would have resulted under a variety of possible qualifications may be ascertained by reference to the Appendix. If, for example, a grant had been made to all Members who were over 60 years of age at termination, who had served in at least three Parliaments, and whose total membership was (a) eleven years and over, or (&amp;) six years and over, it will be seen that the total numbers fulfilling these alternative conditions were : At Dissolutions : 	(a)	(b)Not re-elected	29	41Not standing          . .       ..	49	68Other terminations (excluding Peerages,		Judgeships, Governorships, etc.)	S	9	86	1187. Unsuitability of schemes connected with pensionable employments. We have considered in the first instance the practicability of a scheme, on the analogy of those in force in many employments, whereby, in consideration of suitable contributions from all Members, a pension would be granted on termination of membership to each Member who satisfied such conditions as might be appropriate in regard to age and duration of membership. It is unnecessary to analyse all the differences between membership of the House. of Commons and employment of which a pension under prescribed conditions is one of the rewards. Fundamental characteristics of such pensionable employment are, however, firstly,, that in general it aims at attracting and retaining personnel for a large part of their working lives without any break and, secondly, that the date of retirement is normally determined in accordance with the require-ments of the employer, the benefits provided by the pension scheme being related to these circumstances. The bulk of the pensionable employees may accordingly be expected to satisfy the required conditions and receive an eventual pension. As the employment is of long duration, the cost of the pension is spread over many years ;
even on this basis the cost of a pension system is of the order of 10 to 15 per cent, of the average effective emoluments. Membership of the House of Commons on the other hand begins and ceases,at very varying ages and its duration may be no more than a few months or years, or may extend to several decades.This lack of homogeneity and the impossibility of predicting the average rate of cessation of membership in future preclude even approximate actuarial calculation of the probable cost of a pension system as generally understood, but it is clear that the individual contributions required to finance such a system would be extremely high in relation to a given rate of pension. With heavy contributions, provision would presumably have to be included, in accordance with the usual practice of contributory pension systems, for the return of their contributions to Members whose membership ceased in circumstances which did not qualify them for pension. It follows that the pensions of those Members who satisfied the prescribed conditions would have to be provided by their own contributions. The duration of membership would vary greatly even as between such Members. If the scheme provided for a flat rate of pension, those Members who had longest service would be paying in part for the pensions of the remainder ; if the pension varied with duration of membership, the system would in effect amount to the return to each such Member of his own contributions in the form of an annuity.8. The benefits obtainable under a contributory scheme of this type, allowing for the return of contributions in cases of termina-tion of membership before attainment of the pension age, vary widely according to the ages at which the contracts are effected and the age at which the pension starts. The following statement shows the average of the annual premiums required by eight of the leading insurance companies under policies taken out at various ages for deferred annuities commencing at ages 60 and 65 :-Age next birthday at entry.		Annual premium for annuity of ^100 commencing at age : 				60	65			    s. d.		        *-30		24 16   8		16   8   440		44 12   6		27 13   450		106   8   4		55   3   4The annual premiums at ages over 50 at entry increase very rapidly, and, in the extreme case of a Member aged 60, the provision of an annuity of  100 commencing at that age would involve a lump sum payment of about  1,230.   Again, the immediate value
of an annuity of  100 commencing at 65 is about  1,040. In its application to the older existing Members of the House, therefore, a contributory pension scheme of this type would either require contributions of prohibitive amount, or result in such meagre pensions as to be of little use. Arrangements of this nature, more-over, would involve considerable difficulty when membership is interrupted and the ex-Member is unable to continue his contribu-tions. We therefore conclude that a scheme in which the pension is related in each case to the Member&apos;s own contributions would be unsuitable.9. French Parliamentary Pension Scheme. Our attention has been drawn to a contributory pension scheme which is in force in the French Parliament. The scheme is described in outline in Appendix III to this Report. It appears from such accounts of the fund as are available that an Exchequer subsidy is involved. At the present time this subsidy has reached approximately two-thirds of the annual contributions of the Members, but we have no informa-tion as to its probable ultimate level. As it has been laid down in connection with the proposal for the institution of a Pension scheme for the House of Commons that no liability should be imposed on the taxpayer, the French scheme lies outside otir terms of reference and does not afford a useful precedent.10. Members&apos; Fund. We next turned to a suggestion which had been made by a number of Members of Parliament that a House of Commons Members&apos; Fund could be instituted, contributions to which would be fixed at a moderate level while the grant of pensions on termination of service would be confined by a process of selection to a sufficient^ small number of beneficiaries to enable sums of reasonable amount to be available for ex-Members of long Parlia-mentary service who on cessation of membership had passed the age for renewed employment and who had not adequate means of financial support. In our view a scheme of this sort is both practi-cable and suited to the very special circumstances which require to be taken into account. On the one hand, the majority of Members do not require financial provision to be made for them after the conclusion of their membership. On the other, it is found that in a certain number of cases a Member who has spent many years in Parliament is unable after the cessation of his Parliamentary salary to support himself in the most modest manner which comports with the dignity of that Institution. It is with such cases that the suggested Fund is intended to deal.11. Before a scheme of this sort is adopted, decisions will have to be taken on the following matters : (i) The extent of the field from which contributions are to be drawn and the amount of those contributions.(ii) The qualifications to be prescribed as to age and service as a condition for the grant of a pension.
(iii) The measure of discretion in the administration of the scheme to be conferred on the managing body; this body might either be required to apply without deviation the quali-fications and rules laid down or be subject only to a general observance of such qualifications and rules as guiding principles, or again the administration of the available funds might be left to its sole discr       without any limitation.(iv) The amount of pension to be granted, e.g., whether it should be a uniform flat rate of a prescribed amount or such pension as would bring the income of the ex-Member to that amount.(v) The reconsideration of the amount of the pension either in the light of. a change in the financial circumstances of the recipient, or in the light of the resources of the Fund.(vi) The inclusion of power to make non-recurrent grants to ex-Members who are not eligible for pension under the pre-scribed conditions, either pending an election or in other circumstances.(vii) The inclusion of power to grant pensions to widows or other dependants of ex-Members, and if so the amount of such pensions.(viii) The date from which the scheme should become effective for the purpose of award of pensions and the definition of its scope as regards persons who had already ceased to be Members of the House at that date.12. Contributions. The first of the foregoing matters, namely, the extent of the field from which contributions are to be drawn and the amount of the contributions is all important. The decisions upon it will very largely influence the settlement of the further points which arise. The difficulties of forecasting impending calls upon the Fund and of administering its available resources to the best advantage will in any case be great. Apart therefore from any other objection which might be felt to reliance on optional contribu-tions, the necessity of assuring to the management of the Fund a known and permanent income over an indefinite period points, as a practical measure, to placing a statutory obligation on aU Members of the House of Commons to contribute to the Fund.13. As to the amount of the contribution, our investigations lead us to believe that a contribution of  12 a year, involving a levy by deduction from salaries of an exact  1 a month, would be generally acceptable and that it would not raise questions of the return of their contributions to Members not personally benefiting from the Fund. We have accordingly taken this figure as a basis for the calculations below. With a House of 615 Members, it pro-duces an income of some  7,000 per annum when allowance is made for temporarily vacant seats and for intervals between Parliaments.
14. Finance, scope and benefits. The question arises whether (a) the total amount received from contributions in any year should, in general, be regarded as available for expenditure on pensions in that year, thus leaving the amount ot new pensions granted in any future year to be governed by the excess of contribution receipts in that future year over the existing pension charges, or whether (6) an accumulated fund should be maintained, sufficient reserves being held at any time to secure the continuance of pensions already granted for the remainder of the life-time of existing beneficiaries, the income from future contributions being thus fully available for future grants. While the income may be expected to remain more or less constant, the annual pension charge must necessarily grow continuously over a very long period from the outset of the scheme. It would therefore be unsound to regard the whole income received in the early years as available for immediate distribution to the first pensioners. It is important that once a pension is granted the recipient should be able to look forward with reasonable certainty to its continuance at the amount fixed, and that pensions should not be liable to be reduced in consequence of demands on the Fund on behalf of new beneficiaries.We are accordingly of opinion that in the grant of pensions regard must always be had to their capital value. In other words, the total amount received in contributions during any Parliament should be treated as representing, in effect, the sum available for the purchase of annuities. With an annual income of  7,000, representing about  25,000 during a Parliament of average duration, wexestimate on certain assumptions, the more important of which are indicated below, that it would not be prudent to award new pensions involving an annual charge of more than about one-tenth of the latter sum for cases selected in respect of the Parliament in question. Our fraction of one-tenth is related to the estimated average cost of the pensions, namely about ten years&apos; purchase.By this plan, a fund would be accumulated which, apart from fluctuations, would always be sufficient to continue the existing pensions. Future income from contributions would thus not be diverted to the maintenance of grants already made but would be wholly available for the provision of further new pensions. In the course of time, as fresh grants are made, and pensions cease on death, the annual expenditure on pensions, starting from a very small figure in the first year, would gradually grow on this basis until it exceeded the annual contribution receipts by a substantial amount which would be met by the interest on the accumulated fund.It is, of course, impossible to forecast what the probable number of cases to be met from the Fund would be, and indeed it has not been possible to ascertain with any precision how many pensions might have been required during the period 1924 to 1937, if a Fund had then been in existence.   We have, however, made certain(40045) a*
calculations as to the extent of assistance in the form of pensions which the Fund could afford, and for the purpose we have madethe following assumptions : -(i) that eligibility for pensions will be confined to present and future Members who have had considerable Parliamentary experience, measured either in years of Parliamentary service (e.g., ten years) or by the number of times they have been returned, and who, except in cases of breakdown of health, are over 60 years of age at the date of termination of service ;. .     - (ii) that pensions on termination of membership owing to ill ... health before the age of 60 will be a small proportion of the whole;        .&apos;(hi).that the pension will be such amount as is required to -bring the income from all sources of the ex-Member up to  150 a year ; c(iv) that grants to dependants will be confined to the award of pensions to widows of ex-Members who die while in receipt&apos;of a. pension or of Members who would themselves have been eligible -for pension ; and(v) that the pension to a widow will be such amount as is required to bring her income from all sources up to  75 a year.The resources of the Fund, based on the suggested compulsory contribution of  1 a month, would enable the provision of about eighteen awards on average to ex-Members and their widows during the course of each Parliament if the full pension on the rates mentioned above was needed in each case, the position being proportionately improved if, owing to private means, full pensions were not always required.A material relaxation of the minimum age assumed in the above calculations would involve a reduction either in the number or in the amount of awards. The criteria of eligibility adopted would, of course, have an important bearing on the finances. If, for example, membership of three Parliaments were taken as the criterion without further qualifications regarding duration of membership, it is right to point out that in the event of a number of Parliaments being of unusually short duration the administering body would need to exercise caution in continuing to regard this as a standard.15, As regards discretion in the administration of the scheme, while a measure of definition of the general qualifying standards to be observed is essential in whatever scheme is adopted,&apos; if only to safeguard the solvency of the Fund, the circumstances of a Parliamentary career appear to preclude complete rigidity in the application of such tests. It may well happen that an ex-Member, possibly in circumstances of considerable hardship, may fail to satisfy one of the tests by a small margin while amply satisfying others. It will probably, therefore, be considered desirable, while laying down guiding principles, to confer a measure of discretion on the administering body.
16. The mortality experience among this small group of pensioners may well prove to be subject to considerable fluctuation. In addition to the maintenance of a Fund on a basis normally adequate to provide for the continuance of all pensions already granted, it would, therefore, be desirable to accumulate from the outset an additional reserve of reasonable amount to cover this contingency and to provide for the further possibility that claims on the Fund might mature more rapidly or in larger numbers than could be forecast. It will no doubt be desired, as we have suggested, that when an award has once been made the beneficiary should be able to look forward with assurance to its continuance at the same rate unless his financial circumstances improve. It would seem important also that the awards made in the early years should not be on such a liberal scale as to jeopardise the hope of dealing similarly with claimants in the future. There would no doubt be some variations from year to year in the number of new pensions granted, and a peak might perhaps be expected after a.General Election. The annual charge on the Fund would grow for many years and a considerable period would elapse before the expenditure reached its ultimate level. There would be a corresponding growth in the accumulated fund, which, as we have already pointed out, should at any time be sufficient to continue to the then existing pensioners the payment of their pensions throughout the remainder of their lifetime without further recourse to the contribution receipts. On the assumptions made above as to the number of pensions granted the accumulated fund will ultimately reach a total in excess of  50,000. It is evident that in a scheme under which the grant of pensions is elastic, not only as regards the amount of award but also the age at which it commences and other matters, the assessment of future liabilities can only be measured on somewhat broad fines. Actuarial valuations of the Fund should, however, be made at periodical intervals, say every five years, to ascertain its progress and to ensure that the proper relationship is maintained between the liabilities and the assets.17. Donations and bequests. It is probable that once a Fund of this character has been instituted, it will attract substantial dona-tions and bequests over and above the statutory contributions which constitute its secure income. Such has been the experience of other foundations, and in view of the prestige of the body with which this Fund will be associated and the corporate spirit characteristic of the House of Commons, the additional revenues so made available for the objects of the Fund may eventually be large. We are obviously not in a position to take account in our calculations of any such problematical income.18. Possible extension to other benefits. We have assumed that the Fund will be primarily intended for and devoted to the grant of pensions. Experience alone will show whether it will have sufficient margin to permit on occasion of non-recurrent grants to ex-Members who are not eligible for a pension and whose circumstances warrant
such grants. The possibilities of such extension will no doubt be clearer after the first quinquennial valuation. It may therefore be considered desirable to give the administering body a certain discretion in this matter.19. Existing Ex-Members. In the preceding paragraphs we have dealt with the case of present and future Members of the House on the assumption that the scheme would come into operation on the date on which contributions first became payable. The question arises whether the benefits of the scheme should be extended to persons who had already ceased to be Members. The award of pensions to such persons might represent quite substantial liabilities. We cannot advise that the Fund would be able to support such liabilities on any appreciable scale out of the normal contribution receipts.. We have referred above to the possibility that the Fund may benefit by donations and bequests in addition to the statutory contributions, and have stated that no account has been taken of such sums in our estimates. It would be a matter for consideration as to how far such unhypothecated income particularly such as might conceivably enure at the start of the scheme might be applied for the benefit of persons who had already terminated their membership of the House.20. Legislation and management. Contributions can only be made compulsory by legislation. The necessary statute will presumably require to define in general terms the objects and scope of the Fund to which the contributions are paid ; it will however probably not be desired to limit them at all narrowly. It will also have to lay down the machinery by which the Fund is to be operated.It may be desirable to have : (a) a Custodian Trustee to receive and invest the Members&apos; contributions and other moneys coming to the Fund and to make all payments out of the capital or income of the Fund. The Custodian Trustee should be permanent preferably a body corporate already entitled to act as custodian trustee by rales made under the Public Trustee Act, 1906. The Custodian Trustee will have sole custody of all money and securities. He will, upon the direction of the Committee of Management who will act as Managing Trustees, pay such pensions and grants as they may award. He wilt invest in his own name all moneys requiring investment and vary investments as and when and (subject to the investment clause) in the manner directed by the Committee and will receive the interest thereon. Pro-vision should be made authorizing the Custodian Trustee to act upon directions purporting to be signed by or on behalf of the Committee ;(b) a number of Managing Trustees, who will be the Com-mittee of Management, and who will undertake the general management of the Fund, decide what grants should be made,
and give all necessary directions to the Custodian Trustee. The members of this Committee will necessarily be Members of the House of Commons. They can presumably be appointed by an Order of the House, the composition of the Committee being settled through the usual channels, at the beginning of each Parliament, for the duration of that Parliament, subject to the replacement of any members of the Committee who cease meantime to be members of the House of Commons. We should point out that if on a dissolution the Committee of Management came to an end, there would be an interval before the appointment of the new Committee, during which, while the Trustee could continue to carry out the instructions pre-viously given, it would not be possible to make fresh awards. It may be desired to bridge this interval by continuing the Committee in being until the re-assembly of the next Parlia-ment.Applications to the Committee would no doubt in general be made by ex-Members through the Leader of the Party to which the Member had belonged and any relevant facts could be ascertained by the Committee through such Leader without the necessity of resorting to personal interviews.The collection by deduction from Members&apos; salaries of the fixed contribution if authorised by Statute can be effected by existing machinery, and it should be possible to provide in considerable measure any secretarial and clerical assistance required by the Trustee or Committee of Management without extra cost to public funds or charge against the Fund. The Statute should, however, give power to employ and remunerate from the Fund such staff as may be required, and to defray any incidental expenses incurred.The investment powers of the Trustee will require to be defined. In a case of this kind a completely open investment clause might, we conceive, be a source of embarrassment. On the other hand it may be felt that in the circumstances surrounding this scheme, in particular the fact that the Fund is derived from Members&apos; sub-prescriptions, some extension of the classes of securities in which trustees may invest under Section 1 of the Trustee Act, 1925, may be justified. We suggest for consideration in this connection Clause 12 of the Government of India (Family Pensions Funds) Order, 1936, made under the Government of India Act, 1935, by which the powers of investment of the Commissioners of the Funds under the Order are prescribed. The Clause is reproduced as Appendix IV to this Report.It is usual in the case of superannuation funds established in connection with trade or industry for contributions to the fund to be allowed as deductions for Income Tax (and Sur-tax) purposes from the income of the contributors and for the income of any invested fund to be exempt from Income Tax.   We think that any scheme
such as we have described should enjoy similar treatment and we suggest that steps should be taken by means of a provision in the Finance Act next following the initiation of the scheme to give the scheme the same exemption privileges.21. It would no doubt be desired that the accounts of the Trustee, including the annual account of the Fund, should be audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General. Subject to the exclusion therefrom of all names of beneficiaries, the audited accounts and the Report of the Auditor thereon should be required to be presented to the House of Commons. Provision should be included accordingly in the Statute.It would probably be desired also that the actuarial valuations of the Fund, which we have suggested should be made quinquennially, should be carried out by the Government Actuary, who would of course be available at any time to give such actuarial advice as might be required. Any valuation of the Fund should be required to be presented to the House of Commons.I have the honour to be, Sir,Your obedient Servant,.   N. F.

APPENDIX III Outline of French Parliamentary Scheme A contributory pensions scheme is in force for members of the Lower House&apos; of the French Parliament. The rates of contribution and benefits payable under the scheme have been varied from time to time. The following figures relate to the present time. The Parliamentary salary at the current rate of exchange is about  440 per annum. In return for compulsory con-tributions of about  24 per annum in the 4 years following his first election and  12 per annum thereafter a&apos; pension is payable as of right at age 55, varying according to the number of years&apos; membership from an annual pension of about  55 after 8 years&apos; membership to about  139 after 28 years&apos; membership. In addition, a pension is payable at half the appropriate rate to the widow of a member who has satisfied the prescribed qualifications and who dies, whether before or after commencing to draw pension,, together with orphans&apos; allowances of one-twentieth of the member&apos;s rate for each child during minority.Members have the &quot;option to pay twice the above rates of contribution and in return to receive approximately double the above benefits. Pensions are not payable during membership of either House.A Member under pension age who fails to retain his seat at an election, or one who becomes a Member of the Upper House, must continue to pay contributions to maintain his pension rights, but if he has contributed on the higher scale he may continue payment on the lower with appropriate modifications of pension.APPENDIX IVSTATUTORY RULES AND ORDERS, 1936No. 1310, Clause 12The Commissioners shall invest so much of the funds respectively in their hands as is available for investment in such securities as they think fit, being either (a) securities in which a trustee may invest trust moneys under the powers of section one of the Trustee Act, 1925, as extended by any subsequent enactment; or(b) the stocks, funds, bonds, mortgages, debentures or securities of any public body incorporated in the United Kingdom by or under any Act of Parliament or of the Parliament of Northern Ireland ; or(c) the bonds, mortgages, debentures, debenture or rent-charge stock of any railway, gas, electric light or power company in the United Kingdom ; or(d) the preference stock or shares of any such gas, electric light or power company which has paid a dividend on its ordinary stock or shares at a rate of not less than three per cent, during each of the five years immediately preceding the date of the investment,and may, as and when they think fit, realise, convert or otherwise deal with any such securities : Provided that (i) the proviso to subsection (1) of section two of the Trustee Act, 1925 (which restricts the purchase by trustees of securities standing at a premium) shall not apply to the Commissioners ;(ii) the Commissioners shall not invest in real securities in the Irish Free State, or in the stock of the Bank of Ireland.(39822)   (40045)   Wt. 1854/1124   2000   12/37   Hw.
