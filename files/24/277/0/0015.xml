I said that the Secretary of State had been turning this question over in his mind and was inclined to think that Dr. Benes, if a plebiscite was likely to become a live issue, would be wiser to offer the Sudeten Germans a plebiscite now than to have to grant it later on under threat of force.3. As the Secretary of State saw the question, we had turned the first corner, but the main problem still awaited, solution. Suppose the negotiations between the Czechoslovak Government and the Sudeten Germans were to break down and there were further incidents, what, would be the next step ? &quot;We did not want to get into the position of endorsing Dr. Benes&apos; plan (however good it might be) and then having to run away from it because the Germans rejected it and became violent again. If Dr. Benes offered what he thought a good plan and Herr Henlein rejected it, there would be a confused and possibly a dangerous situation.4.   In these circumstances the best standing ground for Dr. Benes and for ourselves might be the early offer of a plebiscite.   Such a plebiscite might take place immediately, or after a given period of years; the Secretary of State thought 9899   [17316] b
an immediate plebiscite preferable, since with a deferred plebiscite the parties would be manoeuvring for position during the whole interim period. Thus, Dr. Benes might offer what he regarded as a maximum plan of concessions, and if this plan were refused, he might offer a plebiscite on the two questions : (1) acceptance of the plan;(2) union with Germany.5. The argument to use with Dr. Benes would be that we had missed trouble on this occasion, perhaps by a small margin. Neither Czechoslovakia, nor Trance, nor Great Britain, were on a good wicket.if there was trouble. Dr. Benes&apos;s best chance of preserving an independent Czech State would be along the lines of (1) a plebiscite, (2) neutrality (I said the Foreign Office were studying both these questions). Dr. Benes would no doubt ask what guarantees he would receive either (1) for the rump, in the event of a plebiscite favourable to Germany, or (2) for the integral State, in the event of a plebiscite unfavourable to Germany. The answer must be that no such guarantees can be offered, so far as we are concerned. All that could be said would be that Czechoslovakia would have a better chance of survival as a neutralised State after a plebiscite than at present, since the so-called provocative elements in her situation and policy would have been removed.6. There were, of course, the obvious difficulties about a plebiscite; how to frame the questions; how to delimit the polling area; how to ensure a free vote  e.g., foreign troops. There was also the question whether the German Govern-ment would want a free plebiscite-they liked to run their own plebiscites. But these could be left aside for the moment. The question to consider was whether we should advise Dr. Benes &quot;to accompany his final offer with the offer of a plebiscite. The Sudeten Germans would always be a troublesome element and it might be better to have them (or the bulk of them) outside the State than inside it.&apos;: 7. The Secretary of State would see no harm if Mr.,Newton thought fit to explore&apos; this: suggestion in Prague on a purely personal basis. Meanwhile, the Secretary of State was considering whether to broach it with the French Ambassador and the Czechoslovak Minister.1 .8. Mr. Newton said that it would be difficult for him to broach this question on a purely personal basis. The dividing line between the personal and the official had now become almost non-existent, and if he mentioned the question at all it would certainly be assumed that he was speaking with official authority. He would prefer to wait a bit until we could instruct him further. He had hitherto avoided this subject altogether.9. He recalled that he had   recently made some observations that were material to this question in his despatch No. 127 of the 16th May.10. There were two main problems facing us: (1) the Sudeten German question, (2) the question of Czechoslovakia^ foreign relations. It was important &quot;to remember that; even if there were not a single German in Czechoslovakia, the root problem of German-Czech relations would still remain, viz., a Slav State thrust into the heart of Germany, and having treaties of mutual assistance with powerful States East and West. On the other hand, if the problem of Czechoslovakia&apos;^ foreign relations could be satisfactorily solved &quot;from Germany&apos;s point of view, the sting would be taken out of the Sudeten German question. The German Government were not moved by racial considerations alone indeed, the Reich Germans rather despise the Sudeten Germans as inferior members of the .race. They are using the Sudeten German question as an instrument of policy, to strengthen their political and military position. They want in the first place to expel the Soviet Union from Central Europe, and, indeed, to deny the use of Czechoslovak territory to any other great Power. At the back of their minds-though this is never talked about must be the fact that, as the map will show, the direct road from Berlin to&quot; Vienna lies through Prague, and the way from Silesia to Austria lies across the narrow neck of Czechoslovakia.11. This, Mr. Newton thought, had a bearing on the question of a plebiscite. He was doubtful whether the Reich really wanted to incorporate the German fringe of Bohemia and Moravia within itself. The German Government well prefer to leave the Sudeten Germans where they were and to exercise predominant
political and economic influence over Bohemia and Moravia, which would become a kind of vassal State. This was the importance, from Germany&apos;s point of view, of severing Czechoslovakia&apos;s special relations with Soviet Russia and France. The German Government might even be opposed to the dismemberment of Slovakia for the benefit of Poland and Hungary, since if Czechoslovakia remained intact under German influence, Slovakia would provide a corridor for Germany eastwards towards Roumania, which would be blocked if Poland and Hungary annexed it between them.12. If there were a plebiscite, where was the frontier to be drawn ? . What was to be done with the numerous Czech population in the. German, area, and the numerous German population in the rest of Bohemia and Moravia?13. It was possible that the Sudeten German question was really a side-show and that, as would appear from Mm Kampf, the real thrust . of German territorial expansion lay eastwards. Germany might perhaps be satisfied (1) if the Sudeten Germans enjoyed self-administration, including the profession and practice of Nazi principles, (2) if Czechoslovakia^ foreign relations could be regulated in the direction of neutralisation. If this result could be achieved, the Reich Germans might take less interest in the Sudeten Germans (whom they regard as rather poor specimens) and tell them to be quiet. It might well be that Germany was aiming at establishing political and economic influence over the territories of the late Austro-Hungarian Empire rather than at dismembering or disrupting them.14. In any event, it was, he thought, true to say that the Sudeten Germans thought and felt themselves to some extent to be Bohemian. There was much to be said for leaving the economic unit of Bohemia and Moravia intact, provided that Czechoslovakia^ foreign commitments could be abrogated.15. There might well be an element of bluff in Herr Henlein&apos;s threat to ask for a plebiscite; and to that extent there might be some point at a suitable moment-^-in falling the bluff by offering a plebiscite. What was pretty clear,, however, whatever Herr Henlein&apos;s own views might be, was that the rank and file of the Sudeten population, who were still exhilarated by the A nschluss, wanted to join up with the Reich, and a plebiscite would go overwhelmingly in favour of incorporation.16. It was very doubtful, of course, whether the Sudeten Germans could become loyal and contented citizens of Czechoslovakia. But Mr. Newton thinks the experiment is worth trying. If it were in the interests of the Reich Govern-ment that the Sudeten Germans should behave themselves, and if their own economic interests should work in the same direction, the situation might settle down and in time might stabilise itself. Time might do a good deal to solve this question.17. The Czechs themselves would probably prefer (1) self-administration for the Sudeten Germans, together with (2) neutralisation of the Czechoslovak State, to a plebiscite with dismemberment. The Czechs have very strong feelings for the Czech population in the German districts on the frontier, and regard them as the pioneers or vanguard of the Czech idea on the racial frontier between German and Slav. The General Staff would also, according to the /Military Attache, be strongly opposed to dismemberment. Not only would they be giving up a good military frontier, on the fortification of which immense sums have been spent, but they have the sense of domination and wish to keep the German population within the State. The Czechs would also regard with horror any exchange of population between the German and Czech areas; this is one of the difficulties, since the populations are so mixed that no plebiscite could give a clear-cut territorial result. Mr. Newton is inclined to think, therefore, that it would be better to avoid this kind of surgical operation if possible and to aim at the maintenance of the mixed State, even though it would fall within the German economic and political orbit.18.   There are, of course, people who think that the Czechs would fight rather than agree either to a plebiscite or to concessions in the internal and external sphere tantamount to vassalage, though I do not remember that Mr. Newton or any of his staff committed themselves to an opinion on this [17316] b 2
point. But&apos; concessions of this nature would almost certainly bring about changes of: Government in : Czechoslovakia and much: inter rial disturbance, including perhaps the resignation of the President himself.&apos; &apos;  &quot; ;19 Mr. Newton suggested, finally, that the feasibility of a plebiscite might toe one of the matters referred for report to the British investigator, if one were despatched by His Majesty&apos;s Government.&apos; ; Appointment of an Observer or of a Commission of Investigation orEnquiry.20. I had a discussion on this subject with His Majesty&apos;s Minister on the morning of the 27th May, in the course of which the following possible alternative courses were examined. The Military Attache (Colonel StrOnge) and Mr. Troutbeck, First Secretary of the Legation, were present.I.21. The simplest plan would be for His Majesty&apos;s Government to appoint an investigator (who might be accompanied by secretarial staff), whose first duty would be to tour the Sudeten country and submit to His Majesty&apos;s Government a first-hand review of the existing situation as a special supplement to the reports from His Majesty&apos;s Minister and His Majesty&apos;s Consul at Liberec. He might toe assisted in his enquiries by His Majesty&apos;s Consul at Liberec. It would be open to the investigator to submit any suggestions for a solution that might occur to him, and he could report on the feasibility of any proposal that might be referred to him by His Majesty&apos;s Government.22. His second duty would toe, with the assistance of His Majesty&apos;s Consul at Liberec, and, if need be, of the Military Attache&quot;, to enquire into and report on any incidents affecting the German population that might occur during his stay in the country.23. His Majesty&apos;s Minister thinks it quite possible that the Czechoslovak Government would welcome such an appointment. They have a good conscience so far as the occurrence of incidents are concerned, and an impartial enquiry would in any event serve as a corrective to German propaganda^ They would not be sorry to see us interesting ourselves to this increased extent in the sudeten problem, since they would feel that we were thereby committing ourselves more definitely in the business, and this-after the line we took in Berlin during the crisis of last week-end-would, in their view, toe all to the good.- They might also think that if the investigator made any proposals for a solution, these would in all probability be less extreme than the maximum demands of the Henlein Party.24. His Majesty&apos;s Minister thinks that this proposal is worth consideration. In the present situation it is possible that there is advantage in doing something rather than doing nothing, particularly if the particular form of activity meets with the. approval of both sides. He quite realises that if we appoint an investigator we shall be committing ourselves more directly&apos;than before; but he feels that this is inevitable in any case (only to-day, for example, we have for the first time approached the Czechoslovak G overnment as regards the disbandment of the extra effectives called up last, week-end, a duty we have hitherto left to the French), and that if we are to intervene more directly in the future than in the past, it is desirable that we should be as well informed as possible. There is the further point that if the effort to start negotiations between the Sudeten : Germans, and the Government should fail, or if once started they should break down,. His Majesty&apos;s Governrhent would be in a better position to play the honest broker if they had first-hand arid up-to-date information in their possession. The person chosen should, of course, know German well, and should toe of a sceptical turn of mind and proof against propaganda. A senior and experienced Consular officer who has not served in either Germany or Czechoslovakia might fill the-bill.

He quite idealises that if we appoint an investigator we shall be committing ourselves more directly than before; but he feels that this is inevitable in any case (only to-day, for example, we have for the first time approached the Czechoslovak Government as regards the disbandment of the extra effectives called up last week-end, a duty we have hitherto left to the French), and that if we are to intervene more directly in the future than in the past, it is desirable that we should be as well informed as possible.

The person chosen should, of course, know German well, and should be of a sceptical turn of mind and proof against propaganda. A senior and experienced Consular officer who has not served in either Germany or Czechoslovakia might fill the-bill.
25. Colonel Stronge suggests that in the event of an incident, involving Czechoslovak troops, he himself should be deputed to investigate the incident, if he has time to do so. He would in that event, he says, necessarily, be accompanied by a Czechoslovak Staff officer. ,    ,..26. Mr. Newton will not sound the Czechoslovak. Government about this pending further instructions. It will be desirable to sound the French Govern-ment before he does so.27. This proposal has the advantage that it could be put into effect fairly quickly; and could be adopted as a preliminary measure in advance of the alternative courses examined below.II.28. Another possibility is that His Majesty&apos;s Government should appoint a commission of enquiry composed either of British subjects or of &quot;neutrals&quot; or of both, with the definite instruction to propose a solution of the Sudeten German question and to prepare a plan after investigation on the spot, as well as to investigate any incidents that might occur during its stay in the country.29. We could either (a) have this proposal ready up our sleeve for use in the event of a deadlock between the Sudeten Germans and the Czechoslovak Government, with the threat of further incidents;&apos; or (6) let it be known at once that we should propose some such plan if the negotiations should break down.30. This second plan is, of course, a much more serious matter than the first, and is in the nature of an arbitration.31. It would, however, be in keeping with the leading part we have played in this question since the beginning, and we might well argue that we cannot form a judgment on the issues involved unless there is a special investigation on the spot.32.   It is open to a number of objections.33. It involves us very deeply in the affair; yet it may be that no solution will be found unless we can exercise our influence to the utmost. One of its effects might be to stiffen the attitude of the Czechs vis-a-vis the Sudeten Germans in the current negotiations, since they might reasonably calculate that a neutral commission Avould recommend a solution more favourable to themselves than they a,re likely to get face to face with the Sudeten Germans with the strength of the Reich behind them. Finally, this proposal could hardly commend itself to the German Government, who regard the Sudeten German question as one to be settled by Henlein (which means the German Government) and the Czechoslovak Government direct, and as one which they regard as their own affair and no concern of outsiders except in so far as outsiders can persuade the Czechs to give the Germans wha.t they want. The German Government will; no doubt, think that the Sudeten Germans (with their help) can get better terms for themselves than would be offered to them by a neutral commission.III.34. A third alternative would be a Commission appointed jointly by His Majesty&apos;s Government and the German Government, for the same purpose as the Commission in II, with terms of reference agreed upon by the two Governments.35. His Majesty&apos;s Minister thinks that the Czechoslovak Government might well accept this proposal, since they will pay attention to almost any advice we offer them in present circumstances.36. As for the German Government, they might, as suggested above, regard this plan also as an unwarranted interference on our part. On the other hand, they might feel that they would by this means secure a large concession with bur
blessing and as a result of Anglo-German collaboration, without prejudice to their securing further concessions by their own methods within a short period there-after. The first step taken in&quot; concert with us would make the subsequent steps easier to take.IV.37. Finally, if it is clear that no accommodation between the Sudeten Germans and the Government is possible, there may be a case for calling an inter-national conference on Czechoslovakia, attended by the Powers chiefly concerned, with a view to the despatch of an international commission, under the auspices of the conference, to recommend a solution. The German Government, again, would be unlikely to assent, and if they did not, the Italian Government would probably take the same line. But the proposal, even if rejected, might have a restraining influence; and if accepted, might bring about a solution-.V.38. There remains the proposal different in character from those outlined above made by Mr. Noel Baker in his question in the House of Commons on the 26th May, namely, for an international commission to visit the German-Czecho-slovak fronter in order to investigate violations of that frontier.39. These, of course, unlike those referred to in preceding sections, would be international incidents and not internal incidents like those affecting the Sudeten German population.40. It would be difficult to investigate such incidents on the Czechoslovak side of the frontier alone and the German Government would be unlikely to admit the Commission on to German territory.41. In any event, such incidents have not so far proved to be very dangerous, though they might easily become so. One form of violation which if it occurs on a substantial scale might cause trouble is the penetration of aircraft across the frontier for purposes of reconnaissance.Miscellaneous.(a) The Czech Attitude.42. It does not appear that the passing of the immediate crisis has lessened the realisation on the Czech side that something drastic must be done. Responsible Ministers like MM. Hodza and Krofta are, Mr. Newton thinks, no less convinced of this than before. Indeed, the crisis which involved military measures on the part of Czechoslovakia has bi*ought a keener sense of the seriousness of the position.  Czechoslovakia is at last face to face with a crisis in her fate.43. It was obvious that both among the people at large and in governing circles the action we took in Berlin last week-end should have acquired the highest significance. The fact that we acted at all, and at this precise moment, has made a deep impression. We are, naturally, regarded as having committed ourselves, morally at any rate, to intervene if there is a European war, and nothing that we are likely to say will remove that impression. Though the words we may have used were the same as those of the Prime Ministers speech of the 24th March, a much deeper impression has been made in Europe at large by Sir N. Henderson&apos;s demarche than by the speech itself.44. The news was passed round very quickly. The Italian Minister in Prague knew the same day substantially what Sir N. Henderson had said to Herr von Ribbentrop. It is impossible to keep these things secret, and this led Mr. Newton to observe to me that there are limits to the extent to which we can go in saying one thing in Prague and another in Berlin.45. The warning we gave in Berlin has had one good effect, among others, in Prague. It has greatly increased our influence. Since we have (in Czech- eyes) been better than our word, the Czechoslovak Government will be more inclined to trust us and to take our advice in future. The same, of course, is true of Paris. If we had not spoken as- we did in Berlin, it would have been more difficult for the French Government to speak as strongly as they did in Prague.
1.8946. Mr.. Newton strongly repudiates the suggestion that Dr. Benes would rather have a war than make generous concessions. He regards this kind of talk -as irresponsible and malicious. He thinks that our representations have had a very great effect on Dr. Benes and the two Ministers to whom they were made. Our words have carried greater weight both in Prague and in Berlin than those of the French, and our position has been strengthened in Prague by what we did in Berlin.(b) Further British Action.47. Mr. Newton takes the view that in the present situation it is better for us to go on doing something than to do nothing. If we try first one thing, then another, some solution may emerge. He is the more inclined to take this view since the events of last week-end. Whatever we intended, we are certainly regarded as being now much more deeply committed in the Czech affair than before. That being so, he thinks we might make the most of the position which this confers on us. It seemed to him that we could now hardly avoid having.to give more definite advice to the Czechoslovak Government than we have hitherto.done both as regards internal affairs and as regards Czechoslovakia^ foreign relations. As to the first we had so far used general terms only, and the second Ave had not mentioned at all. This impression Avas later confirmed (1) by the receipt of the Secretary of State&apos;s record of his conversation with the Czechoslovak Minister on the 25th May, in A\which he spoke for the first time of autonomy on the Swiss model, and raised the question of neutrality; (2) by the receipt by Mr. Newton of instructions to urge for the first time upon, the Czechoslovak Government the countermanding of some of their military measures.48. It is for the same reason that Mr. Newton would, on the whole, be in faATair of our despatching an observer or investigator or a commission of enquiry to Czechoslovakia. Activity, undertaken with the assent of all concerned, can hardly do much harm, and may do good.&apos;(c) The German Attitude.49. Mr. Newton thinks that the German press campaign against us Avas -due to the realisation that it was our attitude and action that prevented a German move last week-end, and arose from resentment thereat.50. According to a member of the Legation at Prague, the German Legation regard the events of last week-end as a master-stroke by .Dr. Benes. He has (1) placed Germany on the defensive before the world as the aggressor foiled; (2) he has sn&apos;engthened the position of the Government in the country at large, and particularly in the Sudeten areas; (3) he has brought His Majesty&apos;s Government to commit themselves.(d) Military Situation. .51. The view taken by Colonel Stronge, Military Attache at Prague, is as follows : 52. The Czechoslovak General Staff profess to have information about the German plan of campaign so far as it concerns Czechoslovakia. By this plan concentration would be effected gradually, under guise of moves for training purposes. The Czechoslovak General Staff interpreted the recent German troop movements in this sense, and exaggerated them for their own purposes. Czechoslovakia cannot afford to be taken by surprise. It was therefore essential in the national interest to make counter-preparations. Such reaction was inevitable, and Colonel Stronge is convinced that the General Staff will always react in this way every time such movements on the German side are perceived. Czechoslovakia^ chief danger is that of being immediately overAvhelmed by a surprise attack in force, and she can leave nothing to chance. A year hence she will be in an 80 per cent, better position to resist such an attack. This, in Colonel Stronge&apos;s view, disposes of any suspicion that the more responsible elements in the country Avhich include the General Staff would think that it Avould be better to have a war now than later.
53. Colonel Stronge is not himself convinced that the Germans intended any-military action against Czechoslovakia, though he admits that there was some kind of movement. At the same time, he feels that the Czechs had some justifi-cation for acting as they did for the reasons given above, and in the light of the Austrian precedent, though they exaggerated the extent of the German movements.54. Internally, the calling up of one class has done nothing but good. It has given the General Staff some useful experience. It has shown the country that the Government can govern. And it has made the life of the Czech officials in the German areas tolerable again.55. Recent travellers say that oh the German side there is not a man to be seen, while on the Czech side barricades have been erected, trees have been felled and there are soldiex-s in position.56. Colonel Stronge explained that the view he expressed as to German intentions was a personal one, which he did not think was fully shared by the Minister and other members of the Legation.57. Mr. Newton touched on this point during a talk I had with him on the evening of my arrival on the 26th May.58. His view was that the Germans probably did intend to move against Czechoslovakia last week-end, not necessarily by way of a full-dress attack, but more probably by way of incursions by S.A. and S.S., supported by a limited military concentration on the frontier.59. He thought that they had been deterred (1) by our warning in Berlin, particularly by the Secretary of State&apos;s personal message; (2) by the Czechoslovak military reaction. The measures taken by the Czechoslovak Government were, in Mr. Newton&apos;s opinion, justified. They were adequate to nip in the bud any serious local disturbance or to counter any limited incursion from across the frontier. They made it quite clear for the future that, if Germany wishes to act against Czechoslovakia, it must be by way of deliberate attack in force, and not by way of incursion. -His Majesty&apos;s Embassy, Berlin. May 29, 1938.Notes on Conversations with Members of His Majesty&apos;s Embassy at Berlin :.May 28-29, 1938.The Crisis of May 21-22.THE following outline of the position, which must, of course, be speculative, is drawn from conversations with His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, the Military Attache, and Mr. Kirkpa.trick, First Secretary at the Embassy.2. The necessary progressive psychological preparations had been made in the Nazi Press for action against Czechoslovakia, and by the end of last week the train was laid and the stage set. Had the train been fired on Saturday or Sunday, the public would have been ready for it. In the light of past experience it was a reasonable assumption from the terms used by the Press that some move against Czechoslovakia was imminent.3. Whether or not, in fact, any act was intended, it is impossible to say. A decision on these matters rests with one man alone. On this occasion Herr Hitler did not act.  What his intentions may have been cannot be known.4. There is little doubt that, had there been a &quot;blood-bath &quot; in Czecho-slovakia, he would have acted, and that the army would have wholeheartedly obeyed his order.5. There is equally little doubt that the army is not ready for a European Avar, and that advice to this effect is consistently given to Herr Hitler by the
leaders of the army. On the other hand, he is no doubt advised by Party hot-heads that, in spite of this, the&apos; risk is worth taking and that he would get away with his cowjjt once again. It is probable that had Herr Hitler thought he could have occupied the Sudeten&apos;areas without provoking a European war, he would have done so last week-end. - ; :6. The military preparation was not on a scale commensurate with the psychological preparation. The Military Attache and his assistant visited the areas where preparations against Czechoslovakia would naturally be visible, and saw. nothing to suggest that any move in force against Czechoslovakia was in contemplation. The Military&quot; Attache is not prepared to say that no such preparations were made. He would think it likely that certain precautionary steps were taken, but he does not believe that such moves as were in progress were in the nature of a concentration. There were undoubtedly moves taking place, but these might reasonably be held to be of a routine nature. It is not out of the question to suggest that the Czechoslovak Military Intelligence Depart-ment, which was naturally in a jumpy state, may have been deliberately led by the German military authorities to think that some move was on foot. This may have been designed as a demonstration or a warning, to encourage the Sudeten electors or to deter the Czechoslovak authorities from provoking incidents.7. In the event, the German military authorities gained valuable informa-tion from the crisis. They discovered what would be the character of the Czechoslovak counter-dispositions; and they learned what would be the probable attitude of the French, British and perhaps Polish Governments in case of war. They now know what to expect.8. The Military Attache does not think that in present circumstances the General Staff would consider that the mounting of a surprise attack upon Czecho-slovakia would offer sufficient advantages to outweigh the disadvantages of delivering what would necessarily be, in such circumstances, an inadequately prepared blow. They would not wish to undertake this operation without at least partial mobilisation. This could not be concealed, and the necessary preparations would take several days. The Czechoslovak Government would therefore have a few days&apos; notice, so far as serious military operations are concerned, though there might be heavy air attacks and minor military incursions delivered without warning. (I gather from the United States Ambassador at Berlin that this view is not shared by his Military Attache, who thinks that Germany can deliver a considerable attack without prior mobilisation.)9. This does not, of course, exclude the two possibilities (i) that Herr Hitler might order immediate military action at whatever risk in case of a serious incident in Czechoslovakia; (ii) that at some later date, the General Staff may judge that the will and power of the Czechoslovak army to resist has become so weak that the German army could secure its immediate territorial objectives in the Sudeten country with light forces, and without serious military operation, in conditions which would make French (and therefore British) intervention unlikely.10. It follows from what has been said above that in the view of the Embassy it would not be accurate to suggest (as has been done in some quarters) that there was a deliberate intention on the part of Germany to attack Czecho-slovakia in force; that the preparations for such an attack were set on foot; and that the intention was foiled and the preparations suspended in consequence of the reaction of foreign Governments, including, in particular, the warning given by His Majesty&apos;s Government on the 21st May. The truth would more probably be that some stern message to Czechoslovakia, amounting perhaps to an ulti-matum, was in contemplation after the shooting of the two Sudeten Germans at Eger on the morning of the 21st May; and that the German Government decided not to proceed with this plan when they saw that it would not improbably lead to a European war, for which they were not ready. Herr Hitler would naturally there-fore suffer from a sense of frustration in that Germany&apos;s liberty of action in Central Europe on a matter affecting a German population has, owing to the present[17316] c
incompleteness of Germany&apos;s military preparedness, been curtailed by action from abroad. This feeling would be the more bitter in that two Sudeten Germans lost their lives, and he did nothing about it. He would also suffer from a sense of exasperation in that the world as a whole has maliciously attributed to Germany certain grossly aggressive intentions which, it is said, have been foiled, but for which, in Germany&apos;s view, there would, on any honest contemplation of the facts, be no warrant whatever.11. It is His Majesty&apos;s Government, above all, who are the target for German resentment, since we are regarded as having played the chief part in frustrating Germany. It is all the more necessary, therefore, in Sir N. Henderson&apos;s view, that we should make a renewed effort at Prague in order to be able to show Berlin that our activity; has had some positive result.Further Action in the Sudeten Question.12. The Embassy think it inevitable, in view of the events of last week-end, that His Majesty&apos;s Government should take an even more prominent part than hitherto in promoting a settlement of the Sudeten problem.13. They agree with Mr. Newton in thinking that in present circumstances it is better to go on doing something than to do nothing.14. They would favour the despatch of an investigator or commission of enquiry to Czechoslovakia, provided that this is done under British and not under international auspices, and provided that operations would be confined to Czechoslovak territory, the object of the investigation or enquiry being two-fold, namely, a study of the problem and an enquiry into incidents should they arise.15. Unlike Mr. Newton, they do not believe that Dr. Benes-seriously intends to make a comprehensive settlement, but rather that he relies on France, Soviet Russia and Great Britain to save him from the consequences of his recalcitrancy. This view is shared by the French and United States Ambassadors at Berlin.16. They think that the German Government would like a peaceful settle-ment of the question. Sir N. Henderson is convinced that Heir von Ribbentrop was speaking Herr Hitler&apos;s mind when, on his return from Italy (where Czechoslovakia was obviously discussed), he said that the German Government &apos;&apos; heartily welcomed &apos;&apos; our action at Prague and wanted a peaceful solution.17. They agree with Mr. Newton in thinking that the settlement must be in two parts, i.e., (a) self-administration on something like the lines of the Carlsbad programme, within the frontiers of the Czechoslovak State; (b) some readjustment of Czechoslovakia^ foreign relations.18.   Like Mr. Newton, they think it premature to jH&apos;opose a plebiscite.19. They think that self-administration for the Sudeten areas would be a first step towards incorporation in the Reich. The limits of the area under self-administration would mark the future frontier. If it should so suit the Reich Government, incorporation would not necessarily take place. But in any event, while the period of self-administration lasted, &quot;there would be a gradual two-way movement of the population, Czechs, Jews and anti-Nazi Germans moving out of the self-administered German areas, and pro-Nazi Germans from Czech areas moving into them. This process would make incorporation an easier process, when the time was ripe. In any event, the Embassy think that the German Government would prefer this kind of process to a surgical operation by plebiscite. The Embassy think that His Majesty&apos;s Government, having taken a hand in this Sudeten question, must go through with it. They regard the present operation as the first serious attempt made since the war to tackle one of the causes (rather than merely one of the symptoms) of European unrest, and to promote peaceful change in one of the danger spots of Europe.20. They suggest that if the negotiations between the Czechoslovak Govern-ment and Herr Henlein break down, it might be desirable for us to approach the German Government, and to discuss direct with them the terms of an
illequitable settlement. Once His Majesty&apos;s Government and the German Govern -ment had made up their minds on such a plan, it would be for the German Government to make Herr Henlein accept it, and for His Majesty&apos;s Government to invoke the assistance of the French Government in imposing it upon the Czechoslovak Government. In that event, Czechoslovakia might receive a guarantee from both France and Germany, and the settlement might be &quot; witnessed &quot; (to use Dr. Benes&apos;s word) by Great Britain and Italy.21. If His Majesty&apos;s Government are to intervene to this extent, the case for despatching a Commission of Enquiry to Czechoslovakia to study the Sudeten problem and recommend a settlement becomes a strong one.W.
