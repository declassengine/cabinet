THIS JXXXMEm IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;3 GOYERMMEffl?.SECRET, COPY No,C,P.136(38)DIVORCE AND NULLITY OF MARRIAGE (STOTIiAND) BILL. Memorandum By the Secretary of State for Scotland.On the 15th December, 1937, my predecessor circulated to the Cabinet a Memorandum, (C.P, 311(37)), on the Divorce and Nullity of Marriage (Scotland) Bill which was introduced by Lord Alness in the House of Lords last year in a form slightly modified from that in -which it passed through, all its stages in that House during the previous Session.     The Memorandum asked for the authority of the Cabinet, in the event of the Bill being given a Second Reading in the House of Commons, to co-operate in the proceedings in Committee, and generally in securing that the Bill remained in a suitable form for inclusion in the Statute Book.     It proposed also that Government time should, if necessary^ be made available for the remaining stages of the Bill.In the course of the Cabinet discussion of the Memorandum the then Lord Chancellor expressed the hope that the Cabinet would not agree to give Government timo for the remaining stages of the Bill, (Cabinet 49(37)   Conclusion i).  Ho pointed out that this had not been -promised in the case of tho corresponding English Bill until the Private Members&apos; time had been fully exhausted and the chances of the Bill had been destroyed by reason of the fact that a Private Members&apos;s Friday v/as wasted owing to an all-night sitting on a Government motion. My predecessor, in view of the Lord Chancellor*s representations, undertook to leave to the future the issue of whether Government time should be made available for the Bill or not.The Bill has now passed through all its stages in the Lords, has received an unopposed Second Reading in the House of Commons and has been dealt with by the Scottish Grand Committee in the course of three sittings.     It incorporates tho best features of the English Matrimonial Causes Act, and certain features of/
of the Scottish Bill of last Session which seemed to present difficulty have been discarded.    In its present form I believe it is acceptable to all sections of moderate opinion in Sootland, and tho Church of  Scotland, at whose General Assembly it has just been considered, offer no opposition to it.In these circumstances I asa. satisfied that if the Bill were to fail to reach the Statute Book because ef lack of Parliamentary time, the Government would be exposed to criticism in Scotland,    Moreover, it must be borne in mind that fram 1573 until 1937 the Scottish law af Divorce was more flexible and liberal than the English,    Last year the English Law drew abreast, and even went ahead by introducing certain remedies unknown to Scots Lav;,    This is a situation which the Lord Advocate and I are agreed should be remedied without further delay,I should like, therefore, to repeat the request made &quot;by my predecessor for authority to facilitate the remaining stages of the Bill by the grant of a small amount of Government time if this should prove neoessary,    I do not anticipate that the proceedings on the remaining stages of the Bill would be protracted,J.C.Scottish Office,, 7th June, 1938,
