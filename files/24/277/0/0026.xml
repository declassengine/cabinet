Printed for the Committee of Imperial Defence.   June 1938.169-C. &quot; &apos;(Also O.D.C. 684-M.)COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE.SARAWAK AND BRUNEI.-DEFENCE OF MIRI AND SERIA OILFIELDS:   DENIAL SCHEME.Memorandum&apos;by the Oversea Defence Sub-Committee of the Committee ofImperial Defence.AT their 372nd Meeting on the 13th May, 1938, the Oversea Defence Committee had under consideration the question of the protection of the Miri and Seria oilfields on the northern coast of the island of Borneo. These two fields lie in the adjacent territories of Sarawak and Brunei and the products of both are refined in one plant at Lutong in Sarawak. The British Malayan Petroleum Company which operates the Seria oilfield in Brunei is controlled from the head-quarters of the Sarawak Oilfields, Ltd., at Miri, and in all but name the two companies are the same concern.2. The defence of these oilfields has been considered by the Committee on several occasions in the past, and in O.D.C. Memorandum No. 654^-M dated the 8th February, 1934, the Committee reviewed the whole position in detail and made certain recommendations for the consideration of the local Governments con-cerned. These recommendations dealt with the protection of the oilfields against sabotage, the formation of a local Volunteer Force to resist sea-borne raids by an enemy, and a scheme (known as the &quot;Denial Scheme&quot;) for denying the use of the oilfields to an enemy, by interference with the machinery, in the event of a determined attack which it would be beyond the capacity of any local forces to drive off. This memorandum was not laid before the Committee of Imperial Defence since it dealt with matters of purely local concern. In connection with the Denial Scheme, however, certain new considerations have been brought to light involving questions of principle which the Committee consider it necessary to refer to the Committee of Imperial Defence.Seizure of the Oilfields by the Japanese more likely than destruction.3. In the first place they are informed that the Oil Board, in making allocations of sources of supply during the first year of a Far Eastern war, do not now count on the availability of any oil from the island of Borneo. Japan, however, who is mainly dependent on overseas supplies of oil, normally draws a considerable portion of her supplies from the British and Dutch oilfields in this area. In these circumstances, it seems probable that the seizure of the Sarawak and Brunei oilfields might be one of the first objectives of the Japanese in a Far Eastern war, and would be a much more likely course of action than the mere destruction of the installation by a raiding force.[17331] b
Importance of the Denial Scheme.4. It must be recognised that before the arrival of the British Fleet at Singapore it would not be practicable to prevent such a seizure of the oilfields by the Japanese, since Sarawak and Brunei could not, at the best, maintain sufficient local forces to resist an attack in force. In view of the fact that the oilfields are likely to be of far greater comparative value to the Japanese than to ourselves, the Committee consider that, from the defence point of view, it is of the first importance to ensure that their use could be effectively denied to the enemy in war. In their opinion this should be the first objective of the local defence plan in a Far Eastern &quot;War, and should, if necessary, take precedence over any attempts at the direct defence of the oilfields which, as stated above, could hardly succeed in the face of an attack in force. If the personnel of the oil companies were drawn away for service in a local volunteer force at the outset, the success of the whole Denial Scheme might be prejudiced. Local forces might play an important part in the defence of the territories at a later stage, but the Committee deal with this aspect of the problem in a separate Memorandum, which it is unnecessary to refer to the Committee of Imperial Defence.5. The Denial Scheme has been worked out in great detail by the personnel of the oil companies.   Briefly, the scheme is :  (i) To remove certain small essential parts of the machinery which could not be replaced, except from Europe or by special manufacture, which would take several months.(ii) To insert hidden stoppages in the joints in the maze of pipes at the refinery and in the oil pipelines generally, which could only be dis-covered and rectified by almost completely dismantling the plant.Ciii) To render the oil products in store valueless by mixing, for example, benzine with fuel oil and vice versa.ItTis estimated that by this means the oilfields would be unusable by an enemy for anything from six months to a year. The scheme has the advantage that if the threatened attack failed to materialise, the whole plant could be very rapidly got to work again by the staff of the oil companies who had carried out the work in the first place. From recent reports which have been received from the High Commissioner at Singapore,* however, it appears that there are two serious weaknesses in the Denial Scheme as it stands at present.Disposal of parts removed from, the machinery.6. The first of these is a matter for the attention of the local authorities in Malaya, Sarawak and Brunei. The present arrangements are that when the parts have been removed from the machinery, they should be made up into small packages suitable for porters, and carried into the jungle and hidden by Dyaks collected under orders of the Sarawak Resident at Miri. If this were done, however, there would always be a danger that some of those concerned in their disposal would be induced, under duress, to disclose the whereabouts of the parts to the enemy. The Committee therefore consider it essential that the parts should be removed to Singapore, by sea or, in emergency, by air. They recommend that arrangements for this purpose should be worked out by the local authorities at Singapore and included in the Malaya and Sarawak Defence Schemes.7. There remains the possibility that, owing to the sudden arrival of the enemy, there would be no time to send the parts out of the country. To cover this contingency the Committee recommend that emergency arrangements should be included in the Denial Scheme for the complete destruction of the parts the moment it becomes certain that it will not be possible to remove them from the island.A uthority for initiating the Denial Scheme.8. The second weakness in the scheme is the present uncertainty as to the authority for issuing the orders to put the Denial Scheme into force, and it is to this aspect of the question that the Committee desire to draw the particular attention of the Committee of Imperial Defence.   When the whole question was* i.e. the Governor, Straits Settlements, who is also High Commissioner for the Malay States (including Brunei) and British Agent for the States of North Borneo and Sarawak.
last considered by the Oversea Defence Committee in 1934 they were not disposed to recommend the adoption of any hard-and-fast system of issuing the orders for putting the Denial Scheme into force. The responsibility was left with the local Governments of Sarawak and Brunei, and it was intended that the High Commis-sioner at Singapore (in his capacity as British Agent for Sarawak), under covering authority from home, and in consultation perhaps with the Naval Commander-in-Chief, would advise these Governments as to the moment when action should be taken. It has been represented to the Committee, however, that this uncertainty is unsatisfactory. The local Governments would naturally tend to defer the issue of orders for the Denial Scheme to be put into force to the last possible moment, having in mind the fact that they would, primarily at least, be responsible for any consequential loss or damage which the oil companies might incur.9. This question of compensation in the event of the Denial Scheme being put into force seemed likely to present a serious obstacle to speedy action in an emergency. The terms of the oil company&apos;s lease in Sarawak contain no clause such as exists in the case of Brunei, under which the local Government would take over the oilfield in case of emergency and pay compensation for any loss in such circumstances. Such a clause is normal in all colonial oil leases, but the Sarawak Government had negotiated their agreement with the oil company without taking any advice from the Colonial Office. This aspect of the question was discussed inter-Departmentally by representatives of the Treasury, Colonial Office, Admiralty and the Mines Department, and it was agreed that it would be prefer-able that His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom should deal directly with the oil companies, both in Sarawak and Brunei, on the question of the cost of putting the Denial Scheme into force and of any compensation for war damage. There seems no reason to expect that this will be unacceptable either to the Rajah of Sarawak or to the oil companies. Since, however, it involves acceptance of a contingent liability for compensation by the United Kingdom Government, it is clearly desirable that the Denial Scheme should be put into force only at the discretion of a competent authority and not at that of either the local manage-ment of the oil companies or of subordinate local officials. It is understood that this is a point to which the oil companies themselves attach considerable importance.Importance of the time factor in the Denial Scheme.10. The main question for consideration is the means of issuing the orders to the local management of the oilfield to put the Denial Scheme into force with the least possible delay. It is necessary at this point to emphasise the paramount importance of the time factor. It is estimated that 36 hours would be required to make any considerable progress in the execution of the Denial Scheme, and although a good deal more could be done in 48 hours, a period of 96 hours would be required to complete the whole scheme. It is, therefore, obvious that even a few hours&apos; delay may mean all the difference between success and failure. It is important to bear in mind also that if the Denial Scheme is put into force and the emergency never materialises, the resultant loss is comparatively small, being only that due to the stoppage of a few days&apos; work in the fields, with the additional loss due to the contamination of the oil stocks. On the other hand, if the starting of work under the Denial Scheme is delayed too long, the whole plant may fall undamaged into the hands of the enemy.Procedtire in the event of a period of strained relations.11. In these circumstances the Committee strongly recommend that the Denial Scheme should be automatically put into force on the adoption of the precautionary stage against Japan. The necessary action would then be taken immediately the &quot; Warning &quot; Telegram was received in Sarawak.12. There might also be circumstances in which it would be desirable to put the Denial Scheme into force before the formal adoption of the precautionary stage. In this case, special telegraphic instructions would have to be sent from home, since the United Kingdom Government would alone be in full possession of the facts necessary to reach a decision.   The Committee, therefore, recommend[17331] b 2
that, to cover this contingency, an appropriate entry should be made in the Government War Book, under the heading of &quot; Immediate and Vital Security Measures,&quot; similar to that relating to the defence of the Suez Canal.Procedure in the event of an unexpected act of hostility.13. A third possibility is that of an entirely unexpected act of hostility by the Japanese anywhere in the Far East, before the adoption of the precautionary stage, or even before special instructions had been sent as envisaged in the. preceding paragraph. Such an act might take the form of an unexpected attack on Hong Kong or on British shipping. In such circumstances, the Committee consider that it would be desirable for the highest local authority, who would be likely to receive immediate news of such events, to be made responsible for arranging for the Denial Scheme to be put into force immediately, without reference to the United Kingdom. Reference home might well involve a delay of several hours, which, as has already been explained, might be of vital importance. The Committee accordingly recommend that the responsibility for action in these circumstances should be vested in the High Commissioner at Singapore, who would naturally receive immediate notification of unexpected acts of hostility from all local sources of information, both service and civil. The Committee attach considerable importance to this provision, since it appears by no means unlikely that, should war with Japan ever break out, it might be started by &quot; a bolt from the blue.&quot;14. It is, of course, possible that the first act of hostility might be the arrival of enemy vessels off the oilfields themselves. The Committee have already dealt with this case in their previous Memorandum (O.D.C. Memorandum No. 654r-M), in which it was recommended that some form of emergency scheme should be worked out for use at short notice. The action that could be taken in the limited time available would haAre to be left to the judgment of those on the spot.Channel of Communication.15. Assuming that the above proposals are approved, the channel of communication for the issue of orders to put the Denial Scheme into force would be as follows : (a) Colonial Office despatches the &quot; Warning &quot; Telegram (announcing theadoption of the Precautionary Stage against Japan) or a special telegram [vide paragraph 12 above) to the Rajah of Sarawak at Kuching.(b) Alternatively, in the circumstances envisaged in paragraph 13 above, theHigh Commissioner at Singapore on his own responsibility, but with the authority vested in him by His Majesty&apos;s Government for such an emergency, issues telegraphic request to the Sarawak Government at Kuching.(c) The Resident at Miri receives instructions from the Sarawak Govern-ment at Kuching and gives the executive order to the local manager of the Sarawak Oilfields, Limited.16. Kuching and Miri are some 350 miles apart, and it is possible that the wireless, which forms the only speedy means of communication between these two points, might be interrupted. The Committee therefore recommend that simul-taneous cabled instructions should in all cases emanate from the High Commissioner at Singapore through the British Resident in Brunei. The latter would pass them on immediately to the oil company, and also inform the Sarawak Resident at Miri.Summary.17.   To sum up : (i) It seems most probable that in the early stages of a Far Eastern war the Japanese would try to seize the Sarawak and Brunei oilfields for their own use rather than destroy them. We, ourselves, do not rely on supplies from this source in such a war (paragraph 3).
(ii) The personnel available locally, even if organised in a volunteer defence force, would be insufficient to defend the oilfields against an attack in force. It is therefore considered essential to ensure that the use of the oilfields can be denied to the enemy in an emergency, and a Denial Scheme has been worked out for this purpose (paragraphs 4 and 5).(iii) The Committee recommend that essential parts of the machineryremoved in accordance with the Denial Scheme should be taken out of the country to Singapore by sea or air, or in the last resort destroyed, and that they should not be merely hidden. The Defence Schemes of Malaya and Sarawak should make provision for this accordingly (paragraphs 6 and 7).(iv) The time factor is all-important to the success of the Denial Scheme,since 96 hours are required for its completion (paragraph 10). (v) The Committee recommend that, to guard against breakdown of local wireless communications in Sarawak, instructions for putting the Denial Scheme into force sent to the Sarawak Government should be repeated by the High Commissioner at Singapore direct to the British Resident in Brunei, to be passed on by him to the Sarawak Resident at Miri and to the management of the oil company (paragraph 16). (vi) The Committee seek the approval of the Committee of Imperial Defence to the following recommendations relating to the initiation of the Denial Scheme: (a) That the Denial Scheme should be automatically put into force on the receipt in . Sarawak of the &quot;Warning&quot; Telegram announcing the adoption of ,the precautionary stage against Japan (paragraph 11).(6) That an entry should be made in the Government War Book to ensure that, in the event of strained relations with Japan but before the adoption of the precautionary stage, the desirability of ordering the Denial Scheme to be put into force is considered as an &quot; immediate and vital security measure &quot; against Japan (paragraph 12).(c) That the High Commissioner at Singapore should be given standing authority to order the Denial Scheme to be put into force at his own discretion immediately on the occurrence of an unexpected act of hostility by Japan in the Far East, if such orders have not already been issued under (a) or (b) above-paragraph 13).(Signed) V.

DENIAL SCHEME.(C.I.D. Paper No. 469-C.)THE COMMITTEE had under consideration a Memorandum by the Oversea Defence Committee on the defence of the Miri and Seria Oilfields (C.I.D. Paper No. 469-C).SIR COSMO PARKINSON said that we did not depend on supplies from the Oilfields of Sarawak and Brunei in a Far Eastern war, and a scheme had therefore been worked out to deny these fields to an enemy by removing vital parts of the machinery and inserting hidden stoppages in the pipelines. It would, of course, be realised that compensation might have to be given to the oil companies if the Denial Scheme were put into force, on whatever basis might ultimately be decided for war damage generally; but it had been agreed in inter-Departmental discussion that any arrangements in this connection should be made direct with the oil companies by the United Kingdom Government, on whom the liability must ultimately fall, and not through the local Governments concerned. The time factor was very important in the Denial Scheme, since 96 hours were required for its completion. The difficulty was to ensure that the Denial Scheme was put into force m time to make it effective. The proposals of the Oversea Defence Committee to ensure this were summarised in paragraph 17, sub-paragraph (vi), of the Memorandum. They were that the scheme should be automatically put into force on the receipt Of the warning telegram announcing the adoption of the precautionary stage against Japan. There might, however, be circumstances in which the United Kingdom Government knew that relations with Japan were very strained and might consider it desirable to have the Denial Scheme put info force before the precautionary stage was adopted. To cover this contingency an entry would have to be made in the Government War Book. The third possibility was that of a local and quite unexpected act of hostility by Japan, which would be the prelude to a general outbreak of hostilities. To cover this contingency the Oversea Defence Committee recommended that the High Commissioner at Singapore should be given a standing authority to order the scheme to be put into force on his own responsibility, without reference to the home Government.SIR THOMAS INSKIP said that the question of compensation was a very important one. Under the Denial Scheme we were undertaking a liability whose magnitude we could not foresee in advance.SIR WARREN FISHER thought that we could not avoid this contingent liability. If the fields were, in fact, put out of action, the United Kingdom Government would have to pay compensation.SIR COSMO PARKINSON pointed out that if the scheme were put into force and the attack did not materialise after all, the compensation to be paid would be comparatively small, since the oil installations would not be destroyed and could be quickly got into working order again by the personnel which had carried out the Denial Scheme in the first instance.[17444-1]
SIR THOMAS INSKIP suggested that, in view of the financial liability for the United Kingdom inherent in the scheme, the proposals should receive the approval of the Cabinet.Conclusions. The Committee of Imperial Defence agreed: (a) To recommend the approval of the proposals of the Oversea DefenceCommittee relating to the Denial Scheme for the Miri and Seria oilfields, as contained in OLD. Paper No. 469-C.(b) That, in view of the fact that these involved the acceptance of a contingent liability for compensation by the United Kingdom Govern-ment, the covering approval of the Cabinet should be obtained.,   .      *    . * * * * *2 Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1, June 23, 1938.
