Q91*J bj JLBOARD OF TRADE ADVISORY COUNCIL0 STATE OF TRADE - LAY,  1933.Summary of reports submitted- by Members of the Board of Trade Advisory Coucil (supplemented in some cases with statistical information from other sources).OVERSEAS TRADEo  Imports in May at  75.4 million were  7.8 million less than in May, 1937;    imports of food, drink and tobacco were  0.9 million more, and raw materials and articles mainly unmanufactured were  5.2 million less. Exports of United Kingdom products,  38.2   million, were  4.6 million less than a year ago.EMPLOYMENT. Employment showed a slight decline between 4th April and 16th May.      It is provisionally estimated that at 16th May, 1938, the number of insured persons aged 16 to 64 in employment in Great Britain, exclusive of persons within the Agricultural Scheme, was approximately 11,375,000.      This was 15,000 less than at 4th April, and on a comparable basis about 148,000 less than at 24th May,  1937.RAILV/AY TRAPFIC.    In the 4 weeks ended 29th May railway traffic receipts decreased by  1.3m.  (10.43%)  compared with the corresponding period of 1937.     Comparisons are affected by the incidence of the Whitsun holidays.     As from 1st October last charges were increased by 5 per cent, except suburban passenger   fares within the London Passenger Transport Area.SHIPPING.      The freight markets continued disappointing, with a further contraction in the volume of business.    The Chamber of Shipping index number of freights, at 130.6 (1935 a 100) for May, was slightly higher than in April but nearly 30 per cent lower than a year ago.      There has been some additional laying up of ships in United Kingdom ports since the returns for April.-1-
SHIPBUILDING,,      The position as regards new orders continued serious, though there was some improvement during May,BANKING,,      There was a large withdrawal of foreign-owned funds from London in May owing to the depreciation and stabilisation of the French franc.     Provincial clearings declined Toy 10 per cent compared with a year ago, hut the reduction may he partly due to the lower level of commodity prices now prevailing. FINANCIAL CONDITIONS ABROAD3Belgium.      Owing to the depreciation of the French franc, and the Belgium&apos; Cabinet crisis, the currency was subjected to heavy bear attacks and the National Bank lost considerable gold and foreign exchange.      By the end of the month pressure had subsided and the spot rate recovered from 29.70 to 29.30.France.      The depreciation of the franc took place at the beginning of the month and there was a reflux of capital to France followed by a reduction on the 12th May of the Bank of France discount rate from 3% to 24%.     The Bourse was active after the depreciation but later business slackened.again.Hungary.      The 1938-39 budget now before Parliament is the first balanced budget since 1931.      The Government have embarked on a five-year plan of re-armament and public works to be financed out of domestic resources.     Hungarian exports for the current year showed an appreciable decline as compared with a year before.U..S.Ao      There was no improvement in business during May and some industries showed a further decline.    The effects of the Administrations spending policy are not expected to show till the Autumn.    The Stock Exchange was weak, many companies having passed or reduced dividends.    The dollar, which fluctuated in sympathy with European political events, fell to 5000 on French repatriations, rose later to 4.93 at the time of Czecho-Slovakian problems, and closed at 4.94% -4.95-g on 31st May. p
9 0 9 tS 6 wCOAL.    The usual seasonal decline in domestic consumption was accompanied by a decline in industrial demand, notably in the metallurgical industries.      The export market suffered from a contraction in international trade and from restriction of imports by France and Belgium.     Exports were valued at  3.5 million as compared with  2.98 million a year before.IRON AND STEEL.      Conditions in the industry were quiet, the flow of new orders for steel having slackened.and pig iron business remaining dull.      Large stocks of pig iron and semis continued to accumulate.      Output of pig iron (634.000 tons) was 8.9 per cent, less than in Hay, 1937:     there were 105 furnaces in blast at the end of May as compared with 122 a year earlier.      Crude steel production (957,000 tons) was 8.6 per cent, less than in May, 1937.     Exports of iron and steel (168,000 tons) were 61,000 tons less than a year ago:      imports (56,000 tons) were 42,000 tons less.ENGINEERING.    There was no change in the general situation in May.      Although prospects for new business were slightly improved, the volume of new orders showed further reduction. The decline was most evident in general engineering and electrical engineering.     Activity in marine and constructional branches was maintained.     Exports of machinery in May were valued at  4.7 million as compared with  3.8 million in May, 1937. Imports ( 1.8 million) were  264,000 less.NON-FERROUS METALS.-   Metal prices fell during May to new low levels since 1935.      Russian and Japanese buying was quieter. The demand from United Kingdom consumers was better than in the early months of 1938, but the tonnages bought were generally small.ELECTRICAL INDUSTRY.     Production in May remained at a slightly higher level than a year before, but the rate of incoming orders was rather less.      Exports of electrical goods and apparatus for the first five months amounted to  5.7 million, compared with  4.8 million for the corresponding period of 1937.
Electricity generated in May was 14.4 more than in May, 1937.COTTON?     There was no sign of an improvement in business during May.      Production remained at a very low level and employment continued to decline.      The volume of new orders for yarn was still considerably less than the current production and stocks remained high.     Exports of piece goods were 110 million square yards as compared with 162 million square yards in May, 1937.WOOh. There was a further recession of activity during May, particularly in the worsted spinning section. Exports of tops, yarns and tissues declined as compared with the previous month.TIMBER.     The market trend in soft-woods showed little change during the month and operations were mainly limited to immediate requirements.      Reports from provincial centres indicated that consumption remained active and stocks were being reduced.      The proportion of the season&apos;s export sold by the chief European producing countries was the smallest for many years.     Arrivals of American hard-woods during May were substantially less than a year ago.POTTERY.     Employment in April was substantially less than a year ago.      Home  demand for general earthenware and china was slackj but export markets in May improved slightly.      In the tile section there was a marked decline in orders, and the sanitary earthenware trade showed no improvement.RETAIL TRADE.      The money value of total retail sales in April was 11.4% higher than in April 1937.      Sales of food and. perishables increased in value by 15.3%;    sales of non-food merchandise rose by 6.9%.      Preliminary returns for May show substantial declines in total sales in most areas, owing partly to the incidence of the Whitsun holidays and partly to the heavy increases registered last year on account of Coronation business.CANADIAN TRADE. Business operations improved during April and the index of the physical volume of business rose for the second consecutive month. Common stock and wholesale prices, however, continued to reflect depressing conditions.

AUSTRALIAN TRADE,    Bales of wool received into store during the ten months ended 30th April were 2,803,000 compared with 2,725,000 a year &quot;before, the quantities sold or shipped &quot;being 2,330,000 and 2,635,000 respectively. Wheat and flour shipments between 1st December and 25th May were equivalent &quot;to 82.0 a. bushels compared with 59.5 rn. bushels in the previous year.      Butter exports from the 1st July to the 21st May were 83,000 tons compared with 74,000 tons a year before.      Imports of merchandise during April amounted to L0o5m.  (Australian currency) compared with  10.2m. last year.SOUTH AFRICAN TRADE.      The effect of the break in commodity and security prices overseas is now appearing in the check to business expansion, although the gold-mining industry continues active.     Total imports for April were 5.6% less than the year before.      Exports other than gold were 45.9% less.     There were increased exports of coal, bunker coal and ships&apos;  stores, but substantial declines in diamonds, wool, hides and skins, wattle bark and extract, and copper.
