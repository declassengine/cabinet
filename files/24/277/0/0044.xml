-Printed-for the Cabinet.   July 1938.SECRET. Copy No.CP. 163 (38).CABINET.GERMAN ATTITUDE TOWARDS EVENTS IN SPAIN and portugal.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.IN accordance with the conclusions of the Cabinet at its meeting on the 6th July, I circulate herewith the text of a translation of a lecture given by General von Reichenau, Commander of the 4th Army Group at Leipzig, to National Socialist leaders at Leipzig, on the subject of the German attitude towards events in Spain and Portugal.H.July 7, 1938.LECTURE BY GENERAL von REICHENAU.(Translation.)THE conflict in Spain vitally affects the German people. That is the consideration which moved us in giving our moral and material assistance to Nationalist Spain. After General Franco&apos;s military successes that have borne his arms to the shores of the Mediterranean, the problem has been brought to a point where one last, decisive effort is required.This situation confronts us with the question whether we must content ourselves with maintaining our help to Nationalist Spain at its present level, or meet the new circumstances by increasing that help. Some hold that there is no justification for going on with our participation in the Spanish war, since it prevents us from concentrating all our forces on the accomplishment of the most important national tasks. In opposition to this view, we are emphatically of opinion that our intervention in Spain was not only correct, but must now be increased. We propose to give the grounds for this belief. For the sake of completeness we shall, without going into fuller details, state certain considera-tions that, to him who thinks in military terms, should appear obvious, but which, precisely because they are obvious, do not always receive the full importance that is their due.In the first place, one thing must be laid down :. Germany has not become weaker through her intervention in Spain, but, on the contrary, stronger, and her prospects have been bettered. The successes we have thus obtained lie in different fields; they are military, technical, strategical, or belonging to the domain of foreign affairs in general. The military successes are of special importance, for they hold so many lessons of a decisive character that we may well speak of the Spanish war as of a Staff College.What has always reckoned and always will reckon in the relations between the nations is their relative military strength. It follows that the fundamental 9947   [17514]  
problems are the military ones. Mussolini once said something of the sort, and that is the viewpoint from which Spanish affairs should be envisaged. It would not be accurate to hold that the Spanish war is a second-class war that is not to be taken as 100 per cent, serious from the military point of view. The stiff fighting the Nationalist troops have had to encounter for every square inch of territory alone demonstrates that the Spanish struggle is a military test of strength of modern kind from which, since we are engaged upon it, we may learn valuable lessons.  What, then, have we learned and wherein do our advantages lie ?In the first place, we have tested in Spain the worth of our aviation. On the basis of our experience in Spain we have been able to build up an entirely new air arm, with such success that our air force, which until 1936 constituted the Achilles&apos; heel of our national defence, at one leap placed us in the forefront of all the nations. Our designers have&quot; proved themselves capable of devising technical improvements embodying all the teachings of aerial fighting in Spain in the shortest space of time, and our industry was able to modify its production along the lines of the new models. To-day, our superiority in the air is acknow-ledged even by foreign air experts who, like the French air general Armengaud, but one short year ago held that the Russian planes were better than ours.But improved planes require pilots of improved quality. There can be no doubt that this is a problem the solution of which is not easy. If one considers objectively the world&apos;s air armaments, one will find that the greatest difficulties each State has had to encounter, and which each tries to solve in its own way, lie in flying instruction. This past year has shown particularly clearly that inventive genius, technical improvements and mass production have progressed at a much quicker pace than the methods of teaching people how to handle these new models. The Spanish experiences we have had have given us a chance superior to that of others of neutralising this difference of pace between technical progress and instruction. For nothing could be better suited to give a huge impetus to the training of our aviators than the practical fighting experience they had in Spain.Since plane designers produced the dive-bomber we have become the world&apos;s pioneers in handling this kind of type. Without going here into details concerning our practical and technical methods of attack, we may say that our fliers are able to dive at their objective with a speed of 600 kilom. per hour and to attain a fair degree of accuracy in aiming from the smallest conceivable altitudes. We know that 600 kilom. planes diving down from high altitudes to very low ones are hard to hit, and we also know what that means to the infantry. Besides which our JTJ 87 has proved itself very well protected from hostile fire, easy to repair and to keep up, and so disposed that it gives the crew a relatively high degree of security. jOur pilots who have been trained in Spain are the best and the most skilful. Our possession of such fliers gives us an enormous advantage over our foe of to-morrow, who will have had much less experience. We can afford to say that, for we have always acknowledged with perfect fairness the excellence of aviators of other nations, particularly the French. But they lack experience of the real thing. The Spanish war experience of our picked dive-bombers is a great asset of our re-born army. Since we have had all these advantages from our practice in Spain, we cannot wonder at the fact that our fliers and our machines have won victory after victory in the military air contests in 1937 and 1$38.Regarding defence against air attacks, we may say that, even before the Spanish war, ours was so developed that it could be held up as model for all other States. In Spain it was organised after our methods, but war experience has taught us much that was new in this department also. We had a defence against air attacks that was based on meeting planes flying at 200 kilom. per hour, but it is obvious that when the planes fly at 600 kilom. an hour, other methods of protection are required. These include a homogeneous plan, centralised organisation and special observation methods. In an age when the entire territory of a country constitutes the&quot; zone of war, it is evident that an efficient defence against aircraft can only be set. up through the close co-operation of all arms and all authorities. Volunteer initiative and goodwill on the part of the citizens must yield pride of place to exact military regulations that,.in the last resort, must lead up to the central military command. We are aware of the fact that the necessary conclusions have been drawn and applied, and that to-day, as before, we occupy in this respect the. first place.
The experience of the Spanish war has made it easier for us to abandon the wrong path we were treading as regards tanks. The war in Abyssinia, where the Abyssinians lacked all means of countering tanks, had established the reputation of the light tank. This led us to launch ourselves upon the wholesale construction of these light and fast machines. We neglected the building of heavy armoured tanks. On the Spanish battlefields it turned out that it was precisely the heavy tanks with their steel armourplates that proved far away the more efficient. Our light tanks were unable to&apos; meet even machine-gun fire; and they proved incapable of overcoming difficult ground obstacles. We had to pay a heavy price for our mistake, but it led us to build that type of heavy tank that is rendering excellent service in Spain to-day.From the very beginning we achieved much better results with our anti-tank weapon. It is known that all the great Powers are just now devoting great attention to this weapon. The results we have obtained in Spain entitle us to claim that, taking into account that the anti-tank problem is still in its infancy, the German 3 - 7-cm. anti-tank gun is still the best in the wprld, even better than the corresponding gun in use in the United States of America.The infantry has ever been one of the chief elements in Germany&apos;s military power. The experiences garnered in Spain as regards the use of infantry agreeably confirm our ideas on the subject. Infantry has remained the prince of battles and the machine gun handled by infantry is the queen of all arms. One need only to point to the fact that it was only thanks to machine-gun nests that the rush of the Nationalist troops on Madrid could be stopped. We have had occasion to note the excellence of bur conceptions of infantry training by observing the achievements of Italian and Spanish Nationalist infantry in Spain. We have further been able to get valuable ideas on the subject of the co-operation of infantry with the other arms.Spain has taught us particularly valuable lessons in the use of motor vehicles in war. We discovered problems we had never properly envisaged before and which we are now beginning to master. For instance, it is of supreme importance to gauge aright the proper conditions under which motor vehicles may be efficiently used in fighting. We now know a lot more than we did about such things as the urgency of arriving at the right solution of the problem of the technical worker, the timely organisation of fuel, the creation of adequate reserves of spare parts at strategically important points and their distribution to the troops, whether on the march or in the fighting line. We have reached the conclusion that spare parts, oil and fuel may in modern war be more important even than ammunition. As the result of the observations thus made -we are able to tackle in earnest the solution of the problem of the modern army&apos;s fateful dependence upon oil and spare parts.The Spanish experiment has further taught us the necessity for paying greater attention to the technical training of drivers and given us the broad lines upon which this training ought to be based. We realised in Spain that the best of roads get damaged, shot or bombarded to bits, and that there is a tendency in action for traffic to move along secondary roads on fairly low grounds, roads that very easily get out of order. A motorised unit is particularly sensitive to the destruction of bridges and other such public works. Even the improvised Red troops were able at times to achieve wonderful results, so that we must be prepared to have a properly trained enemy cause us the greatest trouble along these lines. We have learned a lesson from the critical situation that ensues when destructive operations are carried out on low-lying ground and that the necessary material for repairs must be brought along from a long distance. This has enabled us to work out the conditions that permit of bringing down to the lowest possible figure the percentage of accidents among motor vehicles driving with war load in rainy or misty weather, or along half-destroyed roads. We may feel assured that, as a result of these lessons, we will make out of the motor vehicle that efficient instrument of war that modern warfare obviously intends it to be.We have also learned valuable lessons as regards the conduct of operations. We have studied attentively the great possibilities of success vouchsafed by the &quot; mass use of planes, tanks and artillery. We have further, leaving aside the debated question whether war of position is or is not avoidable, recognised the importance of the tactic of bold strokes; not only may the best practical results be obtained from such a tactic, but one may build up on that foundation a whole strategical system. Our experience on the narrower ground of Spanish battle-fields has amply corroborated what, politically as well as strategically, the Italian [17514] ^ B 2
Mediterranean tactics had shown, namely, that boldness is the best form of strategy. By sheer boldness, Italy was able to -demonstrate how easy it was to intimidate England and France. Some might consider it a doubtful experiment to transfer this political experience to the field of war operations, but the basis in both cases is the same; it is a psychological basis. Boldness is the best condition for surprise.&apos; Both sides in Spain have succeeded in carrying out many a bold stroke. Good leadership with well-trained troops at its disposal would be able to turn such strokes to advantage and alter the entire character of operations, thus creating the necessary conditions for a war of movement. And let us not forget that war of movement is that form of warfare that suits best our national tradition and spirit. ;Spain has shown us new ways in intelligence work. Frontiers are a happy hunting ground for the collecting and transmitting of information. It is easier to smuggle Spaniards in and out of one part of Spain than it would be to smuggle Germans into an enemy country. We have worked systematically and have collected valuable hints regarding the best methods for learning to foresee the enemy&apos;s intentions, extending possibilities of observation and perfecting the means of transmission of information acquired.Summing up all that we have gained in a military way by our intervention in Spain, we may say this. Two years of real war experience have been of more use to our as yet immature &quot; Wehrmacht,&quot; to the efficiency of our new* army and hence to the defensive power of the German people as a whole, than ten years of peace-time training could have been. A military preparation that is based mainly on theory cannot reach the necessary degree Of perfection. We got the opportunity to grasp this in March of this year when we had to hasten to the assistance of our Austrian brothers. There were many difficulties, and many defects in organisations and technique became evident. Yet despite all this our troops were able to achieve something that filled our hearts with pride. That this was so is due in no small degree to the fact that we had been able to apply part at least of our Spanish experience. Thus our participation in the Spanish war rendered our policy a great service on the 11th March.If policy be considered as a part of strategy one must take one of its main tasks to be the preparation in time of peace of the highest possible degree of readiness for war and the acquisition of the most favourable strategical positions in view of war. This being so, it is evident that the Spanish war has not only been a splendid school of war, but also a piece of excellent policy. During the preparation for the war of 1914-18 the principle just enunciated &apos; had been neglected to far too great an extent. For systematic and careful war preparation it is necessary to devise means whereby long beforehand one may get at the enemy, his commercial routes, his sea routes, his means of transport, his fixed and movable potentiel de guerre everywhere where serious war operations may be expected; A State like ours, not being in a position to acquire the necessary points d&apos;appui by direct action, must fill up the gap thanks to its alliances. This we have done by means of our Italian agreement embodied in the Berlin-Rome axis, and by means of our intervention on General Franco&apos;s behalf. From the point of view of military strategy, we have got at the most important vital lines both of England and of France. Therein lies the paramount importance of our intervention in Spain.The French general Bilotte has said that one may expect the first events of the next war to occur in North Africa, and has further declared that the Mediterranean basin with its Asiatic and African hinterland forms a homogeneous strategical region. In the light of. these declarations we see that, thanks to our situation in Spain, we hold a favourable position at one of the crucial points-of this strategical region. -One must take this into account; that the main vital line both of England and of France, that, namely, which leads through the Mediterranean, has become highly problematical. For the international significance of the Mediterranean does not merely depend upon the fact that that sea links together Western Asia, Northern Africa and those South European States that lie along its shores. It mainly depends upon the fact that, since the opening of the. Suez Canal, it has become the shortest sea route between the Atlantic on the one hand, the Indian and Pacific oceans upon the other. True, England, still holds strategically important points at the entrances to the Mediterranean and along its course-thus the line Gibraltar-Malta-Port Said, then the port of Alexandria, Cyprus and the fortress of Aden that bars egress from the Red Sea to the Indian Ocean.&apos;
But Italy alone already surpasses England in the number of her naval and aerial bases in the Mediterranean.. One may count upon Italy being able, in case of war, to stop or at least very seriously to impede English sea-borne traffic between Gibraltar and Port Said. Italy occupies a commanding position in the centre of the Mediterranean basin. Her Libyan colony lies in North Africa, Her&apos; fortified bases are to be found not only along the coasts of the European continent, but on the islands that border that coast (Sardinia, Sicilyr Pantelleria) and further in the ^aegean Sea (Leros and Rhodes) and in Libya (Tripolis and Tobruk). She has further established similar bases on the coast of Eritrea at Massaua and Assabe and is fortifying the islet of Dumeiria in the Red Sea. The Gibraltar-Port Said section of the British Empire&apos;s main line of communication is void of such bases and therefore comparatively weak; it is precisely that section that passes through the region where the Italian system of fortified bases is most developed; partly it has these bases in its flanks. True, the Italian fleet is smaller than the British; but the latter is distributed over three oceans, whereas the former is wholly concentrated in the Mediterranean and may be considered to be a very ready and efficient instrument, particularly as regards its submarines. It may be expected that in war-time, the British fleet would operate &quot;in conjunction with the French fleet in the Mediterranean, but fleets no longer have the decisive importance they used to have. The decisive factor nowadays is the air force, and in this respect Italy enjoys undoubted pre-eminence in the Mediterranean basin.One may conclude, generally speaking, that no big troop transport and no systematic trade in raw materials would be possible in the Mediterranean unless the hostile air force had previously been greatly reduced. England has definitely lost her monopoly of the Mediterranean. That sea has become a No Man&apos;s Land in which no fleet may operate in security and for the possession of which a stiff fight is being waged.Spain and the Berlin-Rome axis have given us the chance to participate in that historic struggle. We are pushing events in the desired direction in which we have already made some progress. Among instances of such progress may be reckoned our support of General Franco in putting up long-range batteries in the vicinity of Algeciras and on the African coast opposite Gibraltar near Ceuta; these ought to render good services when it comes to cutting the Anglo-French vital line. There are other instances. For instance, the taking over to our account of the pan-Arabic and pan-Islamic movements. The watchword &quot; Allah il Allah &quot; that is stirring the whole Islamic world of the Asiatic-African Orient from the Straits of Gibraltar to the heart of British India bodes ill for England and France; for us it is of use. For here we have a dynamic force that sends out its rays to British India with its 80 million Moslems and to France&apos;s African empire with its vast resources in raw materials and its recruiting field for coloured soldiers. This same force threatened England&apos;s shortest route to India, the one that goes over the Arabia and Iraq bridge. One of our leading experts, Admiral Gadom, has aptly described the significance of England&apos;s &apos;&apos; closed protection wall around the Persian Gulf.&quot; In a work that is to be published shortly, he under-lines the fact that the threat to this zone of influence through the barring of the - Mediterranean route and the general rising of the Arabs, would &quot; cause the central arch of the British world empire to collapse.&quot; The same thing is true of France. Even before the Anschluss of Austria, France had a population 24 million smaller than that of Germany; she depends upon her African empire for reserves of men in case of a campaign on the Rhine. To stop this avenue of reinforcements would be tantamount to severing France&apos;s vital nerve.These are all reasons that make it important for us to use the Spanish bridge as a way of keeping contact with the pan-Arabia movement. One of our best strokes was to give General Franco the advice to publish his well-known declaration granting the Moroccan tribes the right to autonomy.True, Mussolini has also endeavoured to take over the role of Protector of Islam, but we must not forget that his &quot;Italia Muselmana,&quot; his newly-founded African empire, contains some 5 million Moslems; when the storm of pan-Islamism breaks, it may very probably also affect the Italian colonies. We are apparently in a more favoured position. Some of our earlier efforts (for instance, that with Abd-el-Krim) turned out failures; but this was due less to unskilfulness on the part of the German negotiators than to the timidity of the Moors, whose liberation movement at that time was in its infancy. To-day that movement has ripened historically, and in the present situation Germany is the only country in a position to help the Arabs effectively without limiting their national aspira-
tions. Delbrueck once described a similar situation approximately as follows : &quot;Here is an objective relation, born of nature and of history, that cannot but turn out to Germany&apos;s advantage.&quot;France&apos;s ties with the Mediterranean basin have assumed fateful importance. Her communications with Africa can be endangered in the first place by Sardinia and from the Balearic Islands that are in enemy hands. France may be forced in case of war to fall back upon the Atlantic route for her troop transport from Africa. That route, which takes about 100 hours, is from four to five times longer than the Algiers-Marseilles route (21 to 22. hours). That delay may mean a lot to us in time of war. If a quick German offensive at the outset of the war could coincide with a considerable delay in the appearance of France&apos;s important reserves, the resulting advantage to us and disadvantage to France is evident.France&apos;s possessions in Africa supply her with important raw materials (for instance, manganese from Algeria) and reserves of men. But France has other possessions in the Near and Far East and in the Pacific Ocean. These colonies, as in the case of those of England, are the chief sources of oil and similar invaluable assets; the shortest route to them runs through the Mediterranean. That route may be considered as unuseable in case of war, so that France would lose vital transport routes in two directions : north-south and west-east. The same thing is true of England.This unpleasant situation for France can only, however, be fully exploited if we can make use of the air bases that are meantime being organised in northern Spain to attack the south-west region of France that has hitherto been ungettatable for us. That, too, is an important result of our activity in Spain, j We have thrown the foundations of a fighting front, partly German, partly Italian, partly Spanish Nationalist, along the Pyrenees against France.Moreover, we have a psychological advantage in one respect. M. Herriot, the president of the French Chamber, addressing the national congress of the French Radical party at Lille on the 29th October, 1937, reminded England that in future she would only be able to use the Mediterranean with the permission of Hitler and Mussolini. He could have added that the riparian peoples of the Mediterranean basin are looking on while the prestige of England and France crumbles away with every new success of General Franco. Since everyone knows that these successes are due in very large part to German arms, it follows that our prestige as well as our actual military strength have ,risen considerably as a result of our policy in Spain. The logical conclusion is that we must not only continue this policy, but advise that it should be pursued with greater intensity and vigour. There are certain considerations we propose to deal with presently, certain other aims, that render this course particularly advisable-England has not been slow in recognising the danger that threatens her vital line Gibraltar-Port Said, and she is taking counter-measures. In this connexion her attention is directed to Portugal.This State, with 7 million inhabitants, 900-kilom.-long frontier towards Spain (most of which is open) and its 800-kilom.-long Atlantic coastline, cannot possibly remain untouched by the present struggle in the Iberian peninsula. It is also exceedingly important both for France and for England, and this importance could only grow in case of an interruption of the Mediterranean route. &apos;When Vasco da Gama in 1498 discovered the cape to which he gave the name Of Good Hope, he little dreamed that one Ferdinand de Lesseps would come some day and by digging the Suez Canal render that sea route Gama had discovered useless, or at least superfluous. Now the pages of history have turned once more; the surest route to India now leads precisely where 450 years ago it was discovered by Vasco da Gama. To use. this substitute route over the Cape of Good Hope, England and France add 40 per cent, to the length of the voyage, and their troop-ships must sail along Portuguese coasts. Portugal must therefore remain within the British sphere of influence; otherwise the Franco-British position would suffer a further dangerous shock.During the world war England paid so little attention to PortugaFs sovereign rights that she made use of the good harbours of Madeira as naval stations long before she had succeeded, in spite of the opposition of the army and the Con-servatives, in inducing the Portuguese Government to declare war on Germany. Portugal&apos;s unique situation on the Atlantic fringe, which endows that country with every possible strategical advantage, is bound to make England keener than ever on keeping her feelers in Portugal.   The most important of sea and latterly
also air routes lead along Portuguese coasts and can be either defended or attacked from it. Portugahs bridge-like position towards Africa is obvious. So is its close connexion with the Mediterranean basin. Madeira is ideal as an observation post on the entrance to the Mediterranean. The Azores, protruding as they do westwards, are bound to play a big part in international aerial inter-course over the Atlantic. The right to make use of them would free England from many a care regarding supplies of food and raw materials in war time. Together with the Gape Verde islands, the Azores are strung out along the first half of the seaway to South Africa; the southern half of that route leads past Portuguese Guinea, Sao Thome, Principe and the long coast of Angola. The mere thought that these positions might some day fall into the hands of an enemy is irreconcil-able with the existence of the British Empire. This clearly shows why, in view of the altered conditions in the Mediterranean, Britain needs Portugal&apos;s friendship more than ever, y&apos;This is, indeed, the key to England&apos;s &quot; traditional &quot; friendship to Portugal and, to speak in more concrete terms, to the task entrusted to the British Military Mission that recently visited Portugal. It may be surmised that the brilliant State reception given to Admiral Sir Eoger Backhouse, commanding the British fleet anchored in Lisbon roads, had more to do with talks about naval and air bases than with amiable toasts. At any rate, these Anglo-Portuguese pourparlers fit perfectly into the framework of the systematic reorganisation of England&apos;s military might: a might that depends in no small degree upon the changed Mediterranean situation.The fact that England may be driven to using the Cape route and that that sea-way may best be protected from Portuguese territory is not the only compelling reason for Anglo-Portuguese friendship. Portugal is necessary for Britain&apos;s strategical plan which foresees the blockade of the Mediterranean at a distance by means of the Gibraltar and Port Said barriers. The Suez Canal barrier is supported by the British points d&apos;appui in Palestine, in Egypt and in the Sudan, and it is well known that England is working there with might and main. But Gibraltar cannot be held without Portugal. In such a blockade the air force will play a leading role. Britain lacks the necessary landing-places and wide anchorages in the Mediterranean. Aircraft carriers, owing to their limited capacity and their own vulnerability, are at best but a poor substitute. The harbours of Malta and Gibraltar are too narrow to be quite satisfactory in this respect. But the situation would be entirely changed if England had an air base on the southern coast of Portugal at her disposal. From Silves, Faro or Tavira, British planes could render splendid service in defending obsolescent Gibraltar and could even escort transports into the Mediterranean.For us to see that these preparations are being made is tantamount with taking counter-measures in time. Here, too, our tactics must be the same. In view of the blockade of the Mediterranean and the French Atlantic and British Cape routes, we must get at the sensitive points of this system with a view to disturbing and finally destroying it.The condition for a successful counter-stroke on our part is that we win over Portugal to our side. Portugal must cease being, consciously or unconsciously, a pawn on the Anglo-French chessboard, where a game is being played that runs counter to our own interests and also to those of Nationalist Spain. What methods can be applied ? Are there any signs of existing factors that might be developed in a direction favourable to us ? Are there in Portugal itself any movements or tendencies which we may use for the accomplishment of our aims ?One thing is certain from the first: that under the rule of Sr. Salazar Portugal has become an authoritarian State, an orderly State, one which may be held up as example to Europe. Its prestige abroad has grown, and so has its national consciousness, and this leads to a feeling of revolt against the influx of foreigners in its economic life, and against the lasting tutelage of England. England treats Portugal as if it were a colony; yet she pretends to defend Portugal against the alleged designs of Germany on Portuguese colonies. But despite this, German sympathies in Portugal have grown to a very large extent. Among the Nationalist elements they were bound to do so,. for the entire spirit and state of mind of the Portuguese people is such that sympathies flow more readily towards young, ascending nations than towards old and decrepit colonial Powers.Portugal&apos;s attitude towards Francoist Spain is to our advantage and to the disadvantage of England.   National circles in Portugal follow the struggle in
Spain with intense interest. The two Iberian nationsJiave drawn very close to one another, so that the conditions appear to-day to be more favourable to a federation than they have ever been before. That means that the British alliance would lose all value for Portugal and that our friendly relations with Portugal would,have to be intensified. In this connexion it is interesting to note that among the founders of the Spanish Nationalist movement there were certain pan-Iberian forces at work. One of their chief representatives was General Sanjurjo, who had, shortly before the outbreak of the rising, been conducting negotiations in Berlin. The death of the general was a heavy blow to us, for it has rendered it easier for Portuguese circles that have drawn nearer to England to disavow engagements taken at that time. . But we still have a number of connecting points. In any case, it seems that Germany&apos;s best chance for a successful counter-stroke against England in Portugal lies in support of the pan-Iberian movement and in seeking the friendship of such groups as are dreaming of an opening-up of the colonies and a restoration of the old political and economic importance of the Iberian peninsula. In short, those who, in the pursuit of these aims, are bound to come up against Portugal&apos;s vassal-like position towards England,In this direction it seems to us that we possess enough to go upon. There are many practical possibilities for driving authoritarian Portugal in opposition to British tutelage and for thus preparing the way for disturbing the British plans for the Cape route and for the blockade of the Mediterranean at a distance. We can succeed in winning over Senhor Salazar, whose sense of every kind of national movement is very keen. We can secure points d&apos;appui in the Portuguese army, where sympathies for the pan-Iberian and anti-English ideas are particularly strong; the activities of these cells must sooner or later turn to our advantage. But we can also reach our goal over the roundabout way of General Franco&apos;s victory. If necessary, the powerful army that General Franco will have at his disposal after winning the victory in Spain can be thrown into the scale; supported by the widespread feeling in favour of Nationalist Spain in Portugal, that army would be able, a trifle more efficiently than by diplomatic means, to install in Portugal a regime acceptable to us.We need hardly reckon with resistance, but should resistance be offered, the Portuguese army is rather weak. Portugal has only, at most, 140,000 trained soldiers and the navy is not of much account. One thing is certain : the Spanish Nationalist movement is so dynamic that it cannot halt at the Portuguese frontier.In the long run these movements, tendencies and actions, the consequences of which we have foreshadowed, indicate that Portugal can and must come under our influence and become a base for us. That is one reason further why we are in Spain, and it is the logical consequence of the course of events not only in Spain but in the entire Mediterranean region.We now come to the general conclusions to be drawn. In the first place, we must observe that the issues of the future national strength of Spain, of Gibraltar, the Balearic Isles and the relations of Spain to the Western Powers lie and must lie in General Franco&apos;s hands.We may add an optimistic impression : that the historical situation is at the moment favourable to us and to the Berlin-Rome axis.The right course for Germany is to strive to become stronger and stronger, for might is the best ally. This course we have begun to tread with great success. Through the Spanish war, our activities on Spanish soil and in the basin of the Mediterranean, we have succeeded in loosening the apparently granite-built edifice of the Versailles system in Europe : more, we have laden it with dynamite-Thus we have succeeded in definitely overcoming the results of the World War.The centre of balance has shifted from London and Paris, eastwards to Berlin. In Western European political circles this truth is recognised. Witness the expression used in a mood of resignation by the Temps, which sums up this feeling : &quot; The heart of Europe no longer beats in Paris.   It beats in Berlin.&quot;But the most important basis of operations for attaining all these successes has been Spain, where it logically-follows that we must increase and intensify our support of the Nationalist cause. Our participation in the Spanish war has in no wise disturbed the concentration of our forces for the achievement of important national aims.  On the contrary, it has helped it in the most definite manner.
