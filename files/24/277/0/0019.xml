i a jSECRET.I.-INTRODUCTION.Progress of Provincial Autonomy.1. Thirteen months of provincial autonomy should enable some estimate to be formed of the results said prospects of the new Constitution. It would, how-ever, be premature to attempt anything more than a tentative appreciation. For one thing, there arc only-two provincial Ministries-those in the Punjab and JBengal-which have held office for the full term. In the other two non-Congress Provinces,-Assam and Sind, the original Ministries were forced to resign-in Assam to effect a purge and reconstruction under the same leadership, in Sihd to give place to an entirely new Ministry. In the other seven Provinces the Congress Ministries entered on office&apos; only in July. &apos;      ;&quot;If examples were needed of the successful inauguration of the provincial executives, one could be adduced from each class. The Punjab Government may fairly be said to have fulfilled expectations : communal strife has been the most serious threat to the peace and progress of the Province, but&apos;the creation of the problem cannot be laid at the door of a Ministry which has done all it can to solve it.In the Congress class the Madras Government has performed with confi-dence and success a task which is certainly easier since communalism in that Province causes no great inconvenience to the Ministry and other acute problems have not arisen to disturb the prosecution of its plans. At the other extreme it would not be difficult to name Provinces where the Ministerial administration lias shown one or more of the defects of amateurishness untempered by modesty, internal dissension, and a hesitant approach to the first essential of government  the preservation of public order.In general it may be said that Ministerial government has proved to depend largely on the men who have come forward to work it. Outstanding personal-ities have been thrown up, such as Sir Sikandar Hayat Khan in the Punjab and Rajagopalaehari hi Madras : there are others, such as B. G. Kher the Bombay Premier, Pandit G. B. Pant the V. P. Premier, and Dr. Khan Sahib the N.-W. F. P. Premier, who command respect and liking, though they have shown lack of some of the (dements of leadership and statesmanship : some other Ministers have exhibited genuine competence in departmental work. But on the whole the level of personality and efficiency among the Ministries is disappointing : and it must be admitted as a general statement that the machine has suffered in the hands to which it has been entrusted. This result was in some measure expected and inevitable ; but there is not at present sufficient ground to forecast either a rapid advance in the efficiency of the teams now in charge of the machine or a change-over to more competent handling.2. The administration of the greater part of British India is in the hands of Congress Ministries. Further, those Ministries are bound to implicit obedience to an organisation the professed aim of which is to overthrow the present Constitution and compel the construction of another which would give Congress almost unfettered control. So stated, the position provokes wonder, not that matters have not progressed as well as might have been hoped, but that they have not already come to disaster. Three crises have blown up : first, the Con-gress refusal to take office in the Provinces where they won the elections ; next the sudden conflict in. February which brought out the Ministries of the U. P. and Bihar over the release of &quot; political &quot; prisoners ; and now the opposition to the appointment of an Orissa official as officiating Governor of that Province. The first two crises passed over ; the third promises to pass without a cataclysm. From these events it is possible to draw conclusions warranting both hope and misgiving. &quot;Were these demonstrations mere symptoms of nervousness and suspicion, the outcome should have helped to remove those feelings, since they have been met by patient effort to win trust and co-operation. If, however, they are in effect trials of strength, deliberately undertaken in furtherance of the aim stated above, misgiving would be well justified.3. Thus a forecast would depend on the answers to the questions What are the real aims of Congress ? Are they still the overthrow of the Constitution and the attainment of Independence f One difficulty in answering these ques-tions lies in the fact that the dominant personality of Congress, and of India, stands outside the administration and (nominally) even outside the machineryLS38HJD
that controls the Congress Ministries. That Gandhi has been a stabilising influence since the introduction of provincial autonomy few would deny : that he has the power to inflict on the greater part of India once again the throes of civil disobedience is probably still true : as to his will to take this step if he can-not get his way, it would not be safe to prophesy.4. It is without doubt a danger to the Constitution that the control of Con-gress Ministries lies in the hands of men who are not responsible to the provincial electorates such men (besides Gandhi) as Jawaharlal Nehru, Subhas Bose and Vallabhai Pat el. There is also a danger in the weakness and poor yepute of some of the Congress Ministries, since there may be a temptation to smash the machine in order to fasten blame on the makers instead of on the men who have mis-handled it. But every day that brings some advance in the working-out of the provincial programmes commits the Ministries more deeply to seeing them through : and where, as in most of the Congress Provinces, the lines have been laid down and a fair start made along them, there will be growing unwillingness to abandon the task for a shibboleth. The crisis of February found Ministries, other than the two concerned, loth to resign. The controversy of April was brought to a crisis without the Congress Premiers even being consulted. On each occasion the order to resign would almost certainly have been obeyed, but reluct-predominantly and with some resentment : and the time may come when the Premiers will claim more say in decisions which may interrupt tasks on which they have set their hearts.5. &quot; Arrogance &quot; has been imputed to Congress with good reason. Its claim to speak for India was not unnatural after the intoxicating successes of the general election. But a force has arisen since which has disturbed the confidence of Congress and subdued its pretensions. Lamentable as is the exacer-hation of communal feeling between Hindus and Muslims, the growth of the Muslim League has served to remind Congress that it can speak only for a portion of the Indian people and that there is a power still to be appeased before any final plans can be prepared for an Indian Constitution in place of that which now holds the field.II.-CONGRESS PROVINCES.(a) Ministries ; stability and reputation.6. Bihar. -The crisis1 in February, described in paragraphs 84 88, which resulted in this Ministry&apos;s resignation, naturally hadfa disturbing effect for the time, but when the Ministries returned to work they soon settled down again, and the crisis appears not to have affected their relations with the Governor ancl the permanent staff. There is pressing need for an extra Minister, but the Premier cannot make up. his mind to ask for one. The Ministry has had no difficulty in maintaining its position in the Assembly : but it is said to be not too happy, either in its internal relations or in its position in the Province. The threat of kisan (peasant) trouble is ever present : and a fresh controversy has arisen over the employment of Bengalis as officials of the Provincial Government.7. Bombay. The Ministry maintains its position without difficulty. Desai, the Revenue Minister, is still&apos;a troublesome element. Munshi (Home Minister), though he continues to show firmness of touch in dealing with Vlisorder, brought on the Ministry some disrepute from his interference in a criminal case. The private life of Nurie, Minister for Public Works, is believed to be not above suspicion and has caused his colleagues some anxiety. Vallabhai Patel con-tinues to retain strict control over this Ministry. The personal repute of the Premier (Kher) continues high : hut his hold over some of his colleagues is uncertain, and it is believed that Munshi in particular would be willing to supplant him.8. Central Provinces. This Ministry is less a corporate body than a congeries of-jarring elements. Internal dissension lias greatly weakened the Premier&apos;s control of it, and its reputation has suffered as the result of the behaviour of individual members. The quality of some of the Ministers is low : the Congress Working Committee are believed to have a poor opinion of the Ministry : and an enquiry is now proceeding at the Committee&apos;s instance which may result in its disruption. The main ground for the enquiry is the action of Sharif, Minister for Law, in ordering the premature release of a Muslim, Zafar Husain, who had been sentenced for the rape of a young Hindu
girl. The criminal case had attracted a good deal of notice as Zafar Husain, the principal accused, was an Inspector of Schools and a title-holder. Tho conviction may be assumed to have been on unimpeachable evidence since it was confirmed by the High Court on appeal. Sharif took this action without con-suiting his colleagues. There was an outburst of indignation, for which there was reason in the facts themselves, apart from their appeal to communal passion. Sharif offered to resign. This however would not have suited the Ministry since a Muslim to take his place would have been hard to find. (Sharif himself was elected on the Muslim League ticket and changed his coat to obtain office.) The local Congress party was induced to regard the incident as closed, on Sharif &apos;s tendering an apology. (This was interpreted as an apology for his misconduct, but he later represented it as being merely an apology for taking the decision without consulting his colleagues.) The Working Committee were not content, and at the beginning of April referred the matter to an ea;-Judge of the Calcutta High Court (who is also Law Member designate&apos; of the Government of India). His finding is expected shortly. It has been assumed that it will be within his terms of reference to consider the evidence for the conviction : and the pro-priety of an e:c-Judge of one High Court sitting in judgment on the decision of another High Court has not passed without question. Dr. Khare, the Premier, showed his wonted volatility : his first inclination was to throw over his colleague who, as he openly proclaimed, was a colleague chosen for him by the Congress high command : later, being none too sure of his own stability, he defended &quot;him. At first he attempted to obstruct the enquiry by refusing to produce the records, but in the end supplied even such as should have remained in the Secretariat. He regards the Working Committee as having been unduly swayed by Vallabhai Patel, whose antagonism to Khare is no secret.Khare&apos;s tenure of office has been rendered insecure by other incidents also : though he secured re-election as president of the Provincial Congress party, a committee of forty-two has been appointed tofwatch his Ministry&apos;s actions.dole, the Revenue Minister, also has been in hot, water for suspected dis-honesty over a manganese contract : and Misra (Local Self-Government) is suspectedover the premature release of a friend of his who was convicted for an insurance fraud. The Ministry&apos;s appointments of Public Prosecutors have been criticised as influenced by nepotism.Altogether the C. P. Ministry ranks low in repute among the Provinces. . 9. Madras. Under Rajagopalachari&apos;s leadership, and assured of an over-whelming majority in the Assembly and a comfortable one in the Council, the Madras Ministry has preserved its reputation as the soundest and most stable of the Congress Ministries. Labour troubles may give it some discomfort : the dispute in Harvey&apos;s mills (described elsewhere) has been temporarily sur-&apos; mounted by somewhat questionable tactics : there is possibility of trouble in other mills, and among the labour employed by the Madras Tramways and Electric Supply Company. Giri, the Labour Minister, has balance, but his experience as a labour leader may not be the best equipment for his task.The Agriculturists&apos; Belief Act, with its drastic abolition of old debts, has naturally alienated supporters many of whom combine the functions of land-lord and money-lender. There is, however, still no opposition capable of an effective challenge to the Ministry. Relations between landlords and tenants are in this Province not so pressing a problem as in some other Provinces, as legislation in recent years has met the more urgent needs.10. North-West Frontier Province. The Ministry&apos;s attack on the Khans (see paragraph 21) is likely to increase the feeling that this Muslim Congress Premier is adopting an anti-Muslim policy a fact adversely commented upon in a Muslim League resolution passed in April at Calcutta. Muslim League opposition to the Ministry is said to be strengthening ; and the Agriculturists&apos; Relief Bill is unpopular. The Premier&apos;s attitude to the Congress Working Com-mittee does not make for harmonv in Congress circles (see paragraph 32). Tho cleavages in the opposition parties however are a stumbling block in the path of any organised opposition to the Ministry.11. Orissa. The Congress party in Orissa has not been happy : the Pro-vinee was for a time divided into two camps, and though the troubles wern patched up when Gandhi visited the Province for the meetings of the &quot; Gandhi Seva Sangh &quot; in March, there was still the promise of disunion, and consequent embarrassment for the Ministry, when a controversy arose which has occupied the attention of the Congress party, in and beyond Orissa. At the beginning of March the announcement was made that Mr. Dain, the senior official of the Province, was to officiate when the Governor went on leave two months later. TJie Ministry protested at once, taking the ground that he -was their subordinate
and should not be elevated to a position above them.&apos; The fact that he would be retiring at the end of his officiating term was not regarded by the Ministers as excusing the appointment. On Ap.ril 1st, the Premier sent the Governor a written protest ; on April 4th, the Congress Working Committee considered the matter at their Calcutta meeting and passed a resolution strongly disapproving of the appointment and demanding- that it should be reconsidered. Though the Ministry&apos;s opposition to the appointment may have been in part actoated by the belief that Mr. Dain was not in favour, of agrarian legislation which they were promoting, the Working Committee took its stand on a principle which, as a general proposition, met with a good deal of support, even outside the Congress press. It was not long before it became known that the Ministry would resign unless the appointment were cancelled. Towards the end of April Gandhi (who had been responsible for the Working Committee&apos;s resolution) informed the Governor-General that the appointment raised a constitutional issue of the greatest importance and that it might well precipitate an all-India crisis. This private message was followed by a public statement in uncompromising terms : and the threat of sympathetic resignations of all Congress Ministries was echoed in a statement published by Subhas Bose, the Congress President. There is no reason to suppose that the Congress Premiers had been consulted before the threat was emitted. On the other hand, a command from Gandhi to resign would probably be obeyed with whatever reluctance by the more stable Ministries. A possible expedient (though open to obvious objections) in Orissa itself, if that Ministry alone resigned, might have been a &quot; minority &quot; Ministry led by one of the big landowners : but resignations in all the Congress Provinces would be a clear case of &quot; failure of the constitutional machinery &quot; over the greater part of British India.Though no strong exception could be taken to a rule of practice that an official should not be appointed as Governor in a Province where he had worked as a subordinate of the Government after the introduction of provincial autonomy ( a rule in fact illustrated by the other officiating appointments made this year), it was by no means certain that even acceptance of this principle for the future would prevent the crisis if Mr. Dain&apos;s appointment were not cancelled.At the end of April it was still uncertain whether a minor crisis limited to Orissa, or a major crisis extending to all Congress Provinces, or a solution of the difficulty was in store.12. United Provinces. The Education Minister (Pyare Lai Sharma) resigned early in March. He had never been prominent or comfortable in the Ministry. His place has been taken by Sampurnanand, of whose powers and influence it is too early to judge.The Ministry appears the stronger for the crisis of February, which brought them the credit of standing fast for the release of &quot; political &quot; prisoners and at the same time weakened pressure from the left. Circumstances (described elsewhere) have tended to overcome Pandit PanCs aversion from using the ordinary processes of law against disorder when that disorder is inspired by communal passion. It remains to be seen whether threats to public order of other kinds agrarian and labour agitation are only dormant will complete the process.Pant &apos;s Ministry is stable ; and its approach to the difficult problem of agrarian legislation seems, as far as it has gone, to have shown some apprecia-tion of conciliatory tactics.Pant himself shows signs of strain and over-work. Congress Ministries have an exaggerated prejudice against, resort to hill-stations in the hot weather, and the attempt to work in the great heat of Lucknowat the end of April has been too much for a man unaccustomed to the plains at this season.(b) Ministries&apos; Programmes.13. The programmes are now coming to fruition, by legislation and other-wise, and the greater part of them falls under specific headings of the survey below. No purpose would be served by covering the same gTound here : and for the most part this section will be confined to the budgets for the period April 1st, 1938 to March 31st, 1939 presented during the quarter, and the cognate subject of fresh taxation. If; has, hoAvever, proA^ed difficult to obtain the broad outlines of the Provincial budgets, and the following remarks cannot claim to be complete and may be read as subject to correction.In general it may be said that the budgets are not unduly ambitious : some reArenue has been sacrificed to implement election pledges, such as those piwid-ing relief to agriculturists and the introduction of &quot; prohibition &quot; : and steps have
sheen taken to explore the field of new taxation and to retrench expenditure by such devices as reduction of salaries for new entrants and reduction of allow-iinces.Two Provinces are again ton-owing money in the open market.14. Bihar. Revenue, which is about five crores of rupees in this Province, is expected to exceed expenditure by some three lakhs a surplus larger than that estimated in other Provinces. The most important item of new expendi-ture is the devotion of eight lakhs to rural development.A retrenchment committee has been appointed to consider &quot; the reorganisa-lion of ihe services and the fixing if possible of pay and allowances &quot;.15. Bombay. A budget deficit of nearly 41 lakhs is estimated. The revised (estimates for 1937-38 showed that an estimated deficit of 181 lakhs, was turned into a -Surplus of 101 lakhs, thanks to the Central (Government&apos;&amp; contribution under the Niemeyer award ; but 30 lakhs will be lost in the current year owing to the introduction of &quot; prohibi-tioiL &quot; : twelve lakhs will be spent on education. There are no other important changes ; the electricity duly and stamp fees and tobacco license fees will be slightly increased but no new taxation is announced The Finance Minister expects little saving from the reduced seale of salaries for new entrants to the services, which in any case have not yet been decided The total revenue of the Province is about twelve crores.16. Central Provinces. The Finance Minister has estimated a surplus of Us. 80,000 7 the revenue is about 4St crores. &quot; Prohibition &quot; is to cause a loss of six lakhs ; and seven lakhs, mostly non-recurring expenditure, is set aside for rural development and agricultural relief. A Retrenchment Committee is expected to effect some savings, and new revenue Is to be raised by taxes on professions and on motor-spirit.17. Madras. This Presidency has the largest revenue of all the Provinces, amounting to nearly sixteen crores. The Premier, Rajagopalachaii, who is hi charge of finance, has estimated a nominal surplus of Rs. 12,000. &quot; Prohibi-Hon &quot; is to be extended to two more districts and will cause a loss of twenty-six lakhs In all ; remission of land revenue to the extent of seventy-five lakhs and provision for loans to agriculturists of some fifty lakhs are two important items. The tax on the sale of cloth is expected to bring in one lakh. In order to pay for remunerative capital works the Government intend to raise another loan of 175 lakhs during the current year.18. North-West Frontier Province. The Finance Minister has budgetted for a deficit of 6i lakhs ; the revenue of this Province is the smallest in India, amounting to about 180 lakhs altogether, ISTo spectacular measures are proposed, but one lakh remission of land revenue and the introduction of prohibition &quot; are responsible for decrease in income. The Entertainments Duty Act which came into force on April 1st is expected to yield about three quarters of a lakh.19. Orissa. The budget estimates a deficit of two and a half lakhs ; the province has a total revenue of less than two crores. &quot; Prohibition &quot; of opium will cause a loss of a lakh of revenue, and some eight lakhs are to be spent on development schemes Including a scheme to combat the  flood  menace.20. United Provinces. Pandit Pant, the Premier, is in charge of finance. He has budgctted for a deficit of fifteen lakhs, which is worse than the last deficit by three lakhs. &quot; Prohibition7&apos; Is to cause a loss of fifteen lakhs, and no less than twenty-seven lakhs have been set aside for the controversial rural -development scheme which at the end of April seemed to be making little head-way. Government also intend to raise a new loan of 100 lakhs in the current year for capital expenditure on constructive work in rural areas.The Premier has occasionally mentioned his intention of reducing the salaries of new entrants to the services, but has not made definite proposals.21. A few other matters may be mentioned which will not receive detailed treatment clseAvhere in the survey.Bihar. Besides the committee above mentioned, this Government have appointed others to consider such diverse topics as educational reform, corruption In the services, labour problems, and the separation of judicial and executive functions. The Education Minister has in mind a scheme for the establislnnent of military schools.Bombay. A measure of some importance is a Bill to amend the Bombay City Municipality Act wliich contains a provision for adult franchise. The effect of this sweeping provision is however to be postponed to 1942.JLS38HI)
Central Provinces. The weeding&apos; out of honorary magistrates hag! greatly increased the work of the stipendiary magistrates-a result for which no provision had been made. Nepotism and partisan influences in filling the places of the dismissed Public Prosecutors, are openly alleged.The Ministry,, using powers taken in an Act passed early in the year, have set up an enquiry into- what is known as the Bilaispur election. At this elec-lion Mr. Raghavendra. Rao (once Home Member of the C. P. Government and Chief Minister in the &quot; interim &quot; Ministry) scored a substantial victory-over his Congress opponent. An election petition wits filed, but not proceeded with. Nevertheless the Congress Ministry, professing to suspect corrupt prac-tices and undue official influence, but more actuated by bitter hostility to. Mr Raghavendra Rao, have appointed a Committee to enquire into the atlega-tions. Thousands of witnesses have been cited, and the cost is likely to be several lakhs of rupees. The conduct of a number of officials is involved&apos;, and the Ministry have reluctantly agreed to the appointment of counsel to watch their interests. It remains to be seen whether this expensive enter-prise will be carried through.North-West Frontier Province. The Ministry have been making an attack on the position of the Khans, a class of big landowners, Muslims for the most part, who wield a certain amount of influence which the Government can-not Avell afford to alienate. They propose to abolish the posts of Zaildars, village officials of some standing recruited from landowners. They also proposed to throw open to election the hereditary office of lambardar. a lessei-village officer responsible for collecting- land revenue ; this proposal also would have hit the Khan class hard, but the Ministry have been persuaded to drop it.United Provinces. The Ministry has been busy with various details of jails reform.(c) Legislatures : events of the sessions.Agrarian legislation is dealt with fully In part (/) of Chapter V and will not be mentioned here. Other legislation and resolutions of importance are detailed below.22. Bihar. The budget session of the Assembly began on March 5th and had not concluded at the end of April. The budget was passed without difficulty. The Prohibition Bill was passed. The Assembly passed in&apos; April a resolution recommending &quot; the maintenance of a trained volunteer corps as a reserve force ready for mobilisation in a time of emergency &quot;. This is the first case of such a subject being raised in a provincial Assembly. The Council began a session on March 21st which was not concluded at the end of April.23. Bombay. The Assembly session which was in progress at the end of January finished on February 5th after the passing of the Temple Entry Bill (see para. 118) and the Tobacco Act Amending Bill. The former was reserved for the Governor General&apos;s consideration, and his orders had not been received at the end of April. The budget session began on February 25th and had not concluded by the end of April. The budget was passed in full. A Bill to repeal the Emergency Powers Act was passed after little discussion. (See para. 77.) A large number of legislative measures were considered, including a Bill (passed at the end of April) to amend the City Police Act in order to give the Commis-sioner of Police power to extern undesirables from the city. A Bill to create more village panehayats, and the Trade Disputes. Bill (see para.&apos; 96) were both introduced late in the session. A Bill to provide for the release on probation of first offenders was passed by the Assembly and the Council late in April. The Ministry are considering a Bill to make lotteries illegal. Three Bombay Bills, having been reserved for the Governor General&apos;sl consideration, have obtained his assent -the Small Holders&apos; Relief Bill, the Indian Limitation Amendment Bill and the Bombay Finance Amendmeiit Bill.24, Central Provinces. A short budget session lasted from March 2nd to the 21st. The budget was passed Avithout a cut and the Prohibition Bill became law. The Bills providing for taxation of motor spirit and professions Avere also passed. A Prisons Amending Bill Avas introduced, providing for specially lenient treatment of so-called &quot; political &quot; prisoners.. The Assembly passed the usual resolutions condemning Federation and the aAvard of titles, and a third suggesting the provincialization of the Imperial SerAdces, i.e., the I. C.S., the 1. P. and the I. M. S. The session Avas marked,by a.rising tide of discontent against the Ministry, and the -outcome (if the Ministry survives its present troubles) may be the creation of an organised opposition.
25. Madtas. The Agriculturists&apos; Relief Bill was passed by the Council on February 1st, was reserved for the consideration of the Governor-General, and received his assent in March. The budget session of the Assembly lasted from March 1st to the 30th. The budget was passed without a cut. A private Bill to grant greater rights to &quot;untouchables&quot; was introduced. A Traffic Control Bill was passed and reserved for the consideration of the Governor-General, who accorded his assent.&apos; A Motor Vehicle Taxation Amendment Bill was also passed. The opposition, though weak in numbers, was vocal, and often in conflict with the Speaker whose exercise of his functions was more voluble thru discreet. The controversial chanting of &quot; Bande Mataram &quot; was abandoned.   The Council sat during the whole of March.26. North-West Frontier Province. The budget session began on March 1st and had not concluded at the end of April. The Bill which repeals certain &quot; repressive &quot; enactments in the criminal law was passed : it is discussed in para. 80. The Prohibition Bill was passed and reserved for the consideration of the Governor-General, whose orders had not been passed at the end of April. A resolution condemning Federation avas carried. The budget was passed in full. The Ministerial party has gained strength ; it now numbers 22 pure Congress followers and four certain allies, as well as six other fairly reliable votes, in a house of fifty. The Opposition has split into groups even smaller than before, there being no less than six parties, of which only one follows a line of sustained opposition.27. OW.ssa.-The Assembly budget session began on February 25th and lasted till April 2nd when it was adjourned until May 2nd. The budget went through without a cut and the session showed the strength of the Ministerial party. No legislation of importance was undertaken except the agrarian measures. A resolution condemning Federation was passed ; this was the only occasion on which the Opposition were united.28. United Provinces. The Assembly session which was proceeding at the end of January closed on February 7th, after the Sugar Factories Control Bill had been passed as amended by the Council. The budget session began on February 28th and had not concluded at the end of April. The budget was much criticised but was passed without a cut. A Bill to enhance court fees, valid for three years only, was passed at the end of April, as well as a Bill fixing the pay of members of the.legislature at Rs. 75 a month with a daily allowance of Rs. 3 and double &quot; inter &quot;-class railway fare allowance. The Bill Avas severely criticised by the Opposition. The Opposition have shown some signs of activity. A resolution was passed alloaving the Speaker of the House to participate in politics outside the House ; and another recommending the provincialization of the Imperial Services. The only Bill from this Province which has required the Governor GeneraPs assent was the 1937 Moratorium Bill.   The Council sat from March 2nd to the 8th.(d) Relations of Ministries with the Central Congress Command.29. The predominance of the Congress Working Committee, acting either direct or through its Parliamentary Sub-Committee, over the actions of Pro-vincial Ministries is still supreme. It must, however, be added, first, that its supremacy is derived mainly from its speaking with the A^oiee of Gandhi the obedience is to him rather than to the Committee : and, secondly, that obedience does not exclude some restiveness. A number of instances of central control have come to notice in the quarter.30. In the U. P.-Bihar crisis of February, though there avas some confusion in the actual methods adopted, the policy of the two Ministries Avas dictated by the Working Committee. Had the crisis not been terminated, the other Congress Ministries would have been called out : there can be little doubt that they Avould have obeyed, though Avith reluctance on the part of most  especially as the release of &quot; political &quot; prisoners Avas not to most a matter of practical concern.&apos;31. The C. P. Ministry is not one of which Congress has reason to be proud : and the circumstances avhich required the interference of the Working Committee in the Sharif affair (see para. 8) avere discreditable both to that Minister and to the Ministry as a avhole. But the attitude of the Committee is understood to have been a shock to the Ministry, avhich assumed that the affair would be allowed to blow over : and Khare, the Premier, attributes it to the prejudice and unfairness of Vallabhai Patel, whose influence is strong in the Parlia-mentary Sub-Commit (tie.
32. Of the Congress Ministries that in the N.-W. F. P. is least, amenable to central control. The Premier himself is a man of robust personality, and has been outspoken in his resentment of central interference.. In spite of the standing- orders forbidding attendance at social functions, he and all his colleagues attended the formal arrival of the Governor-General at Peshawar as well as the Garden Party at Government House and the State banquet. Khan Sahib had already been in conflict with Nehru over his action (much criticised in Hindu circles) in re-instating a Muslim official who had been imprisoned for complicity in the kidnapping of a Hindu girl. Nehru asked for his explanation : Khan Sahib replied curtly that he had given the matter full consideration, and if Nehru was not satisfied he could send a commission to examine the facts. Gandhi&apos;s Secretary, Mahadev Desai., did in fact go to Peshawar, apparently to investigate this affair and others. Gandhi himself is shortly due in Peshawar : and it will be interesting to see whether his visit modifies the Premier&apos;,? independence.33. The Orissa crisis over the designation of Mr. Dain as officiating Governor has been dealt with elsewhere (para. 11). The dictation of the &quot;Working-Committee has reduced the Ministry &apos;s part in the crisis to a cipher : and if, as appears to he the case, the Ministries in other Provinces were not consulted before Gandhi and Subhas Bose published their threats of repercussions through-out India, the dictators have carried matters with a high hand.34. The Speaker of the Madras Assembly had arranged to go to London to study Parliamentary practice (as to which he has shown himself badly in need of instruction). The Government were prepared that he should do so at the public expense. His farewells in the Assembly had been said, amid a chorus of amiable speeches. The &quot;Working Committee then peremptorily forbade the visit, on the pretext that such action by a Congressman would be inconsistent with opposition to the new Constitution.35. The &quot; Vidya Mandir &quot; scheme. The Congress party professes to have taken an interest in national education ever since 1906, and at the Haripura session in February the &quot;Working Committee passed a resolution laying down the principles on which basic education in the primary and secondary stages should be imparted, and authorised two persons (under the advice and guidance of Gandhi) to create an all-India Education Board in order to work out a programme. This was the Congress Centre &apos;s first recog-nition of a scheme which appears to have originated partly from Gandhi and partly from Pandit Shukla, the Education Minister in the Central Provinces. Shukla had had a scheme in view since July 1937, and in October a conference was held at Wardha under Gandhi&apos;s presidency to discuss it. Although the Education Board lias apparently issued no programme; the scheme, which goes by the name of &quot; Vidya Mandir &quot;, will shortly be given a start in the Central Provinces, where (the Assembly voted the entire budget demand for education on this under-standing.The essential points of the &quot; Vidya Mandir &quot; scheme are that the schools to be built will be self-supporting-, as pupils will be instructed in handicrafts and cottage industries as. well as receiving educational instruction in their mother tongue ; the articles they make will be sold and the proceeds will go to the maintenance of the schools. Each school is to have one teacher only, who will draw a living wage from the produce of the plot of land attached to the school. The Working Committee laid down as one of their principles that free and compulsory education should be provided for seven years. In the Central Provinces 166 of these schools or &quot; Vidya Mandirs &quot; are to be opened as a first step.The scheme has been criticised as unpractical : it is hoped that generous landowners Avill be prepared to give the land required for the schools free of charge, and if the response is not encouraging the scheme will require an enormous initial expenditure : the organisation required for selling- the students&apos; productions will have to be extensive and has probably not yet been caret&apos;idly thought out : Muslims claim that their opinion has been ignored and look upon the exclusively Hindu name with suspicion. Shukla has met the last objection by promising to give a different name to schools in Mttslim areas. Five thousand candidates are said to have applied for the 166 posts of teachers, and the selected candidates are receiving training at a special school at Wardha recently opened by Gandhi. Though no other Ministry has yet committed itself, the scheme is receiving consideration in Bihar, Madras and the United Provinces and the connection of Gandhi and the Working Committee with it requires all Congress Ministries to give it their attention.
36. Use of Hindi. It is an article of faitli that Congress shall adopt Hindi as the national language of India, and Congress Ministries are under an obliga-iion to achieve this end. Their path is, however, beset with difficulties. Muslims claim that Urdu is the lingua franca of India, and regard i the popularisation of Hindi as yet another sign of the totally Hindu complexion of the Congress party. The Madras Ministry have made Hindi a compulsory subject in a number of schools in the Presidency, in spite of Muslim opposition and of expert objection to a new language being foisted on a Province where, amid a number of vernaculars, English is the only common tongue. The Education Minister has found it convenient to refer to Hindi and Hindustani (Urdu) as if they were identical.((e) Relations of Ministries with Governors: social contacts : special responsi-bilities.37. There is little fresh to say about the relations between Governors and their Ministries; The circumstances in which Sir Hyde Gowan left the Central Provinces, and his death shortly after, called forth expressions of feeling from the Province which were remarkable for their Avarmth and spontaneity. In this chorus the Ministry joined : and it was clear that the cordiality of the relations between the Governor and the Ministry had been highly prized by the latter. Governors continue to preside, as a normal practice, at Cabinet meet-ings, at which harmonious relations have as a rule prevailed. Only in one case  in Orissa has the Governor had to complain of any lack of courtesy or con-siderafion from hi&quot; Ministers and on this occasion frank discussion soon led to a better understanding. It is reported from the Central Provinces that the main discussion of the business of the Cabinet takes place at private meetings before they meet the Governor : but where a real difference of opinion exists the Gov-ernor has considerable scope for influencing the final decision.38. As regards ceremonial contacts, when Sir Hyde Gowan was to leave the Central Provinces the Ministers expressed their willingness to see him off at the station, but the special arrangements necessitated by his sudden depar-ture made this impossible. They were persuaded rather reluctantly to meet the mew Governor, Mr. Bomford, at Government House and to attend the assump-tion ceremony, though they did not meet him at the station. The Premier said that owing to the very hurried arrangements which had to be made they had no time to get Vallabhai PatePs consent, and that their action was not to be taken as a precedent. As regards social contacts, the Premier had remarked to Sir Hyde Gowan before he left the province that all restrictions should be abolish-ed as they were clearly out of date ; if this were not done, he considered that they would become a dead letter.An important development has been the behaviour of the North-&quot;West Frontier Province Ministers on the occasion of the Viceroy&apos;s recent visit. The Peshawar District Board&apos;s Intention to join the Municipal Committee in pre-senting an address of welcome was frustrated by the veto of the Congress Work-ing Committee. This caused great annoyance to the Premier (Dr. Khan Sahib) : and he was resolved to resign if the &quot;Working Committee attempted to Interfere with the plans which he had made for the conduct of the Ministry. In fact there was no interference : the Ministry were present at the railway station at H. E.&apos;s formal arrival and remained throughout the usual ceremonies : they attended the State Banquet given in his honour by the Governor : and the responsible Ministers were present at public functions which concerned their departments. One Abdul Qaiyum, Congress member of the Central Assembly and a resident of Peshawar, took it on himself to issue a statement that this conduct was not in disobedience of the &quot; High Command &quot;, since the latter had issued no orders. It is not to be supposed, however, that the &quot; High Command &quot; Is pleased : and it may be expected that Gandhi during his forthcoming visit to the Province will have something to say to Khan Sahib on the subject.During the Central Assembly session, the Viceroy renewed his contacts with the Congress Parliamentary leaders. Bhulabhai Desai and Satyamurti, his lieutenant, were accorded Interviews.39. Special Responsibilities.- The occasions in the quarter when a Gov-ernor&apos;s exercise of his special responsibility has come to notice have been few, and unimportant in comparison with the circumstances of the U. P.-Bihar crises described elsewhere. In that affair the decision (on the official side) lay with the Governor-General in his discretion as the two Governors could not say that their special responsibility was attracted.   On the Congress side the decision:ls38hd
similarly lay with the Working Committee : and it is becoming increasingly clear that even in matters of mainly local interest the Working Committee are prepared to exploit the threat of a general resignation of Congress Ministries in order to enforce compliance with their own wishes or prejudices where the Act places the final decision in the hands of the Governor or a higher authority. This tendency has recently again been in evidence in the artificial all-India crisis which was created on the subject of Mr. Dain&apos;s appointment as acting Governor of Orissa.So far the difficulty has not been seiiously felt in the field of provincial legls-lation : and in fact the instance (discussed in para. 80) of the N. W. F. P. repealing Bill illustrates action in the contrary sense of a-Ministry transferring its responsibilities to the Governor.v   (f) Relations of Ministries with their Secretariats : methods of business.40. Tn Chapter V (a) below reference is made to a considtation of Governors by the Governor-General on the strain imposed on Secretariat (and other) officers by the working of the new Constitution. That enquiry, when complet-ed, will afford material for the subject dealt with under this heading : and for the present mention will only be made of incidents that have come to notice otherwise.In Bihar Ministers are said to be reluctant to leave purely administrative matters to the permanent staff :- there are too few Ministers in this province, and even they are apt to neglect their work in favour of political propaganda.In Bombay in February the Ministers were said to be working better with their departments. At the end of March however an incident showed that sus-pieion had not altogether disappeared. The Governor appointed to an officiat-ing post of member of the Public Services Commission the officer who appeared to him most suitable. The appointment was made by him &quot; in his discretion &quot; and no Minister was therefore formally entitled to advise. The Ministers nevertheless protested and made use of the incident to declare that they were suspicious of the practice whereby Secretaries discussed matters with the Gov-ernor. The Governor therefore instructed his Secretaries to keep Ministers in-formed of matters they discussed with Mm.The Ministers in the North West Frontier Province have shown a desire to have a say in appointments to subordinate services. The special rules for the Police have delegated the power of appointing Sergeants, Inspectors and Sub-Inspectors to the Deputy Inspector General of Police. The Premier claimed that his approval must be obtained to first appointments of Inspectors and Sub-Inspectors. It is hoped that the Premier will be satisfied with an arrange-mcnt whereby the rules remain untouched, i.e., the Premier is given no formal right to interfere but Ministers will be informally consulted and in the event of a dispute the case will be referred to the Governor. The Ministers in this Province have on other occasions shown a tendency to undue interference with appointments, postings, and promotions.In -Orissa &quot;the Minister in charge of excise policy passed some orders with-out consulting Mr. Dain, the Revenue and Excise Commissioner, to which the latter rightly took exception ; this led to temporarily strained relations. When an officer had to be selected to fill the post which Mr. Dain would vacate on becoming Governor, the Ministry wished to appoint a junior officer, and resent-ed the Governor&apos;s intervention and selection.III.-NON-CONGRESS PROVINCES.(a) Ministries : stability and reputation.41. Assam.-Sir Muhammad Saadulla, the Premier, decided early in February that there was no alternative to the plans for the reorganisation of the Cabinet described in the last survey (para. 30), if the Ministry was to remain stable. Wahid, the Education Minister, refused to resign ; as the passenger was not willing to&apos; jump overboard, the Premier ran the ship aground. On February 4th, he and the whole Ministry resigned ; he was at once invited to form a new Ministry, which he did, replacing Wahid and Ali Haidar (Minister for Agriculture) by Munawar Ali and Abdul Matin, and in
\addition co-opting a new Minister, A. Kumar Das, to represent the depressed classes. The new Minister agreed to accept a salary of Hs. 750 per mensem  half the amount originally fixed for Ministers : this is being cozitributed by the other five so that no extra expense is incurred. The new Ministry entered office on February 5th ; on February 21st, a motion of no-confidence was moved against them at the instigation of the two eo^Ministers, who are believed to have put up large sums of money for the purpose ; the Ministry survived by the margin of one vote, and since then have shown signs of increased stability. The leader of the Congress opposition has made efforts to secure a coalition, but the Working committee have forbidden hini to do so until he can be certain that such a Ministry would carry out the entire Congress programme. The Premier is confident of his own.ability to meet this attack, and has earned the commendation of the Muslim League for withstanding the Congress assaults.42. Bengal.- In February the Ministry were settling down well to their work arid were getting over their tendency to make ill-considered commitments In the Legislature. The apprehension of a coalition with the more moderate elements of Congress had a steadying affect on the Premier in particular, and helped to give the Ministry much-needed unity. Since the beginning of March Congress intrignes to form &amp;&apos; coalition have been insistent. At first one of the Congress groups was trying to win over Sarkar, the Finance Minister, but the Ministerial crisis in Bihar and the United Pro-vinces served to instil into the Muslims in Bengal a greater fear of a coalition, and the Ministers exchanged guarantees of solidarity. -Later, during Gandhi &apos;s visit to Calcutta, there was continuous speculation as to the chances of a coali-tion with Congress, and Fazlul Haq, the Premier, announced in April that Congress had more than once offered him the Premiership in a coalition cabinet an offer which he had refused because he woidd have &quot; signed the death warrant of Islam &quot; by accepting. The Congress party in Bengal is split into warring groups which the Congress leaders, (including, it is believed, Gandhi) have vainly tried to reconcile. The working Committee are under-stood to oppose the formation of a coalition in the province at present because the party has not the required strength to ensure the adoption of their pro-gramme.Another danger to the Ministry was the attitude of the European group to the Tenancy Bill, which they refused to support unless it were modified. The Premier was considering a Cabinet reshuffle in order to win over eertaiu wavering votes, but the danger passed Avhen the European Group decided to remain neutral.The attitude of Nausher Ali, Minister for Local Self-Government, has also been a source of anxiety. His colleagues are suspicious of his left-wing sympathies, and he does not get on well with the Ministers under the influence of Nazimuddin, the Home Minister. His opposition to the appointment of a European as Chairman of the Land Revenue Commission nearly led to his resignation, but at the end of April he was still in office. The Muslim League have publicly congratulated the Bengal Ministry for countering Congress manoeuvres, and the Ministry appears to be in a firm position. The threat of hysterical agitation over detenus and &quot; political &quot; convicts has induced the Ministry to treat with Gandhi and accelerate releases.Fazlul Haq&apos;s retention of the Premiership for a year, and apparent security in the tenure, have belied expectations based on his past career. An irresponsible strain still appears from time to time : and his public utterances (as-at the Muslim League Conference at Calcutta) are apt to be blatant, both in communal tone and otherwise.43. Punjab. Although Congress propaganda in certain rural areas is said to be having its effect, that party is far too weak, both numerically and by reason of dissensions, to attempt to overthrow the Government. The Ministry co-operate well and internal differences are unnoticeable. A few minor surrenders have been made to- popular sentiment but no more than might be regarded as inevitable. The binding force is the personality of Sir Sikandar Hayat, the Premier. He has won universal respect, his hold over his party is firm, and he has been able to keep the loyalty of his Hindu and Sikh supporters. Chotu Ram, Minister for Development, exercises an influence over the rural Hindus which counteracts that of Congress. The Punjab Ministry has a right to be considered the best balanced in India : not only is its communal composi-tion representative, but the level of ability and character among the Ministers is more even than elsewhere : the Ministry gives the impression of working as a team rather than asa&quot; one-man &quot; administration or a group of individualists. The. main threat to the stability of the Premier&apos;s position, and that of his
Ministry, comes from the ever-present danger of communal passion : so long as the Shahidganj dispute in particular (see para. 102) remains unsettled, the Ministry is not free to devote its full attention to a constructive programme.The Press in the Punjab is largely hostile to the Ministry ; and the repres-sive action taken against it, particularly on the ground of promoting com-munal discord, gives a handle for representation of the Ministry as following the path marked out by the old bureaucratic administrations.44. Sind. The Ministry, which was never secure, collapsed in March. For most of the past year one section of Muslims, headed by Allah Baksh, remained in opposition to the Ministry, but so long as the Premier had the support of the non-Congress Hindus he was safe. The appointment of Dr. Wadhwani as the Hindu Minister in place of Govind Ram, (see para. 33 of the last survey) led to a division in &quot;the Hindu ranks, which was the beginning of the end. Sir G. H. Hidayatullah, the Premier, tried manoeuvring for Muslim support, but his tactics, together with his vacillating policy, alienated a number of his supporters ; they resigned from, his party and joined hands with the Congress oppostion to reject the budget demand under the head of &quot; General Administration &quot;. This was regarded as a vote of censure and the Ministry resigned on March *21st.    .The Congress Opposition, numbering only eight in a house of sixty, were advised by the Working Committee not to attempt a coalition. After a certain amount of party manoeuvring a Ministry was formed consisting as before of two Muslims and one Hindu, as follows :-Khan Bahadur Allah Baksh Mohammad Umar, O.B.E., Premier.Pir Elahi Baksh.Nichaldas Vazirani.The first two belong to the United Muslim Group with a following of about twelve, and Vazirani to the Independent Hindus who number about ten. Allah Baksh is a big landowner and a Parliamentarian with experience in the Bombay Legislature, but has no experience of office. Elahi Baksh is an advocate, earnestly anxious to serve his country, but without political experience. Vazirani is a fairly successful lawyer but not one of Sind&apos;s most influential Hindus ; he has ability but is primarily a &quot; careerist &quot;, and has Congress sympathies.Though this Ministry must still be considered non-Congress, its assumption of protective colouring seems likely to render its policy indistinguishable in various respects from that adopted in Congress Provinces. The Congress party has indicated that, so long as the Ministry&apos;s programme meets with its approval, it will not raise opposition in the Legislature. The Ministry&apos;s strength of twenty-two in a House of sixty makes it in fact dependent on ex-ternal support : and the small Congress party derives strength from a spirit of solidarity and discipline which seems to be unlmown to other parties in the Province.(b) Ministries&apos; programmes.45. Assam. The financial position of this province is a cause of anxiety ; the revenue amounts to about two and a half crores of rupees, and Saadulla, -the Premier and Finance Minister, has budgetted for a deficit of four and a half lakhsl The writing off of irrecoverable Government loans and remissions of land revenue have decreased income, and there has been extra expenditure on the legislature : all this has made the position rather worse than it was last year. Consequently there is no possibility of any lavish programme.46. Bengal. Provincial revenues are about thirteen crores, and the Finance Minister has estimated a deficit of eleven lakhs in the budget. &quot; Prohibition &quot; will cause a small loss of revenue, and Government are exploring the possibilities of new taxation. About a crore of rupees will be spent on new schemes, the most important of which is an ambitious road development programme.Agrarian measures and the problem of the release of detenus and terrorist convicts have taken up -much of the Ministry&apos;s attention (see paragraphs S9 and 93). A commission to examine the land revenue system has recently been appointed.- 47. Punjab. The revised estimates for the past year showed an improve-ment on the budget estimates/ and the Finance Minister has estimated a budget
surplus of about five lakhs of rupees for the current year. The provincial revenues amount to about 114 crores. Three quarters of a lakh will be spent on the new Haveli irrigation project, and there will be increased expenditure on hydro-eleci ric works and on rural sanitation measures. A committee has been appointed to examine new sources of revenue and possibilities of effecting economy.&quot; Prohibition &apos;.&apos; is likely to be introduced in one or two districts as an experi-. ment.48. Sind. Provincial revenues are about three and a half crores of rupees. Plidayatullah, the lale Premier and Finance Minister, estimated a budget sur-plus of a lakh and a half. A tax on betting at the races in Karachi was con-&apos; templated.The old Ministry had no well-defined policy ; the new Ministry announced its programme on March 29th. It includes the abolition of honorary magis-trates and of nominations to local bodies, the usual promise of security for minorities, and payment of emoluments to Ministers on the same scale as in Congress provinces. . The Congress principle of accepting no social entertain-ments has also been adopted. These items are taken from the recognised Congress programme, and with a Ministry dependent on Congress favour for its existence it is probable that more of that jjrogramme will be adopted,(c) Legislatures : events of the Sessions.49. Assam. The Assembly budget session lasted from February 15th to March 5th. The early history of the cut-an tne budget demand for the Commis-sioners&apos; staff was described in the last survey (para. 38). The supplementary demand for 1937-38 was presented on March. 4tn and refused : on the following day the Congress party Avaiked out as a protest when  the Premier presented the authenticated schedule of expenditure containing this item. The budget for 1938-39 was passed in full except for the demand for the Commissioners&apos; staff which was again included in the authenticated schedule. The Ministry narrowly escaped disaster when a motion of no-confidence was rejected by one vote on February 21st.   Since then the opposition seem to have been discouraged.The Legislative Council held a short session from February 15th to the 19th, and decided to accept the Members&apos; Emoluments Bill in the form in which it was originally passed by the Assembly that is, a monthly allowance of Rs. 100 and (during the sessions) a daily allowance of Rs. 5. So ended the dispute between the two Houses mentioned in the last survey (para. 38).50. Bengal. The Assembly budget session lasted from February 7th to April 8th. The Council session which began on January 24th continued till April 2nd. The only important legislation passed was the Tenancy Amendment Bill, (see para. 93) which went through both Houses. In the Assembly Gov-ernment suffered one defeat when the motion for considering the Speaker &apos;s Salary Bill, as amended by the Upper House, was rejected. The budget was passed. An adjournment motion to discuss the appointment of an English Chair-man to the Land Revenue Commission was defeated.There has been a realignment of parties in the Assembly. One Tazimuddin and twelve others voted against the Government when the question came up of appointing the Land Revenue Commission, and were promptly excluded from party meetings. They then formed a separate group with which Congress started to negotiate. Shortly afterwards, the Scheduled Castes party, about twenty-four in number, after discussions with Gandhi set itself up independently ; they had previously been co-operating with the Ministerial party. In spite of these defections, the Ministry won two convincing victories on issues specially selected by the Opposition to test their strength, and the session closed without any other alarms.51. Punjab. The Assembly budget session lasted from February 23rd to April 11th. The budget was passed without a cut. A resolution which stated that the Federal scheme is &quot;unsatisfactory&quot; was passed. Further progress was made with the Rules of Procedure for the House. The only other incident worth mentioning was the Premier&apos;s defence of the Ministry&apos;s policy in regard to the Shahidgamj dispute-(see para. 102). The Government suffered no defeats and demonstrated its solidarity to a subdued opposition.52. Sind. The Assembly budget session began on February 25th. When the Ministry resigned on March 21st the Governor prorogued the Assembly, and tlie session recommenced on March 25th and closed on March 31st. After the new Ministry had taken office the budget was passed in full.LS iiKD
(d) Relations of Ministries with Governors : social contacts : special responsi-bilities.53. The relations of all non-Congress Ministries with their Governors are satisfactory, and social contacts are unhampered. Governors ordinarily pre-side over Cabinet meetings, and special responsibilities have not been called into play.In the Punjab the public endorsement by the Premier Of the Governor &apos;s action in withholding&apos; sanction to.the introduction of the Bill which was the out-come of the judicial decision on the Shahidganj question (see para. 102) led to some misrepresentation of the Ministers&apos; relation to the Governor&apos;s exercise of his &quot; discretion &quot; functions.(e) Relations of Ministries with their Secretariats : methods of business.(The remarks in para. 44 above apply to this section of the survey).54. Ministers&apos; relations with their Secretariat officers are good, in the Punjab particularly, where the Premier and some of his colleagues have ample experience of administration and the Premier has long been popular among the Services. The new Ministers in Sind do not all realise that their best friends should be the permanent Secretaries, and being over-confident in themselves are inclined to disregard their advice. The new Premier very soon began to corn-plain of being overworked. Popularity-hunting has led to a harvest of peti-tions of all kinds, the handling of which is a grievous and unprofitable task for the permanent officials.55. Methods of business. Ministers in all provinces are so busy, with party organisation and political propaganda to attend to in addition to their office duties, that new schemes and legislative measures are apt to suffer from in-sufficient consideration. This has been noticed in the Punjab as well as in Bengal, where the discussions on the preparation of the budget are said to have shown a grave lack of proportion. Some Ministers in Bengal have not yet learnt the impropriety of attempting to influence district officers in their dealings with subordinate staff.IV.-CHIEF COMMISSIONERS&apos; PROVINCES.56. A question that has been under consideration is the adequacy and suit-ability of the legislative machinery provided for the Chief Commissioners&apos; Pro-vinces under the new Constitution. About the Andamans there is no difficulty, since the Governor-General in his discretion has power to make regulations for the peace and good government of this Province as for Baluchistan. Coorg has its own Legislative Council. In Delhi Province it is possible for the Central Government by notification to extend, with such modifications as are necessary, the provisions of any enactment in force elsewhere in British India. The defects of this arrangement are two first, Delhi &apos;s problems are not all such as can be met by adaptation of laws in force elsewhere : in particular, the needs of the old 0 ity and the fast-growing- new City call for measures speciallv designed and not merely imitative ; secondly, it is unsuitable even now, and &quot;will be even more so under Federation, that every such measure should have to pass through the Central Legislature, which is and will be fully occupied with matters of larger scope and will be liable to treat local measures less&apos; on their merits than from political and other irrelevant aspects. The position as regards Ajmer-Merwara is worse, since there is now no power of enactment by notification, and all measures will have to go to the Central Legislature. This Province also has problems, both municipal and agrarian, of some importance and urgency.Mention will now be made of administrative matters that have arisen in each Province.57. Apner-Menvara. Mild agitation for constitutional reforms has con-tinued ; a body set up by the local Congress Committee recommended unani-ir:ously in February that the province should be amalgamated with the United Provinces, and another committee has since been appointed to further this amal-gamation... This demand was supported by the all-India Congress in a resolution passed at Haripura (see Appendix). Congress influence is weakened by internal dissensions and personal iealousy. Recentlv a Rajas than Congress Progressive Party has been formed with the object of &quot; helping &quot; the Indian States, but this is frowned on by the orthodox Congress party.   Congress self-confidence was
shaken by a-meeting of some 4,000 Muslims who made a display of hoisting theirone party of volunteers to Lahore in February, but the Muslim League&apos;s opposi-tion to these tactics restrained-their efforts, and only one more party was sent, at the end of March. Little has been heard of Palestine, elderly because the Shahidgani issue has been of more pressing importance^ , 1JS   .58. Coorg. The Oborg Council held its budget session m the first half of March. The Chief Commissioner made it clear that the Central &quot;Government would not consider any constitutional changes until the Province could meet the expense involved, and that no subvention could be expected for this purpose. The Madras Accountant-General has been deputed to hold an enquiry into the Provincial finances ; his report is likely to demon-strate that the Province is quite unable to bear the burden of any extra expendi-ture such as constitutional reforms would entail.59. Delhi. Early in February the Delhi Provincial Congress: Committee sent a request to the All-India Congress Committee that they should be authorised to adopt necessary measures to &quot;terminate the anomaly of autocratic Govern-ment in Delhi A resolution passed by the All-India Congress at Haripura condemned this administration. (See Appendix.) At the same time the Provin-cial Committee urged the formation of a new province to include Delhi, Ajmer-M rwara, and certain portions of the Punjab and the United Provinces. So far as is known the All-India Congress Committee have not responded. Congress in Delhi is vocal but not effective. A Socialist Conference held in April attracted little attention and poor audiences.The local Ahrars openly criticised the Shahidganj judgment and despatched a number of volunteers to Lahore.On two occasions communal disturbances in Delhi city were narrowly averted ; the prompt action of the police prevented serious trouble.Labour trouble raised its head in Delhi at the end of January ; the Textile Labour Union was captured by a body of extremist workers, and a strike in the Birla Mills was followed by a lockout and picketing. There were some minor disturbances in February, but the injudicious and ill-organised strike gradually petered out and by March 7th, it was over : the management agreed to re-instate all the workers except twenty. Extremist agitation in the rural areas has need-ed watching : and recently the most violent of the speakers, a woman called Satyavati, has been charged with sedition.60. Tlie Andaman Islands. The influence of the deported terrorists was responsible for a half-hearted hunger strike by three convicts, in February ; two of them abandoned it after two days and the third shortly afterwards.The number of convicts in the Settlement has been steadily decreasing ; in the first quarter of 1938 only 55 were received from provinces in India, compared with 140 in the corresponding period of 1937. This decrease was expected, as the Congress Provinces are no longer willing to send convicts as volunteers to the Andamans see paragraph 44 of the last survey. The problem of finding man-power for the Settlement is already being felt, and is likely to become more serious as time goes on.61. Panth Piploda. An apology is due to Panth Piploda for its omission in previous surveys. It is, however, difficult to remember that this small area, an obscure and somewhat primitive tract in the midst of a number of Indian States, is a &quot; Chief Commissioner^ Province &quot;. It has only come to view through a proposal, due to the incongruity of the present arrangement, that it should be absorbed in the adjoining- State area. The majority of&apos;the inhabitants-, like those of other isolated fragments of British India which have from time to time boon proposed for transfer to States, have shown a flattering but inconvenient disintegration-clination to be parted from British India ; and the proposal has therefore been dropped.(a) Treatment of the Services ; Service feeling : Services&apos; pay and allowances.62. In non-Congress provinces relations between all Services and Ministers continue to be good, especially in the Punjab.   From Bengal it has been reportedV. GENERAL
that the presence of distinct officers at meetings at which touring Ministers make strong party speeches causes some embarrassment, as the officers&apos; presence,gives the impression that they support the Ministers&apos; views. In the Punjab certain officers have shown some doubt as to the attitude they should adopt to party polities, being embarrassed in particular by the fear of appearing partisans if they interfere with Congress propaganda directed against the Minis-try, even where that propaganda may be prejudicial to public order.63, In Congress Provinces the improvement in the attitude to the Services has on the whole been maintained. In Bihar the Premier agreed to Issue a letter of thanks to officers in three turbulent districts for the manner in which they handled the agrarian situation in December and January. The Ministry have not shown any desire to oust Government servants from the control of the staff appointed for some of their new schemes : for example, district officers will be chairmen of the Advisory Boards set up under the Sugar Control Act. In the 17, p. the Premier has acknowledged the services of officials in the disturbances mentioned elsewhere. In Bombay even Desai, the Revenue Minister, whoso vindictive attitude to Mr. Garret! is described in para. 118, is said to have admitted that ho was receiving full co-operation from the Services and that his early suspicions were unfounded. Congress relations with the police in this province have also Improved, as Munshi, the Home Minister, is now prepared to back them up. There is a general improvement in the Congress attitude in the Central Provinces : the Ministry seem to be satisfied that, they are receiving officers&apos; loyal co-operation, and speeches contained advice to Congress workers to co-operate with Government servants. The. Premier issued an appeal in February calling on the public to approach district officers with their complaints instead of coming&apos; direct to Ministers. In Madras there are few complaints among the Services. The Premier has no hesitation in showing a preference for British officers for particular duties s&apos; he desired a British Collector, Superintendent of Police, and Excise offieer to launch the &quot; prohibition *&apos; enterprise In Salem district : and he particularly requested the Governor to ask the Chief Justice to appoint an English I. C. S. Judge of the High Court to conduct the enquiry into the Chirala riot (see para, 79).64. These are instances on the credit side, but it must not be supposed that there is nothing to set against them. Indian officials in the North-West Frontier Province suspect the Ministry of trying to demonstrate that an official must look to Congress for advancement, and there have been instances of political bias influencing appointments. In some Provinces the drive against corruption in the Services has shown bias against officials as a class and has given opportunities for intrigue against individuals. The agitation against the appointment of Mr. Dain ps Governor of Orissa has been discussed (in para. 11),65. A year*s experience of the working- of the new Constitution provides material for a review of its effect on the Services. Apart altogether from any conscious or unconscious animus against the Services on the part of Ministers or their supporters, the new administrations Inevitablv brought the need for adjustments in the official machine, and imposed fresh demands on it. The Governor-General, having noticed references to the growing strain imposed nn Provincial Secretariats, invited all Governors&apos; views on the questions whether the new order of things has increased the burden of Secretariat and&apos; district officers, what the causes of any such additional burden appear to be, \yhether key positions are suitably filled, and whether reserves of skilled personnel, particularly in the All-India Services, are adequate to deal with emergencies. The replies are not yet complete, and a full synopsis must therefore wait. But there appears to be substantial agreement on a number of points. Even in the non-Congress Provinces the strain on officers has increased. Generally this is true in a greater degree in the Congress Provinces. The reasons given for the additional burden are similar in most Provinces : the inexperience and sometimes the unbusinesslike habits of Ministers ; their susceptibility to the airing of grievances, many of which have been fully con-siderecl by their predecessors ; the great strain on Ministers themselves, result-ing in delay and -confusion ; legislation or executive action imposing additional duties on district officers ; the stress of new legislative proposals, often reqnir-ing the production of complicated Bills without time for proper consideration or drafting -r the inordinate number of questions in the legislatures and the increased length of the sessions. Governors agree however that the first few months. were the worst and that the position is likely to grow easier as time goes on and experience teaches its inevitable lessons. 1
(b) Interference with the administration : signs of parallel administration inthe districts.67. Instances of direct interference with the administration continue to occur in the United Provinces and a number of cases have been reported from the North-West Frontier Province. The Bihar Provincial Congress Committee issued instructions in March to their district committees to submit fortnightly summaries of peasant and labour enquiries, so that the Committee could furnish the required information to higher authorities, and so that *&apos; their organisation may prove to be a parallel government &quot;. In the Central Provinces, where the Ministry&apos;s interference in legal processes has become notorious, Government at the end of January ordered the withdrawal of four cases instituted as a result of a clash (between Gongress and non-Congress groups, apparently with the desire to save the Congress supporters among the accused.In the North-West Frontier Province a February report stated that &quot; Red Shirts &quot; were actively interfering in criminal investigations ; in March the same persons were said to be endeavouring to compromise as many eases as possible in order to prevent reports reaching the police, including a murder case in which evidence was ultimately obtained with difficulty. Similar cases were reported in April.In the United Provinces in February Congress workers in one district announced their intention of setting up committees to which cases of dacoity, theft and murder would be reported, and only if a committee thought it neces-sary would a report be sent to the police. In another district Congress workers proposed to establish forty-eight centres for registering crime reports ; and interference in investigations was reported from two other districts. In April Congressmen in various districts established panchayats intended even-tnally to boycott the police and the courts.T ooonrvLS38HD66. Services&apos; pay and attmvances.-No further progress has been made with the Bombay Governments proposals for reducing the salaries of the Services, nor have any definite proposals been put forward in other provinces. But in Bihar a Retrenchment Committee has been appointed to consider &quot; the reorganisation of the Services and the fixing, if possible, of pay and allow-ances &quot; : and in Orissa the Retrenchment Committee in its interim report has recently recommended some drastic reductions which would particularly affect the pay  of European police sergeants and Anglo-Indian clerks in the provincial O. 1. I).In the Central Provinces, as a result of the reduction of allowances given to police officers in certain districts as compensation for dear living, some of the Nagpur town police refused for some days to accept their pay for March. The reduction is said to be general for Government servants employed in those districts but to affect the police in particular. However well justified in principle, its immediate introduction in full has meant a considerable loss in emoluments.The Madras Premier is making a further attempt to reduce expenditure by attacking the salaries of new entrants to the provincial Public Service Corn-mission. He wishes to reduce the salary of the Chairman from Rs. 3,000 to Rs. 2,000 and of members from Rs. 2,000 to Rs. 1,500. The salaries are fixed by the Governor in his discretion. If a reduction were sanctioned in Madras the lead would be followed in other Provinces. All Governors have therefore been consulted on the proposal. The Importance of preserving the Independence of Service Commissions is recognised.   No final decision has yet been made.The Bihar Government have worked out proposals for reducing officers&apos; travelling allowances which are estimated to save one lakh of rupees annually. Most of the proposals are not unreasonable ; they Include a reduction in road mileage allowance, in the special daily allowance paid to certain senior officials, and in the railway allowance. A feature of the proposals which needs parti-cular mention is the alteration of the classification of officials who are permitted lo travel by first class on railways ; hitherto any officer earning Rs. 500 a month or more has been placed in that grade, and the proposal is to raise the limit to Rs. 750 ; the result would be that young I. C. S. and Indian Police officers would have to travel by second class. From this particular change the savings would be negligible. At the moment of writing it is not certain which of the various proposals have actually been introduced.
It is not intended to suggest that these practices are general, or that they seriously hamper the administration : but instances are quoted to show that, especially in some Provinces, Congress workers have not yet learnt their place.68. Rural Development Schemes. The personnel appointed under this scheme in the United Provinces included an ea;-convict in the notorious Chauri-Chaura case and a hooligan under police surveillance. There was a wide-spread belief that the scheme was intended chiefly for political propaganda. Since the resignation in February of the Rural Development Officer (a member of the Central Assembly, of an unpleasant and wholly unsuitable type) the Ministry&apos;s attitude has changed for the better. They agreed to the &quot;issue of instructions to the effect that the staff must conform to the Government Ser-vants&apos; Conduct Rules and take no part in politics, and came round to the view that without the co-operation of district officers the scheme was doomed to failure. The appointment of an official to take charge of the work is being considered : in the meantime the scheme seems to be held up.At the beginning of April, Dr. Mahmud, the Education Minister of Bihar, produced a somewhat similar scheme for rural development, involving the appointment of &quot; village guides &quot; and &quot; welfare officers &quot; ; the scheme is still being considered.69. Local Self-Government Reform. In the Central Provinces, Misra&apos;s scheme (mentioned in the last survey) has made no progress. In February the Governor agreed to his publishing it, and it is believed to have won the general approval of the Congress President though certain items are considered impracticable.The United Provinces Government appointed a second committee to examine the possibility of reforms. Its recommendations were received in April, and suggested that the whole rural area should be given the benefits of local self-government, that adult franchise should be introduced, and that nomina-tions to boards should be abolished. The report stated that the control exercised by Commissioners and District Magistrates had not been conducive to good administration, and suggested the establishment of a local self-govern-ment board with a strong inspectorate. It also proposed that a police force be created for the execution of local bodies&apos; orders. The Government&apos;s findings on these proposals have not yet been issued.70. Volunteer Police. The Bombay and Central Provinces Governments have put forward proposals for the formation of volunteer police corps. Neither proposal has so far been acted upon. In Bombay the scheme is not palpably subversive ; the volunteer corps would form part of the ordinary police service and would be subject to the control of the police machinery ; the Home Minister stated that it would definitely not form part of the Congress party organisation.   It is intended to assist the police in times of emergency.In the Central Provinces a &quot; Civic Guards Bill &quot; was hastily drafted early in March. The Bill provided for the enrolment of volunteers up to 2,000 in each district of the province, to be selected by specially constituted district beards, which would also make arrangements for training the &quot; Civic Guard &quot;. The powers and privileges of members of the Guard were to be the same as those of the police. At the instance of the Premier it was provided that the District Magistrate and Superintendent of Police should be at the head of the boards, and the force was to be put under their orders. Local bodies were expected to find the whole cost of the scheme, and to this Municipal Boards would probably never have agreed. The Bill never passed beyond the embryo stage and consideration of it has been postponed indefinitely.The so-called &quot; Congress Police Force &quot; in Bihar, referred to in the last survey (para. 50), turned out on investigation to be little more than an elec-tioneering agency intended to deal with left-wing opposition, in spite of the fact that it was under the charge of an ea;-terrorist. Its aetivities are being watched but so far have not been objectionable.(c\ Parliamentary Secretaries.71. There have been no important developments.(d) Attitude of Ministries to law and order : reporting of speeches :   &quot; repres-sive &apos;&apos; legislation and restrictions, etc.72. There has been no alteration in the attitude of the non-Congress Ministries towards the maintenance of law and order.  In Bengal and   the
Punjab where serious disorder is always possible the portfolio is in safe hands. Assam has had to cope with no difficulties. In Sind, occasion has not yet arisen to test the effectiveness of the new Ministry ; but in accordance with its Congress leanings it has been pressing for the release of its one &quot; political &quot; prisoner (see para. 99). Bengal has been comparatively free from the communal disturbances which have caused so much anxiety elsewhere ; there has been no serious labour or agrarian disorder ; the Ministry&apos;went through a difficult period during the hunger-strike in January and February, but suffered no discredit ; this and then-policy concerning releases of prisoners and detenus are discussed in para. 89.73. Under the instructions of this Government a notoriously troublesome newspaper was prosecuted for sedition on the ground of an attack on the Ministry. The case ended in conviction and is now under appeal to the high Court whose decision will be of general interest since the application of section 124A of the Indian Penal Code to attacks on a Ministry is a matter on which there has not hitherto been an authoritative legal decision. The question of law is whether or not the Ministry, or a Minister, can under the new Constitution be considered &quot; the Government established by law in British India &quot;. it may be expected that the law of sedition, as bearing on political conflicts in the Provinces, will be a matter of uncertainty for some time : and it will be of interest to observe whether its ultimate interpretation will follow British precedent and, so far as attacks on the Ministry are concerned, punish only such as encourage violence.74. The Punjab Government have controlled the Shahidganj agitation (see para. 113) by systematic &quot; repressive &quot; measures ; and have given full support to district officers in their dealings with communal disturbances. They have made free use of the Press Act to demand securities from newspapers, parti-cularly for publishing articles likely to create communal excitement, and have not escaped vituperation for a policy markedly different from the freedom enjoyed in the Congress Provinces. A prominent Socialist who visited Lahore to attend a Socialist rally was promptly served with an order to quit the pro-vince, and was arrested and removed on disobeying the order.In the middle of March a serious disturbance occurred at Fatehwal, in the Amritsar district. Some weeks before, a Congress meeting held in this village had been subjected to some heckling ; when a second meeting was arranged, Congress supporters arrived armed with suitable weapons ; the meeting was peaceful but for a few interruptions ; but when it ended, the Congressmen with-out provocation attacked the villagers with brutal violence, killing one man and wounding several. Two Congress members of the Assembly were present. The Congress party at once issued their own version of the disturbance which exonerated their supporters, but a number of Congress accused are under trial. Congress are making unscrupulous attempts to give the case a political colouring and have formed a defence committee which intends to tour the area for pro-paganda purposes.75. The causes which led Congress Ministries, soon after their formation, to harden in their attitude towards violence and the advocacy of violence Avere mentioned in the last survey (para. 82). To these causes must noav be added the dread of communal disturbance aamich bitter experience has bred in some Ministries and in the Working Committee. Gandhi urges that violence can be cured, and can only be cured in accordance Avith Congress principles, by non-violence, carried if necessary to the pitch of self-immolation : but the Ministries prefer the less heroic method of reliance on the police and troops : and are more disposed than at first to seek to prevent outbreaks by using the proadsions of laav devised for that purpose.76. Bihar. The Ministry&apos;s attitude toAvards- the release of &quot; political &quot; prisoners is described in paras. 84 88. The agrarian trouble avhich avas the Ministry&apos;s main cause of anxiety has subsided.77. Bombay. Encouraged by the success of the methods employed to suppress labour disturbances, and by the conviction that Communist influence had been over-estimated, the Bombay Government put forAvard a proposal for the repeal of the Bombay Special (Emergency) poavers Act, 1932, as well as the Indian Press (Emergency poavers) Act-an All-India Act of 1931. the Governor agreed that the former Act could be repealed avithout danger, and the repealing Bill avas passed in April after very little discussion. The sug-gestion to repeal the Press Emergency poavers Act avas strongly discouraged, as it is the only legislation giving control of the press and action taken in Bombay avould have certainly been followed in other provinces. The Ministry agreed to abandon this proposal.TheGoArernment took strong measures to restore order during the com-munal riots in April (described in parai. 101), and served several neAvspapers
With orders under the restrictive section of the law preventing them from publishing inflammatory communal articles. The Home Minister has also announced that Government are not prepared to lift the ban on books which contain matter likely to cause communal bitterness. The only disturbance in which Communists were concerned, that in Sholapur, resulted in the arrest of all their leadens (see para. 94). The Ministry&apos;s policy towards the release of prisoners is described below (paras. 84 88).On the last day of April the Bombay Assembly passed a Bill to amend the Bombay Police Act by empowering the Commissioner of Police to extern hooli-gans from the city. The primary intention is to strengthen the hands of the police in dealing with communal riots. Thus in matters of policy the Bombay Ministry has shown wisdom. But the Home Minister (Munshi) has earned vigorous criticism by &quot;postponing by a fortnight the execution of a sen-fence of imprisonment passed by the High Court on two rich merchants (whose sympathies were alleged to be pro-Congress), on the ground that he wished to .allow them time to set their affairs in order. The publicity given to this indis-cretion is likely to have a salutary effect.78. Central Provinces. There have been no serious disturbances in this province outside Jubbulpore ; and in Jubbulpore the communal tension (des-cribed in para. 101) was prevented from turning into grave disorder by the stern measures adopted by the Government, including an order to the police to open fire on anyone seen attacking either person or property. The action of Sharif, the Law Minister, in releasing Zafar Husain has already been discussed (para. .8).79. Madras. Batliwala, whose conviction for sedition started the contro-versy about the attitude of Congress Ministries towards &quot; civil liberty &quot; (see para. 82 of the last survey), was prematurely released in March as an act of clemency ; the.Premier was convinced that his conviction had stopped violent speaking in the Presidency, and gave an assurance to the Governor, who was reluctant to agree to the release, that any further speeches of a like nature would be prosecuted.On February 14th a strike in a tobacco company at Chirala led to picketing and a disturbance, during Which the police opened hre, killing three people and wounding another. Mr. Justice Horwill of the Madras High Court was appointed -to enquire into this incident. His finding that the firing was justified has been accepted in a Government resolution published in the middle of April. The resolution also drew one important conclusion from the report, namely, that less lethal measures such as the employment of tear-gas are required in such cases. This statement is the more interesting because the Madras Government had declined to send a detachment to the Punjab for training in tear-gas methods at a special school. The position regarding the ttse of tear-gas in India is described below (parai. 83).This Government&apos;s novel use of the &quot; repressive &quot; section 144 of   the Criminal Procedure Code in the Madura labour trouble is described in para. 97. An instance of the &quot; repression of civil liberty &quot; in this Province is the recent banning of a revolutionary book (published in a vernacular) under the provisions of the Indian Press (Emergency Powers) Act.The problems of Madras in regard to public order are not as grave as those of some other Provinces : but in dealing with them the Ministry has shown marked cordklence in its own judgment and powers.80. North-West Frontier Province. Early in March the provincial Legis-lature distinguished itself by passing a private Bill which repeals section 124A of the Indian Penal Code (sedition), the Indian Press (Emergency Powers) Act, and most of the provincial Frontier Crimes regulation., and modifies two important preventive sections of the Criminal Procedure Code. The Premier had expressed to the Governor- his intention of getting the Bill withdrawn as he knew that it would never be allowed to become law, and he himself disapproved of it. However,&apos; he let it pass through Select Committee, and raised no voice against it in the Assembly. The Bill requires the assent of the Governor under section 75 of the Act, and this will be withheld. This will be the first instance of the use by a Governor of this power. However satisfactory the Premier&apos;s private assurances, his public attitude was unconstitutional, in that he relied on the Governor to kill a Bill which he himself was not willing to oppose in the legislature. The refusal of assent to the Bill is not expected to cause excite-ment.81. United Provinces. Violent speaking has not ceased in this province, but the speakers have not been men of note and the speeches do not appear to have had important effects.   Communal riots (described in para. 101) have given
the Ministry continual cause for anxiety ; and they are now willing to give district officers a free hand and have instructed them to take immediately any steps that may be necessary to avert this type of disorder. They have also taken steps to prevent the dissemination in the press of matter likely to excite com-munal feeling, and have sanctioned the prosecution of the editor of one newspaper for making a dangerous communal speech. The crisis resulting from the Ministry&apos;s attitude to the release of terrorists is discussed in paras. 84-88. Agrarian trouble of importance has not occurred : and the lull in labour agitation at Cawnpore has continued.In the other Provinces nothing calls for mention which has not been dealt, with elsewhere. .82. Reporting of speeches. The orders passed by the United Provinces Government in December (see para. 58 of the last survey) have been further amplified since the communal disturbances in March and April. The new orders issued on April 21st direct that as it may reasonably be presumed that speeches to be delivered by communal leaders or under the auspices of communal organi-sations will be such as will arouse ill-feeling between different communities, such speeches should as a rule be reported unless for special reasons the District Magistrate considers it unnecessary. The reports should be submitted to Gov-ernment as early as possible and particulars should be furnished about the speaker and the size of the meeting. These orders were issued at the instance of Pant, the Premier. .There have been no developments in other provinces.83. Tear-gas. The use of tear-gas for the dispersal of unlawful assemblies in India has for some time been under the consideration of the Government of India. The need for some humaner method than lathi charges and firing in dealing with riotous mobs has long been felt : but it would have been dangerous to use in emergencies any device which had not been proved to be effective and which police (and troops) were not trained to handle. The Punjab Govern-ment has been the pioneer in experiments in tear-gas : and at the end of 1936 the Secretary of State authorised the use of tear-gas, in that Province only, sub-ject to the conditions that suitable equipment and trained police were available and that the local Government were satisfied in each case that the occasion really demanded such measures and that the use of gas would stand a good chance of being used successfully. It was observed that if the Punjab used tear-gas in the near future, it would be the first occasion of its employment against crowds in the British Empire. If this experiment in the Punjab succeeded, the Secretary of State agreed that other provinces might later be permitted to use it on suitable occasions.With the introduction of provincial autonomy it has become a matter for Provincial Governments to decide whether the use of tear-gas should be authorised. It has been commended to tliem and they have been informed that the Punjab Government has agreed to hold a course to train officers of other Provinces to act as instructors in their own Provinces. Owing to unforeseen difficulties the course of training has been postponed till next winter : and it is not yet known how many Provincial Governments will avail themselves of. the opportunity, though a number have received the suggestion favourably, and the Bombay Government sent a detachment for training at a brief course held at short notice in February: The Madras Government have not accepted the offer, their reason being that the stringent conditions laid down for the use of tear-gas make its use impracticable ; but the Chirala enquiry (mentioned above) seems to have changed their mind. Tear-gas has already been effectively used in the Punjab, but only to put out of action desperate criminals who have taken refuge in buildings : no opportunity has yet been found for its employment against mob-violence.(e) &quot; Political &quot; Prisoners and Detenus.- 84. The hunger-strike (probably concerted) in the provinces of Bengal, Bihar and the Punjab mentioned in the last survey (paragraph 68), had some effect in producing the political crisis in the United Provinces and Bihar. At the beginning of February the number of prisoners on hunger-strike had risen to nineteen in Dacca &apos;vBengal), seventeen in Bihar, and twenty-one in the Punjab. A solitary prisoner in the United Provinces who had been on strike for some time attracted little attention and abandoned his strike on February 1st. On February 3rd the Congress Working Committee passed a resolution at Wardha disapproving of resort to hunger-strikes and urging all prisoners to abandonls38hd
them. On February 4th the Bengal strike was abandoned after the prisoners had been assured that their grievances would be examined. On February 8th after the Working Committee had sent messages to the prisoners in Bihar, they too gave up their strike. The strike in the Punjab lasted till February 26th ; it was then abandoned after Congress leaders had interviewed the convicts. The Ministries in Bengal and the Punjab stood firm against the agitation. In Bengal the problem facing the Ministry was serious ; that province held by far the largest number of terrorist convicts, 387 altogether, and an agitation similar to that excited in Bengal over the Andamans hunger-strike of July-August would have proved a grave ordeal for the Ministry and a boon to their Congress enemies. While the Ministry refused to yield to the hunger-stiikerS or to consider wholesale or indiscriminate release, they followed a course which had the approval of the Governor and of the Governor-General, namely to transfer all the detenus confined in the large camp at Berhampore to village or homo domicile ; to release a few carefully selected State prisoners ; to release some terrorists who were in jail only for breach of restrictive conditions im-posed under emergency legislation ; and to release a few selected terrorists as an act of clemency where only a short period of their sentence remained to be served.85. The Congress Ministries of the TJ. P. and Bihar were conscious of their helplessness against the hunger-strike weapon : and the fear of it induced the two Premiers early in February to press urgently on their respective Governors the immediate and unconditional release of their remaining &quot;political&quot; prisoners, numbering twenty-three in Bihar and fifteen in the United Provinces. It is understood that the Congress Working Committee authorised the Pre-miers to make this a major issue. The Committee had their own reasons for alarm, since they apprehended a strong attack from the Congress left wing at the All-India Congress session due to open in the middle of the month an attack which might prove overwhelming if the &quot; political &quot; prisoners were not only still in jail but on hunger-strike.While both Premiers were trying to force their Governors&apos; hands by threats of resignation, the Governor-General with the full concurrence of the Secretary of State instructed all Governors concerned that they should refuse absolutely any proposals for indiscriminate release, and should make no concessions to hunger-strikers, but should continue to consider individual cases for release with due deliberation. It was thought unlikely that Ministries would resign, but this course was to be followed even if it should lead to that contingency. The grounds for this policy may be briefly stated.All the political prisoners in the two Provinces most concerned had been convicted by the normal criminal courts, most of them for crimes of violence. There is obvious objection to the executive Government interfering, except on the normal and generous principles of remission for good conduct, with the sentences of criminal courts imposed after full consideration of facts. The indiscriminate reduction of sentences is liable to create contempt for the sanctity of the law. Notwithstanding these objections eighteen prisoners had in fact been released in Bihar and a number in the United Provinces, where the release of the Kakori dacoity convicts had been followed by unfortunate results. Although Governors had conceded so much, tfie Congress Ministries were not satisfied and now demanded both immediate and indiscriminate release of all remaining terrorists in jail, that is to say, release without any consideration of the length of sentence or gravity of the offence committed, and without any assurance of future good behaviour.Even if particular Governors could say that the release of their prisoners did not attract their special responsibility for the peace and trah-quillity of their own Provinces, the problem for the Governor-General still remained, since it is for him to control the executive authority of a Province in the interests of the. peace and tranquillity of India as a whole or any part thereof. In the Provinces of Bengal and the Punjab the number of terrorist prisoners was far larger than the total number confined in Congress Provinces. Tn the latter the total was about forty-five onlv, whereas the Punjab had forty-four and Bengal had three hundred and eighty-seven. Even though it might be ar**ued that the release of a score of convicts in one Province might have no ill effects, the same could not be said of Bengal at any rate, where the simul-taneous release of nearly four hundred prisoners would have created a grave menace to public order : and if Governors had yielded to the demand in the Conorcss provinces, the Bengal Government would have been faced with the
choice between surrender to a vastly more powerful agitation or resistance to it at the probable cost of the fall of the Ministry.86. It was in these circumstances that the Governor-General exercised the discretion vested in him by section 126 (5) of the Government of India Act and Instructed Governors to stand firm no matter what the consequences might be. The Premier of Bihar, on receiving the Governor&apos;s decision, passed orders on February 14th for the release of the remaining twenty-three prisoners forth-with . The Premier of the United Provinces passed no orders but made a de-mand for the release of all his prisoners, which was refused. On the even-ing of the 15th February both Ministries tendered their resignations ; these were not aecepred, pending arrangements to be made for the government of the Provinces. On the same day the Ministers left for Haripura, the venue of the open session of Congress.87. It is believed that the &quot;Working Committee did not expect or desire the resignation of the Ministries although they had authorised them to press the issue. Probably it Avas hoped that the Governors would either yield entirely or give sufficient concessions to the Ministries to enable the right wing to point at Haripura to this achievement in refutation of extremist criticism. Though the G overiior-General&apos;s action upset their plans, the resignations served the right wing&apos;s purpose well at Haripura : not only were the left shown that the Ministries could make the firmest stand for the principles of Congress, but the crisis so overshadowed everything else in importance at the session that the left had no opportunity of making their voices heard.The Governors of Bihar and the United Provinces issued communiques explaining their action ; and Gandhi made a non-committal statement on february-ary 16th, expressing the hope that the Governor-General would retrace his steps and so avert a crisis. For some days the possibility of all Congress Ministries being required to resign in sympathy was canvassed with interest throughout the country ; it is however known that no other Congress Ministry wished to resign.Up to February 22nd Congress leaders contented themselves with a resolu-fion and a spate of speeches condemning the &quot; unwarranted interference of the Governor-General &quot;, and the policy of the British Government in general. On the 22nd, the Governor-General issued a statement, firm yet conciliatory, explaining that Governors were still prepared to consider releases after exami-nation of individual cases, stressing the importance of the special responsibilities -ties, assuring Congress Ministries of the continued co-operation of Governors, and ending with the earnest hope that the Ministries would resume their tasks.This statement was received with relief^ and after Gandhi had made a second statement which helped towards a peaceful solution of the crisis, both the Ministries resumed work on February 26th, and joint statements were issued by the Governors and Premiers. While the Governors made it clear that their special responsibilities could not be encroached upon, the terms on which the Ministries returned were in the nature of a compromise ; a number of cases were immediately submitted to individual examination and orders passed for release. Each joint statement ended with the remark that &quot; there is no reason to fear that there will be any usurpation or interference with the legitimate functions of responsible Ministers &quot;. The Governor of Bihar agreed to the release of ten prisoners forthwith, while the Premier agreed to get an assurance of renunciation of violence from each one and guaranteed that there would be no demonstrations. The Governor of the United Pro-vinces agreed to the immediate release of six prisoners, who duly made a puh-lic statement that they had abjured violence.88. A crisis which for a few days seemed to have dangerous possibilities has in fact had salutary effects. The good relations of the two revolting Ministries with their Governors have not been impaired. While the impres-sion has been dispelled that the administration of Ministers is liable to wanton or capricious interference, it has been made clear that any attempt to thwart the safeguards in the Constitution will be checked. The Congress right wing gained ground at the expense of the extremists. It is worth mentioning that subsequent events have tended to confirm the apprehension that the lenient treatment of convicted terrorist prisoners was symptomatic of a general laxity &apos;in the attitude of Ministers towards the verdicts of the Courts. The criticism to which these Congress Ministries have exposed themselves as a consequence of this laxity is mentioned elsewhere (paras. 8 and 81).
89. The situation in the various Provinces since the crisis will now he described. There is nothing- to report about Assam, the Central Provinces, the North-West Frontier Province or Orissa.Bengal. Following the policy described above, the Governor agreed in March to the release of thirteen terrorists who had not been convicted for specifically violent crimes. Since November 1937 some twenty-five convicts have been released, seven of whom were ill and all of whom had served the greater part of their sentences.Since the beginning of March interest has centred round Gandhi&apos;s visit to Bengal, his ostensible purpose being to secure the early release of more &quot;political&quot; prisoners and detenus. He persuaded the local Congressmen to suspend agitation for releases during his visit, because he wanted a peace-ful atmosphere : he had two interviews with the Governor and several with the Home Minister : he also saw some prisoners in jail. Their attitude towards him shows diminishing respect and confidence in his powers to procure their ends. The Cabinet agreed that no commitment should be made to Gandhi without previous discussion, and he left Bengal on April 12th without having wrung any public promises from the Ministry. He has promised to return for further negotiations if necessary. The latest news is that the Dacca jail terrorists have threatened a new hunger-strike if their demands for release are not accepted.Bihar. Since the Ministerial crisis the Governor has agreed to the release of all the &quot; political &quot; prisoners except one. The Premier gave an assurance that they had renounced violence and there have been no reprehen-sible demonstrations. It is however reported that people living near the homes of released prisoners go in fear of victimisation as many of them gave evidence against the terrorists at their trials.Bombay. There were only three terrorist prisoners still in Bombay jails. The Ministry have shown a reasonable attitude. They did not take advantage of the crisis to press for release of the prisoners and although two of them (including Sadashiv Malkapurka, mentioned in the last survey) have been released, the Home Minister first satisfied himself that they had abjured violence, and obtained from them comprehensive assurances in writing to that effect.Madras. Government released the only two remaining &quot; political &quot; prisoners in the Presidency in February. One was a sick man and was re-ieased only after he had given an undertaking renouncing violence and promis-ing not to enter the Punjab (to which he belongs) during the remaining period of his sentence. Another Madras prisoner in jail in the United Provinces, who is mentally deranged, was released and handed over to a guardian. The Madras Ministry&apos;s solicitude for one of the Andamans terrorists (Sachidanandam) has had an amusing sequel. They gave the Government of India some trouble during- the Andamans hunger-strike by, pressing for his repatriation, and he was released at the end of the hunger-strike. He has since pestered the Premier, rejecting the jobs found for him and claiming as a patriot to be given Bs. 100 a month without duties. He has. now been prosecuted at the instance of the Premier, for besieging him in his office and residence, has gone on hunger-strike, and made his appearances in Court shouting revolutionary slogans on a stretcher. He has just been sentenced to one year&apos;s imprisonment, obstre-prosperous to the last. He may.prove more trouble to the Ministry &quot;as a prisoner than at large.Punjab. Barky in March seven non-violent prisoners were released, with a warning that any misbehaviour would lead to rearrest, and towards the end of April five terrorists were released.Sind. There was only one terrorist prisoner in Sind, Hans Eaj, a resident of the Punjab, whose scientific skill in .the furtherance of terrorism earned him the nickname of &quot; Wireless &quot;. He took an active part in two major conspiracies in the Punjab during 1929-30, but evaded arrest until 1932 when lie was caught in Sind and sentenced to an aggregate of 10 years imprison-ment. Allah Baksh, the new Premier of Sind who assumed office in March, soon raised the question of his release for which there had been a certain amount of agitation. Though his release will not cause any risk within the Province of Sind, &quot;his return to the Punjab would not be welcomed : but it is recognised that continued pressure from the -Ministry for his release could not be resisted. His case had not been decided at the end of April.
- Untied Provinces. Twelve of the fifteen prisoners were released within a month of the Ministerial crisis, and it is understood that the remaining three were to he released at the end of March.The present position therefore is that Bengal and the Punjab have still a considerable number of terrorist or revolutionary prisoners in jails. How far the released prisoners are showing signs of reverting to terrorist methods is a subject discussed in paragraph 99.(f) The Agrarian Situation,90. The land-revenue collection season in most of India covers the period under review. The state of collection ordinarily reflects agrarian conditions. Of great importance to the revenue collection is the prompt payment of rent by tenants to landlords, who are responsible for producing the revenue and naturally have difficulty in paying if then- rents have not come in. The latest information as to revenue collections in British India may be summarised as follows : In the non-Congress provinces collection of both revenue and rents is fairly satisfactory&apos;: revenue in Assam came in slowly and there was some no-rent &quot;agitation in Bengal at the end of March which has subsided. The Bengal Government have recently appointed a commission under the chairmanship of Sir Francis Flond to examine the land-revenue system.In certain Congress provinces there was at first considerable difficulty in realising land-revenue. The agrarian trouble in Bihar and the United Pro-vinces affected collections, but in the latter Province the Ministry&apos;s efforts to persuade tenants to pay their rents had its effect, and by March the collection of revenue and rents was reported to be satisfactory. The situation in the Central Provinces caused anxiety in January and February : Congress workers spread the news that Congress had pledged itself to reduction of revenue, and collections were disquietingly slow. The Ministry realised the disastrous effect that non-payment of revenue would have on the budget, and issued a circular to officers saying that Government would support coercive action if it was necessary. Collections have now greatly improved. In Madras the Agriculturists&apos; Belief Act was responsible for slowing down collections : one of its provisions deprives tenants of relief unless they pay up their rents for the past two years by September 1938. The natural result is that tenants are waiting till August to pay. Revenue collections however are now reported to be satisfactory. In the North-West Frontier Province the Ministry&apos;s in-decision over their intended remissions (mentioned in the last survey, para. 13) led the public to expect substantial relief mind the most valuable period of the year for revenue collection passed with practically no recoveries. The position has improved since the Ministry decided to grant remissions of approximately one lakh of rupees.91. The area where the agrarian situation is most disturbed is that where the big landlords are most to be found the U. P., Bihar, Orissa, and Bengal. The first three are Congress Provinces, with Ministries pledged both to improve the lot of the peasantry and to secure a greater contribution from the landlords by such measures as the taxation of agricultural income. Though both tendencies must command sympathy, the temptations to demagogism and a too rapid upheaval of the agrarian structure are strong. But generally it may be said that Congress Ministries are seeking to divest themselves of .the embarrassments inherited from their election promises. To pauperise the landlords is to alienate interests still powerful : and the appropriation by extremists of the grievances of the peasants has induced a reaction in the predominant section of the Congress.The importance of agrarian problems in a country where the vast majority of the population (and of the voters for election to the legislatures) is in some degree or other dependent on the land needs no emphasis. In fact it might almost be said that success in solving these problems will be the touchstone of provincial administration : its bearing on public order in particular has been brought out in the Provinces (e.g., the U. P. and Bihar) where the Tiisan (peasant) movement is active.In all the Provinces, the new Ministries face these problems on a some-what different footing from that of the old administrations. In some ways their position should give wider scope, in others it may be more difficult. The former because their hands are free of some   of   the   traditional shackles,ls38hd
For instance, in their dealings with the Permanent Settlement the old admmis-trations were, or considered themselves, narrowly restricted by pledges explicit and implicit : whereas the new Provincial Governments have power (subject to safeguards) to introduce changes. Again, circumstances, especially those of the disturbed years preceding the introduction of provincial autonomy, caused some local Governments to rely a good deal on the political support of the landlord class ; whereas the present Governments can claim a wider basis.Thus the new Governments may be expected to come to their task with some freedom from old restraints. On the other hand, they will still find grave difficulties in the way of any sweeping changes. Election promises to reduce land-revenue, water charges, and similar dues were in some Provinces lavish : but the Ministries have not taken long to find that the corner-stone of their financial edifice cannot safely be tampered with, and have gone little beyond the special concessions given for some years in most provinces on account of the slump in agricultural prices. That slump gravely increased the burden of agricultural debt : this is a problem which in recent years the old administra-tions have tackled in various ways in the different Provinces, but it is one for which there is no immediate or sovereign remedy, and it remains to be seen whether the somewhat drastic measures applied by some Ministries will get at the seat of the disease.92. The threat to public order comes from the movement among the peasants and agricultural labourers which had mostly fallen under the control of the Congress left wing. The Ministries deserve credit for meeting this threat with resolution : the policy of the Congress party towards the Msan organisations has been firm, and even repressive, and during the quarter dis-order has been only sporadic. In Bihar a serious disturbance occurred in the middle of February, when a party of tenants assaulted some zamindars diiring the harvesting of crops : three persons were killed and three seriously injured.In the United Provinces the campaign conducted.. by the Ministry to persuade tenants to pay rents was effective. During- the last two months the Ministry has been formulating an agrarian policy. Fifty thousand peasants marched to the Assembly to present their demands on March 1st, but dis-persed quietly when the Premier promised that legislation would soon remove their sufferings.   A similar demonstration was made on April 20th.93. Legislation. The Ministries of all the Congress Provinces, and of Bengal out of the non-Congress Provinces, have attempted legislation to improve agrarian conditions.The Bengal Tenancy Amendment Act which was passed in April has dis-pleased the landowners though it has more or less satisfied the tenants, Avho had not been led to expect any widespread relief in this Province. The Bill was at one time expected to endanger the stability of the Ministry, especially as it did not find approval with the European Group in the Assembly : they finally decided to remain neittral in order not to shake the&apos; foundations of a Ministry which Congress -was at the time making every effort to undermine.The Bihar Government early in January enacted the first Tenancy Amend-ment Act to give immediate relief to tenants, and had two more supplementary measures pending at the end of April. The Restoration of Bakasht Lands and Reduction of Arrears of Rent Bfil, which is designed to restore to tenants lands sold in execution of decrees during the period of low prices between 1929 and 1936, was referred to Select Committee in April. It also scales down arrears of rent and provides for their payment by easy instalments. The Bihar Agricultural Income-Tax Bill has been under discussion but had not been passed by the end of April. An unexpected obstacle the claim of Muslims that private as well as public Muslim religious endowments should be exempted  has at the moment not been surmounted.In Bombay there has been little agrarian agitation and the only measure passed is the Small Holders&apos; Relief Act, with its validity limited to one year, during which time proceedings for sale of land in recovery of agriculturists&apos; debts Avill be stayed on application bv small holders : the Bill also prevents eviction of tenants if they comply with certain conditions.The Central Provinces Government has passed three Bills during the last few months and a fourth the Relief of Indebtedness Bill has been cir-culated for opinion. A Reduction of Interest Bill was passed in March, affecting chiefly moneylenders&apos; transactions with agriculturists : at the same time the Revision of Land Revenue of Estates Bill was passed, removing certain concessions that Government had given to landowners and consequently increasing the provincial revenues : and execution of decrees passed against
agriculturists has been postponed for six months by a Bill recently passed, which also releases all agriculturists judgment-debtors who have been impri-soned in default of payment.The Madras Agriculturists&apos; Belief Act which has been in force since March 22nd is a controversial and complicated piece of legislation which has met with severe criticism and is believed to have created considerable opposition to the. Ministry. It includes provision for scaling down existing debts, reducing the rate of interest on future debts, and writing off arrears of rent.A similar Bill has been introduced in the North-West Frontier Province and has met with equal opposition from landowners. It follows the Madras Act in many of its provisions ; cancels all interest on debts outstanding on October 1st, 1937, reduces future interest and scales down existing debts. It was circulated for opinion in March.Legislation in Orissa includes the Orissa Tenancy Amendment Bill which was still pending at the end of April ; this Bill reduces interest on arrears of rent, by half and prohibits certain exactions by landlords as well as granting greater rights to tenants over holdings and trees. Amongst other measures are the Madras Estates Land (Orissa Amendment) Act which was passed in February and makes a serious reduction in landowners&apos; incomes. This was still under the consideration of the Governor at the end of April.Agriculturists in the United Provinces have long been expecting the Ministry&apos;s promised agrarian reforms. These were embodied in a Bill intro-dnced in the Assembly in April. The Leader of the Opposition raised an important point whether the previous sanction of the Governor had been obtained under section 299 (3) of the Government of India Act. This section requires such sanction for any measure which provides for the extinguishment or modification of rights in land : it had not till then been considered to cover tenancy legislation in any Province : and in the United Provinces the opinion of the Advocate General was that it did not apply. Nevertheless the Governor formally accorded his sanction. The Ministry anticipated opposition to the Bill and agreed to have it referred to Select Committee : this means postpone-ment of further consideration till July or August, by which time public opinion will have had time to express itself. The Bill contains 315 sections besides a number of schedules. Detailed description of it at this stage is unnecessary : it is sufficient to say that it comprehensively controls the rights of landlords in their dealings with tenants ; though not giving the kisans all they had been led to expect by election promises, its treatment of landlords is naturally regarded by that class as drastic. Another Bill -the United Provinces Debtors&apos; Relief Bill has been circulated for opinion.(g) Communism.94. The Congress party shows no disposition to lend itself to the spread of Communism by its supporters. In Congress provinces therefore those Com-munists who had reckoned on working through and under cover of the Congress find themselves temporarily at a disadvantage and are obliged to disguise their activities. Elsewhere, particularly in the Punjab and Bengal, Communists are freer to work in opposition to the Provincial Governments.In the middle of February Communists tried to arrange a &quot; hartal &quot; at Sholapur in the Bombay Presidency (where they had previously succeeded in creating disturbances) in connection with the agitation for the release of political &quot; prisoners. The result was a minor riot among millworkers from the criminal tribes settlement during the course of which all the local Communist leaders were arrested ; this coup is said to have given much satisfaction to the Home Minister.The Labour situation (which is discussed in paras. 95 98) has been comparatively quiet, though Communists are still to be reckoned with in Cawnpore when the present lull Is over. At the Haripura session of Congress. Communists were present in large numbers, distributing leaflets and attempting propaganda, but with little success. A recent agitation to persuade the Gov-ernment of India to lift the ban on the Communist Party of India aroused little sympathy.The Directorate of the Communist party of India has prepared a now declaration of policy, evidently influenced by Congress&apos; obvious hostility. The declaration explains that the Communists&apos; weakness has been their failure to function as a political party, and their policy must therefore be to co-operator
outwardly with Congress and take an active share in Congress activities. They propose to modify their critical attitude to Congress, while they will continue to agitate in order to force the pace. This policy was in evidence at the annual conference of the Congress-Socialists at Lahore which was attended by as many Communists as Socialists. A resolution was passed threatening a general strike and &quot; mass action &quot; to resist Federation ; but considerably more emphasis was given to the resolution according appreciation of the Congress Ministers&apos; work in fulfilment of their election pledges, and administering a warning against a tendency to constitutionalism. The Socialists carefully explained that they Avon Id not create difficulties deliberately for the Ministries but Avould serve as &quot; a corrective to the mistaken policies of the Congress &quot;. Discussion centred on the relationship betAA^een the Socialists and the Communists, and Avhether Com-munists should be allowed to join the Congress Socialist Party to form a united Left.Wing Avithin the Congress. No final decision appears to hnve been reached, and jealousies over leadership and fundamental group rivalries remain as keen as eA&apos;er and render infructuous all plans to effect left unity.(h) The Labour Situation.95. There has been no serious deA^development of the threat of grave labour trouble described in the last survey. In Bengal the threatened strike in the Electric Supply Corporation Avas averted Avhen the management and the work-ers entered into direct negotiations.Madras Presidency has had its own problem Avhich Avill be discussed below. There has been no trouble in any other ProAdnce except for occasional short-lived strikes.96. Bombay. The long-aAvaited report of the Textile Enquiry Committee Avas published on February 14th, recommending increases of wages to workers on a sliding scale. The Government accepted the recommendations, and all mill-owners ultimately agreed to follow them. The owners in Khandesh held out for some time and there was danger of a strike in all the mills in that area, but when the Government put pressure on the owners they reluctantly agreed to pay the Avages recommended. In return for accepting the Committee^ re-commendations, mill-owners have extracted from the Government various con-cessions including a promise that further legislation providing for sickness bene-nts and old-age pensions for workers shall be postponed for at least one year.The prospects of serious labour trouble in Bombay have thus faded away. Workers are said to be realising that their strikes did them little good and have lost faith in Communists. The Goa ernment noAv intend to consolidate the posi-tion by introducing a Trade Disputes Bill Avhich Avill make the strike weapon illegal until methods of arbitration have been tried : if the Bill goes through it will be another bloAv to Communist hopes.97. Madras. About the beginning of the year, Avorkers in the British-owned Harvey&apos;s mill at Papanasam struck as a result of a Avages dispute, and the men in Harvey&apos;s mill at Madura came out in sympathy. A lock-out was declared and the dispute lingered on Avithout causing much excitement. The GoArernment tried to bring about a settlement but the management refused to submit to arbitration ; at the beginning of April the management announced their intention of reopening the Madura mill forthwith. The local officials ap-prehended serious rioting and Government asked the management not to open the mills, pending a settlement of the dispute ; this they agreed to do and the dispute Avas referred to arbitration.In the middle of April, the management decided to leave the Papanasam mill closed pending the result of arbitration, but to open the Madura mill and to refuse to take back some 2000 of the men employed previously. Anticipat-ing rioting and disorder, the Government demanded that the management should agree to the return of all Avorkers as a condition precedent to the open-ing of the mill. When the management refused, the Government instructed the local police to apply to the magistrate for an order under section 144, Criminal Procedure Code, to prevent the&quot; management from opening the mill on the ground that it Avould result in picketing and serious disorder. This order Avas issued. Fortunately the management then agreed both to refer the dispute to arbitration, and to reinstate all the Avorkers preAdously employed, whereupon the restraint order Avas AvithdraAvn. Some twelve thousand Avorkers Avere in-volved in the dispute.It is said that Harvey&apos;s mills have not enjoyed a good reputation in labour matters.
(i) Terrorism,99. Tt is not yet possible to judge whether released terrorist prisoners are reverting to their old habits, but there are disquieting reports from some pro-vitiees (Bengal in particular) and some daring crimes committed recently sug-gest that the possibility of a recrudescence of terrorism cannot be overlooked.A railway dacoity near PIpiidlh in the United Provinces is strongly remi-niscent of the notorious Kakori train dacoity : a party of young men said to have been between the ages of 20 and 30, held up a train and robbed the mail van, having first warned passengers that they intended to take Government property only. Tn the middle of April the Law Member designate of the Govern-ment of India was robbed of some Rs. 400 worth of property while travelling in a train in Bihar. In Gaya (Bihar) two men held up a motor-car&apos;at the point of revolvers, and ordered the driver to drive on until they evaded pursuit among the hills. When they were located by police, they are said to have asserted that it was only Europeans whom they wanted to kill ; they opened fire on the police, and, after wounding one officer, made off ; one of them was captured later ; both belong to the town of Gorakhpur in the United Provinces, and the absconder Is a railway fitter who is suspected of complicity in the Pipridih dacoity.(j) Communal Troubles.100. The quarter has seen serious communal disturbances in various places, and it is to be feared that communal tension is increasing-. The revived activity of the Muslim League was expected to produce this result, and Avithout doubt some part of the blame must be aAvarded to the crude communalism of much of Its propaganda. On the other hand the League accuses the arrogance of Con-gress, fostering by &quot; mass contact &quot; contempt for any opinions but its oavii and using its political dominance to benefit Hindus at the expense of others. The occasional utterances of Hindu Mahasabha leaders haA^e not diminished irritation-1s38hdIt is interesting to find the -Ministry in Madras employing in a novel manner a provision of laAV which Congress has professed to regard with disapproval,-Moreover, the Ministry do not appear to have been entirely guiltless of impos-bug on the local magistracy their views as to the necessity for the use of the-provision. This again is worthy of remark in view of the traditional argument for the separation of executive and judicial functions that the judicial deer-si on to be formed by a magistrate under the section is liable to be dictated by higher authority.98. United Provinces. No open trouble has broken out although the situation has been potentially dangerous. The Cawnpore Labour Enquiry Committee had been sitting for some months, and workers showed signs of rest-lessness at the delay in the issue of the report. In March a memorandum sub-mitted to the Government referred to their indefinite labour policy and said that workers wore getting desperate. Demonstrations in Cawnpore were held almost daily to demand early publication of the report. Communists were busy urg-ing workers to be prepared for a general strike in the event of unfavourable re-commendations being made.The report, was completed about the end of March. The Premier adopted the device of showing an advance copy confidentially to both parties in the dis-pute. The Inevitable leakage of information aroused suspicions that the Ministry had influenced the Enquiry Committee to produce proposals which were approximately what the Ministry desired.; The main recommendations are as iollows : an Increase in wages for all workers arranged on a sliding scale, with a minimum wage of Rs. 15 per month, to apply &quot;to both cotton and woollen indus-ries : the establishment of a labour exchange : a uniform set of rules for all mills : annual leave with pay for workers -: 60 holidays in the year including Sun-days : the recognition by employers of the Mazdur Sabha : and the establish-ment of a regular labour office for the collection and publication of Information regarding labour conditions and welfare. Whether these recommendations will be accepted remains to be seen. Cawnpore Communists are looking forward to a general strike if the employers reject them. A recent report states that 3000 woollen-mill workers in Cawnpore have gone on strike over a dispute about pay-snent of bonuses.
The- Congress Working Committee has naturally been perturbed by events -which not only weaken the claim of Congress to represent the nation but also, cause great inconvenience and worry to Congress Ministries : and Gandhi, with his usual candour, has pointed to the disorders as proving that Congress is still unable to govern by its own non-violent principles, seeing that only force has availed to check the riots. In addition to Hindu-Muslim disturbances there are two other communal problems, the Shahidganj dispute in the Punjab and the Madh-e-Sahaba dispute in the United ProAdnces which will be considered sepa-rately.101. In the Punjab a Hindu-Muslim riot occurred at Hissax on February 11th, the day of the Muslim festival of Bakr-Id, resulting in three deaths and a number of injuries. Strained relations continued and on March 26th a second, riot broke out in the same town in Avhich five Hindus Avere killed.The simultaneous observance of the great Muslim festival of Moharram and the important Hindu festival of Holi in the middle of March led to tension in many districts in the Punjab, the United Provinces and the Central Provinces^ Elaborate precautions Avere taken to preventive^ent clashes, but did not prevent grave disorders in the United Provinces and minor riots in the Punjab. Ample wam-ing of trouble to come in Allahabad was given by the attitude of the Muslim community, who threatened to abandon their celebrations as a protest against Hindus playing music on the main roads during the festiA^al ; troops patrolled the city and a restrictiA&quot;e order Avas Issued. The authorities brought about a settlement and anxiety temporarily subsided. Restrictive orders were issued in numerous danger-spots in the United Piwinces in order to prevent a breach of the peace. March 13th, the great day of the Moharram, passed off peace-fully except for minor clashes in various districts of the Punjab and the United Provinces. Towards the end of the observance of these two festiA^als the strain increased and from March 17th to 20th there was serious rioting in Allahabad and Benares ; nineteen persons Avere killed and OA^er 100 injured. Police had to open tire in Allahabad and European troops patrolled both cities. Curfew and other restrictiA^e orders Avere issued and the situation Avas brought under control. The United Provinces Go\&apos;ernment encouraged district officers to take ail possible steps to maintain order. In Lahore a disturbance on March 17th Avas responsible for tAvo deaths and forty injuries. In Jubbulpore (Central Pro-vinces)--the scene of trouble in November tension Avas acute and riots and stray assaults accounted for four deaths and a number of injuries : troops paraded the city, a curfeAV order Avas issued, and the police had instructions to fire on anybody seen attacking persons or property. These measures aA^erted any extensive disturbance. In the United Provinces Assembly Muslim members of the Assembly made an unworthy attempt to exploit the troubles that had occurred in order to discredit the Ministry. In the Punjab Assembly the Minis-try now refuse to answer questions which are liable to encourage communal ill-feeling.Bombay Avas the scene of reckless disorder on April 17th. A brawl between a few Hindus and Muslims who were playing cards started a rumour of a com-munal disturbance. Within a short time rioting broke out, trams and buses Avere held up, and assaults took place. Twice the police had to open fire on the mob : they caused no fatal injuries. Troops stood by, a curfew and other restrictive orders were issued, and 2,400 arrest were made. Three Ministers visited the affected area to prevent panic. Fourteen persons were killed and about 90 injured including one Avoman who Avas stabbed by a Muslim.102. Shahidganj (Lahore). The earlier history of the Shaliidgamj dispute was described in the last survey (para. 53). Although violence has been avert-ed, the stability of the Ministry was for a time threatened by developments arising from the judgment of the High Court in the ciAdl suit for possession of the mosque, giA^en in favour of the Sikhs. The Ahrars&apos; civil disobedience move-merit, which started in December, continued up to the end of April Avhen it was abandoned after the decision of the Muslim League in Calcutta, discussed bcloAv. Volunteers from the North-West Frontier ProA-ince,. the United Pro-vinc.es and Delhi joined the agitators in Lahore, and altogether oA^er a thousand persons were arrested.At the end of January the Council of the Muslim League, to whom Muslims were looking for guidance, held a meeting in Delhi to consider their attitude. Jiiinah is said to haA-e handled the meeting Avith dexterity. He opposed civil disobedience, and. argued in favour of localising the issue. A resolution was passed to summon a special session of the League to decide the line of action, to be taken, though no date or place was fixed.
At the end of February a new development arose. One Malik Barkat Ali, a Muslim League member with a grudge against the Premier, gave notice of a Bill to apply Muslim law to all buildings which had ever been mosques, with retrospective &quot;effect. The result of such a Bill becoming law would have been to over-ride the judicial decision, to nullify certain provisions of the Limitation &apos; Act, and to entitle Muslims to possession of the Shahidganj mosque as well as any other building that had ever been a mosque. The Premier, depressed by support to this Bill given by a number of his followers, talked for a while of resignation : but on March 7th he took courage and informed his Muslim sup-porters that the Ministry proposed to advise the Governor to withhold sanction to the Bill. The Governor, acting in his discretion under a provision of the Government of India Act which &quot;imposes that safeguard on legislation aiming at the extinguishment or modification of rights in land, refused sanction to the introduction of the Bilk On March 16th in the Assembly the Premier stated that though the Governor had acted in his discretion, he had consulted the Ministry owing to the great importance of the issue involved ; and defended the advice tendered by the Ministry. In a wise and impressive speech he des-cribed the alarming effect which the Bill would have had on the relations between communities, and claimed for himself and his colleagues the support of the House.This statement was well received both in the Punjab and outside : nineteen of the twenty-four members who had supported the Bill promptly withdrew their support, the Ministry were never in danger of defeat, and the opposition were discomfited. The Muslim League Council on March 20th passed a resolution approving the Premier&apos;s action, and decided to-hold the special Shahidgunj session at Calcutta on April 18th.The special session confirmed the action of the Punjab Premier, over-ruling the extreme communalists. It further asserted that the League is &quot; willing and ready to render all the assistance and help they can towards a solution of the matter &quot;. Thus the immediate danger has been averted. The civil disobedience programme has been suspended : and it remains now to be seen whether a settle-nient can be arranged. The obstacles are recognised as considerable, since no compromise can emerge except through willingness on the part of the Sikhs to give up some part of their legal lights : and each of the rival leaders of the Sikhs hesitates to make a move which might prejudice his influence with a com-munity which bigotry can always rouse to passion. On April 27th, a petition (on behalf of the Muslims) for leave to appeal to the Privy Council against the High Court decision came up for hearing before a Full Bench, which issued notice to the other side and an ad interim order for the maintenance of the status quo. If leave is granted, it is possible that both the agitation and any attempt to find a lasting solution will remain in abeyance till the case is decided.103. The Madii-&apos;. Sahaba dispute (Luchnoiv). -This controversy arose some thirty years ago between the two sects of Muslims, Shias and Sunnis. The basis of the dispute is a conflict of beliefs about the successors of the Prophet in the Caliphate. Shias regard the first three successors to Muhammad as usurpers, and consider them largely responsible for the division of Islam into two rival parties which resulted in the massacre of Alps son, Husain, and most of his family at Karbala. Sunnis on the other hand believe in the valid election of the first three Prophet&apos;s successors ; and though they deplore the massacre at Karbala do not treat it as of the highest significance. Shias commemorate Husain&apos;s death on three special days of the year, Moharram, Chhelum and Ramzan ; on these days they carry round tazias, representations of Husain&apos;s tomb, as memorials, ultimately taking them to a burying ground. Sunnis are forbidden the outward expression of grief and the carrying of tazias, which they regard as idolatrous, though many Sunnis disobey this precept.The trouble at Lucknow began in 1905, and Sunnis began to recite in public verses in praise of the first four Caliphs known as Madh-e-Sahaba, that is &quot; praises of the companions of the Prophet &quot;. Following on riots in 1907 and 3908, a committee appointed to investigate the parties&apos; claims recommended that there should be a general prohibition of the recitation of Madh-e-Sahaba on the three great days of mourning, though recitations on other days should be left to the operation of the ordinary law, which meant that the verses could lie publicly recited on other days after a license had been obtained under the provisions of the Police Act. The local Government accepted this recommendation in a resolution of January 1909. There was some excitement in 1909, but no further trouble occurred till 1935. - -
In 1935 two Sunnis courted arrest by disobeying the order, and in 193$ during Moharram two more followed suit. On Chhelum- 1936 fourteen persons disobeyed tho order and the agitation was in full swing. Sunnis then went a step-, further and decided to recite Madh-e-Sahaba every Friday ; this was forbidden by the Lueknow officials who had all offenders arrested. Finally, when all attempts to settle the dispute had failed, a committee was appointed to examine whether the resolution of 1909 required modification, and whether the practice of the Liicknow authorities required modification.The committee, under the presidency of a European High Court Judge, reported in June 1937, but the report was published only on March 28th, 1938-along with the resolution of the Government of the United Provinces accepting the findings. The committee decided that no modification was required at alL and its finding more or less maintains the stains quo i.e. Sunnis have a right to recite the verses at suitable times, but not to the annoyance of the public nor in a manner provocative to Shias. The dispute is therefore left in much the: same condition as it was.Further trouble has recently broken out. It appears that the Sunnis of Lucknow claimed an unrestricted right to recite the Madh-e-Sahaba, and so the-District Magistrate issued an order prohibiting the recital on April 22nd, the day of the Chhelum festival. Measures were taken to prevent disorder, but while the Shia procession was passing through a Sunni quarter, Sunnis started throwing stones : this incident quickly developed into a riot in the course of which ten persons were killed and about one hundred and sixty injured. The police had to open fire and all the usual measures were taken to restore order. No one was killed by the police firing.This dispute is likely to add to the worries of a Ministry sufficiently occu-pied with the threats to public order in the labour position at Cawnpore and the Hindu-Muslim trouble in various parts of the Province.Since the events described in this part, the United Provinces Government has decided to take severe steps to combat communalism. Securities have been demanded from newspapers ; an editor has been prosecuted for making- a dangerous communal speech ; and instructions have been issued to local authori-ties that court notices should not be sent for ptiblication to newspapers which are responsible for communal bitterness.VI.-POLITICAL MOVEMENTS:(a) The Congress Party.101. The annual session of the All-India Congress was held at the village of Haripura in Bombay Presidency from February 19th to the 21st. The country side is chosen for this purpose in deference to Gandhi&apos;s rural tastes : but in fact the session requires a vast camp. The expenditure of R.s. 7-1 lakhs at Haripura on accommodation for the leaders and rank and file, and the installation of modern conveniences, was rather acidly criticised by Gandhi. Of the success of the session as a spectacle and entertainment there can be no doubt the number of visitors was estimated at 1,20,000. Of its party success opinions will vary according to political leanings : but the gain to the prestige of Congress as a whole and the leaders in particular cannot be questioned. The more important resolutions passed at the session will be found in the Appendix.Sublias Bose, who assumed the Presidency of the Congress at the session, made an unfavourable impression. His presidential speech combined prolixity with poor delivery, and was an exposition of his own ideas rather than of the official and more moderate policy. Since the session the new President&apos;s stock has fallen even lower : he has disappointed the left wing, and is little regarded by the right : his gift for leadership or even co-operation with leaders has pi&apos;removed slight : and he seems to be relapsing to the status of a mere provincial faction-monger.The right wing has still further consolidated its position in the struggle against the left which was referred to in the last survey. The elections of dele-gates to the Haripura session indicated clearly which way the wind was blowing.; and the manoeuvres which ended in the Ministerial resignations completed the dis-eomfiture of the left-wing. The right, had an easy oassage for their resolutions, all of which clearly reflected their influence and which included yet another con-deronation of Jcisan activities.
There is information that the right-wing is not content with its victories hut Intends to strengthen its position by the issue of new rules which will not permit members or.&apos; the All-India Congress Committee to remain on the executive of non-Congress organisations such as the Socialist Party, Kisan Sabhas and the like. Nor will members be permitted to criticise openly the Working Committee &apos;s deci-sions. These rules, which have not yet been made public, have created consterna-tion among the extremists.105. Attitude to Federation. Of the interest taken by Congress in the Federal scheme there can be no doubt : it might be described as a topic of daily discussion. It is less easy to estimate the real attitude of leading Congressmen towards it. Perhaps it is Incorrect, or premature, to speak as if the various elements had crystallised into a definite policy. The official dictum on the sub-ject is contained in the Resolution passed at Haripura in February. . The full text will be found in the Appendix. Paragraphs 1 and 3 of this contain a posi-tive rejection of the scheme and a warning that every measure possible will be taken to prevent its introduction. If this were all, the attitude of Congress would be unambiguous. The last sentence of paragraph 1 and paragraph 2, however, state acceptance of the principle of Federation and at the same time indicate the obnoxious elements of the scheme offered by the new Constitution  namely, (i) the lack of full responsibility at the Centre, and (ii) the failure to require representative institutions and responsible government in the States. This passage has been widely interpreted as indicating that the Congress, even without a drastic amendment of the Constitution Act, would consent to the Federal Scheme provided these two objections were substantially met ; and there is reason to believe that the more parliamentary-minded leaders would assent to this interpretation. The extreme unlikelihood of the British Parliament, preoccupied as it is with grave. matters. and sated with Indian affairs, considering in the near future a sweeping revision of Part II of the Act, is generally recognised. The mention in the resolution of a Constituent Assembly as the only possible agency for the framing of an acceptable constitution repeats the doctrine specially dear to Jawaharlal Nehru ; but it is noticeable that mention of a Constituent Assembly is not to be found in some of the resolutions passed recently (though before the Haripura session) in Congress Provincial Assemblies. The Madras text, for instance, passed at the instance of Baja-gopalacharl in January, substituted for the Constituent Assembly &quot; the respon-sible provincial Governments and national leaders &quot;.But for Gandhi &apos;s influence, a forecast might be hazarded that the history of provincial autonomy would be repeated in the history of Federation that is, that the Congress would on certain terms consent to work the scheme as it stands relying, perhaps, on Ministers being informally brought into policy on the reserved subjects, and on the more important Indian States proceeding by stages towards a measure of democracy. But Gandhi&apos;s influence is still pre-dominant : his mind is his own, singularly unaffected by the opinions of others and working in a manner which baffles analysis. It is certain that while he. retains his powers he will decide the Congress policy : his doubt of the fitness of Congress for a renewed fight with Government all along the line is real, and proceeds not so much from question of the completeness of the organisation as from a fea r that non-violence will not be strictly observed and from his pessimism about the communal situation ; but he feels a personal responsibility for &quot; wreck-ing &quot; the Act, and it would be unsafe to forecast that he will consent to any policy which could be accepted by Parliament.106. Attitude to Minorities. The communal situation is known to be causing the Working Committee great anxiety. At Haripura Congress declared afresh (see Appendix) that it &quot; regards it as its primary duty and fundamentalpolicy to protect the..............rights of the minorities in India &quot;, but thereIs no evidence that such protestations carry conviction : and enough has been said elsewhere to show that Muslims at any rate are more rather than less hostile to the Congress.107. Attitude to &quot; Untouchables &quot;. The Congress party made the removal of untouchability one of the chief items of its programme as long ago as 1920, and now that Congress Governments are administering seven orovinces they have the opportunity to translate their theories into practice. They have been given a lead by certain Indian States (Travancore and Indore) which have ordered all State-aided temples to be thrown open to &quot; untouchables &quot;. So far the only Congress Ministry to take action has been Bombay. The legislature there has passed a Bill which permits trustees of temnles to throw them open to&apos;&quot; Harijans &quot;. This has been reserved for the consideration of the Governor General on the ground of its repugnancy to existing Indian law (in particular ls38hd
the law governing religions trusts is affected). The.Madras Government were criticised in February for failing to carry out their election pledge to secure temple-entry for &quot; Harijans &quot;, and a private Bill has since been introduced, which permits of Hindu temples being thrown open by their trustees to Harijans if a majority of Hindu voters on the electoral roll of any local body decide that this should be done.In the TJ. P. a large number of members of the scheduled castes marched to see the Premier on April 4th, to remind him of his promises.108. Attitude to States. Mention was made in the last survey (paragraph 89) of the resolution passed at the All-India Congress Committee meeting at Calcutta in November, suggesting that Congress should take a more active part within the territories of Indian States, against the established policy of the party and in direct opposition to Gandhi &apos;s convictions. It is understood that the extremists continued to press for further Interference in the States, but the long-winded resolution passed at Haripura (see Appendix) goes back on the Calcutta resolution and represents a victory for Gandhi&apos;s policy : it admits that &quot; under existing circumstances &quot; the Congress cannot work effectively within the States for the attainment of democratic freedom : and requires that for the present Congress Committees in States shall function under the direction and control of the Working Committee and are not to engage in &quot;parliamentary activity &quot; or &quot; direct action in the name or under the auspices of the Congress &quot;,The Calcutta resolution was prompted by events in Mysore State : and it is significant that the latter part of April has seen bitter hostilities between that Darbar and local Congressmen. These came to a head on the 25th, when illegal demonstrations at a place called Viduraswatham led to firing.by the police. The official figures of the casualties are 10 dead and 8 injured, but unofficial reports put the number of killed as high as 36. Nineteen police officers received injuries. These activities of Congress are in disobedience to the published policy, and are being conducted in a State considered to be more advanced on the road to demo-democracy than most, and in which a &quot;Constitution Committee &quot; has been set up to consider further reforms. In the circumstances it might have been expected that Gandhi, if not the Working Committee, would have emphatically disowned them. Gandhi, however, in a statement issued on April 29th, questions the apologia of the Mysore Government, expresses pleasure at the &quot; popular awakening &quot; in the State-and the hope that it equally gladdens the State authorities ! He ends With counsel to the Maharaja and Diwan to &quot;divest the Government of its autocracy and make popular representatives responsible for the administration in Mysore &quot;.109. Attitude to Indians overseas. Among the Haripura resolutions were no fewer than four dealing with the affairs of Indians overseas (see Appendix). One of these relates to the cloves controversy in Zanzibar. The boycott in India of cloves imported from Zanzibar continues, with a good deal of pressure on the merchants engaged in the trade. In Bombay picketers have been arrested for obstructing coolies handling the imports : but the inclination of the merchants is to make their peace with Congress rather than enlist the aid of the law.110. Gandhi with improved, though still precarious, health has dominated Congress during the quarter. On April 15th, he was granted a second interview by the Viceroy. His meetings with the Governor and the Home Minister of Bengal have been mentioned elsewhere. He regards the improvement of com-munal relations as one of his most important tasks, but confessed to deep depres-sion before engaging in the negotiations with Jinnah mentioned below.111. Jawaharlal Nehru with the demission of the Presidentship of the Congress seems to have receded into the background : and it remains to be seen whether a personality which appears. subdued and chastened will resume leadership in Indian affairs. He proposes to visit Europe in June, and may there attempt to turn into practical channels the fraternal feelings professed between Congress and its extremist admirers in England.(b) The Muslim League.112. The League continues, and is likely to remain, the only all-India organi-sation which can challenge the supremacy of the Congress. It is difficult to esti-mate the growth of its influence, but that it is growing seems certain ; and Jinnah &apos;g position as its leader is strong within the League and respected outside it. The League has been criticised as not touching the masses, but in a community like that of Islam where brotherhood within the community is more than a phrase it is probable that its influence goes beyond the professed politicians and this view is
certainly supported by the increasing assertiveness of Muslims which has led to disorder in various places. The disturbances at Jubbulpore may be quoted, and a riot in Cawnpore on February 6th, where a procession in honour of a Muslim Congress Minister was broken up. In electoral contests the League continued to. hold its own, and more, against the Congress. At Saugor in the Central Pro-vinces the League candidate easily defeated his Congress rival. Where, as in the N.-W. F. P., the League is ranged against a Muslim Ministry, it shows to less advantage and plays the communal role more blatantly.in the Punjab the Muslim members of the Unionist party have now joined the &quot;League. In the Central Assembly Jinnah&apos;s new League party may prove a re-re-inforcement to its, and his, importance. His reception at Calcutta where he opened the special session of the League in April was impressive.There is no diminution in the professed hostility of the League towards Congress : but negotiations are in progress the effect of which remains to be seen. Jinnah and Nehru have been in correspondence : it is an open secret that Jinnah has therein put up his price for rapprochement with the Congress. Now Gandhi himself has taken a hand. On April 28th, he and Jinnah were closeted at Bombay for three hours. All that has been published about the discussion is that certain concrete propositions have emerged, and that these will be further pursued between Jinnah and Subhas Bose, the Congress President.113. The League&apos;s attitude towards the Shahidganj dispute, decided at the Calcutta conference of April 17th-18th, is dealt with elsewhere (paragraph 102). The other resolutions&quot;passed thereat were directed against the Congress, condemn^ ing the Congress Ministries for failing to protect Muslim minorities during com-munal riots, congratulating the Ministries of Assam and Bengal on resisting the efforts of Congress, to displace them, and calling on Muslims to combat the anti-?duslim activities of the N.-W. F. P. Ministry.On matters of wider scope the League has little to say. Its attitude towards &quot;Federation has not been further clarified since the declaration of October last which recorded its &quot; emphatic disapproval &quot; of the Federal scheme embodied in the Constitution Act while favouring the establishment in India of full inde-pendence in the form of federation of free democratic states in which the rights and interests of Mussalmans and other minorities are equally and effectively safe-guarded &quot;.The distrust of the Federal scheme is based on the fear that it will enable Congress to dominate the Centre and so interfere even with the non-Congress Provinces. ...(c) Other Opposition to Congress.114. The Hindu Mahasabha,. Attempts are being made to revive the influence of the Hindu Mahasabha, a party which has a purely communal outlook and whose slogan is &quot; India for the Hindus &quot;. Its President is V. D. Savarkar, who was sentenced to transportation for life for abetting a terrorist outrage in 1909. His views are not only anti-British but rabidly anti-Muslim. The party objects to the refusal of Congress to recognise a purely communal organisation, and views with great disapproval any attempts to bring about an agreement with Muslims. Sarvarkar has announced his intention of re-organising the Mahasabha and in order to revive interest in it has been touring the country, especially the Central and the United Provinces, maldng violently communal speeches, and provoking Muslim feeling.Bhai Parmanand, a member of the Central Assembly, and a Mahasabha leader of a milder tvrje, states the difference between his party and the Congress in other terms : the Mahasabha believes that Federation should be accepted as the only means by which India can achieve unity, and Parmanand invites the Congress frankly to accept the label affixed to it by the Muslim League as a purely Hindu, organisation, and to work as such. The Mahasabha does not agree with the Congress anti-militarist views : it desires that Hindus shall fit themselves to hold their own bv force of arms. As an organisation, the Mahasabha cannot claim great weight though it has in places proved its competence at the popular pastime of communal strife.115. Other Muslim organisations. The Ittihad-i-Millat was originally founded bv Maulana Zafar Ali Khan to carry on agitation for the restoration of the Shahidgani mosque to the Muslims, and to discredit the pro-Congress Ahrars who at first kept aloof from the agitation. Since the Maulana has ioined the Muslim League the organisation&apos;s sympathies are now oro-Jinnah. The recent Shahidganj agitation apparently brought the Ittihad-i-Millat and the Ahrars
together, but the reasons for the alliance seem to be purely political : the Ahrars were out to embarrass the Ministry and the Ittihad-i-Millat wished to force the Premier to come to terms with Jinnah. When the Premier and Jinnah came to an agreement, the Ittihad-i-Millat were doubtless anxious to abandon their agita-tion ; the Ahrars also felt that it was serving no useful purpose, but each side was waiting for the other to make the first move in order to avoid losing; influence with the populace. Both factions have taken part in the civil disobedience cam-paign at Lahore. The Ahrars have now discontinued it, but it remains to be seen whether the Ittihad-i-Millat will follow suit.The Ahrars&apos; sympathies are generally pro-Congress ; the Ittihad-i-Millat is in favour of the Muslim League. The Punjab has also another Muslim sect known as Qadianis, generally regarded as heretical : they are notably hostile to the Ahrars. The &quot; Bed Shirts &quot; in the North-West Frontier Province are a purely Congress organisation.VII-.-SPECIAL PROBLEMS.(a) Palestine.116. Nothing is now heard of the agitation against the partition proposals but for occasional expressions of indignation in the press and speeches by minor Muslim politicians. Nor has anything more been heard of the activities of the &quot; Palestine Council of Action &quot; mentioned in the last survey ; little interest was shown in the resolution (see Appendix) passed at the open session of the All-India Congress in. February, which again protested against the continuation of the reign of terror which is still being maintained in Palestine &quot; and expressed the full sympathy of Congress with the Arabs in their &quot;struggle for national freedom and their fight against British Imperialism The resolution again condemned the idea of partition and suggested that the proper method of solving the Arab-Jew problem was by an amicable mutual settle-ment. The Muslim League passed no resolution on this subject at the Calcutta Conference in April. It must not be assumed however that any steps taken towards implementing the policy of partition would not lead to a revival of agita-tlon in India.(b) &quot; Prohibition &quot;.117. The movement towards &quot; prohibition &quot; has now reached at any rate the stage of examination in every Province, and the measure has already been introduced in most Provinces.Madras is the pioneer Province in this movement, and the measure is parti-cularly dear to the heart of the Premier. It is at present in force only in, and immediately round, his own district of Salem though he contemplates an early extension to one or two other districts. The introduction of the restriction has naturally been followed by a crop of prosecutions : but the Collector^ review of progress Is considered to be ground for a belief that the measure can be success-fully enforced and that the people can be weaned from the desire for. alcoholic liquor. It must, however, be remembered that a campaign for total abstinence, like other forms of evangelical aetivitj&apos;&apos;, is apt to produce immediate successes which are not maintained. The previous experiment In the same district of a. few years ago had this history, and ended in failure : though the Premier can be trusted to see that effort is sustained, and not confined to mere prevention of access to drink, some degree of scepticism as to the ultimate results is justified.The Central Provinces Prohibition Bill was passed only on March 10th, and it is too early to estimate results.The Assam Government do not seem to have got beyond the stage of delibera-tion.&apos; la Bengal one district, Noakhali, &quot; went- dry &quot; from April 1st, but the Finance Minister asserted in the Legislative Assembly that &quot; prohibition&quot; is not a pressing problem in Bengal, and that the experiment would be extended if it succeeded but would be abandoned altogether if it failed.In Bihar a Prohibition Bill, modelled on the Madras measure, was passed only on April.26th : but&quot; the district of Saran, to which its provisions are first to applv, has beemunder restriction for some weeks, as all &quot; country &quot; liquor and drug shops have been closed.   One effect of &quot; prohibition &quot; is to throw&quot; out: of
employment people whose hereditary profession is the tapping- of trees and manufacture of liquor and who cannot at once fit themselves for other occupa-tions even if such can be found. The immediate problem in Bihar, besides the enforcement of the new restrictions, appears to be to provide for a large num-ber of such persons.In Bombay &quot; prohibition &quot; has begun in Ahmednagar district and will shortly be introduced in the industrial city of Ahmcdabad and the surrounding area. Somewhat significantly, the Bombay Government have indented for a large number of firearms with which to arm their preventive force : and the pre-cautionary measures taken seem to indicate the expectation of considerable eva-sion, if not resistance.In the N.-W. F. P. the Hera Ismail Khan district has gone &quot; dry &quot; from April1st.The Orissa budget includes provision for the prohibition of opium in Balasore district at a loss of one lakh of rupees.The Punjab Government are approaching the question cautiously : the Re-venue Minister has announced that complete prohibition &quot; would involve a loss of .1.16 lakhs of revenue, but that the Government are considering an experiment in one district.Though the original Sind Ministry had taken no steps in this direction, the new Premier intends to surrender the revenue from the sale of the drug&apos;&apos; charas &apos; but only if he can find an equivalent source of revenue to take its place.In the United Provinces total &quot; prohibition &quot; was introduced in two districts, Etah and Mainpuri, on April 1st. The Ministry have announced a bold four-year programme for the introduction of complete &quot; prohibition &quot; in the province.(c) Gujarat Lands.118. This problem is still proving intractable. The attitude of Morarji Djesai, the Revenue Minister, has become more unreasonable, and recent developments show that his determination to wrest the forfeited lands from their present lawful owners by fair means or foul has become translated into a personal feud against Mr. Garrett, the Commissioner, whom he believes to stand between him and his object.In March the Commissioner recommended that as a means of arriving at a settlement by negotiation those owners who had not hitherto come to a voluntary agreement with the Congress should be offered as a fair price twenty-five limes the assessment of their lands ; Desai refused to accept this proposal, asserting that eight times the assessment was a fair price. This gulf has not been bridged.The Ministry have not abandoned the idea of expropriation by legislation. Munshi, the Home Minister, has put forward tentative proposals. There is already a Land Acquisition Act in force in India to enable Government to acquire land compulsorily if it is required for public purposes : MunshFs pro-posals differ from the Act in two important particulars-the compensation to be paid for acquisition is to be 10 per cent, above the adjudged market value instead of 15 per cent, as in the Act : and the award of the Tribunal to be appointed to adjudge the amount of compensation is to be final, Avhereas under the Act provision is made for appeal to the Courts. The proposal for a Special Tribunal with absolute powers warrants the suspicion that market value is not to be settled on-the well-established principles of the Land Acquisition Act.The Premier, too scrupulous to satisfy his more vehement colleagues, is yet reluctant t o -repress attempts to upset an arrangement which was accepted with great reluctance by Gandhi in 1931 and which Vallabhai Patel has not ceased to denounce.Munshi &apos;s active interest in the scheme is probably in some measure due to a willingness to embarrass the Premier, into whose shoes he is willing to step. The Governor had hopes that the Ministry would be prepared to let private negotiations run their course, and that eventually the problem would thus be reduced to inconsiderable proportions : but this solution appears unlikely. Unless the Ministry are prepared to raise their offer to a price which tho present owners can be induced to accept without illegal pressure, the only step now open to them is to acquire the lands by legislation of a character which the Governor will be able to accept as not inconsistent with the pledge of 1930.Meanwhile, the personal campaign against Mr. Garrett came to a head when the Ministers became aware of his designation as officiating Governor of Sind. Oosai thereupon pressed the Premier to demand his immediate transfer tows38hd
another post, The Premier was reluctant to support such an outrageous&apos; request : and had it been made it would have been refused. It was not made, as. not even Vallabhai Patel was willing to force 3 deadlock on so weak a ground. The Premier, however, in conveying this decision to the Governor, complained that Mr. Garretfs promotion to the Governorship was a humiliation to the Ministers and had diminished their &quot; joy &quot; in working the constitution.(d) The Congress flag and &quot; Bande Mataram &apos; \119. Although nag-hoisting ceremonies are periodically performed, the Congress Party &apos;s demand that the charka tricolour shall be recognised as the national flag of India has noticeably weakened; For one thing the flag-waving-fashion spread to the Socialists and Communists and the Congress leaders found it necessary to prohibit any exhibition of the Red Flag (still more the Soviet hammer and sickle) as a substitute for, or a rival of, the Congress emblem. The main reason for a more modest attitude towards the latter, however, is the hardening of Muslim feeling and the counter-exhibition of the star-and-crescent emblem of the Muslim League. The Union Jack has not been dis-placed as the flag of India : and the action of two Congress members of the Central A ssembly, who removed the flag flying over the Assembly sector of the Council House, may be dismissed as a sign of end-of-session exuberance, work-ing on natural bad manners.120. The claims on behalf of &quot; Bande Mataram &quot;have similarly diminished. No more has been heard of the committee appointed by the Working- Committee, to examine cm-rent national songs with a view to finding- a substitute for it : but the excision of the stanzas offensive to Muslims has not made it unlversally aeeeptable. Muslim (and some Indian Christian) members of the Madras Assembly regularly walked out of the House as a protest against the singing of the song during the session in January : and on the opening day of the Budget session in March the Premier asked the Speaker to suspend the&apos; singing of the song- (at the daily prayers) until a unanimous understanding had been reached. The Speaker complied ,- and this surrender may be regarded as typical of the diminishing claim of the Congress to assert a right to represent India which is challenged with increasing force.y (e) Anti-war and anti-recruiting propaganda.121. At the open session of the All-India Congress In February, the party (see Appendix) stated afresh &quot; the policy of the Indian people in regard to foreign relations and war &quot;. The resolution expressed a desire for world peace and claimed that a free India will stand for disarmament and collective security, but recognised that world co-operation is Impossible so long as Inrperialism and the exploitation of one people by another continue. It asserted that British foreign policy by supporting Fascist powers is largely responsible for the &quot; progressive deterioration in the world situation &quot; ; that India cannot permit her man-power and resources to be exploited in the Interests of British Imperialism ; the Congress therefore entirely disapproves of war preparations in India, large scale manoeuvres, and air-raid precautions, &quot; by which it has been sought to spread an atmosphere of approaching war in India &quot;.Although this is the official verdict of Congress, it is doubtful&apos;whether it represents the convictions of the saner elements in the party. For instance. Vallabhai Patel is known to have remarked in conversation at Bombay that, if Britain became involved in a war, Congress would certainly not contemplate a civil disobedience movement ; that they had no Avish to lose British protection or to jeopardise Britain&apos;s chances against the dictators, but would offer their support. Current events in Europe and in Asia are more likely to enhance the desire of Indian politicians to fit Indians for a greater share in their own defence than to encourage mere pacifism.Another resolution passed at the open session condemned Japan&apos;s brutal Imperialism in China, and as a mark of India&apos;s sympathy called upon the people of India to refrain from purchasing Japanese goods. But no serious attempt has been made to organise a boycott.Anti-recruiting propaganda continues, especially in the Punjab and the United Provinces, but the effect continues to be slight. Direct interference with recruiting parties has not been reported. The emergency legislation enacted at the Centre in 1932 to combat the civil disobedience movement included a section
itesigned to punish, the -offence of dissuasion from enlistment : in 1935 this section was repealed as it had proved a dead letter and there does not yet appear to be -sufficient reason to re-enact it.(f) Language in Legislatures.152. The first of these surveys (paragraph 14) drew attention to the problem of the use of the vernacular in provincial legislative bodies.   The provisions of&apos; section 85 of the Government of India Act, 1935, have now been criticised by most of the new legislatures and have been the subject of conflicting rulings by presiding officers.   The objection (not confined to Congress Provinces) is that too strict a restriction is imposed on the use of the vernaculars : though in part this is based on a nationalist prejudice against the use of English, there is also n genuine feeling that the terms of the section hamper the business of the legis-Legislatures where English is not familiar to a large number of the members.   An&apos; amendment of the section has been suggested by the Government of India to permit greater use of the vernacular while retaining English as the statutorily&apos; recognised  language   in which   proceedings   should    be    conducted.   The Secretary of State appreciates the grounds for objecting to a provision which : there are no means of enforcing and which is being openly evaded : at the same time he is doubtful whether it is politic to reverse the decision  contained   in section 85 and to permit the conduct of debates on a bi-lingual or even multi- &apos; lingual basis, even though it may be argued that the obligation to conduct pro-ceedings in English is unworkable and unjustifiable.   He has, therefore, asked for a fuller expression of the views of the Government of India and particularly of the Governors of provinces.   The views of Governors are being obtained.VIII.-THE CENTRAL LEGISLATURES.(a) The Central Assembly.123. General. The Budget session lasted from January 31st, to April 12th, The Congress party gained three members, and so numbered 47 in a house of -188. The Independents (Jinnah&apos;s party), numbering 15, still held the balance between Government and the Opposition ; and, when Jinnah was present to lead them, on several occasions turned the scales against Congress. The session was quiet, apart from the explosion on the Budget (described below) : and Government ment had little difficulty In getting their way on most of the official business. Congress have never made up the weight lost when some of their most useful men left the Assembly for Provincial politics : and the absence through illness during most of this session of Satyamurti, who is their Deputy Leader and their most adroit, most industrious and best-informed debater, was a serious handicap. The main cause, however, of the diminishing obstructiveness of Congress is probably the existence of the Congress Provincial Ministries and the experience gained in those Provinces of the methods of administration. The Government of India can no longer be blamed for everything that happens : and it is difficult to represent as particular vices of that Government methods which every administration must employ.Even the constitutional crisis in the TJ. P. and Bihar, and the Budget developments, did not really Impair the tone of the House, and business went forward much more expeditiously than was expected. The Budget affair did, however, emphasise the contrast between the constitutional position at the Centre and that in the Provinces.Henceforward Jinnah will lead a Muslim League party in the Assembly. The composition of this will not he known till the next session begins, but it will probably contain almost all the present Independent party and some Democrats and unattached Muslims.For the first time in its history the Assembly contains a woman member (Mrs. Subbarayan). She took her seat late in the session, having been elected in a casual vacancy on the Congress ticket. Her husband is one of the Madras Ministers.The prolongation of the Assembly&apos;s life by the Governor-General for one year more did not create much surprise. Had this not been done, the comment would have been that Federation must still &apos;be distant,
124. Legislation. Government earned popular approval by giving; a favouring wind to two non-official Bills amending the Child Marriage Restraint Act (a highly controversial measure when it was passed in 1930), The main objects of these Bills were to strengthen the Act by (a) preventing evasion of it by resort to Indian States and foreign territory in India, and (&amp;) enabling a magistrate to prevent a child-marriage by the issue of an injunction. The Assembly was overwhelmingly in favour of the Bills : orthodox Muhammadans reiterated formal protest against legislation affecting religious practice ; and the voice of die-hard Hinduism, though voluble, was solitary and despair-ing.Important Government measures occupied the Assembly. The voluminous Insurance Bill was finally passed. So was a Bill to amend the Trade Disputes Act of 1929. The Act had seldom been used, and the Bill has improved it by widening the interpretation of the term &quot; trade dispute &quot; and by providing more effective conciliation machinery. A comprehensive Motor Vehicles Bill was; referred to Select Committee. The Income Tax Bill, introduced towards the end of the session, is based on the report of an expert Inquiry Committee. The Congress Party is at a disadvantage in taking up its ground on this Bill : the element which has affinities with &quot; big business &quot; does not see eye to eye with the more democratic elements, and tenderness for assessees is difficult to square with the desire to find enhanced revenue for the Provinces. A move for dilatory tactics was circumvented : the Bill will be circulated by executive order forthwith, examined by a Select Committee in October, and brought before a special session of the Assembly in November.125. Budgets. The Railway budget had an easy passage. The revised estimates for 1937-38, presented on February 14th, forecast a surplus of about Rs. 2$ crores against the original estimate of 15 lakhs : and the estimated surplus for 1938-39 is about Rs. 2i crores. This prosperous position gave little scope for criticism, and the general discussion and the discussion on various-token cuts went little outside the well-worn tracks. (Had the budget come up later, the. atmosphere would have been less calm : for the publication, towards the end of the session, of Sir John Thom&apos;s report on the grave railway disaster at Bihta strongly criticised the administration. An attempt to discuss it on an adjournment motion was met with a promise to allot time for a regular debate in the Simla session : and meanwhile the Railway Member was vigorously bombarded in the question hour.)The General budget was presented on February 26th. The Opposition was not to be impressed by the achievement of meeting the cost of the introduction of provincial autonomy, of the Niemeyer Award, and of the military operations in Waziristan without the imposition of new taxation. A departure from pre-vious practice in the preparation of the budget papers was discovered and manu-factured into a grievance which led all the organised parties except the elected European Group to refuse participation in the general discussion or in the discussion of demands for grants and of the Finance Bill. The excuse for this unprecedented demonstration, and for the total rejection of the Budget, was the exclusion from the &quot; voted &quot; part of the Budget of the provision for the pay of civilian clerks in the Defence Department. Under the new Government of India Act this had to be classified as &quot; non-voted &quot; along with other Defence expenditure. It was none the less open to the Opposition to censure the Defence policy of Government by moving a cut on the votable demand relating to the Executive Council who may reasonably be regarded as more responsible for that policy than are the Secretariat clerks. This fact was ignored in the desire to demonstrate the supposed highhandedness of the Finance Member and the helplessness of the House. The nett result was a &quot; certain liveliness &quot; (vehement but not ill-humoured), expedition of business, and the passing of the demands and the Bill by the inevitable machinery of the Governor-General &apos;s special poAvers.126. Other Business. The respectiA&apos;e powers &quot;of the GoA&apos;ernor-General and the President were freely exercised in thAvarting by disalloAvance attempts to occupy the House with questions, adjournment motions, and resolutions beyond its scope. The GoArernor-General&apos;s exercise of his powers met Avith a certain amount of criticism in the Congress Press.Among the adjournment motions disalloAved by the President was one to discuss the Ministerial crisis-occasioned by the Governor-General&apos;s interven-tion in the release of political prisoners. The Governor-General refused per-mission to a number of motions and resolutions including a resolution for the appointment of a committee to examine defence expenditure, another which
stated that it is not in the best interests of India to take part in any war in which Great Britain may he in volved, and an adjournment motion to discuss the restora-tipn of certain areas which have been under the administration of the Central Government to the States of Udaipur and Jodhpur (to which States the areas belong).Considerable interest was shown in military affairs. The session opened with an adjournment motion to discuss the &quot; mechanisation of the British portion of the Indian Army &quot; which was talked out after good-humoured discus-sion. A number of questions were asked about the possibility of expanding the Air Force and improving India&apos;s air defences.A resolution that the Central Assembly should be consulted before the conclusion of any trade agreement with the United Kingdom was carried in spite of Government &apos;s opposition ; and Government suffered another defeat at the end of the session when a resolution was passed to appoint a retrenchment committee to consider central expenditure in the hope of reducing it by ten per cent. -(b) The Council of State.127. The budget session, lasting from February 15tli to April 9th, was chiefly remarkable for conflict between the Opposition and the benevolent autocracy of the Chair. The budget dispute in the Assembly had its reactions in the Council : the two Opposition parties walked out of the House before the general discussion on the budget began. Later, the same parties, provided the unusual spectacle of a game of hide and seek, Avhen consideration of the Finance Bill, certified by the Governor-General, was moved. They walked out in protest, but when the motion was put one member returned and challenged a division. On the Presi-president&apos;s refusing a division, all the Opposition trooped in to question his ruling. Confusion reigned for some time and the House had to be adjourned, until apologies were offered and the division was allowed and carried.The House adopted the amendments made by the Assembly to the Insur-ance Bill, which will: now become law. The Trade Disputes Bill, as passed by the Assembly, went through with only one amendment ; and the Child Marriage Restraint Bills secured an easy passage.Observing that, out of the ninety questions on the first day&apos;s list of business, fifty-seven came from one member and twenty-seven from another, the President warned the House that unless members exercised restraint he would be com-pelled to limit the number of each member&apos;s questions. (In the Assembly a member may now ask only five questions a day). Later in the session&quot;&apos;&apos;the &quot;President had to give a ruling about the extent and scope of supplementary questions. The President also gave a severe warning to the press against publication of notices and resolutions before they were finally admitted.Here, as in the Assembly, much interest was shown in military affairs. A resolution that full military training should be given to all physically fit Indians between 21 and 30, and that they should be admitted to permanent units of the Army, was rejected after the Commander-in-Chief had indicated the imprao-practicability of such a colossal conscript army. Another resolution to increase the number of cadets in the Dehra Dun Military Academy was also defeated : so were also revolutions for the provision of more adequate sea and air defence at the expense of the army, and for the appointment of a committee to examine the possibilities of reducing defence expenditure ; and a resolution recommending the formation of a national army in India, recruited from all classes.Interest was aroused by a resolution asking for legislation in Parliament to make it competent for the Indian Legislature to subject to income-tax the interest on sterling loans and salaries and pensions paid out of the revenues of India. The resolution was defeated by the unusually narrow margin of three votes.ls38hd
APPENDIX,The main resolutions passed by the 51st session of the Indian National Congress, at Haripura, on February 19th-21st, 1938.1. Indians Overseas.This Congress views with alarm the rapidly growing deterioration in the status, posi-tion and rights enjoyed by the Indians in South and Bast Africa including Kenya, Uganda, Tanganyika, Zanzibar and also in the islands of Mauritius and Fiji.This Congress condemns the new economic policy now being pursued by British Imperialism for intensifying its exploitation of the Colonies and Dependencies which is exemplified in the formation of the monopolist Clove-Growers&apos; Association in Zanzibar and in such measures as the Tanganyika Native Produce Bill, Bast Africa Transport Pro-jects, the reservations of the highlands in Kenya for the white population and the degrad-ing treatment of Indians in Mauritius and Fiji.This Congress whole-heartedly associates itself with the struggles of overseas Indians to maintain even their present position and status in the territories in which they have settled.This Congress assures its fellow countrymen overseas of its full sympathy and help and expresses its readiness to take all actions within its powers to ameliorate their condi-tion.This Congress further wishes to assure the original inhabitants of South and East Africa that the demand of the Indian settlers is not conceived in any spirit of hostility towards them but is put forward to prevent the common exploitation of both the Africans and the Indian settlers by British Imperialism.Moved from the GJwir. .2. Indians in Zanzibar.The Congress expresses its appreciation of the response of the Indian people to the appeal made on behalf of the Congress to refrain from the use of cloves, and that the boy-cott of trade in cloves in Zanzibar by the Indian merchants has been complete and satjs-faetory. The Congress congratulates the Indians in Zanzibar and the Clove merchants in India on the manner in which they maintained this boycott.The Congress however regrets that the question of the rights of Indians in Zanzibar for internal and export trade has not yet been satisfactorily solved. The Congress repeats its request to the Indian people to continue the disuse of cloves and presses upon the atten-tion of the merchants the desirability of continuing the boycott of trade in cloves and trusts that by these measures the Zanzibar Government would be compelled in the near future to do justice to the Indian traders in Zanzibar by rescinding the objectionable decrees.Moved from the Chair.&quot; 3. Indians nsr Ceylon.The Congress is deeply concerned over the threatened estrangement of feelings between the people of Ceylon and the Indian population in the island consequent on certain legisla-tion in regard to local administration, and apprehensions as to discriminatory measures that may be further undertaken. The Congress urges on the Government of Ceylon and her public men not to adopt any policy directly or indirectly aimed at discrimination as against the Indians living-and carrying on their avocations in Ceylon. In particular, the Congress notes with regret that laws have been recently framed so as to deny the Indian labourers, who have helped and are helping in the development of the resources of the island, the franchise in the local administration, and to make the Indian residents appre-hend further restrictions on their civil rights and to feel that they are to be relegated to an inferior political status. The Congress hopes that such measures will not be undertaken and that any legislation that has created such a feeling will be so modified as to make India feel that, in spite of being separate Governments, Ceylon and India are one and inseparable so far as the people are concerned.Moved from the Chair.4. China.The Congress has viewed with anxious concern the aggression of a brutal Imperialism in China and the horrors and frightfulness that have accompanied it. In the opinion of the Congress this imperialist invasion is fraught with the gravest consequences for the future of world peace and of freedom in Asia. The Congress sends its deepest sympathy to the people of China in their great ordeal and expresses its admiration for the heroic
struggle they are conducting to maintain their freedom and integrity. It congratulates them on achieving national unity and co-ordination in tfhe face of danger, and assures them of the solidarity of the Indian people with them in the common task of combating Imperial-ism and achieving freedom.As a mark of India&apos;s sympathy with the Chinese people, the Congress calls upon the people of India to refrain from purchasing Japanese goods.Moved from the Chair.5. Palestine.The Congress condemns the decision of Great Britain as a mandatory power to bring about the partition of Palestine in the teeth of the opposition of the Arabs and the appoint-merit of a Commission to carry out this project.The Congress records its emphatic protest against the continuation of the reign of terror which is still being maintained in Palestine to force this policy upon the unwilling Arabs.The Congress expresses its full sympathy with the Arabs in their struggle for national freedom and their fight against British Imperialism.The Congress holds that the proper method of solving the problem by which the Jews and Arabs are faced in Palestine is by amicable settlement between themselves and appeals to the Jews not to seek the shelter of the British Mandatory and not to allow themselves tlo be exploited in the interests of British Imperialism.Moved from the Chair.6. Foreign Policy and &quot;War Danger.In view of the grave danger of widespread and devastating war which overshadows the world, the Congress desires to state afresh the policy of the Indian people in regard to foreign relations and. war.The people of India desire to live in peace and friendship with their neighbours and with all other countries, and for this purpose wish to remove all causes of conflict between them. Striving for their own freedom and independence as a nation, they desire to respect the feeling- of others, and to build up their strength on the basis of international eo-opera-tion and goodwill. Such co-operation must be founded on a world order and a free India will gladly associate itself with such an order, and stand for disarmament and collective security. But world co-operation is impossible of achievement so long as the roots of international conflict remained and one nation dominates over another and Imperialism holds sway. In order, therefore, to establish world peace on an enduring basis, Imperial-ism and the exploitation of one people by another must end.During the past few years there has been a rapid and deplorable deterioration in Inter-national relations. Fascist aggression has increased and an unabashed defiance of Inter-national obligations has become the avowed policy of Fascist Powers.&quot; British foreign policy in spite of its evasions and indecisions, has consistently supported the Fascist Powers in Germany, Spain, and the Far Bast and must therefore largely shoulder the responsibility for the progressive deterioration of the world situation. That policy still seeks an arrange-ment with Nazi Germany and has developed closer relations with rebel Spain. It is helping in the drift to Imperialist World War.India can be no party to such an Imperialist war.and will not permit her man-power and resources to he exploited in the interests of British Imperialism. Nor can India join any war without the express consent of her people. The Congress, therefore, entirely dis-approves of war preparations being made in India and large scale manoeuvres and air-raid precautions by which it has been sought to spread an atmosphere of approaching war in India. In the event of an attempt being made to involve India in a war, this will be resisted.Moved by Pandit Jaivaharlal Nehru.   Seconded by Acharya Kriplani.7. Excluded Areas and Commissioners&apos; Provinces.A. This Congress re-affirms its ppinion that the creation of excluded and partially excluded areas and ChieE Commissioners&apos; Provinces, including British Baluchistan and Coorg tinder 1he provisions of the Government of India Act of 1935 obstructs the growth of uniform democratic institutions in integral parts of India covering an area of over 207,900 square miles and inhabited by over 13 million people.This Congress condemns this step as one of the attempts to divide the people of India into different &quot;groups for unjustifiable and discriminatory treatment repressing their liberties and obstructing their progress.
This Congress further re-iterates the opinion that the separation of these excluded and partially excluded areas undoubtedly adms at leaving a larger control of disposition :and exploitation of the mineral and forest wealth in those areas in the hands of the British Government.Thi-i Congress declares that the same level of democratic and self-governing institiu-tions should be applicable to all parts of India without any distinction.15. This Congress supports the demands of the inhabitants of the Chief Commissioners&apos; Provinces of A jiuer-Merwara and Coorg that their provinces may be amalgamated with the United Provinces, and with Karnatak in the Province of Bombay respectively.C. This Congress condemns the reactionary and irresponsible administration of the Province of Delhi attended with suppression of civil liberties and burdened with high taxes and extremely heavy land revenue and other similar measures adopted by the Delhi Administration.Moved from ike Chair.8. Ajmer-Merwara Amy the Indian States.The Congress has heard with great resentment of the separation of about 115 villages from Ajmer-Merwara- Province and now,, placed under a temporary administration pre-paratory to these tillages being surrendered partly to Jodhpur and partly to TJdaipur States.The Congress condemns this action of the British Government taken in the teeth of the direct opposition of the people of this area.Moved from the Chair. ,,9. Federation.The Congress has rejected the new Constitution and declared that! a Constitution for India, which can bo accepted by the people, must be based on Independence and can only be framed by the people themselves by means of a Constituent Assembly, without inter-ference by any foreign authority. Adhering to this policy of rejection, the Congress has, Siowever, permitted the formation in provinces of Congress Ministries with a view to strengthen the nation in its struggle for Independence. In regard to the proposed Federa-tion, no such considerations apply even provisionally or for a period, and the imposition of this Federation will do grave injury to India and tighten the bonds which hold her in subjection to Imperialist domination. This scheme of Federation excludes from the sphere of responsibility vital functions of Government.The Congress is not opposed to the idea of Federation but a real Federation must, even apart from the question of responsibility, consist of free units enjoying more or less the same measure of freedom and civil liberty, and representation by the democratic process of election. The Indian States participating in the Federation should approximate to the Provinces in the establishment of representative institutions and responsible Government, Civil Liberties and method of Election to the Federal Houses. Otherwise the Federation as it is now contemplated, will, instead of building up Indian unity, encourage separatist tendencies and involve the States in internal and external conflicts.The Congress, therefore, re-iterates its condemnation of the proposed Federal Scheme and calls upon the Provincial and Local Congress Committee and the people generally, as well as the Provincial Governments and Ministers, to prevent its inauguration. In the event of an attempt being made to impose it, despite the declared will of the people, such an attempt must be combated in every way. and the Provincial Government and Ministries ipust refuse to co-operate with it. In case such a contingency arises, the All-India Congress Committee is authorised and directed to determine trie line of action to be pursued in this regard.Moved by Govind B. Pant.   Seconded by Bhulabhai J. Desai.10. Kenya.The Congress is of opinion that the administrative practice of excluding British Indians from acquiring the lands in the Highlands of Ken^ya Colony while a European of any nationality is free to do so constitutes a humiliating disability to the Indians settled in Kenya and is a deliberate offence to the Indian people.This Congress further condemns the proposal to promulgate an Order in Council defining the boundaries of the white highlands which is calculated to perpetuate statutorily the erstwhile iniquitous practice which should have been abolished long ago in accordance with the declarations of the Government of India at the time of the issue of the White Paper of 1923. the pledge given by the Government of India to get the subject re-opened still remains and will become totally incapable of being carried out in the event of the proposed Order in Council being passed.Moved from the Chair. ls38hd
11. National Education.The Congress 1ms emphasized the importance of national education ever since 1906 and during&apos; the non-co-operation period many national educational institutions \vere started under its auspices. The Congress attaches the utmost importance to a proper organisation of mass education and holds that all national progress ultimately depends on the method and content and objective of the ediication that is provided for the people. The existing system of education in India is admitted to have failed. Its objective has been anti-national anil anti-social, its methods have been antiquated, and it has been confined to a small number of people and has left the vast majority of our people illiterate. It is essential therefore to build up national education on a new foundation and on a nation-wide scale As the Congress is having new opportunities of service and of influencing and controlling  State education, it is, necessary to lay down the basic principles which should guide such education and to take other necessary steps to give effect to them. The Con-gress is of opinion that for the primary and secondary stages a basic education should be imparted in accordance with the following principles :*-y1. Free and compulsory education, should be provided for seven years on a nation-wide pcale.2. The medium of instruction must be the mother tongue.3. Throughput this period education should centre round some form of manual and productive work, and all other activities to be developed or training to be given should as far as possible be integrally related to the central handicraft chosen with due regard to the environment of the child,Accordingly the Congress is of opinion that an All-India Education Board to deal with this basic part of education be established and for this purpose requests and authorises Dr. Zakir Hussain and fcjhri E. Aryanayakam to take immediate steps under the advice and guidance of Gandhiji, to bring such a Board into existence in order to work out in a consolidated manner a programme of basic national education and to recommend it far acceptance to those who are in control of State or private education,The said Board shall have power to frame its own Constitution, to raise funds and perform all such acts as may be. necessary for the fulfilment of its objects.Moved by Pitrxhotlamdas Tandon,   Seconded by Prafulla Chandra Ghosh,12. Minority Rights.The Congress welcomes the growth of anti-imperialist feeling among the Muslims and other minorities in India and the growing unity of all classes and communities in India in the struggle for India&apos;s independence which is essentially one and indivisible and can only be carried on effectively on a united national basis. In particular the Congress welcomes the large numbers of members of the minority communities who have joined the Congress during the past year and given their mass support to the strug-gle for freedom and the ending of the exploitation of India&apos;s masses.The Congress approves of and confirms the resolution of the Working Committee on Minority Rights passed in Calcutta in October 1987, and declares afresh that it regards it as its primary duty and fundamental policy to protect the religious, lingulatic, cultural and other rights of the minorities in India so as to ensure for them in any scheme of Gov-ernment to which the Congress is a party, the widest sdope for their development and their participation in the fullest measure in the political, economic and cultural life of the nation.Moved by Pandit j. Ifehru.   Seconded by BasiJflal Bishyqs.33. Indian States.In view of the fact that owing to the growth of public life and the demand for free-dom in the Indian States, new problems are arising and new conflicts are taking place, the Congress lays down afresh its policy in regard to the States.The Congress stands for the same political.- social and economic freedom in the States as in the rest of India and considers.the States as integral parts: of India which cannot be separated. The Purna Swaraj or complete Independence, which is the objee-tive of the Congress is for the whole of India, inclusive of the States, for the integrity and unity of India must be maintained in freedom as it. has been maintained in smbjee-tion. The only kind of federation that can be acceptable to the Congress is one in which the States participate as free units, enjoying the same measure of democratic freedom as the rest of India. The Congress, therefore, stands for full responsible Government and the guarantee of civil liberty in the States, and deplores the present backward condi-tions and utter lack of freedom and suppression of civil liberties in many of those States.
The Congress considers it its right and privilege to work for the attainment of this objective in the States. But, under existing circumstances, the Congress is not in a position to work effectively to this end within the States, arid numerous limitations and restrictions imposed by the Rulers or by British authority working through them hamper its activities. The hope and assurance which its name and great prestige raise in the minds of the people of the States find no immediate fulfilment and disillusion results. It is not in consonance with the dignity of the Congress to have local committees which cannot function effectively or to tolerate indignity to&apos; the National Flag. The inability of the Congress to give protection or effective help, when hopes have been raised, produces helplessness in the people of the States and hinders the development of the movement for freedom.In view of the different conditions prevailing in the States and the rest of India, the general policy of the Congress is often unsuited to, the States and may result in pre-venting or hampering the natural growth of a freedom movement in a State. Such move-men rs are likely to develop more rapidly and to have a broader basis, if they draw their strength from the people of the State, produce self-reliance in them, and are in tune with the conditions prevailing there, and do not rely on extraneous help and assistance or on the prestige of the Congress name. The Congress welcomes such movements but in the nature of things and under present conditions, the burden of carrying on the struggle for freedom must fall on the people of the States. The Congress will always extend its goodwill and sup-port of such struggles carried on in a peaceful and legitimate manner, but that organisational help will inevitably be, under existing conditions, moral support and sympathy. individual -dual Congressmen however will be free to render further assistance in their personal capacities. In this way the struggle can develop without committing the Congress organi-sation and thus unhindered by external considerations.The Congress therefore directs that, for the present, Congress Committees in the States shall function under the direction and control of the Congress Working Committee and shall not engage in Parliamentary activity nor launch on direct action in the name and under the auspices of the Congress. Internal struggles of the people of the Stales must not be undertaken in the name of the Congress. For this purpose independent orga-nisations should be started and continued where they exist already within the States.The Congress desires to assure the people of the States of its solidarity with them and of its active and vigilant interest in and sympathy with their movement for freedom. It trusts that the day of their deliverance is not far distant.Moved by Jairamdas Daulatrcm.Seconded by A&quot;. V. Gadgil, V. J. Patel and Dr. Pattabhai Sittaramayya.14. Ministerial Resignations in United Provinces and Bihar.In accordance with the directions of the Faizpur Congress, the All-India Congress Committee decided in March 1937, the issue of acceptance of offiee in provinces and per-mitted Congressmen to form Ministries, provided certain assurances were given by or on behalf of the British Government. These assurances not being forthcoming, the leaders of Congress Parties in the Provincial Assemblies declined at first to form Ministries. Thereafter there was a considerable argument for some months regarding these assurances and various declarations were made by the Secretary of State for India, the Viceroy and Governors of the Provinces. In these declarations it was definitely stated, among other things, that there would be no interference with the day to day administration of Provin-cial affairs by responsible Ministers.The experience of office by Congress Ministers in the Provinces has shown that at least in two Provinces, the United Provinces and Bihar, there has in fact been inter-ference in the day to day administration of Provincial affairs as shown hereafter. The Governors, when they invited Congress members to form Ministries knew that the Congress Manifesto had mentioned the release of political prisoners as one of the major items of the Congress policy. In pursuance thereof the Ministers began the release of political prisoners and they soon experienced delay, which was sometimes vexatious, before the Governors would endorse the orders of release. The way releases have been repeatedly delayed Is evidence of exemplary patience of Ministers. In the opinion of the Congress, release of prisoners is a matter coming essentially within the purview of day to day administration, which does not admit of protracted discussion with Gover-nors. The function of the Governor is to guide and advise Ministers, and not to inter-fere with the free exercise of their judgment in the discharge of their day to day duty. It was only when the time came for the Working Committee to give an annual account to the Congress delegates and to the masses of people backing them, that the Committee had to instruct Ministers, who were themselves sure of their ground, to order release of the political prisoners ip their clurrge and to resign if their orders were countermanded.
The Congress&apos; approves of and endorses the action taken by the Ministers of the United Provinces ami Bihar and congratulates them on it.In the opinion of the Congress, the interference of the Governor-General with the deliberate action of the respective Prime. Ministers is not merely a violation of the assurance above referred to, but it is also a misapplication of Section 126 (5) of the Government of India Act. There was no question of grave menace to peace and tranquillity involved. The Prime Ministers, had besides in both eases satisfied themselves from assurances from the prisoners concerned and otherwise of their change of mentality and acceptance of the Congress policy of non-violence. Indeed it is the Governor-General &apos;s interference which has undoubtedly created a situation that may easily, in spite of the Congress effort to the contrary, become such a grave menace.The Congress has, during the short period that Congressmen have held office, given sufficient evidence of their self-sacrifice, administrative capacity and constructive ability&apos; in the matter of enacting legislation for the amelioration of economic and social evils. The Congress gladly admits that a measure of co-operation was extended by the Governors to the Ministers. It has been the sincere effort on the part of the Congress to extract what is possible from the Act for the public good and to strengthen the people in the pursuit of iheir goal of complete independence and the ending of Imperialistic exploita-tioh of the masses of India.The Congress does not desire to precipitate a crisis which may involve non-violent non-co-operation and direct action consistent to the Congress policy of truth and non-violence. The Congress is therefore at present reluctant to instruct Ministers in other provinces to send in their resignations by way of protest against the Governor-Genera) &apos;s action,, and invites His Excellency the Governor-General to reconsider his decision so that the Governors may act constitutionally and accept the advice of their Ministers in the matter of the release of the political prisoners.The Congress regards the formation of irresponsible Ministries as a way of dis-guising the naked rule of the sword. The formation of such Ministries is calculated to rouse extreme bitterness, internal quarrels and further deepen the resentment against the British Government. When the Congress approved of its acceptance of office with great reluctance and considerable hesitation, it had no misgivings about its own estimate of the real nature of the Government of India Act. The latest action of the Governor-General justifies that estimate and not only exposes utter inadequacy of the Act to bring real liberty to the people, but also shows the intention of the British Government to use and interpret it not for the expansion of liberty but. for its restriction. Whatever, there fore, may be the ultimate result of the present crisis, the people of India should realise that there can be no true freedom for the country so long as this Act is not ended and a new Constitution, framed by a Constituent Assembly, elected on the basis of adult fran-franchise, takes its place, the aim of all Congressmen, whether in office or out of office, in Legislatures or out of Legislatures, can only be to reach that goal even though it may mean as it often must mean, sacrifice of many a present advantage, however beneficial and worthy it might be for the time being.On behalf of the United Provinces Governor, it has been stated that the demonstra-tions organised to welcome&apos; the Kakori prisoners and the speeches delivered by some of them had interfered with the policy of gradual release of political prisoners. The Congress has always discouraged unseemly demonstrations and other objectionable activities. The demonstrations and speeches referred to by the U. P. Governor were strongly disapproved by Mahatma Gandhi ; Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, President of the Congress, had similarly taken immediate notice of the indiscipline which was thus betrayed. Nor were they ignored by the Ministers. As a result of these corrective steps public opinion rapidly changed and even the persons concerned came to realise their mistake. And when six prisoners, one of whom was a prominent member of the Kakori group, were released subsequently, about two months after the release of Kakori prisoners, no demonstrations were held in their honour. Nor any reception waa accorded to them. Nearly four more months have since elapsed and any delay in releasing the remaining 15 prisoners only on account of the demonstrations or the speeches connected with the prisoners who were released in August, is&apos; now utterly unjustified. The respoti-sibility of the maintenance of Law and Order is that of the Ministers and they are entitled to perform their functions in such a manner as they deem proper. It is their business to weigh all relevant factors in the light of prevailing circumstances, but their decisions oace taken ought to be accepted and enforced. Any interference with them in the exercise of their powers in the normal day to day administration is bound to undermine and weaken their position. The Congress Ministers have more than once declared their determination to take adequate action in the matter of violent cfime, and the risk run in releasing prisoners especially when they have abjured the path of violence, is altogether imaginary.The Congress has given during the past few months ample evidence of its desire to take severe notice of indiscipline and breach of the code of non-violence that the Congress
l338hd-85-19-5-38-gipshas laid down for itself. Nevertheless, the Congress invites the attention of Congressmen to the fact that indiscipline in speech and action, calculated to promote or breed violence, retards the progress of the country towards its cheriuhed goal.In pursuit of its programme of release of political prisoners the Congress has not hesi-tated to sacrifice office and the opportunity of passing ameliorative measures. But the Congress wishes to make clear that it strongly disapproves of hunger strikes for release. Hunger strikes embarrass the Congress in &quot;puryuit of policy of securing release of political prisoners. The Congress therefore urges those still continuing their hunger strike in the Punjab to give up their strike and assures them that whether in provinces where Congress men hold Ministerial offices or in other provinces, Congress men will continue their efforts to secure the release of detenus and political prisoners by all legislation-legitimate and peaceful means.In view of the situation that has arisen in the country, the Congress authorises the Working- Committee to take such action as it may consider necessary and to take the direction of the Ail-India Congress Committee in dealing with the crisis whenever necessary -sity arises for it.Moved by Yallabhai J. Patel.Seconded, by Sarat Chandra Bose. .Supported by: J- Shri Krishna Sinha-. i3. P. H. Patwardhan.15. Kisan Sabhas.In view of certain difficulties that have arisen in regard to the Kisan Sabhas and other organisations in some parts of India, the Congress desires to clarify the position and state its attitude in regard to them. The Congress has already fully recognised the right of Kisans to organise themselves in peasant unions. Nevertheless it must be remembered that the Congress itself is in the main a Kisan organisation and as its contacts with, the masses have increased vast numbers of Kisans have joined it and influenced its policy. The Congress must, and has in fact, stood for these Kisan masses and championed their claims, and has worked for the independence of India which must be based on the freedom from exploitation of all our people. In order to achieve this independence and strengthen the Kisans and realise their demands it is essential that the Congress be strengthened and that Kisans should be invited to join it in ever larger numbers and organised to carry on their struggle under its banner. It is thus the duty of every Congressman to work for the spread of the Congress organisation in every village in India and not to do anything which weakens this organisation in any way.While fully recognising the right of the Kisans to organise Kisan Sabhas, the Congress cannot associate itself with any activities which are incompatible with the basic principles of the Congress and will not countenance any of the activities of those Congress-men who as members of the Kisan Sabhas help in creating an atmosphere hostile to Congress principles and policy. The Congress, therefore, calls upon Provincial Congress Committees to bear in mind and in pursuance of it take suitable action wherever called for.Moved by S. J).
