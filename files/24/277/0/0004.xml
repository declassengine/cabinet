(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT).SECRET.0.?.   125 (38). COPY NO.       iTRING    MUSEUM. Memorandum &quot;by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.The late Lord Rothschild bequeathed to the Trustees of the British Museum his museum and collections at Tring.    The zoological collections are of great interest and value, including many rarities, and the collection of Lepidoptera includes over two million specimens,  including many species represented in no other museum.&apos; The Trustees wish to accept the bequest in view of its great scientific interest and I am willing to sanction the maintenance expenditure involved, which is in the region at present of about  4,000 per annum.It will however be necessary to pass a short Act of Parliament to enable the Trustees to accept the bequest.      It is a condition of the present bequest that the legacy is accepted as an annexe of the British Museum and used in a modified form for zoological research.      The original Act of Incorporation of the British Museum stated that the collections were to be kept in one general repository, and amending Acts have had to be passed to enable portions of the collections to be housed at South Kensington and Hendon.      A further Act will be necessary to moke similar provision to enable the new acquisitions to be housed at Tring.I should be glad to have the authority of my colleagues to prepare the necessary Bill and to submit it to the Home Affairs Committee.    I do not anticipate that it will be controversial.(Intldo ) J. S.E-zssasttSSjPa,Chambers , SoV/,1. May 20th,  1938.
