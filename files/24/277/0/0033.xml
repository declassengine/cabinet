Copy No!CP. 152 (38).TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special eare may be taken to ensure the secrecy of this document.CABINET.ASSISTANCE TO CHINA.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.A VERY important, urgent and difficult question arises for decision, viz., whether His Majesty&apos;s Government should provide support for the Chinese currency, which is in a critical condition. Unless a substantial loan or credit can be made available, the Chinese Government will almost certainly be forced to suspend the service of their foreign debts and to restrict still further the convertibility of their currency. This must inevitably lead to a further fall in the Shanghai exchange (which cannot be controlled by the Chinese Government) and may precipitate a flight from the currency and a run on the Chinese Banks which could only be stopped by declaring a bank moratorium. The adverse effects of such measures would be felt not only by all trading and financial interests in China, but would extend to the political sphere; once the confidence of the Chinese people in the currency is undermined, the Central Government may itself be disrupted and China broken up into a number of separate regimes which would not be able to sustain the burden of resistance to Japan except in the remote interior. On the other hand, Mr. Rogers, who is the Adviser of the Chinese Central Bank, and who is in this country until the end of this week, takes the view that (apart from unforeseen developments) a loan or credit of twenty millions should enable the position to be held for a substantial period probably a year  before which time the Chinese hope that Japan may be sufficiently exhausted to make peace on reasonable terms.2. Other proposals have been made on previous occasions for affording help to the Chinese Government, but for one reason or another no action was found possible in regard to them, and it appears clear that no loan of substantial amount can be raised without a British Government guarantee. Meanwhile, the Chinese Government continue to ask what we can do to implement the League Resolution, and on the 21st June I informed the Chinese Ambassador &quot; that we would be ready to consider any practicable proposals and would be glad to find some way of affording financial assistance to China in accordance with the League Resolutions that would not be open to the objections which we had felt in regard to the proposals hitherto made,&quot; and I promised to draw the attention of the Chancellor of the Exchequer to these representations. It is evident, therefore, that a decision on this question in the name of the Government as a whole is urgently required.9938X [17481] b
3. Very large issues are involved. The position in the Far East is that Japan aims to dominate and exploit China for the furtherance of the Japanese programme of imperialist expansion. Her more immediate objective is to reduce the Chinese to submission and to recoup the unexpectedly heavy cost of the war by exploiting to the utmost the occupied areas in north and central China. T/liis is to be done by monopolising the foreign trade of the country to the detriment of the influence and commerce of other nations, especially British trade and influence, which has predominated in China for the last century. The process is already far advanced and the methods have been frankly disclosed. These include puppet governments applying Japanese regulations, a customs administering a discriminatory tariff, a non-convertible currency, the seizure of the railways (belonging to British and other foreign bondholders), the control of all communi-cations and harbours and the establishment of corporations monopolising all important industries and public utilities. If Japan wins the war there can be little doubt that British influence will be excluded, British financial interests largely lost, and British trade with China will within a short period be reduced to negligible proportions.4. The only serious resistance now being offered to the accomplishment of this programme is that of the Chinese people. They are fighting gallantly for their independence and incidentally they are fighting the battles of the British and the Russians, who may be regarded as the next obstacles to the fulfilment of the Japanese imperial destiny. The Russians have recognised the obligation by supplying China with aeroplanes and other war material. The Chinese, however, are desperately in need of financial assistance and are asking Great Britain for help in this respect. Their immediate danger is a collapse of the currency on account of the depletion of the foreign exchange reserves on which the note issue is secured. Apart from the direct and harmful effects on local British interests, such as banks and industrial enterprises, a collapse of the currency would probably entail a default in the service of China&apos;s foreign obligations and possibly the disintegration of the Chinese Government itself and the end of organised military resistance to Japan.5. The best hope for the preservation of British influence and interests in China lies in a prolongation of the hostilities until Japan is exhausted, or at least until she is brought through war-weariness to a state of mind when she will be ready to invoke the mediation of third Powers and accept terms of peace that would allow a fair share of the China market to other nations. Apart, therefore, from the obligations assumed at Geneva there are cogent reasons of self-interest why His Majesty&apos;s Government should grant financial assistance to China.6. As stated above, it is estimated that the sum of  20 million would enable China to maintain the currency and prolong the war for another year while con-tinuing the service of her existing foreign debts. It is understood that the Chinese Government would be prepared to offer the best security available (whether a charge on Customs or exports of wolfram or both). These securities should be valuable if China survives the war, but they are in present circumstances admittedly precarious. Repayment would be looked for in the distant future and possibly in benefits other than cash. There is also the danger of Japanese resent-ment, of which Sir R. Craigie has spoken very gravely, and the likelihood of an intensified obstruction to British interests in the occupied areas. It is not probable, however, that Japan, who is already in serious difficulties over the China campaign and has to be prepared for a Russian war, would go to the length of provoking a conflict with Great Britain. There is, of course, the possibility that another year of warfare may leave the combatants in the same relative position and that a further loan to China may then be required for the same purpose. On the other hand, if China is not able to maintain an organised resistance, we may soon find ourselves face to face with a Japan flushed with success, allied with the &quot; Have-not &quot; Powers in Europe and with her hands free to pursue her expan-sionist ambitions in the South Seas and throughout Asia. It is undeniably a gamble, but we have to choose between two very disagreeable alternatives : (1) Either we can make a loan now, atrthe price of possible or perhaps probable loss of a large part of it, and if Sir R. Craigie is right, of incurring just Japanese resentment, in the hope of saving something in the future, or (2) we must resign ourselves to accepting the probable extinction of British interests in China, with
all that that means to us economically and politically, consoling ourselves with the almost certainly illusory hope of Japanese gratitude for our self-restraint, .7. It is difficult to assess with any accuracy the monetary value of the British interests referred to, but it is probably in the neighbourhood of some  200 million. That loss in itself would obviously be considerable, but there is more to it than that. China at the beginning of&quot; last year offered probably the most promising field in the world at that time for economic expansion. Not only did it appear likely that she could absorb in the course of the next ten years aii increasing quantity of British exports, but also she could, by taking the&quot; exports of other people, have added considerably to that world prosperity on which we must at all times so largely depend. The Japanese invasion has already largely extinguished any hopes we may have entertained regarding the contribution to. the expansion of world trade afforded by the development of the China market. Japanese plans for the future exploitation of China will effectually rule.out the extension of non-Japanese enterprise in China and cause the early extinction of existing foreign enterprise on the model of what has been done in Manchuria. In fine, if the Japanese are allowed to give effect to their known plans, British interests in China will be strangled, the retention of Hong Kong rendered problematic, and a severe blow struck at British prestige in the Pacific, with possibly grave consequences to the unity of the Empire.8. There is no doubt at all that we are under the strongest moral obligation to help China so far as we prudently can, both because she is the victim of outrageous aggression and because of the League Resolutions to which we are a party. It may well be that the maintenance of Chinese currency is an important-British interest, in view of the financial consequences which would ensue if it&apos; collapsed, though the view of the Bank of England is that it is not essential that we should give a loan to China to protect the position of British banks, and that we ought not to use the position of these banks publicly as a defence for making a loan to China, since this would cast discredit on their position which is, in fact, undeserved. But the question which transcends all others in the matter is not a ^ merely financial question, but one of high general policy, viz., whether assistance of this sort given to China is going to bring about such resentment in Japan as that of which Sir R. Craigie has warned us, with grave consequences which might not be limited to the Far East. The Japanese Government have constantly assured Sir R. Craigie that they are anxious to avert any breakdown of the Chinese currency, and this was repeated as recently as the 14th May, when the Vice-Minister for Foreign Affairs said that &quot; it was to the interest of the Japanese to maintain the Chinese currency, as, if it deteriorated, it would adversely affect the new currency in the north &apos;&apos; not to mention the Japanese yen. On the other hand, Sir R. Craigie, in his telegram of the same date, warns us that, &apos;&apos; while more moderate elements appreciate that the maintenance of China&apos;s currency stability is in Japan&apos;s ultimate interest, there are other influential elements who urge that, Japan&apos;s first business being to win the war, undermining of China&apos;s currency and credit is a means to this end.&quot;9. More recently, however, the Ambassador would appear somewhat to have modified his views regarding the dangers of incurring Japanese resentment on this subject. In his telegram No. 772 of the 24th June, referring to Anglo-Japanese conversations in Shanghai on measures to deal with a possible currency crisis, he expresses the opinion that the Japanese are nervous about the financial situation in the occupied areas, and that our bargaining position is now stronger. He thinks, therefore, that we can safely hint to the Japanese that, &quot; unless they can put forward proposals which secure our rights and interests and tend to increase rather than restrict trade, we shall be forced to consider measures for our own protection, such as credits in support of the Chinese currency.&quot; But it is right to make it clear that the course suggested as alternative (1) in paragraph 6 above is at once more definite and immediate, as it is also based on wider con-siderations, than anything suggested by Sir R. Craigie, and it may be taken that he would regard it with misgiving.10. If, however, His Majesty&apos;s Government do decide in principle to give financial assistance to the Chinese, its most suitable form would be a loan to maintain the currency, since this could be represented, in answer to Japanese protests, as a measure for the protection not only of British interests, but also of[17481] b 2
Japanese interests. Such a loan would require legislation, which would presumably take the form of a short Bill authorising the conclusion of a Loan Agreement, the text of which would have to be negotiated with the Chinese Government and be appended. Doubtless the pretext that the support of the Chinese currency served Japanese as well as British interests would not remove Japanese objections, for the real motive for the loan would not be hidden from them; but in such a matter it is important for reasons of publicity, and not least from the point of view of the Japanese Government in dealing with their own , people, that a plausible explanation should be provided for the transaction.11. It has been suggested that the United States should be sounded as to whether they would join in some scheme of assistance to support the Chinese currency. The draft of a telegram prepared for this purpose is annexed, but before the telegram is sent it is desirable to decide what the intentions and policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the matter are. The United States Government might be unwilling to join in such a scheme and could reply that they had already provided assistance to China by buying silver from her. It would be unfortunate if Japan were to learn that America had declined to join in a plan put forward by His Majesty&apos;s Government, and it follows that the major point of policy should be decided first.Conclusion.12. Apart from the financial considerations that arise, my view is that the necessitjr and the possibility of doing something to protect British interests and prestige in China and in Asia should on balance outweigh the risk and consequences of Japanese resentment.July 1, 1938.Enclosure.Draft Telegram to Sir R. Lindsay (Washington).(Confidential.)FOLLOWING for Bewley from Treasury :-&quot;Rogers, who has been acting as Adviser to Chinese Central Bank, reports that situation of currency is critical. Reserves in hand are scarcely more than sufficient to cover commitments maturing in next few months. As result of fall of Shanghai exchange, exporters are holding back export bills wherever possible and remittances from overseas Chinese are not reaching Central Bank. Unless a substantial loan or credit can be made available, he fears that restrictions must be placed on transfers involving suspension of foreign loan service. He fully realises grave effects such a measure would &apos; have on Chinese credit and banks, and fears that it may lead to disruption of Chinese Government, but he sees no alternative in present circumstances. He anticipates that loan of  20 million would enable position to be held for a year, before which time it may be hoped that hostilities will be terminated.&quot;His Majesty&apos;s Government have examined most carefully various proposals for raising credits for Chinese Government, but it appears clear that these cannot be realised on a commercial basis, and that only possibility would be a guaranteed loan.&quot; His Majesty&apos;s Government have had this possibility under considera-tion, but any loan issued by them alone to China would undoubtedly provoke violent protests from Japan. These criticisms might to some extent be met if (as His Majesty&apos;s Government would propose) the loan moneys were controlled so as to ensure that they Were utilised solely for currency maintenance. But it would be far easier for His Majesty&quot;s Government to contemplate such an operation if the United States Government could participate in it. We should, therefore, like to know whether, if His Majesty&apos;s Government will guarantee a Chinese currency loan of  10 million here, the United States Government could make available a similar amount in United States dollars.
&quot;We would propose that,, in order to ensure effective use of loan, proceeds, they should be drawn upon only on counter-signatures of Rogers and Young, the, American adviser to Chinese Ministry of Finance, who have been working together closely. We have not yet considered question of security, but would suggest&apos; that Chinese Government should give charge on Customs and salt in priority to all domestic loans. If operation were agreed in principle, we would propose to get T. V. Soong to come over and arrange details. . ,&quot; Would you arrange to see Morgenthau as soon as possible and put the above to him as a personal and secret message from the Chancellor of the Exchequer.&quot; Rogers emphasises that every week that passes makes situation more difficult to hold and if action is to be undertaken preliminaries should be arranged at earliest possible date. Chancellor would therefore be grateful for earliest possible reply.&quot;
