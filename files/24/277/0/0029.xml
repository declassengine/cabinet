AIR MISSION TO The Conference of Ministers met to considerTHE UNITED STATESAND CANADA: a Memorandum (CP.  143 (38)) by the Secretary ofCREATION OP A war potential FOR AIR- State for Air on the subject of the Air Mission CRAFT PRODUCTIONIN CANADA. to the United States and Canada, and the creationof a war potential for aircraft production in Canada.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR said that the considerations in regard to the problem were sufficiently set out in his Memorandum.    It would be remembered that the Cabinet had authorised the despatch of the Air Mission to the United States and Canada and that in pursuance of Cabinet 26 (38) Conclusion 6 a decision on the purchase of aircraft from the United States had been taken.    This proposal for the creation of a war potential for aircraft production in Canada was,    as would be seen from his Memorandum,  a long-range proposition, the acceptance of which would be advantageous,  not only because it would contribute to our air strength and resources, but also because of the great effect which it would have in Germany and in the smaller European countries when it was published to the world that we were entering into arrangements of this character with Canada.THE PRIME MINISTER said that it seemed clear that there could be no question of Canadian industry being able to produce aircraft under trie arrange-ments contemplated within the next two years, and these proposals could not therefore be regarded as in any way contributing to our immediate rearmament programme.      The relevant considerations appeared to be :
(l) The possibility of bringing one of theDominions into active co-operation in the arrange-ments for the defence of the United Kingdom and the Empire as a whole.    On this aspect of the matter the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs would no doubt be able to inform the Meeting of the weight to be attached to the prospects of Canadian co-operation in future in such matters.(2) The effect which the announcement of the arrahge-ments would be likely to have in Berlin and in the smaller European countries.(3) The financial aspects of the proposals on which, no doubt, the Chancellor of the Exchequer would have something to say. He (the Prime Minister) had invited the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to attend the Meeting.      Lord Halifax had been prevented from attending the Meeting by a previous engagement, but had told him that he held no strong views on the subject, that he recognised on the one hand the seriousness of the additional expense involved in the proposal, while on the other he was anxious that no opportunity should be lost of augmenting our fighting strength and so of increasing our authority and influence in the counsels of the world.      It seemed to him (Lord Halifax) that the advantages and disadvantages of trie proposals were nicely balanced.
He (the Prime Minister) understood that the Secretary of State for Air thought that if the special Mission was successful in negotiating a considered scheme in Canada ad referendum it would he extremely difficult for the Government to refuse to endorse a satisfactory scheme so negotiated in the absence of any appreciable change in the interval of the international situation.      He also gathered that the principal object of the Mission would be to arrange for the production in Canada of large bomber air-craft of Be 12/36 type,  and that in order to ensure such production,   the extensive and elaborate organisation out-lined in paragraphs (b) and (c) on page 2 of CP.   143 (38) would have to be established in Canada.      It moreover appeared that the Secretary of State hoped,  by encouraging &quot;marriages&quot; of individual Canadian firms with United Kingdom &quot;partners&quot; to create a war potential in Canada for certain types of aircraft other than the large bomber class.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR observed that this proposal referred to in (a) on page 2 of his Memorandum must be regarded as a separate proposal to the proposal outlined in (b), (e), (d) and (e) for the production of large bomber aircraft.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DOMINION AFFAIRS very strongly welcomed the proposals in CP.  143 (38) as the first real indication of Canada&apos;s intention to change her policy of isolation in matters of imperial defence.    He hoped that this beginning would lead to further and other important developments.      For example,  the First Lord of the Admiralty had told him that a Mro  Stevens,  a
representative of Canadian Vickers had been making-enquiries about the possibility of building a destroyer in Canada.     If *this proposal eventuated it was contem-plated that we should buy back from Canada one of the modern destroyers which we had recently sold to her.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR mentioned that the Canadian High Commissioner in London had expressed the view that acceptance of the proposals in CP.  143 (38) would be of value in getting the Canadian Government to take a more active interest in other proposals for co-operation in imperial defence as, for example,  the arrangements for the recruitment and training of pilots and other Canadian air personnel.THE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OF DEFENCE agreed that there were signs that the Canadian Government were taking a more active interest in such matters.    Mr. Stevens had told him that he and his friends were deter-mined to make the Canadian Government realise their responsibilities in regard to defence.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DOMINION AFFAIRS agreed, and pointed out that at the present time a certain amount of political capital was being made in Canada Out of the alleged reluctance on the part of the Canadian Government to co-operate in measures of air defence, such as their turning down of the establishment of a Flying School in Canada.    It was accordingly most important that in any action we might take we should keep in step with the Canadian government
THE PRIME MINISTER thought that Mr.  Mackenzie King would be likely to prove very susceptible to any substantial Canadian criticism of this nature.THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER said that on the general merits he was impressed with the strength of the considerations urged in favour of acceptance of the proposals of the Secretary of State for Air. Such matters as the importance of ensuring the greatest measure of co-operation in Imperial Defence;    the strategical consequences of the proposals being implemented;    the effect on our prestige and reputation throughout the world and the strengthening of our position vis-a-vis the Totalitarian States all combined to lead him to the conclusion that on general grounds these proposals should be accepted in principle.He thought, however, that the time had come when it was imperative that a real effort should be made to bring Treasury financial control and responsibility and the numerous and growing activities of the Air Ministry into greater harmony and on to more normal and customary lines.      It should be noted for example that the particular proposals in CP.  143(38) involved new and important commitments quite outside the figures which had been discussed between the Air Ministry and the Treasury.      He wished to make a special appeal to the Secretary of State to assist in restoring the relations between his Department and the Treasury in regard to Treasury control to the levels which obtained in the other spending Departments.
The Air Ministrys approved programme covered the production of 12,000 aircraft by March, 1940.      The Treasury had so far failed to obtain the estimate of the cost of these aircraft in the current financial year and in the financial year 1939-1940.      In the absence of these figures it was of course quite impossible to proceed with the &quot;rationing&quot; of the Service Departments on the lines laid down by the Cabinet.      The whole position would be easier to manage from the point of view of the Treasury if that Department knew precisely what the liabilities in respect of the aircraft production programme were going to be and he would therefore be  glad if Sir Kingsley Wood could, as soon as was conveniently possible, supply the Treasury with the estimated cost of the programme in the present and in the next financial year and thereafter.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR AIR said that everything possible would be done to furnish the Treasury with the supplementary estimate for the current year in the immediate future.      The estimate for 1939-1940 would also be available shortly.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER hoped that it would also be possible to let the Treasury have the estimates of cost of the programme to be met after 1939-1940.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR said that he was still very anxious and very uncertain as to how we should stand vis-a-vis Germany when the present approved
programmes of air expansion had been completed.      He did not see how any Member of the Government could take the line either in Parliament or in the country that we could not hope adequately to defend ourselves because our financial ^resources were inadequate.THE&apos; CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER said that he wished to offer some observations on the proposals contained in CP. 143(38).     As the Prime Minister had pointed out these proposals aimed at creating a war potential beyond the two remaining years of the re-armament programme. It should, however, be recalled that there were a large number of proposals for creating and increasing war potential in this country which were of varying degrees of magnitude and which had reached different stages of development.      He thought that there was much to be said for the Air Ministry being invited to set out their different war potential proposals indicating in each case what the proposal would provide and how much it was estimated to cost.He fully agreed that the suggestion for the creation of a war potential for aircraft production in Canada was an important matter but in his view it should not be treated as something additional to the Air Ministry^ regular programme.      In this connection it should be remembered that several important undertakings had expressed grave doubts about the Nuffield Scheme.      Was it not probable that aircraft manufacturers in the United Kingdom would represent that they had all the necessary experience,  the skilled labour and the technical facilities and were therefore in a position to manufacture aircraft much quicker, cheaper and more
efficiently than the Canadian manufacturers could ever hope to do?     There might he a good answer to criticisms of this character and no doubt an   answer based on the wider political and &quot;other considerations could effectively be made but he- must seriously urge that we should take every possible step to produce an ordered plan of the war potential arrangements as if we did not do so we should be incurring very serious financial and other risks-     He could not agree to this expenditure of some  3^ million in Canada except as part and parcel of a well thought out and carefully designed plan of the whole war potential resources of the Government.It appeared to him that (a)  on page 2 of Co P.   143(58) was not necessarily connected with the proposals for the provision of the large bomber aircraft in (b) ( c) (d) and (e).      Did the Secretary of State for Air ask for authority to proceed with (a) as well as with the large bomber scheme.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR AIR said that he was asking for authority to proceed with both proposals.THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER asked whether the Air Ministry were quite clear that the proposed large bomber aircraft of the Bo 12/36 type was sufficiently tested out and developed for its production in large quantities to be entrusted to the inexperienced hands of the Canadian industry.      It would of course be quite a different thing to give the Canadian industry some standardised article to produce but was it really wise to entrust this infant and inexperienced industry with the production in large quantities of a very complex machine when that industry was destitute of design, development and organisation as we knew it in this country.
THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR AIR said that he was grateful to the Chancellor of the Exchequer for his helpful attitude.The Secretary of State informed the Committee thathe regarded the proposed creation of a war potential inCanada as a matter entirely separate from any otherproject before the Air Ministry.     The present project was a direct consequence of the decision taken &quot;by theCabinet to despatch the Air Mission to the United Statesand Canada;    it fell therefore into a special category.The announcement issued by the Air Ministry on June 9thregarding the results of the Air Mission had concluded with the following paragraph:-&quot;The mission also pursued certain discussions with firms in Canada as to the possibility of bringing into being increased capacity in that country for the manufacture of aircraft on a long-range plan.     The Government have under consideration certain tentative proposals which have been formulated as a result of those discussions.&quot;Turning to the question of the Air Ministry&apos;s war potential as a whole, Sir Kingsley Wood said that he did not believe that much was to be gained at the present stage by drawing up for publication an ordered and correlated p&quot;!3n covering the whole fields   The immediate object ^vas to give the ,; country a greater feeling of security.      It seemed to him that the best way of achieving this end. would be to bring to the public attention a few good examples of spheres in which a war potential was immediately available.     Canada might be one such sphere, Lord Nuffield&apos;s plans another.This would be the most economical way of proceeding as well as the most practical.     The findings of the position could be reviewed at every stage, as a new form of war potential was brought forward for approval.      It
was also a way in which our preparations could be related to the   constant    changes in the international situation.To draw up a comprehensive plan for a war potential for the information of his Cabinet colleagues was of course a different matter.      If they wished to see such a plan, he (the Secretary of State) would gladly have it prepared and circulated.     A complete survey of the position was at the moment talcing place in the Air Ministry.THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER called attention to- -the fact that setting up a war potential of large bombers in Canada was going to be considerably more expensive than if the aircraft were ordered in the United Kingdom.THE PRIME MINISTER called attention to the estimate at the head of page 3 of CP.  143 (38), viz. that the cost in Canada would be in the neighbourhood of 25 per cent,  to 331 per cent, higher.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR AIR observed that this was an additional price which, if we approved his proposal, we should be deliberating paying for reasons which would not apply in the case of other parts of the war potential. The reasons would be the considerable International effect which our decision would be likely to produce, and the great advantage of the close co-operation of one of the Dominions in our defence programme.Sir Kingsley Wood realised that if the orders were placed in Canada he might have to face some criticism from the British aircraft industry.     He did not think that this criticism would be very formidable.      Our industry would themselves recognise that the wider view must prevail.Sir Kingsley Wood added that if it was thought
desirable his proposals at (a) on page 2 of CP. 143 (38) could be considered separately from his proposals at (b) to (d) - i.e. the second could be adopted without the first.     He hoped, however, that his colleagues would approve both.THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER remarked that the proposal at (a) was described as &quot;the encouragement of &quot;marriages&apos; of individual Canadian firms with United Kingdom &apos;partners&apos;.&quot;     Did this mean that the Treasury would be called upon to give wedding presents?THE PRIME MINISTER was afraid that this was clearly the expectation.     The plan was that British firms should allocate a proportion of their orders to Canadian firms.     This would mean that there would be additional cost in carrying out that part of the orders, and the Treasury would have to find the difference.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR AIR said that a decision on (a) was not necessarily required at the present moment. Indeed all that we need perhaps say to the Mission was that the Government were generally sympathetic to the proposals in CP.  143 (38), and wished the Mission&apos;s report to cover these proposals as a whole.     He (Sir Kingsley) would welcome it if a good financial man could be included in the Mission.      The Government ought not to commit, ... &apos; &apos; .       &apos;     .&apos;      ......        .... ......       .....themselves finally to either part until they had seen1what the cost was going to be.In reply to a question, the Minister explained that the aircraft in paragraph (a) would have to be shipped to this country.      The large bomber class, on the other hand,  could fly the Atlantic.
THE PRIME MINISTER reminded his colleagues of the hope expressed by Lord Nuffield that it should be possible to reduce the costs of aircraft manufacture by as much as one-third.    If this hope were fulfilled the disparity between the United Kingdom and Canadian costs would be even more striking.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR AIR said that his Department were not as sanguine on this point as Lord Nuffieldo    He greatly hoped, however, that Lord Nuffield&apos;s prophecy would be justified.    The Canadian industry v/ould be able to share in the advantages of any new methods which Lord Nuffield was able to introduce.THE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OP DEFENCE observed that Lord Nuffield had admitted   that the methods of mass production were not suitable In the case of modern military aircraft.THE PRIME MINISTER thought that the discussion might be oummod up by saying that the Conference of Ministers had agreed in principle  &apos;to    Sir Kingsley Wood&apos;s proposals as regards the large bomber class of aircraft.    They had not, however, accepted in principle the proposal regarding other types of aircraft in paragraph (a) of page 2 of CP. 143(38).THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER suggested that one qualification   ought to be added as regards the large bombers, viz. that the Government would have to satisfy itself in the light of the Mission&apos;s   Report that the finance of the scheme was reasonableaTHE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR AIR said that he entirely agreed.
WAR POTENTIAL In reply to a question by the Prime MinisterFOR AIRCRAFT:THE AIR THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR explained the generalMINISTRY&apos;plans position of his Department&apos;s plans for war potential.considered as A WHOLE.      Broadly speaking the situation was that it was impossible to place any further orders for delivery within the next two years.    All the available space for production was booked^,   No new developments that could be foreseen were at all likely to alter this situation.The creation of war potential for an emergency after the expiration of the two years was a different story. Here    expansion was possible by bringing ina number of new firms, and placing educational orders.    The new firms would have Jo be associated with existing larger organisations.    The new factories would have to be placed &quot;in vaseline&quot; in peace-time.THE PRIME MINISTER asked if there was an estimate of the additional capacity available.THE MINISTER FOR CO-ORDINATION OF DEFENCE saidIthat the Supply Committee had not yet seen their way to making plans for filling the gap,, which was an enormous one.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIR said   that his Department ought soon to be able to complete their survey. He hoped, however, that it was understood that he need not wait for the completion of the survey if any favourable method of securing additional war potential presented itself.    He wished to be in a position to indicate to the House of Commons that certain definite tasks were in hand and to say what these were.
THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER said that hewould nevertheless lilce to see a comprehensive statementofof the whole position/which the separate items of war potential formed a part.:THE PRIME MINISTER said that presumably eachaitem that was put in hand would mean/certain capital expenditure and the placing of an educational order.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR AIR said that he would give instructions at once for the comprehensive survey which the Chancellor desired.    Prom a financial point of view the survey would not prove pleasant reading.      It would show the very great cost of entering into competition with Germany in aircraft production.Recommend- The Conference of Ministers agreed to submitat ions and conclusions the following recommendations to the Cabinet on theof Conferenceof Ministers.      proposals of the Secretary of State for Air contained in cp.   143 (38) i-(l) That the Secretary of State for Air should he authorised to send immed-iately a special Mission to Canada for the purpose of negotiating ad referendum a considered scheme &quot;(after close local investigations and dis-cussions with all parties concerned including financial and commercial interests v/hose backing is essential to the success of such a plan) for the production of large loraber aircraft on the general lines indicated in (b), (c),  (d) and (e) of paragraph 7 of CP.  143 (38),  and subject to the conditions and qualifications set out in paragraph 8 of that Paper,  and subject also to the Mission.s being able to secure reasonably satisfactory financial terms    from the Canadian manufacturers.
Obi)(2) That it must he recognised that it would be extremely difficult for His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom to refuse endorsement of a satisfactory scheme so negotiated by the Mission unless inter-national problems changed appreciably in the interval.      Accordingly it will be understood that if the Mission are able to negotiate a scheme satisfactory in all respects, including the financial terms to be arranged with the Canadian manu-facturers, the Government will confirm that scheme in the absence in the inter-val of any appreciable alteration in the international situation.(3) That the Mission should be authorised to explore with the Canadian interests con-cerned the proposal in (a) of paragraph 7 of CP.  143 (38) for the alliance of individual Canddian firms with United Kingdom firms, with a view to the product-ion under licence in Canada of an allocated portion of orders for specified types of aircraft pother than the large bomber class covered by (l) and (2) above) placed by the Air Ministry with the United Kingdom firms. It being clearly understood that His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom are in no way committed in principle or otherwise at the present stage to the adoption of this part of the proposals of the Secretary of State for Air.(4) That the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs and the Secretary of State for Air should be invited to settle in consultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the terms of a telegram to be sent to the Canadian Government in the event of the Cabinet approving the recommendations set out in (l),  (2) and (3) above.(5) To take note that the Secretary of State for Air has agreed to circulate to the Cabinet in due course the results of a comprehensive survey now being undertaken by the Air Ministry of the whole position relating to war potential for aircraft production from all source^.      Tne inform-ation in question will summarise all the different war potential schemes,  and will indicate in each case what eS-ch scheme will provide and how much it  is estimated to cost.
(6) To take note that the Secretary of State for Air has undertaken to furnish the Chancellor of the Exchequer as soon as he can possibly do so with the supplementary estimate for the current financial year in respect of the expenditure in 1938-39 on the Air Ministry&apos;s approved programme for the production of 12,000 aircraft by March, 1940;    voith the  estimate for the expenditure on this particular service in the financial year 1939-40,  and with the estimate of the cost of the service to be met after 1939-40.(7) To take note that in the view of the Chancellor of the Exchequer it was imperative that normal Treasury financial control and responsibility in regard to the numerous and growing activities of the Air Ministry should be re-established without delay in. order that the relations between the Treasury and the Air Ministry in regard to the financial control of the. Treasury over expenditure by the Air Ministry should be assimilated to the arrangements in force in regard to other spending Departments.2, Whitehall Gardens,  S. W. 1. 25th.  June,  1938.
