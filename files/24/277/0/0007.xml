SECRET.CP.  186(58) .Copy NoC A B &apos;I N E T&apos;oPROPOSED AMENDMENT TO PETROLEUM BYELAWS -ALTERNATIVE OF A PIPE LINE FROM PURFLEET TO THAMESHAVENoMemorandum by the Minister for Co-ordination ofDefence.At the meeting of the Cabinet held on the 25th May9 1938,, x i was asked to^examine the possibility of a pipe line from Purfleet to Thameshaven9 as an alternative to the proposed amendment to the Petroleum Byelaws to permit oil tankers carrying petrol to come up the Thames as far as Purfleet.2.      I have not tried to obtain an estimate of the cost of a pipe line, as I understood information is not wanted on this point at any rate at this stage.      The proposal is open to several strong objections.3.      There is in the first place a risk of fire resulting from a pipe line in peace time.Petrol and the vapoui? which it gives off are so highly inflammable that there would always be a measure of fire risk even in the case of an above-ground pipe line. The dangers in the case of an underground pipe might be much more serious.      Once a pipe line has been put underground, there is no means whereby leakage of petrol or vapour can be detected;    if a leak should occur, the first intimation of it is likely to be an explosion. A constant patrol and inspection system would be necessaryCabinet 26(38)10.
though this would provide no guarantee against this risk. There is a^aratively little experience of pipe lines to carrymotor spirit.     All the big pipe lines have been for crude oil&quot;.     Spirit pipe lines are a recent innovation and ithas been found that corrosion is more rapid.     It is almost certain that for the above reasons the strongest objectionswould be raised by Local Authorities concerned to the installation of either an above-ground or an undergroundpipe line to carry petrol through the populous area between Thameshaven and Purfleet.&apos; &apos; - ; .      &apos;/ ... :: -4. Prom the point of view of war-time riskss there arestrong defence reasons against a pipe line.     Those against&apos;&apos;-.V- .:v&apos; - &apos;    :an above-ground pipe line may be summarised as follows:-(a) In time of emergency the risks of sabotagewould be very great.     The shortest distance for pipe lines betweens says Thameshaven and Purfleet would be about 15 miles.     If built-up areas were to be avoided the line would be much longer.     The lines would have to cross riverss major roadsj railways5 and numerous minor roads and footpaths.(b) In view of the risks of sabotage,  increased0&apos; -patrolling of the pipe lines would beessentiale      The provision of guards wouldbe a large commitment.(c) The risks of damage by air attack would bevery great.      &quot;Near Misses&quot; by high explosive bombs aimed at important targets along the river would be liable to fracture the pipe lines with the consequent danger of conflagrationo(d) The unloading of tankers direct into a pipeline would be impracticable owing tothe great length of time it would take to
discharge a single tanker,  100 hours for an 18,000 T. tanker as compared with 24 hours. It would therefore he necessary to have storage tanks at the point of discharge atThameshaven. Owing to the various grades of oil a number of separate tanks would be necessary.      These would provide that vulnerable above-ground target which it is the object of the scheme to avoid.      In the opinion of the Air Staff, no reliance whatever can be placed on the security of above-groxmd storage in the Thames area.5. The defence objections to an underground pipe lineare equally strong.     Although the risks of sabotage would not be so great as in the case of above-ground pipe lines, the emergence of the pipe lines at certain points would be unavoidable, and all these points v/ould be danger spots which would have to be guarded.    . In war, even if no direct hit were made on the line, the risks of leakage of either petrol or vapour caused by bomb explosions in the vicinity of the pipes would be considerable.(Intd.)
