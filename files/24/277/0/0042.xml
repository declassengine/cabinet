Printed for the Cabinet.   July 1938.SECRET. Copy No.CP. 161 .(38).CABINET.ECONOMIC SITUATION IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. I THINK my colleagues may be interested to see the annexed memorandum on the economic situation in the United States of America  prepared by Mr. F. Ashton-Gwatkin, Head of the Economic Relations Section of the Foreign Office, who has recently returned from a six weeks&apos; visit to the United States.H.Foreign Office, July 7, 1938.ECONOMIC SITUATION IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICAIN MAY  1938.THE United States is easily the largest economic unity in the world.It contains 6 per cent, of the world&apos;s area; 7 per cent, of its population.The United States produces 70 per cent, of the world&apos;s oil, 60 per cent, of its wheat and cotton, 50 per cent, of its copper and pig-iron, 40 per cent, of its lead and coal.The United States imports 56 per cent, of world exports of rubber, 53 per cent, of tin, 72 per cent, of raw silk, 69 per cent, of crude petroleum, 48 per cent, of coffee, 42 per cent, of pig-iron, 47 per cent, of copper, 36 per cent, of coal, 21 per cent, of sugar.The United States operates 80 per cent, of the motor-cars in use in the world, 33 per cent, of the railroads, 60 per cent, of the telephone and telegraph facilities.The United States possesses almost  2,500 million worth of gold; it has two-thirds of civilisation^ banking resources.The purchasing power of the population is greater than that of the 500 million people in Europe, and much larger than that of the 1,000 million Asiatics.At least, this is the statistical picture presented in a Daily Mail article (January 15, 1938); and I have no reason to doubt its general accuracy. The article continues : &quot;Responsible leadership which cannot translate such a bulging economy, into assured prosperity is destitute of capacity.&quot;This brings us to the heart of our problem, which is the reason for the present recession or depression or crisis in America, and the prospect of its relief or continuance.9937   [17466] b
It is of immense importance to the general world situation. The revival of the American market has immediate effect all over the world, and, perhaps, especially in the British Empire, which supplies so many of the raw materials which United States industry requires. British investments in the United States are considerable; and the stock markets of London and New York interact instantaneously. A business revival in America will in no small measure assist the United Kingdom, and the Empire, to carry the increasing financial burdens of rearmament; without this revival, our financial future becomes increasingly perilous.We are therefore vitally concerned in this question of the American recession or depression or obsession. This phenomenon of poverty in the midst of plenty is the prevailing topic in America to-day; and in any company of the propertied classes, among Republicans and a fair number of Democrats too, the topic does not develop far without someone saying : &quot;So long as that man is at the White House there is no hope of recovery.&apos;&apos; There will be even darker prognostications of terrors to come socialism, fascism, communism.Let me say at once that the extreme tendencies seem to me as far from the present situation as the totalitarian ideologies are antagonistic to the average American mind. A mild reform in the direction of centralising and regularising the Civil Service, known as the Reorganisation Bill, was defeated in Congress to the apparent satisfaction of the people at large. The new and to many Americans alarming trades union movement is not nearly so far advanced in achievements, organisation, ideology or political influence and ambition as is the power of our T.U.C.There are perhaps some 11 or 12 million unemployed; and relief is often wastefully applied and unintelligently administered. But at least these people are being supported by a community which can afford to do so. In 1932, when I was last in America, this was not the case; and in the streets of New York at least there was a muttering of incipient revolution, of which there is now no visible sign. Besides, people do not lightly turn to revolution, Fascist or Socialist, unless their political and economic circumstances are such that a very large number have reached the conclusion that any change is preferable to continuance of the present misery.This is very far from being the case in the United States, where people in employment are well paid, and the unemployed well provided for, and the farmer is the spoiled child of the Administration.It is clearly absurd to ascribe the malaise of America to one single man&apos;s personality and vagaries.   If the President were to be eliminated, Wall Street and the Big Business world would heave a sigh of relief, and the stock market would probably rise.   But the underlying problems would remain to confront the next Administration.   These problems were at work in the far greater depression of 1929-32.  The New Deal recognised their existence, which the Hoover regime had refused to do, and confronted them with drastic Government action.   One of the principal dangers of the 1932 situation, the imminent collapse of the banking system, has been successfully exorcised; and the whole American public can have and does have confidence in the security of their deposits.   The level of agricultural prices, too, has been raised, by dubious methods perhaps, but with results that are valuable to the community.   A more real reason for America&apos;s present plight and one to which it is now very fashionable to allude is the closing of the frontier, which occurred some time in the 90&apos;s, the filling up of the country, the final allocation of free land, followed about the end of the war by the practical cessation of large scale immigration, the ending of the period of tropical growth, which has characterised the American economy for the last hundred years, the ending of the period of rugged individualism and risk-taking, which made that growth possible and crowned its success with fantastic personal riches, acquired within a few short years.  There are still rich men in America; but the &apos;&apos; American millionaire &quot; as a type and symbol was killed in the Wall Street crash on the 24th October, 1929.He had long been the guide and inspiration of his fellow-citizens; he had long-been the master of successive administrations, whether Republican or Democrat. He had shown leadership, enterprise, power of organisation-and, as often as not, unscrupulous rapacity. But, owing to the closing of the frontier and its con-sequences, the foundation of his power was slipping away. This development was obscured for a time by the exaggerated prosperity of the war and post-war periods.
America had discovered the secret of making all her people richer and richer. But whereas prosperity before 1914 had been real prosperity, based on the creation of new values, prosperity during and after the war was illusory; it proceeded from non-productive investment, and from the manipulation of values, degenerating into a fever of speculation.And then, as at Belshazzar&apos;s feast, the finger wrote, and over-night the Kingdom was taken away and given to the New Dealers, brain trusters, public money spenders, trades union fans and economic cranks. All over America are subsisting communities of people who retired into Cloud-Cuckoo-Land on the prospects of their 1929 prosperity. These communities are known as cities of the unburied dead.The glad, confident, boastful America has passed away; in its place, is left a country we cannot yet say a nation that has lost its old landmarks, and seems to be staggering forward, leaderless, into an uncertain future.The New Deal restored order, but it has not established leadership. Production and business recovered,for a time under the Roosevelt Administration. It is natural, after all, that a slump should be followed by a boom. Only dictatorships can provide a steady level of prosperity. But Mr. Roosevelt and his advisers, towards the end of 1936 and in the early months of 1937, were afraid that boom conditions might get out of hand.Bank reserve requirements were thereupon tightened up even though there was no sign of any tendency to overlend.This in itself was a deflationary influence.It was followed by a withdrawal from the New York and Chicago banks of funds deposited by the country banks; this was also deflationary and con-sequential on the enforced increase of the reserves.Mr. Sprague, speaking somewhere in Europe, suggested the possibility of a decrease in the United States Treasury price for gold; this caused further deflationary effects and a scare among holders of gold and gold shares.President Roosevelt, speaking on the 2nd April, declared that the prices of commodities, or attany rate of some commodities, was too high. This statement perhaps more than any other cause rocked the markets in the United States and abroad.Further, in April 1937, Government expenditure on relief, &amp;c. was suddenly reduced by about 150 million dollars a month; there was no private enterprise ready to take up the slack.The. &quot;boom &quot; had, therefore, been beaten about the head so ruthlessly that it had fallen down into a slump. For a time, this was called a &quot; recession &quot;; but it is now admittedly a &quot;depression.&quot; Some people have said to me that it is a depression as bad or even worse than that of 1929-33. This is, of course, nonsense on present showing.In that great depression which lasted for a record period of forty-five months, the business and trade index showed a record fall of 59 per cent.; and a corres-ponding fall of stock-market values of 87 per cent. which means a reduction of average values to nearly one-tenth of their former level.The present depression has shown in the course of sixteen months a decline of the business and trade index by 37 per cent.; and in the course of twelve months a stock exchange decline of 49 per cent. It is therefore certainly not -as yet, at any rate so severe as the 1929-33 slump; but, with this one exception, it is &quot; by far the most severe recession in American history &quot; as regards business and trade figures; and on a level with 1901 as regards the stock exchange crash. The German economist who drew my attention to these figures and analogies is far from being pessimistic as to the future. In his view, the depression has almost run its normal course. People go on trading in spite of Governments. When the present stocks or &quot;inventories&quot; of goods awaiting sale are disposed of and this must soon be the case revival will begin.For more than six months, he pointed out, the present consumption level has been standing substantially above the production level, and during this time the country has been living upon &quot; inventories.&quot; * Further, since early April, the deflationary policy of both the Government and the Federal Reserve Board has been sharply reversed.  This is bound to have an effect.Within the range of the present budget (1938-39) there will be a release of public money to the value of 3,500 million dollars to 5,200 million dollars which is bound to have its effect towards the end of the year. At the least, this outlay ought to influence the autumn elections in favour of the President and the [17466] B 2
New Deal; at the most, it ought to lift America out of the present depression to the point at which private enterprise will resume its normal task of promoting economic development.According to this German economist it seems likely (and there are already indications) that April may have marked the turning point of the American business cycle. It seems to him unlikely, however, that the upturn will be sudden or fast. But many indications point, he thinks, to an upturn and there are strong reasons to believe that once it has started late in the summer or early in the autumn it will steadily gain momentum.The New Dealers, whom I saw, like Mr. Marriner Eccles and Mr. Leon Henderson believe in the efficacious and salutary results of public spending, and think that the country is well able to bear the increased burden on the national debt which is still small in comparison with the national income and resources.They are less confident, however, of getting private capital back to work, and evidently share, to some extent, Mr. Roosevelt&apos;s indignation against the financial Bourbons of the old regime.In Republican circles and among bankers and business-men (whether in New York, Chicago or Detroit) even in the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which one might have expected to be partly inoculated with Government serum  I found no such confidence, but varying states of gloom. No recovery in sight; no recovery possible with, the present uncertainties and extravagancies of Washington policy; with &quot; that lunatic &quot; at the White House.To these people, the only immediate hope is in a decisive check to the adminis-tration in the coming elections. At the New York Federal Reserve Bank I was told that an overturn of eighty seats to the Republican party (in a house of 435 members) might be anticipated; Mr. Knox, proprietor of the Chicago Daily News, and a prominent Republican who has run for the vice-presidency, told me between 80 and 100. Apart from this, there is the hope of strengthening the anti-Roosevelt Democrats in Congress that conservative wing of the party who voted against the Presidents Supreme Court and Reorganisation Bills. The recalcitrant Democratic Senators are being opposed by out-and-out Roosevelt candidates in &quot; primary&quot; elections now pending in several States with varying success.    /But what has the Republican party to offer as an alternative to the New Deal ? Nothing; no leader; no programme; nothing but memories of the past, memories bitter rather than sweet to the general electorate. Whereas Roosevelt has saved many from ruin, and has injected hope into still more, and his voice coming over the radio with promises of friendship and help to millions of small struggling homes has by no means lost its magic appeal.I have no direct knowledge of the agricultural districts. The farmers sold their last year crops at good prices; and the depression has hardly yet reached them, though it is likely to do so. On the whole, they support Roosevelt and the Democrats who saved them in 1933; but they are by no means unanimously in favour of the Government policy of subsidising restriction. It goes against the bucolic conscience to be paid for not growing cotton or corn or hogs; and govern-mental regimentation irritates their independence..1 got as far as Madison, capital of the State of Wisconsin a lovely little town built on an isthmus between four lakes. I went there to see Governor Lafollette, who had just publicly inaugurated his new National Progressive party. Whatever may be the future of this new party and of its sponsors, Senator Bob and Governor Phil Lafollette of Wisconsin, its appearance at this moment is not without significance. The old political hands of both parties are saying that third parties have ever had short histories in the United States; the organisation of a party is a slow and complex growth; the Lafollettes are good showmen, they are not statesmen; they will build up a nuisance value, and will then come to terms with one or other of the great historic parties.What Governor Lafollette is saying, has been saying for the last four years, is that America must have a political party that can provide intelligent leader-ship and action.He believes that roosevelt&apos;s political prestige is bankrupt; and that the New Deal, from an economic standpoint, is basically wrong.&quot; I was brought up among farming people,&quot; he said to me, &quot; and my economic ideas and images come from the farm.   A nation&apos;s investment
capital may be likened to the seed gram, which our farmers save against next year&apos;s sowing. The Republican Government left this seed grain unused in the barn; the Democrat Government has devoured it; our progressive party wants to see that seed grain used for its proper purpose, to be sown into the ground and to make the future harvest.&quot;Governor Lafollette then expatiated on the doctrine of the closing of the frontier and its results. But he claimed that there is now a new frontier with even greater possibilities than the old. There is a new America to be constructed on the basis of modern scientific and technical knowledge. For this purpose, what he calls &apos;&apos; corporative or collective individualism &apos;&apos; is required; and elsewhere he refers to &apos;.&apos; harnessing the profit motive for a social end. If private capital won&apos;t take the plunge,&quot; he said to me, &quot; maybe we shall have to push it into the water.&quot;That he believes in State control or at least direction of investment, is clear from the above, as it is clear from point 1 of his new party programme : &quot; The ownership and control of money and credit, without qualification or reservation, must be under public and not private control.&quot; Yet, Governor Lafollette declares that he is not a Socialist; and he believes that his programme could be carried out without having to have a system (as in Germany) of foreign exchange controls.I asked him what he would do with this power to direct investment. He replied that there were two immediate objects crying aloud for modernisation  the railways and housing.The railway system is stifled with mortgages with bonds representing values that have largely disappeared. The first step would be to require an engineering survey to determine what is needed to provide the most efficient transportation system in the world. The next step, to order that this be carried out. Then a judicial proceeding permitting the new capital financing it to step in ahead of the old bonds. This would put three or four billion dollars of idle capital to work, create millions of new jobs, and when done would provide something real to show for the expenditure. It would not destroy the old bonds they would have just what they had before. But in place of idle men and idle money, there would be working money and working men.Similarly, with housing a long overdue task. First, an engineering and architectural survey approved by the individual family affected; secondly, an order that it be carried out; thirdly, an opportunity for new capital to step in; lastly, the job to be done under contracts at the best bid.Governor Lafollette again appealed to his farm economics. The farmer, he said, does not expect a stable return on his crop each year; the crop varies; the price fluctuates. Stability of wages and income is an illusion. The more real approach to the problem would be to assure to each participant in business, as in agriculture, a percentage of the total production.I have given so much space to Governor Lafollette and his programme : first, because he is one of the most interesting and sympathetic personalities whom I met during my visit; and, secondly, because whereas the Republican party represents the past in America, and the New Dealers the present this eager and enthusiastic young administrator stands for the future. His party may or may not succeed in establishing its claims. He himself told me that he was very pleased with his progress so far; he believed that he had a large measure of support, especially from the young people and from those who began their letters with the words : &quot; I am not a politician.&quot; But, generally, in the United States, I understand the launching of the new party is regarded as a flop. However, perhaps in 1944, perhaps in 1948, Governor Phil Lafollette may be President of the United States.Another eminent figure at the present time is that of Mr. John L. Lewis, son of Welsh coalmining immigrants, who is now chairman (and master) of the Committee of Industrial Organisation. This effort to organise labour on the basis of a network of powerful trades unions dates from the early days of the New Deal and the NR.A. It cuts across the distinction between skilled and unskilledjabour, which was accepted by the old (and to the employers inoffensive) organisation of the American Federation of Labour: and aims at constituting in each factory, workshop, railroad and mine a single authority, empowered to act for all the workers and (so the employers say) to dictate what the policy of the management is to be, especially with regard to the hiring and firing of the employees.   The employers object to this interference; they object to the methods
Of terrorism which they say are employed by the C.I.O. in order to force workers to join their unions; they object to what they regard as the unholy alliance between the C.I.O. and the Roosevelt Administration did not John Lewis contribute 500,000 dollars to the funds of the President&apos;s last election campaign? Do not the Government &apos;&apos; conciliators &apos;&apos; in industrial disputes always, always take the workers&apos; part ?But the attitude of State and city authorities varies often according to their politics. In Chicago, I was told, there were no strikes or labour troubles; the mayor and the police had seen to that. I dined with the president of one of the oil companies at a time when there was a strike in one of his refineries. The workers had come out in their automobiles and had parked them in a circle round the works, thus preventing ingress or egress. The cause of&apos; the strike was something comparatively trivial; it was&quot; a trial of strength, and he was not prepared to give in.I visited Akron, the town of rubber tyre factories, on the day after peace had been made in the Goodyear Tyre plant, where a sudden and violent strike had been in progress a strike concerned not with wages and hours, nor even union recognition, but such things as seniority rights, layoffs and reported speed-up plans, questions which should presumably be amenable to routine settlement through shop committees.I found the management of the Akron factories disposed to accept philo-sophically the fact of change in the world of labour; at present, however, they said, the inexperienced and the extremists were leading the movement; the companies must stand up against these elements, and the settlement of the recent strike was, on the whole, a victory for the companies; this phase of violence, intimidation and racket was probably even now on the decline it had lost whatever public sympathy it may have had. Then the time would come to get on to satisfactory terms with responsible and representative unions, such as had for long existed in British industries. Meanwhile, the atmosphere in Akron was unfavourable to peaceful work, and the policy of the rubber companies would be to develop their activities elsewhere.Hitherto, I have dealt almost entirely with economic matters. I shall conclude with a few more general observations.In a play which I saw in London some years ago, a young Foreign Office secretary finds himself by an accident, which does sometimes happen, at a full meeting of the Cabinet in No. 10 Downing Street. He is asked by the philosophical Prime Minister what he thinks is the most important thing in the world, and he replies without hesitation : &quot;Love and Anglo-American relations.&quot;I am glad to think that my department is popularly considered to have its fundamental policy so firmly based.Anglo-American concord will one day save the world, but that day has not yet arrived. There is still suspicion and hesitation on both sides. The American public is, however, much better instructed than it used to be regarding foreign affairs, and a wide interest is taken in events both in Europe and in the Far East. The rise of the dictatorships in Europe and of military power in Japan have had a profound effect. American opinion is almost unanimously opposed to what they consider to be a direct threat to Democracy. In the case of war in Europe, the feeling against Germany would be much more united than it was in 1914; the large and influential German community is mainly anti-Nazi; so are the peace parties and the religious bodies.The only major question at issue with Great Britain is the, alas! insoluble problem of the war debts.The complaint against British&apos; policy is that it is too weak. We have not championed the League as we should; we have not stood up against the dictators. Governor Lafollette said * to, me. that he feared the old spirit of enterprise and adventure was on the decline in England; we were afraid of taking risks. France, he thought, was drifting towards communism and civil war. The success of Franco he believed would seal the fate of France.I tried to show, him that the situation was neither quite so simple nor so gloomy. But I think these views are widely held. There is a large measure of sympathy for Great Britain; but our burden is regarded as too heavy for our old age and for our financial situation.
Sympathy is not enough to bring the United States to our assistance in case of war.   Isolationist forces and bitter memories of 1917 are much too strong.The most we could hope for would be a maximum degree of pacific benevolence, a favourable adjustment of the Neutrality Act, a lot of good advice, and possibly eventual participation as in 1917 if the war were prolonged.It is here that the attitude of Canada is of the greatest importance. I was only in Canada for a few days, and will not here embark upon a discussion of the Canadian situation. Suffice it to say, that the problems and the atmosphere are very different from those of the United States. But it struck me that Canada is either looking for or trying to avoid having a foreign policy. She is hesitating between imperial obligations and American abstentionism. She will continue to hesitate, until the moment that war breaks out; and then in the hour of political emotion she will decide. I hope and believe that she will decide to fight with us, but the decision is by no means certain.This decision will have an important influence on the attitude of the United States. For, if Canada abstains, why should the United States participate? It will also have an important bearing on the working of the Neutrality Act. In this connexion, the position of Detroit, centre of huge automobile and chemical works, situated right up against the Canadian frontier a neighbouring part of Canada lies to the south of Detroit is obviously of great significance.The foreign policy of Canada should be stabilised as a regulating factor between the United Kingdom and the United States. She is not greatly concerned with any other outside country; but upon these two, her whole future, economic and political, depends. If the British cause were defeated on the battlefields of Europe, the effect upon Canada, and probably upon the United States as well, would be disastrous.
