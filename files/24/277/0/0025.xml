(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S GOVERNMENT.)SECRET.Memorandum &quot;by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.At their meeting on the 25th May, 1938 (Cabinet 26(53) Conclusion 8), the Cabinet agreed to authorise the Chancellor of the Exchequer to prepare and submit to the Home Affairs Committee a Bill to enable the Trustees of the British Museum to accept the bequest of the late Lord Rothschild of his museum and collections at Tring.A draft of the necessary Bill is attached.      Its terms are confined to the acceptance of the bequest and do not, I think, call for comment.     It is desirable that the Bill should be available as soon as possible in order that any suitable opportunity of making progress with it may be taken, and as there is not a meeting of the Home Affairs Committee in the immediate future, I ask that the Cabinet should authorise the introduction of the Bill without reference to that Committee.The Bill is suitable for introduction in the House of Lords.CP. 144 (58).copy cabinet.Tring Museum.(Intd.)    J.S.Peasury Chambers, S.W. 1. 23rd June, 1938.
