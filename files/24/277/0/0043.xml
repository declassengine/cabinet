o i his DOCUMENT IS THE ,PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.Ci&apos;7l62( 38)CABINET DISCUSSIONS WITH AUSTRALIAN DELEGATION.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.I think that my colleagues may like to have the following account of the recent discussions with the Delegation from the Commonwealth of Australia.The Delegation came here&quot;&quot; at the initiative of the Commonwealth Government in order to discuss the possible revision of the United Kingdom - Australia Trade Agreement concluded at Ottawa in 1932.The advance indication which we received from the Commonwealth Government of the matters which the Delegation wished to discuss showed that these comprised:-(a) the maintenance of all   Australian privileges in the United Kingdom market (except those already given up to facilitate the trade negotiations with the United States) and the abandonment of the reserved right of the United Kingdom Government in certain circumstances to impose duties, levies or quantitative control upon importsof eggs, poultry, butter,  cheese and other milk products, i\i -and(b) the modification of some of the existing United Kingdom privileges in the Australian market, notably (i)      the Tariff Board clauses which provide, inter alia,that new or increased protective duties could not be imposed on United Kingdom goods without a
Tariff Board enquiry or to. an amount in excess of the recommendation of&quot;the Tariff Board, and that Tariff Board recommendations should he based on the principle that&apos; United Kingdom producers.should have full opportunity of reasonable competition on the basis of the relative cost of economical and. efficient production,  and (ii)  the agreed, formula for the grant of preferences to united Kingdom goods. 2.      This preliminary forecast involving,  as it did,  a considerable improvement in Australia&apos;s competitive position in the United Kingdom market and a serious deterioration in the competitive position of the United Kingdom, in the Australian market, did not offer a prospect of easy ne go t i at i 6 ns.3.     Before the departure of the Delegation, the Commonwealth Government were informed that we should be very pleased to begin trade negotiations with them on completion of our own negotiations with the United States, which at the time we hoped would be the end of May.      They arrived at the end of April, and as some of their officials.;, had made the journey across the Pacific and had called at Washington en route, the Delegation was able to realise that the United Kingdom - United States and Canada - United States negotiations had an important bearing upon their own projected negotiations with us.      Eventually it was agreed with them that in the circumstances their discussions with us should be of a preliminary and exploratory character.4.      In the initial stages of the discussions the Australian delegation took an even stronger line than that indicated in the preliminary message from the Commonwealth Government;    they pressed very vigorously that we should
guarantee to Australia an expanding&apos; share in our market not only for meat, (as to some extent was arranged at Ottawa) but for- all their primary products;    and that, where, necessary&quot; this should he arranged by-the imposition of further quantitative discrimination against the foreigner in addition to existing duty preferences.    They represented that such a guarantee was essential from the point of vie?/ of the development and defence of Australia, and in order to enable her to continue to pay interest on her loans and to absorb migrants from the United Kingdom.      Australia,  it was said,  could find no effective outlet for her primary produce outside the United Kingdom (except for wool and wheat)  and the delegation felt that any difficulties which might be experienced by the United Kingdom in curtailing the access of the foreigner to the United Kingdom market would be less severe than the difficulty of curtailing the development of Australia and submitting it to what Mr. Menzies described as &quot;virtual stultification&quot;.      I need not here go in detail into the difficulties which any such suggestion obviously involves;    I need only mention the fact that the other Dominions which send us similar produce could not be treated less favourably than Australia.      The difficulties were pointed out by us to the Commonwealth Delegation and the line taken was that the Ottawa A.agreements had already given a considerable advantage to Empire trade, that that trade had in fact greatly increased., and that we could not go further or faster in the same direction without endangering our great foreign export trade, which embraced commodities of great economic and political importance,  such as bituminous coal, with which no Dominion was able to assist us,e59      The Commonwealth Delegation also raised the question of the Tariff Board control of the Commonwealth tariff^ embodied in the Ottawa Agreement, and represented that public
opinion in Australia regarded this matter as a large invasion upon the Commonwealth&apos;s powers of self-government.     We pointed out that the Tariff Board had adopted an interpre-tation of the relative Articles of the Ottawa Agreement which was different from that which, the United Kingdom Government had contemplated;      the Commonwealth Delegation agreed that this was the position but observed that the Commonwealth Government had, in addition to the Ottawa concessions, made other efforts to develop United Kingdom trade and in parti-cular had made an uncoyenanted adjustment in their tariff on United Kingdom goods to meet the difference in exchange between United Kingdom and Australian currency.     They represented that the present interpretation of the Articles was in accord with Australian public sentiment and for the future they wished the recommendations of their Tariff Board to be advisory and not mandatory.6.      We continued the discussion on the basis that we had hoped at Ottawa that in return for the grant of free entry for Dominion goods in the United Kingdom, we should be able to obtain a schedule of maximum duties on United Kingdom goods in the Dominions but that in the case of Australia all that we had been able to obtain was the Tariff Board provisions of the Agreement.      We would welcome a schedule of maximum duties comparable with that already arranged in the case of the recent revision of the Canadian agreement, in place of the existing Tariff Board provisions.     For a considerable time, however, the Commonwealth Delegation took the view that this alternative was quite unacceptable;    it would make no allowance for cost factors,   such as wages and hours of work affecting manufacture in Australia, which were controlled there not by Parliament, but by the Arbitration Court.      Our
Our reply to this was that it was politically impossible for the United Kingdom to continue to grant complete security, based on free entry, for Australian goods unless there were adequate security for the treatment of United Kingdom goods in Australia which competed with local manufacturers, especially as industrial opinion here, in the light of a recent Parliamentary decision in Australia to vary a recommendation of the Tariff Board, had become very restive.7.      The above is a summary of the position as it  stood at  the end of last week,  though I should add that the discussions throughout were of a most friendly character. As a result of private&apos; conversations, however, with members of the Commonwealth Delegation,, I am glad to say that matters have now been advanced to a position where the Commonwealth Delegation realises the difficulties in the way of any alternative arrangement and have themselves proposed that the existing Ottawa Agreement should continue in operation for the time being.      There is accordingly now in preparation a joint statement drafted on a broad basis and couched in most friendly terms indicating how this conclusion arises from a review of the respective interests involved (which include other than purely commercial considerations) and the factors underlying the position.8.      It is hoped that this statement which is now in preparation will(l)    emphasise the importance of co-operation between the United Kingdom and Australia,(2)    recognise the need on the one hand for the progressive development of Australia and on the other hand for the full maintenance of United Kingdom export trade.(3)    contain an undertaking on the part of the Commonwealth Government to examine the possibility of granting us a suitable list of maximum duties.S.July 7,  1938. - 5 -
