(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&quot;S GOVERNMENT).COPY NO. fyOSECRET.CP.  NO.   149/38.CABINET. INDIA.Appreciation of the Political Situation, by the Government of India,  dated 20th June,  1938.Circulated for the information of the Cabinet by the Secretary of State for India.
Confidential appreciation of the Political situation in India, dated the 20th June, 1938, issued on the authority of the Secretary of State for India.Provincial Ministries.    Among Congress Ministries, that of the Central Provinces has achieved unenviable notoriety.    Sharif,  the Lav; Minister involved in the scandal mentioned in the last two appreciations, resigned his office on May 21st,  the report of a retired judge having condemned the clemency shown by him in the rape case.    But the other Ministers have been reassured as a result of somewhat intricate transactions.    The three who handed in their resignations withdrew them:    the Congress Working Committee then advised Dr. Khare, the Premier, to call a meeting of the party in his province to consider the situation and decide on the action required,    The meeting was summoned for May 24th.    Through the influence of Vallabhbhai Patel, a member of the working Committee with special powers of supervision over the ministerial affairs of this province, the necessity for a verdict was evaded by the issue of a statement that the ministers had amicably settled their differences and agreed to work in a spirit of comradeship.    Below this surface of restored placidity there is little solid ground.The Ministry has been branded as &quot;administratively inefficient&quot;, another instance of improper clemency has been revealed, and charges of nepotism have resulted in relatives and friends of Ministers divesting themselves of advantages they had obtained.    Though Congress is entitled to credit for instituting disciplinary measures against a Ministry which had betrayed its principles,  the outcome leaves in power Ministers who are discredited individually
3.i and unlikely to work harmoniously together.    Moslems have not failed to remark that the only Minister who has lost his place is the solitary Moslem.    The comment of Gandhi&apos;s mouthpiece in &quot;Harijan&quot; is that, though Congress in opposition has proved itself worthy of trust, Congress in power has yet to prove its worth, and in the Central Provinces it has been &quot;weighed and found wanting11.The enquiry into the Bilaspur election mentioned in the last appreciation is proceeding.    On May 25th the Enquiry Committee decided that the case against Mr. Raghvaendra Rao should be dropped as he could not be regarded as a Government servant and the terms of reference limited enquiry to allegations against Government servants. Proceedings against the remaining accused are being held in camera.In Bengal, Nausher Ali, the Minister for Local self-government, has made himself unpopular with his colleagues who suspect him of leanings towards the Congress opposition and his disappearance from the ministry appears likely. Further discussions have been in progress between Gandhi and. the Government about release of political prisoners;   but according to the press the Government proposals are not acceptable to Gandhi.The Madras Ministry has introduced compulsory Hindi in secondary schools.    There seems little enthusiasm locally for this article of the Congress creed and a militant campaign has been started against it.    The action talc en by Government to suppress opposition would have been condemned as ruthless in a bureaucratic administration:    among powers used are some conferred by &quot;repressive&quot; legislation the repeal of which it used to be the fashion to demand.
3.The United Provinces Government have published the report of an anti-corruption committee.    Though a number of provinces have taken steps to suppress corruption in the services (sometimes with the appearance of anti-official bias) this is the first, committee of its kind.    Some of its recommendations appear to give room for unfair-treatment of Government servants.In the Punjab a good deal of publicity has been given to a case in which one, Kiroo, caused the death of a police officer.    The defence was that he acted in self protection while being tortured.    The High Court,  in accepting this plea and acquitting him, expressed strong condemnation of the alleged abuse of   power.:    and the suggestion was made in an English newspaper that the Government were attempting to hush up a scandal.    Kiroo&apos;s supposed tormentors were placed on trial before a Divisional Commissioner who has discharged them on the ground that the prosecution evidence is worthless.2.        Provincial legislatures.    Both houses of Bihar legislature have been in session.    An amendment to the Prohibition Bill, passed by Council and accepted with slight alteration by the Assembly, exempts from the provisions of the Bill the use of wine for religious purposes - a concession to the Christian community.    An Agricultural Income Tax Bill has passed through both houses.    A bill to provide members with salary at Rs.75 per mensem and allowances has been passed by the Assembly.    Numerous amendments to a Money-lenders Bill made by Upper House have been accepted by the Lower.The Sind Assembly sat from May 16th to June 2nd.
Various Bills were passed on the lines of legislation in the Congress provinces,  including one fixing Ministers salaries at Es.500 a month with certain allowances, and another fixing members.&apos;  salaries at Rs.75 a month.    Other Bills abolished nominations to local bodies, and imposed a tax of four per cent,  on money nut into totalisators.    The Congress opposition demonstrated clearly that they hold the balance of power.The United Provinces Legislative Council sat from May 7th to 25th and returned no less than five out of eight Bills to the Assembly with substantial amendments. 3.      The Congress Party.    Although the decisions of the Premiers&apos; conference in Bombay, referred to in the last appreciation, have not been made public, it is understood that the Provincial Ministries have been given a free hand to deal effectively with communal trouble and to control communal tendencies in the press.    It is now doubtful y/hether any uniform decision was made about Parliamentary Secretaries and it appears probable that each Province will be allowed to follow its own line.    One resolution recommended the appointment of a committee of inter-Provincial co-operation and co-ordination to ensure uniformity of policy in industrial and agrarian matters.The conference is understood to have considered the rupee ratio.    The Government of India checked speculation by issuing a statement on 7th June to the effect that no change in the ratio is contemplated, as the present value is to be maintained in the best interests of the country.    This announcement elicited a retort from the Congress President that &quot;it is not for Government but for the people to dictate what the ratio should be&quot;:   but it is not yet clear that the
5.accepted policy of Congress is to demand a lower value for the rupee.The Working Committee sat in Bombay from 15th May to 19th and appears to have been mainly concerned With the domestic affairs of Congress Ministries, including that of the Central Provinces.&apos;   Congress factions in the Punjab led the &quot;forking Committee to depute one of their members to visit the Province.    He has patched up an agreement between the warring leaders and sections.Jawahar Lai Nehru has left India for a tour in Europe. It is believed that Congress wish to develop foreign connections in order to show, that, while Britain holds power, Congress commands the support of the people of India.    He is said to intend a round of European countries, including Russia, and has already visited Egypt and Spain. 4.        The Moslem League and Congress.    The communal unity talks were adjourned on May 15th to enable Mr. Jinnah to consult the Executive Council of the Moslem League, which was summoned to meet in Bombay on June 4th.    It is understood that, as a result. Congress has been asked to accept three propositions, all of which are calculated to be unpalatable. The Moslem League is to be acknowledged as the only organisation representing Moslems in India.    If this is accepted, further negotiations may take place between Committees representative of the League and Congress, but no Moslem shall be on the Congress Committee.    In any case, the League must ascertain the views of all the other minorities on terms that may be proposed, and will act on their behalf. Favourable consideration of these propositions will not have been assisted by a speech made by Mr. Jinnah on the day after the meeting of the League Council, in which he repeated
JL &quot;as6.his denunciation of Congress as a communal, masquerading in the guise of a national, organisation.    In no quarter is there any expectation of a settlement emerging from these unpromising beginnings.The preliminary correspondence between Jinnah and Jawahar Lai Nehru has been published - to the annoyance of Congress leaders who assert that this was done without authority.    The main interest of the letters lies In the contrast between the hectoring tone of Jinnah and the conciliatory attitude of Nehru.5.       Communal affairs.    In the  (Lahore) Shahidgunj case, the High Court has granted permission to the Moslems to appeal to the Privy Council and has ordered that no building shall be erected on Shahidgunj site till December 1939.    Both parties who were engaging in a civil disobedience movement have now abandoned it.The Madhe-Sahaba (Lucknow) dispute has been simmering but open trouble has been averted.The Government of Madras have adopted a novel device in settling a communal dispute between Hindus and Mahomedans at a place in that Province.    As a condition for withdrawal of cases arising out of a riot,  each community was required to fine itself Rs.2000/-,  and the money has been appropriated by the Government towards the cost of restoring order.6.        Labour.    On May 17th,  the last mill in Cawnpore closed down and about 42,000 workers were on strike.    The strike has now been in progress for more than 4 weeks,  and no signs of a settlement are visible.    There have been intermittent arrest of picketers.    Though SO per cent,  of the strikers have gone home to their villages,  the problem
7.of feeding the remainder is causing anxiety:    Congress and the Labour Union have started distributing free food, but their funds are- not likely to last long.    So far there has been no serious disorder but the danger of it does not lessen with the protraction of the deadlock.On June 12th the Provincial Government announced their decision on the Labour Enquiry Committee&apos; s Report.    They have accepted most of the recommendations and hold that the industry is able to bear the extra burden of increased wages;    they urge that their findings should be implemented. The employers have not yet replied.In the Madras Presidency,  the arbitrator&apos;s award in the Madura dispute has been accepted by both sides.    In three other disputes enquiries have been conducted.    In the Coimbatore dispute,  the finding has not found favour with the employers:    in the Choolai Mills (Madras) dispute the workers are dissatisfied with the finding.    The Madras Tramway and Electricity Supply Corporation have accepted a finding which was in favour of the workers.    Meanwhile, another strike involving 3,000 men has begun in the Vizagapatam District and continues.In the Central Provinces a Labour Enquiry Committee published its recommendations at the end of April.    These, and the Government&apos;s decisions thereon, have caused much dissatisfaction amongst Labour;    and the textile workers have decided to call a general strike for July 1st.In Bihar, there has been unrest amongst the workers in important iron and steel and similar industries, and this threatens to extend to the mines and collieries.    The difficulties in the relations of employers and employed are
increased by rivalry between two Labour leaders.    Additional police have been drafted to the affected area.    In Bengal, a strike has recentljr begun amongst the steel workers in Kulti.    In the Punjab,  about 1500 textile workers have struck for higher wages in Amritsar.Thus the restiveness of Labour is causing dislocation of industry in various parts of India, and in two or three Provinces the threat to public order is a cause for anxiety.7. Agrarian. . In Bengal the Tenancy Bill mentioned in the last appreciation has not yet received the assent of the authorities concerned.The Bill contains a clause bringing its provisions into effect from May 31st, by which date it v/as impossible for due consideration to be given to it and a decision made. In order to avoid complications that would have arisen if certain provisions were not enforced on the published date, the Governor, on the advice of his ministers, published an Ordinance early in June.    The effect of the Ordinance is that, if the Bill in due course becomes law, tenants will not be prejudiced in certain respects in the intervening period.    Its issue does not in any way affect the Question of assent to the Bill.    This is the first instance of an ordinance passed under the new Constitution.On May 14th/15th the All-India Kisan (Tenants) Conference was held at Comilla in Bengal.    The attendance was poor and the conference was a failure.    The President, Swami Sahajanand, who is a firebrand operating normally in Bihar, proclaimed the essential cleavage between the Congress and the Kisan movements.
In Bihar agrarian trouble is apprehended in the Gaya district.    Sahajanand (see above) while avoiding direct incitement to violence is accustoming his audiences to the idea that there will be violence.    The Kisan movement in Gaya is entirely in the hands of the left wing.There has been intensified Kisan agitation in Orissa, where it is said that the primitive peoples have been persuaded to join Congress on the understanding that membership will ensure relief from taxation.    The Tenancy Bill passed in this Province in February - which would drastically reduce rent paid by tenants in the permanently settled estates of the area transferred from the Madras Presidency - has been reserved for the consideration of the Governor-General.The land owners of the United Provinces are endeavouring to organise resistance to the Tenancy Bill, which is under consideration.    At a conference at the end of May attended by leading land owners of the Province, resolutions were passed condemning &quot;the total failure of the Government to protect the standing and lawful rights of the Zamindars11  (land owners) and announcing their intention of setting up a Zamindar volunteer corps,  to organise civil disobedience if necessary.    There are parts of the Province where bitter feelings between landlord and tenant have led to outbreaks of violence.The collection of land revenue in the Central Provinces is very slow.    In the North West Frontier Province, agitation against an Agriculturists Relief Bill is increasing with the support of some Congress members of the Legislature.8.        Miscellaneous.    The Federal Court has received its
*i i Ofirst case.    The Governor-General has referred to it the question whether the Central Provinces Motor Spirit Tax Bill is beyond the powers of the Provincial Legislature.    The first sitting was on May 31st.Members of the British and Indian cotton delegations met in Simla for trade.discussions in the third week of May. No agreement could be reached and the talks were abandoned on May 23rd.A case that has attracted attention is that of Prithvi Singh, a notorious revolutionary who began his career as a member of the Ghadr (Mutiny) conspiracy hatched in -America.    For his activities in India he was sentenced to death in 1915 but the sentence was commuted to transportation for life.    He. twice escaped from custody, the second time in 1922,  since when he has been at large, part of the time in Russia, for a while in jail in Afghanistan, and in India moving secretly in the underworld of communism.    He recently gave himself up to Gandhi in Bombay. Gandhi handed him over to the authorities but desires clemency for him on the ground that he has given up ideals of armed revolution.    The question of clemecy is primarily for the Punjab Government since the sentence above-mentioned was passed in that province.On June 8th a serious railway accident occurred in Bihar, resulting in the death of the driver and one other person and injuries to thirty or forty passengers.    There is reason to suspect sabotage.9.       Economic.    The  spring crop was on the whole satisfactory.    The monsoon has now begun and some parts of the country are affected by floods.    The afflicted parts of the Madras Presidency have received some rain.
10.      Waziristan.    Air action against Ma eld a Khel after due warning to the population to evacuate the areas concerned began on May 16th and has  since continued.    The tribe as yet show no signs of general submission.    Towards the end of May a large hostile force, which is estimated eventually to have reached a strength of over one thousand collected in Datta Khel Lowargi area at the instigation of the Faqir of Ipi.    On May 27th they burnt Khassadar posts between Boya and Datta Khel and subsequently appeared near Datta Khel Scouts post and engaged it with long range&apos;rifle and gun fire.    The guns used were two or three in number and were of tribal manufacture.No serious damage was done to the post or its occupants.    Prom June 2nd to June 6th regular troops operated against this tribal force from a base at Razani. Stiff opposition was encountered at first, but the tribal force eventually melted away and on June 6th the military&quot;   &quot;: a&apos;&apos;    Y-.      .:: Y &apos;; ^  7  &apos;   ; &quot;-a&apos; : ;;&apos;     &apos;&apos;- !.&apos;:  . &quot;&apos;:Y :   :   a&apos;1   &apos; Y       &apos;   /      v Y :&apos;: -; &apos; PC.v &apos; &apos; aa YYYa    YY;column proceeded from Mamirogha to Datta Khel and back without opposition.    The tribesmen are believed to have had 25 killed and a number severely wounded during the operations and their dispersal was due partly to this and partly to internal dissensions and lack of supplies.    About 200 hostile tribesmen are still collected in the hills&apos;&apos; &apos;&apos; Y &quot;a?;- YY- a:Y-: * aaa south west of Mamirogha and other members of the originalconcentration have formed small gangs in different partsof North Waziristan.    Our casualties during the operations were seven killed and thirty-four wounded.    The faqir of Ipis still in or on the border of Madda Khel.    The situationin the south of Waziristan has been generally quiet.    TheMahsud sections involved in the Dargai Sar incident havecomplied with Governments terms and air action against them has ceased.
