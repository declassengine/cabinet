1. I have to trouble my colleagues with a serious and urgent matter which threatens the possibility of financial, and political reactions.2. The building Societies are greatly perturbed by an.action which is now going on in the Chancery Court, where the decision is expected to go against them and thereby to throw the whole movement into considerable confusion. These Societies control some  700 millions of capital and are the main agency through which the great activity in private house building is being financed.      Since the Armistice more than 2,000,000 persons have obtained advances from the Societies for the purpose, of purchasing their houses.     The Societies have at present over two million shareholders, nearly one million depositors and 1-g- million borrowerso     The fortunes of the building industry and a vast body of employment are intimately bound up with the activities of the Societies.      If, therefore, serious doubts are suddenly raised as to the validity of the Societies&apos; methods in lending money to people who wish to buy their houses, and if the Judge grants an injunction against the Building Society now in litigation in terms which affect the methods of Building Societies generally, the result is likely to be both thatI C R E T. y wCOPY NO.     ^ / P. 141(58).CABINET. BUILDING SOCIETIES.Memorandum &quot;by the Chancellor of the Exchequer0
the carrying- cat of the housing programme will he held up also that depositors may lose faith in the safety of their deposits with the Building Societies, and demand a return of their deposits,,3. The point at issue is this.      Building Societies bythe terms of the Building Societies Acts may advance money on the security of freehold or leasehold, property.      The Acts do not say that the Societies may take collateral security.      But the widespread practice is for the builder of the house to put uo col lateral security..      The common arrangement    is that the Socic-rby advances 75 per cento  of the value of the house in accordance with its normal rules, and then an additional 15 per cento   on security furnished by the builder.      This security primarily takes the form of cash equal to 15 per cent,  of the value of the first 3 houses in any scheme and 5 per cent,   of the value of all subsequent houses,  and otherwise rests on the builder&apos;s guarantee,  so creating a sort of &quot;pool&quot;o       In this way the Building Society is prepared to advance more money than it would normally advance on the property alone,  and the purchaser can buy a house for an almost nominal first deposits      The indirect result may be that the price of the house is unduly raised, for the builder must cover himself against the possibility of any loss on the pool,  even if he does not also,   (as is to be feared happens in some oases) aVase the system by making too large a profit or by selling houses of unsatisfactory quality for a normal price.      The purchaser is misled by the extreme ease with which he finds the purchase price forthcoming.      The danger would be less if the valuer&apos;s certificate were always conservative? bvit there is reason to suspect that in many cases the valuation is excessive,
4.....      In the case now &quot;before the Courts the borrowed x (she is a woman,  stated to be a Cornraunist, who enjoys the advice of Sir Stafford Cripps) is claiming that the Building Society was acting ultra vires in taking collateral security, and * the Building Societies fear that the decision is going to be in favour of this enterprising litigant and against the Building Society movement. According to the advice I have received, the Judge will probably so decide, and the trouble may come to a head in a week or two.5. This is serious.     Such a decision would mean thatan immense number of operations by all the big Building Societies would be declared invalid;    doubts will be cast--on a vast number of transactions which have already taken place, and the directors of the Societies will certainly not be willing to continue a class of business which the Courts have held to be illegal;    we should have a sharp challenge in Parliament;    depositors may rush to get their money out (the statutory period of notice is not less than a month, but the practice is to pay on demand); and private house building will stop.6, If there is an adverse decision, legislation seemsto me inescapable.      It will be a difficult and trouble-some matter.      I do not myself see how it could possibly be introduced before the Judge gives his decision, though the Building Societies are demanding even that. 7i The position of the Building Societies is not altogether free from anxiety in another respect.     The housing boom has passed its peak and is slowly declining while the funds at the disposal of the Societies are well maintained and are even increasing as the result of heavy repayments of past loans..     The larger and sounder
Societies will no doubt find means of reducing their difficulties by further restriction on their intake of new capital&apos;, but there are possibilities that severe competition for a declining volume of new business may lead in a certain proportion of cases to the introduction of not too sound practices,,8. The Building Societies through a representativeCommittee have been in touch with the Registrar of Building Societies and have been insistent on the passage of a bill relieving them retrospec ti y ely from the results of any adverse decision of principle in the case before the Chancery Court0      In such event it appears that thejr would at the same time accept a strict definition of   collateral security which would apply in future cases though the exact terms have not been agreedc      But I very much doubt whether it would be easy or proper to secure the passage of a bill so limited in scope, more particularly if the case now before the Courts were made the occasion of severe animadversion from the Bencho      It is understood that roughljr 70 per cent, of the current business of the Societies is now carried on on the basis of these builders&apos; pools,,     However convenient that system may be it can be said, and no doubt will be said in Parliament? that the actual borrower is, in general, ignorant of the fact that the advance made to him by the Building Society is not related merely to the value of the property but is dependent also on collateral security put&apos;Up       the builder:    that the borrower may easily be misled by the apparent willingness of the Society to make so high an advance into believing that the xjurchase price of the house is a particularly reasonable one,&quot;    and that the system enables some builders to include a high element of profit in the purchase priceQ
* 9. I am convinced, therefore, that besides provisionsdefining &quot;collateral&quot;, the bill must include provision which will require the amount of the valuation, the name and qualification of the valuer, and the facts respecting any collateral taken to be disclosed to the borrower and to be available to the auditors of the Society.     Possibly we should also lay down -the maximum percentage of the valuation which may be made by way of advance when there is no collateral and when there is collateral respectively. 10.       If my colleagues agree, I propose to tell the representatives of the Building Societies immediately that it is impossible to legislate before the result of the Chancery Court case is announced and that the Government Bill must contain the safeguards mentioned. 11.       Unless, which I do not expect, the case is decided by the Court very rapidly, there will be an opportunity to submit the draft Bill to the Home Affairs Committee. Should however any sudden emergency arise, I would ask that authority may be given to a small body consisting of the Prime Minister, the Home Secretary, the Minister of Health, the Secretary for Scotland and myself to decide in that case on the course to be adopted.(Intld.)    J.S.ea sury, Chamberlain ers, S.W.1. 10th June, 1938.
