S E C R E T. Copy WoC A B I HE T.CP. 140(38).WORKMEN&apos;S COMPENSATION. Memorandum by the Home Secretary.1. I desire to raise for the consideration of my colleagues the question of the action to be taken by the Government in regard to workmen&apos;s compensation.      I am constantly being pressed in the House of Commons and elsewhere to introduce amending legislation and there is undoubtedly a strong and increasing feeling, which is not confined to representatives of Labour,  in favour of a revision of the Acts.2. The recent history of this matter is briefly as follows.In 1919 a Departmental Committee (the Holman Gregory Committee) was appointed to enquire into the whole subject and was specifically directed to consider whether it would be desirable to establish a system of accident assurance under the control or supervision of the State.      The Committee reported against any State system but proposed a number of important modifications of the existing system with a view to protecting the employer against excessive charges and the workman against risk of loss of compensation.      It recommended the establishment of compulsory insurance, State control of the rates of premium of insurance companies, and obligations on Mutual Indemnity Associations to set aside adequate reserves and furnish returns on the same footing as insurance companies.      It also advocated large increases in the rates of benefit, both in fatal and in disablement cases, and made proposals for securing to the injured workman the provision of various forms of special medical treatment at the cost of the employer.      It laid stress on the need for conciliation and mediation under the Act,  and recommended
that specific powers for the purpose should he given to the Registrars of County Courts.     At the same time it expressed the view that it would he. an advantage if the Act could be administered through local State officials.      Finally,  it recommended the appointment of an official in a Government Department to supervise the new arrangements,3. Many of the more important recommendations of theCommittee have not been adopted or only partly carried out, but various minor alterations and some improvement in the rates of benefit, particularly in fatal cases, were enacted in the Workmen&apos;s Compensation Act,  1923, and in the same year an agreement was arrived at between, the Home Office and the Accident Offices Association (comprising most of the big companies doing workmen&apos;s compensation insurance) whereby a certain percentage of the premium income (62-g-) must (broadly speaking) be allocated to the payment of compensation. Further,  insurance against workmen&apos;s  compensation risks has since been made compulsory by the Workmen&apos;s Compensation (Coal Mines) Act of 1934 for the coalmining industry.4, Since the Holman Gregory Committee there has been nofurther comprehensive enquiry, but -(l)    A Departmental Committee under Judge Stewart hasrecently reported on the medical arrangements in force under the Acts,  on the special problem of compensation for cases of miner&apos;s nystagmus, and on the working of the provisions as to lump sum agreements.      Its recommendations under the first two heads involve considerable amendments of the Acts. (2)    A Board of .Trade Committee under Sir Felix Cassel has reported on the working of the arrangements for
carrying on insurance business in connection with the compulsory insurance provisions applicable to motor car and aircraft insurance and. to workmen&apos;s compensation in the coalmining industry;  and has made various recommendations affecting?, chiefly (so far as workmen&apos;s compensation is concerned)  the conditions under which mutual associations carry on their &quot;business.      Its recommendations also involve important changes in the law. (3)    An Inter-Departmental Committee under Sir Malcolm Delevingne is enquiring into the arrangements at present in operation with a view to the restoration of the working capacity of workmen and other persons injured by accident,  especially in fracture cases. Its Report is expected in the course of this year. This enquiry covers not only the treatment of the injured workman in hospital but also the arrange-ments for any subsequent treatment necessary to his complete rehabilitation, and the Committee&apos;s findings may be expected to have an important bearing on workmen&apos;s compensation in various directions,  as for example in regard to the amount of compensation and as to the use of suitable light work as a method of treatment during convalescence.5. The Government promised as regards (l) and (3) thatwhen the Reports of these Committees were received they would consider as early as possible any recommendations which they might make for the amendment of the Acts and,  if they accepted those recommendations, would take steps with a view to introducing legislation to implement them,      As regards (2) they have promised to examine the question of compulsory insurance further in the light of the Committee&apos;s Report. No other pledges have so far been given.
-4- -    1556. During recent years Labour has pressed strongly forthe introduction of a State system of insurance and for a complete overhaul of the provisions of the Acts.      In 1928 a Joint Committee of the Trades Union Congress, the Labour Party, and the Parliamentary Labour Party,  issued a Bill for this purpose which proposed to substitute a State system for the present system based on personal liability of the employer and privately organised insurance and which involved a complete reconstruction both on the administrative and judicial sides. The Bill provided for a Compensation Board,  an Accident Insurance Fund,  and Local Committees and compensation officers for dealing with claims.      This Bill was introduced in the House of Commons in 1932 and (twice)  in 1936 but was on each occasion defeated on Second Reading.      At the end of last year the Labour Party promoted a Bill,  put forward as an instalment only, which omitted the State scheme and was limited to  compulsory insurance, increase of benefits and revision of medical procedure.      This Bill was also opposed by the Government on the ground that it went too far and that the subjects had not been properly investigated, and was defeated on Second Reading.7. Further,  the Labour Party have taken up and brought forward on three occasions a Bill originally introduced in 1934 by Mr.  (now Mr. Justice) Greaves-Lord&apos; for taking away the defence of common employment in common law actions.      This Bill was resisted and defeated on the broad ground that it would give rise to much litigation and expense and create further anomalies and that the proper method is to develop the remedy under the Workmen&apos;s Compensation Act rather than impose further burdens on industry through an extension of the common law.8. The chief points to which Labour has called attention in these Debates and in Deputations are as follows;-(a)    The need for an extension of compulsory insurance
to cover every trade and employment.(b) The need for the substitution of some State system under which claims to compensation would be determined in the first instance by State officers and would not be subject to any process of bargaining between the workman (or his representative) and the employer (or his representative).    They resent in particular the fact that they have to contest their claims very often vis-a-vis the agent of some profit-making insurance company wMch is concerned, they say,  to cut down the compensation as much as possible, and they contrast this procedure with the procedure in force under the unemployment Insurance Act.(c) The need for a drastic revision upwards of the rates of benefit, objection being taken most of all to the maximum limit of 30/- fixed in cases of disablement,     Hitherto the Workmen&apos;s Compensation Acts have aimed merely at affording the workmen substantial relief.      The claim of Labour, however, now is that the workman while incapacitated through industrial accident should not be in a worse position than when drawing wages .     In any case it is represented that the compensation should not be fixed at such a low rate that the workmen may be forced - as they often are at present - to have recourse to public assistance,  and their recovery retarded by financialwo rry.(d) The injustice of the present method of calculating the workman&apos;s earnings under which, they assert, undue account is taken of periods of unemployment and under-employment.(e) The need for greater obligations on the employer in the direction of finding work for the partially recovered workman.     Objection is strongly taken to any arrangement under which the workman is transferred from total to partial compensation the moment he is certified to be physically fit for light work.
(f)    The need for reducing what they term the vexatious and expensive litigation associated with the present compensation system.9. The complaints made by Labour on these points are insome respects undoubtedly extravagant, but there can be no doubt that there are many features in the Workmen&apos;s Compensation Acts which in the light of modern ideas and developments call for careful re-examination, and during the numerous debates which have taken place in the House of Commons in the last few years, it has been admitted on all sides that there is a case for review.      I had previously contemplated that it might be possible to make the necessary enquiries without appointing any further Committee or Commission and to introduce legislation in the next Or following Session of Parliament.      On further consideration, however,  I have come  to the conclusion that the questions at issue are of such magnitude and complexity that it will be practically impossible to frame any satisfactory legislation without the basis of some  comprehensive inquiry, and in the circumstances I suggest that the best course will be to appoint a Royal Commission on the subject.     We shall of course be accused of taking this step with a view simply to shelving the question for a considerable time to come but we shall be able to show that this course has been necessitated by the very sweeping and radical proposals for reform which Labour itself has put forward.10. I contemplate that the Royal Commission should begiven very wide terms of reference enabling it both to review the whole working of the present system and to consider proposals such as have been made by the Labour Party for the substitution of a State system and generally to overhaul the working of the Act;    and,  further, that the Commission should be charged with
10th June, 1938.the duty of considering the question of the modification of the employer1 s liability at- common law in relation to any developments proposed in workmen&apos;s compensation.11. Pending the results of this inquiry, which I imaginewould take something like two years to complete, further legislation would he postponed.      I should wish, however, to reserve the right to raise the question of a small Bill next Session to give effect to the recommendations of the Stewart Committee in relation to miner&apos;s nystagmus, which were agreed to by the representatives of the coal owners and the miners on the Committee.S.H.
