T. CP.   147(38)
(2)      The unanimous recognition &quot;by this representative Conference of Empire agriculturists of the need for orderly marketing of primary products in the United Kingdom and the recommendation that the necessary regulation of supplies should he effected by producers themselves, represent in my view a development of very great importance,  the significance of which in relation to agricultural policy in this country calls for careful consideration.(3)     My colleagues will be aware that supply  control on an international basis by organisations representing producers of the commodity concerned,  is becoming an important feature of world trade, not only in agriculture, but also in respect both of other primary products and of manufactured articles. Cartelisation of industry is,  in fact, one of the notable developments of modern times and the Government has already lent its support to this principle in a number of cases.      For example, the Government has actively participated in or facilitated the operation of the International Wheat Agreement,  the International Sugar Agreement and the international cartels covering rubber, steel and nitrogenous fertilisers, which aim at the control of supplies with a view to promoting price stability and the avoidance of depressing surpluses.      An Empire Fruits Council has for some years past regulated supplies of fruit from the Empire to the United Kingdom market and it is proposed to suggest to the United States Government,  in connection with the trade negotiations which are now taking place,  that they should encourage the co-operation of United States producers with this body.      In 1934 the Danish Government approached the Governments of Australia and New Zealand with a view to the introduction of a system of international
supply regulation in respect of butter but shortly afterwardsthere was a marked improvement in the butter market and theproposal was not proceeded with.(4)     But the most striking examples,  so far as agriculture is concerned,  are those which are specificallyreferred to in the Sydney resolutions, namely,  the Empire BeefCouncil and the International Beef Conference.      Theestablishment of these bodies for the purpose of regulatingsupplies of beef coming on to the United Kingdom market was an integral part of the policy outlined in the various white papers relating to meat issued by the Government during thelast four years and was regarded as an essential complementto the domestic livestock policy contained in the LivestockIndustry Act,  1957.      The statement on Livestock Policy made bythe Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries on July 6th, 1936,contained, the following:-&quot;The Government propose to proceed on the basis of a regulated market with the maximum supplies for the consumer consistent with a reasonable level of remuneration for the producer.It is the Government&apos;s desire that, at the earliest possible date, the responsibility for securing stable market conditions should be assumed by producers in the various countries concerned and exercised in the light of joint discussion of the problems involved.This discussion would be secured by the institution of an Empire keat Council,  representative of the United Kingdom and other Empire countries concerned, and an International iueat Conference, representative of the United Kingdom, other Empire countries and the foreign countries supplying substantial quantities of meat to this market.&quot;These bodies, whose establishment received only qualified support when it was first propounded,  have by common consent,  successfully uealt with a problem which had been causing serious and. continuous embarrassment to Governments,
(5) It would therefore, in my view, be fully in accord with our general agricultural and commercial policy to give encouragement to the principle of supply regulation through producers&apos;  commodity councils on an international basis-(6)      I would go further than that and say that the Sydney Resolutions, if full advantage is taken of them, provide us with an invaluable opportunity of bringing to a head and solving the problem of supply control for agricultural products. My colleagues will be well aware that it has become increasingly apparent that unless this problem is firmly handled, Empire agriculture is heading for serious trouble.   Policy in Australia, New Zealand and South Africa is based on expanding agricultural production.     In Canada a change from wheat growing in the prairie provinces to livestock production for the United Kingdom market is being advocated.    The eventual result must be glutted markets, collapsed prices and acute agricultural depression, not only in this c ountry but in overseas   producing countries themselves.     The need for calling a halt to the programme of expansion, and for introducing a-system of regulation, is beginning to be recognized by New Zealand and Australian political leaders but they dare not themselves take the initiative.     The Sydney Resolutions offer a means of dealing with the fundamental problem of production and have the further great advantage of removing day-to-day regulation from the political sphere.    (The reference in the 5th Resolution to the desirability of averting &quot;restrictive action under Statute by the U.K. Government&quot; will be noted).(7)     Although the main resolutions adopted by the Sydney Conference are in general terms, it would appear from the resolutions passed by various commodity committees
and subsequently endorsed by the Conference that the first commodity councils, that are likely to be set up would deal with mutton and lamb, pig-meats and dairy produce.      Other commodities mentioned in this connection during the proceedings of the Conference inclu.de wheat, fresh fruit (already covered as regards apples by the Empire Fruits Council), and eggs.      Owing to the number of countries involved it might prove difficult to initiate a commodity council for eggs and for the same reason butter would not prove easy of treatment.      A dairy produce council might, however,  function more readily in regard to cheese and processed milks.(8)     The need for encouraging action on the lines proposed is well illustrated by the present position with regard to mutton and lamb.      Exceptionally low prices for the home-produced article,  and the prospect of a further decline,  are causing serious concern,  and there is strong pressure,  in parliament and outside, for remedial action by the Government.      If the Government is not prepared to afford direct financial assistance to United Kingdom producers as in the case of fat cattle (and I do not recommend that course for sheep) the pressure for a reduction In imports becomes all the more intense,  and the full responsibility for securing a reduction rests on the Government.      My colleagues will be well aware of the political difficulties which arise whenever requests of this nature are made to the Governments of the Dominions,  and the advantages of a system under which this responsibility would, be assumed by the producers of the United Kingdom and of the chief supplying
countries sre obvious.      It was in fact originally proposed that the International Beef Conference andthe Empire Beef Council would be responsible for allclasses of meat end livestock except bacon and hams,but owing to the attitude of the New Zealand Government,it was ultimately decided to start this system ofsupply control with beef and fat cattle alone.      Thepolicy statement of July 6th, 1936, from which I havequoted above,  contained also the following:-&quot;As regards mutton and lamb, imports of Which are at present regulated in the case of foreign imports under statute, and in the case of Dominion imports by voluntary arrangements, the Gcv ernment propose to continue the present system for the -year 1937.      The question will fall for consideration in due course whether thereafter the International Meat &apos; Conference, in association with the Empire Meat Council, should operate in regard to exports of mutton and lamb to this market.&quot;(9)  - If, as I suggest, the Sydney Conferenceproposals are sound in principle, and in line with existing Government policy,  a clear indication of theGovernment&apos;s attitude towards them should in my view be given forthwith *      -Agri cultural producers inthis country feel, with justification, that theirrepresentatives at the Conference have achievednotable results in securing unanimous recognition ofthe need for orderly marketing and unanimous agreement on the means by which this should be achieved.      They,and the Empire producers overseas, are looking forsome encouragement from Governments as . an assurance that they are working on approved lines.      A lead fromthe United Kingdom Government at this stage will do agreat deal to facilitate the general acceptance &quot;byfarmers1  organisations throughout the Empire of theprinciples endorsed by their representatives at theConference and to encourage the necessary further developments.
(10) In this country a great deal of the agitation forGovernment intervention to save this or that branch of the agricultural industry&quot;from the consequences of unregulated marketing of home and imported produce should die down if the farmers&apos; leaders are encouraged to divert the energies of their followers towards these constructive plans for self-help.(11) The principle of a regulated market, with themaximum supplies for the consumer consistent with a reasonable level of remuneration for the producer? has already &quot;been accepted as the basis of Government policy in regard to meat and other commodities.      In considering an extension of this principle there are 3 I recognise, a number of important factors to be taken into account, in particulars the possible reactions on the interests of consumers and on the interests of foreign countries.      As regards the first of these, the orderly feeding of the market under such a system of regulation is in the interests, not only of producers, hut also of consumers since it prevents alternate gluts and shortages and the substantial fluctuations in prices that normally follow.      The fact that reta.il prices are usually more quickly responsive to a rising than a falling market imposes an additional hardship on the consumer under such conditions.      It cannot he said that existing examples of commodity councils, i.e., the International Beef Conference and the Empire Fruits Council, have operated to the detriment of consumers, and indeed, since each individual member of such a body inevitably presses for the admission of the maximum quantity which his country can supply? and since decisions to he effective must he unanimous, the bias will almost certainly he slightly towards over-supply rather than
under supply.      More ever? the interchangeability of many foodstuffs? and the great elasticity of demand which is a characteristic of some of them (notably &quot;butter) would deter any commodity council from attempting to hold the consumers to ransom.&apos;     As regards foreign countries? no statement should of course he made &quot;by the Government in this connection which would prejudice their position or create difficulties in the sphere of foreign policy and trade.      But a general statement of support for the principle of supply control &quot;by organisations constituted on the lines of the International Beef Conference (on which the interests of foreign suppliers are fully safe-guarded)  should not in my view cause any difficulties in this respect.      Judging by the experience of this Conference it should &quot;be possible for suitable arrangements to be made to look after.the interests of any small foreign supplier whose share in the trades although important to the country concerned might be such that direct representation on the Commodity Council would not he appropriate.      It wo Id also have to be made clear that in the event of the failure of a commodity council to reach agreement, as in the case of a breakdown of the International Beef Conference, the Government would he free to take such action as seemed expedient without being bound in any way &quot;by the deliberations of the council.(12) A public statement indicating the Government&apos;scordial approval of the policy of supply regulation Toy producers &apos; organisations,   (i.e.?  support.of the proposals in the fourth and fifth resolutions) although helpful, would not &quot;by itself secure
ZS2the desired results.      It has &quot;been recognised in the case of the International Beef Conference that it is necessary as a precautionary measure for the Government to have in reserve power to regulate the importation of livestock and meat &quot;by order?  &quot;if it appears to the Board (of Trade) that the making of the order is desirable in order to secure the stability of the market for livestock and meat in the United Kingdom.&quot; Appropriate reserve powers will be needed to provide an incentive for the unanimity which will be essential for the effective operation of other commodity councils; and for emergency use? at the discretion of the Government? in the event of threatened instability of the market? resulting from a &quot;breakdown.(13) It will he observed that the powers to regulateimports of livestock and meat? which are contained in Section 11 of the Livestock Industry Act? 1937? are sufficiently wide to enable the Government to regulate?  if necessary? imports of mutton and lamb or fresh pork.      In the case of milk products? it is possible that the ^provisions for quantitative regulation under Section 1 of the Agricultural Marketing Act? 1955 could he invoked? hut in any case the question of inserting suitable provisions in the long-term Milk Bill? now in preparation? is uncler consideration.      In the proposals with regard to the poultry industry which were approved by the Cabinet at their meeting on 29th June  (Cab.50(38), Concl.3)it is contemplated that power should be reserved to regulate imports of eggs for the purpose, inter alia? of ensuring stability in the market.
(14)    I have attached, as Appendix II to this memorandum a draft of the ,public statement which I suggest should he made.      This draft does not explicitly state that the necessary powers to regulate imports will T?e sought if they do not already exist.      Some such action ma;/, however, u&apos;- implied from the terms of the second paragraph of the statement.      Such -action would, it is submitted, be in line with the present trend of Government  policy.      Such a statement would moreover strengthen the hands of Dominion Ministers wno recognise that regulation of supply is becoming inevitable but do not feel able, without some good excuse, to tell their producers that the doctrine of unrestricted expansion,s which they have been preaching in the past,  needs some revision in the light of present-day c o nd i t i oas.(15)    It is desirable, also, I suggest,  that an indication of the Governments active interest in theSydney resolutions should be conveyed to DominionGovernments,  especially in view of the fact that legislation will be necessary in some Dominions to enable producers&apos;organisations to control supplies sent to the United kingdom market,      It is relevant to note in this connection that Mr.Lyons,  in a statement to the Press at the conclusion of theConference, said:-&quot;The Government would consider most carefully the decisions of the Empire Producers&apos;  Conference regarding the regulation of supplies to British markets.      I am pleased that such a representative Empire body has found it possible to arrive at definite recommendations on this very difficult and complex question.     As a large producing country we have to face the fact that the United Kingdom, which is our best overseas market, has its limits.      If there must be regulation of supplies in the interests of Dominion producers,  it is obviously better that it should be done voluntarily by the producers themselves through thei*&apos; representative organisations than by official action in Britain, Hence the Commonwealth regards as most important the recommendation for the establishment of commodity councils to act in co-operation with
one another.      Important, also, is the recognition that the councils, in conjunction with Empire governments, should co-operate in action to extend the scope of markets outside the Empire for the absorption of surpluses. This extension is bound up with the trade talks which will occupy the attention of the Ministerial delegation now on its way abroad.&quot;It should also oe borne in mind that action has alreadybeen taken oy certain of the Dominion Governments in orderto enable the recommendations of the Empire Fruits council with regard to the supply of apples and pears to theUnited Kingdom market to be implemented.     As stated above in Paragraph (8) of this memorandum the New zealand government at  the time of the establishment of the EmpireBeef Council and the International g.eef Conferencedemurred to the proposal that those bodies should alsodeal with mutton and lanvo supplies, but it is a significartfact, of which no douot due notice will be taicen by theNew Zealand Government, that the Sydney resolutions were proposed by the representative of the New Zealand Farmers&apos;Union,(15)    I suggest,  therefore, that communications (the terms of which will no doubt have to be raried, having regard to the special interests of each Dominion and the known attitude of its Government towards these problems) should be addressed to the Governments of the Dominions intimating that His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom would regard the estaolishment of further commodity councils, as proposed in the Sydney resolutions, as a very important and desirable development of Imperial agricultural policy and one which would appear to be in the cost interests of the promotion of international trade, bearing in mind that the first resolution recognised the Ottawa &quot;order of preference,&quot;       The Dominion Governments might be invited to give their
sympathetic support to any such development and as a first step to consent to the inclusion of mutton and lamb in the purview of the Empire Beef Council and the International Beef Conference.    The hope might also he expressed that Dominion Governments would, if necessary,  invite their Parliaments to pass enabling legislation authorising them to facilitate action recommended by any such commodity councils as might be established for controlling the orderly export of supplies from their respective countries.    The terms of these communi-cations could, if the proposal is generally approved by my colleagues, be agreed between the Ministers concerned. (17)   Briefly, my proposals are that -(i)    I should be authorised to make an early announcement on the lines of the dre.ft in Appendix II to the following effects-    The Government is in general agreement with the views of the Sydney Conference of British Empire producers that a system which will ensure the orderly marketing of Empire primary products is necessary in order to maintain continuity of supplies and to prevent avoidable gluts and resultant instability of price levels and speculation. The Government would prefer that the responsibility for securing stable conditions in the United Kingdom market should be assumed by producers in the various countries concerned and exercised in the light of joint discussion of the problems involved, and therefore cordially welcomes the proposal that Empire producers&apos;   organisations should co-operate to establish such commodits&apos;&apos; councils as may be deemed necessary, producer controlled and financed, the representation thereon being on the lines of the Empire Beef Council and International Beef Conference.
(ii) communications should be - sent;, to- -the Governments of the Dominions-indicating the importance which the United Kingdom Government attaches to the . resolutions adoioted by the Empire Producers&apos; Conference and inviting them to give sympathetic consideration to, and to take any necessary steps to facilitate, the proposal to establish further commodity councils for supply regulation;    and as a first step to consent to the inclusion of mutton and lamb in the purview of the Empire Beef Council and the International Beef Conference,(18) The Secretary of State for Scotland is in. full agreement with the views expressed and the recommendations made in this Memorandum.W.S.M.Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, 1st July,  1938c
APPENDIX I. RESOLUTIONS. ADOPTED___3Y___TEE--CON^SRENCE.On the motion of Mr. W. W. Mulhol.1and (New Zealand). Seconded by Mr. M. P. Duniop, M.L.C.  (Australia).1.     That this Conference accepts the Ottawa &quot;order of preference&quot;, i.e. that the local producer is entitled to first place in nis local market;    other Empire producers second place, and foreign producers third.2.    That this Conference accepts the need for securing the expansion of Dominion supplies of primary products to the United Kingdom market so far as is economically possible.3.    That this Conference accepts the need for orderly marketing of Empire primary products in order to maintain continuity of supplies and to  prevent avoidable gluts and resultant instability of price levels and speculation.4.    Accordingly, this Conference recommends that Empire producers&apos;  organisations shall co-operate to establish such commodity councils as may be deemed necessary, producer controlled and financed, the representation thereon being on the lines of the Empire oeef Council and International Beef Conference set up under the (United Kingdom) Livestock Industry Act,  1957, and the decisions of which to be effective shall Ibe unanimous .5.    That it should be the duty of such councils where established to assist in,  and advise their constituent organisations with reference to,  such regulation of the flow of supplies of primary products to the United xiingdom market as may be necessary, for example, to avert restrictive action under statute by the United Kingdom Government,  it  being understood that for purposes of the regulation of supplies full use shall be made of all existing producers&apos;  export organisations in the
Dominions.60    That this Conference recommends that each and every commodity council, as and when established,  shall take all necessary steps to institute a continuing survey of conditions affecting available supplies and markets in Imperial and foreign countries and, in consultation with Empire Ministers, shall take the necessary action to secure the expansion of existing,  and the creation of new, ma neets with the object of the aosorption of Empire surpluses,,
APPENDIX IT Draft StatementHis Majesty&apos;s Government have noted with great interest and have given careful consideration to the Resolutions which were unanimously adopted at the recent British Empire Producers&apos;  Conference held in Sydney, H.S.W.3 in connection with Australia&apos;s 150th anniversary celebrations,, The Conference was organised &quot;by associations of primary producers in various countries within the British Commonwealth of Nations and was attended by delegates from those bodies. While the Conference was, stherefore,  in no sense an official gathering, H.M. Government are impressed by the evident desire of the spokesmen of the farmers&apos;   associations to play their part in the development of marketing organisations on a voluntary basis by the institution of commodity councils on the lines of the Empire Beef Council and the International Beef Conference with a view to the better regulation of the flow of supplies of primary products to the United Kingdom market in the interests of producers and of the consuming public, and the development where possible of foreign markets for Empire surpluses of stich produce.The Government is in general agreement with the view expressed by the Conference that a.system which will ensure the orderly marketing of Empire primary products is necessary in order to maintain continuity of supplies and to prevent avoidable gluts and resultant instability of price levels and speculation.      The Government would prefer that the responsibility for securing stable conditions in the United Kingdom market should be assumed by producers in the various countries concerned and exercised in the light of joint discussion of the problems involved.      The Government,  therefore,
cordially welcomes the proposal that Empire producers&apos; organisations should co-operate to establish such commodity councils as may be deemed necessary, producer-controlled and financed,  the representation thereon being on the lines of the Empire Beef Council -and International Beef Conference, and the decisions of which to be effective shall he unanimous.It is understood that the recommendations of the British Empire Producers&apos; Conference are now engaging the consideration of the farmers&apos; organisations in Empire countries and in the meantime the Government propose to coninunicate with H.M. Governments in the Dominions concerned for the purpose of ascertaining their views on the proposals and on the question of taking any action which may be necessary to facilitate, with due regard to the interests of consumers in this country,  the smooth operation of the commodity council system in the event af Empire farmers&apos;  organisations deciding to endorse the recommendations of the Conference.
