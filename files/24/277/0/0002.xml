2 2(THIS DOCUMENT IS TEE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNIiSNT).SECRE&apos;?copy NO.CP. 121 (58).CABINET.&apos; PORT OP LONDON AUTHORITY.       PETROL STORAGE AT PURFLEET.Memorandum by the Minister of Transport.Since December,  1936,  the C.I.D,   (Minutes of 285th meeting) has had under consideration the proposals of the Anglo-American Oil Company to transfer storage accommodation for some 100,000 tons of petrol from Thames Haven (34 miles from London Bridge and 8 miles from Tilbury) to Purfleet (19 miles from London Bridge), conditional!;/&quot; upon the byelaws of the P.L.A. being amended to allow ocean tankers to proceed to Purfleet instead of the present limit at Mucking (31 miles from London Bridge).My predecessor pointed out at the time that a proposal for a somewhat similar amendment of the Port of London Authority Byelaws had been submitted to the Minister of Transport in 1927. A Public Inquiry, lasting 27 days5 was held in 1927 on the Minister&apos;s behalf by the Chief Inspector of Explosives of the Home Office and by the Home Office Adviser on Petroleum Questions, who reported in 1928 as follows:-&quot;the conclusion that the presence of petroleum spirit tank ships in the reaches westward of the Mucking Light, with the operations incidental to the berthing of the ships and the discharge or loading of their cargoes,  does introduce a new .risk of some magnitude ....  it is not necessary to draw a more exaggerated picture in order to hold that a disaster by fire in connection with a large tank ship would be of a most calamitous nature&quot;. They reported that the promoters had not established that existing conditions so hampered trade as to warrant alteration of the limit with the attendant risks.
The Minister of Transport, under the powers conferred upon him by Section J of the Petroleum (Consolidation) Act, 1928, refused to confirm the byelaws.The present proposals of the Anglo-American Company commended themselves strongly to the CJ.D. as affording without direct cost to the State an opportunity of obtaining tankage of satisfactory &quot;protective&quot; construction, away from the large concentration at Thames Haven and in a position which would secure the existence of a reserve in the event of successful hostile attack upon Thames Haven, or upon the reaches of the river &quot;between Thames Haven and Purfleet.The Commissioners who had held the Inquiry were consulted by the Home Office in regard to the new proposals and replied in   March, 1937s&quot;&quot;&quot;Whilst undoubtedly the greater risks of taking such ships up to Purfleet are in no way modified ... the facts put before us in connection with national defence override other considerations and in oar opinion such risks should be accepted&quot;.Lengthy interdepartmental discussions ensued and in October and November, 1937&apos; conferences were held with representatives of shipping interests, insurance interests and local authorities at which the paramount requirements of national defence were strongly emphasised and were indeed generally recognised   by those interests who would otherwise have strongly opposed the amendment of the byelaws.In December, 1937* &quot;the General Manager of the P.L.A. informed the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence that the Authority was being moved to take the necessary steps to amend the byelaws.In a letter of 23rd December, 1937* ^e Board of Trade intimated that their discussions with the shipping interests-, the barge interests and the insurance interests strengthened their previous opinion that the risks involved in the present proposal were Very great, although they would not wish to question the
overriding necessity of ensuring supplies in war time.The following is an extract from that letter:-&quot;The President feels obliged to put on record his opinion that the proposal involves grave risks in peace time and that should a serious accident occur the Government&apos;would be severely criticised for having allowed, and in fact encouraged, the proposal.&quot;The question was again mentioned by the G.I.D. at their 316th meeting on the 31st March, 1938, when the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence observed that since ten years ago -&quot;circumstances had altered a good deal and though certain additional risks would be entailed if the byelaw was altered,  the advantages of the Anglo-American Company&apos;s scheme, which depended upon the amendment of the byelaw, justified the acceptance of these risks.      As a result of a good deal of negotiation with local authorities and other interests, the proposed amendment had now been published and it was hoped that it would be confirmed in about three weeks time&quot;.The Port of London Authority, after considering the objections lodged against the proposal, decided on the 12th May, 1938, to appljr to me for confirmation of the byelaws.      At the same time the London shipping interests and the insurance interests have renewed their representations to me.      The shipping interests have expressed strongly their dissatisfaction that they had nothing more than the ipse dixit of the Government spokesman that the scheme was necessary on overriding Defence grounds, without any evidence -(a)    that Purfleet as a site,  and irrespective of the offer made by the Anglo-American Company, would provide abetter solution than any other site for the problem ofspreading the risk;    and
(d)      that if Purfleet were so selected, there was some reason, other than expense, for preferring a relaxation of the byelaws to the construction of a pipe line.The Fire Offices Committee have placed &quot;formally on record their opinion that the transport (to Purfleet) of low flash point petroleum in ocean-going tank ships will involve serious increase in the fire hazard in relation to wharves, quays and other riverside proi-ierty&quot;.As Minister of Transport charged with the responsibility for satisfying myself that the byelaws of the P.L.A. provide a reasonable measure of safety for the users of the river, I find it no less difficult than did my predecessor to assent to a proposal involving the &quot;by no means remote possibility in peace time of having the whole river from Erith to Gravesend covered with a highly inflammable film of petrol washed backwards and forwards &quot;by the tide.      I need not emphasise the special dangers of berthing movements and unloading at Purfleet, where the narrowness of the river has been an important factor in the selection of the site for the new Dartford - Purfleet Tunnel.The figure of  250,000 has been suggested as the probable capital cost of the construction of a pipe line from Thames Haven to Purfleet:      but even if the State were to provide the pipe line the cost of pumping from Thames Haven to Purfleet would probably be so much heavier than the cost of transport in ocean tankers as to make the Purfleet scheme no longer an attractive business proposition to the Anglo-American Oil Company.Shipping interests appear to me, however;, to he justified in asking whether, if Purfleet be selected, there is any reason other than expense for preferring relaxation of the byelaws to the construction of a pipe line.      It may be observed -that, if a pipe line were used for normal peace operation but
were damaged bjr enemy action, it would still &quot;be possible, in war time, by immediate exercise of Defence powers, to relax the prohibition upon the movement of ocean tankers beyond Mucking,I cannot forecast the additional burden, &quot;by way of increased fire insurance charges, which will be thrown upon shipping interests and riparian owners,  and while the P.L0A0 .. and other interests will doubtless take all practicable precautions, there must remain a fire risk of the first magnitude and I feel it incumbent upon me to bring this fact prominently to the notice of my colleagues.      I have no reason to think that the fire risk is overstated.I am prepared in present circumstances to ride rough-shod over the opposition of vested interests of trade competitors and of a limited number of property owners, shopkeepers and labour at Thames Haven or Purfleet.      I find it far more difficult to contemplate setting aside the weighty representations of the shipping and insurance interests without at least giving them the opportunity to be heard at an Inquiry in camera, and if need be to criticise, the Defence considerations which have led the Co I.Do  to require the acceptance of these grave risks in peace time, risks which will be the greater if the other oil companies avail themselves of relaxed by-laws.My colleagues will appreciate that this matter is bound to give rise to acute controversy.      If notwithstanding my doubt, which I believe to be fully shared by the President of the Board of Trade, my colleagues are satisfied that the national defence aspect of this question overrides all other considerations, I am prepared to confirm the &quot;byelaws on. the clear understanding that this is a decision of HeM.  Government on grounds of defence and not that of an individual Minister.(Intd.) E.L.B.MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT. 20th Mav. 1958.
