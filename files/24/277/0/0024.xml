Printed for the Cabinet.   June 1938.SECRET. Copy No.     ^ cp. 143 (38).CABINET.AIR MISSION TO UNITED STATES AND CANADA: CREATION OF A WAR POTENTIAL FOR AIRCRAFT PRODUCTION IN CANADA.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air.AT their meeting on the 25th May the Cabinet agreed to delegate authority to take a decision on the purchase of aircraft from the U.S.A. to the Prime Minister, Chancellor of the Exchequer, and the Secretary of State for Air. As a result of discussion it has been agreed to place orders in America for the delivery of 200 Lockheed general reconnaissance and 200 North American trainer aircraft.So far as Canada was concerned, the Mission&apos;s enquiries were directed not to the meeting of immediate requirements, which it was known would be impossible in the present undeveloped state of the Canadian industry, but to the possibility of building up on the foundation of that industry as at present existing, a potential which could in case of war be relied upon to supplement United Kingdom production.Throughout their visit to Canada the Mission enjoyed the ready co-operation of the Defence Department and they were supplied by the Canadian Defence authorities with comprehensive data which had been prepared on the capacity of the Canadian firms; but it became clear at the outset that it would be necessary for the Mission to conduct enquiries on the basis that the United Kingdom Government was seeking to explore the practicability of arranging with the Canadian industry for the creation of a war potential, and that the Canadian Government were particularly anxious to prevent the impression that they were themselves directly concerned with the matter. The Canadian Government were, however, anxious that our activities should be in parallel with their own plans for the development of an aircraft industry in Canada.It became clear in the course of discussion that the establishment of shadow factories would be opposed by the Canadian Defence Department. Moreover, the Mission reached the conclusion that the establishment in Canada of such factories, which would for the most part have to be placed &quot; in vaseline &quot; in peace time, would not afford the necessary guarantee of the availability of labour and materials which would be required to meet the demands which would be made in the event of war. It was also clear that the Defence Department would oppose any scheme which would entrust the development of the necessary potential to one or two of the ten firms which are at present engaged on the manufacture of aircraft in Canada. The Defence Department feared the hostilities and suspicions latent in such a method and also the detrimental effect of an arbitrary selection of this kind on a young and growing industry.The Mission, in consequence, reached the conclusion that the only sound method of producing an adequate war potential in Canada was to develop the existing Canadian aircraft industry as a whole on health)&apos; and natural lines by the stimulus of orders from the United Kingdom. This was also the considered view of the Canadian Defence authorities.

This was also the considered view of the Canadian Defence authorities.
The existing Canadian industry is at present quite immature, and its resources are slender. No one firm is big enough to undertake, with its own resources, the manufacture of the large bombers, which it has always been recognised that it would be particularly valuable to produce in Canada, while even the manufacture of smaller types under licence would be likely to strain the individual capacity of firms if undertaken in any considerable quantities. The Canadian companies have no design and development and organisation as we know it in this country, and this is only likely to emerge when the basic structure of the industry has been expanded to a point where such an organisation would be financially justified. This postulates the creation of a productive capacity which, in the absence of action from the United Kingdom, appears likely to be a lengthy matter. The essential object, therefore, to be secured at the present time is the pooling of resources by co-operation betAveen the Canadian and United Kingdom industries and between the various members of the Canadian industry themselves.The Mission made it clear during their stay in Canada that the)&quot; were concerned at the present stage with the exploration of principles, leaving questions of their application in detail to be pursued later. They did not, therefore, make even preliminary visits to the factories of the aircraft companies in Canada, nor did they make any attempt to work out detailed proposals on the spot. From the enquiries made by the Mission, however, and their discussions on the one hand with the Canadian Defence Department and on the other with industrialists, the conclusion emerges that the main hope is likely to lie in the following directions :  (a) The encouragement of &quot; marriages &quot; of individual Canadian firms with United Kingdom &quot; partners &quot; with a view to the manufacture under licence in Canada of an allocated proportion of orders for specified types of aircraft (other than the large bomber class) placed by the Air Ministry with the British firms, the United Kingdom Government ensuring that a reasonable allocation is made in each instance by the United Kingdom firm concerned, so far as might be warranted by the value of the potential so brought into being.(6) For the large bomber class special arrangements would be necessary since quantity production will entail creation of capacity beyond the powers of individual firms. The most promising solution appears to be some sort of Group scheme embracing all the recognised aircraft firms in Canada. The lines upon which such a scheme could best be developed can only be tentatively suggested at this stage; but, following on general discussions between the Mission and the leading Canadian firms on the possibilities of a Group scheme, it is thought that a suitable arrangement would be as stated in (c) and (cl) below.(c) A central assembly factory is visualised, owned, operated and financed bya joint company standing in contractual relationship with the United Kingdom Government and backed by the Banks and other financial and commercial interests with the support of other competent organisations for the supply of raw materials. The Company would supervise the scheme, have firm powers of control over the firms in the Group, and, through its General Manager (who the industry appreciates would require to be a man of experience appointed from this country), would allocate to each firm certain component airframe parts for manufacture. Each individual firm would finance its own production (including the development of individual types under (a) above) and contribute a quota of financial support to the central Company.(d) The United Kingdom Government would place an initial order with this organisation which would be sufficient to bring into existence a nucleus capacity. The size of this order would, of course, require consideration in the light of further examination, but it might be of the order of 100 large bomber aircraft of the B. 12/36 type (which is the largest type due to go into production in the early future) for delivery starting in (say) two years&apos; time and extending over a period of two years. It would not be practicable at this stage to indicate definitively the financial arrangements which would be necessary, but, on the information available, it might be anticipated that the cost of
the aircraft ordered would be in the neighbourhood of 25 per cent, to 33^ per cent, higher than if the order were placed in the United Kingdom. The total cost would be in the neighbourhood of  3,500,000, but the order should be the means of bringing into being a capacity capable of expansion in war to produce about 500 large bomber aircraft per annum, with a prospect of further development by supplementary arrangements as and when warranted. Such aircraft would be capable of delivery by air to the United Kingdom. (e) Such a plan would have the enthusiastic support of the Canadian Defence Department. The ten firms comprising the Canadian aircraft industry have also intimated that they would be prepared to adhere whole-heartedly to such a co-operative scheme, and have asked for the assistance of experts from this country in working out its details. This offer of co-operation within the Canadian aircraft industry was as unexpected as it was welcome to the Canadian Defence Department.I am of the opinion that the creation of a war potential in Canada on these lines is a matter of vital importance and pressing urgency. I should, therefore, propose to send immediately a special Mission to Canada for the purpose of negotiating ad referendum a considered scheme, after close local investigations and discussions with all parties concerned, including the responsible financial and commercial interests whose backing is essential to the success of such a plan. The arrangements would include provision for some such safeguarding oversight of the functioning of the scheme as was shown to be necessary by the Avorking of the Canadian Munitions Board during the Great War. The Mission would only negotiate the scheme as one for manufacture of airframes and the supply of necessary materials. They would, however, explore on a tentative basis the possibilities for the development of the manufacture in Canada of aero-engine and allied items necessary for the complete aircraft. Pending such a develop-ment, supplies of these items would be made available from United Kingdom sources.In asking the approval of my colleagues to the despatch of the proposed Mission, I should observe that, although their discussions would be ad referendum, it would be extremely difficult to refuse endorsement of a satisfactory scheme so negotiated unless international problems change appreciably in the interval. The departure of such a Mission would no doubt be tantamount to a moral commitment to the principle of creating a potential in Canada, and any subsequent with-drawal might be damaging to the prestige of this country. Its despatch would, I think, undoubtedly have a considerable and immediate effect on the present situation apart altogether from the value of such a potential as before described.K. W.Air Ministry, June 16, 1938.
