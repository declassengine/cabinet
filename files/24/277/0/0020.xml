CP .139(38)confidnetial cabinet,COPY NO.EXTENSION 0? THE MILK ACTS,  1934-37,MEMOILhNDUM 1 BYTHE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE ANDFISHERIES AND THE SECRETARY OFSTATE FOR SCOTLAND.1.      On 28th July,  1937,  the Cabinet gave authority for the issue of a iVhite Paper (Cmd.5533) on the Government&apos;s milk policy (Cab. 32 (37), 10th Conclusion).    This White Paper contained proposals for the establishment of a permanent, independent Milk Commission to keep milk industry matters under review and to advise and assist Ministers as well as the industry,  for Exchequer contributions on a diminishing scale over a period of five years towards the cost of loremiums on quality milk to be paid by the Milk Marketing Boards,  and for the continuation in a mod.ified form of Exchequer assistance in respect of milk going into manufacture. Proposals with regard to pasteurisation were also outlined and an announcement made of the Government&apos;s intention to include in the forthcoming legislation provisions to facilitate the improved organisation of the distributive service, to continue the scheme for the provision of cheap mil1-&apos;: for school-children and to enable a reduction to be made in the price of liquid milk to local authorities for the purpose of their maternity and child welfare arrangements.    The White Paper stated that legislation to give effect to the Government1s proposals would be introduced as early as practicable in the present Session.2. The preparation and drafting of the legislation has, however, taken longer than was anticipated owing to the complexity and difficulty of the subject matter, and to the necessity for consulting and negotiating with the various organisations, including local authorities, who will be affected by the White Paper proposals. Considerable progress has been made with the drafting of the Bill, hut there are several questions on which the decisions of Ministers will be required before a final
draft can be prepared for consideration &quot;by the Home Affairs Committee.      Some Parts of the Bill, particularly those dealing with pasteurisation and. distribution,  are likely to be controversial and are bound to give rise to considerable discussion when the Bill comes before Parliament, and it became apparent some weeks ago, after consultation with the Chief Whip,  that it will not be possible to find the necessary time for the passage of the Bill through parliament this Session.3.    - It therefore becomes a question for consideration whether the Bill should be introduced before the Summer Recess, and proceeded with next Session,  or whether the introduction should be deferred until the autumn.      We have come to the conclusion,  in consultation with the Minister of Health, that the second course is to be preferred as allowing more time for the Bill to be prepared for publication.     Moreover there seems to be no advantage in putting controversial proposals before critics in parliament and outside some four or five months before they can be explained and defended on the floor of the House.4.      We do not propose to refer in this memorandum to the issues requiring Ministerial decision,  since if the procedure recommended, in paragraph 3 above is approved,  these questions can more approoriately and conveniently be considered by the Agricultural Policy Committee,  to whom separate memoranda will be submitted.5.      In the meantime, however, the chief provisions of the Milk Acts 1934-37 will expire at the end of next September and we feel that it is essential that the gap before the long-term legislation comes into operation should be bridged by the extension for a further twelve months of the provisions of those Acts for Exchequer payments (subject to certain conditions) on milk used for manufacture in Great Britain and Exchequer grants towards the cost of the operation of the Milk-in-Schools Scheme.     We accordingly seek the concurrence of our colleagues to the preparation of a Bill for this purpose.2.
6. After consultation with the Treasury we seek discretion to make provision if necessary in the Bill for the extension by one year of the period during which under- existing legislation payments may be made from the Exchequer to the Government .of Northern Ireland in respect of milk used in Northern Ireland, for manufacture.      It is not proposed    that any part of the long term legislation? except such provision as may be made for the regulation of imports, should apply to Northern Ireland, and the Government of Northern Ireland have made arrangements to meet from their own Exchequer the cost of assistance to their Milk Industry as from 1st October next, the date on which it was expected that our long term legislation would become effective.      We shall, however, now no doubt he met with a claim;, which it may be difficult to contest,   that since our long term legislation is being delayed, the existing provision for payments to the Government of Northern Ireland should in the meantime be continued.7.      Apart from a straight-forward extension for a further twelve months of the existing temporary provisions there are two matters arising out of statements in the White Paper of July last which we think justify in the one case specific provision in the extending Bill and in the other an increase   in the annual rate of Exchequer grant hitherto provided.8.      The payments under the Milk Acts to the Milk Marketing Boards and the Government of Northern Ireland in respect of milkused for manufacture are, under those Acts, treated as advances repayable to the Exchequer in whole or part over the period April, 1936, to September, 1940, if the price of imported butter and cheese or, as regards Northern Ireland, the price paid for manufacturing milk by registered creameries rises above a certain level in any month.      The White Paper stated that it was proposed to relieve the Milk Boards from any balance of this liability accruing after the 30th September, 1957. In fact, under existing legislation, payments are due from the3.
Boards in respect of a certain gallonage of milk manufactured in January and February of this year, and in default of further legislation those payments would shortly have to be demanded, notwithstanding the promise in the White Paper quoted above. We, therefore, propose that provision should be made in the extending Bill to implement this proposal of the White paper with regard to payments due either from the Milk Marketing Boards or from the Government of Northern Ireland.9.      We also propose that the provision for Exchequer grant for the Milk-in-Schools and related Schemes should be increased for the period to be covered by the Bill*      The existing legislation authorises payment (subject to an over-riding limit of  2,000,000 for the period of four years ending 30th September, 1938) of up to one-half of the expenses incurred by Milk Marketing Boards in giving effect to approved schemes for increasing the demand for milk.      The Milk-in-Schools Scheme has been the chief scheme aided under these provisions, but grants have also been given for schemes for press and poster publicity and for investigations into the nutritive value of milk.      The White Paper of July, 1937, did not propose the continuation of these last two Schemes but did state that the Government regarded the    continuation of the Milk-in-Schools Scheme as an essential part of their proposals and also that the Government would bring forward proposals for securing, in co-operation with the industry, a reduction in the price of liquid milk to local authorities for the purpose of their maternity and child welfare arrangement s.10.      If the precedent of the previous Milk Acts were followed, the amount of additional Exchequer grant available for the Milk-in-Schools and similar schemes would be limited to  500,000, making a total of  2,500,000   for the period ending 30th September, 1939.      Owing to the increase in the amount of4.
milk &quot;being drunk in schools this sum would be exhausted (failing further legislation)  in the spring of 1939.      In such circumstances, the Milk Boards would &quot;be unwilling to introduce various desirable modifications such as an increase in the distributive margin on milk for small remote rural (schools which at present have difficulty in getting supplies, or to agree to any additional scheme for cheap milk for maternity and child welfare purposes. The President of the Board of Education and the Minister of Health attach great importance t.o frha early xJ0V l&amp;pme;it of these social   services as contemplated in the White Paper.11.     We accordingly propose that in extending Section 11 of the 1934 Act which enables Exchequer grants to be made to.Milk Boards for assisting approved schemes for increasing the demand for milk, provision should be made for an additional sum of  750,000 to be made available instead of the  500,000 which has hitherto been the sum provided annually.      We propose, however, that the schemes to be approved under the extended statutory authority should be limited to those for the sale of milk at a reduced price for consumption by school-children (including children attending courses or centres such as are already within the scope of the existing arrangements) and by nursing and expectant mothers and children under school age.Summary.12.    (a) There will not now be time this Session for the passage of the necessary legislation to give effect to the proposals of the White Paper on Milk policy of July, 1937.   (Cmd. 5533), and we recommend that the introduction of the Bill should be deferred until the autumn (paragraphs 3 and 4).(b) In these circumstances we ask for authority for the preparation of a Bill for passage into law before parliament rises for the Summer Recess, to extend for a further year those provisions of the Milk Acts 1954 to 1937 which would otherwise expire at the 30th September next (paragraphs 5 and 6).5.
6o(c) We propose that the opportunity should he taken to implement the promise made in the.White Paper that the Milk Marketing Boards (and the Government   of Northern Ireland) should he released from&apos;any liability accruing after the 30th september,   1937,  for the repayment of advances under the Milk Acts (Paragraph 8).(d) We propose that,  during the year by which the period for Exchequer grants for schemes for increasing the demand for milk is to be extended;-(i) the sum of  750,000 should be provided for the piirpose of Exchequer grants on approved schemes; (ii) the schemes to be approved should be confined to those for the sale of milk at reduced prices for consumption by school-children,  and by nursing and expectant mothers and children under school age (paragraphs 9 to 11).W.S.M.J o Co10th June, 1938.
