The Cabinet, at their Meeting held on the 4th May,1938 , reached the following conclusions on the subject of&quot;the proposed Staff conversations with France and Belgium:-&quot;(a)   That the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should consult the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee as to any points he considered necessary arising out of the Anglo-French conversations, and that he should ask for the report to be furnished as soon as possible.(b) That the Secretary of State should beauthorised to inform the Chiefs of Staff that the general scope of the conversations was as outlined in the record of the Anglo-French conversations (CP. 109(38)).(c) That the conversations with the BelgianGovernment should be undertaken through the channel of the Service Attaches. In their case, nothing should be published and no conmTunication should be made to the German Government.&quot;^Cabinet     22(38), Con. 4.
2. In accordance with. Conclusion (a) above, the ForeignOffice have invited   us to give our views &quot;as soon as possible as to the scope of the contemplated contacts with the French Naval and Army Staffs, in the light of the discussions    that took place and of&apos; the decisions reached during the conversations held with the French Ministers on the 28th and 29th April, 1938.&quot; And they have suggested&apos;&quot;that the scope of these contacts, should, so far as possible, be adeq.uate to ensure the due arrangement of the technical conditions in which the obligations of the United Kingdom and .France to each other should be carried out in case of unprovoked aggression, in the circumstances postulated&quot;.3. In accordance with Conclusion (c) above, the ForeignOffice have invited us to elaborate the views which we expressed in paragraph 28 of Paper No. . CCS. 707 (Enclosure to Paper No. D.P.(P) 24) in respect of contacts with the Belgian General Staff, having regard to the considerations set out in paragraphs 3 and 4 of the Annex.4. Finally, the Foreign Office ask (see paragraph 5 of the annex) whether, in our view, it v/ould be desirable from the military point of view that the contacts now in contemplation with the French and Belgian Staffs should, at some future stage, be conducted on a triangular basis.See Annex to this Report. &amp; See Paper No. .D.P.(P) 27.
STAFF CONVERSATIONS WITH THE. FRENCH,    &apos; The medium of conversations.5. There is a general point affecting all three services which we desire to emphasise at the outset.      During the recent Anglo-French conversations, it was agreed&quot; that &quot;it would he convenient if such contacts (i.e.  army contacts) were established through the medium of the Military Attaches, as was already contemplated for the first stage of the air contacts&quot;, and we assume that any naval conversations which may he held will likewise he conducted through Naval Attaches. From past experience of dealing with the French, we are inclined to think that they will attempt to raise the conduct of the conversations to a higher level.      We consider that our Attaches should he instructed to resist any such attempt, at any rate in the early stages.So far as the Navy is concerned, we recommend that at no stage should the conversations reach a level on our side higher than Directors of Admiralty Divisions^Air Staff Conversations.6. The scope of the air staff contacts with the Frenchhas already been precisely defined^ and there are no further points on which we need comment or- seek Ministerial guidance.Naval Conversations.7. So far as naval contacts are concerned, we adhere tothe views expressed   in our last Report, subject to such modifications as are necessitated by the decision that36 See Paper No. D.P. (?) 27, pp.  9 and 10.jzf Paper No. D.P.(P) pp.   3 and 9./ Enclosure to Paper No.. D.P.(P) 24, paras, 8 - 10./ Paper No. D.P.(P) 27, page 3.
the proposed Staff contacts should he founded on the political assumption that Germany alone would he the aggressor, and that the extension of the war to other Powers, whether as potential enemies or as potential allies, was not to he envisaged^.8. Scope,     We consider that the scope of navalconversations should embrace an exchange of information with regard to:-(a) Proposed dispositions for war.(b) Dispositions for the protection of seabornetrade throughout the world.(c) State of forces now in commission and reserves(d) Availability and defences of ports.(e) Communications and signal codes,.(f) Liaison officers.. ...(g) Questions of command.So far as is possible, it is recommended that discussions on the headings tabulated above should be dealt with on broad lines, without going into greater detail of naval dispositions than is absolutely necessary.9. Forces.      The conversations should be related to thepresent strength of all naval forces in commission and in reserve of Great Britain and France.10.       Areas.      The naval areas to be discussed should be the North Sea, English Channel, Atlantic and Mediterranean..Army Conversations.11.       The following passage occurs in the record of the recent Anglo-French conversations:-
&quot;LORD HALIFAX said that if he had rightly understood M.. Daladier, the following conclusions has he-en reached: -5e Jrr 35xxx   Subject to a full appreciation of Mr.  Chamberlain&apos;s- statement on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government to the effect that they could not be under any definite commitment to send even two divisions to France on the outbreak of war, although circumstances might no doubt develop in such a way that more would, in fact, be sent later, and on that understanding His Majesty&apos;s Government would not be unwilling for the military position to be examined in the manner contemplated &quot;by M. Daladier. &quot;    x   x   .xIt is of the first importance that we should have clear instructions as to the precise implication of the words &quot;although circumstances might no doubt develop in such a way that more would, in fact, be sent later.&quot;12.        The size of the forces which we could send abroadnow, and in the future,  is briefly as follows:-(a)    Present situation (May 1958).We can put into the field two divisions only, with an incomplete quota of corps troops, and deficient of many types of equipment essential for war under modern conditions.      Arrangements are in hand to land this force in France within 14 days from the date the decision is taken to despatch it.(d)    Anticipated situation (April 1959).le should be able to put       o the field an additional two divisions which would be ready to embark in forty days from the date of the decision. The force as a whole would still have an incomplete quota of corps troops9 and still be deficient of many types of equipment and reserves essential for war under modern conditions-,
(c) Anticipated situation (April, 1940)eThe Mohile Division would he available in addition to the four divisions.     Generally-speaking, the force would he provided with up-to-date armament and equipment, with the important exception of medium and heavy artillery, hut two out of the four infantry divisions will only have reserves on a scale considerably lower than that regarded as essential for war under modern conditions.(d) Further Regular or Territorial Army formations.Under present arrangements no further Regular or Territorial Army formations can he ready to proceed overseas, properly equipped and with the necessary reserves for war against a first class enemy, for twelve months or more after the outbreak of war013.       It is clear, from the record of the recent Anglo-French conversations, that our military attache in Paris may he authorised to discuss arrangements in connection with the despatch of the force mentioned in para 12(a) above;   hut it is more than likely that, in view of the passage quoted in para. 11 above, the French will press him for information as to the strength.and composition of subsequent contingentso     In the absence of clear instructions, our military attache will he placed in a quandrary and indeed the question is likely to be raised here &quot;bjr the French Military Attache in London,,14.       There is a further point.      In making administrative preparations it is always of great importance to consider not merely the initial forces hut also to make allowance, if only &quot;b-j, reserving space for expansion, for other forces which may subsequently he despatched to the theatre of war.     This can be done, of course, without entering upon any commitment, hut it will he difficult, if not impossible, to discuss such matters adequately with the French without their becoming aware that there is a possibility of further forces &quot;being made available.
15.       We therefore request guidance as to whether we should confine ourselves rigidly to the arrangements for the two initial divisions, or whether the discussions may he extended to include the possibility of the despatch of further.fo rmoti ons 016.       The Staff Conversations of 1936 &quot;between the French ard British General Staffs resulted in the collection of a good deal of useful material which can now be &quot;brought up to date. But from the administrative point of view, and administrative questions will preponderate, it is very desirable that this information should be carried a stage further hy the visit of a limited number of junior staff officers (in plain clothes) to ports of disembarkation in France in order to carry out a technical reconnaissances     It is not proposed thereby to raise the conduct of the conversations to a higher level - in paragraph 5 we have disc-ounteaxanced the idea -hut rather to extend their field and to gain further information of great practical value,    &apos; We ask for a ruling whether this extension is permissible.,17.        Scope.      As far as the employment of any army forces which may be available is concerned, the scope of the conversations should only cover the movement up to and including the assembly area34 and would include the following administrative questions(a) The facilities that will he given at the ports ofdisembarkation in France and, if possible, what ports would he available0 It is desirable that they should he, as far as possible, outside the range of sustained German air attack0(b) The road and railway facilities from these ports uponwhich we can rely for the movement of our formations to assembly areas,(c) Allotment to the field force of alternative assemblyareas and arrangements for billeting therein.,(d) The protection against air attack which might hecontributed by the French during the movement.K   Assembly Area,,    Area in which personnel, vehicles and equipment re-unite after independent shipment to and disembarkation at base ports.
18.       We observe that M. Daladier   referred, in the course   wi) of the l^ecent conversations, to the transportation and installation of our initial two divisions.     We are not clear as to what he had in mind, but we would emphasise that there should he no question of arranging concentratioh&quot;areas.   These cannot properly be decided in peace time and must depend on the general strategical situation at the time of the despatch of the field force;&apos; it is very necessary that we should retain liberty of action in this respecto19.       We should point out that if an advance air striking force is employed in the same theatre as the field force, the base and L, of C. units required by the former can be found within the existing resources of the army.     If, on the other hand, the advanced air striking force, and the field force have to operate in different theatres, additional units must be formed for which no provision exists at present.CONVERSATIONS WITH THE BELGIANS. 20.       Staff contacts with the Belgians differ in many respects from those contemplated with the French.      In the first place, the question of naval contacts does not arise. Secondly, our Military Attache in Brussels is already in close touch with the Belgian General Staff, &quot;and the latter have communicated to us the general lines of their initial war dispositions and plans.     Moreover, since we do not contemplate the establishment of a military force in Belgium on the outbreak of war, the discussion   of administrative details on similar lines to those contemplated with the French is unnecessary.21..      So far as air forces are concerned, we do not require facilities in Belgium for any advanced air striking force on the outbreak of war.      On the other hand there arex   Concentration Area.    The area in the theatre of operations in which the fighting formations concentrate before  advancing to the battle area.
a number of matters which could with advantage he discussed between the Belgians and ourselves.      These may be summarised as follows:-(a) Bases in Belgium which our fighter aircraft might use in case of necessity, either for the purpose of following up retreating enemy raiders, or in case of bad weather over England, or possibly for the accommodation of forward fighter patrols to protect our own bomber operations.(b) Linking the Belgian air defence system,including their observation system, with our own.      This would entail the co-ordination and linking-up by land line of the two observation systems, and arrangements for routeing our own bombers over Belgium, and for recognition between our own bombers and Belgian air and anti-air defences.(c) Exchange of information concerning airtargets in Germany, including information about the German air force and aircraft factories.22.       We recommend that our Air Attache in Brussels shotild be instructed to enter into conversations on the above points with the Belgian Staff.23.      The Foreign Office have advised&quot; us that contacts with the Belgian Staff should be established and conducted in such a way that, if they have to be mentioned in any public statement by His Majesty1s Ministers, it should be possible wi,;fch ..truth to say no more than that &quot;normal contacts with the Belgian military authorities are being maintained through the Service attaches&quot;.We submit that conversations of the limited scope which we have recommended in the preceding paragraph could truthfully be so described.se   See Annex, Paragraph 3(3).
TRIANGULAR CONVERSATIONS.24. Finally, we come to the question of whether it wouldbe desirable that the contacts now in contemplation with the French and Belgian Staffs should at some future stage be conducted on a triangular basis.    We consider that there would be no advantage in this, from the military point of view, so long as the scope of the conversations is kept within the limits recommended in this Report.      We are informed that,  for political reasons, His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Brussels is of the same opinion.      It would be difficult,  in fact, to regard triangular conversations as being among those &apos;normal contacts&apos; which the Foreign Office desire to maintain.SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS.25.      (i)    We assume that the medium of the Naval,  Armyand Air Conversations with the French will ber- .....through Service Attaches and we recommend thatour representatives in Paris should be instructed to resist any attempt on the partof the French to raise the contacts to a higher level,  at any rate in the early stages.    Sofar as the Navy is concerned we recommend thatat no stage should the conversations reach thelevel on our side of higher than Directors ofAdmiralty Divisions (paragraph 5);(ii)    With regard to the Army Conversations,  werequest guidance as to:(a)   Whether our Military Attache should be instructed to confine himself rigidly to the discussion of the arrangements incidental to the establishment of the two initial divisions on the Continent,  or whether he may extend the discussions to include the pcssibility of the despatch of further formations (paragraphs 11-15)^
and (b)    Whether it will be permissible to enlarge the usefulness of the conversations by including administrative reconnaissances at the ports of disembarkation by a few junior staff officers in plain clothes.     (paragraph 16)(iii)    Subject to confirmation of our assumptionin&apos;(i) above and to instructions on theimportant points referred to in (ii),we request approvalfhr the scope ofthe Naval and Army Conversations withthe French as outlined in paragraphs 7 -10 and 17 - 19 respectively;(iv)   We recommend that contacts with the belgians,  over and above those already existing between our Military Attache^in Brussels and the Belgian GeneralStaff should be confined to conversations on the attache level on certain airquestions summarised in paragraph 21.We submit that if conversations with the belgians on the above limited scale are authorised,   it should be possible withtruth to say in any public statement by His Majesty&apos;s Ministers that&quot;normal contacts with the BelgianMilitary Authorities are being maintained with the Service Attaches&quot;.(paragraph ^3)0(v)    We consider that there would be no advantage,  from the military point of
view, in entering into triangular conversations with the French and Belgians so long as the scope of the conversations is kept within the limits recommended in this Report.(Signed) CHATFIELD.&quot;        O.L.N. NEWALL. &quot; GORT.Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1., 20th May,  1938.-12-
Cow of a letter dated lOth^MM-x-l^i-^^LM^JsL-. Strange Foreign Office,  to the Secreta/ry^Coim^Defence.X       X       XI am directed by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to invite attention to the following Conclusions reached &quot;by the Cabinet at their Meeting held on the 4th May,  1933,  on the subject of the proposed contacts with the French and Belgian General Staffs&quot;(a)  That the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should consult the Chief6 of Staff Sub-Committee as to any points he considered necessary arising out of the Anglo-French conversations,  and that he should ask for the report to be furnished as soon as possible&quot;.&quot;(b) That the Secretary of State should be authorised to inform the Chiefs of Staff that the general scope of the conversations was as outlined in the record of the Anglo-French conversations (CP. 109(38)).&quot;&quot;(c) That the conversations with the Belgian Government should be undertaken through    the channel of the Service Attaches.      In their case, nothing should be published and no communication should be made to the German Government.&quot;13-
2.  -    I am to request, with reference to Conclusion (a) above, that the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee may be invited to give their views as soon as possible as to the scope of the contemplated contacts with the French Naval and Army staffs in the light of the discussions that took place and of the decisions reached during the conversations held with the French Ministers on 28th and 29th April, 1938.&apos;   It is suggested that the scope of these contacts should  so far as possible, be adequate to ensure the due arrangement of the technical conditions in which the obligations of the United Kingdom and France to each other should be carried out in case of unprovoked aggression, in the circumstances postulated.3.        I am also to request, with reference to Conclusion (c) above, that the Chiefs of Staff should be invited to elaborate the views expressed in paragraph 28 of their report No.  C..0.S. 707 in respect of contacts with the Belgian General Staff, having regard to the following considerations :-(l) the latest approach from the Belgian side has been made not through the diplomatic channel,, but by the Belgian Chief of Staff, perhaps to some extent on his own authority;(2) it is thus desirable that any communications on this matter with the Belgian authorities should be conducted at Brussels through the channel of the Military and Air Attaches to His Majesty&apos;s Embassy;
(3) In view of possible Belgian susceptibilities,  it is to be hoped that contacts with the Belgian Staff can be established and conducted in such a way as ttf make it possible for His Majesty&apos;s Ministers to avoid saying anything in public to suggest that any new and important step has been taken in the matter of contacts between the British and Belgian staffs.      If anything has to be sail in public at all,  it would be desirable that it ahuuld be possible, with truth,  to say no more than that &quot;normal contacts with the Belgian Military authorities   are being maintained through the Service Attached&quot;,  or words to this effect.      The position of ^he Belgian Government appears to be that while pursing their  so-called policy of independence,  they are at the same time willing,  and even anxious,  to maintain a very close liaison with us,  in secret,  in military matters.(4) It is also important,  for the same reason, that no reference should be made to the German (or Italian) Government about the contemplated Staff contacts with Belgium.4,      The Chief of the Belgian General Staff has recently reverted to the question of Anglo-Belgian Staff contacts in conversation with members of His Majesty&apos;s Embassy at Brussels, and has suggested that it would he in the interest of b^th Great Britain and Belgium that Anglo-Belgian talks of the kind he proposed should be started without too   much delay,  especially in view of the fact that there were now to be technical discussions between the British and French Staffs.      He stressed the importance he attached to linking up the ground observation posts with London,
i -   *      445. I am,  in conclusion, to suggest that the Chiefs ofStaff might take this opportunity of considering whether it would &quot;be desirable,  from the military point of view, that the contacts now in contemplation with the French and Belgian Staffs should at some future stage be conducted on a triangular basis.      It cannot be assumed that the Belgian General Staff would be willing to deal with the French General Staff on the same basis of confidence as with our own;    but it would-,  in Lord Halifax&apos;s view, be useful if the desirability of such an extension of the proposed-contacts could now be examined on an hypothetical basis.s        x&quot;        k        x (Signed) W.
