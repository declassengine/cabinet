OVERSEAS TRADE.      Imports in April at  73.7 million were  9.2 million less than in April, 1937;    imports of food, drink and tjobacco Were  0.8 million less, and raw materials and articles mainly unmanufactured were  4.5 million less.     Exports of United Kingdom products,  37.3 million, were  5.8 million lessiEMPLOYMENT.      Employment at 4th April showed little ehange, on the whole, as compared with 14th March.It is provisionally estimated that at 4th April, 1938, the number of insured persons, aged 16-64 in employment in Great Britain, exclusive of persons within the agricultural scheme, was approximately 11,390,000.      This was 10,000 more than at 14th March, 1938, but on a comparable basis, about 130,000 less than at 19th April,  1937.There was an improvement in employment between 14th March and 4th April, in the building industry, the tailoring trade, motor vehicle, cycle and aircraft manufacture, furniture manufacture, the distributive trades, hotel and boarding house service, and agriculture.      On the other hand, employment declined in coal mining, and in the iron and steel, cotton, hosiery, and textile bleaching,&apos; printing and dyeing industries.RAILWAY TRAFFIC.      In the five week s ended 1st May, railway traffic receipts decreased by  261,000 (1.72 per cent.) as compared with the corresponding period of 1937.     The value ofglDENTIAL.

passenger traffic increased &quot;by 13.83 per cent;    merchandise, minerals and livestock decreased by 11.47 per cent., and coal, coke, etc., by 12.92 per cent.     The comparisons are affected by the incidence of the Easter holidays.     As from 1st October last charges were increased by 5 per cent.SHIPPING.      There was a further slight fall in the Chamber of Shipping index number for shipping freights, which reached 95 (basis:    1929 s 100).     The laid-up tonnage on 1st April in the ports of Great Britain and Ireland, at 339,000 net tons, was the highest since october , 1936.     A number of ships (over seventy) were also tied up in the River Plate.      In view of the serious outlook, a draft scheme for an international compensation pool was recently approved in principle at a meeting in London of British tramp and cargo liner owners and subsequently by the Consultative Committee of the International Shipping Conference.SHIPBUILDING. New orders for merchant tonnage were still scarce, although employment was well maintained in the yards.BANKING.      Money continued easy throughout April.     The average Treasury Bill rate remained very low&apos;between 10s. 1.99d. - 10s.3.24d.     Gold prices weakened in sympathy with the dollar, although fluctuations were small.FINANCIAL CONDITIONS ABROAD.Argentina.      The visible balance of trade in 1937 was favourable by 753.3 million pesos, of which only 13 million pesos accrued in the second half of the year.     To check deterioration in the balance of payments the &quot;free&quot; peso was allowed to fall to 20 at the end of March, but has since recovered to about 19.Finland.     The adverse balance of trade for the first quarter of 1938 was considerably higher than in 1937.     Export prospects are not encouraging.     Net foreign holdings in Finnish Banks rose to 2,550.4 million Finnish marks at the
end of March ( 11,2 million).      In 1936 and 1937, external public debt has been reduced by  4.3 million.Prance.     Early in May the new Government issued decrees in connection with the plan for restoring French finances.     The franc was depreciated to the level of 179&apos; to the  , below which the authorities announced that the franc would not be allowed to fall.     Hopes were held out of. an appreciation from this point.     Prices and cost of living continued to rise but there was a marked Stock Exchange recovery.Germany.     Although the index of production for the early part of 1938 remained slightly higher than in 1937, foreign trade was affected by world conditions and the balance for the first quarter was adverse by Rm.39 million as against a favourable balance in 1937,U..S.A.     There was no material improvement during April. The volume of business on the Stock Exchange was smaller than in March but average prices were higher than the low quotations ruling at the end of that month.     The dollar fell sharply over Easter, but after moderate control, recovered and closed around 4.98-^.COAL. For the thirteen weeks ended 23rd April, the weekly output of coal was over 2 per cent, less than in the corresponding period of 1937. The usual seasonal fall in domestic demand was accompanied by a decline in home demand for industrial coal, and in all classes of coal for export. Exports in April were valued at  2.8 million, compared with  2.9 million a year ago.IRON AND STEEL.      The volume of new orders was less, and production was not maintained at the same high rate during April,     Heavy steel makers continued busy but the lighter branches were quiet.      Large stocks of pig iron and semis accumulated and supplies of scrap were ample to meet all
requirements.     Pig iron output (661,000 tons) was slightly-less than in March;    crude steel production (938,600 tons) was 13% less than a year ago.      Exports of iron and steel in April (168,000 tons) were 71,000 tons less than in April 1937. Imports (61,000 tons) were 27,000 tons less.ENGINEERING.      There was no further deterioration of business during April, hut new civil lousiness remained sluggish-Exports of machinery in April amounted to  4.90 million, as compared with  4.11 million in April, 1937.      Imports ( 1.8 million) were  412,000 less.NON - -FERROUS METALS.      Metal prices continued steady in April despite a falling off in Russian and Japanese buying. Demand from the Continent and in this country was slightly better than in the first quarter.      Copper sales in the United States showed no improvement, but elsewhere deliveries in March were the highest recorded.      United Kingdom demand in spelter improved.MOTOR INDUSTRY,      The number of motor vehicles newly registered in March (47,215) was 1,305 less than a year before-, and sales of motor vehicles declined by 3.4 per cent,      Foreign markets, however, are showing some improvement.ELECTRICAL INDUSTRY.      The general position shows little improvement.      Exports for the first 4 months of this year-amounted to  7,137,000 or 27  above those for the corresponding period of 1937.COTTON.      Production in March was at the lowest level for this time of the year since the War,      New business was small and stocks were increasing.     The daily yarn output Index was 83 in April as compared with 92 in March (1935 - 100),      Yarn exports in April (10.1 million lbs.) were 4.6 million lbs. less than In April, 1937.      Exports of piece goods were 115 million square yards as compared with 165 million square yards the year before-
iWOOL.     Activity in all areas tended to decline during April.     Exports of tops, yarns and tissues were substantially less than in April, 1937.HIDES AND LEATHER.      The Hides market was fairly steady during April, hut business in all sections of the leather industry, even allowing for the Easter holidays, was on a low scale.CHEMICALS.      There was a further recession in the trade in heavy chemicals during April.      Both home and export deliveries of alkalis and chlorine products were appreciably lower than in March.     Home sales of dyestuffs continued depressed, and in addition to the low demand from the textile trades, demand fell off in printing and paper manufacture;    exports also declined, though sales in India and Turkey were better than in 1937.POTTERY.      Employment in March was substantially less than a year ago, and all sections report slackness in demand.     Home trade in china deteriorated, and demand in the Earthenware sections was weak;    exports, however, showed some improvement. Trade continued to fall off in the tile sections and in sanitary earthenware.      Orders for electrical fittings were considerably below those of March, 1937,RETAIL TRADE.      The money value of daily retail sales in March was 3.7 per cent, lower than in March, 1937.     This decline was due to the change in the date of Easter, as compared with a year ago, and it is probable that sales for the calendar month were higher than those of March, 1937.      Sales of food and perishables decreased in value by 1.2 per cent;    sales of non-food merchandise declined by 7.1 per cent.     Preliminary returns for April indicate a considerable Increase in sales in comparison with a year ago.CANADIAN TRADE.      Business operations improved slightly in March in contrast with declines in the three preceding months,
the index of. the physical volume of business rising to 108.8 as compared with 106.7 in February.AUSTRALIAN TRADE.      Bales of&apos; wool received into store during the nine months ended 31st March were 2,701,000 compared with 2,585,000 a year before, the quantities sold or shipped being &apos; 2,148,000 and 2,380,000, respectively.     Wheat and flour shipments between 1st December and 25th April were equivalent to 68.3 million bushels, compared with 48.9 million bushels in the previous year.     Production for the year ending 30th June is now estimated at 180 million bushels.     Butter exports from 1st July to 23rd April were 78,000 tons, compared with 68,000 tons a year before.      Imports of merchandise in March amounted to  12.1 million (Australian currency) compared with  9.8 million last year.SOUTH AFRICAN TRADE.      Imports in March were 3.3 per cent, more than a year before.     Exports other than gold were very slightly lower than in March, 1937, gold exports being 3,1 per cent. more.     The increases in exports of diamonds, and of bunker coal, were substantial.     There were appreciable declines in exports of wool, hides and skins, wattle bark and extract, and copper^SOUTH AMERICAN TRADE.Argentina.      The trade tendencies of the first quarter of the year   continued in April.     Grain exports were even lower than the poor crop results seemed to justify, but as regards prices only maize was higher than a year ago.     Total Anglo-Argentine trade for the first quarter declined, but British exports (owing mainly to deliveries upon orders given up to last November) showed an increase.Uruguay.     In the first quarter of 1938, reduced shipments of wool to Great Britain (which showed some improvement in April) were counter-balanced by increased shipments of chilled
beef at higher prices.     British exports to Uruguay increased by 23 per cent,  over a year ago.Chile.      Economic conditions remained favourable;    the copper and nitrate industries continued active and prices for these commodities were- firm.
