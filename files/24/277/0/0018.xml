Printed for the Cabinet.   June 1938.SECRET. . Copy No.CP. 137 (38).CABINET.MALTA.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.The case of Strickland versus&quot;Sammut and Another.I HAVE to inform my colleagues of the constitutional position which may arise in Malta as a result of an action recently brought in the Malta Courts by Lord Strickland. In this action the Court of Appeal in Malta have held that the Malta Letters Patent of the 12th August, 1936, issued in pursuance of the Malta (Letters Patent) Act 1936, were issued ultra vires and that, in consequence, all Ordinances passed under them are invalid. Lord Strickland&apos;s contentions are :  (a) That, owing to the circumstances in which Malta became part of theBritish Empire, the Crown never had ab initio a right to legislate by Orders in Council or Letters Patent for Malta, although such power had consistently been exercised from the earliest period.(b) Alternatively, that, although the Crown had power to revoke, as it didon the 12th August, 1936, the Letters Patent in force up to that date, it had lost the power which it previously possessed to make provision by Orders in Council or Letters Patent for the Government of Malta, and that the Act of 1936 had not been effective to restore this power.2. The Malta Court of Appeal gave leave to appeal from this judgment to the Privy Council and at the same time granted a stay of execution. The hearing of the appeal by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council has been fixed for the 20th June. *3. I do not anticipate that the Malta judgment will be upheld by the Privy Council, and, if it is not upheld, there will be no further difficulty arising from this case. If, on the other hand, the judgment of the Malta Court of Appeal is upheld, the position of the Malta Government will become impossible, since not only will the Ordinances enacted under the present constitution become invalid, but there will be no further power for the Governor to legislate for Malta (except possibly over a very restricted range of subjects).4. I therefore seek the Cabinefs authority for making, in the event of the appeal being dismissed by the Privy Council, an immediate announcement that His Majesty&apos;s Government will ask Parliament to validate retrospectively the Letters Patent of 12th August, 1936, and the Ordinances enacted thereunder, and to make further provision for the Government of Malta. As I have indicated above, I do not think that the need for this legislation in Parliament is a likely contingency, but if legislation is required it will be necessary to pass it as a matter of urgency.

2-  Proposals for-a New Constitution.5. I wish also to take this opportunity to inform my colleagues that my predecessor and I have been considering, in consultation with the Governor, proposals for a revised constitution for Malta including provision for some measure of popular representation. As my colleagues will be aware, the 1921 constitution of Malta, which was of a dyarchical character and included provision for an elected Legislature and responsible government in the sphere not reserved to the Imperial side of the dyarchy, was, after many vicissitudes, including two suspensions (in 1930 and in 1933), finally revoked under the powers conveyed by the Malta Letters Patent Act, 1936. The reasons which led to the introduction of that Act were-explained to the Cabinet at the time: see CP. 156 (35) and CP. 91 (36). As a result of the passage of the Act, the Malta Constitution Letters Patent of 1921 were revoked and new Letters Patent were issued on the 12th August, 1936, containing the present Malta constitution. These Letters Patent provide for a constitution on the strictest &quot; Crown Colony &quot; model in which all powers of administration and legislation are exercised by the Governor, assisted only by an advisory Executive Council consisting partly of official and partly of nominated unofficial members.6. It was never the intention that this form of constitution should be permanent. The idea was that it would give the Island a respite from the political strife with which it had been troubled during the preceding years and that, after such a period of rest, the population should be allowed to have a share in the work of Government through some form of popular representation. This point was mentioned in the last paragraph of the memorandum which was circulated to the Cabinet in July 1935, CP. 156 (35), and was also mentioned both by Lord Plymouth in the House of Lords and by Lord Harlech in the House of Commons in the debates on the Malta Letters Patent Bill.7, The Governor has now represented strongly that the time has arrived for introducing the proposed representative constitution. He states that there is a demand for this from all sections of the population, who feel that it is a slight upon the dignity of an advanced and highly educated people such as the Maltese to be governed under a form of constitution which gives them no say in government.8. The proposals which the Governor has submitted provide for a Council of Government consisting partly of elected members and containing an unofficial majority, but, of course, with certain safeguards and reserved powers in the hands of the Governor, I have not yet formed a decision upon the details of the Governors proposals, and I will not, therefore, describe them in further detail. I propose to circulate a further memorandum on this subject in due course. I agree with the Governor that, from the point of view of furthering Imperial interests in Malta, the best policy will be to grant a more liberal constitution without further delay, and I seek the authority of the Cabinet to proceed on this assumption. There is no question of granting responsible government of the type contained in the 1921 constitution, which after a long trial proved its unsuitability to the conditions of Malta.9. The reason why I trouble my colleagues with this general consideration at the present time is that the case now pending before the Privy Council has aroused much interest in Malta, and if, as I hope and expect, the Privy Council uphold the appeal of the Malta Government, it will be desirable to make an announcement of the intention of His Majesty&apos;s Government to introduce a new constitution as soon as possible after the issue of the Privy Council&apos;s decision. If, however, the appeal is dismissed, and it is necessary to pass an Imperial Act validating the existing constitution and legislation in Malta, the announcement of His Majesty&apos;s Governments intention to introduce a new constitution should, I think, be deferred until the validating legislation is introduced in Parliament.Summary of Proposals. 10.   I ask the Cabinets leave,(a) in the event of the dismissal of the Malta Governments appeal now pending before the Privy Council to make an immediate announcement that His Majesty&apos;s Government will ask Parliament to validate
retrospectively the Letters Patent of the 12th August, 1936, which govern the present Malta constitution and the Ordinances enacted thereunder.(b) To proceed with consideration of a revised and more liberal constitution for Malta.(c) To make an announcement of His Majesty&apos;s Governments intention tointroduce a new constitution either(i) in the event of the Privy Council upholding the Malta Govern-ment&apos;s appeal, immediately following that decision, or (ii) in the event of the dismissal of the appeal, at the time of the introduction in Parliament of the legislation necessary to safe-guard the position in Malta.M. M.Colonial Office, June 7. 1938.
