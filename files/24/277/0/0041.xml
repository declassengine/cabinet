Printed for the Cabinet.   July 1938.SECRET. Copy No.      4 3CP. 160 (38).CABINET.QUESTION OF THE TRANSFER TO THE UNION OF THE GOVERN-MENT OF THE HIGH COMMISSION TERRITORIES IN SOUTH AFRICA.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.IN the memoranda by my predecessor Nos. CP. 28 (38) and 61 (38), of February and March last, it was explained that as a result of discussions with General Hertzog on this subject it had been agreed that (a) a Joint Advisory Conference consisting of the three Resident Commissioners and three officers of the Union Government should be constituted to consider openings for co-operation between the Union Government and the Administrations; (5) that memoranda should be issued by the Union Government for the purpose of giving the inhabitants of the Territories a clear picture of the terms on which the transfer 61 the government of the Territories to the Union, if decided upon, would take place, and of the economic advantages which the Union Government anticipate would accrue to the peoples of the Territories.2. A statement to this effect was made by Mr. MacDonald and General Hertzog on the 29th March, in the terms set out in Appendix A.The Joint Advisory Conference has now been constituted and held a preliminary meeting on the 6th May, when it was agreed that visits should be made by members of the Conference to the Territories and to native areas in the Union. The Acting High Commissioner reported after this meeting that he understood that the Union members of the Conference proposed to suggest that the publication of the Union memoranda should be postponed until&apos;after their visits to the Territories (which were unlikely to be completed until October) in case they might then have modifications to suggest. I should explain that the Union Government have recently, on their own initiative, arranged for a visit of Basuto and Swazi Chiefs to the Transkei and Ciskei areas of the Union, and that Mr. Smit, the Union Secretary for Native Affairs, who is a member of the-Joint Advisory Conference, accompanied the party. It appears that in consequence of what Mr. Smit saw of the Chiefs&apos; reactions during the tour and the enlightenment which he obtained from a short visit which he himself made to the Government headquarters in Basutoland, where he saw something of the development work in that Territory, he has come to realise that the acquiescence of the natives in transfer is perhaps unlikely in any event to be attainable, and that at any rate a better bid must be made for it than that set forth in the Union memoranda in their present form (see Appendix II to CP. 61 (38) ).In these circumstances it seems not improbable that the Union Government may Avish to reconsider the position.3. It is impossible therefore to be sure as yet what the final form of the memoranda (especially memorandum C) may be, but I have thought it desirable to take the opportunity of the presence on leave in this country of the High Commissioner, Sir William Clark, to discuss with him the arrangements to be made for the eventual presentation of the memoranda to the Native Authorities in the Territories. The memoranda, as presented, will, of course, have to be published here, but special arrangements will be necessary for making them available to the Native Authorities translated into the appropriate languages, and the Resident Commissioners of the Territories will have to give some explanation of the object of the memoranda. I attach as Appendix B a copyr of a draft letter, prepared by Sir William Clark, indicating the instructions [17513]
which it is suggested he should give to the Resident Commissioners regarding the communication of the memoranda to the Chiefs. These instructions will have to be communicated in draft to General Hertzog and we shall no doubt have to; be prepared to make them public, if a request to this effect is made in Parliament.     &apos;  &apos; -- 4. It will be seen that in the last paragraph of the proposed letter (Appendix B) it is mentioned that the Union Government will be glad to arrange for visits to the Territories of representatives who will be in a position to answer questions on the memoranda or to give such further information as may be required. General Hertzog, in paragraphs 20 and 64 of his letter to the then Secretary of State of last December (Appendix B to CP. 28 (38)), had suggested that it would be desirable to give Union representatives an opportunity of attending &apos;&apos; Pitsos &apos;&apos; and similar gatherings of natives in order to elucidate the Union memoranda. It is proposed, after consultation with the Resident Commissioners as to the most suitable procedure, to explain to the Union Government that there is no objection to Union representatives meeting the Chiefs (with the Resident Commissioner concerned present), but that as regards discussion at &quot;Pitsos&quot; and &quot; Kgotlas &quot; it would be best to feel the way and to consider the matter further in the light of the impressions which the Union representatives receive at their discussions with the Chiefs.5. At the meeting of the Cabinet on the 16th March when the memorandum CP. 61 (38) was under consideration, the view was expressed that it would be undesirable for the Government to associate themselves in any way with the Document E relating to the Native Policy of the Union Government. Sir William Clark subsequently telegraphed to General Hertzog, who by then had left Cape Town, informing him that His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom felt a certain difficulty about this memorandum; that it would seem to have been prepared- mainly with a view to opinion in the United Kingdom, and that the United Kingdom Government were doubtful about its suitability for inclusion among the other documents to be communicated to the inhabitants of the Terri-tories. He explained that the documents which the United Kingdom Government have had in mind were such as would indicate to the Natives and Europeans what would be the immediate and direct effect on them in the Territories of transfer taking place, and that we had not anticipated the addition to the memoranda of one dealing with the complex question of the Union&apos;s Native policy as a whole. Sir William Clark added that the Secretary of State would discuss the question with him when he Avas at home.6. It would not be altogether safe to assume that General Hertzog accepts our point of view, but even if he does, there remains the further question whether he contemplates publishing memorandum E in the Union at the same time as the other documents. As His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom have in the past taken the line that the natives of the Territories would require to know the Union Governments native policy before they could be expected to appreciate how their interests would be affected by transfer, it would be difficult to argue that the memorandum is entirely irrelevant, though, on the other hand, there is no doubt that it is at best a one-sided presentation of the case and not well suited for native consumption. It is proposed that Sir William Clark, on his return to South Africa, should resume the discussion with General Hertzog on the lines indicated in the previous paragraph; but he has suggested that, if it should appear that General Hertzog is unwilling to abandon the memorandum altogether, it should be proposed to him that it would be as well at least to hold it in reserve and use it as a document which could be communicated by the Union officials, to the Native Authorities in the Territories if questions should arise as to the Union native policy in the course of the discussions which, as exj)lained above, it is contemplated will take place between the Chiefs and the representa tives. of the Union Government.^ Under this procedure it would-be clear that the officers of the Administration were not themselves associated with memorandum E.7. I hope that my colleagues will approve the proposed course of action generally and, in particular, thai they will agree (1) to the draft instructions to the Resident Commissioners in Appendix B, and (2) to the line which it is suggested Sir William Clark should take with General Hertzog as to memorandum E, as set out in jDaragr-aph 6 above.S.Downing Street, July 7, 1938.
Joint Statement by Mr. MacDonald and General Hertzog, March 29, ,1938.GENERAL HERTZOG and I took the opportunity of his visit to England in May and June last to discuss the situation in regard&apos; to the transfer to the Union of the Government of the High Commission Territories and have since continued our communications on the subject. As regards the principles involved, His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom entirely accept the view expressed by General Hertzog in a speech in London in May 1935, that Section 151 of the South Africa Act (which deals with the transfer of the Government of the High Commission Territories to the Union) has a meaning and intention. His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom fully recognise the significance of the Section and do not seek to minimise it. At the same time the position of the United Kingdom Government is also governed by the pledges which were given during the passage of the South Africa Bill through the United Kingdom-Parliament in 1909, namely, that transfer should not take place until the wishes of the natives of the Territories had been most carefully considered, and that before such transfer the United Kingdom Parliament should be given the fullest opportunity of expressing its views.Bearing these fundamental conditions in mind, General Hertzog and I have been jointly studying what is the best and most practical course to pursue. We have especially had under consideration the progress made with the policy of co-operation adopted three years ago, the aim of which, as set out in the Aide-Memoire of 1935, was to demonstrate to the peoples^of the territories that &quot; the Union Government are working in concert with the local administrations with a real and generous desire to develop and improve conditions in the territories.&quot; It seems to us that, putting aside for the moment large financial schemes, there is room for a closer co-operation on lines which have not yet been fully explored. We have therefore agreed to constitute a standing joint advisory conference consisting of the Secretary for Native Affairs and two other officers of the Union Government together with the Resident Commissioners of the three High Commission Territories, whose function it will be to study openings for co-operation between the Union Government and the administrations in matters affecting the development of the territories and to consider any matters of joint concern to the Union and the territories such as prevention and control of animal diseases, marketing of produce, prevention of bubonic plague, &amp;c. The establish-ment of this Advisory Conference would not, of course, affect the present responsibility of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom for the government of the territories.It has also seemed to us desirable that the peoples of the territories should have before them a clear picture of the terms on which the transfer of the Government would take place, if decided upon. Such terms would naturally follow closely the provisions of the Schedule to the South Africa Act of 1909, but it seems to us important that His Majesty&apos;s Government in the Union should set them out in a more convenient and more complete form, so that the peoples of the territories may appreciate the conditions under which the territories would be governed, the position in regard to the maintenance of the tribal institutions of the natives, the economic advantages which the Union Government anticipate would accrue to the peoples of the territories and any other relevant matters. It has accordingly been arranged that memoranda should be prepared by the Union Government setting forth the terms which they would propose and that these memoranda should be made available for the information of the native and European inhabitants of the territories. We feel that this step will be very helpful in clarifying the whole question.APPENDIX A.
&apos;&apos;&apos; Draft [Instructions from High Commissioner to Resident Commissioners regarding  submission   to  Paramount   Chiefs   and   Chiefs of   UnionMemoranda.Resident Commissioner, Basutoland. Resident Commissioner, Swaziland.[Note. A similar letter would be sent to the Resident Commissioner,. Bechuanaland Protectorate, but would have to be worded differently as there is no Paramount Chief there.]YOU will remember that in the Joint Statement regarding the High Commission Territories issued by General Hertzog and Mr. Malcolm MacDonald on the 29th March, 1938, it was intimated that, with a view to clarifying the whole question, the Union Government would prepare certain memoranda setting forth in a convenient form the terms and conditions on which they would propose that the transfer of the Government, if decided upon, should take place. It was felt that this procedure would enable the peoples of the Territories to appreciate the conditions under which, in that event, the Territories would be governed, the position in regard to the maintenance of the tribal institutions of the natives, the economic advantages which the Union Government anticipate would accrue to the peoples of the Territories, and any other relevant matters.2. Copies of the memoranda prepared by the Union Government have already been sent to you so that you might have them translated into Sesuto (Swazi). The Union Government now propose to publish the memoranda in the press on , and after discussion with them we are inagreement that it is desirable for copies to be given to the Paramount Chief, for his confidential information *on the day (*two days) previous to publication.. You should therefore arrange to hand copies to the Paramount Chief on the morning of3. When giving the memoranda to the Paramount Chief, you should make it clear that the object in view in the preparation and publication of these memoranda is as described in the first paragraph of this letter, and you should impress upon him that it is his duty and that of his Councillors in studying them to keep in mind what will be best, alike in the present and the future, for his people.   -In order to avoid any misapprehensions, you should remind him that, as was intimated in the Joint Statement, the position of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom remains governed by the pledges which were given during the passage of the South Africa Bill through the United Kingdom Parliament in 1909, namely, that transfer should not take place until the wishes of the natives of the Territories had been most carefully considered and that before such transfer the United Kingdom Parliament should be given the fullest opportunity of expressing its views.4. You should further make it clear to the Paramount Chief that he is not being invited to express an opinion, formal or informal, upon the&apos; matter. The memoranda have been prepared by the Union Government simply for the information of the Chiefs and peoples of the Territories. You should add that the Union Government will be glad to arrange for visits to the Territories of representatives who will be in a position to answer any questions on the memoranda which the Paramount Chief or his Councillors may wish to ask or to give such further information as may be required and that the High Commis-sionef feels it is desirable that the Paramount Chief should avail himself of this offer. -   . . 1.        &apos;        - ;     , :&apos;.) ,   ,i -     ,The number of days in^advahee lias.not yet been decided.
