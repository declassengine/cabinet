(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNICMAJESTY1S GOVERNMENT)Copy No. . . -    CABINET. ADVERTISEMENT BROADCASTING. MEMORANDUM BY THE POSTMASTER GENERAL.1.     At their Meeting on the 11th of March, 1936 (Cabinet 17(36) Conclusion 7), the Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the Postmaster General (CP. 24(36)) submitting the Report of Lord Ullswater&apos;s Committee on the future of the broadcasting service.     The Report and Memorandum were referred to a Cabinet Committee, whose Report (CP.113(36)) was finally approved by the Cabinet at their Meeting on the 6th of May, 1936.2.     With regard to the broadcasting of advertisements, the Ullswater Committee made three recommendations which were summarised in section 143(a) of their Report in the following terms:(a) &quot;That direct advertisement should remain excluded from the broadcasting service&quot;- i.e. the B.B.C service (paragraph 109);(b) &quot;That &quot;sponsored&quot; items&quot; - that is to say, broadcast items with which is coupled an- announcement conveying an indirect advertisement - &quot;need not be entirely excluded, especially in the earliest stages of Television broadcasting, but that their admission should be carefully regulated hy the B.B.C.  (111 and 112);&quot;     A Reservation recommending the complete abolition of &quot;sponsored&quot; items was however formulated &quot;by vthree members of the Committee (Lord Elton, Major Astor, and Mr. Graham White).(c) &quot;That the responsible Departments should take all the steps which are within their power with a view to preventing the broadcasting from foreign stations of advertisement programmes, intended for this country, to which objection has been taken (114),&quot;
3.     The Cabinet Committee and the Cabinet approved recommendation (a), but decided in regard to (b) that &quot;sponsored&quot; items should not be allowed.     Recommendation (c) was also approved;    and the Foreign Office and the Post Office have continued to endeavour to secure international acceptance of the policy it indicates. Their endeavours have not, however, wholly achieved the object in view, and they have recently been subjected to some criticism.&apos; &apos;;:   &apos;-&apos; &apos;,;;;: .&apos;.     . ,4.     The decision to take what steps are possible to discourage advertisement broadcasting from abroad is a corollary of the attitude adopted towards the broadcasting of advertising matter at home.     That policy is of long standing and has gradually bocome more stringent;     Straight advertising was forbidden under the terms of the licence granted to the British Broadcasting Corporation in 1927;   and though the broadcasting of sponsored items was permissible, subject to certain limitations, until the end of 1936, the Corporation took practically no advantage of the permission.     Since the 1st January, 1937, advertisement broadcasting in any form has to all intents and purposes been prohibited so far as the British Broadcasting Corporation is concerned.5.&apos; .   Experience elsewhere, especially in the United- &apos; &apos; &apos; . &apos; &apos;States, has long since demonstrated that there is much money to be made by Broadcast advertising;    and it was only to be expected that individuals in this country would endeavour to exploit the situation to their personal advantage.   This they do by arranging with foreign stations to broadcast advertisements in english
English on terms which afford them a handsome profit, apart from the large share of the revenue which accrues to the foreign Governments concerned. Endeavour has been made to abate this nuisance through the agency of the Council of the International Broadcasting Union - representing the principal broadcasting agencies - and the Conferences of the International Telecommunications Union, representing the Governments in whose countries those agencies operate.6.     The following resolution was passed by the Council of the International Broadcasting Union in May 1933:-&quot;The Council .... holds that the systematic diffusion of programmes or communications which are specially intended for listeners in another country and have been the subject of a protest by the broadcasting organisation or organisations of that country, constitutes an inadmissible act from the point of view of good international relations. It calls upon the members of the International Broadcasting Union to avoid such transmissions, which constitute an improper use of broadcasting; and it requests the Government Administrations which control broadcasting organisations not adhering to the Union, to take steps so far as may be possible with such organisations in order to induce them also to submit to these principles of good international understanding.&quot;7.     The efforts made to prevent broadcasting in English from the Continent to Great Britain have hitherto proved effective, except in the case of certain broadcasting agencies located in Prance and cf Radio Luxemburg which is under French control. Luxemburg is not a subscriber to the international radio agreements, but France is.    Representation addressed to the former proved of no avail.    France promised amendment, but has so far taken no effectivesteps
4.steps in the matter except in the case of the Government owned stations.8.     The present position is that substantial programmes in English containing advertising matter are broadcast daily by Radio Normandy (68 hours per weeK) and by Radio Luxemburg (50 hours per week), while shorter programmes are radiated by Radio Lyons (18 hours per week) and Post Parisien (9 hours per week).     There is also a daily broadcast of one hour&apos;s duration from an Irish station - Radio Eireann.9.     Radio Luxemburg and the French agencies work in close association with British companies, e.g., the International Broadcasting Company, Wireless Publicity Ltd. and Broadcast Advertising Ltd.     These companies tout for advertisements amongst British firms, arrange the programmes under cover of which the advertising matter is to be broadcast, and procure the broadcasting of these programmes through their French associates.10.    It is naturally a matter of some distress to the companies that they are dependent on a French group, and they made strenuous endeavours in the course of 1937 to extend the scope of their operations;    and broadcasting agencies in Austria, Denmark, Germany, Hungary, Iceland and Switzerland were approached, happily without result. .   The companies even went so far as to offer the Governments of Panama and Paraguay a share of the spoils in return for the licensing of a ship sailing under their flag which should lie off the coast of Britain, but outside its territorial waters, and discharge &quot;by wireless salvoes of advertising matter.     This more
5..to break the illicit French broadcasting ring also failed.     A similar move is now being made in the Principality of Liechtenstein (on the borders of Switzerland and Austria).11.      Early in 1938 a change of tactics became apparent.     Some of the British interests concerned-had apparently come to the conclusion that it might be possible to induce the Home Government to connive at their activities by offering to place at its disposal free, for purposes of culture or propaganda, a fraction of the broadcasting time which they hoped to obtain by taking over existing continental stations or arranging for the erection of new ones. What was asked for in return was not &quot;... direct approval or encouragement from H.M.Government&quot; but&quot;(1) that diplomatic representations on the part of H.M,Government to Foreign Governments against the establishment of any radio station which broadcasts in English may be discontinued;    and(2) that H.M.Government shall not oppose the allocation of wave lengths which might be used for this purpose at the International Conference.&quot;12.      Contemporaneously a campaign was launched with a view to developing an atmosphere conducive to the acceptance of these proposals.      Its catchwords are such phrases as &quot;A welcome aid to commerce&quot;, &quot;Wider diffusion of British culture&quot;, &quot;Culture comes to the &quot; listener by courtesy of commerce&quot;, &quot;The ,freedom of the air&quot; and &quot;Sponsored broadcasting must come&quot;.    It would be idle to deny that such phrases have an appeal, especially for those who have no knowledge of
\_.102 &apos; &apos;&apos; 6-13.      I have received a letter from Mr. R.J.G. Boothby. M.P., advocating this scheme, in which he says:&quot;I have received assurances of support for foreign broadcasting in English from members of all parties.     And I am quite certain that if the House of Commons knew that we were in a position to bring all the stations broadcasting in English under unified control, and to co-operate with the authorities in cultural and propaganda work, that support would be practically unanimous.     I do not want to raise the matter in debate if it can be avoided.&quot;I have also received through Sir Frank Sanderson., Bt., M.P., and a number of other Members, representations in favour of the present advertisement broadcasts from Radio Luxemburg and Radio Normandy.14.     On the other hand Mr. R.A.Butler, Sir Robert Q-ower, Lt. Col. John Mayhew, and other Members have forwarded to me letters from newspaper proprietors and other constituents protesting against the continuance of these broadcasts.     The Press has, of course, always been strongly opposed to the admission of any advertising element in broadcasting, whether at home or from abroad.15.     Notwithstanding the support given it by the press and in some other quarters, the Government&apos;s policy in relation to the broadcasting of advertising programmes from abroad is to-day being definitely challenged, and it seems expedient to examine the merits of that challenge, disregarding for the time being the interested motives of those who havef Ofit ST*fid.  it
. $ft16.     That advertisement broadcasting in some form has come to stay is unhappily probably true even so far as this country is concerned.    Experience in the United States shows that it has immense possibilities by comparison with which the present endeavours at the expense of this country of Radio Luxemburg and Radio Normandy are but feeble.     It seems inevitable that . more and more money should be attracted to the business, and there is reason to suppose that American interests are not blind to the possibilities of the situation in Great Britain.     A more severe attack from abroad is therefore to be anticipated, and it is perhaps too much to hope that international agreements and understandings will prevail indefinitely in these days against the power of a well-nigh inexhaustible purse.    Doubtless the British Broadcasting Corporation should be and could be stimulated to offer an energetic and constructive reply to the attack, and it has already begun to move in that direction;   but the Corporation would it is thought, be the first to admit that its programmes will never wholly displace sponsored programmes in the public favour.17.     The conclusion is thus reached that it may prove to be impossible to offer successful resistance to the movement indefinitely.     If that view be accepted it seems wise now to consider how the movement can be controlled, its disadvantages minimised and such advantages as it offers exploited to the public benefit.      I would suggest that this can best be attained by a vigorous reaffirmation ofexisting
8.existing policy in relation.to advertising broadcasts from abroad, coupled with an intimation that if and when sponsored broadcasting is conceived to be in the public interest it will be undertaken by the British Broadcasting Corporation under State control.18.     Further activity in the matter of broadcasting from abroad is lii-cely to be heavily discouraged by the threat of competition from at home.    It should be possible in this way to defer the evil day on which the broadcasting of advertising matter has to be permitted and so give the British Broadcasting Corporation more time in which to establish its present programme policy in the public favour.    If sponsored broadcasting proves irresistible in the long run, the British Broadcasting Corporation can be trusted to put it across in such a way as will least offend those to whom it is distasteful - as for example by the institution of a second and sponsored national programme - while the resultant revenue, instead of finding its way into the pockets of private persons, will be available for distribution between the State and the British &apos; Broadcasting Corporation.    It is relevant to recall that, with the decrease in the rate of increase of the revenue from licences and the steady growth in the expenditure on television, the margin of licence revenue available to the Exchequer is rapidly diminishing and may soon have disappeared.19.     To sum up - the policy which I recommend for approval by the Cabinet is as follows:-(a)
9.(a)  -the practice of excluding advertisementsfrom the hroadcasting service in this country should for the present he maintained;(h) ^tiie scheme submitted hy Mr. Boothby^. andany similar proposals which necessitate theapproval by H.M.Government of the practice of broadcasting advertisements in English from foreign stations, should he rejected;(c)    a suitable opportunity should be taken.   X,:&apos;&quot;&apos;:../&apos;.&apos;&apos;,&apos;: ;   *mto make a public statement that the Government is opposed to the broadcasting of advertisements in English from Continental stations and that if and when a sponsored broadcasting service is. conceived to be in the public interest the British Broadcasting Corporation will be requested to undertake such a service.(Intld.)
