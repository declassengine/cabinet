Printed for the Cabinet,   June 1938.SECRET. Copy No.CP. 146 (38).CABINET.THE POULTRY INDUSTRY.Joint Memorandum by Minister of A griculture and Fisheries and Secretary ofState for Scotland.THE position of the poultry industry has been the subject of representations, in&apos;Parliament and elsewhere, for some considerable time past, and the increasing difficulties that have faced egg producers during the last eighteen months or two years have strengthened the demands for Government action in one form or another. The problems of the industry have indeed now reached a stage when it has become urgently necessary to define the Governments attitude towards them.General.2. The output of the poultry industry in Great Britain in 1936-37 may be valued at  24-1 million, made up as follows: (  million.)England great and Wales. Scotland. Britain.Poultry       .........        5-5 0-3 5-8Eggs.&apos;...........       15-9 2-4 18-321-4 2-7 24-1The estimated value of the output of all agricultural and horticultural produce in Great Britain in 1936-37 was  261 million, so that the poultry industry accounted for about 9 per cent, of the total and appreciably more than the share of the three cereal crops.3. Production of eggs in Great Britain in 1937 represented about 52 per cent, of total United Kingdom supplies of eggs in shell; in 1934 it reached 60 per cent., but since then home production has declined and imports have increased. In the case of dead poultry some 66 per cent, of total United Kingdom supplies are produced in Great Britain.4. The keeping of poultry, on a commercial or a domestic scale, is general in all parts of the country, though in some areas (e.g., Lancashire) it is more&apos; extensive than in others. It is estimated that specialist poultry farmers account for about one-quarter of the total production of eggs, and that three-quarters of our home egg supplies are produced on general farms, including small holdings. Elocks of poultry, large or small, are to be found on practically every farm in the country. Indeed, poultry keeping is the most widespread of all branches of agriculture.   -
Rapid Post- War Expansion.5. Since the war there has been a remarkable expansion in the poultry-population in Great Britain, as the following figures show :  		(000&apos;s.)		England		Great	and Wales.	Scotland.	Britain.1921    ...	24,800	4,200	29,0001926    ...	36,600	5,000	41,6001931    ...	......      52,600	7.100	59.7001934    ...	......      61,300	8,100	69.4001937   ...	......      52,600	7,300	59,900This expansion was effected at a time when the ratio between egg prices and feeding costs was favourable to the egg producer, and when other branches of agriculture were already showing signs of a decline in prosperity. The ranks of the industry were swelled by large numbers of ex-service men, with a limited amount of capital for investment, who welcomed the opportunity provided by poultry farming for a healthy outdoor occupation.Difficulties of the Industry.6. After a time the industry began to experience very considerable difficulties, and this fact is reflected in the decline in the fowl population since 1934. For one thing, the egg-feed ratio became less favourable in consequenece of the substantial rise in feeding-stuffs prices a movement not confined to this country, but world-wide in scope. This difficulty, serious though it is, particularly to the specialist poultry farmer, may be regarded as of a temporary nature and should right itself in due course. The fundamental problems of the industry, and those for which remedial measures can and should be devised, arise from the heavy losses from disease in the poultry flocks and the lack of organisation in the marketing of eggs and poultry.Poultry Disease.7. The great importance of the disease problem has been forcibly revealed by the report of the Poultry Technical Committee, published last February. The Committee quote an estimate by the National Veterinary Medical Association that the loss from disease amounts to  4 million a year for adult laying-birds in England and Wales alone, and express the view that the incidence of mortality is one of the most vital factors affecting the prosperity of the industry They associate the present position with the unprecedented demand for stock, hatching eggs and day-old chicks in post-war years arising from the too rapid expansion of the poultry population under the stimulus of high egg prices. In an effort to meet this demand, unsound breeding methods have been resorted to, and stock of low vitality has permeated the industry, leading to the heavy incidence of mortality which is a common feature of poultry farming to-day. The Committee state that the position of the industry is one of emergency; they urge the necessity of immediate and drastic measures to cope with the position, and they recommend the appointment of a Poultry (Stock Improvement) Commission with power to control the distribution of breeding stock, hatching eggs and day-old chicks. The control would involve the compulsory registration of all &quot; distributors &quot; with power to remove from the register those found to be distributing unfit or diseased stock. Superimposed on this, a voluntary &quot;grading&quot; scheme for breeders, aiming at the production of high-quality stock, would be assisted by the provision of certain free services (e.c/.. &quot; blood testing &quot; of birds) and the granting of financial assistance by way of premiums. This assistance would be provided at the outset by the State, but it is suggested that the premiums in subsequent years might be on a diminishing scale and ultimately cease. The Committee also recommend : (a) that the Commission should be charged with the duty of preparing a scheme for the establishment of a progeny-testing station with a view to the production of the highest quality foundation stock of known history and character, the cost of this being borne by the State;
(b) that a station should be established for the investigation of the majordisease problems of the industry; and(c) that increased financial provision should be made for educational and advisory work among poultry-keepers.8. The Poultry Technical Committee have made out what appears to us to be a convincing case for action to deal with the problems of disease, and we are prepared to recommend legislation to give effect to a scheme of control on the lines suggested by the Committee. We may add that the Committee&apos;s recommen-dations have received almost universal support throughout the poultry industry.Marketing Organisation.9. The problem of marketing reform was investigated by the Reorganisation Commissions appointed in 1933 to prepare schemes for regulating the marketing of eggs and poultry in England and Wales and in Scotfand respectively. The schemes recommended by the Commissions were considered by the industry, hut for one reason or another progress towards the introduction of marketing reform has been slow. The regulation of marketing through a producers&apos; marketing board under the Agricultural Marketing Acts probably presents greater problems in the case of eggs than in that of any other product, the reason being that a considerable volume of production is in the hands of very large numbers of small producers. The leaders of the industry are very doubtful whether a marketing scheme could, in fact, be successfully operated, and have been reluctant to attempt to introduce one unless by so doing they could obtain from the Govern^ ment a promise of assistance in the form of the regulation of imports and direct financial assistance. . *10. After much discussion, the two principal organisations representing producers presented . in December last a joint report outlining a suggested marketing scheme. Briefly, the main object of the proposals is to regulate the marketing of eggs by standardising methods of grading and packing. The scheme outlined in the report is less ambitious than those prepared by the Reorganisation Commissions in that it does not contemplate the exercise of price-fixing powers; and the report makes it clear that the proposals are contingent upon (a) adequate financial assistance being forthcoming simultaneously with theintroduction of the scheme; and(b) the quantitative regulation of imports of eggs.A Single Organisation for Stock Improvement and. Regulation of Marketing.11. It seems desirable to consider stock improvement and marketing reform as complementary measures for dealing with the general problem of the poultry industry, and since the appointment of an independent Commission has beer-suggested to deal with stock improvement it appears to be worthy of consideration whether this Commission might not be entrusted with certain functions in the marketing field that might in other circumstances be exercised by a producers&apos; marketing board. Indeed, it seems to us that this course might have considerable advantages from several points of view. It may be assumed that there are approximately 500,000 individual poultry-keepers in Great Britain, many of whom are in a small way of business. The organisation of the marketing of eggs and poultry under a producers&quot; marketing scheme, involving the registration of, and the collection of levies from, so large a body of producers, would present a very formidable task. The marketing board would have certain disciplinary powers, but no financial control over the marketing operations of producers, and even if such a scheme were introduced the difficulties of administration would be so great that it might well prove impracticable to continue the scheme in satisfactory operation. Moreover, the purely regulatory functions suggested in the outline of a marketing scheme recently submitted to us could be exercised quite as well by a Commission as by a producers&apos; board; in fact, the standardisation-tion of grades, &amp;c, up to the point of final sale to the consumer could be more effectively carried out by an independent body. Finally, the distributive trade would be more readily disposed to accept a measure of control at the hands of an independent commission.
Recent Disctissions with the Industry.12. Producers. As already indicated above, we have been given to under-stand that the organisations representative of poultry-keepers strongly support the recommendations of the Poultry Technical Committee. In view of the fact that the recommendations involve a rigid control of the distribution of poultry stock it is, indeed, worthy of special remark that the organisations are most anxious that legislation should be introduced without delay to give effect to the proposals. These organisations are also agreeable to the suggestion that powers to secure marketing reform as well as stock improvement should be placed in the hands of a single body- an independent commission.13. Distributors. The various organisations concerned with the distribution of eggs have been consulted, and we understand (a) that they agree generally that there is need for improvement in the methods of marketing home produced eggs both at the wholesale and retail stage, and (6) that thejr consider that the desired improvement could be more appropriately and effectively secured through the medium of an independent commission rather than a producers&apos; board.Proposed Legislation.14. We accordingly propose that legislation should be introduced, as soon as circumstances permit, for the establishment of an Egg and Poultry Commission empowered, broadly, (a) to control the distribution of breeding stock, day-old chicks and hatching eggs, and (6) to regulate the marketing of eggs by the standardisation of grades, &amp;c, up to the point of final sale to the consumer.15. Provision would need to be made at the same time for the regulation of the marketing of dead poultry. Having regard to the need for further investigation into, and demonstration of, the best methods of grading and packing poultry, however, the Commission would be unlikely to exercise for some little while their powers in regard to poultry marketing.16. The Poultry Technical Committee estimated the annual cost of their proposals for stock control at  110.000. The exercise by the Commission of regulatory functions in the marketing field would increase the cost to some extent, but the total cost should not exceed, say,  125,000 per annum.17. In addition, we propose that a small sum of money should be made available for the assistance of egg and poultry producers in the following directions : (i) Loans  to  egg packing  stations  set up  by  producers&apos;   co-operativeorganisations, the loans to be free of interest for an initial period of, say, two years, in order to give the stations an opportunity to become firmly established. Such stations would afford a check on the charges made by private enterprises for the grading and packing of eggs, and would tend to relate the prices returned to producers to the prices ultimately charged to the consumer. In this connection, the Reorganisation Commi ssion for England and Wales expressed the view that, where convenient, ownership of packing stations by producers&apos; co-operative societies is to be encouraged, (ii) Grants to a small number of demonstration poultry packing stations. Progress towards efficient grading and packing has not been nearly so rapid in the case of dead poultry as in the case of eggs, and there is need for a good deal of educational work among producers. This could best be carried out by the demonstration of efficient methods at a few poultry packing stations.We do not anticipate that these proposals would require a sum of more than, say,  40-50,000 all told, most of which would be in the form of advances repayable with interest.18.   Apart from the above, there would be a limited expenditure on (i) a poultry research station, the capital cost of which was suggested by the Poultry Technical Committee as probably  20-30,000 and the annual cost  10-15,000;(ii) additional educational facilities; and
: (iii) a progeny testing station under a scheme to be prepared by the p. Commission : the Poultry Technical Committee thought this might require an initial capital outlay of  25.000 and maintenance expenditure of  5,000 a year.The Import Position.19. So far we have made no reference to imports of eggs and poultry. The following table shows imports into the United Kingdom in each of the past three years : Eggs in Shell-1-British        ... Foreign	1935. 00 gt. hunds. 4,816 14,951	1936. 00 gt. hunds. 4,708 19,901	1937. 00 gt. hunds. 3,621 21,111i;.:                Total	19,767	24,609	24,732Eggs not in Shell  British Foreign	00 cwt. 2 813	00 cwt. i 915	00 ewt. 3 915Total    .	815	922	918Dead Poultry .

(Eire is included in this freedom from duty as from the 19th May, 1938, under the recent Trade Agreement.)Imports from foreign countries are subject to duties at the following rates : Eggs in shell: Is. to Is. 9c?. per 120, according to weight (equivalent to an average of about 16 per cent, ad valorem).Per lb.Eggs not in shell  d.Liquid or frozen ...       ...       ...       ...      ...        \Dried whole       ...      ...      ...      ...      ...      2\Dried yolk ...............      1!Dried albumen    ...      ...      ...      ...      ...      2f(The average ad valorem incidence of the above duties is 10 per cent.)Per lb.:&quot;;        ..,  ... ;    , d. ,Poultry, dead  ...      ...      ...      ...      ......        3(equivalent to 35-40 per cent. ad valorem.)The proceeds of import duties on poultry products in 1937 were approxi-mately as follows :- Eggs in shell       ............      1,655,000Eggs not in shell......      ......        235,000Poultry, live and dead.........        684,000Application for Increased Duties.21. Some eighteen months ago the industry made applications to the Import Duties Advisory Committee for increased duties on imports of eggs in shell and table poultry. In concluding their report in July 1937 on the applications, the Committee said that they had been impressed by the evidence which had been put before them as to the difficulties of this industry, which they regarded as one of
substantial national importance, and particularly of the specialist producers, who were largely a post-war development and by whom the increase in feeding-stuff and other costs was felt with especial severity. But, nevertheless, they had reached the conclusion that the position could not be improved by &apos; any increase in the duties imposed under the Import Duties Act. It was, of course, outside the province of the Import Duties Advisory Committee to consider whether there was a case for giving the industry further assistance in a form other, than an increase in the existing import duties.A alternative Methods of A assistance.22. With the rejection of the applications for increased duties on imports, and with the maintenance of feeding-stuffs prices at an abnormally high level, there was renewed pressure for a measure of Government help for the poultry industry. As has already been mentioned, the proposals put forward for a market-ing scheme were contingent on the provision of adequate financial assistance and on the quantitative regulation of imports.Subsidy.23. The industry did not state specifically what measure of financial assistance they desired, but there is reason to believe that they had in mind a scheme that had been discussed early in 1937 for the payment of a subsidy of Is. 3d. per 120 eggs and 3d. per lb. on table poultry of prescribed quality standards passing through approved packing stations. In addition, the scheme envisaged the provision of financial assistance .Jor producer-owned packing-stations and for advertising home-produced potfltry products. The total cost of the scheme in question may be put at something of the order of  2 million a year, the bulk of which would be distributed in the form of subsidy to producers.24. Another proposal put forward by the industry is for the payment of subsidy on first quality eggs passing through approved channels of sale sufficient to maintain a fixed relationship between returns to the producer and the cost of feeding-stuffs. A further proposal is for a subsidy varying according to the market price of eggs, to maintain producers&apos; returns at a prescribed minimum during the flush period in the spring when egg prices are at their lowest level; the cost of a proposal of this kind would depend on the course of market prices and on the minimum aggregate return to be maintained, but on the basis of egg-prices in the spring months of recent years and a minimum return of, say, 11s. Qd. per 120 eggs, the cost would be between  1 and  2 million a year.25. A subsidy for egg production to the poultry industry, however, would not only present serious administrative difficulties, but would in present circum-stances, in all probability, defeat its own object.26. The needs of the two main classes of producer, the specialist on the one hand, and the general farmer on the other, are different. While specialist producers as a whole are no doubt being hit hard by the rise in the price of feeding-stuffs and other costs, it is probably true to say that production is still being carried on at a profit, if only a small one, by general farmers of reasonable efficiency unless they are suffering from the effects of disease among their flocks.27. The present difficulties of the industry follow, and are in part a consequence of, a period of boom and rapid expansion. Between 1921 and 1934 the numbers of poultry rose from 29 millions to nearly 70 millions, and egg production from about 1,500 millions to well over 4,000 millions, as a result of a very favourable ratio between egg prices and feeding costs, and large numbers of inexperienced and inefficient producers entered the industry. It was inevitable that there should be some setback when the price of feeding-stuffs rose and the exceptionally favourable conditions which had led to the boom passed away. A subsidy, which would have the effect of maintaining through difficult times the inefficient producer who entered the industry in time of boom, even if it could be justified in principle, would not in the long run be to the advantage of the industry as a whole.28. Moreover, a subsidy given to this industry in present circumstances could hardly be so adjusted as merely to maintain production at the existing level. It wpuld almost inevitably lead to a further expansion, which, if there was a fall
substantial national importance, and particularly of the specialist producers, who were largely a post-war development and by whom, the increase in feeding-stuff and other costs was felt with especial severity. But, nevertheless, they had reached the conclusion that the position could not be improved by any increase in the duties imposed under the Import Duties Act. It was, of course, outside the province of the Import Duties Advisory Committee to consider whether there was a case for giving the industry further assistance in a form other than an increase in the existing import duties.A alternative Methods of A assistance.22. With the rejection of the applications for increased duties on imports, and with the maintenance of feeding-stuffs prices at an abnormally high level, there was renewed pressure for a measure of Government help for the poultry industry. As has already been mentioned, the proposals put forward for a market-ing scheme were contingent on the provision of adequate financial assistance and on the quantitative regulation of imports.Subsidy.23. The industry did not state specifically what measure of financial assistance they desired, but there is reason to believe that they had in mind a scheme that had been discussed early in 1937 for the payment of a subsidy of Is. 3d. per 120 eggs and 3d. per lb. on table poultry of prescribed quality standards passing through approved packing stations. In addition j the scheme envisaged the provision of financial assistance ^for producer-owned packing-stations and for advertising home-produced poultry products. The total cost of the scheme in question may be put at something of the order of  2 million a year, the bulk of which would be distributed in the form of subsidy to producers.24. Another proposal put forward by the industry is for the payment of subsidy on first quality eggs passing through approved channels of sale sufficient to maintain a fixed relationship between returns to the producer and the cost of feeding-stuffs. A further proposal is for a subsidy varying according to the market price of eggs, to maintain producers&apos; returns at a prescribed minimum during the flush period in the spring when egg prices are at their lowest level; the cost of a proposal of this kind would depend on the course of market prices and on the minimum aggregate return to be maintained, but on the basis of egg-prices in the spring months of recent years and a minimum return of^ say, 11s. 6d. per 120 eggs, the cost would be between  1 and  2 million a year.25. A subsidy for egg production to the poultry industry, however, would not only present serious administrative difficulties, but would in present circum-stances, in all probability, defeat its own object.26. The needs of the two main classes of producer, the specialist on the one hand, and the general farmer on the other, are different. While specialist producers as a whole are no doubt being hit hard by the rise in the price of feeding-stuffs and other costs, it is probably true to say that production is still being carried on at a profit, if only a small one, by general farmers of reasonable efficiency1 unless they are suffering from the effects of disease among their flocks.27. The present difficulties of the industry follow, and are in part a consequence of, a period of boom and rapid expansion. Between 1921 and 1934 the numbers of poultry rose from 29 millions to nearly 70 millions, and egg production from about 1,500 millions to well over 4,000 millions, as a result of a very favourable ratio between egg prices and feeding costs, and large numbers of inexperienced and inefficient producers entered the industry. It was inevitable that there should be some setback when the price of feeding-stuffs rose and the exceptionally favourable conditions which had led to the boom passed away. A subsidy, which would have the effect of maintaining through difficult times the inefficient producer who entered the industry in time of boom, even if it could be justified in principle, would not in the long run be to the advantage of the industry as a whole. L28. Moreover, a subsidy given to this industry in present circumstances could hardly be so adjusted as merely to maintain production at the existing level. It wpuld almost inevitably lead to a further expansion, which, if there was a fall
in the price of feeding-stuffs, might become rapid, since egg production is capable of being increased very quickly and with comparatively little capital expenditure. The present marginal producer, raised by the subsidy to profitable production, would soon be replaced.by other marginal producers. The result would be a glut, falling prices and demands for still further assistance required for the expanded industry.29. Further, the only practicable method of distributing a subsidy would presumably be through the medium of licensed wholesale dealers. It would be a matter of some difficulty to ensure that payments made to wholesale dealers were, in fact, passed back to the producers; and a substantial proportion of our total egg production does not pass through the wholesale trade, and would not, there-fore, receive the benefit of the subsidy.30. The claim to direct financial assistance cannot be pressed on the ground that the industry has not been given the benefit of tariff protection, for there are already fairly substantial duties on imports of eggs and poultry from foreign countries, which are the home producers&apos; main competitors apart from imports from Eire, which are to be subject to regulation. In any case the difficulties of the industry are not due normally to imports; they arise chiefly from heavy losses due to disease and from the lack of organisation in the marketing field.31. . We recognise that the claims of the poultry industry to direct financial assistance command a large measure of sympathy and support, both in Parliament and in the country, and if help is denied to the poultry-keeper there will undoubtedly be a good deal of disappointment and possibly resentment in some quarters. But after careful consideration of all the circumstances and for the reasons indicated above, we do not feel justified in recommending any scheme of direct subsidy. If, however, the measures we propose in this memorandum should prove inadequate to enable the efficient producer to show a reasonable profit on his operations, the question of a subsidy might have to be reconsidered.Quantitative Regulation of Imports.32. There remains for consideration the question of assisting the industry by the quantitative regulation of imports. In that connection we may say at once that we do not propose that imports should be restricted with the object of raising the normal levels of prices in this country. Any such proposal would be strenuously opposed by distributors. Moreover, an appreciable improvement in prices could be effected only by a very substantial reduction in imports, and the benefit to the home industry would quickly be offset by the increased production that would be encouraged. On the other hand, we do suggest that powers to regulate imports should be reserved for use in certain special circumstances, outlined below : (a) Emergency A ction. The Reorganisation Commission for Eggs and Poultry for Great Britain, which reported in December 1935, expressed the view that it might be necessary to retain quantitative regulation as the last line of defence not only of the marketing scheme, but of the home industry itself, in the event of excessive imports threatening to overwhelm the market. Conditions such as the Commission had in mind did, in fact, occur during the winter of 1936-37. Owing to the exceptionally large arrivals from the Continent, due probably to the mild weather, imports of eggs in December 1936 were as much as 50 per cent, greater than the level of the preceding years, and, in consequence, the index number of egg prices fell from 106 in December to 95 in the following month. The situation thus created was serious for the home producer and the industry claims at least to be protected from such sudden flooding of the market. We consider that the claim to protection against abnormal importations which lead to instability in the market is reasonable and justifiable, and we accordingly propose that power should be reserved to regulate imports in an emergency of this kind.(b) Regulation in Conjunction with Storage of Home Produce. The Reorganisation Commission for Eggs and Poultry for England and Wales suggested that if an egg^marketing scheme were introduced, the marketing board might consider the storage of a quantity of eggs during the spring flush period for release during the autumn, the object being to modifj&apos; to some extent the extreme seasonal variations of market supplies and prices.    The Great Britain
Commission subsequently recommended that if this suggestion were acted upon there should be a complementary seasonal regulation of imports to ensure that the beneficial effects of the storage operations were not prejudiced by increased supplies from overseas. Although it is not now suggested that a producers&apos; marketing board should be.established, it is quite possible that proposals for. the spring storage of eggs may be promoted at some time in the future, e.g., by an organisation of egg packing stations. The adoption by the industry or any section of it of a constructive policy of this kind should, we feel, be encouraged and we accordingly suggest that power should be reserved to regulate imports on the lines recommended by the Reorganisation Commission.Treaty Position.33. Dominions. Under existing Agreements we have reserved the right, in consultation with the Governments concerned, to bring imports of eggs and poultry from the &quot; Ottawa &quot; Dominions within the scope of any general scheme for the quantitative regulation of supplies from all sources in the United Kingdom market. The Dominions were, however, informed in November last, as part of the revised arrangements between them and the United Kingdom arising from the United States negotiations, that quantitative regulation would be imposed on these products only if imports were such as to lead to instability in the market for those products in the United Kingdom. The new Agreement with Eire relieved imports from that Dominion of their previous liability to duties, but it provides safeguards against any undue increase in such supplies, initially by export control by the Eire Government, or. if necessary, by quantitative regulation or import duties imposed by the United Kingdom Government.34. Foreign Countries. In our Agreements with Denmark and other foreign countries we have undertaken not to regulate the quantity of imports of eggs except in so far as may be necessary to secure the effective operation of a scheme for the regulation of the marketing of domestic supplies. In the event of legislation being introduced on the lines suggested in this memorandum, it might reasonably be argued that the exercise of the marketing functions of the Poultry Commission would justify the introduction of import regulation under the terms of the Trade Agreements with foreign countries.Summary of Proposals.35. We propose that legislation be introduced as soon as convenient to provide for the following matters in relation to the poultry industry :  The establishment of an independent Poultry Commission with powrers (a) to control the distribution of breeding stock, hatching eggs, and day-oldchicks;(b) to regulate the marketing of eggs and poultry by the standardisation ofgrading, packing, &amp;c, up to&quot; the point of final sale to the consumer;(c) to deal with matters of detail ancillary to the above functions.The quantitative regulation of imports of eggs (and other poultry products) where necessary : (a) to safeguard the home industry against unstable market conditions resulting from excessive arrivals from overseas;(6) to safeguard any operations that may be undertaken by the home industry, by storage during the spring flush, with a view to modifying the extreme seasonal variations of supplies and prices.We also propose that financial provision should be made for :  (a) a progeny-testing station, additional research into problems of poultrymortality and additional educational and advisory work amongst poultry-keepers;(b) loans to assist egg packing stations set up by producers&apos; co-operative societies and grants to demonstration poultry packing stations.The cost of the Commission is not expected to exceed  125,000 a year, to which has to be added a sum of, say,  40- 50,000 all told for loans and grants to egg and poultry packing stations, a capital expenditure of  45- 55,000 and
an annual expenditure of  15- 20,000 for the establishment of a progeny-testing station and a poultry research station, and a further small sum to cover additional facilities for education.We commend these proposals to our colleagues as a sound and balanced policy for the poultry industry. After the most careful consideration we are satisfied that they represent the least that can reasonably be proposed to meet the industry&apos;s difficulties.We should be glad to receive authority to make an early statement of the Governments policy.W. S. M. J. C.June 23, 1938.
