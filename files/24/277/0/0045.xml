ii O &quot;at(c)    That the Minister for Co-ordination.of Defence should in the meanwhile arrange for a re-examination of the report by the appropriate Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence, in the light of General von Reichen.au&apos;s statement.&quot;k 55 H S 55s Cabinet 31(38), &amp;     Cabinet 156(38)-1-SECRET. iCP. 164(38). COPY NO.cabinet, BRITISH MILITARY MISSION TO PORTUGAL.Memorandum by the Minigtejpjfor Co-ordination of IPefenWgT&apos;&quot;My colleagues will recall that at the Meeting   held on 6th July, 1938, the Cabinet had under consideration a Memorandum by the Foreign Office on the subject of the British Militar3r Mission to Portugal, together with relevant extracts from the draft Minutes of the 528th Meeting of the Committee of Imperial Defence,^     The Cabinet were informed that the report of a speech made by General von Reichenau, which had recently been communicated by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to the Service Ministers, had a bearing on the subject under discussion,2. The Cabinet agreed -&quot;(a)    To postpone further consideration of CP. 156(38) until the next regular meeting of the Cabinet
3. In accordance with, (c)  above, I convened ameeting of the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee at which I presided, and invited Sir Alexander Cadogan to take part in our deliberations.After a. full discussion the Chiefs of Staff suggested, and I agreed, that as political as well, as strategical questions were involved it would be more appropriate for me to circulate a Memorandum summarising our joint views than for the Chiefs of Staff to render a report in the normal manner,4. It was suggested that it was relevant to knowsomething about General von Eeichenau, the author of the statement j, which we were asked to examine 0     We were informed that he commands the 4th Army Group at Leipzig, Unlike many other German General Officers, he is a firm supporter of the Nazi regime, has the reputation of being ambitious and actuated mainly by political self--interest. With reference to the statement itself, the Chiefs of Staff were agreed that it revealed no new or startling features with regard to German political and strategic aims and that it was just such a speech as a Director of Military Operations might make to the Staff College, Nevertheless our discussion illustrated the importance on the one hand attached by Germany to plans for getting Portugal into their orbit and to the importance on our part of preventing Portugal from corning under German influence, and affording bases for German operations against us.5, As to this, I would remind my colleagues that abouta year ago, the Chiefs of Staff recorded^ the followingK   Circulated as C UPU163 (38)t&amp;    G.I. D.  Paper No,  1336-B, paragraph 12,-2-
9q q a oconclusion in regard to the importance of Anglo- &quot; Portuguese relations from the strategical point of view:-&quot;(a)35 H 55 H hWe conclude that the importance of maintaining our alliance with Portugal has increased with the development of air power, owing to the fact that, from the air point of view, the Mother Country and her Island possessions in the Eastern Atlantic are admirably situated, either for the defence of or attack on our seaborne trade0We cannot forecast the outcome of the Spanish Civil War, but since a return to the old and innocuous regime appears unlikely, It may well be that the availability of facilities and anchorages in Portuguese waters, alternative to Gibraltar, will prove of greater value to our navy in the future than in the pasteElsewhere, in Africa and the Par East, it is important that no strong Foreign Power should be permitted to develop a predominant influence in Portuguese territory.Prom every aspect,therefore, we confirm the view that the maintenance of our alliance with Portugal is of great importancea&quot;6. This conclusion was approved by both the Committeeof Imperial Defence&quot; and the Cabinet/7. Nothing has happened to detract from the conclusions reached a year ago:    in fact, the Chief of Naval Staff reinforced them at our meeting by pointing out that, if the Mediterranean was closed to us in time of war, and our trade to India and the Par East had to be routed via the Cape, Portugal and Portuguese Possessions would assume an even added strategic   importance08. That our efforts to keep Portugal within our orbithave not hitherto been too successful is clear from the discussion^ which took place in the Committee of Imperial Defence on the 30th June.     The suggestion of the Head of the British Military Mission that His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Lisbon should hold more persuasive language to Dr.Salazar would not, it was thought, lead us much further unless he were authorised to make some concrete offerx C.I.D.

of assistance either in the form of an undertaking to despatch military and/or air forces to Portugal in the event of her being attacked,  or in the form of an early and adequate compliance with his urgent requirements in guns.9. As to the question of promising armedassistance for Portugal in the event of her being attacked,  it is clear that we could not undertake to help with land forces.      The position as regards air force reinforcements is however rather a different one and in this connection it v/ill be recalled that the Head of the British Military Mission suggested that an offer of assistance by British air forces would he a valuable card to play at this juncture.      This suggestion was mentioned in the course of the discussion by the Committee of Imperial Defence on the 30th June (C.I.D. Minutes,  328th Meeting, page 8) when the Chief of the Air Staff expressed the view that &quot;any assurances of this nature would be in the form of a contingent commitment&quot;.      We have thought it right to explore this proposition in greater detail.10.        The position appears to be as follows. If, as we believe, Dr. Salazar&apos;s fears of attack from Spain are exaggerated, there would be little likelihood that we should be called upon to implement our promise.      If,  on the other hand, Portugal were attacked on her land frontier, we should in any case have to go to her assistance, not only &apos;in Portuguese interests but also in our own.
-  9 Q 0*j a o11.      In all the circumstances it was agreed that I should suggest that Sir v/alter Selby should approach Dr. Salazar as already proposed &quot;by the Committee of Imperial Defence and should in addition propose the giving of an assurance that, provided the circumstances at home permit, ?/e should be pre-pared to assist Portugal with air forces in time of war.    If his reactions to this proposal are favourable, His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador might go on to suggest that this question should form the subject of discussion by the British hilitary Mission, who should concert their views with the Portuguese Authorities as to the possible scale of attack on Portugal and the air forces required to meet it, together with aerodrome and other necessary facilities.12.      Such an offer of assistance by air forces would not onlybe to the benefit of Portugal but might, in fact, fit in withour own requirements, since air forces based in Portugal could operate as a counter to activities of air forces (Spanish^ German or Italian) operating from bases in Spanish territory against the interests of ourselves9 e.g, Gibraltar or shipping5 or our allies^ .13.      If the above proposal is accepted in principle, it would of course be necessary to issue such instructions to the Mission as would ensure that their discussions proceed on correct lines, and that they do not involve us in any definite commitment.14.      There is no doubt, however, that at the present time the problem of the re-armament of his country looms large in Dr.  Salazar&apos;s mind and it will be noted that at the 328th Meeting of the Commit&apos;cee of Imperial Defence the following conclusions were reached -&quot;THE COMMITTEE OP IMPERIAL DEFENCE agreed -(a) That no further concession with regardto the supply of armaments to Portugal, over and above those already approved by the Cabinet, could be recommended;(b) That in any further negotiation on thesubject of Portuguese armament orders nothing should be said that might tend to alienate Dr. Salazar&apos;s goodwill towards us.&quot;
The present position is that we have offered to make token deliveries to Portugal of 3.7&quot; and 3.45&quot; guns, commencing with delivery of 4 - 5.7&quot; guns in the Spring of 1939 and 4 - 3.45&quot; guns at the end of that year,15* With regard to the 3,45&quot; guns, none of these weapons are yet in production and there is no prospect of making an earlier delivery than that already contemplated.     The same considerations however do not apply to the 3.7&quot; guns which are now coming into production in increasing numbers. We could, in fact make an early token delivery of sufficient of these equipments to satisfy Portuguese requirements for training but, as has been so frequently pointed out, this could only be done at the expense of the air defence of Great Britain. I need hardly remind my colleagues that the 3.7&quot; gun situation is much in the public mind at the moment and although the despatch of two or three equipments for training purposes would not appreciably affect the security of the United Kingdom, there are strong political arguments against dissipating even so small a portion of our modern anti-aircraft defence at the present time.16. On the whole, however, my suggestion, withwhich the Chiefs of Staff are in agreement, is that if the offer by Sir Walter Selby of an assurance of assistance by air forces in addition to naval forces in time of war fails to influence Dr. Salazar in a favourable direction, our Ambassador should be empowered to throw out the suggestion, on his own
authority, that His Majesty&apos;s Govemraent might possibly be prepared to make earlier delivery of the four 3,7&quot; training equipments.17. -    There is one final point which I put forward for consideration more in relation to future than present policy.      It will be recalled that at the meeting held on the 11th May,  the Cabinet agreed -55 55 Hz&quot;(b) That there appeared to be no justification for departing from the ordinary rules of good finance or for entertaining suggestions such as that Portugal should purchase the guns in question by making deferred payment. If however the Portuguese insisted in making deferred payment in some form as a condition of the acceptance of our offer the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence should again bring this cuestion before the Cabinet for further consideration,,&quot;18.       I feel that this :lu a matter where, other things being equal, we have an opportunity of exploiting our relatively, strong financial position. Although it is realised that Portugal is not in straitened financial circumstances and could probably well afford to pay cash for her armaments,  if some system of deferred payments would turn the scale between keeping Portugal within our own orbit or the partial stirrender of our position to Germany, then in view of the importance attached by the Chiefs of Staff to the maintenance of the Anglo-Portuguese alliance I recommend that such financial concession should be made.(mtld9)     ToWoHoI.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.I., 11th July, 1938.
