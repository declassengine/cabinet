THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT..SECRET. COPY NO._CP. ISO (58).CABINET. REORGANISATION OF THE COTTON INDUSTRY. Memorandum &quot;by the President of the Board of Trade.In December last, I reported /C.P.304(37J7 tne proposals that had been submitted to me by the Joint Committee of Cotton Trade Organisations for the reorganisation of their industry^ I was then authorised to inform the Committee that while the Government appreciated the efforts that had been made, and recognised in the proposals a genuine endeavour to meet the criticisms and suggestions that had been made in the past, certain important questions of policy remained still to be settled;     and that the Government hoped that the necessary consultations would continue with all possible speed in order that (provided these points were settled to the satisfaction of the Government) it might be possible to proceed with the drafting of a Bill.These questions were first, the definitions essential to an understanding of the scope of the scheme;    secondly, the methods by which it was intended that the scheme should assist the export trade;    and thirdly (though not in the same category of urgency), the main outlines envisaged for the schemes co\ ;ring individual sections of the industry and the procedure for giving statutory effect to them.In February, the Committee submitted to me a revised-----       edition of their proposals of which a copy is attached to thismemorandum.      They also indicated that they contemplated assisting export trade by giving the Cotton Industry Board
power to authorise exceptions from minimum prices, etc.  in sectional schemes for goods going to particular markets when an Export Trade Development Committee recommended that reductions in prices were necessary.      They admitted, however, that they had not yet been able to settle the lines of demarcation between the interests to be included in the scheme and other textile interests, of which the chief are the wool textile and the rayon industries.     They further informed me that they had come to the conclusion that it would be impossible at this stage to define the individual sections of the industry.      They believed that this task could only be accomplished satisfactorily after the Cotton Industry Board, envisaged by the proposals, had been set up.I told the Committee that I attached the greatest importance to the definition of the industry as a whole, and that it would be impossible for the Government to take any further action until the position in regard to it had been clarified either by the formulation of agreed lines of demarcation with the wool textile and the rayon industries or by the establishment of a definite disagreement with either or both of these industries.      They promised to push forward their discussions as quickly as possible, and on the 3rd March they reported to me that in neither case had they &quot;been able to reach agreement.    On receipt of this information, I invited the two industries to state their objections to me and I subsequently discussed the position with representatives of each of them.     Briefly,   &quot;both industries wished to have nothing to do with the scheme and wanted it to &quot;be framed so that their members and a large section of the users of their materials were not included in it.I communicated the result of ray enquiries to the Joint Committee and asked them to make a further attempt to reach agreement with the allied industries.      They replied that they could not accept the position taken up by either industry as a
reasonable basis of discussion and that they saw no hope, as things were, of anything tangible resulting from further negotiations..      They added that so long as this question of definition was regarded as a bar to further action by the Government, it would be impossible to make any progress with the representatives of the allied interests, since these, by maintaining their present attitude, could hold up the scheme indefinitely.      They urged that the Government should declare itself in favour of the general principles embodied in the proposals and should proceed to the drafting of a Bill, on the understanding that any approach to Parliament should be dependent on the settlement of the outstanding points to the satisfaction of the Government and on substantial support being forthcoming for the measure.After a considerable discussion, in which I emphasised that to succeed at all the Bill must secure the assent of the great bulk of those to be affected by it, I agreed to lay the position before my. colleagues.    I pointed out, however, that if the Government were prepared to accede to their request it would fall to my lot to define the scope of the industry.      In doing so, I should do my best to be fair to all concerned;    and they must not assume that the line I should draw would favour their standpoint at the expense of those other industries who felt strongly that they had legitimate interests to protect.The present position is altogether unsatisfactory.      The negotiations between the Joint Committee and the wool textile and. rayon industries have definitely broken down and, in the absence of any step by the Government, I see no prospect of their successful resumption.      Considerable opposition to the scheme exists in Lancashire itself.      The leaders of this opposition have expressed to me their fears that the application of the Joint Committee&apos;s proposals as they stand must lead to a decline in efficiency and enterprise, and a definite weakening of the
capacity of the industry to retain any hold on competitive markets..      They claim that so far they have received support in their opposition from something like a quarter of the firms in the industry,     Prom a conversation I have had with them however I gather that the opponents are not entirely opposed to all the features of the Joint Committee&apos;s proposals.     They would not object strongly to redundancy schemes though some of them would prefer instead that capital should be made available for replacement of old plant by a smaller quantity of new plant. Nor would their objection extend to all proposals for enforcing minimum prices.      They claim, however, that such prices should not exceed the price which an independent accountant certifies to be the minimum price which would yield a reasonable profit to an efficient concern working to capacity, a condition that would probably not be acceptable to all the supporters of the Joint Committee&apos;s proposals.     The opponents feel, however, that discussions between them and the Joint Committee would at this stage have no useful result.A position of deadlock has therefore arisen in the industries concerned.      In the meantime, conditions in the cotton industry have steadily deteriorated during the last six months and it is now in a state of serious depression which shows no sign of lifting.      In these circumstances, if we continue to insist that no progress can be made until agreement has been reached on the scope of the scheme in relation to the allied textile industries, the deadlock will continue and we shall be accused - and not wholly without justification - of doing nothing to foster the first real attempt at co-operation in the industry that has yet been put-forward.      That is a position that I do not feel we can face, and as an attempt to break the present deadlock and to clarify the attitude towards the scheme of all the interests affected I should propose action on the following lines.
I should like the authority of rny colleagues to proceed now to the drafting of a Bill on the general lines of the Committee&apos;s proposals, modified wherever necessary in order to get the maximum of agreement.      In the absence of any agreement on the subject, it would be necessary for me to take the responsibility for framing a definition of the scope of the scheme that would be fair to all the interests concerned.      I should also like to have discretion to omit from the Bill any features of the proposals which were likely to raise unusual difficulties and in any event consultation with the Treasury and the Ministry of Labour would be necessary in regard to the proposals for Exchequer contributions (whether of the kind referred to in the Joint Committee&apos;s proposals or for a scrap and build scheme) and the legalisation of wage agreements.      I do not underrate the difficulties of this task and appreciate that in the result I may not succeed in pleasing either the promoters or the opponents.      I should therefore propose to make a further effort to induce the different sections in Lancashire as well as the other industries concerned to sit down together (possibly under the Chairmanship of some person who has not previously taken any active part in the controversy but who might be expected to command the confidence of the industry) to try to reach some greater measure of agreement.      It is, I fear, unlikely that anything like complete agreement could be reached in that way but the result of such discussions should at least assist me in producing a Bill that would command as wide a measure of support as it is possible to obtain.This procedure, moreover, would show that the Government was ready to support the efforts of the cotton industry to put its house in order;   but in publishing the draft Bill it would be made plain that it was put forward as a basis of discussion, and that further progress would depend on evidence being available that a Bill on these lines (with such modifications
as might &quot;be shown to &quot;be necessary) would command that substantial measure of support without which it could not be expected to accomplish the. objects in view.      If this were done, I believe that it would be possible for the different industries and the individual firms affected to appreciate more clearly their position under the scheme and to make known their considered views in regard to it.      It would then be possible fo the Government to decide whether to proceed with the measure.O.F.G. S.Board of Trade, May,  1938.
PROPOSALS FOR ACOTTON INDUSTRY ENABLING   BILLSubmitted toTHE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF trade by theJOINT   COMMITTEE   OF COTTON    TRADE   ORGANISATIONS
The Joint Committee of Cotton Trade Organisations on February 15, 1938, unanimously decided to submit these proposals to the President of the Board of Trade, with a request for legislation at the earliest possible date.All the organisations represented on the Joint Committee supported the decision,1 on the understanding that the Bill would follow the lines of the proposals, and that the memo-randum of instructions to be handed to the Chairman of the Cotton Industry Board on appointment (clause 9) would be seen and approved by the representative organisations of the industry. -The following recommendation of the Executive was unanimously endorsed: &quot;In order to ensure the efficient working of the pro-posed Cotton Industry Board it is most desirable that the Board should be small in numbers, and should not exceed a chairman and 12 members.&quot;It should be made clear in the terms of appointment that members of the Board are to regard themselves as custodians of the interests of the whole industry and not as representatives of any particular section.&quot;Provision should be made for the views of individual sections to reach the Cotton Industry Board through the representative organisations of each section, who should be assured of the right of direct access both to the Cotton Industry Board and to the independent Advisory Committee.&quot;It is desirable, however, that on questions affecting the industry as a whole the Cotton Industry Board should have the means of ascertaining opinion in the industry generally, and for this purpose it is recommended that the Joint Committee of Cotton Trade Organisations, with such changes of constitution as may be necessary, should become a representative advisory council, to be consulted by the Cotton Industry Board on all general questions.&quot;(&apos;) Subject to a request by the Master Packers&apos; Association and the Joint Board of Inside Warehouse Workers (representing employees in the packing section) that &quot;making-up and packing&quot; should be brought within the scope of the Bill.
. ,i.  Proposals submitted to the Board of Trade as a basis for aCOTTON INDUSTRY ENABLING   BILLCOTTON INDUSTRY BOARD1. With a view to the better organisation and greater efficiency of the cotton industry in Great britain and the development of the export trade in cotton and allied textiles2, the Board of Trade should have power to appoint a Cotton Industry Board, consisting of a Chairman and twelve other members.2. The Chairman should be appointed by the Board of Trade after consultation with persons appearing to the Board of Trade to be representative of all sections of the cotton industry, including the operatives engaged in the cotton industry, and the other members, after consultation with persons appearing to the Board of Trade to represent :-In respect of Two members, employers in the spinning section of the industry ;One member, operatives in the spinning section of the industry;Two members, employers in the weaving section of the industry;One member, operatives in the weaving section of the industry;One member, employers in the bleaching section of the industry ;(&apos;)   Separate legislation will probably be required for Northern Ireland. (*)   The extent to which allied textiles are affected by the Bill is set out in paragraph 13 below.
One member, employers in the dyeing section of the industry ;One member, employers in the printing section of the industry;One member, operatives in the finishing section of the industry ;Two members, merchants wholly or mainly engaged in the distribution of cotton and allied textiles produced in Great Britain.3. Provision would have to be made, possibly in a schedule to the Bill, for the constitution, remuneration (if any) and incidental functions of the Cotton Industry Board.POWERS OF THECOTTON INDUSTRY BOARD4.. The main functions of the Cotton Industry Board would be : (i) To determine and define the various sections of the cotton industry, in consultation with the representative organisations concerned.(ii) To examine and if it approves them to recommend to the Board of Trade schemes for the better organi-sation and greater efficiency of the cotton industry in Great Britain or of any section or sections of the cotton industry, subject to the provisions set out below (paragraphs 15 to 19).The Cotton Industry Board should also have power itself to formulate and to recommend any scheme affecting the industry generally, subject to the provisions of paragraph 19, and to approve marketing schemes (paragraph 23).
(iii) . To perform, in relation to such schemes after theyhave come into operation, such functions in regard to their working and administration as may be entrusted to the Board by the provisions of the Bill or the terms of the scheme, and to supervise voluntary schemes on the request of the section or sections concerned.(iv) To promote the interests of the cotton industry in general, and to co-operate with other persons or organisations to that end.5. In order to carry out its functions properly, the Cotton Industry Board should keep registers of firms and persons carrying on business in the cotton industry as defined in the Bill, and have power to charge a registration fee approved by the Board of Trade.6. The Board should also have power, with the approval of the sections concerned, to impose for the purposes specified in paragraph 19 such levies as may be approved by the Board of Trade on all firms coming within the scope of the Bill. Provision, to be made for a maximum rate of levy and for Treasury grants on a pound for pound basis for such schemes as may be recommended to the Treasury by the Board of Trade.7. In order to satisfy itself that schemes submitted to it are not likely to injure the interests of any section or adversely to affect the export trade, and in view of its responsibility for supervising schemes in operation, the Board should have power to obtain information from all firms and persons coming within the scope of the Bill with regard to productive capacity, output, orders, sales, deliveries, stocks and costs, or such other information as the Board may require.1(&apos;) Provision will be made to guard against the disclosure of informa-tion relating to individual firms. Employees or agents of the C.I.B. would be prohibited from disclosing such information, even-to members of the Board. The information supplied to the Board would be in the form of aggregates or averages.
8. The Board should have power, in the event of failure to achieve the desired object by negotiation with the section or sections concerned, to recommend to the Board of Trade the suspension or termination of any scheme or part of a scheme which is operating inequitably or adversely affecting the interests of any other section or sections, and the Board of Trade should have power to act on such recom-mendation.9. The general procedure to be followed by the Cotton Industry Board in examining schemes submitted for approval, and in supervising schemes actually in operation, would be governed by the provisions of the Bill, but it is suggested that the Board of Trade should furnish the Chairman of the Cotton Industry Board on appointment with a Memorandum setting out the principles by which the Board is to be guided before approving schemes or in formulating general schemes under paragraph 19. (This would be drawn up after con-consultations between producers and distributors.)10. The Cotton Industry Board should set up from among its members, but with power to co-opt persons with suitable special knowledge, an Export Development Committee, to examine or formulate, in the light of representations from registered merchants or other sections of the industry, or as the result of the market research undertaken by the Cotton Industry Board, plans for developing the export trade, and to make recommendations to the Cotton Industry Board for this purpose.COTTON INDUSTRY ADVISORY COMMITTEE11. The Board of Trade should appoint a Cotton Industry . Advisory Committee, consisting of three persons not engaged in, connected with, or financially interested in the cotton industry.12. The main function of the Advisory Committee would
be to examine schemes recommended by the Cotton Industry Board for the approval of the Board of Trade and to report to the Board of Trade whether any particular scheme is likely to involve undue hardship in any section or sections, and whether the Advisory Committee is satisfied that: (1) It is not contrary to the interests of those employed in the industry;(2)  It is not contrary to the public interest;(3) New firms can be admitted on terms which will be equitable both to them and to firms already in the industry;(4) Provision is made to allow for the expansion of the industry in response to increasing demand-or technical improvements; and(5) Adequate provision is made for the needs and development of the export trade.SCOPE OF BILL[NOTE.
