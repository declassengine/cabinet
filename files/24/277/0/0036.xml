3. E C , R, E T.CP. 155 (58). COPY NO.  _ - v?lCAB I N E T. REPLACEMENT OF H. M.   YACHT VICTORIA AND ALBERT.Memorandum by the First Lord of the Admiralty.The question has arisen of providing another ship to take the place of the Royal Yacht VICTORIA AND ALBERT.      This Yacht which was launched in 1899,  is now not only quite out of date but would also require extensive and costly repairs if she were to be retained in commission.      Amongst other defects is the accommodation for the men which, being old-fashioned,  is inferior to that which is provided in these days throughout the Navy.      It is obviously desirable that His Majesty should be provided with a suitable Yacht in which to go to sea and plans have already been drawn up for the construction of such a vessel.      I doubt whether the proposal is likely to incur serious criticism and it can always be pointed out that in war a ship of this kind can be transformed into a hospital ship, and plans for such transformation have already been worked out.      It would be necessary to include the ship in next year&apos;s Navy Estimates but in the meanwhile,  if the Cabinet approve of the proposal, steps could be taken between now and next spring in order that when Parliament has agreed,  there may be as little delay as possible in construction and delivery.I have thought however that it is a matter with regard to which I should be glad of the views of my colleagues as it is not really a question of naval policy.(Intld. )       D. C0Admiralty,30th June,  1938.
