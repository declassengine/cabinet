CP. 73 (29).CABINET.THE OIL POSITION IN IRAQ.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.I WILL not attempt to set out in detail the long and complicated history of this question. Stated quite briefly, the position is that the concession to exploit the oil resources of the northern provinces of Iraq is held by a Company known as the Turkish Petroleum Company. The Company is an international one and is composed of four groups (British, Anglo-Dutch, French and American) holding an equal proportion of shares. Under the terms of the concession the Company is required to select, within a stated period, the areas in which it proposes to operate, and after the expiration of that period the plots not selected by the Company are to be thrown open to public auction. Some time ago the concessionnaires struck oil in large quantities in a particular locality. As a result, they decided to con-concentrate upon the immediate development of this locality and on the construction of a pipe-line to convey the oil to the Mediterranean. &quot;In pursuance of this policy they applied to the Iraq Government for an extension of the period within which their other plots had to be selected. The Iraq Cabinet passed a Resolution agreeing to the extension, but the resolution could not become effective until it had been sub-mitted to the King and accepted by the Iraq Parliament. At this stage another (British) group intervened with an application to take part in the development of the Iraq oil-fields. A memorandum regarding the activities of this group, which is known as the British Oil Development, was circulated to the Cabinet in May last (CP. 164 (28)). The new Company held out various inducements to the Iraq Government and, in particular, gave some rather vague assurances as to their willingness to promote the construction of a trans-desert railway from Bagdad to the Mediterranean. The result was that the King postponed action on the resolution of his Cabinet, which has not yet been submitted to the Iraq Parliament. The Turkish Petroleum Company have been granted a brief extension of a few months (due to expire very shortly), but the general question of complying with their request remains unsettled.One effect of the intervention of the British Oil Development was to stimulate the Turkish Petroleum Company into making counter-offers on their own account, and to compel them to interest themselves in their turn in the question of the railway. It was while these discussions were in progress that a Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence was appointed, under the Chairmanship of Lord Stanhope, to investigate the whole question of the railway and pipe-line. The report of this Sub-Committee is now under circulation to the Cabinet. The whole position is one of great delicacy. From the point of view of His Majesty&apos;s Government, it is considered essential, on grounds of imperial defence, that the railway and pipe-line, if constructed, should find their Mediterranean terminal at Haifa, in Palestine, and not at one of the French-Syrian ports. The Turkish Petroleum Company, as a Company, cannot be expected to look at the matter merely from the point of view of the wishes of His Majesty&apos;s Government or of the Iraq Government (who are equally strong for Haifa as against a Syrian port). They naturally have first regard to their own interests, and will select the route and the terminal which can be shown to their satisfaction to offer the greatest commercial advantages. Sir John Cadman. the Chairman of the Turkish Petroleum Company, with whom I have been in con-fidential communication on the subject for some time past, is personally for the Haifa route, which he believes will prove in the long run the only practicable one. He is handicapped, however, by the international character of the Company and[This Document ia the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government, j SECRET. Copy No.      27
by the necessity of carrying his French colleagues with him. The Iraq Government in strongly favouring Haifa are probably actuated partly by dislike of the French and partly by the King&apos;s desire that the pipe-line, &amp;c, should pass through Trans-Jordan (which is under the rule of his brother) and thus remove the menace of a northward expansion by Ibn Saud, which would separate Iraq from Trans-Jordan. It is clearly open to the Iraq Government, of whom the Company are asking a favour, to make their own conditions as to its grant. At the same time, I have been anxious that these conditions should be of a nature which the Turkish Petroleum Company (given its internal difficulties, &amp;c.) should not find it too hard to accept, and, in so far as I have intervened in the matter at all, it has been with the object of securing this end. It was for this purpose that I wrote to Sir John Cadman in November last (after full discussion with all the interested Departments) the letter which forms Appendix I to this memorandum, suggesting a certain form of words for use by the Company in a letter to be addressed by them to the Iraq Government. My suggestion was accepted by Sir J. Cadman, and when put by him to his Board was duly adopted. It was, however, adopted by a majority only. The British, Dutch and American groups were in favour of it, the French group against it. The French Government have now formally protested and demanded that the letter shordd be withdrawn, and that His Majesty&apos;s Government should refrain from all further intervention and leave the matter to be settled on a com-mercial basis between the Compairy and the Iraq Government. The terms of the French note indicate that they intend to push their opposition to extremes. Sir W. Tyrrell has even hinted that &quot; difficulties must be anticipated on other Middle Eastern questions if the attitude of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the present dispute is to be maintained unchanged.&quot;Further correspondence (printed as Appendix II) has followed between the Foreign Office and Colonial Office consequent upon the receipt of the French note I will not attempt to analyse this correspondence in detail. Briefly stated, the view taken by the Foreign Office is that the advantages of maintaining the position taken up in my letter to Sir J. Cadman are insufficient to outweigh the disadvantages of a serious dispute with France. For these reasons the Foreign Office would prefer to authorise the British Ambassador at Paris to endeavour, by personal negotiation at the Quai d&apos;Orsay, to arrive at some formula satisfactory to the French Government. The Colonial Office have opposed this view and have held that, if the French persist in their present attitude, a dispute with them at some stage is inevitable; that the consequences, so far as the Middle East is concerned, can easily be overestimated: and that, all things considered, the balance of advantage lies in adhering to our position, seeing that, in view of circumstantial reports of American defection to the French point of view, it may not be possible to recover this position if we recede from it now. To this view the Foreign Office demur, and have pressed their suggestion for informal discussions at Paris with a view to arriving at a formula.I circulate for information a letter (Appendix III) recently received from Sir H. Dobbs, late High Commissioner for Iraq, recording a conversation last month with the French High Commissioner for Syria. It is of importance as illustrating the lengths to which the French are apparently prepared to go, in order to influence the Turkish Petroleum-Company in favour of an alignment through Syria.L. S. A.Colonial Office, March 11, 1929.APPENDIX I.Letter from Mr. Amery to Sir John Cadman. (Personal and Confidential.)Dear Sir John, November 7, 1928.I NOW write, after considering your letter of the 31st October, to say that, whilst I should, of course, as you know, have liked to have Haifa definitely mentioned in the Agreement, yet, if the French Group will not agree, and if its inclusion would be likely to lead them into difficulties with their Government. I should be prepared to meet their views to the extent of agreeing in principle to the mention of Haifa being relegated to a separate letter, which would not be published with the principal Agreement.
We should not, however, be prepared to recommend this course to the Iraq Government unless the letter were so framed as in effect to bind the Turkish Petroleum Company as completely in this matter of Haifa as would the express mention of that port in the text of the Agreement. I do not consider that the form of letter which you suggest would satisfy this requirement. I should be glad, therefore, if you would consider the adoption of the following alternative : &apos;&apos; In regard to the terms of Article 2 (c) of the Agreement dated , 1928, between the Government and this Company, we undertake further, and in particular, having regard to the omission from the Agreement of any specific Mediterranean terminal, that the survey shall be made in the first instance under the conditions of that Article from Bagdad to Haifa, and that a complete project for the construction of a railway on that route shall be submitted in accordance with Article 2 (e), unless, as a result of the survey, it is proved to the satisfaction of both parties that there are technical difficulties which render impracticable the adoption of that route. We further undertake that, in carrying out the aforesaid survey, all reasonable and possible steps will be taken to provide thereby sufficient detail for the preparation of a reliable estimate of the cost of construction of a railway.&quot;I gained the impression from our conversation on the 29th October that you were yourself satisfied that the French interests in the Company were in reality more or less reconciled to the fact that Haifa would ultimately be selected as the western terminal of the railway and pipe-line, and that their opposition arose from their objection to any public admission of this fact at the present stage, since this might cause an outcry in France which would force the French Government to intervene. If this is the case, the omission of all mention of Haifa from the published document (although the Iraq Government would, of course, reserve the right to publish the letter hereafter if they thought that the Company were not carrying out their undertakings) should dispose of the principal objection of your French colleagues, and enable them, and the Turkish Petroleum Company as a whole, to accent the revised wording which I have suggested and which we would do our best to induce the Iraq Government to accept.If, on the other hand, they maintain their opposition, we can only assume that their objection is more fundamental than we supposed, and that they are determined to resist the selection of a Palestine port as the terminal. In that case we should have to reconsider our whole position. I should be ready to consider any minor modifications of wording that you might wish to suggest, but I must make it plain that we could not urge the Iraq Government to accept any arrangement that did not commit the Company to Haifa at least as definitely as the formula which I have suggested. i(Signed) L. S. A.APPENDIX II.Ccorrespondence between Foreign Office and Colonial Office.[E 565/62/93] (1.)(Immediate and. Confidential.)Sir, . Foreign Office, February 6, 1929.WITH reference to Foreign Office letter No. E 6085/94/65 of the 14th January, relative to the objections made by the French Government to the proposed new arrangement between the Iraqi Government and the Turkish Petroleum Company,. I am directed by Secretary Sir Austen Chamberlain to request you to inform Mr. Secretary Amery that he has received from Elis Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Paris strong representations as to the effects on Anglo-French relations of the attitude adopted by His Majesty&apos;s Government in this matter.2. Sir W. Tyrrell has received from M. Berthelot, as a personal communication, a memorandum, a copy of which is enclosed, and the Secretary of State desires to draw the special attention of Mr. Amery to the following points in this communication.
3. In discussing the modification of the draft letter from the Turkish Petroleum Company to the Iraqi Government (dealt with in paragraph 4 of the note of the 12th January to the French Ambassador), M. Berthelot points out that Sir J. Cadman informed the French group on the 9th November last that he had modified the first draft &quot; in order to obtain the full support of the mandatory Power &quot; (see Sir J. Cadman&apos;s letter to M. Mercier of the 9th November last, a copy of which accompanied the Foreign Office letter No. E 5470/94/65 of the 20th November last). In paragraph 5 of his memorandum, M.&quot;Berthelot adds that the representative of the American group stated on the 20th December last that he knew from a sure source that the Iraqi Government had never asked that the terminus of the railway should be at Haifa, and that that Government never desired the Company to communicate the proposed letter. This information is said to be derived from certain statements made by the Iraqi Prime Minister to Mr. Stewart Morgan, director of the Near East Corporation.4. His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador expresses the opinion that, if His Majestvs Government persist in their present attitude, the French Government will officially request, while taking note of the fact that &quot; it is not for His Majesty&apos;s Government either to approve or disapprove the action of the Turkish Petroleum Company in the matter,&quot; that the Company should be clearly informed of the complete liberty left to it in this respect, particularly as regards the possible withdrawal of the draft letter, and that in future it should preserve full liberty to manage its own interests, acting-only upon purely economic considerations, within the framework of the international agreements in force.5. Further, in forwarding this memorandum to Sir W. Tyrrell, M. Berthelot referred to a conversation between himself and the Secretary of State on the 29th June last. He observed that on this occasion, when he proposed to deal comprehensively with the questions concerning both His Majesty&apos;s Government and the French Government in Iraq, Syria, the Turkish frontiers, &amp;c, the Secretary of State gave a favourable reception to the idea that the two Governments should not oppose each other, nor continue discussions which grew more acrimonious, but reach an understanding by reciprocal concessions. M. Berthelot added that, while he may have misunderstood the Secretary of State&apos;s views, Sir Austen Chamberlain had appeared to him to be convinced that no difficulties need be feared as regards the Bagdad-Haifa Railway, as this line presented more drawbacks than advantages. Finally, M. Berthelot referred to the possibility of seeking the support of the American group in this discussion.6. Sir W. Tyrrell states that M. Berthelot&apos;s reference to this conversation (with regard to which further observations are made in a succeeding paragraph) causes him particularly anxiety, the more so as in the Jebel-Sinjar section of the Syrian-Iraqi frontier His Majesty&apos;s Government are actually desirous of obtaining concessions from the French Government. He points out also that difficulties must be anticipated on other Middle Eastern questions if the attitude of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the present dispute is to be maintained unchanged. The Ambassador enquires, therefore, whether His Majesty&apos;s Government would consider it opportune to take up the suggestion made by M. Berthelot in June last for a general discussion of Franco-British difficulties in Iraq in particular and in the Middle East in general.7. As regards the conversation between the Secretary of State and M. Berthelot. I am to observe that a suggestion for en bloc treatment of Anglo-French difficulties was then made by M. Berthelot, who, however, certainly misunderstood anything Sir Austen Chamberlain may have said about the Haifa Railway. The record of the conversation made at the time (a copy of the relevant passage is enclosed) does not indicate that this question was discussed, though Sir Austen Chamberlain considers it possible that he may have spoken of the difficulty of raising the large capital required without a guarantee and the unlikelihood of His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment giving that guarantee. He was, however, as the enclosed note of the conversation shows, not carrying on negotiations with M. Berthelot, and did not enter into any commitment.8. Sir Austen Chamberlain recognises that several of the statements made by M. Berthelot are open to serious question. He is, however, of opinion that no progress can be made towards a satisfactory solution by continued argument on the present lines: and he does not therefore desire for the moment to examine these statements in detail. It will, however, be realised that, if M. Berthelofs account of the present attitude of the Iraqi Government can be substantiated, the ground on which the action of His Majesty&apos;s Government has been defended, i.e., that they were acting m
Aide-memoire.1. LE projet adopte le 30 octobre par le conseil d&apos;administration de la Turkish Petroleum Company portait que cette compagnie etudierait le trace d&apos;un chemin de fer allant de Bagdad a la Mediterranee. Une lettre annexe destinee au Gouverne-ment de lTrak devait indiquer que, parmi les traces qui seraient etudies, figurerait eelui sur Haiffa.2. En 1&apos;absence des representants des groupes de la compagnie et sans leur assentiment prealable, le president de la Turkish Petroleum Company a modifie lepursuance of the wishes of that Government, can no longer be maintained. I am accordingly to express the hope that, unless Mr. Amery sees strong objection, the Acting High Commissioner at Bagdad may be instructed by telegram to report whether, in his opinion, the Iraqi Government do or do not now desire to secure the Haifa alignment for the proposed Bagdad-Mediterranean Railway.9. Apart from this point, however, the renewed representations of the French Government render it essential to consider what course of action will best promote the objects which His Majesty&apos;s Government have had in view throughout these negotiations. If the attitude hitherto adopted is to be maintained, and an attempt is to be made to secure the conclusion of the new agreement between the Turkish Petroleum Company and the Iraqi Government in the form proposed, it has now become certain that this can only be done in the face of the strongest possible French opposition, which will be carried into other fields. The question arises then whether the position of His Majesty&apos;s Government in this issue, and the advantages to be gained by an insistence on their present attitude, would justify such a course.10. While the representations made by the French Government have raised various points, the whole question in fact turns upon the circumstances in which the revised draft letter from the Company to the Iraqi Government was produced. When this letter was drafted, it was hoped (see Mr. Amery&apos;s letter of the 7th November last to Sir J. Cadman) that it would be accepted by the Board of the Company as a substitute for their original draft. It was, however, not voluntarilv accepted by the representatives of the French group on the Board, nor can it be maintained that the actual terms of the revised draft were desired by the Iraqi Government. These facts seriously weaken the position of His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment; and it also appears necessary to bear in mind the possibility that the American group will, in view of the advice which they are no doubt receiving from their agent in Iraq, take the French side in this question. On the other hand, the revised draft, though more advantageous to the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government than the Turkish Petroleum Company draft, does not in itself ensure the selection of the Haifa route for the railway.11. In these circumstances the Secretary of State is strongly of opinion that an endeavour should be made to find some solution of the difference which has arisen with the French Government. He does not recommend that this question should be included in an attempt to secure a general settlement of Anglo-French problems in the Middle East, as any such negotiations would necessarily be prolonged. He would prefer to authorise His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Paris to endeavour, by personal negotiation with M. Berthelot, to arrive at some formula satisfactory to the &quot;French Government, on the basis of the last paragraph of the enclosed memorandum. For the reasons already stated, Sir Austen Chamberlain does not consider that the advantages of maintaining the revised draft are sufficient to outweigh the dangers to the prospects of the Bagdad-Haifa Railway which are inevitable if a serious dispute with the French Government is allowed to develop. Sir Austen Chamberlain is in fact most reluctant to enter into such a dispute on the present issue, and earnestly hopes that Mr. Amery will concur in his proposal to send instructions to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Paris on the lines suggested above.12. The Secretary of State assumes that, in view of the present situation of the Iraqi Government, there is no immediate prospect of their approving the agreement with the Turkish Petroleum Company. In view, however, of the short time still available before the expiry of the period of the Company&apos;s exclusive rights, I am to express the hope that a reply may be returned to this letter at the earliest possible-date.I am, &amp;c.

projet du 30 octobre en y ajoutant que le trace&quot; sur Bagdad-Haiffa serait etudie par priorite. II a indique au groupe francais, le 9 novembre, qu&apos;il avait du apporter cette modification, afin d&apos;obtenir le plein appui de la Puissance mandataire.3. La question du chemin de fer Irak-Mediterranee et par voie de consequence, celle du pipe-line, paraissant ainsi deplacee du terrain economique pour etre portee sur le terrain politique, 1&apos;Ambassadeur de France a Londres a demande s&apos;il etait exact que la Puissance mandataire frit intervenue dans ce sens. Une note du Foreign Office, du 28 novembre, sans donner de precisions a ce sujet, a indique que le Gouvernement britannique considerait 1&apos;Irak comme pleinement justifie a obtenir les compensations inscrites dans 1&apos;accord, tel qu&apos;il avait ete modifie. et qu&apos;il ne voyait pas d&apos;objection a cet arrangement.4. Le Gouvernement francais a done pu conclure que c&apos;est sur 1&apos;avis du Gouvernement britannique que le president de la Turkish Petroleum Company a modifie le projet primitif. Aussi, a-t-il fait remettre, le 10 decembre, au Foreign Office, une note protestant contre &quot; la prevention de 1&apos;Irak d&apos;exiger qu&apos;une preference soit donnee a 1&apos;etude d&apos;une voie aboutissant a un point dont la designation n&apos;offre pas d&apos;interet direct pour cet Etat, puisqu&apos;il est exterieur a son territoire,&quot; et contre &quot; 1&apos;intervention dans le meme sens du Gouvernement britannique aupres du president de la Turkish Petroleum Company, alors que cette compagnie s&apos;est prononcee dans un sens contraire.&quot; Le Gouvernement francais demandait en conclusion que la compagnie fut dispensee de donner la priorite a 1&apos;etude d&apos;un trace de Bagdad a Haiffa.5. Par la suite, le representant du groupe americain faisait, a la reunion de la Turkish Petroleum Company du 20 decembre, une communication qui se trouvait preciser le sens et la portee de F intervention du Gouvernement francais. M. Piesse declarait savoir, de source absolument sure, que le Gouvernement irakien n&apos;avait jamais demande que le terminus du chemin de fer de 1&apos;Irak a la Mediterranee, dont il prevoyait 1&apos;etude, frit specialement Haiffa. La meme personnalite- pouvait ajouter que 1&apos;Irak ne desirait pas que la Turkish Petroleum Company lui remit la lettre annexee au contrat a intervenir. et elle donnait comme source de ces renseignements les declarations faites par le Premier Ministre de 1&apos;Irak a Mr. Stuart Morgan, directeur de la Near East Corporation.6. Ces indications n&apos;ont ete dementies ou infirmees, ni par le president de la reunion, ni par le directeur general de la compagnie, a qui les representants de plusieurs groupes ont demande a plusieurs reprises, et sans obtenir de reponse, qui avait impose la priorite en faveur d&apos;Haiffa. du moment oil 1&apos;Irak n&apos;etait pas intervenu.7. La reponse a cette question semblait d&apos;ailleurs donnee par l5argument invoque par Sir John Cadman aupres des membres de la compagnie pour justifier son attitude, a savoir que la modification apportee a la lettre etait necessaire pour obtenir le plein appui de la Puissance mandataire; c&apos;est pour obtenir cet appui que la compagnie a accepte la nouvelle redaction.8. Dans ces conditions, le Gouvernement francais se considerait comme particulierement fonde a obtenir du Gouvernement britannique qu&apos;il revint sur une intervention de nature a restreindre gravement la liberte d&apos;action de la Turkish Petroleum Company et a en compromettre les interets.9. Aussi, est-ce avec une penible surprise que le Gouvernement francais a pris connaissance de la reponse adressee le 12 Janvier par le Foreign Office a la note de TAmbassadeur de France a Londres.10. Le Gouvernement britannique declare qu3il ne lui est pas possible d&apos;inter-venir aupres du Gouvernement irakien et de la Turkish Petroleum Company porir Tannulation de la lettre annexe. II observe que les termes de cette lettre sont des maintenant acceptes par les repr^sentants de la compagnie, et il estime, d&apos;autre part, que le Gouvernement irakien avait le droit, s&apos;il le desirait, d&apos;obtenir cette etude particuliere de trace sur Haiffa, etude qui, en aout dernier, avait fait 1&apos;objet d&apos;une resolution du Conseil des Ministres irakien. Enfin, pas plus que dans sa precedente note, il n&apos;indique s&apos;il est intervenu aupres de la compagnie.11. D&apos;un point de vue general, qu&apos;il s&apos;agisse de 1&apos;action du Gouvernement britannique ou de celle du Gouvernement irakien, le Gouvernement francais ne pent que maintenir, de ia facon la plus formelle, la protestation qu&apos;il a elevee contre une action qui a pour effet, contrairement aux Accords de San-Remo, de grever d&apos;une charge. politique 1&apos;exploitation de la Turkish Petroleum Company. Quant a la nature meme de cette action, il ne peut que s&apos;en remettre a la loyaute du Gouverne-ment britannique.
12. Tout en prenant acte de la declaration faite par le Gouvernement de Sa Majeste, dans sa note du 12 Janvier, qu&apos;il n&apos;a ni a approuver, ni a desapprouver l&apos;action de la lurkish Petroleum Company touchant cette affaire, le Gouvernement francais se trouve dans 1&apos;obligation dTnsister pour que la compagnie soit clairement informee de 1 entiere latitude qui lui est laissee a cet egard, notamment en ce qui concerne le retrait eventuel de la lettre annexe, et pour qu&apos;a 1&apos;avenir elle conserve la complete liberte de gerer ses interets, en ne s&apos;inspirant que de considerations purement economiques dans le cadre des accords internationaux en vigueur.Le 23 Janvier 1929.Extract.[E 3364/56/44]M. Berthelot called upon me at the Foreign Office this afternoon and we had a long conversation.4fe ^fe ^ ^ $fe zfe3. M. Berthelot then turned to the Middle East. He spoke of the Bagdad Railway and the desire of the Wagons Lits Company to acquire the shares now in possession of the Reparations Commission and to extend the line to Bagdad, and in this connexion of the various possibilities for pipe-lines and railways. He spoke also of the unsettled frpntier between Iraq and Syria, and again between Syria and Turkey. Of the Turkish attitude he spoke with vehemence, and even bitterness. As regards the questions which interested Iraq and ourselves, he suggested that we should try to settle them as a whole by mutual concession rather than attempt to treat them piecemeal, when agreement might be much more difficult. I was not prepared to discuss these questions in detail. I confined myself to saying that I thought his suggestion for a general settlement was a wise one, and that I desired a friendly arrangement as much as he did. At the moment, however, we were con-suiting the Government of Iraq, and we could make no progress till we had their reply. M. Berthelot remarked that the decision of the Government of Iraq would certainly follow our advice, to which I replied that matters were not quite as simple as that and we also had our local difficulties.(Initialled) A. C.June 29, 1928.(2.)(Immediate and Confidential.) 68354/29.Sir, Colonial Office, February 18, 1929.I AM directed by Mr. Secretary Amery to acknowledge the receipt of Foreign Office letter No. E 565/62/93 of the 6th February, enclosing a copy of an aide-memoire forwarded to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Paris by M. Berthelot relative to the objections felt by the French Government towards the proposed new agreement between the Iraq Government and the Turkish Petroleum Company. I am to transmit herewith, for the information of Secretary Sir Austen Chamberlain, a memorandum prepared in the Colonial Office containing extracts from recent correspondence demonstrating the Iraq GovernmemVs desire that the proposed railway to the Mediterranean should follow the Haifa alignment and should not debouch at a port on the coast of Syria. As there is already in the possession of His Majesty&apos;s Government ample evidence of the wishes of the Iraq Government in this matter, Mr. Amery is inclined to doubt whether any useful purpose would be served by addressing the Acting High Commissioner for Iraq in the manner suggested in the eighth paragraph of the letter under reply. It appears to Mr. Amery, however, that it might be Avell to endeavour to obtain from the Iraq Government a rather more formal pronouncement on the subject than those obtained hitherto, and one the authority of which Would not easily be questioned. This could scarcely be done without informing the Iraq Government of the substance of the French Governments present demarche, and I am, therefore, to enquire whether, in all the circumstances, Sir Austen Chamberlain desires that Mr. Bourdillon should be instructed to approach the Iraq Government to that end:2. The statement in the tenth paragraph of the letter under reply that it cannot be maintained that the actual terms of the revised draft of the proposed letter
from the Turkish Petroleum Company to the Iraq Government were desired by that Government although strictly accurate, scarcely gives full justice to all the relevant facts. It ignores, for example, the important fact that the revised formula regarding; the survey of the route for a railway to Haifa, which was suggested to Sir John Cadman in Mr. Amery&apos;s letter of the 7th November last and finally adopted by the Turkish Petroleum Company, was, if perhaps no less binding in effect, undoubtedly less definite in form (as being excluded from the formal agreement) and thus more favourable to the standpoint of the French Government than the wording originally suggested by the Iraq Government and accepted in the first instance by the Turkish Petroleum Company&apos;s representative In Iraq. It appeared to Mr. Amery at the time, and he is unaware of any subsequent development which would tend to invalidate the conclusion then reached, that any formula less definite than that finally adopted would have failed to satisfy the Iraq Government.3. The general question of policy discussed in your letter raises issues of the highest importance, a decision in regard to which, Mr. Amery suggests, will involve considerations outside the respective spheres of the Foreign Office and Colonial Office. Important Imperial interests are concerned, affecting questions of Imperial defence, which would seem to call for a further submission to the Cabinet.4. If Mr. Amery rightly appreciates the course of action advocated in your letter, it would seem that a definite surrender to the French Governments views is contemplated, possibly involving political action vis-a-vis the Iraq Government to induce them to abandon their demand for a survey of the Bagdad-Haifa route in return for the extension of time desired by the Turkish Petroleum Company. If such action were taken and were effective, the result would be that the Turkish Petroleum Company would have obtained their extension without the project for a railway to Haifa being brought any nearer to realisation and without the prospect of the selection of that port as the western terminal of the pipe-line being in any way enhanced. Thus, without securing any commensurate advantage, an important bargaining counter would have been voluntarily relinquished to the seeming-detriment of both Iraqi and Imperial interests.5. Mr. Amery fully appreciates Sir Austen Chamberlain&apos;s reluctance to enter upon a serious dispute with the French Government on this or any other issue, and he would naturally be averse from advocating a course of action which would bring the interests of the two Governments into conflict, unless the end in view was of vital importance and a conflict of interests was in any case unavoidable. In this matter of the pipe-line and the Trans-Desert railway, British and French interests are diametrically opposed. The difference is a fundamental one, and one which, in Mr. Amery&apos;s opinion, must at some stage lead to a dispute with the French Government. If His Majesty&apos;s Government were now to defer to the French repre-sentations, it would merely be postponing the difficulty, since it would in any case be necessary, if the end in view is to be secured, to make a stand at some later stage, and then possibly under conditions less favourable to His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Iraq Government.6. As Sir Austen Chamberlain is aware, the French Government have for some time been directing their energies to detaching the American Group from the British and Anglo-Dutch bloc in the Turkish Petroleum Company. It was only with the help of the American Vote that Sir J. Cadman was successful in obtaining the&apos; approval of his Board to the revised offer recently made to the Iraq Government regarding the survey of the Bagdad-Haifa Railway route. The French Govern-ment may be expected to resent the fact that this decision was taken before their &apos; influence Over the American Group had been effectively established; and their present demarche seems likely to be aimed at nullifying the initial advantage thus gained by His Majesty&quot;s Government and the Iraq Government. There is every reason to believe thatthe&apos; French Government have now definitely won Mr. Stewart Morgan (the American Group&apos;s representative) over to their side, and that through him they will be able :to influence the voting of the American Group. If, therefore, in the face of French pressure, His Majesty:s Government were to forgo their present &apos; advantage, it is probable that when the issue is raised again the French would be able to count upon the support of the American group and thus to block any proposal &apos; for a railway or a pipe-line to Haifa, since, under the Constitution of the Turkish Petroleum Company, no important measure can be decided upon unless supported by three of the major groups. .&apos;&apos; 1r The alternatives before His Majesty&apos;s Government thus seem to be either to abandon the idea cf securing the adoption of Haifa as the Mediterranean terminal
of the pipe-line, or to face, now and overcome strong opposition on the part of the French Government. The choice between these alternatives is one which, in Mr. Amery&apos;s opinion, must be left to the decision of the Cabinet, and he would suggest, therefore, that, in the first instance, the present correspondence should be referred for the consideration of the Committee of Imperial Defence.8. In making this suggestion, however, Mr. Amery thinks it only right to point out that a course of action which might commend itself to His Majesty&apos;s Government on grounds of international policy might well prove unwelcome to the Iraq Government, who, he believes, are determined by some means or oth.er.to obtain the construction of a railway from Bagdad to Haifa and to avoid the adoption of a Syrian alignment for the pipe-line to the Mediterranean. The attitude of that Government must therefore remain an important, if not a decisive, factor, and one which must in some measure influence the ultimate decision of His Majesty&apos;s Government.9. Mr. Amery has no wish to minimise the serious consequences of a dispute with the French Government on this issue, but he suggests that in the 6th paragraph of your letter there is possibly a tendency to overestimate the probable effects in so far as Middle Eastern territories are concerned. He notes that His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Paris is. apprehensive of the influence which such a dispute might have upon the question of the Syro-Iraq frontier. Mr. Amery would, however, point out that, in the absence of any actual dispute, the French Government have shown little disposition towards a reasonable settlement of this question, and, indeed, have consistently declined even to discuss the possibility of a rectification of the Anglo-French Convention line. If the French Government were now, as a result of the present disagreement, to persist in this attitude, the existing position would not be materially impaired, and it would always be open to His Majesty&apos;s Government in the last resort to invite the assistance of the League of Nations in the settlement of the frontier dispute, and to do so with good prospect of success, since it would be possible to submit a very strong case in favour of a modification of the Convention line in the region of the Jebel Sinjar. Consistent and deliberate opposition on the part of the French Government to British policy in the Middle Eastern Territories, which Sir W. Tyrrell also apparently apprehends, would, of course, be embarrassing and unfortunate, but the political situation&apos;in Iraq, Palestine and Trans-Jordan is so much more stable than that in Syria, and the relations between Iraq and Turkey are at present established on so firm a basis, that Mr. Amery finds it difficult to believe that, looking only to that part of the world, French opposition could, in fact, cause His Majesty&apos;s Government really serious injury.10. Copies of this letter are being forwarded to the Admiralty, Air Ministry, Treasury and to the Petroleum Department of the Mines Department.I am, &amp;c.  . (Signed)      O. G. R. WILLIAMS.The Under-Seoretary of State, Foreign Office.[E 865/62/93] (3.)(Immediate and Confidential.)Sir, Foreign Office, February 25, 1929.I AM directed by Secretary Sir Austen Chamberlain to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. 68354/29 of the 18th February regarding the attitude of the French Government in connexion with the negotiations between the Turkish Petroleum Company and the Iraqi Government.2. The Secretary of State desires, in the first place, to make it clear that it was in no way the intention of the Foreign Office letter of the 6th February to suggest that His Majesty&apos;s Government should abandon their policy of endeavouring to secure that the proposed railway from Bagdad to the Mediterranean should follow the Haifa1, alignment, as appears to be assumed in paragraph 3 of your letter under reply.. Nor has he contemplated, as suggested in paragraph 4 of your letter, any complete surrender to the French Governments views, involving political action vis-a-vis the Iraqi Government. Indeed, Sir Austen Chamberlain fully shares Mr. Secretary Amery&apos;s views as to the importance, both from the Iraqi and from the imperial point of view, of making every effort to secure the ultimate adoption of the Haifa align-ment; and the only question at present at issue is that of the tactics which should now be pursued, in order most effectively to secure the fulfilment of the object in view.
In these circumstances, it appears to Sir Austen Chamberlain unnecessary, at this stage, to refer the matter to the Cabinet, or to the Committee of Imperial Defence, as suggested in paragraph 7 of your letter under reply.3. As between His Majesty&apos;s Government and the French Government, though various points have been raised in the correspondence, the question in dispute is, in fact, whether the revised draft letter from the Turkish Petroleum Company to tbe Iraqi Government is to be retained or not. This letter, whatever its advantages, does not of itself secure the construction of the proposed railway on that route. It is clear that a long and unpleasant controversy between the two Governments will be unavoidable if the requirement for the preferential survey of the Haifa route is to be maintained as part of the agreement, while, if it is so retained, the Company is still at liberty either to adopt some other route or to refrain from undertaking the construction of the railway at all.4. In the last resort, the question of the alignment, and, indeed, of the con-struction by the Company of the railway, must be decided by the Company itself and, as indicated in paragraph 6 of your letter, the attitude of the American group will be of great importance. But that group, even though its vote was instrumental in securing approval for the revised draft letter, is not thereby committed to approving the construction of a railway to Haifa, and in Sir Austen Chamberlain&apos;s opinion there is grave reason to apprehend that if it can be represented that the hands of the Turkish Petroleum Company have been forced in this matter by direct pressure from His Majesty&apos;s Government, and if a serious conflict is now allowed to develop between His Majesty&apos;s Government and the French Government on the sole question of the retention of the revised draft letter, the American group will in all probability be committed to the adoption of the French thesis, and, consequently, to an attitude of determined opposition to the Anglo-Iraqi point of view. He feels, in fact, that if no attempt is made to come to some compromise with the French Government, the result may well be that, in order to retain a document which does not guarantee the Haifa alignment, the prospects of the Company ever agreeing to that alignment will have been seriously jeopardised.5. The Secretary of State does not share Mr. Amery&apos;s view, as expressed in paragraph 5 of your letter, that a serious dispute with the French Government over this question is sooner or later inevitable. In any event, he finds it difficult to suggest any satisfactory grounds for rebutting the argument advanced in the penultimate paragraph of the French Ambassadors note of the 13th December, and repeated in the last paragraph of the memorandum from M. Berthelot enclosed in Foreign Office letter No. E 565/62/93 of the 6th February, to the effect that the Company and the Iraqi Government should be left free to come to a settlement on an economic basis. This contention cannot be effectively denied and, rather than engage in a dispute the result of which cannot, in Sir Austen Chamberlain&apos;s opinion, be conclusive, it appears to him to be only reasonable to ascertain whether it is not possible to come to some compromise. It was with this object that he desired to instruct His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Paris to ascertain whether a formula could be found, as suggested in paragraph 11 of Foreign Office letter of the 6th February, which would meet the general desiderata expressed in the last paragraph of M. Berthelots memorandum of the 23rd January, and indicate that His Majesty&apos;s Government were prepared to allows the Turkish Petroleum Company complete freedom to negotiate with the Iraqi Government on a purely economic basis.6. In these circumstances, Sir Austen ,Chamberlain&apos;s considered opinion is that the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government and the desiderata of the Iraqi Govern-ment are more likely to be furthered by methods of conciliation than by rigid Insistence on a line of action which has no guarantee of success, and he earnestly Iiopes that Mr. Amery will now agree to Sir W. Tyrrell being instructed to open informal conversations with M. Berthelot with a view to arriving at a formula, satis-factory to the French Government and to His Majesty&apos;s Government, on the lines suggested above.&apos; 7. Sir. Austen Chamberlain shares the views expressed in your letter under reply as to the importance of the attitude of the Iraqi Government towards this question. If, indeed, that Government are as determined as is suggested in paragraph 8 of your letter to secure the construction of the proposed railway on the Haifa alignment and to prevent the adoption of an alignment through Syria, there is no reason why they should not insist upon this condition as a sine qua non in their negotiations with the Turkish Petroleum Company for an extension of the Company^ time limit for the selection of plots, without its being necessary for His
ajesty&apos;s Government to intervene. In any case,.there can be no question, as w-ggested in paragraph 4 of your letter, of His Majesty&apos;s Government taking any action with the Iraqi Government to induce them to abandon any demand which they may put forward for a survey of the Bagdad-Haifa route. But, in view of the present uncertain position of the Iraqi Government, and of their refusal to take any important decisions pending the re-establishment of a more normal political situation in Iraq, it seems improbable that they will be willing to commit themselves on the subject of the proposed new agreement with the Company before the expira-tion next month of the Company&apos;s provisional four months&apos; extension;. so that their only alternative is likely to be to grant a short further extension to enable negotia-tions to be pursued with any new Iraqi Government which may be constituted. In these circumstances, the Secretary of State considers that no useful purpose would be served by approaching the Iraqi Government in the sense suggested in the later part of paragraph 1 of your letter. In fact, the only method of dealing with the question now appears to him to be to negotiate with the French Government direct, as suggested in paragraph 6 above.8. Copies of this letter are being sent to the Admiralty, Air Ministry, Treasury, Petroleum Department (Mines Department) and the War Office.I am, &amp;c. (Signed) MONTEAGLE.APPENDIX III.Letter from Sir Henry Dobbs.East India United Service Club, (Confidential.) St. James&apos;s Square, S.W. 1,My dear Shuckburgh, February 19, 1929.ON the 8th February at Beyreuth, M. Ponsot, whose guest I was, spoke to me about the pipe-line and railway from Bagdad to the Mediterranean. The points he made were (1.) That Stuart Morgan, the representative of the American group in the T.P.C., about whom I wrote to you from Bagdad, had informed the French group that it was untrue that the Iraq Government or the Iraqis wanted the Haifa- route. It was purely British Government pressure which had induced them to ask for it.(2.) That the French Government had decided to build at an early date a railway from Horns to the Euphrates, via Palmyra. Its terminus would be either at Abu Kemal or Deir-ez-Zor. When that was done, no one but a madman could contemplate the railway or pipe-line terminating at any other place than Tripoli. He showed me volumes of &quot; etudes &quot; on this projected railway.(3.) That expert French engineers had shown that an excellent port for oil-tankers could be constructed for 100 million francs at Tripoli. The British arguments that the winds at Tripoli-were too bad was therefore baseless.As to (1), I can only say that Stuart Morgan&apos;s statement is untrue. All Iraqis who know anything about it are rabidly in favour of Haifa, partly because they dislike the French and the prospect of French control of the terminus; partly because they want direct connexion with Trans-Jordania and Palestine; largely because they think the pipe-line and railway, if brought south, will prevent Ibn Saud from pursuing his plans for extending north and cutting off Iraq from Palestine.As to (2), if the French really build a railway to Abu Kemal, they will certainly have greatly strengthened their case.As to (3), I made enquiries from Mr. Catoni, His Britannic Majesty&apos;s consul at Alexandretta. He says emphatically that Tripoli could not be made into a decent harbour for 100 million pounds. The bottom is very rocky, which causes anchors to drag in a storm. A howling wind from the land side constantly blows down the long trough of land leading down from Horns to Tripoli, and no harbour works could protect against this.   When this bad land wind does not blow, a very trouble-lb
some wind blows from the North-West. Lastly, there is no land round Tripoli available for building tanks and the other buildings which would be necessary for a big pipe-line terminus.It seems to me that the question of TMpoli harbour is the crux of the whole matter, and should be investigated by an impartial and authoritative commission.I regret, extremely, that the crisis at Bagdad over the Military and Financial Agreements prevented the signing of the convention for extending the T.P.C. period. That would have enabled us to present the French with a fait accompli to some extent.Yours ever, (Signed) H. DOBBS.Sir J. E. Shuckburgh, K.C.M.G., C.B.
