[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government, j SECRET. Copy No.    2 8CP. 75 (29).CABINET.form OF THE INSTRUMENT OF RATIFICATION, IN RESPECT OF THE IRISH FREE STATE, OF THE TREATY FOR THE renunciation-TION OF WAR.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.I CIRCULATE herewith, for the information of my colleagues, copies of despatches from and to the Irish Free State on the subject of the ratification, in respect of the Irish Free State, of the Treaty for the Renunciation of War (copies of the first two of these despatches were circulated with the Dominions Office print of telegrams and despatches issued on the 18th February). It will be recalled that this matter has been &quot;a source of considerable difficulty, and that it has already given rise to discussion of two important questions of principle, viz., the use of the Great Seal and the position of the Counsellors of State in relation to Dominion matters, with regard to which I have recently circulated two memoranda to the Cabinet, viz., CP. 24 (29) and CP. 30 (29) respectively.It will be seen from the Free State despatch of the 18th February that His Majesty&apos;s Government in the Irish Free State, while acquiescing in the views of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom with regard to the position of the Counsellors of State, and being ready to correct the instrument of ratification! in respect of the Irish Free State in certain minor particulars, maintained their desire to include in the preamble two recitals relating to the approval of the Dail and Senate and the advice of the Executive Council. As was pointed out to the Free State Government in my despatch of the 16th February, it is contrary to practice to make any reference in instruments of ratification to the approval of Parliament or to the advice upon which the King acts.After the fullest possible consideration, in the short time available for the purpose, of the questions involved by the form of the Irish Free State instrument, the Lord Chancellor, the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and I agreed that it was preferable in the circumstances not to raise any further difficulty with regard to the immediate signature of the instrument prepared by the Irish Free State Govern-ment. The document was accordingly submitted to the Royal Counsellors of State for signature oh behalf of His Majesty and, after being duly signed and sealed with the Great Seal, was despatched with the other British instruments of ratification to Washington on the 20th February.Any other alternative would have involved delay which would have rendered it impossible for the instruments of ratification in respect of all parts of the Empire to be simultaneously deposited during the lifetime of the Coolidge Administration.At the same time it appeared proper that His Majesty&apos;s Government in the Irish Free State should be fully informed of the views of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom. I append to this paper a copy of the despatch addressed to the Free State Government on the&apos;26th February, the terms of which were prepared in consultation with the Lord Chancellor and the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.L. S. A.Dominions Office, March 11, 1929.[18983]B
No. 42, Confidential. Department of External Affairs,Sir, Irish Free State, February 14, 1929.I HAVE the honour to acknowledge receipt of your Confidential despatch No. 63 of the 6th February,* enclosing a memorandum dealing with the position of the Counsellors of State.2. His Majesty&apos;s Government in the Irish Free State are glad to learn that, notwithstanding the manner of their appointment, the Counsellors of State in matters concerning certain of His Majesty&apos;s constitutional functions are considered to stand in the same relation to all the Governments of His Majesty as His Majesty himself. They also note with satisfaction that, in order to avoid even the suggestion that officers of State in Great Britain were acting in an executive capacity in the affairs of other States Members of the Commonwealth, it has been arranged that documents relating to these latter shall be signed exclusively by Her Majesty the Queen, the Prince of Wales and the Duke of York. It is nevertheless felt by His Majesty&apos;s Government in the Irish Free State that, in a matter of such grave import as the supreme affirmation of the people&apos;s will by the Sovereign, no doubts whatever should be allowed to persist as to the ultimate source of his authority or as to the strict constitutional sequence of the powers through which his authority is derived. The mere appearance of intervention, or shadow of intervention, by one of His Majesty&apos;s Governments between the Sovereign and his other Governments would destroy the very basis of the democratic institutions upon which the British Commonwealth of Nations is founded. It would, at least, strengthen the impression existing in certain spheres of Commonwealth thought that Great Britain acts as a sort of sieve between His Majesty and the other Nations of the Commonwealth to prevent the electors of these latter from enjoying constitutional privileges which the electors of Great Britain have enjoyed since the time when the Monarchy assumed its present constitutional character. His Majesty&apos;s Government in the Irish Free State fear that the method employed in the appointment of the Counsellors has in it some of the elements which encourage impressions of this nature, and, as they feel sure that His Majesty&apos;s Government in Great Britain are no less anxious than they are to make perfectly clear the relations existing between His Majesty and his several Governments, they hope that His Majesty&apos;s Government in Great Britain, of their own volition, will take the necessary steps to have the question placed on the Agenda of the next Imperial Conference.3. His Majesty&apos;s Government in the Irish Free State regret very much to learn that His Majesty&apos;s state of health is still very weak, and they do not wish, at this moment, to advise His Majesty to do anything which might require long and difficult explanations, and which might accordingly disturb the rest which is so necessary for his recovery. They have therefore decided to accept the signatures to the Kellogg Pact and other documents usually signed by His Majesty, of Her Majesty the Queen, the Prince of Wales and the Duke of York, as Counsellors of State, without a special ad hoc appointment by His Majesty, but they cannot agree to the citation of the Commission of Appointment in any document appertaining to the Irish Free State. The citation of the Commission would completely annul the constitutional advantages obtained by the arrangement for signature by members of. the Royal Family exclusively in matters concerning His Majesty&apos;s Governments other than that of Great Britain, and only the very gravest reasons of State would impel His Majesty&apos;s Government in the Irish Free State to give their consent, however qualified, to the citation ., ; :..4. I enclose the instrument of ratification! in the form desired by His Majesty&apos;s Government in the Irish Free State, who hereby advise Her Majesty the Queen, His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales and His Royal. Highness the Duke of York to sign the instrument.5. I shall feel very much obliged if you will have the signed instrument forwarded to our Charge d&apos;Affaires at Washington. He will be instructed to present the ratification simultaneously with His Majesty&apos;s other representatives wdren he has been advised by cable that the ratification has received the approval of the Oireachtas.I have, &amp;.c. (Signed) P. McGILLIGAN,Minister for External A ffairs.The Right Honourable the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, Downing Street, London, S.W. 1.* See CP. 30 (29).t Not printed.
No. 76.   Confidential.Sir, Downing Street, February 16, 1929.I HAVE the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your confidential despatch No. 42 of 14th February.2. His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland note with satisfaction that His Majesty&apos;s Government in the Irish Free State agree that documents usually signed by His Majesty in respect of the Irish Free State may, in present circumstances, properly be signed on behalf of His Majesty by Her Majesty the Queen, His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales and His Royal Highness the Duke of York.3. With regard to the observations contained in paragraph 2 of your despatch, His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom would point out that the position regarding advice to His Majesty in respect of Dominion affairs (both generally and in relation to certain statutory provisions) is set out in the Report of the Inter-Imperial Relations Committee of the Imperial Conference of 1926 (page 17 of Cmd. 2768, last paragraph but one). They agree that the question of the constitu-tional position in relation to the appointment of Counsellors of State might well be placed on the Agenda of the next Imperial Conference.4. As regards the form of signature by the Counsellors of State, it has not been the practice to include in any document (other than Orders in Council) usually signed by His Majesty any citation of the Order in Council authorising the Counsellors of State to sign on behalf of His Majesty. There is no question, there-fore, of any such citation in connexion with any instrument of ratification.5. His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom desire to bring to the attention of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the Irish Free State the following points arising from the form of the instrument of ratification of the Treaty for the Renunciation of War enclosed in your despatch : (a.) His Majesty&apos;s title is set out as &quot; George, by the Grace of God, of Great Britain, Ireland and of the British Dominions . . . .,&quot; &amp;e, whereas the correct title, as proclaimed by His Majesty in accordance with the conclusions of the Imperial Conference in 1926, is &quot; George, by the Grace of God, of Great Britain, Ireland and the British Dominions . . . .,&quot; &amp;c.(b.) In the instruments of ratification already prepared in respect of the United Kingdom and of other Dominions, the Treaty to be ratified is described as &quot; a Treaty between Us, and other Powers and States, providing for the renunciation of war as an instrument of national policy.&apos;&apos; This would appear to be a more accurate description of the Treaty in question, and it would, moreover, seem desirable that the Treaty should be described in identical terms in all the instruments of ratification deposited on behalf of His Majesty.(c.) Although it is customary in the Irish Free State, and to a greater or less extent the practice both in this country and in other Dominions, to submit treaties to Parliament prior to ratification, it is not in accordance with constitutional practice to make any reference in the instrument of ratification to the approval of any of the Parliaments to any Treaty so ratified, e.g., no such reference was made in the instrument of ratification of the Treaty of Versailles, the Treaty of Locarno, or of certain recent bilateral Treaties signed on behalf of Canada.(d.) It is not in accordance with constitutional practice to make any reference in instruments of ratification in respect of any part of the British Empire to the advice upon which His Majesty acts.(e.) In the instrument enclosed in your despatch the actual words of ratification are unlimited by any reference to the Irish Free State. The insertion of the words &apos;&apos; in respect of Our Irish Free State&apos;&apos; after the words &apos;&apos; We do by these Presents approve, accept, confirm and ratify it&quot; would appear to be essential.6. It will be remembered that the resolution of the Imperial Conference of 1923 on the subject of the negotiation, signature and ratification of treaties, which is quoted in the.Report of the Inter-Imperial Relations Conrmittee of the Imperial Conference of 1926 (page 21 of Cmd. 2768), states that &quot;the existing practice in connection with the ratification of treaties should be maintained.&quot; In view of this Resolution and of the points referred to above, His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom feel sure that His Majesty&apos;s Government in the Irish Free State would wish that the instrument of ratification to be signed and deposited on their[18983] 1 B 2
behalf should not depart in any material respect from existing constitutional usage or from the form of the instruments of ratification signed and deposited on behalf of the United Kingdom and the other Dominions.7. His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom would be grateful for a reply to this despatch at the earliest possible moment.I have, &amp;c. (Signed) L. S. AMERY.The Minister for External Affairs, Irish Free State.(Despatch No. 47.   Confidential.)       Department of External Affairs,Sir, Irish Free State, February 18, 1929.I HAVE the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your confidential despatch No. 76 of the 16th February.2. In connection with your reference to the paragraph of the Report of the Imperial Conference which sets out the position with regard to advising His Majesty, His Majesty&apos;s Government in the Irish Free State have nothing to add to the observations contained in paragraph 2 of my confidential despatch No. 42 of the 14th February, except that the second sentence of the relevant paragraph of the Report presupposes consultation with the Dominions prior to advising His Majesty in any matter which even remotely concerns them. His Majesty&apos;s Government in the Irish Free State are glad to note that His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom are in agreement with them as to the advisability of placing the question of the constitutional position in relation to the appointment of Counsellors of State on the Agenda of the next Imperial Conference.3. The correction of the errors in His Majesty&apos;s title, in the description of the Treaty, and in the actual words of ratification, which you have been good enough to point out, have been made, and the revised instrument is enclosed herewith.4. With reference to points (c) and (d) of paragraph 5 of your despatch, His Majesty&apos;s Government in the Irish Free State do not accept the underlying suggestion that complete uniformity must exist between all the Members of the British Commonwealth of Nations in matters of constitutional practice. But is there any departure from constitutional practice involved in the additions made to the old form of ratification? It has become the accepted constitutional practice in the Irish Free State to obtain the approval of the Oireachtas for the ratification of all treaties and international agreements other than those of a purely administrative character, and this approval has been set out in the instrument. The practice, based on a vital political principle whereby- each of His Majesty&apos;s Governments advises His Majesty in its own affairs, is common to all the Members of the Commonwealth. The Irish Free State now, for the first time, has become a separate party to a Heads of State agreement. His Majesty&apos;s Government in the Irish Free State are now advising His Majesty to ratify that agreement, and the instrument of ratification refers only to the Irish Free State. We are using an old form in which we are making certain modifications to make it conform with constitutional practice. That is the complete extent of the change.5. There is, therefore, no departure from the resolution of the 1923 Conference which referred to the constitutional practice and not to the form of the instrument. There had been no separate ratification by His Majesty on behalf of a Dominion prior to that date.In this connection, His Majesty&apos;s Government in the Irish Free State wish to remind His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom that the readiness with which forms of this character are accepted depends on entirely different factors here and in Great Britain. Our people estimate their value only by the facts that they formulate; the people of Great Britain are content to accept them simply because they register a phase in their constitutional history. If that truth were accepted, I feel that our constitutional difficulties would perhaps be solved with greater ease and rapidity.I have, &amp;c. (Signed) P. McGILLIGAN,Minister for External Affairs.The Right Honourable the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, Downing Street, London, S.W. 1.
(Enclosure in Irish Free State Despatch No. 47.)GEORGE, by the Grace of God, of Great Britain, Ireland and the British Dominions beyond the Seas King, Defender of the Faith, Emperor of India, &amp;c, &amp;c, &amp;c. To all and singular to whom these Presents shall come, Greeting!Whereas a Treaty between Us, and other Powers and States, providing for the renunciation of war as an instrument of national policy, was concluded and signed at Paris on the Twenty-seventh day of August in the year of Our Lord One Thousand Nine Hundred and Twenty-eight by the Plenipotentiaries of Us and of the said Powers and States duly and respectively authorised for that purpose, and whereas the Dail and Seanad of Our Irish Free State have approved of the said Treaty, which is, word for word, as follows : And whereas the Executive Council of Our Irish Free State have advised Us to ratify the aforesaid Treaty in respect of Our Irish Free State,We, having seen and considered the Treaty aforesaid, have approved, accepted and confirmed the same in all and every one of Its Articles and Clauses, as We do by these Presents approve, accept, confirm, and ratify it in respect of Our Irish Free State, for Ourselves, Our Heirs and Successors; engaging and promising upon Our Royal Word that We will sincerely and faithfully perform and observe all and singular the things which are contained and expressed in the Treaty aforesaid, and that We will never suffer the same to be violated by anyone, or transgressed in any manner, as far as lies in Our Power. For the greater testimony and validity of all which, We have caused Our Great Seal to be affixed to these Presents, which We have signed with Our Rcyal Hand.Given at Our Court of St. James, the day of , inthe year of Our Lord One Thousand Nine Hundred and Twenty-nine, and in the Nineteenth year of Our Reign.Signed on behalf of His Majesty The King:Irish Free State. No. 89.   Confidential.Sir, Downing Street, February26, 1929.&apos; I HAVE the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your Confidential despatch No. 47 of the 18th February with regard to the instrument of ratification of the Treaty for the Renunciation of War, in respect of the Irish Free State, and to inform you that, in accordance with the advice of His Majesty&apos;s Ministers in the Irish Free State, the revised instrument enclosed in your despatch has been signed by the Queen, the Prince of Wales and the Duke of York, as Counsellors of State, on behalf of His Majesty the King. After being duly signed and sealed with the Great Seal, the instrument has been despatched on the 20th February by R.M.S. &quot; Aquitania &quot; to Washington, together with the instruments of ratification in respect of the other parts of the Empire, with the request to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Washington
that it may be handed immediately to the Irish Free State Charge d&apos;Affaires, to be held by him pending instructions from His Majesty&apos;s Government in the Irish Free State, and that he will make arrangements with the Canadian Minister and the Irish Free State Charge d&apos;Affaires for the simultaneous deposit of all, instruments of ratification as soon as the necessary instructions have been sent from Ottawa and Dublin.2. His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom would have been glad if His Majesty&apos;s Government in the Irish Free State had omitted from the preamble to this instrument the recitals relating to the approval of the Dail and Senate and the advice of the Executive Council. The difficulty arising in regard to the insertion, in existing circumstances, of these recitals is not, of course, based on any question as to the facts formulated. Nor, again, would it be questioned that the insertion of such recitals in similar instruments in future might properly form the subject of discussion between the Governments of various parts of the Empire. The point to which His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom would specially direct attention relates to the circumstances in which alterations were proposed in what has been the customary form for a very long time past. Owing to the manner in which the change has in this instance been made, the wording of His Majesty&apos;s ratification of this Treaty on behalf of the Free State differs from that of his ratifica-tions on behalf of all the other parts of his dominions, and it would be embarrassing if the United States Government were to raise any question as to one or other of the two forms employed on the ground of the distinction between them.3. Moreover, the constitutional position of the Free State in this respect is identical with that of Canada, and (at any rate so far as concerns the question of Ministerial advice) with that of the United Kingdom and the other Dominions. Changes in existing forms such as that now under discussion are therefore not a matter which concerns the Free State alone; if appropriate for one they must be appropriate for others; and, in the view of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom, they7 ought not to be made at the instance of one member of the Common-Avealth alone, but only as the result of consultation and agreement between all His Majesty&apos;s Governments, either by means of correspondence or by discussion at the Imperial Conference.4. His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom desire therefore to place on record their view that changes in existing procedure in a matter which, as in the present case, affects all His Majesty&apos;s Governments should only be made as the result of discussion and agreement between those Governments, followed, in appropriate cases, by a proper submission to His Majesty.\.     I have, &amp;c. (Signed) L. S. AMERY.The Minister for External Affairs, Irish Free State.
