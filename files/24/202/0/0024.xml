Copy No.       51330-C.(Also Paper No. COS. 184.)COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE.PIRACY IN CHINA WATERS. (Previous C.I.D. Paper No. 287-C.)Report by the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee.1. AT the instance of the Chief of the Naval Staff we have had under consideration the question of piracy in China waters, which has recently been the subject of considerable telegraphic correspondence between the Admiralty and the Commander-in-Chief, China (see Appendix I).In Enclosure No. 4 to Appendix I, the Naval Commander-in-Chief states that he is seriously perturbed about the anti-piracy problem, and he indicates that the present provision of guards is becoming too great a strain on naval personnel. On the other hand, we are informed that certain of the shipping companies have already approached the Foreign Office and have suggested that the present protection afforded by the armed forces is insufficient and should be increased.Past History of the Piracy Problem.2. In September 1927 Sir Miles Lampson forwarded to the Foreign Office a detailed memorandum on piracy in China.From this paper, which is reproduced as Appendix II, certain points emerge.3. In the first place, it is clear that piracy in China waters is an old-established institution, which is probably to-day more flourishing and more advantageous, both to the pirates and to the Chinese authorities who countenance it, than it has ever been.4. It will also be noted that His Majesty&apos;s Government have persistently endeavoured to induce the Chinese authorities to assist in affording protection to shipping, with a conspicuous lack of success, in spite of the fact that by the Treaty of Tientsin, 1858, the Chinese were bound at all times to afford the fullest protection to the persons and property of British subjects, to use every endeavour to capture and punish robbers and pirates and to recover stolen property, and to allow the necessary facilities to British ships of war engaged in the pursuit of pirates.Piracy Prevention Ordinance, 1914.5. In August 1914 the Hong Kong Government issued the Piracy Prevention Ordinance, which provided that no launch or ship, except those specially exempted by the Governor in Council, should leave the waters of the Colony for certain ports (roughly within 120 miles of Hong Kong) unless a bond had been executed, on behalf of the ship, to comply with the provisions of the Ordinance and all regulations[18746]       &apos; b
issued under it. The Ordinance and its dependent regulations conferred wide powers of search on the police, provided that ships should carry armed guards and should be fitted with bullet-proof dodgers and grilles for restricting the movement of passengers, and laid down the quantities of arms, ammunition, rockets, &amp;c, that must be carried. These regulations were never properly observed, and proved to be unpopular with the shipping companies, which considered that protection by the Navy was preferable to internal measures on board ship. The Officers of the ships were also strongly opposed to the anti-piracy regulations, and in 1924 those on board the Kong-moon boats struck, demanding the withdrawal of arms and guards from steamers on the ground that these attracted pirates who wanted arms, and asked for the establishment of a naval convoy from Hong Kong to Macao and Kong-moon to Canton. The real grievance of these officers was a clause in the anti-piracy reoula-tions which obliged them, under severe penalties, to resist pirates to the utmost, while there was no regulation providing for any compensation to their dependents it&apos; thev were killed or disabled in so doing. This was subsequently remedied on the 25th April, 1924, by a Hong Kong regulation providing for compensation in case of death or injury, and, after the strike had lasted two days, the Kong-moon traffic resumed running in convoys, protected by armed launches chartered by the Hono-Kong Government and later by the Commodore, Hong Kong, and manned by naval ratings.Inter-Departmental Conference at the Colonial Office, 1925.6. Tn January 1925 the Colonial Office forwarded to the Foreign Office a copy of a report by an Inter-Departmental Conference which had enquired into repre-sentations made by the China Coast Officers&apos; Guild and the Marine Engineers&apos; Guild of China, who had submitted various resolutions, among wffiich were the following : That the Police Department should be relieved from all duties in regard to seagoing and river steamers while outside the waters of the Colony, and centre its attention on detecting and preventing the embarkation of unlawful persons and/or firearms while the vessels were in Hong Kong;That all arms and armed guards required by the piracy^ regulations should be removed from every vessel, and that the absolute command thereof should be restored to the Master as laid down in the Merchant Shipping Acts:That there should at once be inaugurated a proper system of patrol in the danger zone;That all vessels subject to piracy regulations should have wireless telegraphy installed and under the control of a competent operator, signed on the Articles.7. The Inter-departmental Conference found that in every case of a successful piratical attack the piracy regulations had been disregarded in some essential respect. The Conference therefore felt that a case had not been made out for any radical revision of the existing regulations, and that, on the contrary, the proper course was to require full and strict compliance with them. The Indian guards supplied from Hong Kong were at first unsatisfactory, but had been formed into an organized unit under the control of the Captain Superintendent of Police, and an officer from the Indian Army had been detailed to superintend their training and discipline.8. The Conference also recommended that the Guilds should try to negotiate with the owmers to improve the status of ships&apos; officers, and pointed out that some Chinese-owned vessels which carried British officers in order to comply with the conditions requisite to obtain registration in Hong Kong engaged them on a 24-hour agreement, and the pay and compensation conditions were such that good officers could not be expected. Meanwhile, piracies continued and became even more frequent, in spite of some co-operation by the Cantonese authorities in dealing with pirates on shore.Sunning Commission.9. On the 15th November, 1926, the S.S. &quot;Sunning&quot; was pirated, and the Governor of Hong Kong, appointed a Commission of enquiry, the recommendations and conclusions of which are reproduced in Appendix III.
10. The main conclusions reached by this Commission referred to the responsi-bilities of the owners in these words : &quot; That the conditions demand precautions and an organization to resist pirates on board every vessel exposed to the risk of piracy, but that no system is worth the cost of installation or the trouble of organizing unless it is backed up by a determination to resist on the part of the owners and officers alike, who must necessarily co-operate to this end.The Government hand in the organization is openly unpopular, and in lacking the essential co-operation of owners and officers even constitutes an obstacle to the institution and development of voluntary schemes.The Piracy Prevention Regulations (1914) and 13 years&apos; experience have given a valuable lead, and the Commission is unanimously of opinion that the responsibility for internal precautions and organization should now be thrown back on the owners, who, by seeking the co-operation of their officers and considering their views, will at least be able to ensure that confidence in the arrangements which is essential.&quot;11. Recent events indicate that whilst as a result of the Sunning Commission the ship owners have obtained the freedom they desired, they, on their part, have not to the fullest extent implemented those portions of the Commission^ recommendation dealing with their own internal responsibilities.Punitive Expeditions.12. Although punitive expeditions have been tried, they have not been successful in stopping the piracies. It has not been possible to capture the responsible persons, and probably a certain amount of suffering has been caused to those altogether unconnected with piratical actions.Pressure on the Chinese to take Action.13. Suggestions have been made that any action for the suppression of piracy should be of an international character. Unfortunately, past experience points to little prospect of success. In December 1927, at the instigation of the British Minister in Peking, a series of meetings of foreign diplomats was held, at which possible international pressure on the Cantonese Government to force them to take action against the pirates was reviewed. The United States, however, did not wish to join in any note to the Chinese Government then in power nor in any naval action. The Italian Government agreed to the despatch of a note, but could not commit them-selves to naval action. The French representative stated that the attitude of the United States left his Government no option but to adopt a similar standpoint. Japan, while emphasising her willingness to co operate, stressed the importance of including in any measures for the suppression of pirates action against the base at Haichow (approximately 1,000 miles north of Hong Kong). As stated by the British Minister, the refusal of the United States &quot; put an end to any prospect there ever was of international cO-operation against piracy,&quot; and there only remained the possibility of some sort of Anglo-Japanese co-operation.In view of the close proximity of Bias Bay to Hong Kong, the most satisfactory method of operating against the pirates in conjunction with Japan would be for us to deal with Bias Bay and the Japanese wdth Haichow. This would leave the situation approximately what it was before any attempt was made to obtain international action.14. To sum up, a review of the past history of the problem would appear to show that in order to deter piracy the fullest co-operation of the ship owners and officers, which has not hitherto been obtained, is essential, as well as the continuance of naval patrolling and interception by His Majesty&apos;s ships. Further, that piracy will only be effectively eliminated when the Chinese authorities can be persuaded to take energetic action on shore. Punitive expeditions by British or Allied armed forces against pirate bases cannot, for political reasons, be of so thorough a nature as if they were carried out by the Chinese. Such punitive measures as have been instituted have, therefore, at the best only had a temporary effect.Present Situation.15.   To-day we find piracies as frequent as ever and a new and somewhat ominous development has occurred.   When the steamship &quot; Anking &quot; was recently [18746] b 2
pirated the pirates opened fire on the British officers without warning&apos;. This is we understand the first time that pirates have interfered with British personnel, unless they have actually defended themselves, and the alarm caused by this occurrence has resulted in further calls for protection by regular guards.16. The Piracy Prevention Regulations of 1914 were rescinded as a result of the &quot; Sunning&quot; Piracy Commission, and we understand that no other regulations have taken their place, except certain local legislation empowering the &quot;police to search vessels. This has resulted in a general decrease of the preventive measures previously taken by shipping companies to resist pirates.17. Indian guards are still available at Hong Kong, but are rarely utilised except by ships of the Douglas line. We note, incidentally, that whereas no cases have occurred of ships being pirated when regular naval or military guards have been on board, several piracies have occurred when the guards were Indian. This was in some cases directly due to the slackness of the Indian guards.18. Naval patrols by His Majesty&apos;s ships with a view to intercepting pirates are continually being carried out in so far as the strength of the forces allow.19. Armed guards are being provided by regular naval or military forces on British ships both on the Yangtse and coast routes as far as possible, but this involves a great strain particularly on the crews of the Yangtse gunboats. There are 21 ships on the Yangtse requiring guards of about 100 seamen and about 40 on coastal routes between Tientsin and Singapore requiring about 200 military officers and men. The Naval Commander-in-Chief has suggested that if it is considered necessary to continue these guards indefinitely a force of Royal Marines, about 300 strong, should be sent to China as part of the permanent garrison, and that they should provide all guards for coast and river shipping.20. The Commander-in-Chief further suggests that the cost should be borne by the shipping companies, who should be compelled to carry guards and pay for them until such time as they undertake to protect themselves. He points out that were it not for these guards no Chinese would dare travel or send his merchandise by sea, as in their absence piracy would undoubtedly increase out of all bounds and he therefore suggests that it should be impressed on the Nationalist Government how much they owe to British military guards and patrols.21. The Chinese authorities are taking no effective steps to deal with the pirates at their bases on shore, no doubt owing to the unstable position and ineffectual control of the present Chinese Government, and also to the national failing of the Chinese in the way of corruption.22. Most of the major piracies that have occurred have been carried out by pirates who have embarked in the ship before her departure, and may be called internal piracies. The situation to-day is that the measures in force against internal piracy are practically limited to those taken by the British Naval and Military forces, and we cannot too strongly emphasise our opinion that this is a situation which should end as soon as possible.Internal piracy is, in effect, robbery with violence on a large scale by persons for whose embarkation the shipping companies and the Police must be primarily responsible.It is therefore a matter to be dealt with by the shipping companies and the Police, and not a matter for the Naval and Military forces, who should only be called in after everything possible has been done by the Police with the interested civilian parties.In the following paragraphs we suggest proposals which may, we hope, not only relieve the British regular forces of some of the strain at present imposed on them, but also increase the security of shipping in China waters.Suggested Action by the Shipping Companies.23. We feel convinced that more covdd be done by the shipping companies to carry out preventive measures which it is well within their power to institute. Such measures should include conditions of service which will attract the best type of officer capable and ready to take all measures for the safety of their ships. Schemes should be framed for a uniform and generous scale of pension for death and wounds incurred in resisting pirates. In addition, shipping companies should ensure that ---officers engaged in trade in these waters are property armed.   We understand that
-arms are generally supplied, but they are not always carried on the person, and that, in fact, the attitude of the shipping companies is often almost one of indifference to the pirating of their ships so long as their officers and ships&apos; property are not interfered with. In the pirating of the steamship &quot;Anking&quot; the officers were attacked without warning and were not in possession of their arms. It should, in our opinion, be a definite rule that officers should carry their arms and be instructed to use them in an emergency.24. In addition, there is the question of fitting protection for the bridges and -other vital positions in ships. We realise that in some ships difficulty may arise in affording such protection, but where it is possible its installation should be under-taken as rendering successful attack less likely. In this connection we would suggest that, if such fittings contravene the existing Board of Trade regulations, the Board of Trade should be requested to consider whether modifications would not be possible, at any rate, in respect of ships operating in China waters.25. So long as guards are supplied by the Army and Navy the owners will remain content to leave to the Services the performance of the duty which should be theirs alone, and we suggest that steps should be taken to impress on the companies that it is their duty to ensure the safety of the lives and property of their passengers, Chinese as well as European, in all circumstances, and that the armed forces of the Crown should only be employed as guards when there is reliable information of an intended piracy or the Commander-in-Chief considers that the situation demands it.26. This point of view is likely to encounter vigorous opposition from the shipping companies. In a letter from John Swire and Sons to the Foreign Office, dated the 25th October, 1928, the following argument is used : &quot; We pay an excessive taxation in order that we may have the use and protection of the various Imperial services, which include the Army and Navy, and the Government are merely trying to evade their duty in making any suchsuggestions.....   The ship owners have insisted ever since piracy becameserious on the duty of the Government to provide adequate naval or military protection, and these further representations, since the &apos; Anking&apos; piracy, have merely been in continuance of that attitude.&quot;27. Under the original Piracy Regulations of 1914 Indian guards (a minimum of 4 being employed) were compulsory for all ships registered at Hong Kong. We suggest that such guards should again be insisted upon, and that steps should be taken to ensure that they are as highly trained and reliable as possible. We also suggest for consideration that the organization of similar pools of guards at other ports, such as Shanghai, should be considered.28. It is hardly for us to advise how pressure is to be exerted on the companies to ensure that they take all possible measures for the protection of their shipping. We venture to point out, however, that the Board of Trade, Foreign Office, the Colonial Office, Lloyds, The Imperial Merchant Service Guild, the China Coast Officers&apos; Guild, the Merchant Engineers&apos; Guild, and the Chinese Maritime Customs, may all be in a position to bring these matters to the serious attention of owners of ships engaged in China trade. In particular, it might be as well to enlist the sympathy and advice of the Imperial Shipping Committee, one of whose terms of reference reads as follows :  &quot; To enquire into complaints from persons and bodies interested with regard to ocean freights, facilities and conditions, in the inter-imperial trade or questions of a similar nature referred to them.....&quot;(The words &quot; inter-imperial trade &quot; have since been extended to include world-wide trade.)The Chinese Compradore.29. The part which the Chinese compradore plays in Chinese trade is an important one. Although we are fully aware that the companies are alive to this and to the assistance he can give in preventing piratical action, we suggest that more active steps might be taken to ensure his co-operation. The compradore is virtually responsible for the embarkation of all Chinese passengers. There are many loyal compradores, but piracies have occurred in which the compradore has not been above suspicion. The difficulty, however, of proving any connection between the compradore and the pirates is very great.  It is suggested that the only satisfactory
method for ensuring the loyalty of compradores to their shipping companies lies in ^ measures whereby the compradore has a considerable pecuniary interest in the safe passage of each ship. This might be arranged by compelling the compradore to make an adequate monetary deposit before the departure of each ship, this deposit being forfeited in the event of the ship being pirated. An alternative suggestion made by the late Commodore, Hong Kong, was that the compradore should receive some financial quid pro quo for eliminating undesirable passengers.30. It is possible, however, that the shipping companies may consider it inimical to their trade interests to bring pressure to bear on the compradore, and we know that the China Navigation&apos; Company in 1928 expressed the opinion&apos; that any attempt to institute a stricter system for controlling passengers, or for search for arms, would drive the passenger traffic away from British ships.Action by the Armed Forces.31. The preventive action open to His Majesty&apos;s forces consists of interception by patrols or of the provision of armed guards on board.Successful interception normally depends on the receipt of definite information with regard to a piracy or intended piracy. A standing patrol off possible pirate bases is not practicable with the force available, nor do we consider that such standing patrols, even with increased forces, could be made really effective. To keep a patrol secret in China is not possible. Further, a permanent patrol off Bias Bay would only lead to the removal of the base further to the North or South, without any inconvenience to the pirates. Reliance has, therefore, to be placed on intelligence. Information of a piracy and the calling of the assistance of His Majesty&apos;s ships requires the co-operation of the naval forces on the spot, and the shipping companies. This would involve, among other things, the institution of some form of wireless telegraphy warning, the construction in ships of a properly defended wireless telegraphy office, and the bringing into force of some form of challenge and reply. Detailed arrangements in which action by the Navy is required should, it is suggested, be left to the Commander-in-Chief.Although a permanent patrol would not effect the object of interception, an occasional patrol off the base when information of an expected piracy is received may succeed. We therefore consider that patrols by His Majesty&apos;s ships should be continued as at present in so far as the strength of the squadron in China waters allows.32. On the other hand, while recognizing that in present circumstances the provision of armed naval or military guards must continue, we strongly recommend that the shipping companies should be informed that the provision of these guards will cease in one year&apos;s time, and that the onus for the internal protection of shipping will rest on them. They would then be at liberty either to provide their own guards or to make use of the Indian guards at Hong Kong or elsewhere. These should be rendered as efficient as possible.Action by the Chinese Authorities.33. As we have already stated, piracy will never be effectively suppressed except by action taken on shore, although much can be done by the shipping companies, assisted when absolutely necessary by His Majesty&apos;s forces, to make it more risky and less lucrative than at present.The Chinese provincial authorities appear at the present time to be no more willing nor disposed towards taking action against the pirate bases than in the past. The situation has, however, been modified by the establishment at Nanking of a National Government, which is, at any rate nominally, in control of all the coastal regions affected by piracy, and which has entered into treaty relations with His Majesty&apos;s Government.34. We therefore venture to suggest that the time is opportune for making strong representations to the Chinese Central Government, from whom some form of reparation for piratical acts against British shipping should be insisted upon.35. Although past experience shows that joint action by all the foreign Powers is impracticable owing to the attitude of the United States, we understand that the Japanese Government would be prepared to act with His Majesty&apos;s Government in the matter.
36. While it must remain doubtful whether the suggested representations will achieve any appreciable success, we are of opinion that the Chinese would be fully capable of suppressing piracy if they considered it worth their while.37. In the matter of intelligence which is necessary for the successful intercep-tion of pirates at sea, close co-operation between the Chinese local authorities and the foreign police forces at the various ports is also necessary, and we suggest that, given the good will of the Chinese, considerable improvement in existing arrange-ments could be effected. This is, however, a matter on which the local authorities can best advise.Conclusions.38.   Our conclusions may be summarised as follows : (a.) We are convinced that no satisfactory action for the protection of vessels against piracy is possible without the whole-hearted co-operation of the ship-owners. This is at present lacking. We therefore suggest that pressure should be brought to bear through the medium of the interested parties, or by legislation, to make the ship-owners responsible for the protection of their ships and passengers so long as it is within their power to do so, and to cause them to implement as far as is practicable those recommendations of the Sunning Commission which concern them. The following steps we consider to be of particular importance : (i.) Improvement in the conditions of service in shipping companies so as to attract the best type of personnel. An increase of British personnel in the complement of vessels appears to be desirable.(ii.) Fitting of protection to the bridge and other vital positions in the ship.(iii.) The employment of guards, which might be organized at other ports besides Hong Kong, and which should be rendered as efficient as possible.We fully realise that these proposals are likely to be fought by the companies on the grounds of expense, and also on the excuse that the fitting of protection to the bridge, &amp;c., may contravene the Board of Trade regulations regarding access to boats.(b.) We suggest that the compradore, who is the keystone of the whole structure of shipping trade in China, should, if possible, be given a real interest in preventing pirates from coming on board. At the same time it is realised that steps likely to incur the hostility of the compradore might seriously affect the companies&apos; interests.In any case, a more rigid examination of passengers on embarkation and during the voyage would appear worthy of consideration.(c.) We agree that patrols by His Majesty&apos;s ships for the purpose of intercepting pirates should continue so far as the strength of the squadron in the Far East allows.(d.) While recognizing that for the present the provision of regular naval and military guards on board ship must continue, we strongly recommend that the shipping companies should be informed that the provision of these guards will cease in one year&apos;s time, and that they will then have to assume full responsibility for the internal protection of their ships.(e.) We suggest that the local authorities should be asked to consider how co-operation in intelligence between the various ports of call can be improved.(/.) The root of piracy is firmly embedded in Chinese soil, and piracy can only be effectively suppressed by Chinese action on shore. We therefore suggest that strong representations should be made to the Nanking-Government, if possible jointly with other foreign Powers, with a view to action being taken to this end. We suggest that the question of exacting reparation for injury to British lives or property should be considered.(Signed) H. TRENCHARD.CHARLES E. MADDEN. G. F. MILNE.2, Whitehall Gardens.

s)APPENDIX I. (i.)Telegram from Admiralty to Commander-in-Chief, China, dated November-9, 1928, No. 110.Personal, from First Sea Lord.Recent case of piracy on board steamship &quot; Shasi &quot; leads me to ask your views as to whether effective pressure cannot now be brought on harbour authorities and shipowners to prevent the embarkation of undesirable passengers and arms being smuggled on board. The difficulties are well known, but believed not to be insuperable, and I foresee the contingency that unless shipping companies can satisfy Admiralty and War Office that they have done everything possible to control the situation, protection by His Majesty&apos;s Forces will not be forthcoming. Is it any good Admiralty making representation at London offices of shipping companies concerned?   1715/9.(ii.)Telegram from Commander-in-Chief, China, to Admiralty, dated November 16, 1928, No. 579.Your 110. I have had no reason to alter view expressed in my covering letter No. 752/1034 of the 8th June, 1927, forwarding to their Lordships a copy of Sunning Piracy Commission Report. The attitude of most of the shipping companies is clearly expressed in so-called minority report of that report. I am still convinced that most of the shipping companies would prefer their ships to be pirated, their passengers robbed and their baggage looted, and that the ship, their foreign passengers and themselves should be left unharmed, rather than that officers, by putting up a defence, should run the risk of ship being damaged by fire, with consequent serious danger to foreign passengers and themselves and heavy loss to the owners.(2.) In my opinion no ship which is fitted with W/T adequately protected within a reasonably fortified and isolated bridge, and manned by resolute and vigilant officers armed and ready to defend themselves, will ever be pirated, even if pirates are first-class passengers. I consider if Admiralty can bring pressure to bear on London offices of companies concerned to adopt suggestions already put forward, a great deal will have been done towards suppression of piracy. So long as the companies maintain their present attitude that the whole responsibility rests on the navy and on the military guards, nothing will ever completely suppress piracy. End of Part 1.   Part 2 follows.   1131/16.(iii.)Telegram from Commander-in-Chief, China, to Admiralty, dated November 6, 1928, No. 580.My 579.   Following is Part 2 : Paragraph 3. While I agree that adequate control of embarkation of passengers and baggage would automatically solve whole problem, I am very doubtful whether it is feasible in practice. I believe it is possible at Hong Kong and Singapore, but it is very doubtful whether it could be satisfactorily carried out at any other coast port, even Shanghai.Paragraph 4. I am again investigating possibility of some sort of W/T reporting system in which &quot;No report&quot; would be equivalent to signal of distress, but I anticipate being met with a non possumus attitude by the shipping companies on the grounds of expense, lack of operators and general inexperience.
Paragraph 5. It is for consideration whether shipping companies might not be more inclined to assist if they were asked to pay for their naval and military guards, in accordance with K.R. &amp; A.I. 1771.Paragraph 6. It is also felt in addition to placing whole expense of provision of naval or military guards on the owners, Board of Trade Regulations governing working of British ships could be modified for the China Coast trade to include compulsory defence precautions such as detailed in Sunning Commission Report of April 1927, and that the far-reaching influence of Lloyds and other insurance corporation could exert financial pressure to gain this end.   1403/16.(iv.)Telegram from Commander-in-Chief, China, to Admiralty, dated November 29, 1928, No. 602.I am seriously perturbed about the anti-piracy problem in China. The provision of armed guards in British ships, both on Yang-tsze and coast routes, will probably prevent piracy in these ships, but we cannot go on providing guards for ever. There are 21 ships on Yang-tsze requiring guards of about 100 seamen and about 40 on coastal routes between Tientsin and Singapore requiring about 200 military officers and men. I cannot accept much longer the constant drain on crews of H.M.S. &quot;Castor&quot; at Hankow, &quot;Cornwall&quot; at Shanghai and gunboats and destroyers at their various stations, and, with further military reductions proposed, I anticipate General Officer Commanding concerned will shortly plead inability to supply guards. Further, it should not be duty of the military to provide guards for ocean-going ships, and in the weather conditions which may be expected in China Seas during winter months some of them may be incapacitated by sea sickness, but, as I was unable to provide these guards from naval sources owing to [ ? cruisers] of 5th Cruiser Squadron being already short-handed, I was compelled to suggest that military should do so. The opinion is strongly held at Hong Kong and Shanghai that it will be necessary to continue these guards indefinitely, and, if His Majesty&apos;s Government agree, I can only suggest force of Royal Marines should be sent out to China as part of permanent garrison, and that they should provide all guards for coast and river. About 300 would be required. It is realised this would be extraneous and costly, but it is emphasised that the costs should be borne by the shipping companies, who should be compelled to carry guards and pay for them until such time as they undertake to protect themselves. It should also be impressed on Nationalist Government how much they owe to British naval and military guards and patrols. Were it not for these, no Chinese would dare travel or to send his merchandise by sea, as in their absence piracy would undoubtedly increase out of all bounds. This message has been repeated to British Minister, Peking, No. 702. 1702/28.(v.)Telegram from First Sea Lord, to Commander-in-Chief, China, dated December 22, 1928, No. 202.Do Indian Guards employed under old Hong Kong Anti-Piracy Regulations still function.   If so :  (1.) Are these still under the control of Hong Kong police&apos;((2.) By whom are they maintained 1(3.) In what manner are they employed?I should be glad of your remarks on the suitability of these guards for anti-piracy wrork.   1312/22.[18746]c
(vi.)Telegram from Commander-in-Chief, China, to the Admiralty, datedDecember 25, 1928.   No. 650.Your 202. Indian guards are supplied by Hong Kong Police on application by shipping company requiring guards. They are then seconded from police and placed on ships, articles being paid and controlled by the firms. They are kept on police roster and when not employed afloat are employed on police duties ashore. I consider them suitable for river work, but not so suitable for seagoing ships, see also Sunning Commission Report. Indian guards are not popular with Butterfields and Jardine, but they are employed by Douglas Line, who find them satisfactory and do not ask for military guards.   1625/25.APPENDIX II.Memorandum respecting Piracy Suppression received from, Sir Miles Lampson with his despatch No. 1030, dated Peking, September 21, 1927.THE only relevant treaty provisions are articles 18, 19, 52 and 53 of the Treaty of Tien-tsin, 1858.Article 18 reads : &quot; The Chinese authorities shall at all times afford the fullest protection to the persons and property of British subjects, whenever these shall have been subjected to insult or violence. In all cases of incendiarism or robbery the local authorities shall at once take the necessary steps for the recovery of the stolen property, the suppression of disorder and the arrest of the guilty parties, whom they will punish according to the law.&quot;Article 19 reads : &quot; If any British merchant vessel, while within Chinese waters, be plundered by robbers or pirates, it shall be the duty of the Chinese authorities to use every endeavour to capture and punish the said robbers or pirates, and to recover the stolen property, that it may be handed over to the consul for restoration to the owner.&quot;Article 52 reads :* &quot; British ships of war coming for no hostile purpose, or being engaged in the pursuit of pirates, shall be at liberty to visit all ports within the dominions of the Emperor of China, and shall receive every facility for the purchase of provisions, procuring water, and, if occasion require, for the making of repairs. The commanders of such ships shall hold intercourse with the Chinese authorities on terms of equality and courtesy.&quot;Article 53 reads : &quot; In consideration of the injury sustained by native and foreign commerce from the prevalence of piracy in the seas of China, the high contracting parties agree to concert measures for its suppression.&quot;In August 1914 the Hong Kong Government issued the Piracy Prevention Ordinance, which provides that no launch or ship except those specially exempted by the Governor in Council shall leave the waters of the Colony for certain ports (which, roughly speaking, are all ports and places on the China coast within 120 miles of Hong Kong, together with a few ports outside that area) unless a bond has been executed on behalf of the ship to comply with the provisions of the ordinance and of all regulations issued under it. The ordinance and its dependent regulations confer wide powers of search on the police, provide that ships shall carry armed guards and shall be fitted with bullet-proof dodgers and grilles for restricting the movements of passengers, and lay down the quantities of arms, ammunition, rockets, &amp;o, that must be carried.
11325There is little reference to piracy in the archives since the war until the year 1922. On the 19th November of that year the steamship &quot; Sui An &quot; was pirated a little way out of Macao on the way to Hong Kong. The ship was taken to Bias Bay and eventually released. This piracy was considered by a commission at Hong Kong,.which issued a report on the 26th January, 1923. The effect of the report was to recommend the repeal of the existing piracy regulations issued by the Hong Kong Government and the substitution from which the following classes of ocean-going steamers should be exempt: (a.) Those carrying wireless and a non-Chinese crew.(b.) Those carrying wireless, no matter what the nationality of the crew, provided that the passenger capacity was not more than fifty.The commission recognised that arrangements on board individual ships formed only part of what was necessary in order to cope with piracy, and recommended (1.) That there should be a system of patrols in conjunction with the Portuguese and Chinese, and that, if possible, the patrols should be in wireless communication with each other.(2.) That the local authorities in Macao and the Chinese ports should be requested to conduct a search of passengers both on arrival and departure, and of their luggage, at least as stringent as the search conducted at Hong Kong.The report concluded: &apos;&apos; Whatever measures are adopted in the Colony to prevent piracy, their success will only be partial until public order is firmly established in the neighbouring Chinese territories. The root of the evil is outside the waters of the Colony.&quot;On the 7th November, 1923, a Chinese steam launch called the &quot;Lee Fat&quot; wras pirated between Hong Kong and Macao and the passengers taken off. Although this piracy did not apparently involve any British subject or British interest, the Governor of Hong Kong requested the consul-general at Canton to ask the Canton authorities to take steps to discover the whereabouts of the passengers, to secure their release and punish the perpetrators of the piracy. Sir R. Stubbs added that he proposed to place before the Secretary of State for the Colonies the view that if the provincial authorities were unable or unwilling to take vigorous action His Majesty&apos;s forces might properly be employed to exact retribution from the pirates. Before doing this lie requested the consul-general&apos;s observations. The consul-general, in reply, pointed out that in the case both of the &quot; Sui An &quot; and the &quot; Lee Fat &quot; pirates had come on board the vessels in territory under British police supervision. It was open to the Chinese, therefore, to plead contributory negligence on the British side in that no steps were taken to search persons embarking on the ships for arms. As to &quot; exacting retribution,&quot; he pointed out there was no objection to action, afloat, but that an offer of co-operation in a shore-landing was likely to be refused, as it had been on a certain occasion a few years previously. It was also not likely to commend itself to His Majesty&apos;s Government.In reply, the Governor explained himself a little more fully. The Commander-in-chief was prepared, he said, to co-operate with the Chinese authorities in rescuing prisoners and arresting pirates. Alternatively, if the provincial authorities were unable or unwilling to co-operate, the Comrnander-in-chief was prepared, subject to the approval of His Majesty&apos;s Government, to use British forces to capture pirate villages, to release prisoners and hand over captured pirates to the Chinese provincial authorities for punishment.The idea went no further at that time, as the Legation agreed with the consul-general, Canton, that in the case of the &quot;Lee Fat,&quot; at all events, His Majesty&apos;s forces could not be expected to take action on shore, either in co-operation with the Chinese or alone.There were considerable developments in 1924, originating in the piracy on the 27th December, 1923, of the British coasting steamer &quot; Hydrangea.&quot; In this case the passengers are said to have been searched on embarkation at Hong Kong, and there were Indian guards on board. One hour out of Hong Kong, howrever, on the way to Swatow, the Indian guards were overpowered and the ship taken to Bias Bay, where she was released after the cargo had been removed.In reporting this, the Governor of Hong Kong said that owing to a customs dispute with the Canton authorities the moment was evidently not favourable for [18746] c 2
co-operation with them, but he asked the Colonial Office whether, when the customs dispute blew over, he might be authorised to put before the Canton authorities a proposal for a joint expedition against pirates.The reaction of this proposal on the Foreign Office was somewhat curious. They did not raise any objection to the proposed expedition in itself; in fact, in a telegram to the Legation of the 10th January, 1924, they said they would welcome the extermination of pirates, but they feared that co-operation with the Canton authorities without the sanction of the Central Government might give rise to a misunderstanding amongst the Chinese and foreign Powers. It would also be inconsistent with His Majesty&apos;s Governments policy of non-intervention and non-recognition.On the 13th January, 1924, Sir R. Macleay replied to the Foreign Office that he did not think co-operation with de facto authorities inconsistent with our policy  if such co-operation were genuinely welcomed by those authorities and confined to piracy suppression. He saw no objection to proposing co-operation provided that the proposals were not pressed unduly if the Chinese showed reluctance, and that our part should be confined as far as possible to operations afloat.The situation was altered by two further piracies on the 19th and 21st January respectively. On the 19th January two Asiatic Petroleum Company^ s launches were pirated, and on the 21st January the British steamship &quot; Tai Lee&quot; was pirated by men who embarked as passengers at Hong Kong. In the case of the &quot; Tai Lee &quot; the crew were also implicated. On the 24th January the consul-general, Canton, reported that co-operation was desirable, and that the Chinese themselves had made certain informal proposals to that effect to Hong Kong and the senior naval officer, Canton. Chinese co-operation would scarcely be effective, but Hong Kong would be satisfied if a Chinese gunboat with Chinese troops were detailed for a joint expedition for the sake of appearance. The senior naval officer, Canton, thought, however, that even in such a case the operations should be confined to the water and that no landing should be attempted by British forces.On the 25th January the Governor of Hong Kong telegraphed that the Secretary^ of State for the Colonies had approved the principle of co-operation with the Canton authorities, and he was accordingly asking the consul-general, Canton, to propose it.Meanwhile the Commander-in-chief (Admiral Leveson) discussed the question of piracy in a despatch, dated the 20th January, in connection with the suggested increase of the West River and Canton Delta patrols. He pointed out that the most recent acts of.piracy had all been carried out by men who had boarded the ships at the port of departure. Some different form of supervision was therefore necessary at embarkation, but anything of this sort was sure to be objected to because it would cause delay and hamper trade. The best course was to search out the pirates and attack them in their nests. He was quite ready to do this if the Foreign Office agreed, though he thought that, in the circumstances of the moment, co-operation with Canton was out of thequestion. On the 31st January Sir Ronald Macleay telegraphed privately to the Commander-in-chief, agreeing that existing circumstances were unpropitious for co-operation, and expressing the view that close inspection of Chinese passengers at embarkation would be the thing to aim at.Nothing seems to have been done, however, to deter the Governor of Hong Kong from submitting his proposal for a joint expedition to the Canton authorities.As a further measure, the Governor proposed to the commodore on the 18th February that a system of convoying should be introduced experimentally on the two principal river routes, Hong Kong-Canton and Hong Kong-Kongmoon. Commenting on this proposal, the senior naval officer, Canton, expressed the view to the consul-general, Canton, that it would be impracticable owing to the large number of armed craft which would be needed. The better and cheaper method, in his view, was to strengthen the guards on the ships then carrying them and to insist on other ships carrying guards. Gunboats should be kept for patrolling, not convoying.On the 1st March, 1924, the consul-general, Canton, reported that, with the approval of the Commander-in-chief and the Governor of Hong Kong, and after con-sultation with Mr. King, the deputy superintendent of police at Hong Kong, he and the senior naval officer, Canton, had proceeded with the idea of co-operation with the Chinese. Before the question had been broached to the Chinese, a discussion had taken place about the landing of foreign troops, and it was agreed that such landing, whether of naval ratings, soldiers or Hong Kong police, was undesirable.  The senior
1332Snaval officer, Canton, said it was impracticable from the naval point of view, while the consul-general, Canton, felt sure that the Canton authorities would object and that any landing would give rise to strong anti-British feeling locally.On the 29th February an interview took place with C. C. Wu, who was asked whether the Canton authorities were prepared in principle to assent to informal discussions to arrange mutual co-operation in suppressing piracy. Mr. Wu welcomed the principle of co-operation. The senior naval officer explained that the British proposed to limit the activities of British gunboats to towing or convoying Chinese troops, to standing by during an action and to covering the movements of Chinese troops with British guns. We did not propose to land troops. Mr. Wu replied that he was against the landing of troops, but promised to refer the question of other forms of co-operation to the military and police commandants in Canton. Quick progress was made, and in an interview between the consul-general, Canton, and the new Civil Governor on the 12th March the latter said it was proposed to make expeditions against three pirate centres (1.) Near the mouth of the East River. (2.) In the Pearl River delta.(3.) In the Mahning area, west of Macao (the last-named with the co-operation of aeroplanes).At this interview it was made clear on the Chinese side that, whilst British naval assistance was welcomed, the Chinese military authorities desired to avoid creating anything in the nature of a precedent and wished to conduct the matter on a strictly informal basis. The consul-general agreed, and said that we on our side wished to make co-operation as inconspicuous as possible.Further interviews followed with Mr. Eugene Chen, then representing Sun Yat-sen&apos;s general headquarters. In one of these interviews, in reply to a statement by the consul-general that we did not propose to land troops, Eugene Chen, while agreeing in principle, said that cases might arise when a landing-party on a limited scale might be useful. The senior naval officer said that he would be prepared to comply with a request to that effect by the Chinese officer in command of the expedition. On the British side, it was suggested that one form of co-operation might be the supply of coal by Hong Kong for Chinese gunboats. Later, Eugene Chen asked for the loan of a number of modern rifles for exclusive use in connection with piracy; also for the loan of two British naval officers to train a special anti-piracy force and the loan of a supply ship for aeroplanes. The consul-general said he would refer these requests to the Legation. There is nothing to show that any reply was ever sent to them, but the discussions resulted in a joint expedition on the 20th March against a pirate lair near the mouth of the East River. This resulted in the capture of over forty pirates, the destruction of several ships and the release of over twenty captives. The operation was actually carried out by three Chinese gunboats and Chinese troops. H.M.S. &quot; Tarantula &quot; accompanied the expedition and stood by the whole time, but was not called upon to give active support. In reporting the success of this operation, the consul-general, Canton, said that the Chinese had probably taken our offer of co-operation as a mild hint that if they did not take action we should be compelled in self-defence to undertake the task.A further operation by Chinese troops, accompanied and observed by H.M.S. &quot; Moth,&quot; took place oh the 23rd March.On the 3rd April a Portuguese steamer &quot; Seixal &quot; was pirated in the Mahning area, after three of its Indian guards had been killed. The consul-general, Canton, urged the Chinese authorities to send an expedition to clear up this district.On the 8th April General. Li Fuk Lam (Li Fu Lin) destroyed the village of Cheung Chow (not in the Mahning area but near Whampoa).On the 11th April the British steamship &quot; Tai Lee &quot; was again attacked by pirates, who, however, were repulsed by the Indian guards on board under a British police officer.This was followed by a strike of the officers on the Kongmoon boats until the Hong Kong Government acceded to their demands concerning piracy. These demands were the withdrawal of guards and arms from steamers (on the ground that these attracted pirates who wanted arms) and the establishment of a naval convoy from Hong Kong to Macao and Kongmoon to Canton. (The real grievance of the officers was a clause in the anti-piracy regulations of the Hong Kong Govern-ment which obliged them under severe penalties to resist pirates to the utmost; while there was no regulation providing for any compensation to their dependents if they
were killed or disabled in so doing. This was subsequently remedied on the 25th April by a Hong Kong regulation providing for compensation&apos; in case of death or injury.) After the strike had lasted two days the Kongmoon boats resumed running with a convoy of armed launches chartered by the commodore and manned by naval ratingsOn the 23rd April the Civil Governor replied to the consul-general, Canton in an official note that General Li Fu Lam had been instructed to pursue the pirates in the Maiming area in co-operation with a Chinese naval commander and genera!, and &quot; with the British gunboats.&quot;In the meantime correspondence had taken place regarding the supply of British infantry to act as guards. On the 22nd March, 1924, the General Officer Commanding, Hong Kong, telegraphed to the War Office that the Governor had requested him to furnish a daily detachment of forty infantry to travel as guards on merchant ships between Hong Kong, Canton and Kongmoon, for two or three months pending the training of a civil police guard. The War Office were at first adverse from cementing, and asked the Admiralty whether they considered this really-necessary. The Admiralty replied by forwarding extracts from two reports by the Commander-in-chief, dated^ the 30th-November, 1923, and the 23rd January, 1924, respectively. In the one he said that, owing to the peculiar nature of the piracies,&apos; the first step necessary was some form of civil legislation to enforce an adequate search of all passengers. In the other, he repeated that the only method of dealing with piracy was : (1.) Increased supervision at the port of embarkation. (2.) More efficient guards and restrictions on board. (3.) Improvement of the type of British officers carried.Apart from these preventive measures, there were reprisals. He was prepared to hunt down the pirates if the Hong Kong Government would co-operate, and if His Majesty&apos;s Government permitted attacks on Chinese territory.The War Office adhered to their refusal of the request for troops, but as their refusal was apparently based on the possibility of political complications, the Colonial Office asked the Foreign Office whether the employment of British troops for the protection of merchant shipping against piratical attacks would be open to political objection. The Foreign Office replied on the 19th. April, 1924, that there would be no objection provided the guards were not allowed to land in Chinese territory outside British occupation. They pointed out that on the Yang-tsze armed guards had already been placed on American and Chinese ships. On the 23rd April, 1924, therefore, Hong Kong was instructed that British troops might be employed with the proviso laid down by the Foreign Office.On the 26th April the Governor of Hong Kong telegraphed that the Canton authorities were hampered by lack of pistols in making surprise attacks on pirate centres, and asked if there was any objection to lending them pistols on condition that they were used solely for work of this nature. The suggestion was turned down by the Foreign Office as being liable to be construed as a breach of the arms embargo and open to other objections.During May 1924 it was arranged with Mr. Eugene Chen that coal should be supplied from Hong Kong for use in suppressing piracy.On the 26th May, 1924, the chairman of the Associated British Chambers of Commerce in China and Hong Kong communicated to His Majesty&apos;s consul-general at Shanghai a resolution passed by the chamber urging &quot; His Majesty^&apos;s Government to make arrangements with the proper Chinese authorities whereby immediately a piracy is reported, punitive measures may be taken against the pirates by His Majesty&apos;s navy in the locality where they have landed. Further, the conference strongly advocates an increase in the number of naval vessels available for patrol work, especially in the Canton delta and neighbouring waters where frequent and successful piracies clearly indicate that existing patrols are inadequate.&quot;On the 21st June, Mr. Eugene Chen saw the senior naval officer, Canton, and consul-general, and asked for the active co-operation of a British gunboat in the Manning area, including the landing of a British force. It was explained to him that this was impossible on any considerable scale, but British ships could tow or convoy Chinese troops to their destination, cover their advance with gunfire, and land a few men with machine guns to lend support if required. The senior naval officer suggested that a responsible Chinese official should be placed on board H.M.S. &quot; Tarantula &quot; to point out places to be attacked.
The co-operative attack took place on the 23rd June, 1924. The British gunboats &quot; Cicala &quot; and &quot; Robin &quot; co-operated with Chinese gunboats in attacking six pirate villages north-east of Kongmoon. The operation was not, however, a great success, as the Chinese admiral seemed too scared to do anything, and the British gunboats were not, in fact, allowed to co-operate actively. The senior naval officer, Canton, expressed, his private view to the consul-general that no real good could be done without land forces.On the 17th June, 1924, an inter-departmental meeting was held at the Colonial Office to consider the measures taken by the Hong Kong Government to deal with piracy. The meeting was called with the object of discussing a letter from the Imperial Merchant Service Guild of the 12th March, 1924, criticising the Hong-Kong piracy regulations from the point of view of the obligations which they placed on officers.On the 10th July, 1924, a further meeting was held at the Colonial Office between representatives of the Colonial Office, Foreign Office, Admiralty, Board of Trade, and Government of Hong Kong, and representatives of the Imperial Merchant Service Guild, the Marine Engineers&apos; Association, and the China Coast Navigating and Engineer Officers&apos; Guild. The basis of discussion was a set of resolutions recorded in a letter of the 4th February, 1924, from the China Ccast Officers&apos; Guild to the Colonial Secretary, Hong Kong.At the two meetings at the Colonial Office the possibilities of wireless as a means of preventing piracy had been discussed. On the 22nd July the Association of Wireless and Cable Telegraphists wrote to the Colonial Office pointing out that the best preventive measure against piracy was to have wireless with efficient European operators. They showed that automatic wireless would not meet the case. There would have to be stations on the lookout for automatic messages which, in themselves, would be useless unless they gave details and showed the exact position of the ship sending out the message. The latter also urged that Chinese should not be employed, as it could never be certain that they wrere not in league themselves with the pirates.The energetic campaigns by General Li Fuk Lam were interfered with in August 1924 by the political situation (strikes, &amp;c).On the 17th September the senior naval officer, Canton, reported further operations by General Li Fuk Lam. His Majesty&apos;s gunboats had stood by and blocked a means of escape, but had taken no active part. On the 18th September the consul-general, Canton, reported that 250 tons of coal were being supplied to the general, and 250 tons more were going to be supplied. On the 28th September H.M.S. &quot; Robin &quot; sank a pirate launch by gunfire and captured another, and on the 8th October the consul-general, Canton, reported that the part of the Delta which was under General Li&apos;s control was practically clear.Meanwhile, on the 23rd September 1924, General Li Fuk Lam said that the pirate gangs were scattering and that the worse offenders were taking refuge in Hcng Kcng and Macao until it was safe for them to resume. An interview was accordingly arranged between his representative and the superintendent of the Hong-Kong police, and arrangements w-ere made for the generaFs detectives to proceed to Flong Kong and co-operate with the Hong Kong police. On the 4th Octcber the Governor of Hong Kong- wrote to the Governor of Macao recommending a similar understanding between General Li Fuk Lam and the Macao police as had been come to in Hong Kong.In a report for October 1924 the senior naval officer, Canton, mentioned that, as a result of co-operation between the Hong Kong Police and General Li Fuk Lam&apos;s detectives, three notorious pirates had been arrested in Hong Kong territory and turned over to General Li. The latter was about to resume his anti-piracy campaign now that the political situation in Canton had returned to normal. His main want was money to keep up launches and an intelligence service. The only practical way to deal with piracy was to back him up. Patrols could do a lot, but they could not get at the root of the trouble on shore. In normal times the merchants might put up money, but they were being bled to such an extent that they could not contribute. He suggested, therefore, that Hong Kong Government should put up a monthly sum, say, 15,000 or 20,000 dollars, to be handed over to the British consul-general or the British naval authorities to expend as they thought best (a) to buy coal;lb) to hire launches;(c) to pay for secret detective work.The scheme could always be abandoned at any time if found unsatisfactory.
This suggestion was supported by the consul-general, who, in a further despatch on the 14th November, reported further operations by General Li Fuk Lam, and said that the general had now been entrusted with the task of piracy suppression throughout the Province of Ewangtung.On the 20th November, the Governor of Hong Kong agreed to grant a credit of 15,000 dollars to be expended under the supervision of the consul-general in assisting General Li. Further sums would depend on proof that the grant was being effectively expended. The Governor also offered, if necessary, to send the captain-superintendent of police at Hong Kong to Canton to discuss anti-piracy measures.In November General Li proposed to the senior naval officer, Canton, a combined sweep to destroy armed pirate launches and a body of pirates, estimated at about 300, and well armed with small guns and about 30 machine guns. The operation took place on the 24th November, and His Majesty&apos;s ship &quot;Robin &quot; actually took part, firing on a village and seizing a junk. Other British gunboats blocked the ways of escape by water. The operation would have been more successful had not a subordinate Chinese officer given the game away by landing troops several hours too soon.On the 26th December the Commander-in-chief forwarded to the Governor of Hong Kong a report by the senior naval officer, Canton, with which he expressed general agreement, on piracy in the Canton delta. The senior naval officer observed that when co-opjeration was first suggested it wTas obvious that the Chinese officials were suspicious of our motives. There was still a strong party against co-operation. Nevertheless, a good deal had been done. The political situation had prevented British naval forces from doing very much. &quot; Starting from the Shameen bomb outrage, and passing through the Shameen strike to the volunteer arms question, and concluding with the burning of parts of Canton and the arming of the Canton merchants&apos; volunteers, there was hardly a breathing space.&quot; Nevertheless, British gunboats had been active in patrolling, in searching for and attacking pirates and their craft. They could never, however, deal with gangs that worked entirely from the shore, attacked small craft and then retired into the hills or up small creeks. The value of gunboats must be chiefly preventive. The existing anti-piracy methods were  -(1.) British gunboats.(2.) Armed launches; the senior naval officer recommended that these should beemployed not in convoying as at present, but in patrolling. (3.) Armed guards; effective, but unpopular with ships&apos; officers. (4.) Grilles; inconvenient.(5.) Police inspection and searchers; most valuable, as practically all attempted piracies had been on ships outward bound from Hong Kong.The senior naval officer recommended more launches for patrolling, manned by R.N. officers and men. The Commander-in-chief, however, said this was impracticable-able as there was no prospect of the necessary personnel being available.The senior naval officer also commented unfavourably on the type of officers in the delta. They were not, he said, always in a fit state to deal with any situation that might arise.On the 22nd January, 1925, the Colonial Office forwarded to the Foreign Office a copy of a report by an interdepartmental conference on piracy in the waters adjacent to the Colony^ of Hong Kong. The conference consisted of representatives of the Colonial Office, Foreign Office, and Admiralty, and the Assistant Colonial Secretary, Hong Kong.The business of the conference was to enquire into representations made by the China Coast Officers&apos; Guild, and the Marine Engineers&apos; Guild of China, whose views were embodied in the following resolutions of the 3rd February, 1924 : (1.) That, in so far as piracy prevention is concerned, the police department be relieved from all duties in regard to sea-going and river steamers whilst outside the waters of the colony and concentrate its attention on detecting and preventing the embarkation of unlawful persons and/or firearms whilst those vessels are in Hong Kong unless some better method is devised.(2.) That all arms and armed guards required by the piracy regulations be removed from every vessel and the absolute command thereof restored to the master, as laid down in the Merchant Shipping Acts, unless some better method is devised.
(3.) There shall be at once inaugurated a proper system of patrol in the danger zone.(4.) That all vessels subject to piracy regulations shall have wireless telegraphy installed and under the control of a competent operator signed on the articles.(5.) That insurance be automatically effected for every master, officer and engineer whose duty takes him into the danger zone, the premium for such insurance to be paid with the money at present paid as wages to the guards in the event of them being removed from the vessels.(6.) That every case of piracy shall be the subject of enquiry at the harbour office as soon as possible after the outrage with the harbour-master as president of the court, which should consist of active mercantile marine officers of both departments with the addition of one active naval officer.(7.) That a substantial reward be offered for information which leads to the arrest of any person implicated in any piratical attack.(8.) That a reward should be paid in all cases of seizure of arms and ammunition.The conference attributed piracy to civil war, which had completely disrupted the policing by the Chinese authorities of the Canton Delta and the neighbouring waters. The only effective measure was to destroy the pirate lairs. In view of the fact that the landing on Chinese territory of British military and naval forces for such a purpose Was out of the question, the conference recommended that the fullest possible use be made of opportunities to co-operate with the Chinese authorities.In existing circumstances, however, it would be vain to expect anything approaching the complete suppression of pirate bands. As effective a system as possible of precautionary measures should be devised and maintained.The guild had proposed in effect that the existing defensive measures should be entirely replaced by naval patrols. The Admiralty, however, had pointed out objections to this, and the conference thought that the situation was not so serious as suggested by them in overruling these objections.Convoying was useful and desirable in special circumstances, but its general adoption for any considerable time would be a hindrance to trade and would create widespread dissatisfaction. The conference therefore considered that, in addition to co-operation with the local Chinese authorities and the maintenance of as efficient a system of patrols as was possible with the available resources of the naval authorities, defensive measures on board were vitally necessary.Though the guild had raised various objections to the existing piracy regula-tions, it had been found that in every case of a successful piratical attack the piracy regulations had been disregarded in some essential respect. The conference therefore felt that a case had not been made out for any radical revision of the existing regulations, and that, on the contrary, the proper course was to require full and strict compliance with them.The guards were at first unsatisfactory, but they had now been formed into an organised unit under the control of the captain superintendent of police, and an officer from the Indian Army had been detailed to superintend their training and discipline.The conference considered that there was force in the plea of the guilds that while officers should recognise that it was their duty to defend their ship, they should not be required to resist &quot; to the utmost.&quot; They recommended that these words be deleted from the piracy regulations.The report discussed the conditions under which officers were called upon to serve on local runs. It quoted some remarks by the naval intelligence officer in the &quot; Tai Lee &quot; case, to the effect that the idea of the owners was that British officers were a necessary evil and must be made to cost as little as possible. The officers were on a twenty-four-hour agreement and the pay and compensation conditions were such that good officers could not be expected. These remarks did not apply to European-controlled ships, but to Chinese-owned vessels which carried British officers in order to comply with conditions requisite to obtain registration in Hong*Kong.The conference recommended that the guilds should try to negotiate with the owners to improve the status of officers.The conference agreed that the chances of dealing with piracy would be increased if ships were fitted, with wireless. The difficulty was to find accommodation for wireless apparatus and personnel and to pay for them. There were objections to any-automatic apparatus, since there would have to be stations waiting to pick up automatic signals, and no signal would be effective which merely reported the fact of[18746] d
a piracy without describing the exact position of the ship. Some form of semi-automatic apparatus was possible and tests were being carried out.The conference recommended that the fitting of some form of wireless apparatus and the carrying of trained operators should be made obligatory in all ships subject to the piracy regulations, and that as a corollary the Admiralty should be asked to consider what steps should be taken to render naval vessels patrolling the danger zone continuously capable of receiving distress calls from river steamers; but that the question of the type of apparatus to be prescribed should be deferred.The conference entirely approved the view of the guilds that proper provision should be made for the dependents of officers injured or killed in resisting pirates. They referred to the announcement of the Hong Kong Government of the 25th April, 1924, concerning the Government grant. They called attention, however, to the paragraph in the announcement stating that this was not intended to relieve shipping companies of their responsibilities in the matter of the insurance of officers, but was intended to supplement the companies&apos; arrangements.The conference agreed with this principle that the responsibility should rest with the shipowners and not with the Government. They considered that the guilds should endeavour to induce the companies to institute a system of insurance voluntarily. If they remained obdurate, the Hong Kong Government should consider the question of obliging them to insure officers or to defray the cost of a Government scheme.Meanwhile the Governor of Hong Kong had already appointed a local committee in December 1924 to consider the specific modification of the piracy regulations. This consisted of the assistant harbour-master, the Crown solicitor, the officer commanding-Indian guards, a representative of British shipowners, a representative of Chinese shipowners, and the secretary of the China Coast Officers&apos; Guild. The last three, however, objected to the restricted scope of the enquiry and wanted it altered so that the whole question of piracy could be discussed. As the Governor would not agree they withdrew, and in January 1925 submitted a &quot;minority report &quot; (there never was any ma j ority report).This &quot;minority report&quot; condemned the existing piracy regulations on the ground that they threw the responsibility for defence against the pirates on the mercantile marine instead of on the navy. It pointed out the grilles with which the ship had to be provided were in conflict with Board of Trade regulations and a grave source of danger. It condemned the guards, of whom some 900 were employed at a cost to the shipping of about 270,000 dollars per annum, as &quot; undisciplined and inefficient,&quot; and said that, being under the orders of the police, they derogated from the authority of the master of the ship. Briefly, the report urged that, if the guards were withdrawn, grilles removed (except those round the engine-room and bridge), an adequate fleet of patrol craft provided and police supervision, both ashore and in the harbour, materially reinforced, there should be little to fear from piratical attacks in the future.In a letter of the 14th January the minority report wras unanimously approved by the Hong Kong Chamber of Commerce, which expressed the view that it was urgently necessary to proceed, with the assistance of the Admiralty, with a scheme for the improved protection of the Canton River, delta and the coastal danger zone by means of increasing naval patrols; and to take into consideration at the same time the reasonable modification of the piracy regulations.In a letter dated the 28th January to the Governor of Hong Kong, the Commander-in-chief agreed that the grille system, whatever its value from the point of view of piracy prevention, was a danger to the safety of passengers in case of accidents, and did not apparently comply wdth Board of Trade regulations. As regards police guards, the Commander-in-chief said that, pending better safeguards, they were absolutely necessary, but must be under the command of the master of the ship. As to protection by the navy, the Commander-in-chief agreed that additional armed launches might be effective as regards river traffic, but coastal traffic north and south of Hong Kong would not be affected.In sending all this to the Colonial Office, the Governor of Hong Kong said with regard to grilles that the system was largely makeshift. He proposed to examine the practicability of enforcing permanent structural alterations which would attain the end in view without contravening Board of Trade regulations, but he anticipated opposition from the shipowners on the ground of expense. The Governor said, however, that the important question was the general one, whether protection against piracy was to be afforded solely by patrol vessels, as the minority report recommended, or by a combination of patrols and protective measures on board individual ships.
The Governor held the latter view. No system of patrols was sufficient unless the ships were prepared to defend themselves against attack from within. At the same time the greater the number of patrol vessels the smaller the risk of piracy. He recommended that the Admiralty be urged, in the interests of British prestige and trade, to strengthen the naval forces so as to allow of the extension of the patrol system.According to the &quot;China Year Book,&quot; the Colonial Office appears to have notified the Hong Kong Chamber of Commerce later that, on the information before it and after carefully considering the &quot;minority report,&quot; they saw no grounds for modifying the conclusions of the inter-departmental conference.On the 26th January, 1925, the Foreign Office telegraphed to the Legation to ask if we were satisfied that the subsidy to General Li Fuk Lam, which the Governor of Hong Kong had authorised, was a legitimate extension of the policy of co-opera-tion with the Canton authorities laid down by the inter-departmental conference. In reply to our request for observations, the consul-general, Canton, explained how the system worked. The first joint expedition had been arranged on the 9th December, 1924, and the plans had been fixed after discussion with the British naval authorities and the captain-superintendent of the Hong Kong police. It had been agreed that whilst Chinese troops should attack pirate lairs on shore, His Majesty5s ships should stand by and cut off fugitives attempting to retreat by water. The cost of coal and other supplies for the Chinese launches concerned had been calculated at 5.000 dollars and this sum handed over. The balance available had been similarly spent, and the consul-general considered the result justified the extension of the grant. The total number of pirates accounted for during the December quarter, 1924, was 166, and the return up to the 15th January, 1925, &quot;was forty. Piratical attacks had also declined. He considered co-operation essential, as, if British troops were unable to land, Chinese troops must be used, and they could only be bought. He understood that Hong Kong had in a similar way bought the co-operation of Chinese troops under General Ch&apos;en Chiung-Ming for an attack on Bias Bay after the pirating of the &quot; Hong Hwa.&quot;The Legation concurred in the consul-general5s views.On the 6th February the senior naval officer, Canton, pointed out that there were two courses open : (1.) Protection of shipping by means of convoys, armed guards, &amp;c. (2.) To attempt to stamp out the evil at its source.No. (1) was a negative policy. Important vessels flying the British flag might be protected, but piracy on small craft and craft under Chinese and foreign flags would continue. If unchecked the pirates would gain more and more confidence, and at any moment might desert the lesser prey and stage a really big piracy. No. (2) depended entirely on friendly co-operation between the local Chinese officials and the British navy. It required strong land forces and detective services. Also co-opera-tion between the detectives and police of Hong Kong and Macao with those of the anti-piracy forces. In time a big organisation might be built up, but time and money were essential.On the 23rd April the Foreign Office, in despatch No. 262, asked that the question of money payments to the Chinese authorities might be reconsidered. The application of the policy of co-operation approved by His Majesty&apos;s Government must, of course, be left to the discretion of the authorities on the spot, but the latter should be extremely circumspect in exercising it. The general danger of co-operation was that by giving colour to the idea that Hong Kong was being used as a base for interference in Chinese affairs, anti-British propaganda might be increased among the Chinese and suspicion aroused even in the minds of foreign Governments. A particular danger was that ill-disciplined soldiers and irresponsible officials might execute captives without taking the trouble to establish their guilt in accordance with British principles of justice. Joint operations, therefore, involved His Majesty5s Government in some risk. As to money payments they might lead to a kind of blackmail (the Chinese deliberately immobile except when paid to move). In addition it was a question whether it did not increase the risk of His Majesty&apos;s Government beyond the justifiable limit. The Foreign Office doubted whether it ought to be continued as a regular practice.This despatch was supplemented by a semi-official letter of the 5th May from Mr. &quot;Waterlow to Sir J. Jamieson (Canton), saying that the Foreign Office were getting exercised about anti-piracy measures, and in view of possible public criticism [18746] D 2
were rather averse from getting involved in responsibility for what was done by the Chinese. He suggested that British responsibility should be limited as far as possible for example, by confining help to water and not putting landing parties on shore.On the 11th May the Colonial Office expressed the view to the Foreign Office that it was doubtful whether in the absence of financial assistance local Chinese commanders could be persuaded to undertake operations. In order to diminish the spread of the idea that Hong Kong was being used as a base for interference in China all funds should be handed over through His Majesty&apos;s consul-general at Canton. (There was some ground for believing that in the case of the &quot;Hong Hwa &quot; punitive expedition it had been paid by Hong Kong direct.) It was also for consideration whether, when time permitted, combined operations should only be undertaken with the concurrence of His Majesty&apos;s consul at Canton.On the 1st July, 1925, the consul-general, Canton, reported that after recent happenings in Canton it was most improbable that there would be a further co-operation.The &quot;Hong Hwa,&quot; a Chinese-owned vessel, but registered in Hong Kong, and, therefore, flying the British flag, was pirated from within between Singapore and Hong Kong on the 13th January. She carried wireless, but the set was put out of action. She carried no guards and was not protected against piracy, as she did not come under the Hong Kong Piracy Regulations. The ship was taken to Bias Bay to which the pirates belonged, though they had made their plans in Singapore. It happened that Colonel Wong Fuk Chi, the Chinese commander of the Bias Bay district, was in Hong Kong with another Chinese general at the time when the piracy was committed, and a- combined Sino-British punitive expedition to Bias Bay was organised. Members of the navy, army and police in Hong Kong went with Colonel Wong to Bias Bay on the 17th January in a naval tug. They there joined Wong&apos;s soldiers, and raids were made on four villages, several houses being burnt. Apparently Colonel Wong was paid for this, but in a letter to Mr. Waterlow on the 1st July the consul-general, Canton, said that the &quot;Hong Hwa&quot; affair was entirely under the control of the Hong Kong Government and had nothing to do with the West River Patrol. In a despatch on the 9th July, the consul-general said he had no knowledge of the punitive expedition until after the event. He could not in any case have got into touch with the general commanding troops in the Bias Bay district (General Ch&apos;en Chiung Ming), as that general was at war with Canton. So far as he was concerned, payments had been confined to General Li Fuk Lam for tire specific purpose of suppressing piracy in the Canton Delta.The &quot; Hong Hwa&quot; incident gave rise to a letter from the Colonial Office to the Board of Trade expressing the view that it was useless to make the carrying of wireless compulsory, as proposed by the inter-departmental conference, unless the operator&apos;s cabin and other easily accessible parts of the apparatus could be placed in some part of the ship which could be rendered defensible.On the 18th August, M. Cerruti spoke to Mr. Palairet about an idea contained in a report from his admiral at Shanghai that an international force be created to deal with piracy in South China and off the coast of Indo-China and Siam.On the 18th December, 1925, there was a quite new development. Steamship &quot;Tungchow&quot; (Butterfield and Swdre) w7as pirated between Shanghai and Tien-tsin, 200 miles south of Weihaiwei, by pirates disguised as passengers. The ship was taken to Bias Bay. Among the passengers were Mr. Gamble of His Majesty&apos;s Legation, and Mr. Woodhead, the editor of the &quot;Peking and Tien-tsin Times.&apos;&apos; There was also a confidential Foreign Office bag on board. This was the first case which had occurred in Northern Chinese waters, and Sir Sidney Barton urged immediate action against Bias Bay by British naval authorities and a search on shore under the supervision of consular officers to find the goods looted and the persons implicated. The Wai-chiao Pu were asked, on the 24th December, to telegraph to the officer commanding their fleet in southern waters to take immediate action, if necessary, with British co-operation. In reporting this, Sir Ronald Macleay recommended to the Foreign Office that, without waiting for the Peking Government or the co-operation of the local Chinese naval authorities, the Commander-in-chief, with the concurrence of the consul-general, Canton, should take suitable measures.On the 29th December the consul-general, Canton, asked the Canton Government to send a punitive expedition.On the 1st January, 1926, Sir Sidney Barton telegraphed that the Chinese
cruiser &quot; Tungchi &quot; had been instructed to round up the Bias Bay pirates and would arrive there on the 2nd January. Chiang Kai-shek had heen asked by the Chinese admiral to co-operate.The consul-general, Canton, however, deprecated this co-operation by Northern Chinese warships as likely to complicate certain local negotiations and to renew anti-British feeling. The local government should first be given an opportunity of showing what they could do unaided, and it was for them to say if they wanted assistance.On the 9th January Sir Sidney Barton said that the &quot; Tungchi &quot; was at Bias Bay, and that Admiral Li in Hong Kong had been instructed to get into touch with the British authorities.On the 12th January the Commander-in-chief reported the arrival at Hong Kong of Chinese warships which had visited Bias Bay without discovering any trace of the stolen property. It was thought that the pirates had scattered after landing and might be in Hong Kong or Macao.Meanwhile, on the 9th January, the Commissioner for Foreign Affairs at Canton replied to the consul-general that the Nationalist Government had instructed him to say that they themselves would be able to exterminate the pirates and had begun to move. There was no need of foreign assistance, no interference would be tolerated from anyone.The naval court of enquiry into this piracy recommended that greater care be exercised in supervising Chinese passengers. If possible, some record should be kept of those to whom tickets were sold, and they should be searched for arms before the ship left port. In cases of ships carrying bullion or specie it might be advisable either to take no Chinese passengers or to carry an armed guard. The court, however, recorded its conviction that the only satisfactory way of dealing with the pirate menace was to destroy the pirate bases on shore.In forwarding this report Sir Sidney Barton explained that Chinese accommo-dation on the ships concerned was leased to a compradore, who made his own arrangements about selling tickets. They were either sold to passengers on board after departure, or sold previously without record through shops and native hotels. The China Navigation Company thought that any attempt to institute a stricter system or any search for arms would drive the passenger traffic away from British ships.On the 9th March, 1926, the Commander-in-chief (Vice-Admiral Alexander-Sinclair) issued a circular instruction that, with a view to rendering Bias Bay too dangerous and effecting unexpected captures, His Majesty&apos;s ships should proceed there whenever opportunity offered on passage, and also periodically use it as an anchorage for the night, instead of Mirs Bay. Searchlight and star-shell exercises were occasionally to be carried out there.The French admiral gave similar instructions.On the 21st April the Colonial Office informed the new Governor of Hong Kong, Sir Cecil Clementi, that the Avhole question of piracy had been discussed between Sir Reginald Stubbs and representatives of the Admiralty, Foreign Office, War Office and Board of Trade. There was general concurrence in the report of the inter-departmental conference of 1924. The Admiralty were unable to accept the contention in the &quot;minority report &quot; that the navy should assume practically entire responsibility for the protection of commerce in Chinese waters. They observed that merchant vessels were expected to protect themselves to a large extent from sporadic attacks and to accept the inconveniences (e.g., convoy) of which Hong Kong traders complained. It was unreasonable that traders should expect to cany on their business without inconvenience or danger in a foreign country in time of civil war, and should have provided for them, without cost to themselves, whatever measure of protection was necessary to effect this. The Admiralty view was that, in the conditions obtaining in the Canton Delta, a ship must be prepared to defend itself. The Colonial Office pointed out that, while certain amendments in the piracy regulations Were desirable, no practicable alternative had been put forward for the general scheme of defence embodied in the regulations. The wireless question still awaited a Board of Trade decision, which could not be taken on the results of tests up to that time.On the 30th June the Governor, Hong Kong, pointed out that, since the &quot; Tungchow &quot; incident, three more piracies had been carried out by the Bias Bay gang. He proposed an expedition to Bias Bay when the next piracy was reported by two companies of a British regiment, who should land and prevent the pirates from
removing loot, if necessary destroying villages. If Chinese co-operation could be obtained so much the better, but the great thing was speed. The Canton Government would probably protest and say it was an act of war, but they would probably rejoice in secret and might even be encouraged to take up piracy suppression themselves. The result would be salutary and would enhance British prestige.On the 10th September the Canton Government sent a notification to the foreign consuls at Canton outlining a scheme for the protection of merchant ships against pirates by the Chinese authorities. The scheme was on the analogy of the arrano-e-ments made when foreigners visited the interior. When any foreign merchant vessel navigated inland waters it should report to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs (by inference through its consul) and request protection or request that a warship bij detailed to accompany it. The notification attributed previous incidents to failure to notify the Chinese authorities. The scheme was to be put into force experimentally in the section between the Bocca Tigris and Canton City. After three weeks it might be extended to the rest of the west and east rivers. In reporting this the consul-general, Canton, pointed out that it sounded well on paper, but its effect wTould be better were it not for the decrepit character of the &quot;warships&quot; to which reference was made. Most of them were little more than launches.  As a matter of fact, nothing further has been heard of this scheme.Commenting on the proposal of the Governor of Hong Kong that a military expedition be sent to Bias Bay, the consul-general, Canton, said that to be effective villages and native craft would have to be destroyed. This wTould lay us open to a charge of barbarous treatment of innocent villagers. He suggested as an alternative that British troops should occupy Bias Bay, giving the Chinese Government an undertaking to withdraw as soon as the garrison could be replaced by a permanent Chinese garrison. In any case, any action decided upon should come immediately after the piracy of a British ship by the Bias Bay gang, and the consul-general suggested that he be forthwith authorised to inform the Canton Government that the action decided upon would be taken after the next piracy unless they acted in the meantime.On the 14th October the Legation concurred generally in the consul-general&apos;s views.In a letter to the Governor of Hong Kong on the 14th October, concurred in by the General Officer Commanding, South China, the commodore, Hong Kong, said that punitive expeditions to isolated places on the coast would not stop the piracy of ocean-going steamers, which could only be prevented by (a.) Strict supervision of passengers on embarkation. (&amp;.) Protective measures inside the vessel.These were matters for the local police and harbour authorities. The naval authorities could do little more than they were doing short of occupying all pirate bases and providing escorts for all steamers, both of which were impracticable. After frequent visits by His Majesty&apos;s ships to Bias Bay the pirates thought it better to land booty at Kiau Island. There were many other places which could be similarly used. The organisation of pirates was good, and occasional garrisons, while incommoding them slightly, would not stop their vvork and would be inconvenient and expensive for us. For the same reasons a Chinese garrison at Bias Bay would be ineffective. If the local authorities and shipowners failed to take proper precautions at embarkation and on board they could hardly expect His Majesty&apos;s Government to do their job for them.The Commander-in-chief concurred in these views in a despatch to the Legation on the 27th October.While this correspondence had been going on several more piracies occurred, culminating in the &quot;Sunning&quot; incident on the 15th November. The steamship &quot;Sunning&quot; (British, Butterfield and Swire) was pirated between Shanghai and Hong Kong from within. She was fitted with grilles and wireless, but both proved useless. The officers, however, contrived to regain control of the ship, and after-setting fire to the ship the majority of the pirates went off with one passenger (Mr. Lapsley, a British subject of whom no more has been heard). His Majesty&apos;s ship &quot; Bluebell &quot; came up and arrested twelve pirates left on the ship and afterwards a boat containing ten pirates.The first report which reached Hong Kong erroneously stated that the pirates had made off with two European women. After conferring with the Commander-in-chief and officer commanding troops the Governor accordingly arranged that
H.M.S. &quot;Vindictive&quot; should go to Bias Bay with two platoons of infantry, certain Hong Kong police officials and a number of Chinese police interpreters and detectives with the idea of intercepting the pirates and releasing the captives.Having previously received orders from the &quot;War Office not to send troops into Chinese territory without specific instructions from His Majesty&apos;s Government, the officer commanding troops felt bound to informthe &quot;War Office by telegram and ask for the necessary authority. The Governor simultaneously telegraphed to the Colonial Office calling attention to a despatch dated the 23rd July, in which he had urged that full discretion as to the use of armed forces in dealing with Chinese pirates should be allowed to the Commander-in-chief, the officer commanding troops and himself.On the 17th November the &quot;War Office telegraphed that the platoons might act under the orders of the admiral, to whom instructions were being sent.The instructions to the admiral, however, were to the effect that on general grounds His Majesty&apos;s Government considered it undesirable that we should become engaged in operations which, though directed against pirates, would cause us to become more deeply involved with the Chinese. No landing was to be carried out, therefore, unless (1.) The women were British.(2.) All means of rescue by negotiation, including ransom, had been exhausted. (3.) Rescue could be effected without involving the forces in dangerous or extensive operations.The Admiralty pointed out that the prisoners might be removed or murdered if parties were landed.In view of these instructions the Commander-in-chief countermanded his instructions to the &quot;Vindictive.&quot;In a despatch on the 21st November the Governor emphatically disagreed with the idea that British authorities should negotiate the release of prisoners or offer a ransom. This would make piracy still more lucrative and attractive. He again urged that he and the Commander-in-chief and the general be given discretion to undertake operations against pirates. He was fully alive to the unwisdom of committing His Majesty&apos;s forces to dangerous and extended operations, but those on the spot were best able to weigh the risk of any operation against the results expected from it.At the request of the Governor the &quot;Sunning&quot; piracy was brought to the notice of the Canton Government, who were told that Hong Kong would co-operate at any time.On the 20th November the Colonial Office telegraphed to the Governor of Hong Kong saying that while sympathising with his attitude His Majesty&apos;s Government must insist that, having regard to the difficulties and delicacy of the Chinese situation, the British troops should on no account be employed outside the frontiers of the Colony without specific instructions from His Majesty&apos;s Government.The Governor, in reply, explained how impracticable it was to consult London in an emergency and await a reply.At a meeting of the Hong Kong Defence Committee, attended by the Commander-in-chief on the 23rd November, it was unanimously agreed that in case of piracy effective action was not possible unless full discretion as to the use of armed forces was allowed to the Governor, the Commander-in-chief and the officer commanding troops in co-operation.On the 2nd December the consul-general, Canton, followed up the offer of co-operation in the &quot;Sunning&quot; case with a verbal warning that, if they rejected the offer of assistance and would do nothing themselves, the British authorities might be forced to act independently as the constant threat to shipping was becoming insupportable. The answer was&apos; that British action would be resented as an infringement of China&apos;s sovereign rights. To this Mr. Brenan replied that, if the Canton Government attempted to make, propaganda out of the matter, we should publish the facts showing that we had first.urged the Chinese authorities to take action themselves, and then offered them every facility for a joint operation. If in spite of this they allowed the Bias Bay piracy base to continue, they would be publicly condemned as a dangerously incompetent administration.On the 3rd December Mr. Brenan received a private letter from Mr. Wai Yuk, secretary in charge of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, saying that General Tan Yen-kai,  after consultation with General Li  Chai-sum,  was not  opposed  to
co-operation, the best form of which would be a joint committee to decide on a plan of action.The day before this letter was received the Canton Government officially protested against the appearance in the Bias Bay district of British warships and aeroplanes as an infringement of China&apos;s sovereign rights. Mr. Brenan replied by quoting article 52 of the Treaty of Tien-tsin as giving British ships a perfect right to go to Bias Bay. He once more urged the Canton Government to accept British help in suppressing the pirates. If the Nationalist Government objected to the visits of British warships, were they willing to accept responsibility for the losses of British shipping companies owing to pirates which they themselves made no attempt to suppress ?.The Canton Government, in reply, said they would welcome the co-operation of the Hong Kong authorities in intercepting bandits as they crossed the border. They asked for a visit of a Hong Kong delegate to discuss measures.A meeting took place in Canton on the 14th December between the captain-superintendent of police, Hong Kong, and Chinese military representatives. The Chinese stated that joint action was not acceptable. They themselves were taking action. Two thousand troops were engaged in a drive west of Bias Bay, Chinese gunboats being present to prevent escape by sea. British co-operation was required only to &quot;the extent of preventing the escape of pirates into Hong Kong territory. It was pointed out, on the British side, that there were no pirate bases on the west of Bias Bay. The Chinese military representative said that pirate villages to the north and east would also be dealt with.On the 23rd December the Foreign Office issued instructions about piracy. His Majesty&apos;s consul-general, Canton, was immediately7 to represent to the Canton Government the situation of foreign shipping in the south China seas owing to the increasing and unchecked activity of pirates. He was to invite them to co-operate with the British naval and military authorities in taking effective measures to put an end to these activities, and to give clear warning that, in the event of their refusing their co-operation even to the extent of deputing a representative to be present at the scene of action, His Majesty&apos;s Government would be compelled to take independent action strictly limited to the object in view immediately after the next piracy outrage directed against British ships or endangering British lives.At the same time the Foreign Office said that instructions were about to be issued to British naval and military authorities on the spot to carry out a landing operation as close as possible to Fan Ho Kong village, the details of which were to be communicated to His Majesty&apos;s Government. The operation was to take place immediately after the next piracy and would involve landing before dawn, followed by entry into the village half-an-hour after dawn, and the destruction of the houses of known pirates after ensuring that the civil population had evacuated them. If any pirates w7ere captured they should, if possible, be handed over to the local Chinese authorities. Should landing be opposed, covering fire would be provided by ships&apos; guns and machine guns. No smoke bombs were to be used. The operation was to be completed within twenty-four hours and no further offensive action w7as intended unless British troops were attacked.These instructions were, however, suspended in view7 of news of the Chinese expedition against Bias Bay.Subsequent information made it fairly clear that the Chinese expedition to Bias Bay was really7 directed against General Lo Kwan, a political opponent of Canton, whose followers on the 6th December had attacked some Canton military cadets. It was fairly clear that Canton were throwing dust in our eyes by repre-senting this as an attempt to suppress piracy. It explained also why the west of Bias Bay and not the north and east was being attacked.Consequently on the 16th December the Governor again urged His Majesty&apos;s Government to consider independent action. He had privately suggested to the French consul at Hong Kong that the French navy should co-operate. This was communicated to Peking and the French Minister was understood to have referred it to Paris for favourable consideration.On the 31st December the Governor in a despatch to the Colonial Office said that the proof of the efficacy of the Canton expedition would be whether any further piracy took place. If a further attack occurred he proposed immediately to carry out a landing operation on the lines already laid down, with the co-operation of the Commander-in-chief and the officer commanding troops.On the 4th January, 1927, the consul-general, Canton, said that though General
Lo Kwan was being attacked as a political opponent, his troops were scarcely distinguishable from pirates. His family lived in Hong Kong and he visited the Colony frequently. Mr. Brenan suggested that he and other persons actively opposed to Canton should be expelled from Hong Kong.On the 11th January Mr. Brenan asked for authority to state officially that on the next piracy of a British ship independent action would be taken. He suggested that his note to this effect should be published and accompanied by a publicity campaign in the home papers and Rugby wireless, regarding the failure of the Canton authorities to deal with the menace.In a telegram of the 12th January to Hong Kong, His Majesty&apos;s Minister sounded a warning about the threat of independent action, if Bias Bay was in fact under the actual control of one of the political enemies of Canton who had connection with Hong Kong. He recalled that he had mentioned anti-piracy to Eugene Chen at Hankow and that Mr. Chen had retorted that piracies were organised from headquarters stationed in Hong Kong. The Minister had not under-stood the reference and thought Mr. Chen might have Lo Kwan in mind.On the 27th January the British steamship &apos;&apos; Seangbee &apos;&apos; was pirated from within between Singapore and Hong Kong and taken to Bias Bay.The Governor telegraphed to the Colonial Office on the 31st January that the action of the Canton authorities had clearly been ineffective. He strongly recommended independent action by His Majesty&apos;s Government and a publicity campaign as suggested by Mr. Brenan.On the 1st February the Minister telegraphed to the Foreign Office that, while keen to deal with the pirate menace, he thought action at that moment might jeopardise Mr. 0&apos;Malley&apos;s negotiations at Hankow.This crossed a telegram from the Foreign Office (no doubt influenced by the fact that the Shanghai Defence Force was just being sent out), which said that any forcible action such as landing troops and destroying villages (a.) Might produce disastrous effects on world opinion and reawaken the suspicion that our defensive measures covered aggressive designs. (&amp;.) Might prejudice Mr. 0&apos;Malley&apos;s negotiations.No action was to be taken without consultation with Mr. 0&apos;Malley and the Minister and the latter&apos;s express approval. The Foreign Office suggested protests by the consul-general, Canton, and by Mr. 0&apos;Malley to Mr. Chen. &quot;We have right to expect that Nationalist Government which claim to exercise sole authority in South should discharge elementary duties of civilised Government and put an end to these continuous outrages on the law of nations.&apos;&apos;Mr. Brenan made a protest as instructed, but he pointed out that, in view of His Majesty&apos;s Governments instructions of the 23rd December, he had already threatened independent action if another piracy occurred. Another piracy had now occurred and nothing had been done. This weakened any representations he might make. He urged that if an attack on Bias Bay could not be made, a permanent guard-ship might be kept there.In an interview with Mr. Brenan on the 9th February, General Li Chai Sum, after repeating the argument that pirates were taking refuge in Hong Kong, promised that an expedition should be sent within a week to the villages on the north and east of Bias Bay. Mr. Brenan reported that he had little faith in this promise, and thought that the failure of Canton to take effective action against pirates was deliberate and a part of their general policy of annoying and attacking the British.On the 1st March His Majesty&apos;s Minister instructed Mr. 0&apos;Malley to discuss Bias Bay with Mr. Chen and ask if he had any proposals. He was to point out that, after the assurances of Canton in December that the pirates would be exterminated without British co-operation, three more piracies had taken place. If no more effective action was contemplated by Canton His Majesty&apos;s Government would have no option but to act independently.On the following day the Minister recommended to the Foreign Office that, in order to prepare the public for any action that might be taken, a publicity campaign as recommended by Mr. Brenan should be started.On the same day the Minister wired to the Governor of Hong Kong saying that he felt that by allowing Chen Chiung Ming to remain in Hong Kong we were giving the Nationalists a handle.On the 4th March the consul-general, Canton, reported that the Ministry for Foreign Affairs had informed him that their naval forces had already attacked the [18746] e
Bias Bay pirates and that instructions had been given for further operations against the villages on the north and the east of the bay.On the 8th and 18th March the Canton authorities requested that, in order to assist Chinese operations against Bias Bay, the Hong Kong Government might be asked to send troops to the frontier to prevent pirates entering British territory.On the 19th March Mr. Eugene Chen handed to Mr. Teichman an aide-memoire in reply to the latter&apos;s representations. This aide-memoire said that the British proposal for the suppression of pirates was not wise since it was neither necessary nor civilised to burn and destroy Chinese villages with consequent loss of Chinese lives. The Nationalist Government thought a more effective method would be to station a British gunboat at the entrance to Bias Bay, the Nationalist Government having no naval craft suitable for such service.On the 21st March the British steamship &quot; Hopsang &quot; was pirated between Swatow and Hong Kong and taken to Bias Bay.On the 22nd March the Government of Hong Kong urged that a punitive expedi-tion to Bias Bay be authorised immediately. The Minister wired to Shanghai on the 23rd March that, while he was rather in favour of direct action, the question must depend on the position at Shanghai. He accordingly asked for observations. This telegram crossed a telegram from the Colonial Office of the 22nd March instructing the Governor not to act without the concurrence of the Minister. The situation at Shanghai must be the first consideration, and the Minister must decide regarding the reaction on that situation of a landing elsewhere.This in its turn crossed a telegram from the Governor to the Minister of the 23rd March saying that punitive operations by the navy had begun on Bias Bay at dawn that day. The operation was carried out by naval forces only (with police officers attached).   Landing-parties burnt houses.On the 26th March the Ministry for Foreign Affairs in Canton protested to the consul-general against the Bias Bay expedition, criticised the landing of British troops as a contravention of Chinese territorial rights, and demanded an apology from the Hong Kong Government together with a guarantee that there would be no repetition. The consul-general replied by reference to the innumerable letters which he had addressed to the Canton Government and the interviews which he had had with their representatives concerning piracy, and said he hoped the Canton Govern-ment would prevent the necessity for a repetition of the British action by themselves taking steps to repress the Bias Bay pirates.On the 5th April Mr. Eugene Chen protested formally to Mr. Teichman against the expedition to Bias Bay on account of the destruction of Chinese villages.On the 27th April, in reply to an enquiry from the Foreign Office, the Admiralty observed that Mr. Brenan&apos;s suggestion that a British warship might be stationed in Bias Bay was contingent on a landing expedition being authorised. Since his suggestion was made punitive action had been taken by British forces and up to that time no further piracies had taken place. The Admiralty recommended that no action be taken until there was evidence that the recent raid had not proved a sufficient deterrent.On the 6th May the Governor forwarded a report of the Commission of Enquiry into the &quot; Sunning &quot; piracy (the 15th November, 1926). The commission was of opinion that effective search would entail so large a staff or so much delay as to make it impossible. They noted that the piracy regulations had been disregarded and there was no scheme of defence on board the &quot; Sunning.&quot; There was no enthusiasm among shipowners or masters for guards, and the commission recommended that the engage-ment of guards should be left entirely to the owners, but that the guards should continue to be trained by the Hong Kong police and constitute a force on which owners could draw. They thought that while patrols by the navy over the whole danger zone were impossible, patrols might be increased.The following is an extract from the conclusions of the commission : &quot; The main conclusion to which the commission has been driven is that the conditions demand precautions and an organisation to resist pirates on board every vessel exposed to the risk of piracy; but that no system is worth the cost of installation or the trouble of organising unless it is backed by determination to resist on the part of the owners and officers alike, who must necessarily co-operate to this end. The Government hand in the organisation on board is openly unpopular, and in lacking the essential co-operation of owners and officers even constitutes an obstacle to the institution and development of voluntary schemes.  The piracy prevention regulations and thirteen years&apos; experience have
given a valuable lead, and the commission is unanimously of opinion that the responsibility for internal precautions and organisations should now be thrown back upon the owners, who, by seeking the co-operation of their officers and considering their views, will at least be able to ensure that confidence in the arrangements which is essential.&quot;The unanimous recommendations of the commissioners were as follows : &quot; (1.) The Government should endeavour to induce the authorities at the coast ports to make the searching at those ports more effective, and should continue to press for the co-operation of the Chinese authorities to deal with the evil ashore. Should effective co-operation continue to be withheld, the commissioners consider that His Majesty&apos;s Government would be amply justified in taking independent action for the extermination of known pirate strongholds as a common international duty.&quot; (2.) The necessity for all possible patrolling by the navy on the rivers and on the coast, especially in the vicinity of such spots as Bias Bay, should continue to be emphasised.&quot; (3.) The wdiole of the piracy prevention regulations should be rescinded, and the following recommendations should be brought to the notice of owners as the outlines of a scheme sufficient to enable a few determined men to prevent a successful piracy, and so make even the attempts at piracy unlikely : &quot; (a.) The bridge should be protected by grilles and dodgers, with guards stationed at the entrances.&quot; (b.) Subsidiary grilles should be provided, isolating the officers and first-class cabins as far as possible.(c.) Careful attention should be given to points of detail, such as the arrangement of lights to assist the defence, a system of alarm bells and a plan to concentrate all Europeans on alarm.&quot; (4.) The compulsory installation of wireless telegraph should be considered, but, in any event, the Government should encourage its use and development by such means as the reduction of charges for assisting of anti-piracy messages.&quot; (5.) The Government should establish a board to be the repository of all data connected with piracy, which should meet at, say, quarterly intervals to consider the question generally, with a view to being in a position to supply information and advice when called upon. . . .&quot;On the 6th May the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, Canton, informed the consul-general that most of the Bias Bay pirates had entered the Chi Kung Tang at Hong-Kong and other places where they had established organisations. They asked that the Governor would issue orders for the organisations to be dispersed and important criminals captured and sent to China for trial. They sent a list of branches, secret signs, membership cards, regulations and circulars of the Chi Kung Tang.This was followed by a more detailed note on the 28th May, saying that the Bias Bay piracies were the work of organisations in Hong Kong, Singapore and Shanghai, which formed an intelligence service and directed operations. The mere destruction of places where pirates lived or loot was landed could have no effect; the only way was to destroy the organisations at their source. A list containing the names of localities of pirate organisations in Hong Kong and Singapore, with the names and nicknames of pirates, was sent with the note. This information was passed on by the consul-general to Hong Kong and Singapore on the 1st June.Meanwhile, on the 11th May, the Governor of Hong Kong asked the consul-general to bring to the notice of the Canton Government the piracy on the 6th May of the Chinese steamship &quot; Feng Fu,&quot; and to request them to take the necessary punitive measures and offer British naval co-operation. If co-operation was again rejected and the Chinese authorities did not suppress Bias Bay piracy, independent punitive action would be taken by the British navy in the event of any British ship being pirated from Bias Bay.A communication in this sense was made to the Canton Government on the 12th May, and the consul-general, in reporting to the Governor, suggested that if punitive action became necessary it should be confined to the destruction of native craft in the bay. The last expedition had been accomplished without casualties, but there was no certainty that this success would be repeated. Mr. Brenan agreed [18746] e 2
that action should be continued until Bias Bay was abandoned as a pirate base, ^ but he did not contemplate without misgiving a series of armed raids on Chinese&quot; territory. Apart from political objections to such action, British forces must sooner or later meet with resistance which would lead to warlike measures on a larger scale than desired by His Majesty&apos;s Government. As a deterrent the destruction of junks must be almost as efficacious as the demolition of huts.On the 2nd July the Canton Government followed up their protest of the 26th March against the expedition to Bias Bay by a further note, in which they said that the demand of foreigners to co-operate in the suppression of brigands within a country was one which no independent nation could accept. Foreigners could not avail themselves of this pretext to violate the sovereign rights of a friendly country. They characterised the British action as &apos;&apos; improper and brutal,&apos;&apos; talked about arson and the slaughter of innocent persons, and said these methods not only violated the usages of international law but were contrary to the principles of human conduct. Accompanying the note was a list of damages. The note demanded compensation, apology and a guarantee against repetition.A further note on the same lines on the same day repeated that the reason lor the pirates&apos; existence was not Bias Bay but the fact that thej^ were allowed to use Hong Kong and Singapore as bases.Further claims were submitted on the 12th July.On the 22nd July the Norwegian vessel &quot; Solviken &quot; was pirated and taken to Bias Bay. The Commander-in-chief asked the Minister whether punitive action should be taken, adding that he had ordered it to be taken by the navy subject to the Governors approval. The Minister replied that in his own view action should be taken, but in view of the fact that the ship was not British and of questions raised in Parliament over the last expedition, the consent of His Majesty&apos;s Government should first be obtained. In view of this the Commander-in-chief told the Governor that he did not recommend further action.On the 21st July the Governor asked the consul-general, Canton, to enquire if the Canton Government were now prepared to accept the co-operation of the Hong Kong Government against Bias Bayr. In the event of a negative reply the Governor washed a warning to be given that independent British punitive action would, without fail, be taken if the Bias Bay gang committed any further outrage on a British ship.The consul-general made the enquiry as requested on the 25th July, but explained to the Governor that, in view of instructions which he had received in June regarding retaliatory action, he could not make any further threat of such action without the authorisation of His Majesty&apos;s Minister and the Commander-in-chief.On the 25th July the Governor telegraphed that he agreed that action should AOt be taken in the case of the &quot; Solviken.&quot; He was much concerned, however, to learn from the commodore that after the 1st August he would no longer have sufficient naval force at his disposal to carry out a punitive expedition in Bias Bay, as planned by Admiral Boyle, and he strongly urged that the naval force at Hong Kong should not be depleted below the strength requisite for this purpose.On the 30th July Sir Sidney Barton reported that the Norwegian consul-general, /nder instructions from his Government, had brought before the consular body the question of joint action by the Powers interested in shipping to deal with Bias Bay pirates. The consular body unanimously agreed that joint action was most desirable, but pointed out that it Gould only be arranged by the naval Commanders-in-chief through the Ministers in Peking. On the 12th August the Legation reported that me question had been raised at a Diplomatic Bod)^ meeting by the Norwegian Minister, but while the principle of joint action was generally supported no one was prepared to undertake to make any naval or military assistance for the purpose available.On the 8th August His Majesty&apos;s consul at Amoy forwarded correspondence with the Hong Kong Government to the Legation, and asked for instructions as to the action he should take on a request by the Governor that he should secure a more rigorous search of Chinese passengers embarking at Amoy. The consul pointed out that the Customs had not the necessary staff, and for political reasons it would be undesirable to permit the local authorities to assume the duty of search. The Chinese, authorities would no doubt be only too pleased to co-operate, but past experience had shown that any such arrangement would merely serve as-a pretext for extortion while being of little value from the point of view of piracy prevention.
On the 12th August the Commander-in-chief informed His Majesty&apos;s Minister that his own instructions regarding retaliatory action did not refer to piracy. In the event of any piracy against a British ship the Governor of Hong Kong was at liberty to call upon such naval forces as might be available at Hong Kong in order to deal with the pirates quickly and effectively without previously referring to him.On the 31st August His Majesty&apos;s Minister instructed consul-general, Canton, that his own instructions regarding retaliatory action, like those of the Commander-in-chief, did not refer to piracy. Mr. Brenan was at liberty to give the warning to the Canton authorities at his discretion.On the same day the Minister informed the Governor of Hong Kong that he did not wish to delay action in the event of another British ship being pirated. Nevertheless, action might have a political repercussion if it involved a descent upon Chinese territory. His Majesty&apos;s Minister, therefore, asked that where time permitted the Governor would notify him of any proposed action and obtain his concurrence before taking it.On the 18th August His Majesty&apos;s consul-general, Canton, transmitted to the Canton Government a preliminary report on the police enquiries which had taken place in Hong Kong on the information supplied by Canton. A more detailed report would follow, but the meagre nature of the information supplied was making the investigation a matter of great difficulty.On the 30th August the Minister informed His Majesty&apos;s consul at Amoy that except in exceptional circumstances he was reluctant to allow any departure from the principle that the only Chinese authority vested by treaty with the right to search British vessels was the Maritime Customs. Chinese control at Amoy and other ports would scarcely prove effective as a means of piracy prevention, and would be liable to be abused.On the 24th August the Chinese vessel &quot; Hsinchi &quot; was pirated between Shanghai and Fuchow, and taken to Bias Bay.The same fate befell the British steamer &quot; Yatshing &quot; between Swatow and Shanghai on the 30th August, and accordingly at dawn on the 1st September a naval punitive expedition left for Bias Bay, and a landing party of 500 men destroyed nouses in two villages and junks in the harbour.On the 1st September the Chinese-owned steamer &quot; Kochow,&quot; flying the British flag, was pirated on the West River, the chief engineer, a British subject, being killed. With the concurrence of His Majesty&apos;s Minister a landing party from British gunboats burnt several houses and junks at the pirate village of Taipinghu on the 3rd September. Another village, Shekki, also implicated in the same piracy, was shelled after the inhabitants had been warned to evacuate.APPENDIX III.Recommendations and Conclusions of the Sunning Piracy Commission.THE main conclusion to which the Commission has been driven is that the conditions demand precautions and an organisation to resist pirates on board every vessel exposed to the risk of piracy; but that no system is worth the cost of installation or the trouble of organising unless it is backed by a determination to resist on the part of owners and officers alike, who must necessarily, co-operate to this end. The Government hand in the organisation on board is openly unpopular, and, in lacking the essential co-operation of owners and officers, even constitutes an obstacle to the institution and development of voluntary schemes. The Piracy Prevention Regulations and thirteen years&apos; experience have given a valuable lead; and the Commission is unanimously of opinion that the responsibility for internal precautions and organisation should now be thrown back upon the owners, who, by seeking the co-operation of their officers and considering their views, will at least be able to ensure that confidence in the arrangements which is essential.   Where
so the proper spirit exists, the Commissioners are convinced that arrangements can be made which will go far towards eliminating the risk of piracy, while if that spirit is lacking Government regulations will avail but little. This conclusion is no royal road to the elimination of piracy, but the Commissioners are satisfied that it goes to the heart of the matter, and that it must form the foundation of any attempt of whatever kind to mitigate the evils of piratical attacks.It is by no means intended, however, that the Government should do nothing. It is the Governments part to press for all possible patrolling, and independent action if called for, by the Navy on the river and around spots such as Bias Bay, to encourage the installation of wireless, to consider the desirability of making it compulsory, and to facilitate its employment by such methods as the reduction to a minimum of transmission charges, to continue to make the Colony an unhealthy centre for pirates by search and detective operations afloat and ashore, and, in addition, to afford all such advice and assistance towards the making of satisfactory arrangements on board as it may be possible to provide. In a purely voluntary scheme such as the Commission favours, the provision of satisfactory guards, for example, may offer difficulties to private companies. In this matter Government could undoubtedly assist, and, under Section VI above, the Commissioners have outlined a scheme which they anticipate would secure the necessary co-operation with the owners. There may be many details in which advice would be sought (the details of a system of signals is an obvious one), and the resources of the Harbour Office, and of others as may be necessary, should be made available. In their recommendations the Commissioners include, in a general shape applicable to all vessels alike, points which the enquiry has shown to be most deserving of the consideration of owners in forming their own defence schemes. But opinions may be desired. on the many possible modifications, and these should be readily available.The unanimous recommendations of the Commissioners are summarised as follows : 1. The Government should endeavour to induce the authorities at the coast ports to make the searching at those ports more effective, and should continue to press for the co-operation of the Chinese authorities to deal with the evil ashore. Should effective co-operation continue to be withheld, the Commissioners consider that His Majesty&apos;s Government would be amply justified in taking independent action for the extermination of knoAvn pirate strongholds as a common international duty.2. The necessity for all possible patrolling by the Navy on the rivers and on the coast, especially in the vicinity of such spots as Bias Bay, should continue to be emphasised.3. The whole of the Piracy Prevention Regulations should be rescinded, and the following recommendations should be brought to the notice of owners as the outlines of a scheme sufficient to enable a few determined men to prevent a successful piracy, and so to make even the attempt at piracy unlikely: (a.) The bridge should be protected by grilles and dodgers, with guardsstationed at the entrances. (&amp;.) Subsidiary grilles should be provided, isolating the officers and first-classcabins as far as possible. (c.) Careful attention should be given to points of detail such as: the arrange-ment of lights to assist the defence, a system of alarm bells and a plan to concentrate all Europeans on alarm.4. The compulsory installation of wireless telegraphy should be considered, but in any event the Government should encourage its use and development by such means as the reduction of charges for a system of anti-piracy messages.5. The Government should establish a Board to be the repository of all data connected with piracy, which should meet at, say, quarterly intervals to consider the question generally with a view to being in a position to supply information and advice when called upon. The idea of the Commissioners is to reduce formalities, and therefore delay, to a minimum. The opinion and advice of the members of the Board should be severally or jointly at the disposal of those concerned, and the available data should be equally at the disposal of each member, who would have discretion to advise with or without calling the remaining members to formal consultation. The responsibility for the collection and custody of the records would naturally fall to the lot of the Harbour Master, with the Harbour Office as the most
convenient repository; and the members to be associated with him should include the Captain Superintendent of Police, a Naval Officer, and a Coast Officer still serving. The necessary steps should from time to time be taken to bring the existence and nature of this Board, and its personnel to the notice of those concerned, especially the shipping companies.
&quot;336This Document is the Property of Hia Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Committee of Imperial Defence.   March 1929.SECRET.Copy No.2 5COMMITTEE  OF  IMPERIAL DEFENCE.Extract from the DRAFT Minutes of the 24:0th Meeting, held on March 8, 1929.(Previous reference : C.I.D. Minutes of the 219th Meeting, Minute 2.)THE COMMITTEE had under consideration a report by the Chiefs of Staff (C.I.D. Paper No. 330-C) on the subject of piracy in China waters.THE PRIME MINISTER, after welcoming Mr. Louw, the new High Com-missioner for the Union of South Africa, asked the First Sea Lord if he had anything to add to the Report.SIR CHARLES MADDEN said he had been asked by the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee to represent their views. The Chiefs of Staff hoped that the Committee of Imperial Defence would take no decisions in regard to matters of detail, but would arrive at conclusions on the questions of policy involved. A Committee had been set up at Hong Kong for the purpose of dealing with piracy and required a lead, firstly, with regard to the policy to be adopted towards rhe shipowners, and, secondly, the policy vis-a-vis the Chinese Government. He stressed the fact that every Commission and Committee that has sat in China on the subject of piracy had recommended that responsibility for the protection of ships and passengers should rest with the Police and shipowners, and that it should not be regarded as the duty of the military or naval authorities to provide the necessary protection. The shipowners, on the other hand, had always adopted the opposite view. As late as the 16th November, 1928, the Naval Commander-in-Chief, China, had telegraphed that, in his opinion, most of the shipping companies would prefer their ships to be pirated, their passengers robbed and their baggage looted, and that the ship, their foreign passengers and themselves should be left unharmed, rather than that officers, by putting up a defence, should run the risk of the ship being damaged by fire, with consequent serious danger to foreign passengers and themselves and heavy loss to the owners. Although none of the Committees he had referred to had stated the case quite so strongly, they all appeared to be unanimous that, so long as naval or military protection was given, the Companies would do nothing. The Commander-in-Chief, China, had telegraphed on the 19th February that it was essential that an authoritative ruling should be given as to whether responsibility for internal defence against pirates was a naval or shipowners&apos; responsibility. He reported that some owners considered the responsibility wras a naval one and did nothing, whilst others organised their ships for defence and hired local Sikh guards, of whom about 400 were employed at Hong Kong. The Commander-in-Chief strongly urged that the responsibility for protecting ships should be handed back to the owners, who should be made to prepare for the time when regular naval or military guards would be withdrawn. He suggested that, afterwards, regular guards should only be provided in exceptional cases, and that such assistance, when given, should be paid for by the owners.The principal point, therefore, to be decided by the Committee was wmether we should go on providing guards, or whether the shipowners should be informed that after a certain lapse of time they must assume responsibility for their own protection. At the present time all guards of up-river steamers were provided by the Navy, and those of other shipping by the military authorities.(1.)-PIRACY IN CHINA WATERS.(C.I.D. Paper No. 330-C.)[18965-1]
Referring to recommendation (a) (iii) in the (Chiefs of Staff Report, he said that local guards were available at Hong Kong, where they were provided from the Sikh police and trained by British Officers. Some firms employed these native guards and appeared satisfied with them, while others considered them useless. The Chiefs of Staff recommended that regular naval and military guards should be continued for the present and that the efficiency and discipline of the native guards should be improved as far as possible, in order that they could take over all protective duties as soon as regular guards were dispensed with.SIR RONALD LINDSAY said that the only misgiving that the Foreign Office had was in connection with the existence of the Anti-Piracy Committee at Hong Kong. He now understood, however, that this Committee was definitely a subordinate one, and that it was waiting for rulings on matters of policy from home.SIR CHARLES MADDEN agreed that this was the case, and that the local Committee could not function without guidance from home.SIR PHILIP CUNLIFFE-LISTER, referring to paragraph 24 of the Chiefs of Staff Report, which indicated that protective fittings to the bridges, &amp;c, of the ships might contravene existing Board of Trade regulations, said that in the first place there were no Board of Trade surveyors in China to enforce the regulations. He had ascertained also, that in the case of a ship sailing from home to take part in this trade, the Board of Trade surveyors would not regard these arrangements as a breach of their regulations. Consequently, no trouble need be anticipated in this respect. The second question which arose was a matter of general policy. It seemed certain that many of the shipping companies would protest if protection were with-drawn, and would maintain that it was for the Government to safeguard ships against piracy on lawful occasions. On the other hand, if it was agreed to afford complete protection, it was difficult to see where this protection would stop. He suggested that the only way of answering the shipowners was to point out that the question of protecting shipping was not so very different from the protection of trade anywhere in China, and that, if we undertook to guard ships internally and externally, we might also be expected to provide goods with protection throughout their transit in China. To this they might answer that suppression of piracy on the high seas had always been regarded as a naval matter.SIR CHARLES MADDEN pointed out that the piracies under discussion were internal and not external piracies. There was no question of a pirate ship arriving and attacking the merchant ship. The pirates invariably embarked either as passengers or crew. He had recently seen the Captain of the S.S. &quot; Anking,&quot; who was wounded last year. The Captain had said that he left Singapore with about 1,400 Chinese on board. There seemed little doubt that the pirates among them had come purposely all the way from Bias Bay with the intention of carrying out the piracy. The Captain and Chief Officer had been looking over the bridge rail when Chinese with bare feet approached from behind, killing the Chief Officer and wounding the Captain in four or five places. The Chief Engineer was also subsequently killed. No patrolling by naval ships could possibly prevent an outrage of this nature.SIR PHILIP CUNLIFFE-LISTER enquired what the cost to the shipping companies would be if they provided protection themselves. He felt that it was inevitable that the shipping companies would complain that now, because the method of piracy had become more dangerous and insidious, protection was withdrawn.Mr. AMERY asked Avhether internal discipline on board ship was not a matter for the captain.SIR CHARLES MADDEN agreed that this was the case, but pointed out that, although arms were supplied to the ships&apos; officers, they were often disinclined to use them, and as stated in the telegram from the Commander-in-Chief, China, which he had previously quoted, some shipping companies seemed to prefer to have their ships pirated rather than to run the risk of damage and loss to foreign passengers and themselves.SIR SAMUEL HOARE asked if a large number of different companies was involved. &apos;        1   &apos; &apos; &quot;:      : -;-     &apos;       &apos; &apos;: .-  - -SIR CHARLES MADDEN replied, that there were many companies, including about six important ones.
&apos; SIR- RONALD LINDSAY- asked j what steps the Japanese took to j deal, withpiracy?&quot;3 &apos; 1   f       *r&quot;i&quot; i*c&apos;,i&quot; tci .JJ ^,vt!  ,  JJ V^n.     , ^u-   o    ,/SIR CHARLES MADDEN replied that piracies on Japanese shipping usually/ took place to the North of Shanghai.  The piracies were less frequent in the&apos; case of-Japanese ships, mainly owing to the fact that the complement of Japanese nationals on board was larger. ..  .SIR SAMUEL HO ARE suggested that in any case it would be necessary to give notice to the companies of the withdrawal of protection.SIR CHARLES MADDEN said that the Chiefs of Staff had recommended a year&apos;s notice. As regards the cost to the companies it would be difficult to give an estimate, although the cost of hiring Sikh guards could be ascertained, as these were now employed by several companies.SIR PHILIP CUNLIFFE-LISTER suggested that the fact that some companies already provided themselves with protection in this way was a strong argument for use against the remaining companies.SIR GEORGE MILNE remarked that a point to be borne in mind was the approaching reduction of troops in China, which wrould mean that military guards could no longer be supplied. At present the change of air obtained during trips as escort on board ship was regarded as beneficial for the health of the troops.SIR PHILIP CUNLIFFE-LISTER said that if some companies were actually now providing their own protection, it appeared worth while to try and force all the companies to do so.THE PRIME MINISTER suggested that the Committee should adopt the recommendations of the Chiefs of Staff in principle, and that the Anti-Piracy Committee in Hong Kong should be instructed to w-ork out the details of the action to be taken.SIR CHARLES MADDEN said there was another point for consideration, namely, whether pressure could be brought to bear on the Chinese Government. As pointed out in the Chiefs of Staff Report, and in all other previous reports on this subject, the only way in which piracy could be finally stamped out w^as by action on shore. The last attempt at international action had failed owing to the refusal of the United States to co-operate, and finally we had been left alone with the Japanese. The Chiefs of Staff considered that if in each case of piracy a strong protest was lodged with the Chinese Government and a demand was made for an indemnity, something might be done. At present the Governors of provinces did nothing, probably owing to the &apos;-&apos; squeeze &apos;&apos; they obtained from the pirates.SIR RONALD LINDSAY said that the Foreign Office were quite prepared in principle to make representations to the Chinese Government at Nanking, either on the general question of piracy or in connection with each specific case. One difficulty was, however, that sometimes pirates embarked at British ports and then committed acts of piracy on the high seas. In such circumstances it was very difficult to make a legal case. Although walling to make representations, the Foreign Office were not very sanguine as to the success they would meet wdth. Piracy, like many other things in China, wTas largely clue to general decajr. When, owing to the lawless state of the country, an otherwise peaceful-minded Chinaman found it impossible to carry out his usual vocation of agriculture he turned to piracy. He had been told that already, owing to more settled conditions in the South of China, piracies were becoming slightly less frequent.SIR CHARLES MADDEN said that everything depended on the amount of pressure which could be brought to bear on the Chinese Government. It was certain that local authorities knew the delinquents, and previous experience showed that even if local action did not stop piracy it acted as a deterrent.
 ..........................      Conclusion............The Committee of Imperial Defence agreed (a.) To recommend to the Cabinet that approval in principle should be given to the recommendations submitted by the Chiefs of Staff in paragraph 38 of their Report (C.I.D. Paper No. 330-C); and(&amp;.) To recommend that the Admiralty should be authorised to instruct the Naval Commander-in-Chief, China, that the Anti-Piracy Committee at Hong Kong should proceed on the assumption that the policy recommended by the Chiefs of Staff will be adopted in principle, and should submit in due course detailed proposals for giving effect to this policy(c.) To take note that the Foreign Office were prepared in principle to make representations to the Chinese Government at Nanking, either on the general question of piracy or in connection with each specific case, though they were not optimistic as to the result.******2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1, March 8, 1929.o
