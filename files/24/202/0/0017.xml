2     i)THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITAMNIO MAJESTIES GOVERNMENT. S !jC RET CABINET.--&quot; NOTE Off MR.  LLOYD GEORGE &apos;S SPEECH OP 1stMARCH, 1929.Memorandum by the Minister of Transport.I feel that I should put before the Cabinet some observations on the speech delivered by Mr. Lloyd George on Friday, 1st March, which dealt so largely with roads.3h      Mr,  Lloyd George &apos; s statement that &quot;Nothinghas been done&quot; tm the &quot;national system of trunk roads since&quot;the beginning of the&quot;l9th Century&apos;&apos;.(a) Over 200 miles of new arterial roads have been constructed in the Greater London Area since 1920,      Most of them are about 100 feet between fences.      This London arterial road programme was initiated by Mr. Lloyd George himself in 1920.      It covers practically the whole of the Greater London Arterial Road programme, recommended by conferences convened by Mr.  John Burns before the war, together with several important additions.    The cost of these schemes has exceeded  14 millions,(b) Similar programmes on a smaller scale have been initiated in the past nine years in the neighbourhood of all great centres of population e. g. the Birmingham - Wolverhampton Road, the Edinburgh - Glasgow Road, the Newcastle - Tynemouth Road, the Mid-Glamorgan inter-valley road, Ring Roads round Sheffield, Leeds, Ipswich, &amp;c., and the Liverpool - East Lancashire Road which is about to be commenced.(c) In 1924 a programme for the reconstruction and modernization of the most important trunk roads in the country was put in hand for the relief of unemployment.       The contribution from the Road Fund was  S-g- millions towards a total expenditure of about  8 millions.       This programme is approaching completion, and covers about 400 miles of trunk roads including bridges on them.
Among the important new bridges which have recently beensconstructed or are approaching completion are the following Berwick Bridge f Newoo-stlo-on-tyne - Gate ahead Bridge, Boothforry Bridge, Queonsforry Bridge (Dee), Bridges at Shrewsbury9 Atcham &amp;c.The Merney Tunnel is under construction involving a contribution of  2g millions from the Road Fund towards a total expenditure of  5 millions,,Under these five headings., which cover successive programmes of works expedited for the relief of unemployment, a contribution of about  37 millions will have been made from national funds towards a total expenditure of  57 millions. Out of this total of  57 millionss  26 millions have been spent since 1924^ and a svsn of  .13 millions remains to be spent.Quite apart from the large programmes referred to above grants during the last four years to new reconstruction and widening a 3 diversions., improvements &amp;c0 on classified roads have been made as followsThe total expenditure on these schemes has been about  18 millions.    This assistance is entirely additional to the maintenance grants to Class I and Glass II roads which now amount to about  10 millions per annum, and next year, owing to the increases in the rates of assistance which have recently been announced9 will amount to  12 millions. 1925-26 1926-27 1927-28 1928-291*500,000 2,3009000 2,, 300 ,000 2,500 ,000  8,600*000
Among the important new &quot;bridges which have recently been constructed or are approaching completion are the following:* Berwick Bridge, Newco.stlO&quot;On-Tyne - Gateshead Bridge, Boothforry Bridge, Queonsf erry Bridge (Dee), Bridges at Shrewsbury- At chum. &amp;cThe Mersey Tunnel is under construction involving a contribution of  2-1 millions from the Road Fund towards a total expenditure of  5 millions,,Under these five headings., which cover successive programmes of works expedited for the relief of unemployment, a contribution of about  37 millions will have been made from national funds towards a total expenditure of  57 millions. Out of this total of  57 millionss  26 millions have been spent since 192 4,, and a sum of  .13 millions remains to be spent.Quite apart from the large programmes referred to above grants during the last four years to new reconstruction and widenings, diversions., improvements &amp;c0 on classified roads have been made as followsThe total expenditure on these schemes has been about  18 millions.    This assistance is entirely additional to the maintenance grants to Class I and Glass II roads which now amount to about  10 millions per annum, and next year, 1925-26 1926-27 1927-28 1928-291.500,000 2,300,000 2, 300 ,000 2,500,000  8,600*000owing to the increases in the rates of assistance which have recently been announcedP will amount to  12 millions,,
227 &apos;iIncluded In these works which have been put in hand in the last 9 years are some 230 miles of by-pass roads -Mr, Lloyd George specially referred to the need for by-passes. Special sums have also been allocated recently for reconstruction of weak bridges and a Bill has been introduced in the House of Lords for facilitating the process.Heavy commitments have been entered into by the Read Fund in connection with the London s oh ernes recommended by the Royal Commission on Cross-River Traffic.     The estimate of the Royal Commission was  -271 millions and subsequent investigations have shown that in several directions their estimates are much too low.As regards three bridges (Richmond, Chiswick and Hampton Court) Parliamentary powers have been obtained and designs prepared.     Parliamentary powers are being sought for the construction of the New Viotc&amp;ria Dock Road, giving better access to the London Docks, at an estimated cost of ab*ut  3 millions.II.    Rural Roads. Since 1923 a sum of  Tfe millions has been set aside to assist highway authorities in the re-conditioning of important roads in rural areas to bring them to a standard required by the demands of modern traffic.Since 1926-27 maintenance grants of 25 per cent, have been made to selected unclassified roads in rural areas.     The grants now total about  if millions a year.III.    Mr. Lloyd George^ Proposal to raise a large loan for&quot;road works on the security of the Road Fund,The policy of successive Governments has been to leavethe responsibility for the improvement and maintenance *f roadswhere it now rests, i,e, on the highway authorities of thecountry.
Most of these authorities are, and have been for several years, working practically to their full capacity within the limits of their present resources.   Fortunately the Road Fund has been able to meet all demands, as they fall duo, out of the year&apos;s revenue.   The local authorities have similarly been meeting their expenditure out of revenue, or short term loans - usually 7 to 15 years according to the nature of the work.This would appear to be the most economical method of financing highway development and by this means the roads of the country have been so maintained and improved as to enable them to carry vehicles which have doubled in number in the last six years.As was suggested in the Memorandum to the Cabinet Co P.325 (28) of 2nd November, 1928, it would be possible to-initiate an extension of the trunk road reconstruction programme, on a   basis of 75 per cent grants, involving a total expenditure over Great Britain of  8 millions.Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s alternative would apparently be to press forward at once with a vast programme of road improvement and construction, financed entirely from national funds, raised by way of loan on the security of the Road Fund. This could only be done by the central Department itself, and would be the signal for the supersession of the highway authorities of the country and the setting up of a centralised national road system.Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s suggestion that sufficient work could be put in hand In the first year to absorb hundreds of thousands of unemployed men is preposterous.    Surveys have to be made, land acquired, specifications prepared and contracts entered into before employment could be offered on any appreciable scale.    Neglect of these ordinary precautions
5th March, 1929.ln embarking on schemes of such magnitude leads inevitably to extravagant and wasteful expenditure.XV.      Acquisition of land frontages.Under the Development and Roads Improvement Fund Act, 1909, the Minister of Transport was given power to acquire a furlong strip on each side of a new road constructed by him. Local authorities have not this power:    some, authorities have made representations that similar powers should be extended to them, but there are no signs of any general inclination on the part of local authorities to embark on a policy of speculative land acquisition on any extensive scale.In the case of several of the new arterial roads In the metropolitan area the advice of the Land Valuation Department was sought as to whether the prospect of recoupment was sufficiently good to justify the Minister In himself undertaking the xverk instead of the local authority, in order that his powers under the 1909 Act might be brought into play.      In each case the reply was unfavourable.The Kingston By-Pass mentioned by Mr. Lloyd George was constructed by the Surrey County Council who regarded it as essential that road works in their county should be carried out by themselves.    No powers were therefore available to acquire frontage lands for purposes of recoupment,It may be noted that Mr. Lloyd George has on previous occasions made calculations, which have been falsified by , the event, as to the increases to be anticipated In site values.(Intld. )   W.A.
