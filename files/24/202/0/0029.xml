This Document ia the Property oi His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.fO  BE KEPT  UNDER  LOCK  AND  KEY.SECRET.It is requested that special care may be taken to ensure the secrecy of this document.No.  25CP. 79 (29).I circulate to my colleagues a secret memorandum on the situation in Russia. I request that it may be treated as strictly confidential.THE outstanding features of the last six months are the shortage in the food supply, the internal dissensions in the Communist party, which have resulted in the formation of definite parties, and the great aggravation of the hostility between the towns and the country. The conflicting claims and demands of industry and agriculture are the crucial question in Russia to-day.In the early spring of 1928 it seemed that Stalin, having crushed the Trotskian opposition, had been left supreme and unchallenged throughout the Union and in a position to carry out his policy of the &quot; sovietisation&quot; of agriculture and the consequent oppression, not to say extermination, of the kulaki or well-to-do peasants. So widespread, however, was the discontent aroused in the country by the measures taken against the peasants that by the end of April there were already responsible officials who dared to raise their voices against the policy of the Government.In June, Erumkin, Vice-Commissar of Finance, addressed a letter to Stalin in which he warned him against the disastrous results of his policy, and by July the more moderate elements in the Communist party had succeeded in forcing the Government to raise the purchase price of corn by some 15 per cent, to 20 per cent. Emboldened by this success, these elements gradually crystallised into a definite opposition, now known as the Right Divergence, whose existence was acknowledged at a meeting of the Central Committee of the Communist party towards the end of September last. On this occasion one member stated that mischievous tendencies were beginning to appear, even in the Central Committee itself, as certain members were becoming sceptical and were criticising the party policy which they themselves had laid down. These persons, said another member, were apparently becoming bourgeois Ministers, pursuing policies which not infrequently ran counter to the policy of the party. These remarks were taken as a warning to Rikov and Kalinin, who, in the opinion of Stalin, were not only very pessimistic, but were indulging in attacks against his policy.- ^ Early in October the President of the Ogpu admitted the revival of anti-Soviet activities in the towns and villages. He attributed it to the formation of a new Opposition, which, while it included a heterogeneous mass of those dissatisfied with the Soviet power, had a criminal and anarchical basis. In support of this contention he cited the discovery of a secret explosives factory in Moscow. It was, he said, a movement savouring of pre-revolution communism. It was laying in stocks, not of the teachings of Lenin, Bukharin or Trotsky, but of knives and revolvers, and it did not hesitate to preach pogroms and terrorism against the Communists.As the month of October progressed and the date for the elections to the local Soviet approached, the various disruptive tendencies within the party became more clearly defined. Rikov, Kalinin and Kuibishev were associated in the popular estimation with the Right Divergence and a policy of conciliation.   Voroshilov andA. C.March 12, 1929.MEMORANDUM.THE SITUATION IN RUSSIA.[The Section on British and Foreign Investments has been supplied by theDepartment of Overseas Trade.]I. The Internal Political Situation.4753     [18834]b
Piatnitski represented the &quot; Left&quot; tendency on the Central Committee, while Stalin, Ordzhonikidze and Mikoyan were the Centre. The Right Divergence is reported to have the sympathy of the whole of the administrative apparatus of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, with the exception of the Militant Communists and of the Ogpu, which has remained Left in its allegiance.Early in October Stalin, at the sitting of the Central Committee, openly accused Rikov and Kuibishev of being the founders of the Right Divergence. These two worthies hastened to dissociate themselves from the movement, and protested that they were only too ready to fight it. Stalin, however, was not satisfied with these pious avowals, and he subsequently asked Rikov, Kalinin and Kuibishev point-blank whether they sympathised with the Right Divergence. If so, he said, they would have to declare their attitude at the forthcoming meeting of the Central Committee. The rank and file of the party, said Stalin, had received the impression that they Rikov, Kalinin and Kuibishev were opposed to the policy of industrialisation, and demanded a more conciliatory attitude towards the peasantry. Tomski, who was also present on this occasion, stated that the Right Divergence had appeared in the trades unions under the influence of rumours of war and of the food crisis; and on another occasion, about the middle of October, Unschlicht, Vice-Commissar for War, complained that the masses had lost interest in the defence of the country, and attributed this phenomenon to the growth of the Right Divergence. Towards the end of that month Kalinin and Rikov, at a meeting of the Soviet leaders, made penance for their flirtations with the Right.At the beginning of November the President of the Ogpu speaking on questions relating to the forthcoming eleventh anniversary celebrations, made some important statements regarding the two opposition movements. He evidently took the Right Opposition movement very seriously. It had, he said, made a breach in the party&apos;s strength in Moscow. It was &quot;expanding and winning new positions! &quot; He suggested at the same time that, in order to be free to combat the Right Divergence, the party should revise its attitude towards Trotsky. Conceivably, some form of agreement might be reached with him.Towards the end of November Stalin is reported to have made the most pessimistic speech which has ever come from him. In referring to the Right Opposition he even admitted the possibility of an overthrow of the present regime.After the full session of the party in November, at which Frumkin again criticised the Administration, it was decided at a meeting of the Politbureau to send him abroad to discuss the internal economic condition of the country in European financial circles, and at the same time to compel him to sign a statement that he was abandoning all work in support of the Opposition. Obviously he is being sent abroad on a mere pretext, in order that one more authoritative and dissentient voice may be removed. At the same time, the Soviet representatives abroad were instructed to publish a statement affirming that the severe measures adopted towards the Kulaki would be abandoned directly the local elections were past.During December reports from various sources indicated..that the Right Divergence was making headway in the army, which was already inclined to favour a strong Nationalist rather than a Communist policy.In the last few weeks the Soviet authorities have been seized with an access of nervousness in regard to the Trotskian or Left Opposition. Till recently they have apparently been entirely preoccupied with the struggle against the Right, but suddenly the &quot;Pravda&quot; of the 24th January published an article which may be called an indictment of the Left Opposition. At the same time, there appeared at the back of the paper a casual announcement in small print that some fifty Trotskyists had been arrested for anti-Soviet activities and conspiracies. The Trotski party were able to print and issue a manifesto to the effect that &quot; the economic situation in this country is going from bad to worse. Workers in the city are starving &quot;; but it produced no effect. According to the latest reports, Trotsky is to be sent to Angora and confined in the Soviet Embassy there. The Riga correspondent of the &quot;Times&quot; reported on the 3rd February that it had been &quot; decided, owing to the failure of the Central Control Commission to cope with alien elements in the party, to subject the entire party to another general purge. &apos; Pravda &apos; mentions 150,000 Communist officials as the approximate number for expulsion from the party during the impending &apos; spring cleaning.&apos; &quot;    .The Nationalist tendencies in the various Soviet Republics are causing the Central Government considerable anxiety. At a meeting in Moscow early in August 1928, Menzhinsky, president of the Ogpu, dwelt on troublesome tendencies in the National Republics.   The Ukrainian Communists had, he said, been raising
the question of these republics having a share in the control of foreign policy. Demands were being made for the abolition of conscription and for the separation of national forces. There was also a movement for a rearrangement of the Central Asiatic Republics.As the rebellion in Afghanistan developed, unrest in the Central Asia-tic Republics increased. According to statements made during the early part of January last, the Ogpu believed that there was a conspiracy in the Central Asiatic Republics against Soviet control, and a more lenient attitude towards the mullahs and the tribal organisations was recommended.Early in October last, the nervousness of official Soviet circles in the Ukraine was manifested by numerous arrests of persons suspected of separatism, strict surveillance on railways and control of travellers, and increased activities on the part of the secret police.All the republics have introduced their own language in their institutions, and have, as far as possible, replaced Russians by their own people. The desire to be free in their internal affairs and to carry out as little as possible the directions given by the Central Government is common to all the republics. In Georgia, all defence matters are in Georgian hands. The separatist movement is perhaps strongest in the Ukraine, and here the Central Government are in a quandary. They desire to encourage the Nationalist feeling as a bulwark against Poland, and at the same time they realise the danger which it involves to their own hegemony.Nearly all the republics are situated on the borders of Russia, and would there-fore be the first to suffer from a war. As a result they aspire to emancipation from the foreign policy of Moscow. The more nationally minded of the Communists of the Ukraine are inclined to form into groups and seek rapprochement with similarly minded men in the other republics. Petrovski, president of the All-Ukrainian Central Executive Committee, is reported to be secretly in sympathy with separatism.Anti-Soviet intrigues are being carried on by the Ukrainian emigres, led by Liwicki, head of the National Committee of the Ukrainian Republic in Prague, who is alleged to have been working in close collaboration with the Poles and, in particular, with the Polish General Staff. The Poles have apparently until recently been subsidising the Ukrainian movement, and, in addition, have been giving financial support to the independence movement of the Georgians, Azerbaijans and other Caucasian groups. The Polish plan has been to establish a strong Ukrainian group and the nucleus of a Ukrainian volunteer army, which would collaborate witb the Poles in the Ukraine in the event of wrar with the Soviet Government. Latterty, however, the Poles appear to have discontinued, or to have modified, the support they have been giving to those emigres. This change in policy is attributed to the acceptance of the Litvinoff protocol.II. The Foreign Political Situation.The foreign policy of the Soviet Government has not altered one jot or tittle. World revolution remains their avowed object, and their agents continue to foment agitation and unrest in every country, especially in Asia. Communist cells and centres are maintained, everywhere abroad, and money seems always forthcoming to promote sedition.Resort to war as a last desperate gamble on the part of the Soviet Government cannot be dismissed as altogether impossible, suicidal though it would be. A well-informed neutral observer, discussing in December last the downward curve in every sphere of life in Russia, expressed the belief that it was the fixed plan of the Soviet Government to engage in a foreign war when they were convinced that their position was no longer tenable in Russia. He thought the most likely adversary to be chosen was Poland, since a war against that country was the only one which Avould raise any national feeling among the peasantry. The feeling throughout Russia was strong against Poland, and in the Ukraine, which would be of special importance in the campaign, this feeling was at its strongest.On the other hand, Major Kobylanski, who for the last five years has been Polish military attache at Moscow, is disposed to think that Soviet military action against Poland and Roumania, which might have been possible up to the spring of 1928, is now most improbable. The army, which is composed chiefly of peasants, can no longer be absolutely relied on even for the maintenance of internal order. A war would be unpopular and, with the sinking moral of the army, would have no chance [18834] b 2
of success. Communications in Russia have deteriorated to such an extent that the maintenance of a war would be difficult.There seems no doubt that early in June last the Soviet leaders decided that, in view of the difficult political and economic crisis which lay before them, it was not only unavoidable, but also desirable and practicable, that war should break out on the Western frontier in the near future. The armed conflict should be limited to their two most dangerous enemies, Poland and Roumania. There was, however, a marked division of opinion among the leaders as to the expediency of such a policy&apos; Voroshiloff, the Commissar for War, was in the group favouring war as beinp&apos; the only means of averting calamity and finding escape from an impossible situation. The views of the war group seem to have prevailed to the extent that various important preparations for war were sanctioned. In October 1928, however, there was evidence to show that the influence of the &quot;War Group&quot; had declined, and that the views of the &quot;economists&quot; that there should be no resort to war until the Soviet Government had exhausted all possibilities of obtaining of credits from the United States of America, and elsewhere, and of consolidating the Soviet regime by peaceful means had prevailed. Information received since then has pointed to the possibility of resort to war having become even more remote, if for no other reason than the unpreparedness and decline in efficiency of the Red Army.Stalin is said to consider it advisable to await the outcome of the fprthcoming elections in Great Britain, in the hope that a Labour -Liberal combination will sweep the country and adopt a policy, if not less antagonistic, at least not involving interference in Soviet affairs. Meanwhile, the Soviet Government have notified their willingness to accede to the Kellogg Peace Pact, and have further taken the initiative in proposing to the Polish and Lithuanian Governments the signature of a protocol bringing the pact into force before its ratification by all the Governments concerned. It appears that the Soviet proposal was actuated, in part at least, by genuine fear of an attack from the West.III. The Economic Situation.The economic, like the internal political, situation, is dominated by the conflict between industry and agriculture. Before the war Russia was predominantly an agricultural State and her exports of agricultural produce went a long way towards paying for her. imports of manufactured goods. To-day there is no exportable surplus of agricultural produce. The Soviet authorities have concentrated their efforts on the development of industry at the expense of agriculture. The conversion of Russia into a modern industrial State would be a task of wellnigh superhuman difficulty, even if undertaken with the aid of millions of foreign capital and the best brains, experience and energy available in Europe and America. Without these the experiment was bound to prove a failure. The towns are dangerously short of food; at the same time the villages are equally short of manufactured commodities. It is a sidelight on the mentality of the rulers of Russia that, notwithstanding this state of affairs, potatoes are being exported from Russia to Einland, and Persia is being swamped with Russian cotton goods sold at less than cost price, in order to obtain foreign currency. Bread in Moscow costs about 30 per cent, more than m London, and is at the same time of vastly inferior quality. Industrial products of the poorest kind marketed in the villages cost at least 60 per cent, more than similar goods in the United Kingdom. At a moderate estimate the cost of living in Russia is 40 per cent, higher than in England, while even the most favoured of the industrial artisans receive wages equal to no more than 50 per cent, of the value of wages paid to similar artisans here. The authorities admit that during 1928 prices increased by 16-5 per cent, for agricultural produce and&apos;by 2-5 per cent, for industrial products. In such private trade as exists the increase is far larger. Meanwhile the purchasing price of the chervonetz has dropped to about 40 per cent, of its face value.Stalin, the present ruler of Russia, is determined to transform the Union into a highly industrialised State at any cost, and with all possible speed. Ele realises that his strength lies in the towns and factories, his weakness in the villages. Eor that reason he is endeavouring to increase industrial production by artificial and intensive methods, and feels no reluctance in sacrificing his 140 million peasant foes to his 4 million industrial friends. Since 1925 some 4,000 million roubles have been sunk in industry. According to figures published in the &quot; Pravda &quot; of the 25th November figures which should be accepted with some reserve the output of the large State industries has increased by 22 per cent., compared with last year, and the annual production of Soviet factories is about 35 per cent, greater than in 1914; but this represents a mere drop in the ocean of post-war requirements.  Despite the
vasts sums sunk in industry and the almost religious reverence with which high Soviet officials talk of &quot;rationalisation,&quot; &quot;efficiency&quot; and American methods, Soviet industry remains utterly inefficient. The authorities at their meetings do not disguise the true state of affairs, but unite in bewailing it. Decrees, resolutions and directives are poured forth, but the situation deteriorates steadily. The reasons are not far to seek. Technical engineers, chemists, foremen, and skilled workmen are almost entirely lacking. Add to this the deficiency of raw materials in many industries, the rampant peculation and corruption, the low level of output per man owing to underfeeding, the appalling social and housing conditions, and what the organ of the Trade Union Council described on the 1st August last as the &quot;menacing proportions of inebriety among the working classes &quot; the consumption of vodka has multiplied fifty times in the last four years and the present state of Russian industry is not surprising.A few instances will suffice. M. Kuibishev, the supreme controller of Soviet industry, has himself called attention to the electric lamp industry, in which 25 million lamps are produced per annum by 2,000 workmen, while at the General Electric Company&apos;s factories in the United States of America 250 million lamps are produced per annum by the same number of workmen. Recently the same authority has admitted that foreign machinery is lying at factories waiting until foreign engineers can be got to assemble and work it; that it is beyond the powers of the best Soviet chemical engineers to run a plant for the manufacture of nitric acid, which has been bought in Germany and erected in Russia by an Italian; and that several new textile finishing factories will not work during 1928-29 because there are no goods for them to finish. A long decree of the Council of Labour and Defence recapitulates a formidable list of mistakes made in the erection of four large modern paper factories. A huge ultra-modern machine at one of these factories requires thirty-three highly skilled workers to run it at full capacity, and there are only five available, and these Germans. The case of the glass industry is particularly instructive. In 1924 a Russian commission bought in England for 200,000 roubles the patent rights of a machine which they subsequently discovered had already been bought for 550,000 roubles by Arcos (Limited), who ascertained two weeks after their purchase that the patent rights had expired in 1913. In the United. States the commission bought two machines and patent rights for 900,000 roubles, and in April last, two years after their arrival, the machines were still lying unassembled. The output of the Sergief bottle factory, estimated at 20 million bottles from four machines at a cost of 4-6 kopeks per bottle, produced with two machines only 1^ million bottles at a cost of 40-50 kopeks per bottle. Referring to this factory the Central Committee of Chemical Workers reported that there was neither sand, water nor fuel near the site chosen, and the actual construction had been badly done. The factory could not be worked without further large expenditure, and it would be better to write off the 2 million roubles expended on it and close it. The story is much the same with other glass factories.The condition of the flax industry is equally illuminating. Before the war Russia exported flax largely. Now the Moscow looms are carrying- on with difficulty owing to the lack of raw material. The State is the sole purchaser of flax, and the price offered is very low. It pays the peasants better to grow cereals and dispose of them clandestinely than to grow flax, and they have consequently ceased flax cultivation. In vain the Soviet authorities increased their purchase price for flax by 22 per cent. They had hoped to obtain vast quantities of grain this autumn by flooding the villages with cheap textiles, but since the villages will not grow flax the plan has broken down.   The vicious circle is complete.Another important factor in the industrial situation is the question of transport. Even before the war the vast areas of the Russian Empire presented serious difficulties in this respect; and the deterioration of the railways during the war has not in any way been made good. Discipline is deplorable, drunkenness being very common and having led to serious accidents. Moreover, the efforts of the authorities are concentrated on carrying food-stuffs from Siberia and distant parts of the country to the industrial centres in Central Russia. The factories must take their chance and do the best they can.In a statement which he made about the middle of January last, the Commissary for Railways showed that the railway transport system was deteriorating to a disastrous extent, and that the fundamental cause was lack of working capital, which made it impossible to fulfil the Commissariat&apos;s programmes, as regards renewal and repair of engines and rolling-stock, reconditioning of the lines, &amp;c. In these respects the rot had gone so deep that, even if sufficient capital were now made available and he hoped that money would
be forthcoming from America and Germany it would take ten years to put things right. Conditions were worst on the railways east of Moscow, and on those in the North Caucasus, Siberia, and Central Asia. His department had to contend not only with a serious shortage of both higher and lower grade technicians, but also with administrative and labour troubles, and with underground agitation conducted by &quot; Trotskyists and counter-revolutionaries.&quot; Evidently the state of the railways is no better than that of industry generally.Turning to agriculture, the decline in grain cultivation is a serious menace to Russia. A competent observer estimates the area devoted to grain at 10 to 11 per cent, below the pre-war figure, while owing to the &quot;collectivisation&quot; of the farms, the yield per acre is much lower than before. The special acuteness of the food crisis this year is due, however, to a temporary phenomenon, viz., the failure of the harvest in the Ukraine. There is probably enough grain in Soviet Russia to meet the requirements of the whole population, but the great bulk of it is in Siberia and the transport difficulties are enormous. Moreover, the peasant is fighting tooth and nail against giving up his grain to the Government food-stocking organisations, since he finds he can sell it privately at a much.higher price.The plight of the peasant is but little, if any, better than that of the artisan. In October last Herr Paul Scheffer, the very able Moscow correspondent of the &quot;&apos;&apos; Berliner Tageblatt,&quot; wrote as follows : &quot; From 1926 onwards the pressure exerted by the State against the develop-ment of individual peasant farming became more and more noticeable. The Government showed more and more preference for combined farming, collective farms, Communist peasant combines and their like. The rich peasant was deprived more frequently of his political rights, more sharply taxed and placed more and more at a disadvantage by the State acting in its capacity as dealer and manufacturer in one. Last winter matters came to a head. The State thought that it discerned an attitude of passive resistance on the part of the peasants when it was gathering in the corn supplies. Compulsory measures were adopted. But all that was only a prologue. It is now having recourse to systematic measures in order to cope with the grave danger facing the dictatorship of the proletariat, thanks to the increase in the individualism of - the peasant.&quot; I do not think that as much as a tractor or a threshing machine is sold to any individual peasant to-day. These are reserved for State farms or collective farms, the number of which has quadrupled of recent months owing to the influence or pressure of the authorities and the party. With what success? It is more instructive to speak of the difficulties first of all. The promoters of this gigantic scheme generally admit that the &apos; Kombinate&apos; or combined farms produce less than the sum of the individual farms. I investigated m&amp;nj such &apos;Kombinate,&apos; but they failed to impress me. I observed much poverty and much neglect. The will to work appears to be weak, nor is the incentive very great. Wages are generally distributed according to the number of days worked. Naturally those who do more work and yet earn the same money as their lazier colleagues remonstrate. Despite considerable personal experience, I would not express myself so unfavourably were it not that complaints regarding diminished intensity of work and diminished sense of responsibility in these &apos;Kombinaten&apos; were general. Again and again the promoters of this policy bewail the fact that the &apos; social sense&apos; of the small peasant is deplorably low, and yet it is this social sense which is supposed to replace the driving force of personal gain and of independent existence in the case of millions of peasants in these grey Russian villages.&quot;A spirit of individualism still clings to these &apos;Kombinate,&apos; which the authorities are trying to eradicate. At Odessa there is a &apos; tractor-base,&apos; to which the whole district is subordinated. Thirty per cent, of the harvest has to be surrendered in return for the use of the tractors, but the &apos; base&apos; tends to interfere more and more, regulates the whole of the work and endeavours at all costs to reach its goal, namely, to convert the private peasant into a &apos; pure proletarian of the land.&apos; Where organisations of this kind on a large scale are considered possible, every method is employed to achieve success. In the Crimea, for instance, the peasant is given the choice of entering an organisation with a general levelling tendency or selling his farm and disappearing. Great haste is being displayed everywhere, and the whole of peasant Russia to-day is the theatre of a huge Socialist experiment.   Next year the &apos; Kombinate &apos; are only to
be allowed to sell their corn to the State. In that way the Communist ring is to be gradually closed.&quot;Admittedly the whole action springs from political and not at all from economic grounds. As persuasion is useless, recourse has to be had to compulsion. The prosperous peasant - must be forced to enter a communal organisation, and the necessary pressure is exerted through taxation. The rich peasant is hit by an &apos; individual tax,&apos; a tax which no doubt all Finance Ministers in the world will envy. This tax affects the presumed income and not the declared income, a fact which suffices to show that the taxation measures adopted in June were merely a weapon for undermining individualist enterprise and the possessions of the individuals in the village. They serve to drive the peasant into the &apos; Kombinate,&apos; in other words, into&apos;the Socialist paradise. The party exerts its influence on the application of the taxation weapon through the medium of &apos; village correspondents,&apos; who are appointed everywhere. Their work is dangerous, leading often to murder and homicide.&quot;In Germany a hard-working peasant with three horses, two cows and sixteen desyatin is not regarded as a social enemy, even if he may happen to have a Diesel motor. The ruined peasants to-day remember with bitterness the thanks showered upon them when they brought l&quot;,000 poods of corn to the State purchasing office. But since February taxation assessments have rained clown upon them; one horse after the other has had to be sold at the ruinous prices now obtaining, and one field after another comes under the hammer. I was in a house lately where the peasant offered me a chair, with the remark that it was no longer his. He had his latest taxation assessment in his pocket. Failure to pay means imprisonment.&quot;The scheme is being successful. The rich peasants are offering &apos; superfluous land &apos; to the commune, retaining 3 or 4 desyatin, and taking it with them if permitted into a &apos;Kollchoss.&apos; A profound change is taking place so far as the land is concerned throughout Russia. The loss of national income thereby involved defies calculation, as does the effect of this socialisatkm of millions of efficient and independent farmers.. Inestimable damage is being done to Russia by the annihilation of so much individual initiative and thrift. The State hopes to relieve itself of all future anxiety so far as the needs of the town and of export are concerned.&quot;Herr Scheffer, the writer of the above article, passed through Warsaw in December last. He told the German Minister there that every branch of, life was disintegrating rapidly in Russia- political, economic and financial. Conditions were becoming worse from day to day. The corn collection campaign had failed completely, the peasants were becoming more aggressive towards the Government, risings were more frequent. So far the Government had no difficulty in putting them down by force, as the movements against them were not organised. The dearth of commodities and ready-made goods was assuming alarming proportions and there were no prospects of improvement, as local production was steadily diminishing. The future depended exclusively on the attitude of the army. So long as the Govern-ment could feed, clothe and satisfy the demands of the army in general, no change would appear possible.In connexion with this last remark of Herr Scheffer, the seriousness of the food crisis can be estimated by the fact that in December last the special conference appointed to ensure the food supply of the Red Army admitted the possibility of its being necessary to decrease the ration. The ordinary workers &quot; must be given only that which is indispensable&quot; and to obtain this they have to wait in queues for hours.  Food queues have become part of normal life in the big towns.:- IY. British and Foreign Investments.It will be convenient to discuss this question under the three headings of (I) British Concessions; (II) British and Foreign Credits; (III) General Conclusions.(I.) British Concessions.(a.) Harriman Manganese Concession for Mining Manganese Ore in the Caucasus.The British interest in this concession amounted to only about 12 per cent., the remainder being American. The history of this concession will be found in a later section of this memorandum.
(b.) The Lena Gold fields Concession for Mining Gold and other Metals in the Urals and elsewhere.Owing to the existence of a large number of bearer shares, the British holding cannot be exactly ascertained, but on the strength of a verbal statement by one of the directors, it is known that the controlling interests are technically American. The position of the concession is understood to be less satisfactory than last year.(c.) The Ayan Mining Corporation for Gold Mining in Eastern Siberia.(d.) The Tetuihe Mining Corporation for Mining Lead and Zinc in Eastern Siberia.(e.) The Indo-European Telegraph Company.The company has operated its concession undisturbed for the last seven years.(f.) The formation, in conjunction with the Soviet authorities, of a mixed company by British shipping interests (Canadian Pacific Railway) for handling emigrant traffic.(g.) The Morgan Crucible Company.This firm is in a special position. Its former works in Leningrad have not been nationalised and are understood to be still in operation, but not on a concession basis.Of the above concessions, only (b) and. (e) are believed to be still in operation. In the case of most of the others, the foreign interests have withdrawn for various reasons, principally owing to the impossibility of working the concession on the terms originally agreed upon with the Soviet authorities.(II.) British and Foreign Credits.(1.) British Credits.The amount of information at the disposal of the Department of Overseas Trade is naturally limited, and a complete survey of the commercial credits accorded by British firms to the Soviet Government since 1918 is impossible without an intimate knowledge of the private affairs of various firms. The following information of a general nature, which has been obtained from a reliable source, will no doubt convey some idea of the amount and extent of commercial credit enjoyed by the Soviet Government in this country during the past few years.Of the total value of orders placed during 1926-27 by Soviet trading organisa-tions in the United Kingdom, some 43 per cent., or some  6,000,000, was on credit. This was stated to be an improvement over the preceding year, when the percentage of orders placed on credit was only 30 per cent, of the total value.In the case of food-stuffs and raw materials, the credit duration varied between four and six months, but in the case of machinery was as high as two years. The principal classes of manufactured goods and the average credit granted were : Agricultural machinery ... ... 9 months.Mining machinery ... ... ... 14-9 months.Electric&quot;plant       ... ... ... 23-3 months.Motors and motor cycles ... ... 12-15 months.No general statement for the year 1928 similar to the above can be furnished, but it is believed that in some specific cases, at any rate, there has been no diminution in the lengths of credit received by Soviet purchasing organs. There has, indeed, probably been an increase.The following specific instances where important British credits have been granted will be of interest : (a.) A contract granted in 1925 to British textile firms for the supply of machinery to the value of between one and two million sterling. In this case the total period of credit was two years. This contract has been satisfactorily completed, and new contracts to the value of over  500,000 have been placed during the past few months. In one recent case the period of credit is said to be five years. (b.) Contracts with British firms for the supply of plant to electrical power stations. These contracts have been operating over a period of years and very long credit is usually involved. The last contracts to the value of  250,000 placed in May last are stated by the firm concerned
(Metropolitan Vickers) to have been placed on &apos;&apos; comparatively long credit terms.&quot;   This would probably mean at least three years. (6&apos;.) Messrs: Babcock and Wilcox have been doing a more or less continuous business in boiler plant with the Soviet Union on fairly long credit terms.Another type of contract, involving British credit, is that concerning the purchase of Russian produce. Soviet trading organs usually obtain considerable advances prior to the shipment of the goods.   The following a.re instances : (a.) The Union Cold Storage, who have for a number of years been financing-exports of butter, poultry, &amp;c, from the Soviet Union. It is understood that this firm now works on a commission basis, but probably has considerable sums outstanding in the Soviet Union in connexion with poultry and live-stock.(b.) The Russo-British Grain Export Company a mixed company in which British interests are combined with Soviet for financing and handling the export of Soviet grain to the United Kingdom.(c.) Within the past few weeks it lias been reported in the press that an important contract has been signed between a number of leading British timber importers and the Soviet Government involving the purchase of some  10 million of Russian timber during the coming season. The existence of the agreement has been definitely confirmed to the Depart-ment of Overseas Trade by one of the firms concerned. There is little doubt that the object of the deal is to facilitate the financing of Soviet timber exports to the United Kingdom.As already indicated, it is impossible to give a detailed list of these contracts, of which there must be a considerable number, or even to state with certainty the actual amount involved in any particular contract. British firms do not usually approach the Department of Overseas Trade unless they meet with any difficulty in their contracts, and can hardly be expected to communicate the details of these contracts to the department unless specially requested to do so in confidence.(2.) German Credits.The Russo-German Commercial Treaty of October 1925 laid dowui the principle of German export credits for Russia, but the financial details of the scheme were not formulated until nearly a year afterwards, so that it has really only been in operation about two years.Under the scheme, credits of two kinds, of a total value of 300 million marks ( 15 million), could be granted, short-term credits of two years a good proportion of these two years&apos; credits placed early in 1927 are shortly due for payment by the Soviet Government and long-term credits of four&apos;years; In some cases payment does not commence till the third year. The German Reich guaranteed 35 per cent, of the risk, the Federal State in which the German exporter resided, 25 per cent. The exporter thus has to bear only the remaining 40 per cent.The results were at first very disappointing, partly because the volume of German exports to Russia did not increase to the extent expected, and partly because the Russians drove such hard bargains that the profits of the German exporters were reduced to a small margin. The credit agreement between the two Governments expired on the 31st March, 1927, and, according to the German press, not only was the total amount of the credit of 300 million marks used up, but the Soviet trade delegation in Berlin had placed orders for an additional 60 million marks. The statistics of German exports to the Soviet Union* show an increase in 1927 and 1928 over previous years, but it is not possible to estimate wdiat proportion of these exports was covered by the credit scheme.The treaty of 1925 proved unsatisfactory, especially in connexion with matters affecting the protection and movements of German nationals and their property in the Soviet Union, and negotiations were resumed in 1928 between the two Govern-ments with a view to clarifying and amplifying it.In reporting the progress of these negotiations, which were broken off during 1928 and not resumed till the autumn, His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Berlin stated on the 7th December, 1928, that the German Government had little hope that their commercial relations would be materially improved. The results of the negotiations appear in a protocol signed on the 21st December, but there is no mention of any[18834]* See pag-e 12.C
new credits. His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Berlin stated that it was not the intention of the Germans to give credits at present, but that towards the end of March 1029, when the short-term credits under the 300-million-mark scheme fall due, they might be induced to give new credits for the same amoiint, thus converting the original credit into a revolving one.Reports have appeared in the press of a &quot; German Week &quot; in Moscow, organised in January, to demonstrate the latest German technical developments. This event coincided with the arrival in Moscow of the newly-appointed German Ambassador. No official information is available on this subject.The Department of Overseas Trade have been informed by a British official in close contact with responsible Soviet citizens in this country that there is u feeling in Russia to-day that far greater technical ability exists in Great Britain than is generally known, that the Soviet Government are aware of this, and that it is for this reason that they have from time to time sent over technical experts to this country for the purpose of scientific or industrial research. It is also understood that the Soviet Government were inclined to suspect German technicians of confusing the pursuit of technical knowledge with that of the commercial interests of their country, and for that reason the Soviet Government are apparently anxious that they shall not be driven to rely for technical advice upon Germany alone.German investors in the Mologa timber concession are estimated to have lost at least 20 million marks. There is little doubt that commercial and financial circles in Germany are coming to regret the infectious optimism of Count Brockdorff-Rantzau, the late German Ambassador in Moscow, and are growing disillusioned regarding the prospects of exploiting Russia. Herr von kuhlmann, for instance, who has special opportunity for watching the flow of German investments in Russian enterprise, recently informed a member of the staff of His Majesty&apos;s Embassy in Berlin that even the most enthusiastic of Count Brockclorff-Rantzau&apos;s &quot;dupes&quot; were now withdrawing the sums which he had induced them to lend to Russian organisations. In many cases these loans had already disappeared into buildings and plant, and the Russians were manifesting great obstinacy and dishonesty in evading the payment of interest and the terms of contracts and concessions. Herr von Kuhlmann expressed the opinion that Germany and England would one day make great fortunes by co-operating on the Russian market, but he did not think that that day would arrive within the next fifteen years. Meanwhile, such German magnates as had listened to the advice of Count Brockdorff-Rantzau had badly burnt their fingers, and were feeling somewhat bitter on the subject.(3.) American Credits.In spite of the claims of the Soviet press, there has been no grant of credits on a wide scale by American business firms. The Soviet trading organ in the the United States of America, corresponding to Arcos, has transacted a considerable amount of business, and the actual volume of Soviet purchases in the United States of America has been exceeded during the last two years only by those made in Germany. The usual terms of payment and the length of credit do not appear to have differed very largely from those accorded in the ordinary way of business by British firms, viz., a cash payment with the order and the remainder in bills due in three, six or nine months. Few cases have occurred where long credits similar to some of the specific cases quoted above have been accorded by American firms. The more recent and notable isolated instance is the case of the International General Electric Company. According to press reports, the contract involves the supply of electrical apparatus of between 5 and 10 million dollars in value, a cash payment cf 25 per cent, being made with the order; the remainder to be made in acceptances, falling due periodically over a period of five years. It was also reported that the agreement incorporated a provision for the settlement, on completion of the contract, of the American company&apos;s claims against the Soviet Government arising from acts of nationalisation. This contract has been hailed by the Soviet press as a most important step in Soviet relations with the United States of America. It is stated that the president of the State Bank of Moscow is shortly visiting the United States of America to persuade American firms to use their influence to induce the United States of America Government to withdraw their ban of the raising of Soviet loans in America.The facts are very different, and it seems doubtful whether this transaction can truly be called one of credit in a narrow sense.
According to more critical press sources, the 75 per cent credit referred to in the General Electric Company&apos;s contract is to be secured as follows :  The guarantee of the State Bank endorsed by the National City Bank of New York. As a security for this guarantee, platinum to the value of 25 per cent, of the amount and other precious metals to the value of 35 per cent, are to be deposited with the National City Bank, which also obtains a first mortgage on the Soviet Mercantile Fleet. Moreover, the National City Bank has received an undertaking [sic] that it will have a lien on all goods in the hands of Soviet trading organs in Europe, and in addition receives a sum of 3 million dollars on current account.The above terms, though unconfirmed from any official sources, appear not unlikely, and indicate the lengths to which the Soviet Government appear to be willing to go to secure the appearance of long credit from American sources.The Harriman Concession, known as the Georgian Manganese Company, was obtained in 1925 by Mr. Harriman on condition that he spent 4 million dollars within five years 1 million on a loading elevator, 2 million on the railway from Chiatury, and 1 million on the works at Chiatury. The concession was to be paid for by a fixed payment in dollars per ton of ore exported. A minimum programme of production and export was laid down, and the concession was to run for twenty years. The company further had to lodge a deposit of 1 million dollars in a foreign bank and also pay to the State Bank an advance of 1 million dollars against future payments to the Government.Disputes occurred in 1925 and 1926, particularly over demands made through &quot; Red&apos;&quot; trade unions and collective labour contracts. Several supplementary agree-ments were reached, but nothing better than a temporary improvement was achieved. Then the Soviet Government provoked a most serious conflict by unexpectedly importing Ukrainian manganese from Nikopol and spoiling the Harriman group&apos;s market abroad.In October 1928 Mr. Harriman&apos;s company decided to clear out of Georgia owing to the impossibility of working the concession on a satisfactory basis. The Soviet Government are said to have given Mr. Harriman 3^ million 7 per cent, rouble debentures, to mature in fifteen years, but this does not amount to the total sum lost over the concession.The &quot; Economic Survey&quot; of the Russian State Bank, in its issue of the 7th November, 1928, argued that the failure of the Harriman Concession was due to the &quot; high price &quot; policy which Air. Harriman immediately proclaimed, and which could only have been justified by the condition that no change was made in the supply of manganese ore to the world, and particularly to the United States of America market. The first blow to Harriman&apos;s plans was the decision of the United States Government to protect the manganese industry, and the second blow was delivered by the extraordinarily rapid development of the manganese industry on the Gold Coast, as a result of Harriman&apos;s &quot; high price &quot; policy, which transformed the Gold Coast manganese mines into commercially profitable enterprises. The only solution, according to the State Bank, would have been to adopt the principle of low prices, but this would have entailed the immediate investment of large amounts of capital, which Harriman was either unable or unwilling to undertake.According to the &quot; Daily Express &quot; of the 2nd February, negotiations are in progress between the Soviet Government, the Russo-Asiatic Consolidated and the Guggenheim and Harriman interests of America the Russo-Asiatic Consolidated is the huge British concessionaire company, run by Mr. Leslie Urquhart, whose properties have been seized by the Soviet Government. The basis of the negotiations is said to be the restitution of the Russo-Asiatic properties and the settlement of their claim by the issue of Soviet Government bonds. If an agreement materialises, it will be an important step forward in the resumption of commercial relations between the three countries.(III.) General Conclusions.It will not be out of place to record the general views of the Department of Overseas Trade on the question of Anglo-Russian trade, since their most vivid orpressions are largely based upon conversations with individual traders avIio seek their advice when contemplating credit transactions with the Soviet Union.It is clear, from a scrutiny of the classes of industry which have been most prone to grant credits to the Soviet Government, that it was just those classes who were [18834] d
most affected by the prevailing industrial depression who, in the end, granted the longest credits to the Soviet; needs must&quot;, when the devil drives. It is equally true that the Soviet Government have been impelled by their own internal economic position to demand credits, since immediate payment for large orders was impossible.In discussing the matter with representatives of British firms, the Department have always endeavoured to regard the matter entirely from a commercial point of view. They have rehearsed what may be called the standing arguments for and against giving credit, including the fact that no known case of repudiation of such credits on the part of the U.S.S.R. exists, and have only varied this advice in accordance with their information regarding the growing difficulties of the Soviet Union, in particular the adverse trade balance of the Union considered as a whole, which amounts to not less than an aggregate of over 300,000,000 roubles in the past four years. It has been apparent from these conversations that the hesitation and reluctance in granting credit to the Soviet Union was genuinely inspired by British firms&apos; own reflections upon the economic conditions prevailing therein and the results of the system of the monopoly of foreign trade, as well as by a genuine dislike of the ethical principle involved in the repudiation of debts. True, from time to time manufacturers have pressed the Department to extend the Export Credits Guarantee Scheme to the Soviet Union, but such requests have fallen off lately and commercial opinion seems rather to have swung round in favour of looking to the Soviet them-selves rather than to the British Government to provide more tangible security in return for the credits asked.The following tables show British, German and American imports from and exports to Russia during the last few years : Russian Exports to Great Britain.British Exports to Russia.1920 1921 1922 1923 1924 1925 1926 19271928 (January-November)...In million   (approximate).1733i 2i9* 20 251 24 21 2011191 141 11 41^21925 1926 19271928 (first 9 months)1924 1925 1926 19271928 (first 9 months)1925 1926 1927German Exports to Russia.In million   (approximate).12 13 16 16Russian Exports to Germany.In million   (approximate) 6-in ^(including&apos;bullion r &apos; I      and specie)24 262i 1 2 2 11Russian Exports        D-S.

Y. General Conclusions.All the reports and information which have reached the Foreign Office during the last few months show a striking unanimity in regard to the marked deterioration which has taken place lately in every sphere of public and private life in Eussia; and it is interesting to learn that the Bolsheviks themselves date this rapid deterioration-tion from the rupture of relations with this country. The villages are seething with discontent; open grumbling is heard in the towns, even amongst the textile workers of Moscow, once &quot;the vanguard of the proletariat.&quot; In any country but Russia a revolution would be imminent the population would not and could not endure their miseries. Competent observers, however, are united in thinking that the Soviet Government will weather the storm this time. . There seems no possible alternative Government probably even the towns and villages would join hands in repelling the Romanoffs and the emigres. It is rumoured that the Red Army is not absolutely reliable, but there is no definite or convincing evidence to that effect; and so long as the Government can count on the army, any attempts at revolution would take the form of isolated and easily suppressed risings. The utmost apparently for which one can hope is a gradual swing to the right on the part of the present rulers of Russia. For the moment Stalin has triumphed; but it seems hardly credible that he will be able to maintain his position and carry out his policy in the teeth of the formidable opposition which has arisen. The Communist party is now so rent by internal dissension that the pure and undefiled doctrines of Lenin can no longer be preserved as a religion. The imperative need of foreign capital and foreign expert advice, if a complete breakdown of the machine is to be averted, may compel a change of head if not of heart. Meanwhile, nothing would delay a change so much as overtures from His Majesty&apos;s Government and a resumption of diplomatic relations with this country.It would seem that the growth of the present &quot; Right Opposition &quot; is primarily due to the force of economic pressure, and that the movement to the right will only continue so long as that, pressure is felt and the Soviet leaders are compelled to avert calamity by their own unaided efforts. The grant of foreign credits would give the Soviet leaders a further breathing space, alleviate the pressure which is necessitating a return to normality, and would do little more than prolong the existence of the Communist regime and of a regime antagonistic to the givers.The Department of Overseas Trade record as their considered opinion that &quot;the present moment is particularly inopportune for the manifestation by the business world of too much interest in the industrial situation of the Soviet Union, especially by the despatch of business missions to Russia. Information recently received from many different sources points irrefutably to the probability of a serious economic crisis occurring during the coming spring; a crisis, not perhaps sufficient to obtain sensational political results, but yet cogent enough to induce the. Soviet Government sensibly to modify their attitude towards British commercial opinion, perhaps even to loosen, if not to cut, the bonds of the monopoly of foreign trade.&quot;G. H.
