At their Meeting on Jjareh 6th 1989 (Cabinet 10(29.^Gonolusion 3), the Cabinet had under consideration a Report of the East African Commission (Paper C0?0 3(29)) and Memoranda by the Secretary of State for the colonies and the Secretary of State for India, and agreed that the Committee on Policy in East Africa should be reassembled, as soon as the views of the Government of India had been received to consider the instructions to be given to Six&apos; Samuel Wilson, the Permanent Under Secretary of State for the colonies, on the occasion of his forthcoming visit to East Africa.2n The Committee recommend that the instructions to Sir SamuelWilson should be in the following termsYou are to proceed to East Africa in order to discuss the recommendations ox the Hilton Young Commission for the closer union of Kenya^ Tanganyika and Uganda,   (and such possible modifications of these proposals for effecting the object in view as may appear desirable) with the Governments concerned and also with any todies or individuals representing the various interests and communities affected, with a view to seeing how far It may be possible to find a basis of general agreement. You are to ascertain on what lines a scheme for closer union would be administratively workable and otherwise acceptable, and to report the outcome of your c onsultat ions .3. The Committee also recommend that the Government1s decision should be communicated to the House of Commons by the Secretary of State for- the Colonies before the Easter Recess by means of the following Question and Answer,
To ask the Secretary of State for the Colonies what action is contemplated by the Government with regard to the recommendations of the Report of the recent Commission on Closer Union in East Africa  (Cmd, 5234), and what machinery is proposed for giving effect to his undertaking that local opinion in East Africa will be consulted before any final commitments are entered into.I propose to ask Sir Sarm el Wilson, the Permanent Under Secretary of State at the Colonial Office, to proceed to East Africa as soon as possible in order to discuss the recommendations of the Hilton Young Commission for the closer union of Kenya, Tanganyika and Uganda,  and suchpossible modifications of these proposals for effecting........    .    .:   ........ .........  ...   ..........   . .  .   ..    .   ..        ...the object in view as may appear desirable, with the Governments concerned and also with any bodies or individuals representing the various interests and communitie affected,   with a view to seeing how far it may be possible to find a basis of general agreement.      It will be his task to ascertain on what lines a scheme for clcser union would be administratively workable and otherwise acceptable, and to report the outcome of his consultations.     His report obviously will not be available until after the General Election, but any proposals for action arising out of It will,  In so far as the present Government are concerned,  be submitted to Parliament before any final decision is taken.
In the event of a Supplementary Question being askedwith regard to the Kenya franchise, the Committee suggest thatthe Answer should be as follows -&quot;Whatever may be the ultimate Ideal as to the basis of the franchise iii the future f the matter is one which can obviously only ho settled by agreement, as suggested by the Commission.    Unless and until there xs such general agreement His Majestyrs Gover.nm.ent would not be justified in depart-ing from the policy laid down In 1925&quot;.5.    If .ln a further Supplementary Question the Government are asked whether they accept the view of the majority of the Commission that there can be no question of responsible Government in those territories until the natives can share in the responsibility.      The Committee recommend that the Answer should be -&quot;The policy of the Government in this matter Is set out In the two White Papers (Cmd.  1982 and Cmd,  2 904). Responsible Government is not in question within any period of time which need now be taken into consideration,.   We are prepared, however, as a part of a scheme of closer union, to ccn^ aider a carefully guarded advance In the association of an unofficial element in the responsibilities of trusteeship.    Any future progress towards self-government must be left to take the lines which the passage of time and the growth of experience may indicate a&quot;Sighed on behalf of the Committee LoS* AMBRY.ChairmanaWhitehall Gardens, 3.1,1.
