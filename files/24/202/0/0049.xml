[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.   March 1929.SECRET. Copy No.    28CP. 99 (29).CABINET.ARBITRATION TREATIES WITH FOREIGN POWERS.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.I CIRCULATE to my colleagues copies of correspondence with &quot;His Majesty&apos;s Government in the Irish Free State on the subject of an intimation by the Free State Government, in connection with the suggested renewal of the recently expired Arbitration Treaties with France, Italy and Spain, that they proposed to negotiate separate Arbitration Treaties with these countries. My despatch of the 22nd March was sent as the result of discussion (at which the Prime Minister was present) by a special Sub-Committee of the Sub-Committee on Belligerent Rights, consisting of Lord Salisbury, the Lord Chancellor, the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and myself.I also circulate a copy of a despatch from the Irish Free State Government as to the proposed new Arbitration Treaty with the United States of America, in which the suggestion for separate Arbitration Treaties is reiterated. It has been explained semi-officially to the Free State Government that my despatch of the 22nd March had been prepared before this despatch was received.L. S. A.Dominions Office, March 25, 1929.APPENDIX.No. 1.Despatch to Irish Free State Government.(Confidential.)Sir, Downing Street, October 26, 1928.WITH reference to the Duke of Devonshire&apos;s despatch No. 577 of the 25th September, 1923, I have the honour to transmit, for the consideration of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the Irish Free State, copies of telegrams to the other Dominions regarding the proposed provisional renewal of the existing Arbitration Agreements with France, Italy and Spain. His Majesty&apos;s Government in Great Britain would be grateful if they could be informed, as soon as possible, whether the course proposed in these telegrams would be in accordance with the wishes of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the Irish Free State.I have, &amp;c.L.

Enclosure 1 in No. 1.Telegram to Governments of Canada, Commonwealth of Australia, Neiv Zealand,Union of South Africa and Newfoundland.CIRCULAR A, No. 50, 24th October, Confidential. My despatch 13th October, 1923, Dominions No. 385. Question has arisen as to provisional renewal of existing Arbitration Agreement with France which expired 14th October. Action in the direction of renewal has hitherto been deferred pending decision on question whether instead of renewal of existing Agreement in its present form, it might be preferable to endeavour to negotiate a new Treaty with France on more extended lines. (In this connection please see my despatch of the 15th March, Dominions No. 135, Confidential, as to proposed new Treaty with United States.) This question is still under examination, but as existing ApTeement has already lapsed it would seem desirable to make some temporary arrangement, and most satisfactory course would appear to be to arrange exchange of notes with French Ambassador in London providing for renewal of existing Arbitration Agreement with France pending the conclusion of a new treaty. It would seem that such an exchange of notes, if effected, would most appropriately be expressed in the terms of draft which is being-telegraphed separately. His Majesty&apos;s Government in Great Britain would be grateful if they could be informed by telegraph as soon as possible whether procedure on these lines would be agreeable to His Majesty&apos;s Governments in the Dominions.Similar question may arise in connection with Arbitration Agreements with Italy and Spain which are due to expire on the 1st February, 1929, and the 26th February, 1929, respectively (see my despatch of the 21st November, 1923, Dominions No. 434 and my despatch of the 26th March, 1924, Dominions No. 139). If course proposed in case of Agreement with France is agreeable to Dominion Governments it is proposed to take similar action in connection with Agreements with Italy and Spain, if the necessity arises.

My telegram of to-day Circular A, No. 50.  Following are terms of proposed note to French Ambassador : Begins: I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your note of this day&apos;s date informing me that, pending the conclusion of a new treaty, the French Government would be glad to renew from to-day&apos;s date the Arbitration Agreement concluded with the Government of the French Republic on the 14th October, 1903.I have the honour to inform you that His Majesty&apos;s Governments accept this proposal, and the present exchange of notes is accordingly to be regarded as placing on record the understanding arrived at in the matter. Ends. Amery.No. 2.Despatch from Irish Free State Government.(Despatch No. 33.)(Confidential.) Department of External Affairs,Sir, Irish Free State, January 31, 1929.I HAVE the honour to refer to your Confidential despatch of the 14th December last and to previous correspondence regarding the proposed renewal of Arbitration Treaties with France, Italy and Spain.2. His Majesty&apos;s Government in the Irish Free State, having carefully considered this question, have decided not to renew these treaties. They feel that there is no reason to continue the practice which existed prior to the Imperial Conference, 1926, whereby the Governments of the Commonwealth not parties to the original agreements renew these treaties by means of an exchange of notes.
3. His Majesty&apos;s Government intend to intimate to France, Italy and Spain, with whom discussions have already been opened for the conclusion of commercial treaties, that they are prepared at the same time to conclude arbitration treaties. In the meantime, His Majesty&apos;s Government do not anticipate that any inconvenience will occur owing to the absence of arbitration treaties between the Irish Free State and these countries.I have, &amp;c. (Signed) P. McGlLLIGAN,Minister for External Affairs.The Right honourable the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, Downing Street, London, S.W. 1.No. 3.Despatch to Irish Free State Government.(No. 124.) (Confidential.)Sir, . Downing Street, March 22, 1929.I HAVE the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your Confidential despatch No. 33 of the 31st January on the subject of the proposed renewal of the recently expired Arbitration Treaties with France, Italy and Spain.2. His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom are in full agreement with His Majesty&apos;s Government in the Irish Free State in holding the view that it is preferable in such cases to replace existing general Arbitration Treaties by new Treaties between Fleads of States to be negotiated and signed in accordance with the principles set out in the Report of the Imperial Conference, 1926, rather than to renew them by means of exchanges of notes. It was, indeed, with the object of facilitating the ultimate adoption of this policy that the proposals contained in the enclosure to my Confidential despatch of the 26th October were designed. It was felt, however, that no progress could be made with the negotiation of new Arbitration Treaties with other countries until a decision had been reached by His Majesty&apos;s Governments jointly as to the policy to be adopted in the case of the draft Arbitration Treaty with the United States of America, and that, in view of the gravity and complexity of the issues involved, some time must necessarily elapse before any such decision could be expected. (In this connection I would invite reference to my Confidential despatch, Dominions, No. 135, of the 15th March, 1928, and connected correspondence.) On the other hand, the existing Arbitration Treaty with France had already expired, while the Treaties with Italy and Spain were due to expire on the 1st February, 1929, and the 26th February, 1929, respectively. If, therefore, His Majesty&apos;s Governments were to defer any action until they were in a position to enter into negotiations for the conclusion of new Treaties, there would be an interval during which no general arbitration engagements, with those countries would be in operation.3. It would seem regrettable on general grounds that there should be any such interval, but if any difficulty is felt in connection with a temporary renewal of the Treaties in the existing form by means of an exchange of notes as not being in accordance with present constitutional practice, His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom would not, so far as they are concerned, desire to press the proposal for renewal. They would, however, point out that all the other Dominion Governments have intimated their concurrence in the proposed renewal, which would naturally be on the understanding that the earliest possible steps would be taken by His Majesty&apos;s Governments jointly to negotiate new Treaties in the form recommended by the Imperial Conference of 1926.4. His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom observe, however, from the last paragraph of your despatch under reply that His Majesty&apos;s Government in the Irish Free State intend to intimate to the French, Spanish and Italian Govern-ments, with whom negotiations for Commercial Treaties have already been opened, that they are prepared at the same time to conclude Arbitration Treaties. The question of making any such intimation raises important issues of principle on which [19042] ii 2
His Majesty?s Government in the United Kingdom desire to make the following comments : 5. It will be remembered that the discussion at the Imperial Conference, 1926, on the subject of compulsory Arbitration proceeded on the assumption that the matter was one upon which it was essential that there should be uniformity of action on the part of all the Governments of the Empire. No suggestion in a contrary sense was made by the representative of any of His Majesty&apos;s Governments at the discussion, and the conclusion arrived at was recorded in the Summary of Proceed-ings of the Conference in the following words : &quot;A general understanding was reached that none of the Governments represented at the Imperial Conference would take any action in the direction of the acceptance of the compulsory jurisdiction of the Permanent Court, without bringing up the matter for further discussion.&quot;6. The recent correspondence between His Majesty&apos;s Governments on the draft Arbitration Treaty with the United States of America and the question of signing the Optional Clause has proceeded on the same assumption. As regards the negotiations with the United States, it has been contemplated that any new Treaty would be between Heads of States, and would be signed on behalf of all parts of the British Empire in the form set out on page 29 of the Summary of Proceedings of the Imperial Conference (Cmd. 2768), and it was anticipated that, if and when new Treaties should be negotiated with France, Italy, Spain and other Powers, the same form would be adopted.7. It is, of course, as His Majesty&apos;s Government in the Irish Free State will recognise, the accepted principle, underlying all the recommendations of the Imperial Conference of 1926, that there should be complete co-operation between all His Majesty&apos;s Governments in all important issues of policy affecting more than one part of the Commonwealth or the whole Commonwealth. In the present case, it will be appreciated that there is no desire whatever to ask any of His Majesty&apos;s Governments to commit themselves to a policy formulated by one of those Govern-ments; on the contrary, the only desire of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom is that there should be complete co-operation in the formation of a common policy. The. question of general arbitration engagements is one of such complexity and difficulty that the fullest possible exchange of view between all the Governments of the Commonwealth is clearly necessary for its elucidation. His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment in the United Kingdom have lately been giving much thought to the various issues involved in this very difficult problem, but have not so far been able to arrive even at preliminary conclusions. In their study of the subject so far as it has progressed, His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom have derived valuable assistance from the observations and suggestions which have been made by various Dominion Governments, and they would greatly appreciate any views which His Majesty&apos;s Government in the Irish Free State may be able to contribute.8. It may be desirable at this point to observe that the discussion and correspondence mentioned in the preceding paragraphs related of course to general Arbitration Treaties intended to provide a method, alternative to war, of settling serious international disputes, and it is to arbitration in this sense that the present observations of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom are directed. To the ordinary clause inserted in a non-political treaty to provide for arbitrating disputes as to the interpretation of that treaty, different considerations may well9. In the light of these preliminary considerations it may now be desirable to consider in detail the issues involved in a proposal to negotiate a separate general Arbitration Treaty in respect of one Member of the Commonwealth. In this connection reference may be made to the memorandum dated the 2nd November, 1926,-circulated by the Irish Free State Delegation at the Imperial Conference, on the subject of &quot; Existing Anomalies in the British Commonwealth of Nations&quot; in which the following principle is laid down : &quot; If the British Commonwealth of Nations is to endure as the greatest factor for the establishment of peace and prosperity throughout the world, its cohesive force must be real and permanent, whether viewed from within or without.....   The King is the real bond, and forms used in internationaltreaties will be devoid of all meaning so long as they do not give complete expression to that reality.&quot;But the cohesive force, resulting from the bond of the Crown, and its effectiveness as a means of preserving peace and prosperity, would surely be seriously impaired if
His Majesty&apos;s general arbitral obligations designed to be an alternative to war were different in respect of different parts of his dominions. At a time of grave inter-national crisis, the. effectiveness of the action of the British Commonwealth in performing its highest function of serving&apos; the cause of humanity by all its members acting together for the preservation of peace and civilisation,&quot; might be seriously hampered if one of His Majesty&apos;s Governments were committed to engagements in the matter of general arbitration which were not shared by His Majesty&apos;s other Governments.10. In accordance with the principle described in the Irish Free State memorandum above quoted, the Treaty for the Renunciation of War has just been ratified in the name of the King on behalf of all parts of the Empire, by joint and simultaneous action, and, as a corollary, it would appear to follow that the arbitral machinery which is intended to provide an effective substitute for war should equally be a matter for joint action. Indeed, the special relationship in which the different parts of the Commonwealth stand to one another really involves this result. If the general arbitral arrangements of the several Members of the Commonwealth in relation to any given country differ, either in extent or in character, how can the general principles of co-operation and consultation with a view to the pursuance of a common policy referred to in paragraph 7 remain possible of fulfilment 1 Moreover, in practice, it will seldom happen that an important matter which is to be dealt with under a general arbitration treaty concerns the interest of one part of the Common-wealth alone. Consequently, a most difficult situation would arise if a serious dispute took place with a foreign country affecting two or more members of the British Commonwealth, one alone of which had a general arbitration treaty with the country in question covering the subject of dispute. To take a concrete instance, suppose that a dispute arose with regard to the right to exclude certain classes of immigrants, and that of the parts of the Empire affected, one had a general arbitration treaty with the country concerned without any reservation to cover such a case and another had not. The latter would find itself in a position of great difficulty in resisting a demand that it too should submit to arbitration a question which might be regarded by public opinion in that part of the Empire as a matter of life and death importance; and even if it successfully resisted the demand it is obvious that its interests would be directly affected by the result of the arbitration which the other part of the Empire had no option but to accept.11. The same argument may be illustrated by reference to the obligations which the British Commonwealth has undertaken under the Covenant of the League of Nations. Take the case of a dispute likely to lead to a rupture of friendly relations breaking out between a Member of the League not forming part of the British Empire on the one side and, on the other, two or more parts of the Empire, one of which alone had entered into an &quot; all in&quot;&apos; arbitration treaty with the country in question. Under Article 12 of the Covenant, such a dispute must be submitted either to arbitration or to the Council. In such a case it is obvious that the consequences might be very serious, since a situation might arise in which the part of the Empire which had entered into an &quot;all in&quot; arbitration treaty would be bound to arbitrate if the other party insisted, whereas the other part or parts of the Empire might strongly prefer reference to the Council.12. It would be possible to elaborate this despatch, but His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment in the United Kingdom feel that the arguments above adduced are of such weight that they are bound to impress most strongly upon His Majesty&apos;s Government in the Irish Free State the desirability of preserving the present practice in this most important matter. In their view, if any suggestion is made for a change, such a suggestion should be a matter for consultation with all His Majesty&apos;s Governments at a meeting of the Imperial Conference, when the subject in all its bearings could be discussed.13. Copies of your despatch of the 31st January and of this reply are being sent to His Majesty&apos;s Governments in Canada, the Commonwealth of Australia, New Zealand, the Union of South Africa and Newfoundland.I have, &amp;c.

oDespatch from Irish Free State Government.(Despatch No. 88.)(Confidential.) Department of External Affairs,Sir, Irish Free State, March16, 1929.HIS Majesty&apos;s Government in the Irish Free State have had under consideration the proposals for an Arbitration Treaty with the Government of the United States.2. I have the honour to refer to your confidential despatch of the 3rd day of May, 1928, and to the assurance therein expressed that there should be no difficulty in meeting the points raised by His Majesty&apos;s Government in the Irish Free State in connection with the proposals then under consideration for an extension of the Arbitration Convention of 1908 between the late United Kingdom and the United States.3. The points raised by His Majesty&apos;s Government in the Irish Free State in that connection were stated in my despatch dated the 3rd day of November, 1927. In that despatch reference was made to the stipulation contained in Article 2 of the Convention of 1908, and to the fact that the Dominions as formerly constituted were in no sense parties to that Convention. The opinion of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the Irish Free State was stated to be that each member State of the Common-wealth should make its own separate arbitration conventions with the United States, and it was added that His Majesty&apos;s Government in the Irish Free State were accordingly examining the desirability of concluding an arbitration agreement with the United States at an early date so as to avoid any break in the continuity of the then existing agreement.4. Consideration of the present proposal for a new arbitration treaty as distinct from and in lieu of a renewal of the Convention of 1908 confirms His Majesty&apos;s Government in the Irish Free State in the views expressed in my despatch of the 3rd day of November, 1927. The now contemplated departure from the periodical renewal of the periodically lapsing Convention of 1908 and the substitu-tion therefor of a new arbitration agreement would appear to mark a juncture at which correctness of procedure and practical convenience combine to make the con-clusion of separate agreements between the member States of the Commonwealth and the Government of the United States peculiarly appropriate to the existing circumstances, and especially proportioned to the attainment of the objects prospectively in mind. It is felt that any difficulties which might have disclosed themselves in regard to the form of a renewal by the Commonwealth States of a con-vention originally concluded in virtue of a former constitutional relationship by one of their number on behalf and in the name of them all could not arise in connection with the conclusion of new arbitration conventions and the separate exercise in that behalf by each of those States of their individual treaty-making power. The various arbitration treaties would adhere in essentials to the same form, and, while such an arrangement would emphasise the Commonwealth polity, it would, at the same time, remove that prospect of confusion and doubt as to the incidence of rights and obligations which a general treaty would inevitably reveal. His Majesty&apos;s Government in the Irish Free State do not anticipate any dispute between the United States and any member State of the Commonwealth which could not best be settled direct between the United States and the particular member State concerned. Direct communication and discussion would, in specific instances, facilitate the settlement of the reference to the arbitral tribunal of the question falling to be ruled, and, in general, the separate treaty arrangement would simplify and expedite the processes of the entire arbitration proceeding.5. His Majesty&apos;s Government in the Irish Free State will hope to be assured that His Majesty&apos;s Government in Great Britain find themselves in agreement with the foregoing views and with the proposal of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the Irish Free State to conclude a separate arbitration treaty with the Government of the United States of America.I have, &amp;c. (Signed) P. McGILLIGAN,Minister for External Affairs.The Right honourable the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs. Downing Street, London, S.W. 1.
