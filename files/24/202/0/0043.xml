[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.   March 1929.SECRET. Copy No.   28CP. 93 (29).CABINET.RATIFICATION OF PROTOCOL FOR PROHIBITION OF USE OFPOISONOUS GASES.Memorandum by the Secretary oe State for Air.I CIRCULATE herewith for the information of my colleagues a note by the Chief of the Air Staff on the question of the ratification of the Protocol for the prohibition of the use of poisonous gases.For the reasons advanced in this note, I think the time has come when we should consider whether it would not now be safe for us to ratify, subject to the reservations with which other Powers have accompanied their ratifications.S. H.March 25, 1929.Note by the Chief of the Air Staff. Ratification of Protocol for Prohibition of Use of Poisonous Gases. Secretary of State,1. I think that the question of the ratification of this Protocol by His Majesty&apos;s Government should be further considered. When the question was last considered by the Committee of Imperial Defence and by the Cabinet in 1926, it was decided to defer ratification for the reasons (a) that very few other countries had ratified they being France, Venezuela and Liberia; and (6) that the General Staff considered that the question of the inhumanity of gas as compared with other methods of warfare merited further consideration.2. The position has now been considerably changed as regards (a). In the last few months Soviet Russia, Italy, Austria, Belgium, Egypt and Poland have ratified the Protocol. If we continue to withhold ratification, we lay ourselves open to the reproach, however unjustifiable in fact, that we are refusing to ban the use of poisonous gases. We signed and ratified Washington Treaty No. 2 of the 6th February, 1922, Article V of which prohibited the use of &quot; asphyxiating, poisonous and other gases,&quot; &amp;c, &amp;c. That Treaty did not come into force because France, for other reasons (i.e., objection to the articles of the Treaty dealing with submarine warfare), did not ratify it, but our own ratification of that Treaty makes more marked our continued abstention from ratification of the Geneva Protocol.3.   As regards the doubts expressed by the War Office, I would point out (i.) That most of the Governments which have ratified, including France and Russia, have done so subject to the following reservations : (a.) The Government is only bound by the Protocol vis-a-vis those other States which have signed and ratified the Protocol or adhered thereto;(b.) The Government ceases to be bound by the Protocol vis-a-vis any enemy State whose armed forces or whose allies do not respect the Protocol.[19036]
(ii.) Our own ratification, with these reservations, leaved us free to continue any necessary preparation of defensive and offensive measures against gas attack.(iii.) So long as we do not ratify we give an enemy some excuse for using gas against us.(iv.) Whatever the comparative inhumanity of gas, as compared with other methods of warfare, it is unlikely that this country would initiate the use of gas in war.(v.) Lastly and chiefly, from the air point of view, any measure is to be supported which reduces the risk of gas attack from the air launched not primarily against troops who can be trained in anti-gas measures and supplied with protective equipment, but against the civil population of our great towns. The consequent risk of dislocation of vital services and of collapse of moral would, I believe, far outweigh any possible advantage to ourselves in other directions which might be secured by retaining freedom of action.H. TRENCHARD,Chief of the Air Staff.March 25,1929.
