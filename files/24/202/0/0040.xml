(This Document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&quot;&apos;^- Gover:S iiE G R ST.0.P..90  (29)C A B . I N .E T.THE SALE AND SUPPLY OF INTOXICATING LIQUOR.MEMORANDUM BY THE HOME SECRETARY.I have no wish in bringing this question once again to the notice of my colleagues,  to ask them to take a decision on my suggestion that the whole field of licensing legislation should be reviewed by a Royal Commission (CP. 253  (2?) and Cabinet 53  (27), Conclusion 4), but I think it only right,  in order that the Cabinet may be in a position to appreciate the difficulties and. complexities of the present situation, to supplement the Report I made in C.P. 99  (26) of Deputations from the Temperance Interests and from the Clubs, by the views expressed to me at three more recent deputations representative of &quot;business men&quot;,  the brewers and licensed victuallers, and a, number of  important Benches of Licensing Justices.    I should perhaps explain that the &quot;business men&quot; deputation was organised by the National Commercial Temperance League.The personnel of the Deputations  (see Appendix) is interesting as indicating the importance to be attached to theirseveral representations.   The &quot;business men&quot; Deputation submitted to me in advance a memorial of the matters to which they desired to draw attention,  signed by some 800 persons.    The list in the Appendix is a selection from the signatories.The most convenient method of presenting the opinions expressed is to deal seriatim with the matters touched on by the deputations.opposed the proposals in the Bill introduced by Colonel Gretton on March 20th,  1928,  to fix the closing hours in the districts of the Metropolitan Police and the City Police at 11;    in Cities, County Boroughs, Towns and populous places at 10.30 p.m., and1.Evening Closing Hours.   TheI!business men&quot;  strongly
- 2 -elsewhere at 10 p.m.    They pointed out that the power to extend the evening hour to 10.50 under the Licensing Act of 1921, has only been taken advantage of by four County Boroughs out of 84, by 13 Municipal Boroughs out of the 169 that have separate Licensing Benches, and by 11 County Petty Sessional Divisions out of 730.    They had formed the estimate that 95^ of the people of England and Wales are living in areas where the week night closing is 10 p.m., where the hour is 10.30 p.m.,  and abouthfc where the hour is 11 p.m.    They were also of opinion that any extension of hours would lead to an increased consumption of intoxicants and an increased drink expenditure which the country could not at present afford,  and they pointed in this connexion to a decline over a period of years in the per capita consumption of alcoholic liquor and in the total annual drink bill of the country.The Licensing Justices did not raise this question and the representatives of the brewers and Licensed victuallers only touched on it incidentally.    They cited as a particular cause of grievance that while the hours during which it was permissible to supply alcoholic liquor now totalled only eight or nine,  the duties payable by licensed victuallers were often larger than those which they had been required to pay during the years before the War when they had eighteen hours in which to carry on their trade.2*    Sale of half-bottles of Spirits.    The &quot;business men&quot; were strongly opposed to the granting of the concession foreshadowed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in Committee on the Finance Bills of 1927 and 1928 on the grounds that it would be subversive of the efforts of Licensing Justices to control the sale of spirits and that spirit drinking which the concession would encourage, was a potent factor in the production of drunkenness and social disorder.    The Deputation from the    Licensing Justices took much the same stand.    They called attention to the rapid increase in the number of off--licensees who were not under any
obligation to obtain a Justices licence -. the number of such in England and Wales had grown from 731 in 1918 to 1339 in 1921 -and they thought that the rate of increase would be greatly accelerated if sale of half bottles were made legal.I should add here that I asked the Licensing Justices to consider and inform me later whether they would take exception to the granting of the half-bottle concession to those only who held Justioe&apos;s licences, but I gathered that their view was that they would accept this  plan.3.    &quot;Off&quot; Licences and Justice &apos;s Licences,.    At present, under Section 111 of the Licensing Act, 1910, Excise off-licences can be obtained without the licensee obtaining a Justice&apos;s licence, provided that he sells only spirits and other liquids and that his premises do not communicate with premises carrying on some other business.    The Licensing Justices urged that the provision should be abolished and that these premises should be brought under the control of the Justices.&quot;Clubs&quot;..    The &quot;business men&quot; urged that Licensing Justices should be given adequate control of Clubs on the ground that in many cases the work of the magistrates in scheduling redundant licences for consideration by the Compensation Authority had been undone by the subsequent opening of Clubs.    In thie they were supported by the Licensing Justices who drew attention to the increase of registered Clubs from 7932 in 1918 to 12481 in 1927. The Chairman of the Hull Licensing Justices said that during recent years the Trade had paid in compensation for the extinction of 107 redundant licences  160,000:    during the same period 108 Clubs had opened.    In addition to the other objections commonly raised - that the Police have no right of inspection and that the Clubs pay no licence duty - the opening of Clubs is said to constrain Justices to grant licences which they would have preferred,  in the interests of the locality,  to withhold. Applications are made in expanding areas for licences and if, for reasons which appear sufficient to the Justices,  such applications
are refused, refusal may be followed by the opening of Clubs. The Licensing Justices,  in order that the supply and sale of intoxicating liquor may be subjected to proper supervision, have, thus felt impelled to grant the licences.Both the business men and the Licensing Justices have formulated proposals to give effect to their  views, ?/hich are, in substance,  identical1.    That registered Clubs should be licensed by the sameauthority that controls licences for the sale of intoxicatingliquor.2.    That registered Clubs should be liable to inspection by Police Officers not under the rank of Inspector.3. . That the permitted hours for the sale of intoxicating liquor in Clubs should be the same as those fixed for licensed premises in the same area, with power for the Licensing Authority to vary the hours in special cases.4.    That premises in respect of which a Justices Licence has been forfeited,  or the renewal of a- Justices Licence refused,  should not be occupied by a Club for the sale of intoxicating liquor for five years from the closure of the premises.On the subject of Clubs,  the representatives of the Brewers and Licensed Victuallers found themselves in a somewhat difficult position since,  though the interest    of Clubs and of retailers as such are wholly opposed,  there is some community of interest between clubs and the wholesalers.    In general their view   was that to acquiesce in the growth of Clubs at the expense of licensed houses was a mistaken policy and that it would be wiser to foster the growth of licensed houses which were subject to Police supervision and, now that the Brewers were well organised, to stricter control by the Trade itself.    They appreciated that Clubs had peculiar needs and regretted that  the Government&apos;s attitude to Captain Bourne&apos;s contemplated Bill which embodied a oompromise (which they said was satisfactory) between the Trade
I did not discuss with the Deputations the merits of their proposals all of which had previously in some form or another come before me,  nor do I intend to do so in this memorandum. The general line of my replies has been that the suggestions made would require legislation,  that there is no prospect of amending legislation on so controversial a subject during the lifetime of the present Parliament, and that I would bring the representations made to me to the notice of the Cabinet. I  should add that I told the &quot;business men&apos;1  Deputation that and the Conservative Clubs and the Clubs for which Mr, B.T.. Hall speaks, had not been encouraging.5.    The Bona Fide Traveller.    The representatives of the Licensed Victuallers and the Trade complained that the absence of facilities for serving the bona fide traveller during non-permitted hours was a real grievance, particularly in the small county districts where the curtailment of hours without any accompanying reduction in the licence duty had inflicted great hardship.    They asserted that publicans all over the country would readily - indeed with enthusiasm -- accept the duty of keeping their houses open at all times or opening when required for the service of the bona fide traveller.    It was commonly objected that if the privilege accorded to the bona fide traveller before the war were  restored, the benefits.of the break in the day would,  in London,  be wholly lost and they suggested that this objection might be met by making the area within, say,  a four-mile radius of Charing Cross, a non-privileged area.6.    Sunday Closing in Monmouthshire.    The Deputation from the Trade resented the injustice under which their members in Monmouthshire were labouring.    Licensed &quot;Victuallers in that County were compelled to close on Sundays, while Clubs were free to remain open.
