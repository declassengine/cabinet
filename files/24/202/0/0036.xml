PRICE S      OF      PETROLEUM      PRODUCTS.18th March, 1929.1*    This statement is made by the Anglo-American Oil Company Limited, by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, Limited, and by Shell-Mex Limited, the three Companies furnishing to the consumer of petroleum products a complete supply service In every part of the British Isles.It Is made In response to His Majesty&apos;s Government1s invitation to these Companies (as announced by the Prime Minister in the House of Commons on 7th March, 1929) to explain the reason for the Increases as from 1st March, 1929 of 2-^d and Igd per gallon in the price of motor-spirit and of kerosene respectively.2,    Despite the increase in question, the retail price of motor-spirit in London today, after allowing for Duty, is lower, and for the most part very much lower, than at any time during the last ten years - except for the twenty-three months April 1927 to February 1929 (See AMLEX C). That period of almost two.years represented a temporary and artificial phrase,  a brief description of which will demonstrate the reason for the recent increase in price.3.    For many months consumers of motor-spirit and kerosene In this country have paid prices which are not &quot;world-prices&quot; - a term of which the full significance is later explained (See paragraph 4 et seq).What Is kno n as  &quot;dumping&quot; is a familiar feature of trade in the case of many commodities, i.e. the importation
411-*during a period, of supplies produced under artificial or purely temporary economic conditions, at prices below those at which the permanent supplier can regularly import. Importations of this kind can be sufficient in quantity to affect very materially the operations of responsible importers who year in and year out provide for the permanent continuous supply of the requirements of the nation.    But in the United Kingdom, after the end of 1927,  there developed a situation far more severe than any mere &quot;dumping&quot; however aggravated could have caused.    Supplies  controlled by the Union of Soviet Republics,  and available to it under condi-tions bearing no relation to those of any other traders throughout the world, have been sold in the United Kingdom by the organisation of the Soviet Republics at prices not only below, but definitely far below the level of world-values.    The three Companies were compelled either to meet this situation, or to withdraw, partly or to a great extent, from the trade.    In the nature of things,  this state of affairs could not continue Indefinitely; but it was not until the end of February 1929 that arrangements were reached which terminated the &quot;price-war&quot; that had existed in this country for almost two years, thereby permitting a return towards -that world-level of pric es which in the long run is essential to the maintenance of supplies for the British Market.PETROLEUM A WORLD COMMODITY. 4.    Great Britain&apos;s annual consumption of motor-spirit amounts to more than 2-g- million tons; but that of the whole world is about fifty million tons.   Home sources of production contribute only a small part of Britain&apos;s supplies.  (Annex A).
Motor-spirit is one of the products obtained, by distilla-tion, manufacture and treatment, from natural petroleum (called &quot;crude&quot;), virtually none of which in its original form can be used industrially or domestically.    The term &quot;crude&quot; therefore, signifies the raw material in the form in which it is originally found in underground deposits and raised by means of wells to the earth&apos;s surface.    From that &quot;raw material&quot; motor-spirit is obtained - as one of a number of products,. none of which can be obtained without involving the manufacture of others.In addition to motor-spirit, the other products derived from &quot;crude&quot; include kerosene (&quot;paraffin&quot;), lubricating oil, paraffin wax, fuel oil,  asphalt, et cetera, for all of which a market must be found if motor-spirit is to be produced.    Of the total quantity of &quot;crude&quot; won from the earth, the quantity of motor-spirit derived (taking a world average)  is about two-sevenths.    The remainder yields a widely varying range of products, regulated in quantity and quality by the particular nature of the &quot;crude&quot;.5.  In 1928, &quot;crude&quot; raised from natural deposits, and that by over four thousand different producers throughout the world, totalled more than 180 million tons.    Of that quantity the United States produced more than 120 million tons.    The United States,  Mexico, the West  Indies,  and the Northern States of South America, together produced over 150 million tons, or in excess of four-fifths of the world-total.The Gulf of Mexico may therefore be said to constitute the &quot;centre of gravity&quot; of the world&apos;s petroleum trade i and in consequence the prices ruling there represent the basis of world-values for petroleum products.
6. Groat Britain&apos;s importation of all petroleum products does not exceed 4 per cent, of the world1s total consumption, and therefore the extent of her imports is not such as to exercise by itself any powerful influence upon the value of world supplies.MARKETERS,  and MAttKEIING FUNCTIONS IN IHB UNITED KINGDOM.7. The following is a description of the organisation of the three Companies responsible for satisfying more than three-quarters of this country&apos;s petroleum requirements.8.  (a) The Anglo-American Oil Company is a marketing company established in the early days of the petroleum industry It has created, and it maintains, a comprehensive organisation for the sale of all petroleum products demanded by British consumers.(b) The Anglo-Persian Oil Company annually produces, from Persia, more than 5 million tons of &quot;crude&quot; petroleum, i.e. about &quot;&amp;% of the world&apos;s total.    That production is sold partly in the United Kingdom and  in certain other European countries, and partly in markets of the Eastern Hemisphere nearer to Persia,   For purposes of distribution and sale in England and&apos;wales, it operates through its subsidiary the British Petroleum Company, Limited.(c) Shell-Mex Limited constitutes the &quot;Royal-Dutch-Shell&apos;r group1s organisation responsible for sales in the United Kingdom.   That group - the &quot;Royal-Dutch-Shell&quot; - is interested in the production and marketing of petroleum produots inmany parts of the world.
Of the business of the entire &quot;Royal-Dutch-Shell&apos;! group not more than 6 per cent is done in Great Britain.9. It is    a decided advantage for Great Britain, an importer, to keep her markets open to receive supplies from all world-sources rather than to rely on any single source of supply the duty of Great Britain&apos;s importing and marketing organisations is to secure and safeguard supplies, by methods related not to one but to all suitable sources of supply; and, within the country, to develop the highest attainable degree of efficiency as petroleum distributors.     Only thus can the interests of the British consumer best be served.The appended Table  (Annex A) shows the countries of origin of Great Britain&apos;s motor-spirit supplies.      It will be seen that many countries contribute.10.   There is no theoretical or practical obstacle closing the British market to any organisation willing to rival and excel the three Companies in quality, in service or in price -in all or any of the territory over which the three Companies offer uniform service.     Neither by national sentiment, by national interest, nor by Act of Parliament, is the British market induced to favour any single source of supply or method of service.11.    It is only as a result of their highly organised service In providing throughout all parts of the co\uitry - Find in abnormal as well as In normal times - abundant facilities and consistent quality of motor-spirit at reasonable prices, that the three Companies have become the suppliers of the great mass of consumers in this country.s
BASIS    OF   PaiOE.12. Over a considerable period, the price-basis at an importing market of any size necessarily conforms to that of its largest supply market.    Prom Annex A it will be seen that 70fo of Great Britain&apos;a motor-spirit requirements is drawn from the United States, Mexico and the northern part of South America - three countries which constitute the nearest large source of supply.    Consequently,  the price ruling in the Gulf of iiexico, - i.e. the &quot;U.S. Gulf&quot; - which governs all these markets - is the price which in normal circumstances must dominate the price ruling in Great Britain.Motor spirit.13.    The &quot;U.S.Gulf&quot; export market caters for many varying requirements of quality.    It is therefore necessary to arrive at some standard of comparative values, as amon^r the grades regularly &quot;quoted&quot; in that market and those required by the British consumer.14. A standard of general comparison is afforded by the particular quality specified by the United States Government, and now known throughout the markets of the world as &quot;U.S. Hew Navy   Gasolene&quot;.    Further, &quot;U.S. New Navy&quot; grade approximates very closely,  in quality,  to that which is in greatest demand throughout the American Continent.15. The qualities sold in Great Britain as &quot;Commercial&quot; (or &quot;No.3&quot;) grades are superior to &quot;U.S. Hew Navy&quot; gasolene; and in value they are comparable with the grade, designated &quot;60/61 Beaume&quot;, of which the &quot;U.S. Gulf&quot; export quotations are set out in Annex S.
16.    Annex E is a table of &quot;U.S.Gulf&quot; export prices - 1032 to 1929, made up from prices published officially, and for purposes of brevity confined to prices of business done in the first -//eek of each of the months shown.    As will be seen, for all grades of motor-spirit, world-prices as reflected in &quot;U.S. Gulf&quot; export prices rose steadily during the greater part of 1&apos;-28, and to-day stand substantially higher than at the end of 1927.    The following prices (in cents per American gallon) are extracted from Annex E: -&quot;64/66 Beaume&quot;      &quot;60/62 Beaume&quot;    &quot;U. S..New Navy&quot;Date. Spirit. Spiri t. Gasolene.December, 1927 8 7% 7kay, 1928  .... 95/s 87/a 84March, 1929... 10 9^ 8417.    The current &quot;U.S. Gulf&quot; export value of &quot;60/62 Beaume&quot; Spirit is 94 cents per American gallon.      An American gallon is equal to .833, or approximately five-sixths, of an Imperial Gallon.      Calculated to the nearest farthing the equivalent of 9% cents per American gallon is 5fd. per Imperial gallon.     From this point,  the following t3.ble gives current costs np to the point of delivery by the importer and distributor to the retail dealer or the commercial consumer, - each item calculated to the nearest farthing:-

Since approximately only 20$ of total UnitedKingdom deliveries are now made in packages, i-e, in cans or barrels, the foregoing costs are those for &quot;bulk&quot;  (i.e,  non-packed) delivery,18.      The three Companies are, of course, &quot;wholesalers&quot;, not &quot;retailers&quot;.    It is estimated that less than half their motor-spirit sales are made to dealers for re-sale at the retail price; the remainder comprises sales to commercial consumers.The &quot;price realised&quot; (as recently increased) by the three Companies for Commercial spirit supplied to dealers in &quot;bulk&quot;, i.e. not supplied in cans, is arrived at as
follows in &quot;London Zone&quot; (i.e. including an area of approxi-mately 60 miles in the EnglishProvinces.radius round London)Retail price (Commercial quality) paid by private motorist - March 1929...1/5 1/21/51Dealer&apos;s margin00     06000*000     JoOdOPrice realised by the Companies1/24The average gross price realised for all  sales is less than those just given, because allowance must be made for the rebates made to large  commercial users who take their supplies direct from the &quot;Wholesaler&quot;.   These rebates vary according to consumption.    In the aggregate, the price received by the Companies falls below the retail or private motorists&apos; &quot;pump&quot; price by approximately 3-id per gallon.   The average price realised by the Companies, therefore, is not l/2 and l/2-g, but l/5 and 1/5^- less 3-ld, in each case, - i,e. l/l-gd in the &quot;London Zone&quot; and l/2d in the English provinces respectively; as against a &quot;Total Cost&quot;, brought out in the preceding paragraph, of l/2d per gallon.19.    As will be seen, these calculations relate to &quot;Commercial&quot; Spirit, which constitutes the major portion of the trade.    But most privato car owners use &quot;First-quality&quot; motor-spirit.    This grade therefore, is universally stocked at garages throughout the country, and car-owners thus enjoy a complete service in almost every village, however remote. For this service a special system of detailed distribution must be maintained; and, as a result, the first-grade &quot;cost of distribution&quot; is appreciably higher than that of &quot;Commercial&quot; spirit.These figures include a rebate of -/id. per gallon payable to Dealers who satisfy certain conditions.    To-day, these conditions are satisfied by almost all Dealers with whom the three groups do business.The Dealer1s margin of 3d. represents his &quot;gross income&quot;, not     &apos; profit&quot;.      Out of it&apos; he pays his expenses.
Furthermore, some explanation is necessary as to the distinctive quality of the respective First-grade brands sold by the three Companies, for which a higher price is realised than for Commercial grades.Among the factors of which, in its  development, Britain&apos;s Motor Car manufacturing industry has taken particular account are (1) the excellence of British roads, and (2) the influence upon Motor Car design, of the special formula adopted by Parliament for calculating the Motor-Car tax.    That industry has therefore been characterised by special attention to the perfection (naturally resulting in the popular use) of Motor-cars having high-compression engines of small dimensions, but of high effective power and of economy in fuel consumption.Their perfection and popular use could never have been attained but for the evolution of the particular quality of motor-spirit best calculated to produce, from such a type of engine, the maximum degree of effective power and the minimum of fuel consumption.In order to secure and ensure sufficient supplies of first-quality products, the Companies have not restricted themselves to any single source of supply.      In the result, their first-quality spirits  (some brought from remote sources of supply) although differing in some respects one from another, are each the result of many years&apos; scientific research;    and they afford the finest attainable complement of the high-efficiency motor-engines produced by the British manufacturer.18.3.29.
fi- t: 0 .e &apos;j iiAlthough, not unnaturally, the price of first-quality (so-called &quot; No. l&quot; ) Spirit &quot;is- commonly adopted as the subject of analysis and criticism, no such analysis or criticism is valid unless full account he taken of these&apos;special characteristics of quality and of value.    In short, first-quality spirit is a commodity produced to meet a special re quireme nt.Since it represents a blend of various spirits, no direct comparison can be made with &quot;U.S .Gulf&quot; prices.Kerosene.20.    On 1st March, 1929- the wholesale price of Kerosene, marketed in the United Kingdom by the three Companies, was raised l-Ad ^er gallon.    Much of the foregoing argument applies mutatis mutandis to Kerosene with no less force than to motor-spirit.    Schedules are annexed showing(a) &quot;U.S.Gulf&quot; export quotations for two qualities ofKerosene from 1922 to date    -   Annex P,   and(b) a Table of U.K. wholesale selling prices forKerosene from 1914 to 1929    -   Annex D. Retail prices of Kerosene are in no sense dictated by the three Companies, nor do the Companies fix or maintain the &quot;Dealer1s margin&quot;.    Wholesale prices,  as increased on 1st March, 1929, can be built up on t!U.S. Gulf&apos;! prices in the same manner as that adopted for motor-spirit.    The calculation is as follows:-
Kerosene.Pence per Imperial Galion.COST PRIOR TO ARRIVAL IN U.E. -The &quot;U.S.Gulf&quot; Export price (March 1929) for Kerosene of the quality in most common use in GreatBritain......... 6-fc per American Gallon or     4Cost of Ocean transport (Gu?f to U.K. ), Oceaninsurance and leakage......      ...... f-       4-fCHARGES  IN U.K.Dues: coastwise and rail freights.

As will be observed, the rate of increase of 1926/27, i.e, 12.6^ has been reproducsd in 1927/28.    while  in 1920 the total trade was 587,000 tons, by 1928 it had expanded to a figure of 2,776,000 tons - an increase of 37 3)&apos;.-. As will be observed from the same appendix, the current retail price,  in London, of First-Quality and Commercial Spirits,  (including the existing duty of 4d. per gallon, which exceeds the 1914 duty by Id.) is two-pence per gallon below that of 1914.    This is due to various causes, one of which is a large reduction effected by the Companies in the  cost of distribution    - a reduction facilitatec by expansion in the volume of consumption.
22.   Although distributing companies in Britain as in every other country are dependent on world-supplies, obtain in-able at world-prices, the result of that dependence has in no way affected the British consumer unjustly.   As part of their normal procedure, the three Companies do their best to foresee the trend of world-prices and to make advance arrangements to secure ample supplies - and at reasonable stable prices which will be influenced only to an equitable degree by changes in world prices.ANGLO-AMERICAN OIL COMPANY, Limited.ANGLO-PERSIAN OIL COMPANY, Limited.SHELL-MEX, Limited.(Sad.)
