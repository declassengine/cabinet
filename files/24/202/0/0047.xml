November 1926.SECRET.Copy No.3COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL  DEFENCE.Extract from the Minutes of the 217th Meeting, held on November 11, 1926.***(3.)-RATIFICATION OF THE, GENEVA GAS PROTOCOL  (CHEMICAL(Previous Reference: C.I.D. Minutes of 215th Meeting, Minute 1.)THE COMMITTEE had under consideration the question of the ratification of the Geneva Gas Protocol (Chemical Warfare Policy) (C.I.D. Papers Nos. 535-B, 706-B, 708-B, 709-B, 723-B, 725-B, 726-B and 732-B).SIR LAMING WORTHINGTON-EVANS stated that before 1914 the use of gas was prohibited by The Hague Convention of 1907. The Germans were the first to use gas during the war, and the Allies then retaliated. In the Treaty of Versailles the use of gas was denounced and Germany was prohibited from the manufacture of poisonous gases. At the Washington Treaty a Declaration was made against the use of gas, which had been signed by the British Empire, and in 1925 the Geneva Protocol was drawn up, denouncing the use of gas also. Both the Washington Con-vention and the Geneva Protocol had not. yet been ratified.The General Staff had come to the conclusion that (a.) Gas was an effective and practical weapon of war by no means less humane than other recognised weapons, but rather the reverse, as the following-statistics show : The percentage of fatal cases among British gas casualties in the last war was 3-3 per cent., as against 37 per cent., which represents the percentage of total fatal casualties due to other weapons.(b.) The British Empire was in a favourable situation for producing, using and protecting itself against gas.(c.) There could be no effective guarantee that an unscrupulous signatory of a Gas Convention would abide by it, and war gases lent themselves particularly to secret and rapid production as bi-products of perfectly legitimate commercial chemistry.(d.) The logical sequel of an international prohibition of gas was a demand for an international exchange of information as regards the methods of defence against gas, whereby we should be called upon to disclose the results of all our Chemical Warfare Research work without any guarantee of a similarly frank disclosure by other Powers.In this connection he drew attention to a quotation from Lord Grey&apos;s book, -&apos;&apos; Twenty-five Years &quot; :-&quot; One lesson from the experience of the war is that we should not bind ourselves to observe any rules of war unless those who sign them with us under -take to uphold them by force, if need be, against an enemy who breaks them.  WeWARFARE POLICY).(C.I.D. Papers Nos. 535-B, 706-B, 708-B, 709-B, 723-B, 725-B, 726-Band 732-B.)[15344-3]
kept the rule against the use of poison gas till the Germans broke it, and when they did break it we had neither gas nor protection against gas ready. The rule was nothing but a disadvantage to us, for its violation by the Germans brought no help to us. To bind ourselves by rules which we intend to keep and others intend to break is unreasonable, so long as those who break them can do it with impunity.&quot;Having regard to these considerations, he hoped that the Empire would not bind itself any further than was already the case to the prohibition of the use of gas in War. He realised that there was considerable diplomatic difficulty in this connec-tion, which no doubt would be expressed by the Foreign Secretary. Assuming, however, that we had made a mistake in the past by denouncing gas warfare, he suggested that it would be inadvisable to do anything which would perpetuate this mistake for all time. All the Powers were working at the present time on Research Work in connection with gases, and Russia had recently established a large factory for the production of mustard gas within reach of the Afghanistan border.Mr. BRIDGEMAN stated that the Admiralty supported the views of the General Staff on this subject.SIR HUGH TRENCHARD stated that, with the ever-increasing range of aircraft, and with developments in the methods of spraying gas from aeroplanes, densely-populated cities would be exposed to this form of attack, and the casualties among the civilian population would be very considerable. Any measures of prohibition-prohibition which could be relied upon should therefore be adopted. If, however, no faith could be reposed in International Agreements, then we should make sure of having at our disposal the means to use gas also.LORD BIRKENHEAD stated that India was seriously affected by this question of gas warfare. He quite agreed with the passage quoted by the Secretary of State for War from Lord Grey&apos;s book, but the case with which he was concerned was more serious. Lord Grey had suggested that we should abide by our agreements where other Powers would break theirs. In the case of India, however, our potential enemy was certain not to give any pledge to abstain from the use of gas, and was, in fact, equipping himself at the present time, so as to be able to make formidable concentrations of gas when required, as was shown by the Secretary of State for . War&apos;s reference to the Russian gas factory at Samara. Having regard to these preparations on the part of Russia, those responsible to Parliament for the defence of India must take measures to develop, adequate means of defence. India was threatened by an enemy with whom causes of quarrel already existed and who was actually plotting for our destruction at the present time In these circumstances, we would not be justified in doing anything which would deprive India of the chance of using gas in retaliation. At the present time anti-gas measures in India were almost non-existent. He had been into this question, and it was his intention to put clear proposals on the subject before the Committee of Imperial Defence at an early date. He was inclining towards the view that India must lean more on the assistance of aircraft to solve its defence problems, and the use of gas from aeroplanes was at once infinitely more effective and more humane than the employment of bombs.-At the present time, the frontier tribes were beginning to become accustomed to bomb attack and took shelter in caves as soon as aeroplanes came upon the scene. With the use of gas it would be possible to follow them into the caves, and it would not be necessary to adopt such measures as the destruction of villages and the burning of crops. It seemed to him that on every ground the use of gas was indispensable to the protection of India, and he submitted that any decision in regard to the prohibition of gas should not apply to India.SIR AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN said he felt bound to call attention to the various declarations which had been made in the past in regard to the use of poisonous gases, as set forth in a Memorandum prepared in the Foreign Office (C.I.D. Paper No. 732-B). We had repeatedly condemned gas in the strongest language. We had charged the use of gas against Germany as a barbarous act and as an outrage to civilisation. Now the Military Authorities had re-examined the matter and said that we had mistaken the character of gas warfare and that it was more humane than any other recognised method of warfare. This, however, depended upon the particular gases which were used, and there was nothing to show that the gases of the future would be as humane as those contemplated at the present time.   The
5i3treaties against gas, even if signed and ratified, were only binding in warfare against those nations who also signed and ratified the same treaty, and our obligation ceased immediately if they dishonoured their pledges. The conclusions he drew, therefore, did not indicate any difference in policy. He considered that it was as important now as in the past that the armed forces should study gas, and be prepared to produce it and to protect themselves against it. He suggested that we should not press other nations to ratify the Convention, and we should only ratify the Convention ourselves if and when we found that all the other Powers had also ratified. As Foreign Secretary he must deprecate the launching of any campaign in favour of gas till a longer time had elapsed and our charges against Germany were less present in the minds of the public.LORD BIRKENHEAD stated that he understood from the Foreign Secretary&apos;s remarks that, if Russia did not sign the Convention, then we had a free hand to use gas against her. He added that the Chemical Warfare Committee have stated in a recent Report that it was reported from a reliable source that the Soviet Government were giving sympathetic consideration to the erection of a gas factory in Afghanistan.LORD CECIL said that at the first meeting of the Preparatory Commission the Belgian representative had made a most effective speech dealing with the devasta-ting effect of gas warfare on the civil population. The result was the adoption of a resolution that the question should be examined to determine how far the use of gas could be prohibited. A questionnaire was drawn up on the subject, the replies to which showed that there was no means of protection against the conversion of ordinary factories to the production of poisonous gases; which conversion could be easily effected and gas produced in large quantities in a matter of some 48 hours. Further, it was reported that there was no difficulty whatever in devising means for spraying gas from the air. Since no means of protection could be found in either of these directions, the Technical Committee was asked to report if any international sanction was possible which would prevent the use of gas in the future. To this the reply was given that the only means would be a special inter-national agreement to retaliate with gas on any country which made use of gas. The British and American representatives had declined to express an opinion on this subject on the grounds that it was a political and not a technical matter. The question, therefore, was bound to come up again, and he submitted that it was impossible, in view of public opinion, to adopt the attitude that the use of gas was a matter of indifference to us. He suggested that we had more to fear than other nations, even in India, from a formidable gas attack owing to the geographical position of our populous areas.Me. MACKENZIE KING considered that there was little value in self-denying ordinances unless we could ensure that all parties would agree to the ordinances and would carry out their agreements. He thought that in no circumstances ought we to deprive ourselves of the means of making use of gas should the necessity arise.Mr. BRUCE agreed to the policy advocated by the Foreign Secretary, since there was no possible way of limiting the production of gas. He thought, however, that there was no harm in pushing on with the Geneva Protocol notwithstanding that Russia would not be a party to the Convention. In the event of her using gas against us we should still be free to protect ourselves by employing it also, but she would be morally wrong in the eyes of the world. In regard to gas being more humane, he was unable to accept the suggestion, since there was no limit to the deadly properties of the gases which might be used in the future. Any idea of a campaign to educate public opinion in favour of chemical warfare, was, in his opinion, a proposal too wild to contemplate.Mr. COATES suggested that, provided we kept abreast of developments in the production of and defence against poisonous gases, there was no harm in becoming-parties to the Geneva Protocol and in doing everything possible to secure a complete and binding pledge from other nations not to make use of gas in warfare.GENERAL HERTZOG and Mr. MONROE said that they agreed with the proposal of the Foreign Secretary.
Conclusion.The Committee of Imperial Defence agreed to recommend : -That the policy in regard to the ratification of the Geneva Gas Protocol of 1925 should be as follows : &quot; To adopt a neutral attitude until other Powers have signified their intention, and to ratify only if other Powers do so.&quot;*2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1, November 11, 1926.
