Army and Air Force (Annual)Bill.NOTES  ON CLAUSES. Clause 4.The proviso added in 1922 to s. 76 of the Army Act provides that in the case of certain boys enlisted under 18 years of age the 12 years fixed by the section as the maximum term for an original enlistment shall be reckoned from the date of attaining 18 years.At the time of its introduction consequential aniend-ments were not made in some later sections which refer to the reckoning of time, or of service, for various pur-poses, and the present clause (read with the Second Schedule) is intended to supplement the proviso by defining clearly the date as from which, in the case of such a boy, time is to be calculated for the purposes of s. 78 (2) giving power to vary the conditions of service so as to permit a man in the reserve to re-enter upon army service;s. 79 reckoning of service towards discharge or transfer to reserve;s. 83 (1) fixing period after which a soldier en-listed for general service cannot be transferred without his consent to another corps;ss. 84 (1), 85 providing for re-engagement after nine years&apos; service to serve for twenty-one years in all and for continuance in service after twenty-one years&apos; service.The Army Council are advised that upon the true construction of the sections, without any amendment, the period of time or service should be reckoned (as under the proviso to s. 76) from the date on which the boy attains 18 years of age. The proposed amendments give effect to this construction except in the case of s. 83 (1). In the case of that section, as a boy may be appointed to a corps some months before attaining 18, it is proposed that the period after which he cannot be transferred compulsorily should begin to run as soon as he is so appointed.83-4 a
Clause 5.(a) The limit on the amount which may under s. 145 (2) of the Army Act be deducted from a soldier&apos;s pay and applied towards the support of his wife and children (legitimate or illegitimate) is at present fixed at a specific sum, viz., in the case of a warrant officer 4-s., in the case of a non-commissioned officer not below the rank of sergeant 3s. and in the case of any other soldier 2s. a day.In view of the fact that under modern conditions of service the pay of soldiers varies considerably, it is proposed by this clause to substitute a limit based upon a fixed proportion of the individuals pay. In the case of a private soldier drawing the lowest rate of pay, the amount deductible will be the same amount as in practice is now deducted; in the case of soldiers chawing higher normal rates or tradesmen&apos;s rates, the amount deductible will be increased.(6) Under s. 145 (3), when a maintenance summons or bastardy summons is issued against a soldier serving at a distance, the complainant must deposit with the commanding officer a sum sufficient to enable the soldier to attend the hearing; and, if an order is made against the soldier, it directs him to pay to the com-plainant as costs an amount equal to the sum so deposited.Under the subsection as it stands, the amount of such costs is paid to the complainant out of public funds and is then recovered from the soldier&apos;s pay by deduc-tions additional to those provided for by s. 145 (2).As the higher limits proposed for s. 145 (2) are based on the amount of pay which should, it is con-sidered, be left to a soldier for his military requirements, it is proposed that in future any amount so paid in respect of costs should be recovered from the deductions ordered to be made under s. 145 (2).Clause 6.The effect of this clause is to make in the Air Force Act similar amendments to those made by the Bill in the Army Act subject to any necessary modifications in phraseology.
The amendment in s. S3 of the Army Act is in-applicable to the Air Force Act because that Act con-tains no corresponding section. The amendment in s. 85 of the Army Act is inapplicable, because the words proposed to be inserted in it already appear in s. 85 of the Air Force Act.In the case of the Army, the proviso to s. 76 applies only to certain classes of boys; in the case of the Air Force, it applies to all boys.
