[This Docament is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;b Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.   March 1929.SECRET. Copy No.    28CP. 80 (29).CABINET.OIL POSITION IN IRAQ.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.IN response to the desire expressed by certain&apos; of my Colleagues at last Wednesday^ Cabinet meeting for more detailed information on the points dealt with in my memorandum of the 11th March (CP. 73 (29)) and the memorandum circulated by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (CP. 78 (29)), I now circulate, for the information of the Cabinet, a memorandum prepared in my Department summarising the correspondence and negotiations which have led up to the present situation between the Iraq Government and the Turkish Petroleum Company and to the dispute with the French Government. This memorandum has been cast in the form of a historical summary in order that my Colleagues may appreciate the chronological sequence of events and the various factors which from time to time have influenced the actions of the protagonists. I think that it will be found that this memorandum covers all the points upon which further information was asked for as recorded in the official extract of the conclusions of the meeting (Cabinet 11 (29)).   I will take the points mentioned in that document seriatim.(i.) Particulars of what the Turkish Petroleum Company have said or written to the Iraq Government in the matter of the proposed Baghdad-Haifa Railway are furnished at length in the memorandum. The Iraq Governments replies to the suggestions advanced from time to time by the Turkish Petroleum Company were usually delivered orally in discussions between representatives of that Government and the Company. The nature of those replies can be gauged from the telegraphic reports from the High Commissioner, which are summarised in the memorandum. The text of the draft agreement between the Iraq Government and the Turkish Petroleum Company, which was accepted by the latter&apos;s representative in September 1928, is annexed to the memorandum (Appendix (A)), as also are (a) the draft letter accompanying Sir John Cadman&apos;s letter to me of the 31st October, 1928 (Appendix (B)), and (b) the revised draft of that letter proposed in my letter to-Sir John Cadman of the 7th November, 1928, and accepted by him in his letter to me of the 8th November (Appendix (C)). The revised draft letter, together with the revised draft agreement to which it related, was formally submitted to the Iraq Government on the 9th November by the Company&apos;s representative in Iraq.(ii.) The question whether there would be any breach of international obligation if the Iraq Government were to impose the Haifa route as a condition for granting the Turkish Petroleum Company an extension of the period within which to select plots for development is dealt with in the enclosed memorandum. I am advised that the only instruments which would possibly be held to be infringed by such a. condition are Article 11 of the Anglo-Iraq Treaty of 1922 and Articles 10 and 11 of the San Remo Agreement between this country and France. As regards the former instrument, I should point out that criticism would be directed not towards the condition attaching to the extension, but towards the extension itself. As will be seen from paragraph 3 of the Memorandum, the Permanent Mandates Commis-sion, the body from whom criticism is most likely to come, have recently ruled that a much longer extension of time granted by the Iraq Government to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company was in full consonance with the stipulations of Article 11 of the Anglo-Iraq Treaty. . ..[19005] b
The effect of the San memo Agreement ^ is examined in paragraph 22 of the memorandum. I think that my Colleagues will agree with me that this instrument cannot be held to provide any juridical obstacle to the imposition of the condition in question.(iii.) The question whether the Iraq Government could be induced by His Majesty&apos;s Government to impose such a condition without involving any breach of our mandatory position in Iraq is not specifically dealt with in the enclosed memorandum. I am advised that it is very doubtful whether it would be possible to rely upon any of the instruments governing our relations with Iraq to justify such action on the part of His Majesty&apos;s Government. It is true that under Article 4 of the existing Treaty the Iraq Government are bound to accept our advice &quot;on all important matters affecting the international and financial obligations and interests of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.&quot; but this provision could scarcely be held to justify intervention with the Iraq Government to secure that the pipe-line to the Mediterranean had its outlet at a Palestine Port. Fortunately, there is no need for such intervention, since, for reasons other than those influencing the attitude of His Majesty&apos;s Government, the Iraq Government are most anxious to ensure that both the Trans-Desert Railway and the pipe-line do not pass through Syrian territory.(iv.) I do not think that anyone reading the enclosed memorandum could be left with the impression that His Majesty&apos;s Government had put any pressure upon the Iraq Government to cause them to insist on Haifa as a terminal port for the proposed Railway and pipe-line. It is clear that, so far from pressing this course of action upon the Iraq Government, His Majesty&apos;s Government continued to urge that Government to accept the Turkish Petroleum Company&apos;s application for an extension, although at that time this application was unaccompanied by any under-taking to construct a Railway or pipe-line to Haifa, and although another group was at that time in the field which had promised to undertake the construction of such a Railway. On this point I would particularly invite the attention of the Cabinet to paragraph 9 of the enclosed memorandum.In order, however, to confirm the impression given in his various telegraphic reports, I have caused Sir Henry Dobbs, who has recently retired from the office of High Commissioner for Iraq, to be consulted personally. He assures me that on no occasion did he intervene to press the Iraq Government to demand the construction of a railway or pipe-line to Haifa as a condition of the grant of an extension to the Turkish Petroleum Company.(v.) I understand that Sir M. Hankey is causing copies of a map of the whole region affected to be circulated to the Cabinet.L  S  a colonial Office, S.W. 1, March 16, 1929.   :Historical Note.On the 11th November, 1927, Sir Adam Ritchie, the General Manager of the Turkish Petroleum Company, informed Sir Henry Dobbs, then on leave in this country, that the Turkish Petroleum Company were contemplating the construc-tion of a pipe-line to the Mediterranean, but that, before they could undertake its construction, they must be free from the obligation, imposed on them by their Convention with the Iraq Government, to select their twenty-four plots for develop-ment before the 14th November, 1928. At the end of December 1927 Sir Henry Dobbs telegraphed from Iraq that Sir Adam Ritchie was proposing to visit Baghdad during the following month with proposals for approaching the Iraq Government for an indefinite extension of the period allowed them for the selection of plots.In the course of inter-departmental correspondence which followed upon the receipt of this telegram, the Foreign Office raised objection to a proposal by the Colonial Office that the Iraq Government should be advised not to oppose the grant of a reasonable extension to the Turkish Petroleum Company. They pointed out that the result of granting such an extension would be to postpone the date upon which the Iraq Government were under obligation, in accordance with the terms of their Convention with the Turkish Petroleum Company, to offer for open competition
leases of plots within the area of the Company&apos;s Concession. This would, they apprehended, afford an opportunity for foreign States to complain that, contrary to the non-discriminatory provisions of Article 11 of the Anglo-Iraq Treaty of 1922, there had been discrimination against their nationals. It might also, the Foreign Office considered, give rise to legitimate criticism on the part of the Permanent Mandates Commission.On learning of the objections felt by the Foreign Office, it was decided to ask Sir J. Cadman to submit a Memorandum giving in detail the reasons that rendered it desirable that an extension should be granted. Sir J. Cadman submitted his Memorandum on the 30th January, 1928, and asked for an extension of ten years of the period allowed for the selection of plots. In the meantime Sir Adam Ritchie had submitted a somewhat similar Memorandum to the Iraq Government but had not specified the exact period of the extension desired. Both Memoranda were carefully considered in consultation with the Foreign Office and the Board of Trade. The ten-year extension for which Sir J. Cadman had asked was considered to be too long, but it was agreed that in the interests of &quot;Iraq a five-year extension would be desirable, subject to certain stipulations directed towards the accelerated develop-ment of the oil-fields and the early construction of a pipe-line to the Mediterranean. It was felt that, if the proposed extension were to meet with criticism at Geneva, it would be easy, with the aid of the material contained in Sir J. Cadman&apos;s Memorandum, to show that the action taken was in the best interests of Iraq.3. That such an argument might be expected to weigh with the Permanent Mandates Commission is evident from the conclusion reached by that body at their 14th Session in the analagous case of the extension of thirty-five years granted by the Iraq Government to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company in respect of their con-cession in the &quot; transferred territories &quot;in Iraq. The action of the Iraq Government in granting this extension was, in the first place, challenged by the Permanent Mandates Commission as seemingly contrary to Article 11 of the Anglo-Iraq Treaty, but on it being represented to them that this action was calculated to produce important material benefits for Iraq, the Commission withdrew their previous criticism and, in their observations to the Council of the League, expressed them-seives as &quot;satisfied that the Iraq Government acted within the terms of Article 11 of the Treaty pf the 10th October, 1922, concerning economic equality in adopting the course it selected.&quot;4. On the 8th March a telegram was addressed to the High Commissioner for Iraq instructing him to recommend the Iraq Government to grant to the Turkish Petroleum Company a five-years&apos; extension provided that the company undertook (a) to proceed at once to develop actively the areas under test at present; and(b) should the results of such development prove satisfactory, to place an orderdefinitely for the construction of a pipe-line to the Mediterranean without waiting until their plots had been finally selected and to begin construc-tion at the earliest date possible.It will be observed that this instruction contained no mention of the proposed Baghdad-Haifa Railway nor any stipulation in regard to the Western terminal for the pipe-line to the Mediterranean.4a. Following upon direct negotiations . between the Iraq Government and Sir Adam Ritchie, the latter was informed at the end of March that the proposal for the grant of a five years&apos; extension was approved subject to the above conditions. Sir Adam Ritchie thereupon left Iraq and the revision of the Company&apos;s Convention with the Iraq, Government to give effect to this decision was left to be settled between the Iraq Government and the Company&apos;s local representative, Mr. Bull. On the 1st May, 1928, the Iraq Council of Ministers passed a Resolution approving a draft Agreement for that purpose, authorising the appropriate Minister to sign it, and, after signature, to prepare a draft Law with a view to submission of the Agreement to Parliament.   King Faisal, however, withheld his consent from this Resolution.5.   This action on the part of His Majesty was the result of the intervention of a new group, the BCD. (British Oil Development), who had entered the field in the latter part of April 1928 in search of Oil Concessions in Iraq, and had held out as an inducement to the Iraq Government a promise to construct, without subsidy [19005] b 2
or financial guarantee from that Government, a railway from Baghdad to Haifa. It was clearly impossible both to grant the extension asked for by the Turkish Petroleum Company and to satisfy the B.O.D.&apos;s application for an Oil Concession. Until the expiry of the period within which the Turkish Petroleum Company were entitled to select plots for development, the field was closed to all outside competition. The Iraq Government were, therefore, faced with two apparently incompatible demands, of which that of the B.O.D. seemed to them decidedly the more attractive.6. At the end of April Sir Henry Dobbs telegraphed reporting that he foresaw that if it became known in Iraq that a second powerful g&apos;roup had entered into competition wdth the Turkish Petroleum Company, the Iraq Parliament would refuse the extension applied for by the Turkish Petroleum Company. On the 4th May he telegraphed saying that the local representative of the B.O.D. had received instructions to deliver to King Faisal a letter informing him that Lord Wester Wemyss, on behalf of the group, -was leaving for Baghdad at once to lay before the Iraq Government proposals for the immediate exploitation of oil resources in Iraq and the construction of a railway to the Mediterranean. Sir Henry Dobbs anticipated that this letter would have the effect of causing the King to suspend giving his consent to the Resolution recently passed by the Council of Ministers approving the grant of as. extension to the Turkish Petroleum Company. As mentioned in paragraph 4 above the letter had the effect apprehended by Sir Henry Dobbs.7. On the 15th May he telegraphed that the Iraqi Prime Minister had received from London particulars of the offer of the B.O.D. to construct a railway from Baghdad to Haifa in return for the grant of Oil Concessions and that the King considered that, once the group&apos;s offer became known in Iraq, all prospect of the extension for the Turkish Petroleum Company passing through Parliament would disappear. On the following day a telegram was sent to the High Commissioner informing him that His Majesty&apos;s Government did not regard the fact that a rival group had appeared as adequate ground for modifying their attitude on the question of the extension for which the Turkish Petroleum Company had asked. The High Commissioner was, therefore, instructed to press King Faisal to approve the submission of the proposed extension to Parliament without delay. On the following day Sir Henry Dobbs telegraphed reporting that he had had a talk with King Faisal wrho said that he cared little about the Oil question in comparison with that of the construction of a railway to Haifa, and that, if the offer made, by the B.O.D. to construct such a railway at their own expense were confirmed (eventually, the B.O.D. substantially watered down their offer), it was obviously so advantageous to Iraq that Parliament would never consent to the Turkish Petroleum Company&apos;s extension, which would prevent advantage being taken of the B.O.D.&apos;s offer.8. In the meantime the volte-face on the part of the Iraq Government and the intervention of the B.O.D. had been reported by the local representative of the Turkish Petroleum Company to his Principals in London, with the result that the Board of the Company decided to send out Sir Adam Ritchie again to Baghdad to ascertain and report to them what were the real reasons responsible for the Iraq Governments change of front. Sir Adam Ritchie left London for Iraq in June 1928, and on the 6th July the High Commissioner telegraphed that Sir Adam Ritchie had seen King Faisal and the Prime Minister, and as a result was informing his Company by telegraph that such strong public feeling existed in Baghdad about the necessity for a railway to Haifa that he recommended that, in return for their five-year extension, a definite assurance should be given by the Turkish Petroleum Company that, if they constructed a pipe-line to the Mediterranean, they would by some means simultaneously arrange for the construction of the railway.9.   From the foregoing outline of events it is clear that (a) the association of the question of a railway from Baghdad to Haifa with that of oil development in Iraq did not originate with His Majesty&apos;s Government or their High Commissioner or with the Iraq Government; but was the direct result of the intervention of. the B.O.D.; 1     (6.) even after the intervention of the B.O.D. with their offer of a railway to ,   , Haifa, His Majesty&apos;s Government, continued to press the Iraq Govern-.    . ment to approve the Turkish Petroleum Company&apos;s application although it contained no such offer; and
(c) the suggestion that a somewhat similar offer should be made by the Turkish Petroleum Company originated not with His Majesty&apos;s Government but with Sir Adam Ritchie, after.the latter had learnt, as a result of a personal visit to Iraq, the strength of local feeling in favour of a railway to Haifa.10. As a result of Sir Adam Ritchie&apos;s telegram, the Company telegraphed to him on the 12th July to the effect that the Board would do their utmost to promote arrangements so that, simultaneously with the construction of a pipeJine, the construction of the Baghdad-Haifa Railway would be commenced. They added that, immediately upon the ratification of the five-year extension, they would be prepared to accept the principle of assisting in the guarantee of the railway in return for additional concessions and/or modifications in the present Convention. The Colonial Office were informed by Sir J. Cadman that these instructions had been sent after he had discussed the question personally with the Head of the French Petroleum Department (who had suggested the possibility of dividing the pipe-line at some point near the Iraq frontier and taking one part to a Syrian port and the other to Haifa), and after a formal Board Meeting of the Company.11. On receipt of these instructions Sir Adam , Ritchie informed the Iraq Government that the Turkish Petroleum Company undertook &quot; to assist with others in securing a guarantee for construction of a trans-desert railway from Baghdad to Haifa free of all cost to the Iraq Government but with option to the Iraq Government to take up shares. Further, my Company will endeavour to do its utmost to promote an arrangement with others which will ensure that the construction of the railway will be undertaken simultaneously with the construction of the pipe-line, should the construction of the railway at that time prove a commercial possibility.&quot; This undertaking, however, did not satisfy the Iraq Government, who, in the latter part of July, definitely rejected the Turkish Petroleum Company&apos;s proposals as being too indefinite to secure parliamentary support in face of the offer of the B.O.D. On the 26th July Sir J. Cadman telegraphed to Sir Adam Ritchie a message which was intended to be in the nature of an ultimatum to the Iraq Government. This message contained the statement that at the last Board Meeting the principle of support by the Turkish Petroleum Company for a railway from Baghdad to Haifa was secured subject to reasonable counter-consideration being granted. It is apparent that at that stage, at least, the Board of the Turkish Petroleum Company (including the French representatives) were fully prepared to promote the construction of a railway from Baghdad to Haifa.12. As a result of a further demarche by Sir Adam Ritchie, the Iraq Prime Minister promised him on the 28th July that the Iraq Government would attempt to obtain parliamentary acceptance of the Company&apos;s offer. On the following day, however, the Prime Minister consulted his party, who refused to endorse this programme. In the meantime a possible compromise had been suggested by the British Adviser to the Ministry of Communications and Works. This proposal was that the Iraq Government might grant the Turkish Petroleum Company an extension for a year or eig-hteen months in the first instance with a proviso that, if the Company should produce within that period a binding undertaking that the railway to Haifa would be constructed simultaneously with the pipe-line and without any guarantee or assistance from Iraq or His Majesty&apos;s Government, then the period would be extended to five years. The Iraq Government, on finding that they could not count upon parliamentary support for the Turkish Petroleum Company&apos;s offer, fell back upon the British Adviser&apos;s proposal. This proposal was reported by Sir Adam Ritchie to the Company, who, on the 1st August, authorised him to inform the Iraq Government that the Turkish Petroleum Company were prepared (a) to make at once a survey for a pipe-line and railway to the Mediterranean;(b) to examine the railway project in all its aspects, including discussion withother Governments interested with a view to a guarantee by the Turkish Petroleum Company; provided that the Iraq Government ;(1) would allow two years for this work; and,(2) if mutually satisfactory terms could be arranged during the said period of two years would undertake to grant the Railway Concession to the Turkish Petroleum Company or its nominees; and
ti(3) would extend the time limit under the existing Concession during the said two years&apos; examination and, if agreement on the above lines were reached, thereafter grant the balance of the five years&apos; extension already promised.13. The High Commissioner for Iraq was instructed on the 2nd August to do his utmost to induce the Iraq Government to accept this proposal, which was practically identical with that suggested by the Adviser to the Minister of Communications and Works. After making this offer to the Iraq Government. Sir Adam Ritchie returned to England, leaving the further conduct of negotiations in the hands of the Company&apos;s local representative, Mr. Bull. As a result of these negotiations, a revised draft Agreement, embodying the offer made by the Turkish Petroleum Company, was drawn up in Baghdad and approved by the Minister of Communications and Works and by Mr. Bull. A copy of this draft Agreement is appended to this Note (Appendix (A)). It will be seen that it committed the Company, in return for the grant of a two-year extension, to carry out a survey of a railway and pipe-line route between Baghdad and Haifa, and provided that, if within that period the Company decided to undertake the construction of the railway simultaneously with the construction of the pipe-line, the Company would be given a further three-year extension.On the 9th October Sir H. Dobbs telegraphed that, although this draft Agree-ment had been accepted by Mr. Bull on behalf of the Turkish Petroleum Company in a letter dated the 6th September, on the 8th September the Iraq Council of Ministers, when about to consider that Agreement, learnt that Mr. Skliros, who had recently-arrived in Iraq as the representative of the Turkish Petroleum Company, had been instructed to submit a revised draft. This draft differed in several important respects from that previously accepted by Mr. Bull. Inter alia, Haifa wras only mentioned in it as one among other possible Mediterranean terminals of the railway and pipe-line, and all reference to the question of construction of the railway simultaneously with that of the pipe-line was excluded. The High Commissioner reported that he did not think there w^as any prospect of these revised proposals being accepted by the Iraq Government, and that Mr. Skliros professed to be entirely ignorant of the reasons underlying his Company&apos;s change of front.14. On receipt of this telegram, Air. Amery wrote privately to Sir John Cadman, who wras at that time abroad, saying that he did not know what were the reasons that had induced the Turkish Petroleum Company to make so sudden a change of front just at the moment when the whole business seemed on the eve of settlement, that he agreed with Sir H. Dobbs that there was no chance of the Iraq Government accepting the Company&apos;s new proposals, and that he did not see how the British Government could recommend them to do so. He expressed the earnest hope that the Company might be persuaded to revert to the previous arrangement.15. On the 26th October, Mr. Lefroy, of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, called at the Colonial Office, on behalf of Sir John Cadman, who was still out of England, to present a further revised draft which had been prepared after discussion between the various groups of the Company with the object of meeting the objections felt by the Iraq Government to the draft presented by Mr. Skliros. The revised draft, although conceding certain of the Iraq Governments objections on points of comparative unimportance, left the Article in regard to the survey of the railway to the Mediterranean as indefinite as in the draft submitted by Mr. Skliros. The Article in question read as follows : &quot; Article 2. In consideration of the grant of extensions and permission to exchange plots set out in Article 1 hereof, the Company agrees.....(c) Having already surveyed a route for the pipe-line contemplated in the said Article 5, to commence forthwith, on the confirmation of this Agreement under Article 7 below, a survey of the line of a railway of not less than one-metre gauge from Baghdad to the Mediterranean Coast, including Haifa (hereinafter called &apos; Baghdad-Mediterranean Railway&apos;).&quot;16. Mr. Lefroy explained the events leading up to the framing of the draft presented by Mr. Skliros. He said that, owing to an oversight on the part of the Company&apos;s Secretariat, a copy of the original draft (i.e., that accepted by Mr. Bull) was erroneously placed on the table at a Board Meeting of the Company. It was not at that time known that this draft had been accepted by Mr. Bull, nor, in fact, had
3 6 6that information reached the Turkish Petroleum Company until the receipt by Sir John Cadman of the letter from Mr. Amery referred to above. At the close of the Board Meeting, one of the French Directors happened to pick up a copy of the draft Agreement and glanced through it. He immediately said that the terms of the draft Agreement would be wholly unacceptable to himself and his French colleagues, and demanded that it be radically revised. In particular, he took the strongest exception to the mention of Haifa as the terminus both of the pipe-line and the trans-desert railway. With the object of placating the French interests in the Company, and still in ignorance of the fact that the draft Agreement had been accepted by Mr. Bull, a revised draft had been prepared, and, after the concurrence of the members of the Board (including the French) had been obtained, Mr. Skliros was instructed to present this draft to the Iraq Government. Since that date, not only had the Turkish Petroleum Company learnt that the draft would prove unacceptable to the Iraq Government, but the French Directors, after consulting their own Company and the Quai d&apos;Orsay, had stated that they felt the strongest objection to the bare mention of Haifa as a possible terminus to the pipe-line and railway. To their mind, the mention of Haifa without &amp;ny mention of Syrian ports would give the impression in France that the selection of that port as the terminus was already a chose jugee: This, they represented, would catise an outcry in France, where in view of the San Remo Agreement, it was popularly believed that the terminus of the pipe-line must necessarily be in Syria. Mr. Lefroy made it clear that it might be impossible to obtain French consent to the mere mention of Haifa in connection with the survey of the trans-desert railway, and that in this matter it was quite possible that the American interests would align themselves on the side of their French colleagues.17. On the 29th October Sir J. Cadman called at the Colonial Office and was seen by Mr. Amery. He explained the difficulty he was experiencing with his French colleagues on the Board and pointed out that he would have the greatest difficulty in inducing them to accept any Agreement which would appear to pre-judge the question of the Mediterranean terminal of the pipe-line and railway or which could be held to imply that Haifa would necessarily be that terminal.Mr. Amery pointed out that there was little prospect of the Iraq Government accepting any Agreement which did not specifically bind the Company to carry out the survey of the route of a railway to Haifa, and subsequently to submit a detailed project for the construction of such a railway. He explained that the Iraq Parliament would not be prepared to contemplate any route which would involve the proposed railway having its terminus at a Syrian Port, since they were determined that no part of such a. railway should be under French control. It was suggested to Sir J. Cadman that a possible solution might be found in so recasting Article 2 (c) of the Revised Draft (quoted in paragraph 15 above) as to make it clear that the question of the route for the pipe-line, or pipe-lines, did not necessarily depend upon the route to be followed by the trans-desert railway. By this means it could be represented to the French interests on the Turkish Petroleum Company that, by undertaking to carry out a survey of a railway to Haifa, that Company would not commit themselves in the matter of the route to be followed by the pipe-line. After further discussion, the following revised draft of the Article was agreed upon :  &quot; In addition to the survey of the routes for the pipe-line, or pipe-lines, from the oil-fields to the Mediterranean contemplated in the said Article 5, to commence forthwith, on the confirmation of this Agreement under Article 7 below, a survey of the line &quot;of a railway of not less than one metre-gauge from Baghdad to Haifa (hereafter called the &apos; Baghdad-Mediterranean Railway &apos;).&quot;Sir J. Cadman undertook to lay this text before the Company at their Board Meeting on the 30th October, and appeared confident of his ability to get it accepted.18. On the 31st October he wrote to Air. Amery explaining that at their Meeting on the previous day his Board had accepted the revised Agreement in to to, with exception of the vital word &quot;Haifa&quot; in Article 2 (c). The Board had, however, agreed to the Survey of the Railway from Baghdad to Haifa and to include this in a separate letter, a copy of which Sir J. Cadman enclosed (copy in Appendix (B)). He explained that the French Group had expressed their readiness to cite Haifa definitely in a letter from the Turkish Petroleum Company to the Iraq Government, which would bind the Company as completely as would its mention in the Agreement,
&quot; but refused to approve any bi-lateral document containing such an &apos; Acte politique &apos; by Iraq.&quot;19. On receipt of Sir J. Cadman&apos;s letter, an inter-departmental Conference was called, under the chairmanship of Air. Amery, to consider what should be the next step. As a result of the conclusions of this Conference, at which, inter alias, the Foreign Office were represented, Mr. Amery wrote to Sir J. Cadman on the 7th November agreeing to press the Iraq Government to accept the expedient of a letter, provided that the wording of that letter were so altered as to bind the Turkish Petroleum Company as completely in the matter of Haifa as would the express mention of that Port in the text of the Agreement. The revised formula suggested in Mr. Amery&apos;s letter is reproduced in Appendix (C).On the 8th November Sir J. Cadman wrote to Mr. Amery accepting the revised formula and stating that he had already given instructions for it to be cabled to the Company&apos;s representative in Baghdad and submitted, with the revised draft Agree-ment, to the Iraq Government. The High Commissioner was thereupon instructed by telegraph to do his utmost to induce the Iraq Government to accept the arrange-ment proposed.The revised Draft Agreement and the draft complementary letter of assurance from the Turkish Petroleum Company were submitted officially by Mr. Skliros to the Iraq Government on the 9th November, 1928.20. At this stage, however, the political crisis occasioned by the breakdown of the negotiations between His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Iraq Government in regard to the revised Alilitary and Financial Agreements supervened and occupied the whole attention of the Iraqi Cabinet. This crisis led to the resignation of the Cabinet before that body could be induced to accept the draft Agreement submitted by the Turkish Petroleum Company.21. In the meantime it was learnt that the decision of Sir John Cadman to accept the revised formula recommended in Mr. Amery&apos;s letter of the 7th November had involved him in difficulties with his French colleagues on the Board of the Turkish Petroleum Company, and that he had only succeeded in obtaining confirmation of the action which he had taken by making the matter a personal vote of confidence. Sir J. Cadman had previously written to the representative of the French Group on the 9th November, explaining why he had found it necessary to modify the formula agreed upon by the Board. This action, he explained, was necessary, &quot; afin d&apos;obtenir 1&apos;entier appui de la puissance mandataire et une pression suffisante sur les Iraquiens.&quot; It is clear from all that had passed that the pressure to be exercised by His Majesty&apos;s Government was not pressure to insist on the line being built to Haifa, but pressure to accept the separate letter as a sufficient equivalent for the modification of the Agreement. This letter was, however, made the basis of the protest by the French Ambassador on the 16th November against the alleged political intervention by His Majesty&apos;s Government in the affairs of the Turkish Petroleum Company. The Ambassadors call was followed by further representations culminating in the series of French demarches which formed the subject of the memo-randum circulated by Mr. Amery to the Cabinet on the 11th March (CP. 73 (29)).22. In these demarches the French Government have made a great deal of play with the San Remo Agreement. They have not actually alleged that that Agreement creates a definite obligation to adopt a Syrian alignment for the pipe-line to the Mediterranean, but that they profess to regard the adoption of an alignment through Palestine as contrary to the spirit and intention, if not the letter, of that Instrument is apparent from the general tenor of their communications. It might not therefore be out of place to consider to what extent His Majesty&apos;s Government (and through them the Iraq Government) really are committed under the San Remo Agreement in the matter of the route to be taken by the pipe-line and the Trans-desert Railway. The relevant articles of that Agreement read as follows : &quot;Article 10. In consideration of the above-mentioned arrangements, the French Government shall agree, if it is desired and as soon as application is made, to the construction of two separate pipe-lines and railways necessary for their construction and maintenance, and for the transport of oil from Mesopotamia and Persia through French spheres of influence to a port or ports on the Eastern Mediterranean. The port or ports shall be chosen in agreement between the two Governments.
Article 11. Should such pipe-line and railways cross territory within a French sphere of influence, France undertakes to give every facility for the rights of crossing without any royalty or way-leaves on the oil transported. Neverthe-less compensation shall be payable to the landowners for the surface occupied.&quot;These Articles appear to contain nothing which could reasonably be held to commit His Majesty&apos;s Government or the Iraq Government to the adoption of a Syrian alignment for the pipe-line to the Mediterranean. The effect of these Articles would seem to be that the French Government undertake, in return for the &quot; consideration &quot; mentioned in Article 10, to grant certain facilities (way-leaves, &amp;c.) in Syria for the construction of such a pipe-line &quot; if it is desired and as soon as application is made.&quot; The most important part of the &quot; consideration,&quot; namely, French participation in the share-holding of the Turkish Petroleum Company, has already been conceded and, therefore, if the pipe-line eventually^ passes exclusively through British Mandated territory-, the position would appear to be that the French have, in fact, received their &quot; consideration &quot; without having been called upon to discharge their own side of the bargain. The last sentence of Article 10 might, however, if taken by- itself, conceivably be held to bind His Majesty&apos;s Government to choose the port on the Eastern Mediterranean in agreement with the French Government, and thus to give the latter a right of veto to the selection of Haifa. This interpretation could not, it is considered, be juridically sustainable, since the conditional clause in the first sentence of Article 10 (&quot;if it is desired.and as soon as application is made&quot;) must obviously qualify the last sentence (&apos;1 the port or ports shall be chosen in agreement between the two Governments&quot;). This interpretation of the relevant Articles of the San Remo Agreement, which has been accepted as correct by the Foreign Office, is based upon that Instrument alone. It finds further support, however, in the Franco-British Convention of the 23rd December, 1920. The following passages extracted from that Convention clearly demonstrate that, before the San Remo Agreement was drawn up, the possibility of the construction of a railway and pipe-line to the Mediterranean following a route exclusively within British Mandated territory was contemplated and that special provision therefor was held to be necessary in framing the boundary settlement between French and British spheres of influence. These extracts provide an important gloss upon the provisions of the San Remo Agreement: &quot;Article 5. (3.) The French Government consents to the nomination of a special Commission, wdiich, after having examined the ground, may readjust the above-mentioned frontier line in the Valley of the Yarmuk as far as Nasib in such manner as to render possible the construction of the British railway and pipe-line connecting Palestine with the Hedjaz Railway and the Valley of the Euphrates, and running entirely7 within the limits of the areas under the British Mandate.....(4.) In the event of the track of the British railway being compelled for technical reasons to enter in certain places the territory under French Mandate, the French Government will recognise the full and complete extra-territoriality of the sections thus lying in the territory under Franch Mandate.....&quot;23. Before closing this historical note, mention should be made of the survey of possible routes for a pipe-line to the Mediterranean carried out on behalf of the Turkish Petroleum Company in the Spring of 1928. The survey party, which was originally in the charge of a Mr. Hay, who unfortunately died after carrying out the survey of possible Syrian alignments, was finally completed by Major Holt, who was loaned to the Company by the Iraq Railways Department.On the completion of his survey, Major Holt submitted a report to the Company in December 1928, strongly recommending an alignment through Trans-Jordan and Palestine with Haifa as its western terminal. Almost simultaneously with the presentation of his Report, the French Group in the Turkish Petroleum Company, who had been shown a copy of the Report in draft by the French member of the survey party, presented a report produced by an eminent French hydrographer and designed to throw doubt upon the data upon which Major Holt had based his favourable report upon Haifa as the most suitable terminal. For this purpose, the French expert produced data Avhich, in Major Holfs opinion, based upon the meteorological records in this country and in Palestine, greatly exaggerated the frequency of unfavourable winds at Haifa. Major Holt returned to the charge with a counter-memorandum throwing doubt upon the figures adduced by the French [19005] c
expert, and showing that, both on the ground of prevailing winds and other considerations, Haifa was definitely preferable to Tripoli, which the French expert had recommended as possessing greater advantages as a port. Both these reports, it is understood, were considered at a recent Board Meeting of the Turkish Petroleum Company, when it was decided to send out four experts, one appointed by each of the groups of the Company, to investigate the suitability of the Port of Tripoli as the Mediterranean terminal of the pipe-line.Middle East Department, Colonial Office, March 16, 1929.APPENDIX (A).Draft Agreement between the Iraq Government and Turkish Petroleum Company.AGREEMENT made this        day of , one thousand nine hundredand twenty-eight, between his Excellency Haji Abdul Muhsin Shalash, the Minister of Communications and Works, acting on behalf of the Government of Iraq (hereinafter called the Government) of the one part, and Hilary Carol Howard Bull, acting on behalf of the Turkish Petroleum Company Limited, having its Registered Offices at 97, Gresham Street in the City of London (hereinafter called the Company) of the other part.Whereas the parties have agreed between themselves that it is desirable to extend the periods of selection under Articles 5 and 6 of the Convention, dated 14th day of March, 1925, made between the Iraq Government and the Turkish Petroleum Company, Ltd.
