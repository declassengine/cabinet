PRICES OF PETROLEUM PRODUCTS.18th March, 1929.1 This statement is made by the Anglo-American Oil Company Limited, by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company Limited, and by Shell-Mex Limited, the three Companies furnishing to the consumer of petroleum products a complete supply service in every part of the British Isles.It is made in response to His Majesty&apos;s Governments invitation to these Companies (as announced by the Prime Minister in the House of Commons on 7th March, 1929) to explain the reason for the increases as from 1st March, 1929, of 2\d. and per gallon in the price of motor-spirit and of kerosene respectively.2. Despite the increase in question, the retail price of motor-spirit in London to-day, after allowing for Duty, is lower, and for the most part very much lower, than at any time during the last ten years  except for the twenty-three months April, 1927, to February, 1929 (see Annex C). That period of almost two years represented a temporary and artificial phase, a brief description of which will demonstrate the reason for the recent increase in price.3. For many months consumers of motor-spirit and kerosene in this country have paid prices which are not &quot; world-prices &quot; a term of which the full significance is later explained (see paragraph 4 et seq.).What is known as &quot; dumping &quot; is a familiar feature of trade in the case of many commodities, i.e., the importation during a period, of supplies produced under artificial or purely temporary economic conditions, at prices below those at which the permanent supplier can regularly import. Importations of this kind can be sufficient in quantity to affect very materially the operations of responsibie importers who year in and year out provide for the permanent continuous supply of the requirements of the nation. But in the United Kingdom, after the end of 1927, there developed a situation far more severe than any mere &quot; dumping &quot; however aggravated could have caused. Supplies controlfed by the Union of Soviet Republics, and available to it under conditions bearing no relation to those of any other traders throughout the world, have been sold in the United Kingdom by the organisation of the Soviet Republics at prices not only below, but definitely far below the level of world-values.   The three Companies were compelled either to meet this(36489)   Wt.       / 2000   3/29   Harrow.   G.3.A2
situation, or to withdraw, partly or to a great extent, from the trade. % In the nature of things, this state of affairs could not continue indefinitely ; but it was not until the end of February, 1929, that arrangements were reached which terminated the &quot; price-war &quot; that had existed in this country for almost two years, thereby per-mitting a return towards that world-level of prices which in the long run is essential to the maintenance of supplies for the British Market.PETROLEUM A WORLD COMMODITY.4. Great Britain&apos;s annual consumption of motor-spirit amounts to more than 2\ million tons ; but that of the whole world is about 50 million tons. Home sources of production contribute only a small part of Britain&apos;s supplies.    (See Annex A).Motor-spirit is one of the products obtained, by distillation, manufacture and treatment, from natural petroleum (called &quot; crude&quot;), virtually none of which in its original form can be used industrially or domestically. The term &quot;crude&quot;, therefore, signifies the raw material in the form in which it is originally found in underground deposits and raised by means of wells to the earth&apos;s surface. From that &quot; raw material &quot; motor-spirit is obtained as one of a number of products, none of which can be obtained without involving the manufacture of others.In addition to motor-spirit, the other products derived from &quot; crude &quot; include kerosene (&quot; paraffin &quot;), lubricating oil, paraffin wax, fuel oil, asphalt, et cetera, for all of which a market must be found if motor-spirit is to be produced. Of the total quantity of &quot; crude &quot; won from the earth, the quantity of motor-spirit derived (taking a world average) is about two-sevenths. The remainder yields a widely varying range of products, regulated in quantity and quality by the particular nature of the &quot; crude.&quot;5. In 1928, &quot; crude &quot; raised from natural deposits, and that by over four thousand different producers throughout the world, totalled more than ISO million tons. Of that quantity the United States produced more than 120 million tons. The United States, Mexico, the West Indies, and the Northern States of South America, together produced over 150 million tons, or in excess of four-fifths of the world-total.The Gulf of Mexico may therefore be said to constitute the &quot;centre of gravity&quot; of the world&apos;s petroleum trade;   and in consequence the prices ruling there represent the basis of world-lvalues for petroleum products.
6. Great Britain&apos;s importation of all petroleum products does not exceed 4 per cent, of the world&apos;s total consumption, and therefore the extent of her imports is not such as to exercise by itself any powerful influence upon the value of world supplies.MARKETERS,  AND   MARKETING  FUNCTIONS,  IN THE UNITED KINGDOM.7. The following is a description of the organisation of the three Companies responsibie for satisfying more than three-quarters of this country&apos;s petroleum requirements.   .8. (a) The Anglo-American Oil Company is a marketing company established in the early days of the petroleum industry. It has created, and it maintains, a comprehensive organisation for the safe of alf petrofeum products demanded by British consumers.(b) The Angio-Persian Oil Company annually produces, from Persia, more than 5 million tons of &quot; crude &quot; petroleum, i.e., about 3 per cent, of the world&apos;s total. That production is sold partly in the United Kingdom and in certain other European countries, and partly in markets of the Eastern Hemisphere nearer to Persia. For purposes of distribution and sale in England and Wales, it operates through its subsidiary the British Petroleum Company Limited.(c) Shell-Mex Limited constitutes the &quot; royal-Dutch-Shell &quot; group&apos;s organisation responsible for sales in the United Kingdom. That group the &quot; Royal-Dutch-Shell &quot; is interested in the production and marketing of petroleum products in many parts of the world.Of the business of the entire &quot; Royal-Dutch-Shell&quot; group not more than 6 per cent, is done in Great Britain.9. It is a decided advantage for Great Britain, an importer, to keep her markets open to receive supplies from all world-sources rather than to rely on any single source of supply.The duty of Great Britain&apos;s importing and marketing organisa-tions is to secure and safeguard supplies, by methods related not to one but to all suitable sources of supply; and, within the country, to develop the highest attainable degree of efficiency as petroleum distributors. Only thus can the interests of the British consumer best be served.The appended Table (Annex A) shows the countries of origin of Great Britain&apos;s motor-spirit supplies. It will be seen that many countries contribute.
10. There is no theoretical or practical obstacle closing the British market to any organisation willing to rival and excel the three Companies in quality, in service or in price in all or any of the territory over which the three Companies offer uniform service. Neither by national sentiment, by national interest, nor by Act of Parliament, is the British market induced to favour any single source of supply or method of service.11. It is only as a result of their highly organised service in providing throughout all parts of the country and in abnormal as well as in normal times -abundant facilities and consistent quality of motor-spirit at reasonable prices, that the three Companies have become the suppliers of the great mass of consumers in this country.BASIS OF PRICE.12. Over a considerable period, the price-basis at an importing market of any size necessarily conforms to that of its largest supply-market. From Annex A it will be seen that 70 per cent, of Great Britain&apos;s motor-spirit requirements is drawn from the United States, Mexico and the northern part of South America three countries which constitute the nearest large source of supply. Consequently, the price ruling in the Gulf of Mexico i.e., the &quot;U.S. Gulf,&quot; which governs all these markets is the price which in normal circumstances must dominate the price ruling in Great Britain.MOTOR SPIRIT.13. The &quot; U.S. Gulf &quot; export market caters for many varying requirements of quality. It is therefore necessary to arrive at some standard of comparative values, as among the grades regularly &quot; quoted &quot; in that market and those required by the British con-sumer.14. A standard of general comparison is afforded by the particular quality specified by the United States Government, and now known throughout the markets of the world as &quot; U.S. New Navy Gasolene.&quot; Further, &quot; U.S. New Navy &quot; grade approximates very closely, in quality, to that which is in greatest demand throughout the American Continent.15. The qualities sold in Great Britain as &quot; Commercial &quot; (or &quot; No. 3 &quot;) grades are superior to &quot; U.S. New Navy &quot; gasolene; and in value they are comparable with the grade, designated &quot; 60/62 Beaume,&quot; of which the &quot; U.S. Gulf &quot; export quotations are set out in Annex E.
16. Annex E is a table of &quot; U.S. Gulf &quot; export prices 1922 to 1929, made up from prices published officially, and for purposes of brevity confined to prices of business done in the first week of each of the months shown. As will be seen, for all grades of motor-spirit, world-prices as reflected in.&quot; U.S. Gulf &quot; export prices rose steadily during the greater part of 1928, and to-day stand substantially higher than at the end of 1927. The following prices (in cents per American gallon) are extracted from Annex E : Date. December, 1927 May, 1928 March, 1929&quot; 64/66 Beaumi &quot; Spirit. 891 10&quot; 60/62 Beaumi &quot; Spirit. 71 8f 91&quot; U.S.Neiv Navy &quot; Gasolene. 7 81-8i;17. The current &quot; U.S. Gulf &quot; export value of &quot; 60/62 Beaume &quot; Spirit is 9J cents per American gallon. An American gallon is equal to -833, or approximately five-sixths, of an Imperial gaffon. Cal-culated to the nearest farthing the equivalent of 9J cents perAmerican gailon is 5f per Imperial gallon. From this point, the following table gives current costs up to the point of delivery by the importer and distributor to the retail dealer or the commercial consumer each item calculated to the nearest farthing : -Commercial Spirit.Cost prior to Arrival in U.K.&quot;U.S. Gulf&quot; Export Price (March, 1929)-9Jc. per American gallon or   ..

Since approximately only 20 per cent, of total United Kingdom deliveries are now made in packages, i.e., in cans or barrels, the foregoing costs are those for &quot; bulk &quot; (i.e., non-packed) delivery.
18. The three Companies are, of course, &quot; wholesalers,&quot; nof* &quot;retailers.&quot;   It is estimated that less than half their motor-spirit sales are made to dealers for re-sale at the retail price ; the remainder comprises sales to commercial consumers.The &quot; price realised&quot; (as recently increased) by the three Companies for commercial spirit supplied to dealers in &quot; bulk,&quot; i.e. not supplied in cans, is arrived at as follows : In &quot; London Zone &quot; (i.8. including an area       In the of approximately        English 60 miles radius round     Provinces. London).Retail price (commercial quality) paidby private motorist March, 1929        1/5 1/5-tDealer&apos;s margin..       ..       ..       ..        -/3* -/3*Price realised by the Companies      ..        1/2 1/2iThe average gross price realised for all sales is less than those just given, because allowance must be made for the rebates made to large commercial users who take their supplies direct from the &quot; wholesaler.&quot; These rebates vary according to consumption. In the aggregate, the price received by the Companies falls below the retail or private motorists&apos; &quot; pump &quot; price by approximately 3ld. per gallon. The average price realised by the Companies, therefore, is not Is. 2d. and Is. 2\d\, but Is. 5d. and Is. 5\d. less 3hd.,in each case-i.e. Is. l^d. in the &quot; London Zone &quot; and Is. 2d. in the English provinces respectively ; as against a &quot; Total Cost,&quot; brought out in the preceding paragraph, of Is. 2d. per gallon.19. As will be seen, these calculations relate to &quot; Commercial&quot; spirit, which constitutes the major portion of the trade. But most private car owners use &quot; First-quality &quot; motor-spirit. This grade therefore, is universally stocked at garages throughout the country, and car-owners thus enjoy a complete service in almost even-village, however remote. For this service a special system of detailed distribution must be maintained ; and, as a result, the first-grade &quot; cost of distribution &quot; is appreciably higher than that of &quot; Commercial &quot; spirit.Furthermore, some explanation is necessary as to the distinctive quality of the respective First-grade brands sold by the three Companies, for which a higher price is realised than for commercial grades. _*Note.- (i) These figures include a rebate of Id. per gallon payable to Dealers who satisfy certain conditions. To-day, these conditions are satisfied by almost all Dealers with whom the three groups do business.(ii) The Dealer&apos;s margin of 3d. represents his &quot; gross income,&quot; not &quot; profit.&quot;  Out of it he pays his expenses.
*- Among the factors of which, in its development, Britain&apos;s motor -car manufacturing industry has taken particular account are (1) the excellence of British roads, and (2) the influence upon motor car design, of the special formula adopted by Parliament for calculating the motor-car tax. That industry has therefore been characterised by special attention to the perfection (naturally resulting in the popular use) of motor-cars having high-compression engines of small dimensions, but of high effective power and of economy in fuel consumption.Their perfection and popular use could never have been attained but for the evofution of the particular quality of motor-spirit best calculated to produce, from such a type Of engine, the maximum degree of effective power and the minimum of fuel consumption.In order to secure and ensure sufficient suppiies of first-quality products, the Companies have not restricted themselves to any single source of supply. In the result, their first-quality spirits (some brought from remote sources of supply) although differing in some respects one from another, are each the result of many years&apos; scientific research ; and they afford the finest attainable complement of the high-efficiency motor-engines produced by the British manufacturer.Although, not unnaturally, the price of first-quality (so-called &quot; No. 1 &quot;) spirit is commonly adopted as the subject of analysis and criticism, no such analysis or criticism is valid unless full account be taken of these special characteristics of quality and of value. In short, first-quality spirit is a commodity produced to meet a special requirement.Since it represents a blend of various spirits, no direct comparison can be made with &quot; U.S. Gulf &quot; prices.KEROSENE.20. On 1st March, 1929, the wholesale price of Kerosene, marketed in the United Kingdom by the three Companies, was raised l^d. per gallon. Much of the foregoing argument applies mutatis mutandis to Kerosene with no less force than to motor-spirit. Schedules are annexed showing (a) &quot; U.S. Gulf &quot; export quotations for two qualities of Kerosenefrom 1922 to date Annex F, and (6) a Table of U.K. wholesale selling prices for Kerosene from1914 to 1929-Annex D.Retail prices of Kerosene are in no sense dictated by the three Companies, nor do the Companies fix or maintain the &quot; Dealer&apos;s margin.&quot;   Wholesale prices, as increased on 1st March, 1929, can
be built up on &quot; U.S. Gulf &quot; prices in the same manner as thr &quot;fc adopted for motor-spirit. The calculation is as follows :  &apos;Kerosene. Pence per ImperialCost prior to arrival in U.K.  GallonThe&quot;U.S. Gulf&quot;   export price  (March,  1929) for Kerosene of the quality in most common use in Great Britain 6f c. per American Gallon or 4Cost of ocean transport (Gulf to U.K.), ocean insur-ance and leakage        ..       ..       ..       ..       ..

Annex B records the striking growth in the consumption of motor-spirit in the United Kingdom since 1913. As will be observed, the rate of increase of 1926/27, i.e., 12-6 per cent, has been re-produced in 1927/28. While in 1920 the total trade was 587,000 tons, by 1928 it had expanded to a figure of 2,776,000 tons an increase of 373 per cent. As will be observed from the same appendix, the current price, in London, of first-quality and commercial spirits (including the existing duty of Ad. per gaUon, which exceeds the 1914 duty by Id.) is 2d. per gallon below that of 1914. This is due to various causes, one of which is a large reduction effected by the Companies in the cost of distribution a reduction facilitated by expansion in the volume of consumption.22. Although distributing companies in Britain as in every other country are dependent on world-supplies, obtainable at world-prices, the result of that dependence has in no way affected the British consumer unjustly. As part of their normal procedure, the three Companies do their best to foresee the trend of world-prices and A-make advance arrangements to secure ample supplies and reasonably stable prices which will be influenced only to an equitab degree by changes in world prices.ANGLO-AMERICAN    ANGLO-PERSIAN OIL SHELL-MEX, OIL COMPANY, Limited.

DQCUISNT 13 TrS PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT,3ECPE?P.P.   (29) 2.Copy No,CAB  IKE T,PSTROLEUK PRICES.I circulate a memorandum prepared In my Department on the Oil Companies&apos; Statement with the conclusions of which I am in entire agreement.P.C-L.Board, -of &quot;Trade,21st March, 1929.
3 Q AMemorandum by Petroleum Department on Oil Companies&apos; statement of the 18th March.1, The figures in the  statement have been checked and arecorrect so far as information obtained from independent sources is available in the Department.    On page 8 the figures are calculated to the nearest farthing, and this has worked out slightly to the advantage of the companies on the figures of cost prior to arrival in the United Kingdom.2. The whole statement is built up on the assumption that thecompanies are justified in taking the wholesale price of Ccnmercial (No.3) petrol at American Gulf ports as a proper starting point.    In our view this is correct.    The distributing companies in this country are subsidiary to the producing and :manufacturing companies established on the continent of America and it is reasonable that the parent company should charge the subsidiary company the ordinary market price for its products. There is no reason why a lower price should be charged in this transaction than when the producing company sells to an independent distributing company.    This principle has been established quite clearly in connection with the mining industry in this country, where it has been agreed that coal passed from the mining company to a subsidiary company, whether manufacturing or distributing, shall be transferred at the current market price of coal at the pit, and the Miners&apos; Federation take every possible step to ensure that this principle is not evaded by the mining companies.3. The costs of distribution by the wholesale companies,which are included in the statement, appear to be reasonable when it is remembered that in 1920 these costs were 7^d. per gallon and have since been gradually reduced to 3^d.The references are in cp, 86 (29).-1-
The margin allowed to the dealer for expenses and profit, namely 3d. per gallon (including rebates), appears generous in comparison with the New York Margin of ifd. but the enormous volume of trade in a small area in New York ena/bles the dealer to work for a smaller margin per gallon than he can in the United Kingdom,    In the dealers margin also there has been a reduction, as until Ai^gust 1921 it was 4-gd. on first quality and it has since been gradually reduced to its present figure of 3d.according to Information supplied by the Mercantile Marine Department, the range of freight rates for motor spirit and kerosene from the Gulf to the United Kingdom ports from January to August 1928, including marine insurance and leakage, varied from .83d. per Imperial gallon (the highest figure) to .67d. per Imperial gallon,  (the lowest figure).    The average was .75d, which is the figure used in the Oil Companies&apos;  explanatory statement.    During November and December there was a slump in freights to .55d. per Imperial gallon.    On the whole we cannot quarrel with the fd. per gallon ocean freight charge adopted by the Companies.In the statement dealing with kerosene prices the companies have allowed 4d. per gallon for charges and distribution costs in the United Kingdom as against S-^-d. per gallon for commercial petrol.      The difference of -J-d. per gallon is accounted for by the fact that kerosene is distributed to retailers in much smaller quantities and, therefore, by more expensive methods than the delivery of commercial spirit of bulk to large consumers.Taking all these factors into account, one is forced to the conclusion that the Anglo-American Oil Company and the Shell Hex Company have shown that the prices they are charging for commercial petrol and kerosene are not unreasonable on the basis of Gulf prices.There remains for consideration two points: whether a similar increase in Ho.  1 petrol is   justified, and whether the Anglo-
Persian Company were justified in following the lead of the two other big distributing companies.The 2 d.. per gallon difference between first grade motor spirit and commercial spirit represents -J-d, additional costs of distribution due to the fact that the distribution of this petrol, being exclusively amongst private motorists, is spread over a very large number of depots each holding a comparatively small quantity.,    The remaining 1-g-d^  is  due to the better quality of the spirit,A statement from the Anglo-Persian Oil Company reconciling the price of No.1 petrol in this country with a similar-quality of petrol in New York is attached.,  (Statement A). On this basis this country has no cause for complaint, and similarly Paris, Brussels,, Berlin and Madrid the price for No,l motor spirit is as high or higher after allowance is made for varying duties,In the view of the Board of Trade, the Anglo-Persian have really no alternative but to work in conjunction with the other two big distributing companies,ITe are not in a position to say whether the Anglo-Persian could,  if they -wished, sell at a lower price than the American companies, because, while American Gulf prices, plus transport, have no direct relation to the c.i.f. price of Persian petroleum products,  the price of petrol cannot be judged without taking into consideration the costs of production, manufacture and sale of the other products which represent five sevenths of-the whole,&quot;Je do not feel that we can say positively that the Anglo-Persian Company are justified in charging their distributing Company with Persian oil at Gulf prices, if in fact they do so,    Following the reasoning In paragraph 2 the fair transfer price of Persian oil would be the price at which Persian oil is sold to Independent buyers.    There Is no
general market quotation, in Persian Oil on which to base an opinion.     But, even if the fair transfer price of persian oil should be lower than the Gulf price, it does rot follow that it would be reasonable tc expect the Anglo-Persian Company to sell petrol at a lower price than that which Is reasonable for the Anglo-American and the Shell.If the Angla-Persian started a price war in the United Kingdom, they would   undoubtedly be attacked in the Eastern markets by the foreign controlled companies, who would probably also retaliate by forcing down the price of other petroleum products below a price which the Anglo-Persian Company could afford.     They could do this without serious effect on their own finances beoause the total petroleum products consumed In Great Britain are only 4 per cent of the world1s consumption.If the Anglo*-Persian Company conducted a price war in this country there Is little doubt that they would be defeated by the other two, woulA cease to exist as distributors and would be obliged to  confine their operations to production and manufacture,      This would leave the two foreign controlled companies with a clear field and  the last state of this country would be worse than the first,In this connection it must also be remembered that the agreement between the Anglo-Persian Company and the Persian Government stipulates that a royalty of 16 per cent, of the net yearly profits is payable to the Persian Government and the Company have agreed that it will nut enter into any.fictitious or artificial action which \vould have the effect of reducing the amount of royalty payable.Even If His Majesty1 s Government were not satisfied with the general policy followed by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company in these matters,  It would not appear to be possible,  in view of Treasury letter of  the 20th May 1914  (copy attached Statement B) to inter-fere in Its ordinary administration as a commercial concern.
It is of interest to note from, recent press statements that the General Conservation Committee of the American Petroleum Institute adopted on 16th March a recommendation that from April 1st, the output of crude oil in the United States, Lexico and Korth and South America should &quot;be restricted so as   -not to exceed the average daily production of 1928 u    The dally average production so far this year has been climbing steadily until there are now several hundred thousand barrels in excess of last year&apos;s average,Regional committees of the General Conservation Committee are asked to report to the American Petroleum Institute&apos;on March 27 th whether the terms of the recommendation can be carried out,It is understood that the American Petroleum Institute is representative of all the major oil production companies in the United States, Mexico and North and South America.During last week daily production of crude oil from these countries was down 41,000 barrels  (equals 1,435,000 English gallons).    A reduction of   8 per cent, or 219,000 barrels a day (7,665,000 English gallons) will be necessary to carry out the American Petroleum Instituted recommendation,    The   United Kingdom draws 70 per cent, of its petrol from the countries whose production Is subject to this res trietion,,This restriction is interesting in view of the attitude of the United States towards the British scheme of rubber restriction.
9. A comparison of Gulf prices with retail prices priorto 1927 (when the Oil Companies state that the Russian competition began seriously to affect prices) shows that while the present price is In keeping, no further increase can be justified unless Gulf prices rise.    It must, however, be emphasised that as the Gulf market is dominated by the producing and manufacturing companies, of which the distributing companies In this country arc subsidiaries, the necessary rise In the Gulf market can be brought about if they so desire, and the restriction policy referred to in paragraph 8 would facilitate this. 10.  .       Statement D contains some relevant information as to theprofits of the Anglo-American Oil Company and the Anglo-Persian Company.11.       The explanatory statement of the Oil Companies&apos;has been well received on the whole, both In yesterday&apos;s and to-day&apos;s press, and it Is generally accepted as a reasonable justification of the increase from a business standpoint.12., !?Jhile paragraph 3 of the Oil Companies&apos; statement explainsthe effect of the &quot;dumping&quot; of Russian supplies from April 1927 to February 1929, no mention is made, nor it has it been asked for, of the nature of the Agreement reached between the Oil Companies and the Russian Oil Interests.   According to press Information, Sir Henri Deterding explained, at a meeting of the international groupmof Russian Oil Companies in Paris on the 18th March, that with regard to the compensation of former owners of Russian oil wells the 5 per cent, rebate on the market price allowed by the Soviet under the new Agreement will mean a compensation of  50,000 annually during the three years of the Agreement.   This amount, will be distributed pro rata   among
the&apos; former owners of Russian wells.   The Soviet have been informed about this rebate arrangement, but the clause was not Incorporated in the text of the agreement.   Sir Henri Deterding. in statements to press representatives, contends that the Soviet have acknow-ledged the principle of compensation.   The President of the Russian Naphtha Syndicate, on the other hand, declares that the completion of the contract was rendered possible by Sir Henry Deterding&apos;s abandonment of his previous demands for the compensa-tion of former owners of Russian oilfields.   As a result of paragraph 3 of the Oil Companies&apos; statement the Government will undoubtedly be asked for Information about this agreement.It is not  p-proposed to ask the Oil Companies to give particu-lars of their agreement with the Russians.    If the rise in price is justified on economic grounds the Russian agreement does not vitiate the nil Gompanles case.    If the rise is rot justified economically the Russian agreement cannot excuse It.A table is attached (Statement C) showing the imports of Russian Motor Spirit and kerosene for the last six years. The percentage of Russian spirit to total U.K. consumption has increased from 1.06 per cent, in 1923 to 8.35.^ in 1928, but touched its highest figure of 9.85 per cent, in 1926; while kerosene w^s 3.65 per cent, in 1923 and 6.62 per cent, in 1928, with a highest figure of 9.63 per cent, in 1925,-SUMMARY.lo The figures, so far as they can be checked,&apos;arecorrect.
me Anglo-American and Shell Mex Companies are justified in taking Gulf wholesale prices as the standard on which to build up their retail price.The Anglo Persian have no option but to work in conjunction with the other distributing companies.While the Companies have justified the present increase, no further increase could be satisfactorily explained unless Gulf prices rise, but it is within the power of the distributing companies, working through their parent companies, to bring about such a rise if they so desire,Mo Information is given about the Companies as to the details of agreement with the Russian oil producers.    It is suggested that the terms of the agreement are not relevant to the present issue, and it is not proposed to Inquire officially as to the terms.

Statement B.Treasury, Whitehall, S.W. May 20,   1914 . Gent lemen,With reference to the Financial Agreement which has been duly settled on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government and sent to your Company for slgoaburev   I am directed by the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty&apos;s Treasury to offer the following observations regarding the provisions of the amendments proposed to your Articles of Association1.     By the new Article 91 A it is provided that an ex officio Director shall have the right to negative any resolution which may be proposed at a Board or Committee Meeting, but that the other Directors,  or a majority of them,  shall have the right to appeal therefrom to His Majesty&apos;s Government, which, for the purpose of the Article,  is defined as meaning the Treasury and the Admiralty.     His Majesty&apos;s Government are of opinion tnat i&apos;s would not be prudent,  or indeed, practicable, to. qualify the generality of the right of veto.      On the other hand,  It  Is felt that the ordinary Directors (meaning by that expression the Directors other than the ex officio Directors), and Incidentally the members of the Company, should have some safeguard in the matter.      It Is thought that the right which  &apos; is to be given by the new Article to the ordinary Directors of appealing to the two Departments will afford the requisite safeguard.     The ordinary Directors will, by appealing to the Departments, be in a position to ensure In regard to any particular question that the right of veto is not exercised un-til the question has been considered and adjudicated upon by the De pa department s,I am to add that His Majesty&apos;s Government do not propose to make use of the right of veto except in regard to matters of general policy, such as -(1)    The supervision of the activities of the Company as they may affect questions of foreign naval or military policy(2)    Any proposed sale of the Company&apos;s undertaking or proposed change of the Company1 s status;(3)    The control of new exploitation, sites of wells, &amp;c;(4)    SaJeg of crude or fuel oil to foreigners, or suchexceptional sales to other persons on long contracts as might endanger the due fulfilment of current Admiralty contract s;and that their Interference (if any)  in the ordinary administra-tiOD. of the Company as a commercial concern will be strictly limited to the minimum necessary to secure these objects. Furtiier in the case of any such interference, due regard will be paid to the financial interests of the Company in which, under the proposed arrangement, the Government have themselves so large a stake.While His Majesty&apos;s Government are not prepared to enter into any binding agreement in regard to the exercise of the veto you are at liberty to treat the above as an assurance as to the general lines upon which they will act  in the matter, not only in regard to the Anglo-.-Parsian Company (Limited), but also in regard to the subsidiary Companies.2.     By the words added to Article 96 it  is provided that the ex officio Directors shall be members of every Committee of the Board.      His Majesty&apos;s Government do not, however,  contemplatesCOFY/DL
cj -j &apos;x.that both the ex officio Directors should alweys be present at Committee meetings,      Occasions may arise when it may be desirable that both the ex officio Directors should be present, but as a general rule the presence of only one of them would be necessary-      ludead, at some meetings it may not be necessary that either of them should be present.3,     You are at liberty to make such use of this letter as you may think fit at the proposed meetings of the shareholders.I am, Gentlemen,Your obedient Servant,(Signed ) .
