IS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY fS GOVERNMENT.&apos;1&apos;COPY NO.2 8CAB I NET.MINING SUBSIDENCE.Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.I circulate the report of the Inter Departmental Committee which the Cabinet agreed (Cabinet 56(27) ConcP.3) should be set up to consider the recommendations of the Royal Commission on Mining Subsidence,  and a covering note by the Secretary for Mines.As regards Items (1)  (?)  (3)   (4)  (7) and (8), the Committee reach conclusions with which I agree.As regards Items  (5)  (6) and (9) the Committee considered that these raised questions of policy on which they could not usefully express an opinion, and they have confined themselves therefore to stating the objects of the recommendations made and the difficulties of adopting them.     These are the three recommendations which are particularly referred to in the note by the Secretary for Mines.     My own views upon them are that the endorsement of conveyances  (No.5) is impracticable;    that the abrogation of the decision in Buchanan and Andrew (No.6) -should be specially considered by the Secretary for Scotland;iand that the relief for &quot;small&quot; property ox?ners  (No.9) must be rejected.As regards No. 6, the Committee state that in England and -ales the tenant could obtain relief in the Courts from such an onerous contract (under, I believe, Section 146, Sub-section 5 of the Law of Property Act, 1925), but that In Scotland he could not.      If this is so, it seems reasonable that, when a suitable legislative opportunity occurs, provision should be made by
Act of Parliament to help the Scottish tenant.The most important of the Commission&apos;s recommendations is No. 9 - that all private owners or occupiers of existing houses of an annual value not exceeding  40 a year should he given a right to  compensation for damage from subsidence, on whatever terms their property was acquired. This is an extraordinary proposal and is full of defects and difficulties,     The Commission apparently wished to benefit only the &quot;small&quot; owner.     But all that they do is to limit the proposal to &quot;private owners or occupiers&quot;.   This excludes a local authority as owner, but not their tenant as occupier, even though the existing liability to repair is on the local authority;    nsr does it exclude any large property owner who Is not a public body.     There are other obvious objections - for instance,  that a man who has bought a damaged house at a correspondingly low price would no?; be able to have it repaired at the colliery&apos;s expense. But the most extraordinary feature of it is that the relief is to be for damage already done to existing houses and only for damage already done to existing houses .     Not only Is It retrospective, but it Is only, retrospective.     The Commission&apos;s reason,  I gather,  was that they thought that (with the assistance of the endorsements of title-deeds which they recommended) people should hereafter be more careful to ascertain their liabilities before acquiring a house, and also take steps  (by Town and Regional Planning and special methods of house-construction, as in recommendation No. 8) to avoid damage from subsidence. But the conclusions to which this has led them seem to me to be quite illogical and quite indefensible.     The position to-day is that,  vhere the terms of the relevant contracts allow it, a colliery owner has a right to let down the surface and damage surface buildings, and no blame attaches to him for exercising this right.     The
Commission have apparently come to the conclusion that, in respect of certain houses, this ought not to be.     But having reached this conclusion, they do not say that, now that it has been found to be a wrong thing to do, it shall not be done any more.     On the contrary they say that for the future - after it has been found to be wrong - it shall continue to be allowed, but that in the past - ^whilst it was not a wrong thing to do - it shall be penalised.I do not think that any Government could adopt such an inversion of logical reasoning.I would much prefer to make it an implied term of every future mineral lease or conveyance that the colliery owner should be liable to repair any &quot;small&quot; houses that he damaged by subsidence, provided that it could be done in a way which would not discourage care in selecting building sites and constructing houses in mining areas.The only action which would result from the adoption of the views which I have expressed on the various parts of this report would be as follows:-(a) To publish the Mining Association^ undertaking to give Information about colliery workings.(b) Subject to the views of the Secretary for Scotland,to introduce legislation to deal with&apos; the decision in Buchanan and Andrew.(c) To introduce legislation to enable &quot;small&quot; property owners to enforce claims arising out of subsidence in the County Court.(d) To extend Section 157 of the Public Health Act 1875in order to provide further supervision over building in mining areas.In each case the action need not be taken until a suitable opportunity arises.I do not wish to make any statement on the Royal Commission^ Report, unless I am pressed to do so.      I should much prefer to let sleeping dogs lie, and they seem fairly quiet at present.     But the Commission reported in
1927; and I think we must be reedy to give our considered judgment if called on to do so.      I, therefore, ask the Cabinet to approve this Memorandum, on the understanding that the Government^ decisions will not be made public, until we are questioned.P. C-L.Board of Trade18th March,  1929.
The President.In forwarding the report of the Inter-Departmental Committee on the recommendations made by the Royal Commission on Mining Subsidence, I should like to comment on one or two points with which the Committee did not consider that it would be proper for them to deal.The three contentious recommendations are those respecting the endorsement of conveyances, the partial abrogation of the House of Lords decision in the case of Buchanan v. Andrew, and the grant by statute of a right to compensation for damage due to mining subsidence in the case of houses of an annual value not exceeding  40.In each of these cases the Committee have confined themselves In their report to setting out. as far as they are able, the reasons which influenced the members of the Commission in making the recommendation and the objections that may be urged against it.Whether or not these proposals should be accepted is a question of policy which the Committee felt was for the Government to decide.     The Commission was set up as the result of an agitation on behalf of small property owners and although local authorities and public utility undertakings tried to take advantage of its existence to secure something for themselves, the more important recommendations made were principally directed to relieving the position of private owners of small dwelling houses.The Commission were apparently rather astonished at the small number of cases of damage which they were able to discover in which no remedy existed, and If the figures given in their Report and quoted at the end of the attached report are to be regarded as typical, the grievance must be regarded as one of inability to secure
0 r*i &apos;1compensation rather than the absence of a right to it.The objections to the proposal for the endorsement of conveyances are mainly administrative, and here the question for decision is whether it  is worth   while altering the conveyancing system In England and Scotland,  in a manner which Is contrary to the tendency of recent legislation, in order to secure what Is regarded by the Commission as a benefit, but by lawyers like Sir B. Cherry and Sir Claud Schuster as a very doubtful one and certainly as an inconvenient innovation.In the case of Buchanan v. Andrew the question is whether it is worth while to interfere by statute with a decision of the Bouse of Lords which has stood for 55 years without, so far as can be ascertained,  causing any widespread difficulties.     All that the Royal Commission say on the latter point Is that it &quot;has never been cheerfully accepted In Scotland;    it continues to rankle and it was frequently referred to before us in terms of disapprobation&quot;.It is quite clear that the Mining Association are strongly opposed to the proposal to grant a right to com-pensation to the small property owner, and it is clear that any additional burden placed on the mining Industry at the present time must tend to delay the recovery of the industry. It may be argued that the burden involved by the Commission^ recommendation would not be a large one.     Even so, any additional burden, however small, must have some effect, and the argument that the burden would be small is equally an argument that the grievance to be remedied is small also.As stated In the Committee&apos;s report, legislation on this point would without doubt be controversial, while those who stand to.gain,  or think they do, from the proposals of the Commission would resent an announcement that nothing
will be done.     At the same time, there is some ground for doubting whether, if effect were given to the whole of the Commissions recommendations, the hopes and expecta-tions of the expectant beneficiaries would be realised. This can only be a subject for speculation, but it may be noted that one cf the principal grievances of the most persistent of the associations of property owners is the amount which it cost them on one occasion to win a case against a colliery company for damage from subsidence. This might be met by the proposal to allow claims to be heard in the County Court.It is possible that the grievances which most closely affect those concerned might be met by the written assurance given by the Mining Association that their members will supply information in regard to underground workings to those whose surface rights are affected and by legislation to allow claims for comparatively small amounts to be heard in the County Court.      The latter would presumably have to wait until such time as a Bill to which it could suitably be attached was introduced, but if it is decided that the Innovation is justified an announcement to this effect could be made whenever it seemed desirable.(Signed)    H.

REPORT OF THE INTER-DEPARTMENTAL COMMITTEE ON THE REPORT OF THE ROYAL COMMISSION ON MINING SUBSIDENCE.Commodore H. D. King, C.B., C.B.E., D.S.O.,R.N.V.R., M.P. (Secretary for Mines).Mr. M.

ey r-i toREPORT OF THE ISTER-DEP/&apos;RTMENTAL COMMITTEE ON THE REPORT OF THE ROYAL COMMISSION ON MINING SUBSIDENCE.To the President of the Board of Trade.The royal Commission on Mining Subsidence, which included coal owners and miners among its members, wrs appointed in 1923 and, after holding 21 public meetings and visiting various coal-fields, reported in 19^-7.     The preparation of their report was delayed by the coal stoppage of 1926, but when completed was unanimous.The recommendations made by the Commission affected several Government Departments and in November, 1927, the Government decided to set up an Inter-Departmental Committee to consider the Report.Owing to the necessity of communicating with various interests concerned, it was not possible to make very rapid progress with the consideration of the problem, but we are now in a position to report on the questions set out in CP,269 (27) which was circulated in November, 1927The amount of subsidence could be minimised by the adoption of the most appropriate methods of mining, and &quot; he investigation of this subject by the BrltlsiTColllery Owners&apos; Research Association should be expedited.This recommendation does not call for any action other than that already taken by the Mines Department, who are keeping in touch with the Mining Association on this point.Up to the present, there are no developments to report.Part I. of the Mines (Working Facilities and Support) Act, 1923,&quot;&quot;should be amended so as to give to undertakings which rlave the benefit of the mining codes the same rights as are possessed by other property owners who have&quot; &apos;not&apos;the&apos;right to support to apply to the Railway and Canal Commission for an Order to prohibit or resTrict&quot; &quot;The working &quot;of minerals&apos;.tA new mining code such as is provided by Part II. of the Mines (frorkihg Facilities and Support) .Act. 1925,&apos; should be&quot; provided for other classes of undertakings&quot; which work under a mining code.The Ministry of Health have communicated with the various interests affected by (2) and it is clear that little Importance is attached to this recommendation by those whom it la intended to benefit.     The Mining Association, for their part, are opposed to the suggestion.We are of opinion that this question should be regarded as supplementary to the recommendation for the provision of a new mining code, and considered only if and when negotiations for the latter purpose are set on foot.
378 j soAs regards the second recommendation, the Royal Commission wished to see negotiations similar to those which took place between the Mining Association and the Railways and resulted in the agreement which was embodied in the Act of 1923. These negotiations,  in which only one interest was represented on either side, covered a period of years, and the Mining Association are unwilling to enter into similar negotiations with the Local Authorities and public utility undertakings which are still working under the old mining code.In the words used in evidence by Sir Ernest Cowers and adopted by the Commission in their report, the House of Lores9 decisions in the Hew Moss Colliery (1908) and Howley Park (1903) cases   remedied one absurdity but created another&quot; .     Where the law as laid down in these cases applied, the mine owners were placed in an impossible position, and the negotiations were set on foot in order to extricate them.As the Commission recommend ,;similar negotiations&quot;, the logical presumption Is that the result expected from such negotiations would be in the same broad direction.     But the Mining Association do not see any possible benefit to the Industry in the proposal and urge that the only object of the &quot;public&quot; undertakings would clearly be to get something more out of the mining Industry than they get at present, and that the industry is in no state to be^r any further burdens.     Such negotiations would, they say, take place under entirely different conditions from those which affected the negotiations with the railways.     The railway companies were in the position that they had to face subsidence problems in different districts under different circumstances, In some of which their claims might be good   and in others bad, so that the mine owners were able to negotiate a compromise.      In the case of waterworks, for example, the undertakings able to make a good case would naturally be unwilling to give away part of their case for the benefit of other undertakings less favourably situated and the striking of a bargain on a fair basis for the whole country would be impossible.The Ministry of Health communicated in May last with the Municipal Corporations Association and the other bodies concerned, but only two out of five (the Municipal Corporations Association and the Rural District Councils Association) have replied.In view of the objections urged by the Mining Association and of the apparent lack of Interest on the part of the other bodies affected, we recommend that no action should be taken on this question until such time as there is a definite demand for such negotiations.     When the necessity arises, the Mines Department,  in conjunction with the Ministry of Health and any other Government Departments concerned, might again approach the Mining Association and ascertain whether it is then possible to arrange for a meeting of the parties concerned.There should be compulsory disclosure of colliery under-ground plans for the purpose offacilltatihg&apos;Town &quot;Planning Schemes&quot; and other build inland  .2F..AS s**s ting small property owners In &apos;the&quot;prosecution of claims ; for compensation for damage from Subsidence&quot;&apos;.The Mining Association are strongly opposed to the compulsory disclosure of the actual plans, and this objection
has been recognised by statute to the extent that plans of abandoned mines deposited with the Mines Department are not open to public inspection for a period of years.We thought it well to ascertain whether it was possible to secure all that was necessary by agreement with the Mining Association, so as to avoid any necessity for legislation, and the Mines Department have now received a written assurance on behalf of the members of the Association that they will give to anyone genuinely interested in the surface any information as to the past, present and probable future working beneath the surface in which he is interested *which may reasonably be required.     This Includes Local Authorities interested in Town Planning and the owner of a house damaged by subsidence.We consider that this assurance is sufficient to meet the case.That conveyances of land, etc., not having a right of support should be endorsed accordingly by&apos;&quot; the Transferor -under penalty of liability for any damage that may occur.In considering this recommendation, we had the benefit of the advice of Sir   Benjamin Cherry.The Royal Commission were satisfied that very many small houses erected on unprotected sites In mining areas had been bought by miners and other industrial worvers without due appreciation of the subsidence risk involved.In order to ensure that in future every purchaser should be in no doubt as to his position, they suggested the endorsement of the conveyance in every case where no right of support was given, the object of an endorsement as opposed to a form of words in the body of the instrument being presumably to catch the eye of the layman.It would be possible to provide by legislation for the insertion of a form of words or to Impose an obligation to stamp or otherwise mark the agreement at the top of the first page, but in either case, the only effective penalty for failure to fulfil the obligation would be to put a personal liability on the vendor, which would only last until he died and his estate was wound up..A number of difficulties would arise in practice.     In the case of registered land, for example, the instrument does not matter very much.     The land would be registered less a right to support or compensation, to be mentioned in the Property Register, but difficulty in administration might arise from the fact that registration is effected by the grantee and not by the grantor.In Scotland the Actual deed is registered, and there, difficulty would arise from the fact that endorsement is unknown and that any form of stamping or otherwise marking a deed would be a complete Innovation and inconsistent with the system of conveyancing and registration now existing.Further, It should be noted that this proposal runs counter to the tendency of recent years to do everything possible to simplify the title to land by cutting cut unessentlals, as it would mean a new complication and would Introduce a doubtful point in almost every case.
The House of Lords&apos; decision In Buchanan v. Andrew (1873) should he abrogated by statute to the extent thjvb it should&quot;be made Impossible&quot;, notwithstanding anything&quot;in the grant, for a grantee to&apos; be compelled to bui&quot;1 d and jnjintaTn mwhere the rigEt o f support&quot; is wTtihheid&quot; &quot;By the grantor&apos; and damage from subsidence results.In this case a landowner in Scotland gave out a plot of ground by feu contract taking the grantee bound to build and maintain on the ground a house of a certain value.     At the same time, the grantor reserved the minerals with power to work them without any liability in respect of damage which the working might cause to the house which his grantee was bound to maintain.The Scottish Courts by what Mr. H.P. MacMillan,   K.C., in the course of his evidence before the Royal Commission, described as &quot;refinements of interpretation&quot; found in favour of the grantee, but the House of Lords who heard the case In 1873 reversed this decision on the ground that the intention of the contracting parties        clear, and that it must be assumed that the risk w?s taken into account when the terms of the bargain were settled between them.This decision of the House of Lords applies equally, of course, in England and Wales, where instances can be found of land let on long leases with an obligation to build and maintain a house without any right on the part of the lessee to compensation for damage due to mineral working.     The position is not quite the same as in Scotland, however, as there are in this country means which do not exist in Scotland by which the tenant can get relief.The Royal Commission say that this decision &quot;has never been cheerfully accepted in Scotland, It continues to rankle and it was frequently referred to before us in terms of disapprobation&quot;.     They recommend that it should be varied by statute^, in the interests of the grantee, but it is not clear whether they intend such variation to be retrospective or to apply only to future contracts.The objection urged against the recommendation is that It Involves interference with a contract which has been freely made in circumstances in which Lord Chancellor Selborne, in his judgment, said that no Court could hold such a contract to be unreasonable, being made voluntarily and for valuable consideration.  *&quot;Small&quot; property owners having a right to support should be able to enforce their rights IrT the County&quot; Court, &quot;irrespective of the amount of their cTalmwhere the value of the hereditament does not exceed  700,We see no objection to the adoption of this proposal, which is not, however, of sufficient importance to warrant legislation by itself.When a suitable opportunity occurs of dealing with it in conjunction with other legislation, we would suggest that It might be well to adopt a limitation expressed as an annual value and not as a capital sum.
(8) Closer attention should be paid to the scientificlayout of the surface by Town and Regional Planning and to the special methods of constructing buildings] b&quot;y means of which, for a small additional cost, a cons&quot;id&quot;e rab&quot;le&quot;ITegree of immunity from damage by subsidence oan/Se obtained7As regards Town Planning, the only point which concerns this Committee appears to have been met.by the assurance given by the Mining Association as to the disclosure of information in connection with underground working.Building construction could mostly be dealt with by Looal Authorities&apos; byelaws.Section 157 of the Public Health Act, 1875, authorises such byelaws &quot;with respect to the structure of walls, foundations, roofs and chimneys of new buildings for (inter alia securing stability&quot;.     This power goes a good way, but it might be well that the first suitable opportunity should be taken to extend the power to make byelaws as to new buildings so as  (for example) to enable Local Authorities to limit the number of buildings in a row.(9) &quot;Small&quot; property owners who at present have no rightof support ofcompensatlon should be given by statute&quot; a right To compensation in the case of existing houses of an annual value not exceeding  40.This is the most important and far-reaching recommendation in the Commissions report.     After deciding that no case had been made out for granting a right to compensation for damage due to mining subsidence to Local Authorities, or to Public Utility Companies  (they afterwards express the same opinion as regards business premises) the Report goes on to consider the private house.The actual damage they found to be less widespread and less serious than they would have supposed was possible, and that even where it was specially serious (in South Wales) they found it difficult to ascertain what proportion represented damage In respect of which there was no right to compensation.They were satisfied, however, that very many small houses erected on unprotected sites in mining areas have been purchased by miners and other industrial workers without due appreciation of the subsidence risk involved.     That in such cases the buyer, since he had necessarily to live near his work, was not really a free agent, as he had not in the fullest sense freedom of choice, and that Justification existed, therefore, for legislative interference with such contracts.They desired to help the working man or minor official who was compelled by circumstances to live near his work, as opposed to those who were in a position to select any site within a wider area.     It was clearly impossible, however, to
have a particular house with a right to compensation for subsidence damage at one time and without such right at another simply through a change of ownership.     They there-fore recommended that &apos;&apos;private owners or occupiers of houses of an annual value not exceeding  .40 who at present have no right of support or right to compensation for damage caused by withdrawal of support through mineral working should have a right to compensation fur such damage accorded them&quot;.The small owner is to be able to enforce his rights in the County Court against anyone whom he can prove to have carried on, at any time, mining operations which were under or reasonably likely to affect the property in question, and the defendant is to be allowed to recover from any person whom he can show to have been in fact responsible for all or any of the damage.     The Report adds that it would be well that the Judge should on the application of the defendant, be required to apportion sny liability of the defendant as between himself and the owner of the minerals, having due regard to the terms of the mining lease.The Mining Association are strongly opposed to this proposal.     They urge that the industry oannot bear any further burdens, and that in any case the proposal Is unfair, as where the mine owner has a right to let down houses on the surface without paying compensation, he has in fact paid, or is paying, for that right in the price given for the right to work the minerals.They would continue to oppose the recommendation strongly even if they were given a right of recovery against the original owner of the surface, who in many cases could probably never be.found.That the suggested legislation would impose a burden on the industry is obvious, but it is impossible to form any reliable estimate of the size of the burden.      It was stated by experts who gave evidence before the Commission that in their experience the cost to a typical colliery company which was liable for damage caused by subsidence amounted to about Id. per ton of output or less.     It has also been urged that many colliery companies do in fact often repair houses although they are under no legal liability to do so, and that for these reasons the burden would not be serious.     To the second argument    the coal owners reply that it is one thing to send colliery workmen to do the necessary repairs but quite another thing to have to settle a bill for damages under a threat of legal proceedings.The first argument, that the burden would not be serious, is double-edged, since the smaller the burden that would, be imposed on the industry, the less serious must be the grievance which it is desired to remove.
It was mainly complaints of the hardship suffered by small owners of this class that led to the appointment of the Royal Commission and a few letters are still being received from local organisations representing property owners urging that legislative effect should be given to the recommendations of the report.    At the conference held in July this year by the National Federation of Property Owners and Ratepayers, which represents 180 loci   associations,  a resolution was passed to this effect which also asked all federated associations to canvas their local Member of Parliament.The question of subsidence was raised on one or two occasions in the House of Commons during the summer, but principally in connection with damage done to the property of local authorities.     On this point, the Royal Commission had decided that no case had been mrde out for the grant of a right to compensation.It would seem certain that legislation on the lines suggested would be decidedly controversial, while an announcement that no action was to be taken on the report would equally certainly arouse the indignation of those who are expecting to benefit from it.     How far these expectations would be satisfied by the less drastic recommendations, such as the hearing of cases in the County Court and the provisions of information as to underground working for the benefit of the surface owner, it is impossible to say.      If the figures given in evidence before the Commission and quoted in their report are typical of the country as a whole, the cases where no right to compensation exists are not very numerous.     The figures given were that out of 530 mining leases in v/ales which were examined, 500 made the mineral worker liable for all surface damage and 26 made him liable In respect of buildings existing on the date of the lease.      In the Yorkshire district It was estimated that 80 per cent, of the leases made the lessee liable for surface damage.Finally, we wish to record our high appreciation of the able and aealous service rendered to us throughout our study of the Report of the Royal Commission by our Secretary, Mr, G;H,  Pryor   to whom we are particularly indebted for Invaluable help in compiling the report now submitted.H.
