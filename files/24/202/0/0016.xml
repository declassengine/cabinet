999W l-J wDRAFT QUESTION AND ANSWER.jtion To ask the Secretary of State for the Colonies what action is contemplated, by the Government with regard to the recommendations of the Report of the recent Commission on Closer Union in East Africa (Cm&amp;.3234), and what machinery is proposed for giving effect to his undertaking that local opinion in East Africa will be consulted before any final commitments are entered into.ver She Report referred to embodies a statement of thegeneral principles which ought to govern the progressive application of what Is known as the Dual Policy i.e0 the comple-mentary development of the native and non-native communities, and the closer association of the immigrant communities domiciled in East Africa in the responsibilities and trusteeship of Government,    These general principles, In so far as they are consistent with the principles laid down in the White Papers of 1923 and 1927  (Cmdd922 and Cmd*2904), are fully accepted by His Majesty&apos;s Government as a valuable guide to future policy* The Report also put3 forward a number of important specific suggestionsj particularly as regards the powers and constitut-ional position of the proposed High Commissioner for the three territories of Kenya, Uganda and Tanganyika, and the future control, and direction of services common to those three terri-tories such as railways, customs and defence, which will require much further consideration, and with regard to which I am, in any case, pledged to afford full opportunity for the expression of   -local opinion.     Accordingly I propose to ask Sir Samuel Wilson, the Permanent Under Secretary of State at the Colonial Office, to proceed to East Africa as soon as possible with a view to his discussing the recommendations of the Commission, and such
possible modifications of their proposals for effecting the objects in view as may appear desirable9 with the Governments and with any bodies representing the various interests and communities In the three East African territories concerned, with a view to seeing how far it may be possible to find a basis of general agreement.Sir Samuel Wilson1s report on these consultations will not be available: before^e June at the earliest, and con-sequontly no question of further action in the lifetime of the present Parliament is likely to arise,.    But a3 far as this Government Is concerned I have already given an undertaking &apos; that no final decision will be taken until an opportunity has been afforded for Parliamentary dise-assistance &apos;JhioplementaryWill Sir Samel Wilson1s instructions allow of the reopening of the basis cf representation as between Europeans and Indians on the Zenya legislative Council?xsv/er.Ko, Sir.      I do not propose that Sir S- Wilson should discuss proposals which would re-open the basic principles inregard to Indian representation embodied in the White Paper of 19230^the.^Supplement ary.Poes the Government accent the view of the majority o  the Commission that there can be no question of responsible Government in these territories until the natives can share in the responsibility? uverThe policy of the Government in this matter Is set out In the two White Papers to which I have already referred.
9 9.1 6 (j 5Responsible Government Is not in question within any period of time vhich need now he taken Into consideration. We are prepared, however, as a part of a scheme of closer union, to consider a carefully guarded advance In the association of an unofficial clement in tho responsibilit-ios of trusteeships     Any future progress towards self-government must be loft to take the lines which the passage of time and the growth of experience may indicate 0
