REPORT.I.-INTRODUCTORY.(a.) Composition and Terms of Reference.On the 7th July, 1928, the Chairman of the Committee of Civil Research, appointed a Sub-Committee of the Committee of Civil Research with the following Terms of Reference: To examine the radium requirements of Great Britain in relation to the present sources of supply and to submit recommendations.2.   The Sub-Committee is constituted as follows :  The Right Hon. Lord Rayleigh, F.R.S. (Chairman). Sir   Sydney   Chapman,   K.C.B.,   C.B.E.,   Chief   Economic Adviser to His Majesty&apos;s Government.Mr. H. L. F. Fraser, Assistant Secretary, Department .ofHealth for Scotland. Sir Walter Fletcher, K.B.E., C.B., F.R.S., Secretary, medical research Council. Lt.-General Sir Webb Gillman, K.C.B., K.C.M.G., D.S.O.,Master-General of the Ordnance, War Office.Mr. J. F. N. Green, Assistant Secretary, Colonial Office.Mr.  M.  Heseltine,  OB.&quot;/ &quot;Assistant  Secretary, Ministry of Health. . /Sir Thomas Holland, K.C.S.I., K.C.I.E., F.R.S., Director,Geological Survey of India, 1903-1909. Sir George Newman, K.C.B., Chief Medical Officer, Ministryof Health.Sir Robert Robertson, K.B.E., F.R.S., Government Chemist. Sir Ernest Rutherford, O.M., President of the Royal Society. Mr. H. T. Tizard, C.B., F.R.S., Secretary, Department of Scientific and Industrial Research.Mr. A. F. Hemming, C.B.E., Assistant Secretary to the Committee of Civil Research (Secretary to the Sub-Committee).(b.) Procedure adopted by the Sub-Committee.3. At our first meeting which was held on the 10th July, 1928, we discussed the procedure to be adopted by us in our Inquiry.4. We decided in the first instance to obtain a preliminary survey of the possibility of obtaining supplies of radium from sources within the Emp:re. To this end we invited the Depart-. meht of Scientific and Industrial Research to obtain from the Geological Survey, the Imperial Institute, and other authorities in this country all available information regarding actual and potential sources of radium within the Empire. We further invited the Department to collect for us such information as has been published regarding the production of radium in the Belgian Congo and in Colorado. At a later date the Secretary of State for the Colonies, on our recommendation, informed the Governor of the Tanganyika Territory of our Inquiry, and asked him to obtain for us a preliminary report from the Geological Survey of his Territory. We further invited the Commonwealth Council for Scientific and Industrial Research to furnish us with all information at their[&quot;.18805]
disposal about the possibility of obtaining radium in commercial quantities in Australia. On this subject we also received oral evidence from Sir Douglas Mawson and Mr. A. Bowler. In addition, a witness gave us evidence on the possibility of radium deposits being detected in Northern Bhodesia.5. Oil the medical aspect of our Inquiry, which, by the terms of our reference, related to Great Britain only, we invited the Ministry of Health and the Scottish Department of Health to furnish us with statements showing, as regards England and Wales and Scotland respectively, the amount of radium under Government control available for use in medical treatment, the methods by which it is distributed, the extent to which full use is made of existing supplies, the estimated amount of radium in use for medical purposes not under Government control, and the estimated amount which, if available, could, in the opinion of-the respective Departments, be usefully employed for medical purposes. We further invited the Medical Besearch Council to furnish us with particulars of the distribution of the radium stocks placed at their disposal by the Government for research purposes.6. We also took appropriate steps to inform ourselves of the radium requirements of the Fighting Services. We also obtained information about the existing stocks of radium held by the Govern-nient for use in physical research.7. Our Chairman has visited the works of radium Beige at Oolen, and their laboratories at Brussels, and was allowed to examine fully the methods used there for treating the ore, refining the radium, and putting it into platinum containers for use. Our best thanks are due to Monsieur Sengier, the Managing Director, and Monsieur Le Chien, the Chief Chemical Engineer, for the generous manner in which they accorded information.8. In addition to the information received from the Depart-ments indicated above, we received.-a: mass of evidence, oral and written, from various sources. We -desire to place on record our indebtedness to all who have thus assisted us in our Inquiry.n. THE NEW IMPORTANCE OF radium IN medical treatment.9. Radium has long been used empirically for the treatment of cancer, but it is only in recent years that systematic studies of a comprehensive character have been undertaken in regard to its biological and curative properties. These studies have been largely carried out so far as this country is concerned at the various centres to which radium fractions have been lent by the Medical Research Council. The situation has been completely changed by the know-ledge and experience recently gained in this and other countries. Formerly little or no definite knowledge existed regarding the con-ditions in which treatment would be likely to prove beneficial, though inexpert use was known to be very dangerous. To-day technical methods have been elaborated for the treatment of cancer by radium of almost every region of the body except the stomach. Concur-rently with the development of these methods, there has been witnessed a transformation in the modes adopted for the application of radium, old modes having been greatly improved and many new ones devised. Much valuable knowledge has also been gained in regard to the important questions of the time of exposure, the quantity of radium to be employed, and the position to be selected for it, as functions of. dosage. It is not too much to say that as the value of radium has been progressively recognised, a new surgery, a &quot;surgery of access,&quot; has sprung into existence. We do not doubt that as further knowledge is obtained in regard to the possibilities of this radium-surgery, its use will develop rapidly, and in an increasing measure it will replace the use of the knife in tfce treatment of cancer.10. Of the various forms of cancer for which radium has been tried, none affords a more, striking, example than cancer of the womb.   The knowledge already gained makes it possible now
to assert categorically that a course of radium treatment will effect as successful a local removal of cancer of the neck of the womb as could be obtained by an operation. In the latest year for which we have received figures (1926), it appears that the number of women who died of this form of cancer was 4,409. There can be little doubt that if there had existed an adequate supply of radium in this country available for medical treatment, the lives of many of these women might have been prolonged, and much suffering avoided. The amount of radium available to-day is greater than it was in 1926, but, even so, it is quite inadequate even to cope with the most pressing needs. As long as this remains the case the country will have to face the reproach that a great volume of avoidable distress and suffering persists simply because the radium required for the treatment of cancer in various forms is not available. It is true that the amount of radium available is not the only condition for its successful use: and that there also exists to-day lamentable shortage of radium surgeons possessing the highest training, and a corresponding shortage of available hospital beds. We believo. however, that once an approximately adequate supply of radium is obtained, its value in the treatment of cancer will so quickly become apparent that the number of skilled operators will rapidly increase, and arrangements will be made by the hospitals for increasing the number of beds allotted to raaiuni-surgical cases.11. It is probable that the best radium practice in Great Britain is now as good as that in any country. It would, however, be a mistake, on this account, to conclude that in this matter Great Britain taken as a whole is ahead of, or even on a level with, all other countries. On the contrary, it must be admitted that Sweden and Prance hold a leading position, and have con-tributed more largely than has this country to the common stock of existing knowledge in regard to the treatment of cancer with radium. There is no doubt that this is due in large measure to the greater interest in the subject displayed by the Swedish and French Governments: In Sweden the use of radium is highly organised under Government auspices, and has been given a great impetus by the scheme inaugurated to celebrate the 70th birthday of the King of Sweden. In France the interest of the Government has been demonstrated by the establishment of fifteen radium centres distributed throughout France, by the allocation to these centres of 31-5 grammes (exclusive of approximately 20 grammes believed to be in the hands of institutions and private individuals), and by the provision of co-ordinating machinery through the Ministry of Health in Paris.III. EXISTING SUPPLY OF EADIUM AVAILABLE FOB MEDICAL TREATMENT IN GREAT BRITAIN AND THE METHODS ADOPTED FOR ITS DISTRIBUTION.(a.) Existing Government S^tp2)lies.12. The Medical Research Council hold the equivalent of approximately 2:4 grammes of radium element, .the property of the State. This quantity was recovered from surplus stores of war material, and since 1919 has been entrusted to the Council with a view .to the promotion of research into the methods of radium-therapy applicable to malignant disease and other conditions. Except as regards one small fraction of the radium, the research work involves the treatment of cases. The distribution of this supply is not restricted to England and Wales.13. The&apos;bulk of the radium under the control of the Medical Research Council is distributed on loan to hospitals which have submitted approved schemes of research in radium-therapy. One fraction has been allocated solely for experimental work. Some of the other fractions are used to some extent for this purpose, as well as for treatment. -14. An important fraction is retained centrally at the Middlesex Hospital as a source of supply of radium emanation (radon), the expenses of this Radon Centre being defrayed by a grant from the
British Empire Cancer Campaign. The emanation is issued to hospitals and research laboratories. The institutions entitled to supplies include those to which fractions of radium have been lent by the British Empire Cancer Campaign for research under the same general scheme.15. The present distribution of Government radium is as follows : Equivalent in grammes of Radium Element.England and Wales Middlesex Hospital, London   ......     0-1998Middlesex Hospital (supplement) (a) ca. -1263 University College Hospital, London... -1946 St.    Bartholomew^   Hospital,   Lon-don (I))       ............       -1623l ing&apos;s College Hospital, London     ...       -2615 London Hospital        ...      ...      ...       -0709St. Mark&apos;s Hospital, London (a) ca. ...       -0500St.    Marylebone    Infirmary,    Lon-don (a) ca.............       -0400London     Association     of     MedicalWomen&apos;s     Federation    .

Estimated Amount of Radium, the Property of Institutions or Private Medical Practitioners, now in use for Medical Purposes.(i.) England and Wales.17. It is difficult, if not impossible, to form an accurate estimate of the amount of radium belonging to Institutions and private medical practitioners at present available for use for medical purposes. We have not been able to undertake a systematic inquiry into the whole subject. Such information as we have been able to gather is derived through the Ministry of Health from an inquiry in the large County Boroughs (including most of the provincial medical University towns) represented on a Sub-Committee of the Departmental Committee on Cancer of the Ministry of Health.   We have also obtained a certain amountNote.

of additional information from published Reports and similar sources.18. The information collected is, however, incomplete in at least three ways, viz. : (a.) Hospitals possessing a certain quantity of radium may buy or be given an additional amount in the interval between the publication of two successive annual reports.(6.) It is possible that some hospitals possess radium of which we have failed to obtain information, e.g., some of the large London Hospitals which, according to published information either possess no radium or only very small quantities.(c.) Some medical practitioners have private stocks of which we have no information.19. We have summarised in the following table the informa-tion which we have been able to gather in regard to radium stocks (exclusive of loans from the Government) held by hospitals in England and Wales, including under this term the Radium Institutes in London and Manchester. We have grouped the available information to show the amount of radium held in each town where there is a hospital possessing radium. In the first column (Column A) we give the amount of radium which we believe is actually in the possession of the various Hospitals, &amp;c, at the present time. In Column B we give an estimate of the additional amounts of radium which will also almost certainly be available within the next three months. The latter figures have been obtained by taking recently published statement of gifts of money to various hospitals for the purchase of radium, and by converting them into terms of radium element at the conservative figure of  12,000 per gramme of element.(Grammes of Radium Element.)Town.

Scotland.20. For the reasons indicated in the case of England and Wales, it is not possible to form more than an approximate estimate of the amount of radium in the hands of institutions and jirivate medical practitioners in Scotland.21. Subject to the foregoing qualifications we estimate the existing private radium stocks in Scotland as follows : Grammes of Radium Element.Dundee ...      ......       -136Edinburgh     ...       ...       ...       -200Glasgow......      ...       -8001-136
22. In addition to the above amounts, gifts of money recently announced should shortly increase the stock in Glasgow by another gramme, thus raising the total private stocks in Scotland to 2-186 grammes of radium element.23. The only other centre in Scotland in which radium is known to be in use is Aberdeen, the radium at which is part of the Government stock lent by the Medical Research Council.(c.) The Extent to which Full Use is made of the Existing Supply.24. Radium can be said to be fully used only when it is con-stantly in application, i.e., transferred with as little delay as possible from one patient to the next. As the type of applicator and the quantity of radium used vary with the organ under treat-ment, it is apparent that there should be a sufficient series of patients with the same disease available at the Institution where the radium is applied if the fullest use of the material is to be secured. Naturally such conditions are seldom found in general hospitals admitting cases of all types. Even where arrangements are made by which a group of hospitals shares the use of the radium prepared in the particular way necessary for the kind of case under treatment, there must inevitably be some loss of time during transit from one hospital to another. It is, we under-stand, to minimise this kind of loss that the Cancer Research Committee of the London Association of the Medical Women&apos;s Federation have now decided to concentrate as far as possible in a &apos; single centre the radium treatment of cancer of the womb.25. It will be apparent from the foregoing considerations that if the most economical use is to be made of the radium available in any area radium treatment within that area should be con-centrated as far as circumstances permit in specialised centres.26. In general, therefore, it may be said that, in so far as radium is used elsewhere than in a specialised centre, such as a radium institute, it is not being used to its fullest extent. Even in such an institute it cannot be used fully unless the supply of patients affected in the particular organs suited to radium treat-ment is adequate. This condition will not be satisfied unless the institute is sufficiently large to enable it to provide the number of beds required.27. In existing circumstances it would only be possible to calculate the extent to which full use is made of existing supplies by working out for each hospital using radium the average period during which known quantities of. radium were employed, in proportion to the total period for which it was available. At the Metropolitan Asylums Board centre for the treatment of cancer of the womb by radium, we are informed by the Ministry of Health that they calculate that, if there was a steady flow of patients, the radium might be in use for about 70 per cent, of the available time.28. Moreover, however complete may be the arrangements made to ensure the fullest possible use of the supplies of radium available, there must always be some waste of radiation. The larger, therefore,&quot;the number of institutions among which a given quantity is distributed, the greater must be the waste involved.IV. AMOUNT OF RADIUM AT PRESENT REQUIRED FOR MEDIC A L PURPOSES IN ENGLAND, SCOTLAND AND WALES.29. We have shown in Section III that the existing Govern-ment stocks of radium available for medical purposes in Great Britain amount to 2-191 grammes, excluding a fraction of 0&apos;2212 gramme lent to the Irish Free State. On the basis explained in that Section, we estimate that the amount now in the possession of, or shortly to be acquired by, medical institutions or private practitioners is approximately 22-7 grammes.   The total available
from all sources in Great Britain is therefore approximately 24:9 grammes. Of this amount, 227 grammes are distributed very unevenly .over England and Wales, and 22 grammes are held in Scotland.30. In view of the rapid and continuing progress in the develop-ment of radium-surgery, it is impossible to form a definite estimate of the amount of radium required or likely to be required in the near future for medical purposes in this country. The following considerations may, however, be of some value as indicating the measure of the present shortage of supply.31. In England and Wales, excluding the Beit Gift (say, 4 grammes), the future distribution of which is not at present known, the total stocks, governmental and private, of which we have knowledge, amount to approximately T8&quot;7 grammes, of which 12&quot;6 grammes are in London and 6&apos;1 grammes are distributed in the provinces. It would no doubt be misleading to adopt for purposes of calculation a population basis, as many cases from the provinces are now treated with radium in London, and, even supposing that the provincial supplies were greatly increased, a certain number of provincial cases would certainly continue to be sent to London. Assuming for the moment that the present supply of roughly 12 grammes is enough for London, with a population of, say, 8 millions, it can hardly be questioned that at least twice that amount is required by the provinces for a population of &apos;say) 80 millions. On this basis the present radium requirements of England and Wales would be 36 grammes, as compared with the existing supply of 18&apos;7, or, say, about 21 grammes, if allowance be made for the probable share of England and Wales of the radium to be acquired from the Beit Gift. In other words, there is a present shortage of at least 15 grammes. This calculation taken by itself would, however, be quite misleading. In the first place, it assumes that the present radium requirements of the London hospitals are adequately met by the existing supply. We are satis-fied that this is not the case. Further, no allowance is made for the fact that full advantage is not yet taken in all the London Hospitals of the latest developments of radium-surgery. Finally, the calcula-tion assumes requirements are in a static condition, whereas everything points to the probability that what is a sufficient supply of radium to-day would be an inadequate supply in a year&apos;s time. For these reasons we think that 20 grammes would be a conservative estimate of the present radium deficit in England and Wales.32. As regards Scotland, the Department of Health for Scotland estimate that 4 grammes of radium distributed between Edinburgh, Glasgow, Dundee and Aberdeen could be immediately absorbed for medical purposes. This, with the existing stocks (Governmental and private), would give a figure of about 6-2 grammes as the amount of radium that could at present be usefully employed in Scotland.33. On the basis of the foregoing calculations the total radium requirements of England, Scotland and Wales amount to 48-9 grammes. The amount that would be required to be bought to bring existing stocks of all kinds up to this figure would be 24 grammes.34. We realise that the expenditure involved in acquiring so large a quantity would be very substantial, although for so large a purchase the actual cost per gramme would no doubt be substantially less than the present market price. Moreover, as we have already stated, great difficulties would be experienced in finding adequate numbers either of surgeons trained in radium-therapy or of hospital beds if very large additions were made immediately to the existing radium supplies. For these reasons we recommend that a programme should be adopted aiming at securing a net increase of 20 grammes of radium to be available for medical purposes bv the end of 1930. Purchases on this scale would, we believe, go far to meet the present urgent needs, and at the same time would give sufficient opportunity for the necessary adjustments to be made by the Hospitals for the provision of adequate numbers of trained staff and of beds available for the treatment of cancer with radium.[18895]
V.-OTHEE  GOVERNMENT  RADIUM   SUPPLIES AND REQUIREMENTS.(a.) Fighting Services.35. In the late war the Fighting Services used radium in appreciable quantities mainly for the illumination of gun-sights and compass cards. Some of this radium was recovered after the war and formed the initial stock placed at the disposal of the Medical Research Council (see paragraph 12),36. The peace time radium requirements of the Fighting Services are very small, the annual purchases by the three Services only amounting to approximately 0-345 grammes of radium element. In these circumstances, we think that the present arrangements by which the Services purchase direct the small quantities that they require should be retained. It would, in our view, be a mistake to insist that radium for the Fighting Services be bought through any central agency that may be established which should, we consider, be confined to purchasing the amount required from time to time for medical purposes.(b.) Physical Research.37. The Department of Scientific and Industrial Research have at their disposal one gramme of radium element. This radium is used under arrangements made by the Department at the National Physical Laboratory, Teddington, and elsewhere, in connection with research on various physical problems.38. We consider that if at any time it was decided to increase the amount of radium devoted to these purposes it should be acquired independently of any central agency that may be established for medical purposes. There are, however, certain by-products, e.g., polonium, which are obtainable from old radium when it is made up anew. These are not of any medical utility though much in demand for physical research, and any central agency established for medical purposes should be entitled to allocate them for that purpose.VI.-THE SOURCES OF RADIUM PRODUCTION, (a.) Total Radium Production.39. It is difficult to form a reliable estimate of the world&apos;s total production of radium since its discovery up to the present time. The following Table published by the United States Bureau of Mines (Mineral Besources, 1926, p. 268), is, however, sufficient to give a substantially accurate general idea of the main sources of radium production as known in 1926 : Grammes of Radium (Clement;United States ... ... ... 250Belgian Congo ... ... ... 180Czecho-Slovakia ... ... ... 42Portugal       ... ... ... ... 15Madagascar   ... ...... ... 8Russia         ... ... ... ... 6Cornwall      ... ... ... ... 4South Australia ... ... ... 1Total............      506This table is necessarily incomplete, and in particular there is no doubt that the figures for Cornwall are too low.40. At the present time very little radium is being produced anywhere except in Belgium, where the Belgian Congo ore is treated; and there 30 or 40 grammes of radium element were produced in 1928, according to information given by Monsieur Sengier to our Chairman. This approximately represents the world&apos;s present consumption per annum. Recent developments in medical science are, however, likely materially to increase this consumption.   The
American Carnotite ores rank second in importance as a potential source of radium, but extraction of radium from Carnotite by the usual methods is not profitable at the present price. The United States Bureau of Mines has, however, recently developed a modified nitric acid process for the treatment of Carnotite, by which it is claimed that exceptionally high extraction and recovery of both radium and vanadium may be obtained even from comparatively low-grade ores, at costs considerably lower than those of existing processes.   (U.S. Bureau of Mines, Serial No. 2873, May 1928.)(b.) Deposits in the British Empire. (i.) Great Britain.41. radium has been produced in the past in a number of mines in Cornwall. In none of these mines, however, has there been continuous production of radium. The commercial value of mines containing low grade ores, such as those found in Cornwall, has been severely affected by the discovery in 1913 of much richer deposits in the Belgian Congo. From such information as we have been able to gather, we think it improbable that any of the Cornish ores are sufficiently abundant to enable radium to be extracted from them in commercial quantities in competition with the ores from the Belgian Congo.(ii.) Canada.42. Uraninite, euxenite-polyerase and allanite have been found in Ontario in the neighbourhood of the Parry Sound, Buttownship, Hastings, Craigmont, Maberly, Opeonge Lake and Aylen Lake districts. It is generally true to say that the radio-active minerals occur in a widely disseminated condition in the pegmatites now worked for felspar. It is possible that recovery of these minerals might be carried on as a process subsidiary to the production of ground felspar. Hitherto, the rare minerals have not been saved.(Canada geol.. Surv. Summary Report, 1921, Part D.) (Canada geol.. Snrv. Summary Report, 1923, Part C.I.)(iii.) Australia.43. South Australia. Deposits of torbernite and autunite, associated with manganiferous iron ore and smaller quantities of Carnotite, uranophane, gummite, fergusonite, ilmenite and monazite, occur in the districts about Mt. Painter and radium Bidge. The Mt. Painter workings are difficult of access. According to the views put before us on behalf of the proprietors up till a few weeks from the date of the Report, the dressed ore which it was hoped to obtain from Mount Painter appeared to-be little if at all richer than the American Carnotite ore, containing 3 per cent, uranium oxide, the working of which has been abandoned in face of the Belgian competition; and we had no definite reason for thinking the ore would be more easily won. Quite recently, within the last two or three weeks it has been claimed that considerable quantities of much richer ore are in sight, but independent expert reports upon the validity of this-, claim are not yet in our hands, so that we are unable to express any opinion on it. The nature of these claims has been communicated to the Government of South Australia. In addition we understand that the question of the radium resources of Australia is engaging the attention of the Commonwealth Council of Scientific and Industrial Besearch.44. The deposits, mainly consisting of ilmenite at radium Bidge, near Olary, are more accessible than those at Mount Painter, but they are of low grade. We are informed that these deposits are now being worked for titanium and that arrangements have been made for the treatment of such radium ores as may be found in the course of working.(Industrial Australian, 1926, LXXV, 37, 725; 1926, IxxyI, 97, 321; 1927, lxxviil, 552; 1928, lxxix, 155.)(Mining Review S.

45. West Australia. Mackintoshite, thorogummite and pilbarite occur in a pegmatite dyke at Woodgina, and occurrences of fergusonite and euxenite have been reported at Cooglegong. We understand that it is unlikely that any considerable production can be expected from this source.(Western Australia geol.. Surv. Bull. 48.) (Western Australia geol.. Surv. Bull. 59.)46. New south Wales. The State Geologist reports that autunite and torbenite have been found at Carcoar. We understand, however, that only a few isolated specimens of these minerals have so far been found in this State.(New S. Wales Bee. geol.. Surv., 1916, Ix, 131.)(iv.) Union of South Africa.47. Small quantities of pitchblende occur in the concentrates from the Rand gold ores. It is stated (February 1927) that promising deposits of pitch blende have been found in the Northern Transvaal.   No details are, however, available.(S.A. Mining and Engineering Journal, 1927, xxxyII, 654.)48. In the Cape Province a Company has been formed for the exploitation of radio-active deposits discovered in May 1927 on the Farms Boksput, Walbrand and Biemvasmak in the district of Gordonia. A favourable report was published (January 1928) by the Company&apos;s consulting geologist on the radium content of samples submitted for examination from this field.(S.A. Mining and Engineering Journal, 1928, xxxvili, 437.) (Industrial Australian, 1928, lxxlx, 330.)(v.) India and Ceylon.49. Pitchblende occurs embedded in muscovite in pegmatite veins in the Gaya district of Bihar. In 1913 6 cwt. were produced as a by-product of mica mining, and in 1914, 16 lbs., but no returns have been made since that date. Several hundredweights of samarskite have been produced from the Sankara mine, Madras, and many other occurrences of radio-active minerals are known, but none of commercial importance as a source of radium. Thorianite and other radio-active minerals occur in Ceylon, but they are believed to have no commercial significance.(Bee. geol.. Surv. India, 1914, xlly, 31.) (Bee. geol.. Surv. India, 1919, 1, 255.)(vi.) The Tanganyika Territory.    (Mandated Territory.)50. Badio-active minerals have been found associated with muscovite in the pegmatites of the LTuguru Mts. and Lukwangule Hills and masses of pitchblende weighing as much as 70 lbs. are stated to have been found as isolated aggregates in the pegmatite veins.(vii.) Northern Rhodesia.51. No radio-active minerals are at present known to occur in Northern Bhodesia, but it is possible that further surveying may bring to light their existence in the region adjoining the frontier of the Belgian Congo.(c.) Deposits in Foreign Countries.52. Important deposits of radio-active ores are found in the Belgian Congo, the United States of America, Madagascar, Portugal, Czecho-Slovakia, Turkestan, and elsewhere in Bussia and in France.(i.) Belgian Congo.58. In 1918 a small piece of uranium ore was found in the copper mines of the Union Miniere du Haut-Katanga at Luiswishi and this led ultimately to the discovery of rich deposits. Later discoveries were made at Chinkolobwe near Elizabethville, and the Katanga deposits are now the chief source of supply of radio-active
ores. The ore consists of oxidisation products of pitchblende, with a smaller amount of the unaltered mineral, and contains up to 60 per cent, uranium oxide. The ore is shipped to Dolen in Belgium, where it is worked up by a subsidiary company, the societe Generale Metallurgique de Hoboken. The report of the Union Miniere du Haut-Katanga says that for the year ended the 12th July, 1926, 20 grammes of radium were marketed.(E. Sengier, Mining Mag., 1923, xxvill, 333.) (A. Schoep, Chimie et Industrie, 1923, x, 167.)(C. Matignon and G. Marchal, Chimie et Industrie, 1925, xiY, 344.) (H. W. Turner, Mining Mag., 1926, xxxiv, 200.)54. Our Chairman has visited the works at Oolen, and has convinced himself that, contrary to statements that have been made, there is no large reserve of ore there. He was shown the stock, amounting to about 50 tons; and was told that if the factory was not always in full activity, that was because the ore did not come in fast enough.Monsieur Sengier, the Managing Director, added that there was not an unlimited amount of ore in view. It was true that it had originally appeared so at a time (1918) when 150 grammes appeared an unlimited supply. More than 150 grammes had been sold altogether by the Company, including 30 or 40 grammes in 1928. This naturally altered the point of view. Originally the ore was so rich that 10 tons would produce a gramme of radium. Now, less rich ore had to be used, and about 30 or 40 tons of hand-picked ore, as shipped, were necessary to produce 1 gramme. Prospecting was in progress, but the result would not be known for six months or a year. If it was abortive, a shortage of supply would have to be contemplated eventually.(ii.) The United States.55. Prior to the discovery of the Colorado and Utah deposits of earnotite, pitchblende was produced in several localities in the United States, but chiefly in Gilpin Co., Colorado. The Carnotite deposits (2-3 per cent. U30s) of Colorado and Utah are of much greater economic importance, and constituted the chief source of supply of radium until 1923, when the development of the Belgian Congo deposits caused almost complete cessation of production elsewhere.Production of radium for the period 1917-23 is as follows: 	Grammes of	Radium Element.1917......	......      11-9601918......	......     21-7001919......	......     28-6481920  ......	......     32-5391921   .......	......     35-6931922  ......	......     24-1891923  ......	......     12-21256. In addition, some ore was shipped and worked up in Europe. Since 1923 mining has been limited to the getting of a few tons of rich (7 per cent. TJ3Os) Carnotite for special purposes. During 1926 no radium is known to have been isolated from ore mined or shipped during the year, but the United States radium Corporation, New York, produced a quantity at its reduction plant at Orange, New Jersey.(Mineral Resources of the United States, 1926 (Annual Publication.) ) (H.

(iii.) Czechoslovakia.-57. The mines at Jachymov (formerly St. Joachimstal, Bohemia) have produced uranium minerals for over 30 years. The ore consists of pitchblende occurring in mica schist, and is associated with calcite, dolomite and quartz in veins which are 6 in. to 24 inches in width, and which also contain silver, arsenic, bismuth, cobalt, nickel and lead minerals. From 1909 to 1922, 24-7 grammes of radium was produced, but production has been seriously affected by the Belgian Congo developments. The mines are stated to be still working, but the latest production figures are those for 1925, when T200 gramme of radium are reported.58. The mines are Government property and exportation of the mineral is forbidden.(U.S. Comm. Eep. 1924.)(Matignon, C. and Marchal, G. : L&quot;Industrie des Corps Radio-actifs Chim. Ind., 1925, xiv, 343.)(iv.) France.59. No radium ores are found in France, but betafite is imported from Madagascar and pitchblende from Portugal. At one time torbernite was imported from French Indo-China, and Carnotite ores from the United States. There are two works in France for the extraction of radium.(v.) Portugal.60. Autunite is found in decomposed pegmatite veins in the Maceira-Guarda region and has been worked for many years. No uranium ore was produced in 1926, but 240 metric tons were produced in 1925 and concentrated in Portugal. Part of the concentrates wa6 treated in Portugal, where 0-875 gramme of radium was isolated. The remainder, 180 kilogrammes, containing 0-360 gramme of radium, was shipped to France. A stock of about 1,600 metric tons of vein material, carrying 0-5 to 0-7 per cent, uranium oxide (U30s) is believed to be available. Despite the low grade of the ore, recovery is easy.(Segaud and Humery:  Les Gisements d&apos;Uranium du Portugal:   Ann Mines, Memoires, 1913, iii, 111.)(Duparc, L. : Sur les filons et les minerals radio-actifs d&apos;Urane du Portugal: Arch. sci. phys. 1923, v, 79.)(vi.) Russia.61. Although uraninite has been found in the pegmatites of Karelia, Bussia has no known European uranium deposits of economic importance. There are, however, considerable deposits of tyuyamunite, the- lime Carnotite, in the Tyuya Muyun Mts. of Ferghana, Bussian Turkestan, and uranium-vanadium ores have been found further west in the Minusinsk District of Yenisei. In 1922 the State radium Institute reported the amount of ore. in existing workings to be 5,000 tons, estimated to contain 15 to 20 grammes of radium. The radium actually isolated from these ores is believed not to exceed 2-0 grammes.(Chii-vinsky, P. N. : Tyuyamunite from the Tyuya Muyun Radium Mine in Ferghana:  Mineral Mag., 1925, xx, 287.) (Leningrad Acad. Sci. Bull., 19.)(vii.) Madagascar.62. Betafite, a complex titano-columbo-tantalate, of uranium, thorium, and rare earth metals, is the chief radio-active mineral found in the island. Euxenite, autunite and pitchblende (rare) also occur. It is estimated that the whole output of uranium minerals may have contained 7-5 grammes of recoverable radium.(E. Lacroix: Les Industries Min^ralea Non-metalliferes a Madagascar. Bull. Econ. de Madagascar, 1920, xvii; 48.)(Turner, H. W. : Review of the Radio-active Minerals of Madagascar. Econ. geol.. 1928, xxiii, 62, 84.)
VII. TBE COST OF RADIUM.(a.) Cost of Production.63. Very complex problems are involved in estimating the cost of the production of radium. It must be borne in mind that in most cases radium has only been detected after a period of prospecting more prolonged and expensive than is usually necessary in other forms of mining. Similarly, in the case of radium the difficulties in estimating the available tonnage in any given mine are exceptionally great. Such estimates are necessarily highly speculative. On their accuracy, however, depends the estimated value of the mine. A radium producing company which has sunk capital on the development of its property is thus faced with great difficulty in estimating the value of its constantly wasting assets. The price charged for a commodity produced in such, circumstances must therefore contain a large element of guess-work. Such companies no doubt endeavour to secure a price for their product sufficient to enable them ultimately to recover the capital that they have invested and in addition to give them a profit commensurate with the risks which they have taken in entering so uncertain an industry. Until, however, the mine is actually worked out, it is not possible to determine whether any real profit has been made as the result of their investment. Cases may well arise in which a mining company is able to sell its product at a price which is sufficient to give a high apparent profit on the cost of working but which ultimately proves to have been only sufficient to give a small real profit or in some cases may have been insufficient even to avoid a net loss.64. The case of radium is further complicated by the fact that it is only produced as a by-product of companies engaged in some other form of mining. Even in the case of the Katanga mines in the Belgian Congo, the richest radium deposits at present known, the aggregate selling value of the radium produced annually represents less than 5 per cent, of that of the copper produced annually by the company. In such a case the problem of determining the amount of profit which is theoretically attributable to each of the several articles produced is very complex.65. radium also differs from almost every other material in that its use involves such slight loss that for most practical purposes it may be regarded as not needing replacement. Every year&apos;s output is thus a net addition to the world&apos;s stock of radium. This factor enters into the price charged for radium, in so far as the value of unmined supplies of radium are discounted.66. The cost of extracting radium is relatively high in relation to the cost of the ore delivered at the works owing to the complicated character of the processes involved and the exceptional safeguards that have to be adopted for the protection of the labour engaged. Further, owing to uncertainties of demand, and more recently, to uncertainties about the delivery of the ore, it has not been found possible to keep the works in constant operation. The resulting increase of.overhead charges naturally involves a further increase in the price charged for the radium produced.67. Another element which enters into the retail price of radium is the cost of the containers, which are frequently of platinum, in which it has to be made up for use for medical purposes. Moreover, the constantly developing technique in radium-therapy involves frequent modifications of the form in which radium is required to be made up by the manufacturers.68. For the foregoing reasons we feel very diffident in offering any opinion on either the average cost of ore delivered at the works or the cost of extraction. From an interesting account of the cost of extracting radium from Carnotite ore published in ]916 by the United States Bureau of Mines (Bulletin
No. 104, pp, 116-117, 1916) it appears that the cost of providing, 1 gramme of radium from the low-grade ore containing about 3 per cent, uranium oxide in August 1915 was as follows : Cost of ore.........   $16,889   =    3,482Cost of extraction ...   $20,710   =    4,270$37,599   =    7,75269. The bulk of the expenditure on which this American calculation is based was incurred before the war and all of it before the war had been in progress for a year. In these circumstances it may reasonably be assumed that, conditions being equal, the cost of a gramme of radium so produced would be materially higher to-day.(b.) The Price of Radium.70. From our survey of the sources of radium production (Section VI) it will be seen that at the present time practically the whole of the world&apos;s annual production of radium comes from the Katanga mines in the Belgian Congo. radium has been, and is being, worked in this and other countries, but at the present time such production as still continues is very small and cannot be regarded as affording a possible source for the supply of radium in any considerable quantities. Again, indications of radium have been detected in different parts of the Empire (e.g., in Australia), and in some cases the existence of promising deposits is claimed. It may be that further prospecting may ultimately show that in some cases these claims are well founded and that it will prove possible to produce radium from such fields in commercial quantities at an economic price. From the evidence before us we are, however, satisfied that sufficient data are not at present available to enable any definite prediction to be made on this point. In any case, a considerable time must elapse before radium could be produced from any of these potential sources of supply.71. The position is, therefore, that if it were decided to make forthwith any considerable addition to the stock of radium available for medical purposes in this country, the only means of doing so would be by purchase from the Belgian producers. If arrangements could be made on the lines which we suggest (para. 82 below) for such purchases to be made through a single agency, we have no doubt that it would be possible to buy at a substantially lower figure than the present retail price of  12 a milligramme. Under such an arrangement substantial contracts could be placed for the delivery of radium over fixed periods which would enable the producing company to make arrangements by which it would be able to reduce its manufacturing costs and consequently the price charged for the radium produced.VIII.-RECOMMENDATIONS.(a.) Proposed Organisation for the Distribution of a Central Stock of Radium for Medical Purposes.72. At the present time there exists no common policy among the Hospitals for the acquisition or use of radium. Institutions acquire as much or as little as the resources at their disposal or local munificence render possible. The natural result of this absence of any co-ordinated effort is that radium is acquired for particular localities without reference to the needs of the country as a whole. This fortuitous geographical distribution of radium inevitably leads to waste of effort and loss of efficiency, the available radium which, as we have indicated, is far less than the nation&apos;s need, not being used continuously or to the best advantage.-73. Another result of the present absence of system is that the various Hospitals, by competing with one another in the radium market, may help to maintain the present high price of Radium if
not actually to raise it against themselves. Finally, it should be observed that, in a new and constantly developing technique such as that required for the successful treatment of cancer with Eadium, the number of institutions equipped with the necessary specialist personnel and other requirements must necessarily be small. Eadium used in Institutions not so equipped cannot be employed to the best advantage. Its use in such circumstances must at the best be less efficacious. At the worst it may be nugatory or even harmful.74. The importance of organising the radiological treatment of cancer in large centres will be apparent from a consideration of the requirements of any Institution that desires to undertake this branch of medical treatment efficiently. For many years to come research and treatment must continue to be intimately associated. For any such centre the following facilities are essential: (a.) An adequate stock of radium for local application.(b.) Up-to-date X-Ray Installations.-It is not enough to provide radium only. Certain cancer sites and states are better treated by X-rays for which a special type of plant is necessary; others again are better treated by X-rays in combination with radium.(c.) Facilities for First-Class Surgery. For in-patients who are in the operable stage at the time of treatment but who show themselves within a few weeks to be refractory to radiological methods, surgery should be available.(d.) Experienced and Fully-Trained Personnel. The staff should be constantly engaged in this type of work, but seldom if ever will any one member of the staff be qualified to treat all sites of cancer. Whoever specialises in one or more sites should be in a position to treat and follow up as many cases as possible in order by the experience so gained to push on the existing boundaries of knowledge. A complete registry of cases is essential.(e.) A Fully Equipped Pathological Laboratory. Not only should the nature of the growth be controlled inicro-seopically, but there should be facilities for reports on the patienfs blood conditions during the progress of the treatment, and for examination of any dejecta, &amp;c, &amp;c, which may be necessary.(f.) A Physics Department is needed, not only to undertake&apos; independent research, but to work out plans for the dosage, &amp;c, of special cases and to assist the medical staff in other problems arising in the course of the work. Moreover, every Institution using radium should have at its disposal expert advice on (i) the safe custody of radium; (ii) the protection of personnel; and (iii) the tracing and recovery of radium fractions inadvertently lost or burnt.(g.) Library.-Such an Institution must possess an absolutely up-to-date and efficient library. Such a library should contain as complete as possible a collection of the literature on all branches of the subject published in any part of the world.75. We fully realise that in some of the Institutions possessing their own stocks of Radium or receiving loans of Government radium from the Medical Research Council the foregoing conditions are amply fulfilled. Indeed, nothing but the highest praise is due to the best radium practice in this country. That this is so does not, however, alter the fact that the public advantage is not served by the irregular and unco-ordinated distribution of Radium as between one area and another.76. We do not, however, suggest that it would be desirable for all the supplies of radium in the country to be placed under the control of a single body, even for the purpose of securing co-ordination of effort.77.   As we have shown the large hospitals and other institu-tions where radium is in continuous use have their own supplier [18895] D
which are already being used to the best advantage. Such Insti-tutions would no doubt seek from time to time to obtain further supplies of their own even if a central organisation were set up. Radium^ however, is used very largely by institutions and persons, without a supply or an adequate supply of their own, whose demand for its use is irregular. In these cases, the supply of radium being small and the price high, the only way of assuring that all who need it shall be able to obtain it for use as they require it, is to organise some systematic method of distribution. Moreover, even the larger institutions with their own supply would, we think, benefit by the better organisation of the distribution of a central stock, because in times of pressure they could supplement their own supplies from that stock. In addition they would benefit in that they could buy their supplies in the future more cheaply through a single agency. In time, perhaps, a further advantage could be secured, by arranging in exceptional cases for the use elsewhere, through the agency of the proposed distributing centre, of such- fractions of radium possessed by the larger institutions as did not happen to be in immediate use. What we propose, therefore, is not complete centralisation, but a modest form of organisation which attempts to combine the good points both of a centralised and of a decentralised system, the two principles being so adjusted within the organisation as to give the best results in the national interest in the various and varying circumstances which will have to be met.78. In the foregoing paragraphs we have expressed the view that it is desirable that an organisation, should be established forthwith by the Government for the better distribution of Radium in this country. To this organisation should be entrusted the 20 grammes of Radium which we suggest the Government should aim at acquiring by the end of 1930.79. We have carefully considered the most appropriate form of organisation to be adopted. In dealing with this aspect of the problem we have endeavoured to frame a scheme which, while administratively satisfactory from the point of view of the Govern-ment will also commend itself to the institutions and hospitals with which the proposed organisation will require to work in close and harmonious relations, and will at the same time command the confidence of the medical profession in general and of the public.80. There are broadly speaking two alternatives, either of which might be adopted, viz. : (a.) The Government might acquire the necessary amount of radium, which, when bought, could be formally vested either in the Medical Research Council or in the Govern-ment Chemist or jointly in the English and Scottish Health Departments or otherwise. In such a case the actual distribution would presumably be entrusted to a Government. Committee appointed by the appropriate Minister or Ministers. The personnel of this Committee would no doubt be chosen with great care and might reasonably be expected to be chosen on the same lines as that of the existing Radiology Committee of the Medical Research Council.(?).) The Government might decide to constitute Trustees in whom the radium bought with the moneys provided by Parliament or otherwise should he vested. In this case the Trustees so constituted would, we conceive, appoint an expert body to whom they would delegate the duty of distributing the radium which they hold.81. Of these alternatives we definitely prefer the second. The appointment of such Trustees would give the Government an opportunity of securing the co-operation of the leading learned Colleges and Societies, the respective Presidents of which should, we contemplate, be invited to serve on the Board of Trustees. In addition, the Trustees should, in our view, comprise those Ministers of the Crown who have departmental responsibilities in connection with the distribution and use of radium.
IS)82. Our proposal is, therefore, that the Government should constitute a:body of Trustees to be entitled the &quot; National Eadium Trustees,&quot; whose duty it should be to hold the funds provided by Parliament or otherwise, and to purchase therewith and hold radium for the use of an expert body, which would perform functions in relation to the future supply of radium,&apos; which we are considering, analogous to those which the Radiology Committee of the Medical Research Council have hitherto performed in relation to the radium now held by the Council for medical research purposes. In addition, provision should be made enabling the Trustees, when so requested, to act as buying agents for hospitals and other institutions in this country, or for Dominion or Colonial Governments. We think that this provision would be of great value as we have little doubt that it would be the means of securing radium required by institutions in this country or Dominion and Colonial Govern-ments at a lower price than it would be possible for them other-wise to obtain it.83. We recommend that the Trustees should consist of the following persons : The Lord President of the Council (who would naturally be the Chairman), the Minister of Health, the Secretary of State for Scotland (as the Head of the Department of Health for Scotland), the President of the Royal Society, the President - of the Royal College of Physicians of London, the President of the Royal College of Surgeons of England, the Chairman of the Central Liaison Committee, of Voluntary Hospitals in Scotland, the President of the Royal Society of Medicine, and the President of the British Medical Association. In addition, we suggest that provision should be made to enable the Trustees, when constituted, should they so desire, to co-opt not more than two additional Trustees. We venture to think that a body of Trustees so constituted would command the confidence alike of Parliament, the medical profession and of the public.84. Under our proposals, the first duty of the National Radium Trustees would be to appoint a body who we suggest should be called the &quot;Radium Commission,&quot; with the following powers and duties : Generally to deal with the custody, distribution and use of all radium held by the Trustees, having regard to the advancement of knowledge, the treatment of the sick, and economy of use; and, in particular, to consider and approve plans submitted to them for the use of radium for the purposes of medical treatment and research, and to make the necessary arrangements for the supply of radium for such uses.85. We are convinced that the success or failure of this scheme, if adopted, will turn largely on the personnel selected to form the Radium Commission. This body should, in our view, be composed of the best available experts in the several sciences underlying radium therapy. On no account should particular institutions or particular interests be given representation as such on the Radium Commission. On the other hand, we are conscious that the personnel of the Radium Commission must be such as will enable it to work in harmonious relations both with the medical profession and with the Government Departments concerned.86. We accordingly recommend that the Radium Commission shall consist of eight persons in addition to the Chairman, who should be a distinguished public man not necessarily a member of the medical profession and who should be nominated by the National Radium Trustees. Of the eight members, four should be nominated by the National Radium Trustees, and one each respectively by the Minister of Health, the Secretary of State for Scotland, the. Medical Research Council, and the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research. Members of the Radium Commission should be appointed in the first instance for a period of four years and should be eligible for reappointment after an interval of one year. The Chairman should be eligible for immediate reappointment.    The nomination of a member of the Radium[18895] r 2
Commission by the: Department of Scientific and Industrial Research would in our view constitute a valuable initial link between the Commission and the National Physical Laboratory, the administra-tive responsibility for which rests with that Department. We consider this of importance as the National Physical Laboratory offers exceptional facilities for the safe custody and appropriate preparation of radium. For this reason we suggest that at an early stage arrangements should be made by the Radium Commission with the National Physical Laboratory, for (a.) the custody of the radium put at the disposal of the Commission by the National Radium Trustees when such radium is not actually in use for medical purposes, (b) its preparation in form for use, and (c) its recovery from such preparation on return from loan.87. We do not contemplate that the annual expenditure on the preparation and recovery of radium or the administrative expenses of the Radium Commission will amount to a substantial sum in relation to the initial cost of purchasing the proposed quantity of radium. Arrangements might not unreasonably be made to secure a set-off to the cost of these services, to be defrayed by a small charge made for the loan of radium by the Commission to institutions.88. There can be no doubt moreover that progress throughout the country will be greatly promoted by the free communication of information as between all the working centres, and that one of the most important functions of the Radium Commission may prove to be the collection and publication of methods and results of radium-therapy for the country as a whole.(b.) The Provision of the Funds Required.89. There remains the question of the provision of the funds required for the purchase of the 20 grammes of radium which, we are convinced, is urgently required. There are three possible courses which might be adopted: (a.) The Government might provide the funds required for the purchase of the whole amount.(b.) The money might be furnished in part by the Govern-ment and in part by the public. If this course were adopted, the best plan would probably be a public appeal, in which the Government would undertake to contribute pound for pound up to some maximum sum to be determined.(c.) An appeal might be made to the public for the whole of the sum necessary.90. We do not recommend the first course, as it would, in our view, be unreasonable to ask the Government to find the whole of the money for a service which, so far as its hospital use is concerned, has been provided hitherto by private benefactions. Moreover, future needs and the means of meeting them must be borne in mind. In the not distant future the supply of radium in the&apos;country will have to be still further increased. If, in the present instance, the Government shouldered the whole burden, gifts would probably not be forthcoming in the future for this purpose, at any rate on the same scale as in the past, as the impression would undoubtedly be created that the Government had definitely assumed responsibility for this particular service. It is, in our view, highly desirable that the provision of radium for medical and scientific work should continue to be regarded as a suitable object for private munificence. If unfortunately this ceased to be the case, there would, we are confident, be a resultant check in the progress of radium-therapy in this country. In cases such as this where the boundaries of knowledge are being constantly extended, it is an essential condition that the scientific workers engaged on the problem should have at their disposal adequate supplies of the substance on which they are carrying put research and should not be hampered in their work by con-siderations of the immediate medical needs of the Institutions in which thev are vwkinv;.
91. We have no doubt that if the second course indicated above were adopted by the Government, immediate success would be assured, and that the  200,000 which is needed at once would be raised without difficulty.92.. If, however, in present circumstances, the Government should find itself unable to adopt this course, or if it appeared that a decision on this matter could not be reached until after consider-able delay, the third alternative might be adopted and the public invited to provide the whole of the money, the Government only providing the proposed organisation and the facilities available at the National Physical Laboratory. As we have pointed out, the need is urgent, and adequate steps of some kind should be taken immediately to meet it. If the Government were to announce that they proposed to arrange the organisation, and an appeal were made to the public for the  200,000 to buy the 20 grammes of additional radium now required, it is not unlikely that the money would be forthcoming. If it were not, it would still be possible for the Government, at a later stage, to furnish some subsidy to stimulate contributions from the public.93. For the reasons explained in paragraph 90 it would be important that, in making any appeal, the Government should make it clear that they did not suggest that all gifts for the purchase of radium should henceforth be placed at the disposal of the National Eadium Trustees. The need on the part of the larger institutions to have their own supplies would still continue, and some donors will naturally prefer to equip in this respect particular institutions. There can be no doubt, however, that the most urgent need at the moment is the creation of a distributing organisation, and the placing at its disposal of an adequate supply of Eadium for loan or hire to institutions and research workers as and when they require it.IX.-SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS.94. For the convenience of the Committee of Civil Research we summarise our conclusions as follows : (i.) Knowledge of the biological and curative properties of radium for the treatment of cancer and of the technique of its application has advanced very rapidly in recent years and has greatly increased, and is likely still further to increase, the amount of radium required for medical purposes in Great Britain (para. 9) ; (ii.) The amount of radium belonging to the Government which is available for medical purposes in England, Scotland and Wales is 2-2 grammes, and the estimated amount believed to be the property of Hospitals and private medical practitioners, or likely so to be in (say) three months&apos; time, is approximately 22-7 grammes, making a total of 24-9 (or say 25) grammes (paras. 12-23); (iii.) The amount required to meet existing needs in Great Britain is probably approximately 49 or 50 grammes, i.e., an immediate addition of about 24 grammes to the existing national stock is required (para. 33); (iv.) Owing to the lack of trained personnel and to the inadequacy of the available hospital accommodation it is probable that not more than 20 additional grammes of radium could be effectively absorbed for medical purposes by the end of 1930 (para. 34) ;(v.) Full advantage can be obtained from a given quantity of radium only when it is constantly in application, i.e., when it can be transferred from one patient to another with a minimum of delay. Such conditions are only to be found in centres possessing the necessary specialist personnel, technical equipment, and available beds (paras. 24-26 and 73-74);
(vi.) There is at present no common policy between the Hospitals in acquiring radium, hospitals buying such quantities as the resources at their disposal, or local munificence render possible, with the result that existing private stocks of radium have been acquired for particular localities without reference to the needs of the country as a whole (para. 72);(vii.) There exists a pressing need for the establishment of a central stock of radium and the organisation of some systematic method for its distribution (para. 77); (viii.) Until sources of supply at present unproved or unknown are discovered in the Empire or elsewhere, the only source from which additional supplies of radium for medical purposes is obtainable in any quantity is the Belgian Congo (para. 70);(ix.) If an organisation such as that referred to in (vii) above was established, it should be possible for it to obtain radium for substantially less than the existing market price as it would be in a position to arrange large purchases spread over a considerable period (para. 71) ; (x.) Such an organisation should also be given powers not only to purchase radium for its own pur-poses, but also to act, when so requested, as a buying agent for hospitals and other institutions in this country or for Dominion or Colonial Governments (para. 82);(xi.) The amount of radium required by the Government for the Fighting Services and for use in physical research is relatively so small that it would be a mistake to require that additional radium needed for these purposes should be bought through the agency of any organisation that may be established for medical purposes (paras. 36 and 38).95. In the light of the foregoing conclusions, we submit the following recommendations in regard to the medical use of radium for-the consideration of the Committee of Civil Research : (i.) Steps should be taken at once to ensure the acquisition by instalments of 20 additional grammes of radium element for medical purposes (para. 78);(ii.) A body of Trustrees should be appointed entitled the National Radium Trustees, whose duty it should be to hold the funds provided by Parliament or otherwise, and to purchase therewith and hold radium for use by the Radium Commission referred to in (iv) below (para. 82);(iii.) The National Radium Trustees should consist of the following persons: -The Lord President of the Council, The Minister of Health, The Secretary of State for Scotland, The President of the Royal Society, The President of the Royal College of Physicians; of London,The President of the Royal College of Surgeons of England, -The Chairman of the Central Liaison Committee of voluntary Hospitals in Scotland, The President of the Royal Society of Medicine, The President of the British Medical Association, Two members to be co-opted, if subsequently so desired,   by   the   National   Radium   Trustees (para. 83) ;(iv.) The National Radium Trustees should appoint a body to be called &quot;The Radium Commission&quot; who should have the following powers and duties: Generally to deal with the custody, distribution and use of all radium held by the Trustees, having regard to the advancement of knowledge, the treatment of the sick, and economy of use;   and, in particular, to
consider and approve plans submitted to them for the use of radium for the purposes of medical treatment and research, and to make the necessary arrangements for the supply of radium for such uses (para. 84);(v.) The Radium Commission should consist of the following nine persons :-(a.) A Chairman who should be a distinguished public man, not necessarily a member of the medical profession, nominated by the National Radium Trustees;(b.) Four persons nominated by the National Radium Trustees;(c.) Four representatives nominated one each by the Minister of Health, the Secretary of State for Scotland, the Medical Research Council, and the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (para. 86);(vi.) Members of the Radium Commission should be appointed for a period not exceeding four years, and should be eligible for reappointment after an interval of one year, the Chairman being eligible for immediate reappointment (para. 86);(vii.) The Radium Commission should make arrangements with the National Physical Laboratory for: (a.) The custody of the radium put at the disposal of the Commission by the National Radium Trustees when such radium is not actually in use for medical purposes;(b.) Its preparation in form for use;(c.) Its recovery from such preparation on return from loan (para. 86).(Signed)RAYLEIGH (Chairman). S. J. CHAPMAN.II. L. F. ERASER.WALTER M. FLETCHER,W. GILLMAN.J. FREDk. N. GREEN.MICHAEL HESELTINE.T. H.
