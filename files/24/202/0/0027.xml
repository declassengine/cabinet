This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government). E 0 R E T --- 0 A B I H E T o77(29)WORKMEB&apos;S 0OMP EH SATIOH.Memorandum by the Home Secretary,I desire to draw the attention of my colleagues to a flaw which has recently assumed serious proportions - in the present arrangements under the Workmen&apos;-&apos;s Compensation Act in regard to the payment of compensation in oases of the employer&apos;s insolvency, The matter is dealt with in Section 7 of the consolidating Act of 1925 which seeks to safeguard the rights of the injured workman in the event of his employer becoming insolvent by giving him the benefit of any policy of insurance which the employer may have effected against his liabilities,  and, where the employer is not insured,  by allowing the capital value of the weekly  compensation to rank as a preferential debt in the distribution of the estate.In most industries the general practice of employers is to insure comprehensively against their liabilities under the Act and where this is done the injured workman is not prejudiced by the employer&apos;s insolvency as he is then entitled to claim his com-pensation direct from the insurersc    In the Coal Mining Industry, however,  it is quite usual for the employer either not to insure at all or to avail himself only of such insurance as can be obtained from ore of the Coalowners Mutual Indemnity Associations which is often of a very partial character0    For example, many owners in the South Wales Coalfield are insured only with the South Wales and Monmouthshire coalowners Mutual Indemnity Association which limits its insurance to &quot;catastrophe&quot; risks, that is to say,  accidents where more than three persons are killed or injured-    In such cases the workman may suffer hardship either by losing altogether the whole or part of his compensation or, where the assets may ultimately be sufficient to pay the preferential debts in full but the funds immediately available are insufficient, by being kept out of   his compensation a longer time pending the final settlement,.
The inquiries I have made show that many injured miners have recently suffered hardship in this way as a result of the numerous Colliery liquidations which have taken place during the last two or three years *    In only a few oases,  I am glad to  say, has there been any permanent loss of compensation (4 oases have been traced involving a total loss of  ,7000 odd and affecting 24 workmen)  but in a large number of cases the workmen have been temporarily kept out of their compensation for prolonged periodsj  and have been forced to have recourse to the Poor Lav/.    For example,  it appears from figures supplied by the Pontypridd Guardians that in the period 1st May to 11th December last, relief amounting to well over  9,000 was granted to 255 workmen, whose weekly payments had been interrupted by the liquidations of the oollieries at which they were employed.I have been strongly and repeatedly pressed both by the Miners&apos;  Representatives and by Boards of Guardians to take immediate steps to amend the law,  and I feel that the injured workman has a very  strong claim to some ampler measure of pro-teotion in this matter.    How such protection should be afforded is a question which calls for most careful examination and on which I have no definite view to put forward at present.    It will be remembered that the latest Home Office Oommittee on Workmen5s Compensation of which Mr. Kolman Gregory was Chairman and which reported in 1920 recommended the adoption of a system of compulsory insurance  (subject to certain exceptions)  and I am inclined to think that some system of compulsory insurance - if found on enquiry to be practicable - would be the proper remedy but this of course is a gigantic question and is clearly one for the Cabinet and not for a department.    As I have already indicated in replies to Questions in the House of Commons,  I am having the whole question explored Departmentalism  and I will acquaint my colleagues with the results in due course.W.J .H.18th March,  1929;
