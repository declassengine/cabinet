Stanley Baldwin, MaP*,Prime Minister, London,   W*C.l10, Downing Street, S0W01.lear Sir,The Executive Council of this Confederatloh, at their meeting held to-day, gave due consideration to your favour of the 8th inst.I am instructed on their behalf to state that while the Council are gratified by your intimation of full sympathy with nan of the opinions they have advanced, they cannot but express dis-appointment that you have not seen fit to adopt their carefully considered proposal for a full and impartial inquiry into the iron and steel industry on the lines submitted and for the reasons stat in my communication of December 31st last.The Gonfederation Executive Council, having previously ascertained that no serious opposition was likely to arise in Parliament tc the adoption of their proposal, had hoped you would have seen your way to take that course at an early date.The Council instruct me to state that in venturing to comment - as they feel it necessary to do - upon the reasons given in your letter for the conclusion arrived at, they do so in no snirit of controversy but because of the serious importance they attach to the matter.In proposing a Royal Commission or other competent Committee the Confederation Executive Council lid not contemplate any long drawn Gut or roving Inquiry such as your letter suggests, nor, having regard to the facts already ascertained by the Balfour Committee and through other authoritative sources7 do they oonsido that would be necessary.    On that aspect of the matter I am to remind you that the Samuel Commission produced an exhaustive Rcpor and well-considered conclusions on the coal industry in the space of a f ew months * X.
On the other hand., they feel that the form of inquiry contemplated, as a part of -the policy of the present Government not only involves unnecessary delay, but by being dependent upon the circumstances attending a Parliamentary Election cannot fail to introduce that element of political controversy which our proposal seeks to avoid and which, as indicated in my previous communication, has, in the view of my Council, been an unfortunate - because detrimental - feature of the consideration given to the industry up to the present.So far as the inquiry of the Balfour Committee is con-cerned, it is true that in its general industrial survey its report makes a useful contribution to the information required, but presumably as your letter contemplates a later inquiry, you do not regard the Balfour report as likely to be sufficiently complete or its findings sufficiently conclusive t^ ejae/blo- you t* deal specifically with the ircn and steel industry.The Confederation Executive Council venture to suggest that the Balfour Report would be as readily available for the information cf a Committee set up forthwith as for one appointed at a later date, but with, the added advantage that several months1 work of the body now appointed, would have been carried out, and, subject to appropriate terms of reference, another Committee would be unnecessary.The Confederation Executive Council welcome any benefits which may be found to have been conferred upon the industry and the workpeople employed therein by the measures referred to in your letter, but they feel that the terms of your communication do not disclose a policy and procedure in relation to this great basic industry which will enable its conditions to be treated on the basis of its importance in the economic life .of the country, with that necessary freedom from political prejudices v/hich the Council are anxious to secure and with due regard to all the interests involved,The Confederation Executive Gouncil, therefore, venture to hope that on re-consideration you may yet find it possible to set up a Committee on the lines they have proposed.Yours faithfully,For the Iron and Steel Trades Confederation(&quot;Sgd, ) Ao PUGHGeneral Secretary.
