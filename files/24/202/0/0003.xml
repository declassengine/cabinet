[&quot;This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.&quot;]SECRET. Copy No,   21CP. 53 (29).UNEMPLOYMENT.Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer covering Treasury Memorandum.I CIRCULATE a note prepared in the Treasury on the memoranda of the Home Secretary and the Minister of Labour.I do not advise my colleagues in the closing months of a Parliament, and possibly of an Administration, to challenge the basic arguments upon which our monetary policy stands. That policy has been pursued by all British Governments; and it seems to me very unlikely that a Conservative Government would be well advised in abandoning it or throwing doubts upon it. France and German)&apos; have gone through the Bankruptcy Court, and have started business anew with vigour and success. Our position is radically different from that either of France or of Germany. France is practically self-supporting economically, while we are dependent for a substantial portion of our daily bread upon a world-wide clientele. Germany, the universal debtor, had everything to gain by writing off her mark indebtedness. We are still the greatest of creditor nations; and even in the period since the War we have increased our long-term investments oversea by a larger amount than the United States. The London Bill, as the Treasury point out, has again become the primary instrument of credit throughout the world. The fall in the cost of living, although depressing to trade and agriculture, has given us a more contented people and a better standard of living for the wage-earners than at any other time in our own history or in any other country in Europe. During the present Administration in spite of the great strike period exports have increased, savings have increased, and the balance of trade has improved.We allow ourselves to be disparaged abroad and demoralised at home by the weekly figures of Unemployment. These figures are no true index of national conditions. They are a special culture developed by post-war extensions of the original Unemployment Insurance Act. In my opinion the Unemployment position should be the subject, not of weekly, but of quarterly, reviews, in which Employment figures should play an equal part with those of Unemployment, and the relation of both to the Poor Law population and cost of living should from time to time also be shown.[18892a]
Even on the defective and misleading barometer of weekly Unemployment returns there will probably be, out of a larger population, fewer unemployed in June than there were when we took office. Over 200,000 of these are so-called miners mostly surface and auxiliary labourers who have been wisely shed from the purged and partially reconditioned coal industry. But for this melancholy accession to the Unemployment registers-in itself due to a healthy process the comparison with 1924 would be much more favourable. It is to be hoped that we shall not let ourselves be drawn by panic or electioneering into unsound schemes to cure unemployment, and divert national credit and savings from the fertile channels of private enterprise to State undertakings fomented mainly for political purposes. The devastating nature of the criticism which could be applied to a policy of curing unemployment by large loan expenditure of an unprofitable character, whether on the roads or elsewhere, would only become apparent after a Government was committed to that policy and to the promises based upon it.Nothing would be more unsuitable than for the Conservative Party to launch at the eleventh hour an ill-thought-out policy of this kind, avowedly for electioneering purposes.w. s. c.Treasury Chambers, S.W., February 25, 1929.
I This Docarnent in the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;a Government.]SECRET.UNEMPLOYMENT.Note prepared in the Treasury on the Memoranda circulated by the Home Secretary and the Minister of Labour: CP. 27 (29) and 37 (29).I. DEVELOPMENT LOANS.1. THE Home Secretary cannot disguise from himself the fact that an attack on the Governments unemployment policy is inevitable, and he reaches the conclusion that it is necessary to find a new comprehensive policy with the object of stimulating production in the depressed industries so as to secure work at their trades for as many of the unemployed as possible, and of quickening migration overseas so as to absorb the remainder of the permanent surplus. Eor these purposes he suggests that in order to open up vast areas of undeveloped country in the Dominions and Crown Colonies and to secure the above-mentioned objects, a publicly subscribed loan guaranteed by the Government should be raised for development works in those areas, to be constructed so far as practicable of British materials. This plan would be supplemented by provision from the British Exchequer for payment of part of the service of any such loan for a lengthy period, and for the maintenance of the various undertakings involved until such time, possibly twenty or thirty years ahead, as they succeed in paying their way. Realising that some considerable time must elapse before the raising of Dominion and Colonial development loans can react on the labour market here, he proposes that, in order to bridge the interval and to anticipate proposals which are being mooted by the Opposition parties, the Government should create at once employment for as many of the unemployed as possible by means of a large road construction scheme, presumably to be financed out of loan. The Minister of Labour, while thinking the Home Secretary&apos;s apprehensions exaggerated, is of opinion that it is desirable to inquire whether any measures can be proposed which can both fulfil the conditions of the Home Secretary&apos;s policj^ and also deserve serious consideration a.s passing the test of being businesslike, and he puts forward certain concrete proposals as being worthy of examination.2. The existing policy of the Government was succinctly stated by the Prime Minister in reply to a question by Mr. Lawson in the House of Commons on the 7th instant (&quot;Debates,&quot; column 1932), when he said that, in the opinion of LTis Majesty&apos;s Government, the great State borrowings which would be involved by the schemes of national work advocated by the Opposition would in the end do much more harm than good. The Prime Minister added that, &quot; in our view the objects which we all desire can best be attained by perseverance in. our policy, which aims, by relief of trade &quot;from the burden of rates and in other ways, at the absorption of the unemployed into productive industry and their transference from areas of distress.&quot;3. The purpose of this note is to suggest that the alternative proposals now advocated by the Home Secretary and the schemes mentioned by the Minister of Labour would be likely to be ineffective for the objects in view, and that even their superficial results would be so inconsiderable that they could not plausibly be represented as making any appreciable contribution towards relieving the existing volume of unemployment.4. Before the Government can give increased employment by these or any other plans, it must obtain resources to defray the expenditure.5. Unless the Government are prepared to take steps to bring about an inflation of banking credits, they cannot themselves create resources. They must obtain them by taxation or borrowing. Even where there are funds already accumulating, e.g., the Road Eund, the same thing applies. A balance on the Road Eund may simplify the Budget problem, but the balance is, in fact, held in the[1889.2] B
form of Treasury Bills, and Treasury Bills held by the Hoad Fund cannot he converted into&apos; men at work until!.they have been sold, until we ;have borrowed from banks or private persons that amount more than we areborrovviriglrom them at present. How&apos;the accumulating resources of the Road Fund can best be utilised raises, of course, other considerations of policy, but it is unnecessary to pursue these considerations further for the purposes of the present argument. Thus, in all cases the question is whether  1,000 spent by the Government will give more employment than if the  1,000 had been left to the public to spend. This will be so only if the Government is skilful enough to find ways of spending  1,000 which give more employment than the spending of  1,000 by the public would do. This is a very difficult problem, and against any success achieved must be set the waste anil inefficiency which accompany all hasty Government expenditure.6. The resources on which industry relies for working capital and new developments consist in bank advances, new capital issues and the accumulating reserves of business itself. So far from being abnormally low at the present time, these all stand high. This fact suggests clearly that it is not lack of banking-facilities that is hampering trade, and that the cause must rather be sought in high cost of production (due partly to defective organisation), lack of demand on the part of our foreign customers, and intensified competition on the part of our foreign rivals. If we look, for example, at a typical bank the Midland the advances stand about as high as they ever have been,  214 millions, and of this great sum nine-tenths at least represents loans to equip production and trade. In the last five years the Banks have increased their advances from  744 millions to  971 millions, or by  227 millions. They have reduced their investments (largely Government stocks) by  222 millions. It is difficult to see how industry would be benefited if the Banks were driven to substitute for a proportion of their advances the scrip of Government loans to be spent in the Dominions and Colonies or on road construction, or if subscribers to new capital issues were induced to divert their subscriptions to new Government-sponsored loans, or if business concerns devoted to this object the reserves originally intended for their own development.7. If there were no artificial inflation of credit (which, in present circum-stances, would inevitably produce depreciated exchanges and carry its own revenge), a policy of large loans for development would probably be quite nugatory as regards the general employment position, the resources directed by the Government to the employment of extra labour being taken away from the resources of private persons, the investment of which would have led to the employment of labour at other points.* Moreover, there can be little doubt that extensive Government borrowings would tend to increase the costs of production, and thus further to aggravate the real evil from which we are now suffering.8. Turning now to consider the more immediate effect of the proposals advocated by the Home Secretary and the Minister of Labour, it is apparent that at the present moment Australia and New Zealand are not prepared to absorb any considerable number of migrants.* It may be observed that an article at p. 710 of the current &quot; Nation&quot; disputes the line of reasoning that is embodied in paragraphs 6 and 7 of this Memorandum on three grounds : 1. The &quot; Nation&quot; contends that the argument that any money raised by the State for liuancing productive schemes must diminish pro tanto the supply of capital available for ordinary industry would apply equally to any new business enterprise entailiug capital expenditure. But the case urged by the Treasury against Government Development boans is precisely that such capital as is available for investment can and will besl.be utilised by private enterprise. If the capitalist system is sound, private enterprise is more likely than the Government to direct investment to purposes which are economically justified and will tend to increase the wealth of the community.2. The second argument advanced by the &quot; Nation &quot; is that &quot; the volume of real investment is falling short of the volume of money savings.&quot; So far as this country is concerned, the Treasury is not aware of any evidence for this statement, but there are many positive indications to the precise contrary.3. The third argument is that &quot; it is desirable to direct to home development savings which now find their way abroad.&quot; But in the first place the Government has no powers of interference with the freedom of the Money Market which would enable it to prevent large Government borrowings from trenching upon the home as well as the overseas investment of private savings. Secondly, there is the fact, to which attention is drawn in the current Economist&quot; (p. 386), that, the vast bulk of our present unemployment is concentrated in industries which are predominantly&apos; exporting industries. &quot; Their need is not capital, but markets. How would these industries and their workers be helped by a policy which curtailed our investments abroad and concen-trated capital proportionately at home ?&quot;
9. A group settlement scheme has already been carried out in Western Australia, under which ; 1,800 farms were established at a cost of approximately  3 millions. (apart from expenditure on roads and railways), the bulk of which is unlikely to be ever recovered.10. The only further scheme for settlement in that State of which the Treasury and the Overseas Settlement Department are aware is a proposal for the establish-ment of 3,500 (not 35,000) farms which is now under a preliminary survey and examination by the Commonwealth Development Commission. On present information its prospects and its probable effects on British emigration appear to be very speculative. A considered report upon it cannot be expected for some months, and it must be remembered that the recent Business Commission on Australian Development under the Chairmanship of Sir A. Duckham has recommended the restriction of further extensive development in Australia. The Canadian Government have made it clear that they do not favour any ambitious schemes of land settlement. As the cost of placing a settler on the land in the Dominions would average upwards of  1,000, the cost of dealing with any appreciable number of the unemployed by such schemes, even if they were acceptable, would be enormous, and experience shows that progress would be very slow. It is suggestedJ^hat reliance must rather be placed on the stimulus which should be given to the nat*s*ial flow of emigration to Canada by the recent reduction of the ocean passage rate. &apos;.  ;11. Money is available under the East Africa Guaranteed Loans Act for further railway development in East Africa as soon as the surveys now in progress enable practicable schemes to be put forward. Kenya borrowed  5,000,000 in 1927 for railways and other public works and  3,500,000 in 1928 without the assistance of the guarantee, and will probably spend a further  2,000,000 this year. Palestine has raised the necessary funds under the same Act for the construction of Haifa Harbour. The Zambesi Bridge scheme, which is specially mentioned by the Minister of Labour, has been under negotiation with the railway companies involved, and will be ready as soon as the borings for the foundations have been completed and a settle-ment has been reached of certain legal difficulties which may prove to be extremely embarrassing concerning the position vis-a-vis the Portuguese Government of the Trans-Zambesia Railway an essential link in the chain of communications of which the bridge would form part. The estimated cost of the scheme is approximately  1,100,000 for the bridge and its approaches, and  1,300,000 for extensions and improvements to the existing railways and lake services, spread over about four years.12. It should be borne in mind, however, in considering the immediate effects of development loans to the Dominions and Colonies upon employment in this country that on the average rather more than one half of the money will be spent on colonial labour, land and materials (thus further turning the exchanges against us), and it is only that portion of the money Avhich is spent on the purchase of British materials which directly helps our own industry. The effect of such expenditure in stimulating British industry, even assuming that it is not merely a diversion of resources, is less than is often supposed. It is estimated that a loan of  10 millions for overseas railway development, the expenditure of which would probably take about five years, would onlv involve an increase of about 1 per cent, in annual exports of iron andft i * &apos;&apos; -i   &apos;   &apos;steel from this country and about 3 per cent, in the exports of rolling-stock.13. From the slight response made by Empire Governments and public utility undertakings overseas to the terms offered by the Trade Facilities Act of 1924 and the slow rate at which schemes have matured under the East Africa Guaranteed Loan it is clear that  the renewed offer of further Guaranteed Loan facilities would not produce any considerable number of proposals which could be regarded as financially sound. This probability is recognised by the Home Secretary&apos;s proposal that we should saddle ourselves with payment of part of the interest charges and the maintenance costs of the various undertakings for a prolonged period. This liability would impose a serious and indefinite strain upon the resources of the British Exchequer. It is. more than doubtful whether, even in the long run, the wealth producing capacity of the British Empire Would be increased by the premature adoption of uneconomic schemes. It is certain that in the meantime the economic and financial difficulties of this country would be enhanced..14.   As regards road construction, it is true that, if properly directed and economically carried out, it does furnish the country with a real asset; but it has the [18892] b 2     .
grave defect, from the point of view under consideration, that employment is smali in comparison with the money spent (averaging about 2,000 men for a period of one year per million pounds spent), and can only be increased by adopting wasteful methods of construction The Interdepartmental Committee on Unemployment which reported to the Government in November last (CP. 325 (28)) found that the maximum dimensions of a trunk road reconstruction programme which could be launched at an early date was  8 millions spread over 3 or 4 years. This is no doubt the programme to which the Minister of Labour refers. It will be seen that it would give employment to 4,000 or 5,000 men only per annum for the period. Even if it were decided to refund the whole cost to local authorities from the Road Fund, a course which might have embarrassing consequences, a considerable period of pre-pavation would be required before the full amount of employment could be given, and it seems clear that in present circumstances no substantial employment could be given by this means before the summer. Speaking generally, the slightness of the contribution to the solution of the unemployment problem which is made by schemes for the creation of artificial employment is emphasised by the fact mentioned in paragraph 142 of the Report of the Industrial Transference Board (Command Paper 3156) that under the varied and comprehensive programmes of works of this nature, approved since the Armistice, to a total of nearly  190 millions, there have been at no one date more than 75,000 men employed on such works, and of these many for short spells only.1-5.- It is incorrect to suggest that the employment relief works authorised by the Government last autumn disregard the advice of the Industrial Transference Board. These schemes were advisedly adopted under such conditions as to be an incentive to the transference policy recommended by the Board and adopted by the Government.16. In contrast with the meagre results which alone could be claimed, even -on a superficial analysis and after a considerable lapse of time, to flow from any attempts to create artificial employment, the effect of the existing policy of the Government can surely be shown, to be incomparably more powerful. Under that policy, including the railway freight reliefs (towards the anticipation of which a sum of  1 million has been provided in the current financial year),  16 millions will be provided in 1929 and over  35 millions in 1930, mainly for the relief of industry, and especially of the depressed portion of it, from the burden of rates. These large sums will go directly to reduce the cost of production, which, as already stated, is one of the chief evils from which industry is now suffering. There are already indications that the relief now actually given and that anticipated may be beginning to bear fruit. Large Government expenditure for the purposes suggested by the Home Secretary will tend pro tanto to nullify the effect of this policy.17. The hasty adoption at this stage of the programme advocated by the Home Secretary would, it is suggested, be universally regarded as a death-bed confession of failure which is uncalled for and would be unjustified. It would not produce, between now and the summer, any appreciable results for which credit could be claimed. As a declaration of policy on the part.of the Government it is unlikely at the present juncture that it would even carry conviction.II.-.DOUBTS AND QUERIES ABOUT THE GOLD STANDARD.18. In the second part of his memorandum, the Minister of Labour raises a number of economic doubts as to the wisdom of the financial policy which the Government has followed during the past eight years: While he disclaims the inference that he is an inflationist, or that he wishes to abandon the gold standard, this part of his memorandum is, in fact, a restatement of the criticisms which have been ventilated in the. Press against the Government&apos;s policy.19. From the purely theoretical standpoint, no doubt a great deal might be said on these economic questions. But this is scarcely the time or the place to attempt a full-dress defence of the gold standard; nor would any economic expose have much effect in silencing the Government critics who are only interested in economics in so far as it supplies them with political ammunition. The present note is, therefore, merely a hasty attempt to deal with some of the more practical points referred to by the Minister of Labour.
20. One: of the questions that are asked is &quot;whether those on whose initiative this policy was commenced, foresaw the results of the rapid deflation occurring in a country in which workers had the will and the power to resist strenuously a reduction in the nominal rate of their earnings, even though the real value would remain unchanged.&quot; The reply to this is that the Committee of 1924 which was presided over, first of all, by Sir Austen Chamberlain and later by Sir John (now Lord) Bradbury, expressly pointed out that there was a discrepancy between British and American gold prices which would have to be bridged. &quot; We must still be prepared to face a fall in the final price level here of a significant, though not very large, amount, unless it should happen that a corresponding rise takes place in America.&quot; But they pointed out that, in present conditions, &quot; this argument against immediate action was not of great weight &quot; because &quot; the adjustment of price levels required to restore and maintain pre-war parity needs to be only some 1^ per cent, larger than that required to hold the exchange at its present rate.&quot; They then proceeded to point out the other considerations which really left no option to His Majesty&apos;s Government but to proceed as rapidly as possible with the accomplishment of the gold standard policy; and they advised that the &quot; assimilation of British currency to the gold currencies of the world is so necessary for the ultimate prosperity of British trade that any temporary disadvantage, if such arises from the measures necessary to maintain parity, will be many times out-weighed.&quot; &quot; Such credit restriction,&quot; they went on, &quot; as may become necessary to adjust the general level of sterling prices to a free gold market may well be less drastic than that which would be required in order to maintain a &apos; managed &apos; pound in the neighbourhood of parity.&quot;21. The Committee therefore quite correctly warned the Government that a certain adjustment would be necessary, but they pointed out that unless the Govern-ment were prepared to see sterling depreciate again from the level already reached (a step which would have been very definitely injurious to the country as a whole) this effort would have to be made in any case; and that only a small additional strain would be entailed by the restoration of gold parity, as compared with the strain required to hold sterling at its then exchange value. On this latter point the Committee probably understated the case. In reality, there was no option between either restoring the pre-war gold parity of sterling (with South Africa and Australia) or letting the British currency depreciate very substantially.22. The impression which the Committee gave of the probable extent of the adjustment of prices required may be criticised as unduly optimistic; but it should be remembered that there was at the time a comparatively small gap between the indices of wholesale prices in Great Britain and America, and that the best opinion was that, allowing for the imperfection of the indices, any variation of the purchasing power parity, if it existed at all, was very small.As events have shown, the adjustment of prices has been a longer and more difficult process than was anticipated. This was due largely to the fact that the American price level, instead of rising to meet us, fell slowly but steadily throughout 1925 and 1926, necessitating a much greater restriction of our price level than had been expected, in order to maintain parity. But it remains true that the process of adjustment did not impose an impossible strain on the national economy; and that the other factors in favour of reversion to the gold standard were so important as to outweigh the transitional difficulties.23. Further, it is a complete mistake to suppose that we should have had no unemployment if we had not gone on to the gold standard. Unemployment was practically as intense in the period before we reverted to the gold standard as it is to-day. Depreciation of the currency no doubt constituted an artificial stimulus to some British industries, as it has clone to our continental rivals, so long as it lasted; and it helped to disguise the defects of management and equipment-which are now tardily being remedied. But it must be remembered that depreciation is a. drug, addiction to which must in the end undermine the economic prosperity of any country that indulges in it. A policy of definite devalorisation of sterling (assmning that it had been practicable) might no doubt have averted some of the troubles we have had with organised labour, but it would certainly not have solved the problem of unemployment as a whole.24. The main cause of our difficulties during these past years have in fact been international and not national.   The people in these islands have to earn their
living by means of competitive industry: We - must importi the bulk jofnthe food required to sustain our population, and we can only do this (apart from our financial and trading profits) by exporting manufactured goods at&apos;prices which our customers are prepared to pay. The United States of America, which is practically a self-contained unit, may perhaps be able to sustain an equilibrium of production by reference to purely internal factors and can therefore build up its industrial structure on the basis of &quot; consumers&apos; credit&quot; (though even in the case of the United States the credit system shows, at present, considerable signs of strain). But this policy is utterly impracticable for the United Kingdom where both the level of prices and the volume of credit must be regulated with constant regard to international as well as national factors.25. Now the industries in which unemployment is peculiarly acute have all suffered, in different ways, from the over-development of similar industries throughout the world which took place during and after the war. For example, during and immediately after the war there was an acute shortage of coal and it commanded an exorbitant price. The result was that every country in Europe made desperate efforts to work any deposits they could find in their territories, while the Peace Treaty compelled Germany to expand its production to supply France and Italy. . :At the same time there had been a considerable expansion in the use of oil-fuel and.electricity in place of coal. The result was that when the French mines which had been destroyed in the war had been re-equipped and resumed production, the total output of coal was quickly found to be in excess of the world demand. Similarly, in the iron and steel trades, war requirements led to the erection of large modern plants capable of turning out quantities of steel products far in excess of the pre-war standard of production. As soon as the post-war boom broke, it was impossible to find customers capable of keeping all these plants active and those whose costs of production were too high were inevitably under employed or completely idle. Of these a goodly proportion were to be found in this country; but it should be emphasised that the high costs of production here were not solely due to the resistance of labour to the reduction of nominal wages, but were also due to defects of equipment and organisation, for wdiich the employers must be regarded as responsible. Shipbuilding and cotton were hit by rather different difficulties; but in all these industries there has been an excessive capacity of production m comparison to the world demand, tending to produce cut-throat competition which can only be obviated either by closing down the &quot;marginal&quot; producers or by international arrangements.26. On the other hand, the effect of the war was to destroy a large proportion of the then existing wealth of all the European countries involved and to reduce their capacity to purchase the goods which we used to export to them before the war. This poverty led to, and was corrected by, the depreciation of exchanges to which the curtailment of our exports is largely due. Meanwhile, our own people had grown accustomed to consuming more and saving less than before the war, so that the capital available for investment abroad was limited. It is little wonder, therefore, that our exports have not yet reached the pre-war volume (after adjustment of prices). The wonder is that they have attained so high a volume as they have a volume which already exceeds that in the years immediately before we reverted to the gold standard, when we still enjoyed the blessings of depreciation and a &quot; managed &quot; (but somewhat unstable) currency. For example, in 1928 British exports represented a value in gold nearly 5 per cent, greater than the value of our exports in 1924, despite the fact that in 1924 (owing to the occupation of the Ruhr) we exported over  72 millions&apos; worth of coal, as compared with only  39 millions&apos; worth in 1928.27. The restoration of the gold standard in this country not only benefited our industries directly, by giving them a stable basis for the purchase of their raw-materials, but indirectly assisted them by leading the way to the restoration of European currencies generally, which (as shown in the Report by Sir Henry * Strakosch to the Financial Committee of the League, published last November) has had a very remarkable effect in encouraging the volume of trade generally. The figures show that in each year since 1922, as currency fluctuations have diminished, so international trade has increased; and the total volume of merchandise exports and imports in 1927 was nearly 50 per cent, above the volume in 1922. There is every reason to believe that this tendency will continue, and that, with rising costs on the Continent and reorganised industries here, we shall be able to regain our fair share of the world&apos;s trade.
28. Surely it would be unthinkable at this stage, when we have got over the unpleasant; jolt;necessitated, by the reversion to the gold standard, for the . Govern-ment i toi treat the question as if it were in any respect an open one.* From the financial standpoint, the gold standard has increased the value of our capital claims on foreign countries by the equivalent of, say,  300- 400 millions, and has enabled the London bill again to take its place as the primary instrument of credit throughout the. world to the national profit. From the point of view of trade and industry, it has eliminated the risks of fluctuating exchanges, which went a long way to counterbalance any advantage resulting from depreciated wages. From the social standpoint, it has, as the Minister of Labour recognises, given the working classes in this country a definite improvement in their standard of living. Such difficulties as it has shown up were inherent in our industrial situation and would in any case have had to be faced sooner or later. There is not a shadow of doubt that, taken as a whole, reversion to the gold standard has already contributed materially to the national well-being; and as a practical matter, there is no possibility of going back on it. In the circumstances, surely the right policy is for the Government at every opportunity to claim credit for its achievement, instead of encouraging doubts and inviting criticisms.29. The same principle applies to the criticisms directed against the Bank of England. Having just persuaded Parliament to entrust the Bank again with full responsibility for the currency, surely it would be most inexpedient to open the door for fresh controversies by inviting a Committee of Industrialists to sit in judgment on the Bank&apos;s action in raising the rate of discount. It is well known that the Bank had for many months operated, and operated successfully, to avoid this painful necessity, but was finally forced to take action in order to protect us from the drain of gold attracted by higher rates to America and Germany. The necessity for the step has been generally recognised, even by those who usually are critical of the Bank&apos;s monetary policy.Febmary 23, 1929.* The same conclusion is reached on pp. 54 to 58 of the Final Report of the Committee on Industry and &apos;e, circulated as CP. 51 (29).
