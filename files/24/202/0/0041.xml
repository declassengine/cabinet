hi&apos;, i fa&quot;THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PRQPEP.TY 0? HIS BRITANNIC HAJ^SgYjS government&quot;ERI&quot;M joint)S E C H IS T.copy No,CcP. 91 (2.9).CABINET,.REDUCTION AND LIMITATION OP ARMAMENTS.COMMITTEE ON POLICYPOLICY  IN REGARD TO THE NEXT MEETING- OF THE PREPARATORYCOMMISSION.Report by the Chairman.Your Committee has held two sittings,  on February 27th and March i9th,  to review the instructions given to the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster for the forth-coming meeting of the Preparatory Commission,  on April 15th.It was felt that such a review was necessary,  owing to the length of time which had elapsed since the Committee had considered the Preparatory Commission&apos;s draft convention,  and    owing to the emergence of certain new factors.In the first place, your Committee had been informed that the German Delegation would almost certainly press for a &quot;second reading&quot; of the draft convention and that, in order that they might not be put off with the plea that progress could not be made in the absence of agreement on the naval problem,  they would propose that this problem be referred to a Sub-Committee consisting of the ropresentatives of the five Naval Powers,  thus enabling the main Committee to proceed with the rest of the work.In the second place, it had teen decided by His Majesty&apos;g Government - and this had been intimated to the French Government in December last - to take the line that the naval Powers, by the Treaty of Washington, had already accepted a measure of limitation, and indeed of
reduction,  and that it was  the turn of the militaryPowers to subject themselves to corresponding restrictions.If we were to maintain this attitude with effect,  itwas necessary to ensure that the British Delegation,while urging progress with military and air disarmament, notshould/be found,  or even appear,   to be obstructive in regard to proposals made to that end.As regards the proposal for a naval Sub-Committee, it was thought that,  if such a Sub-Committee were, appointed,  it might prove impossible to avoid a dis-cussion of the various aspects of the naval problem which have hitherto presented such difficulties and dangers. Your Committee therefore recommend that the British Delegate      be instructed to oppose any such suggestion,  on the ground that discussion of naval problems in such a Sub-Committee would serve no useful purpose unless it were preceded by diplomatic preparation.In regard to military and air problems, Your Committee are impressed with the necessity for placing the policy and achievements of Kis Majesty7s Government in the favourable light in which thej/ deserve to be shown.      His Majesty&apos;s Government have done as much and more than most Governments towards the reduction of armaments, and it ia for that very reason that no opportunity should be given, by opposition to plausible proposals for biassed critics to accuse them of obstruction.      Various proposals are due for discussion by the Preparatory Commission, which have not hitherto commended themselves to His Majesty&apos;s Government, but&apos;Your Committee were agreed that if any of these proposals.should secure the unanimous agreement of the other members,  the British Delegate should not,
&quot;by maintaining isolated opposition,  prevent their adoption by the Preparatory Commission as a whole and that he should announce to the Commission that, in so far as land and air armaments were concerned we would do our utmost to conform +0 what might be the desire of all the other Governments represented,. No one of the proposals awaiting discussion has yet secured the unanimous approval of the members of the Commission, and it is quite possible that none of them will do soa     We shall not, In that case, have to do violence to our principles by agree-ing to them.      But In any case, by intimating that we for our part will not prevent the attainment of unanimity, we shall obtain the credit due to us for our desire to promote the cause of disarmament *It was agreed that the British Delegate should take an opportunity3 at the outset, of making &amp; declaration to the Commission in this sense, and an outline of the declaration is annexed to this report 0      It would,,  of course, be necessary that that declaration should make it clear that our accommodating attitude in regard to land armaments was due to our peculiar situation - that we could not claim to be a military Power in the continental senseu      As regards air forces, we  should be ready to adjust our disarmament policy to that of other Powers,  since we considered that, though the air was of very special importance to the British Empire, our home defence problem could be regarded as broadly the same as that on the continent.      As regards naval matters, the peculiarity of our situation would of course operate in the opposite sense,  and we could not give any blind undertaking to accept the decisions of others.There is, as has been stated above, little likelihood that the Committee will be able to agree xmanimously on any of the very material points at issue0      In that event, your Committee are of the  opinion that it vrould be possible for the British Delegate to propose to the Preparatory Commission an alternative course that might afford a way round the difficulties which bar their progress./ See Annex.
The draft convention which the Commission has been trying now for the last two years to elaborate would, if the text were eventually approved on the lines of the existing draft, effect no reduction of armaments.      The signatories would only be accepting a limitation in principle - and a self-imposed limitation at that, for it has been repeatedly asserted and recognised that it would be for each signatory itself to fill in the figures in the &quot;Tables&quot; annexed to the Convention.      Those Tables would in fact be no more than an indication of the free intentions of each signatory State. The Preparatory Commission has met with hitherto insuperable difficulty in agreeing on the form of the Tables.      If agreement should now still prove unattainable, the British Delegate should urge on the Commission the disastrous effects of delay.      The principles of the limitation of air forces have been agreed - almost the only important point on which the Commission has reached agreement - and yet while the Gommissiion:pursues its   academic d.iscussions in regard to other arms and other topics,, we see the beginnings of a formidable race in air armaments.      If the Commission cannot agree on the form of the Tables,  let them agree to differ, and let each Government put forward its own programme of lands  naval and air armaments, for an agreed period, in the form which it considers best.      Doutbless Governments would follow those forms which had been unanimously adopted, and in other cases all Governments could be expected to meet fairly/
their obligations under Article 8 of the Covenant by giving the fullest and frankest possible statement of their intentions;    though differing in form, these would no doubt De designed honestly for the same purpose of removing suspicion and establishing mutual confidence.      The programmes might be accompanied by statements showing what each Government had already done towards the reduction of its own armaments.    It would be understood that,  if such a course were agreed to, and if all Governments submitted programmes in reasonable form, a Conference, should be summoned at which the participants might agree to bind themselves not to exceed those programmes for the agreed period,  save in case of emergency and with due notice to the other parties.The effect of such a submission of programmes might not be far removed from that of a convention on the lines of that which the Preparatory Commission has been trying to elaborate,  though there might not be the same scientific uniformity or completeness,      Nothing is to be gained by prolonging academic discussion, and the method of procedure by programmes would be a short cut to some concrete result.      It might arrest in its early stages a dangerous competition in .armaments;    none of the more reasonable advocates of disarmament have ever expected that the first disarmament convention would be more than the first step on a long road.An immediate decision on such a proposal cannot probably be expected, but if the Preparatory Commission would be otherwise faced once more with failure,  the British Delegate might submit this to them and ask them to reflect upon its possibilities.       An adjournment might
A-7Q*thus be secured, and His Majesty&apos;s Government could claim the credit of having made a practical and constructive proposal.(Signed)    SALISBURY.On behalf of the Committee.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1.22nd March,  1929.
ANNEX.OUTLINE OF THE DECLARATION TO BE ;&quot;AD?&apos; BY THE british representative;.It is suggested that the declaration to be made by the British Delegate might be on these linesAfter explaining why His Ha jo s by 1 s Government think it impossible to carry the discussion on the naval branch of the subject further at this moment, he might proceed as followsMany of the proposals before the Preparatory Commission have already been discussed at Geneva, and on a number of them there has been a divergence of views.      The British Delegates in the past have been obliged to express doubt as to the wlsdowm or justice of some of the suggestions made and to call attention to the difficulties that might be encountered In putting them into effect.      They have on their side made positive proposals which have likewise failed to obtain unanimous acceptance.,      On the whole, His Majesty !s Government have not seen reason to change the views which have hitherto been expressed on their behalf,If, however, a conclusion is to be reached, it is clear that where different opinions are held mutual adjustments and concessions must be made.The situation of all Governments here represented is not identical in respect of each of the three arms.      I will leave aside for the moment the question of air armaments, for in that sphere the Commission has provisionally In fact reached a large measure of agreement.      But on behalf of my Government I have a word to say on the question of land armaments Great Britain Is not a military Power in the
continental sense of the term.      Her military system itself is fundamentally different from that of most countries represented in the Commission,  and her land forces have suffered reduction to such a point that thev cannot claim to rival those of continental Powers. We recognise that in this sphere the lead must be taken by the great military powers, and that the possibility of effective limitation depends on the reconciliation of their views and policy,,      r&apos;e do not therefore desire to take a leading part in questions relating to land forces.      The all-import ant considera-tion to us is the attainment of such an agreement as will make progress possible, and though our own system is  so different from those of continental Powers, we feel confident that we shall be able to accept any proposals which meet with the unanimo\is assent of the other Powers present a      In these circumstances we  do not propose&apos; now to repea.t the arguments which Lord Cecil and I myself have used on earlier occasions in regard to the different points on which differences have arisen.      By the adoption of this attitude, His Majesty&apos;s Government hope to facilitate agreement in the&apos;Comraission, and whilst reserving their right to examine the results of the Commission&apos;s labours as a whole, I repeat that His Majesty&apos;s Government will endeavour to accept,  and feel confident that they will be able to accept, any scheme which meets with the approval of the rest of the Commission.The members of the Commission will reaiise that what  I have said about the special position of his country in the military sphere applies differently from the naval sphere,,      Here at the proper time we
must of necessity claim to have a larger voice in what Is a matter of vital interest to us. We are anxious, and indeed determined, to find a solution of the naval problem,  and we hope to ta] an active part in Its realisation if time be given to us to overcome difficulties\ilties which have hitherto prevented agreement.
