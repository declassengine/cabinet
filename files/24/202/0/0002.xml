C R S T. P. 52 (29).COPY WO,CAB I II S TTHE AFFAIRS OF THE BRITISH GROUP OF THE ^TERi-PARLiA^OTARY UNION oemorandum by the Se  ^etar^of State for Foreign Affairs.Sir Arthur Shirley Berm and Colonel Vaughan Morgan have recently approached me in regard to &quot;the affairs of the British group of the.Inter-Parliamentary Union,They have pointed out In the first place that if it is thought desirable that the British group should continue it is their opinion that the grant of  -300 per annum which has hitherto been made by His Majesty1s Government must be increased.     The present grant of  300 compares very unfavourably with, the large amounts promised by the United States of America, and France, 20,000 dollars and 500,000 francs respectively..In the second place they drew my attention to the fact that they anticipate difficulty with the new President of the Inter-Parliamentary Union as he has Informed the Head Office of the Union in Geneva and the Secretary-General that he considers the Union should chscuss the matters of the moment that the various Governments will have to deal with.,  the idea being to let  the Governments know of the feeling among their supporters and opponents in their own Parliaments0Thirdly they are anxious for my advice In a matter to be brought before the Executive of the British group of the Inter-Parliamentary Union at its next meeting, namely certain correspondence which l\as been passing between-1-
Commander Kenworthy and Congressman Britten in regard to a meeting between the British and American groups of the Union to discuss the naval situation and the cognate subject of international law at sea.I feel it necessary to consult my colleagues before coming to a final decision as to the reply I should make to Sir Arthur Shirley Benn and Colonel Vaughan Morgan to the points they have raised.So far as the question of the grant is concerned the Foreign Office have opposed rather than favoured the grant, When it was originally made in 1909 by the then Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr, LYioyd George, Sir Edward Gr-sy was not consulted, and was opposed to the idea when he heard of it. Nevertheless once made he agreed it should be continued unless anything were done to make its continuance undesirablec During the war the grant was suspended but it was revived in 1921.     Lord Curzon?who was consulted in regard to the renewal, confined himself to stating that he was content to leave the matter to the decision of the Treasury since no political considerations of sufficient weight could be urged to justify a recommendation for a renewal of the grant.From the Foreign Office point of view I see no reason to modify    the opinion expressed in 1921 by Lord Curzon. On the  contrary the question seems to me to arise whether the time has not come to consider the suspension of the grant altogether, having regard to the activities in which certain members of the British group are engagingo     Ho really effective means occur to me of preventing the Union and its members from engaging in discussions such as those referred to in the second and third points to which Sir Arthur Shirley Benn and Colonel Vaughan Morgan have drawn my attention, but
there is no apparent reason shy His Majesty&apos;s Government should facilitate those activities by contributing from Government funds for their continuance.(Intld.)      AoC.Foreign Office, S.W01, February 22ndy  1929,&quot;O-
