The Contribution Qualification.I draw the attention of my colleagues to the Memorandum which. I circulated last November an the subject of the 39 Contributions rule (C.P. 533 (28)).      It is new necessary to decide what course is te be taken.The Unemployment Insurance Act,  1927,  following the unanimous recommendation of the Blaneeburgh Committee provides that sne of the narmal conditions for the receipt of benefit shall be the payment of 30 contributions during the twe years immediately preceding the date of a claim for benefit.In view of the depression which existed when the 1927 Act was passed and of the large numbers who would have lost benefit if the full 30 contributions condition had been imposed at once, the Act provided that during a transitional period a modified contribution condition should apply In- the case of persons of 18 years of age and over, viz. the payment of 8 contributions in the last two years or 3C at any time.      The full rule has been in operation in the oase of juveniles under 18 since April last.The Act of 1*27 was passed on 22nd December, 1927,  sa that sixteen months&apos; notice was given cf what was to happen next month.      It was always realised that a number ef pewple In receipt ef benefit would fail te qualify under the rule and cease te draw benefit.      I am being pressed with increasing frequency to give an estimate of the number who will fail to quailfy and te say what actien the Gcrvernment propose to take.Prom a sample analysis taken on 20th January,  1929, it is estimated that if the full condition had been applied to. the whale ef the register on that day about 110,000 persons  (including
(some 7,000 women) then in receipt of benefit would have failed to qualify-      This figure must not be misunderstood.      It is not the number who would be disqualified at a stroke on 19th April,  1929. The disqualifieation would take place gradually and at a fairly uniform rate over the twelve months beginning at that date so that, at a maximum,  there would be about 9^000 disqualifications a month during the year.For various reasons,  such as the effect of the transfer scheme, the stimulus to make up the balance of 30 contributions (where the claimant is only a few short of them), and, so far as it materialises, an Improvement in trade ^ the number actually disqualified would,  I am confident, prove to be less than 110,000, But even so I am afraid it is too large a figure to enable us to bring the 30 contributions rule into operation., as the existing law provides, next Aprili      Apart from the mere size of the figure, it is largely concentrated, in a few areas and principally in Durham and in South Wales 0At the same time,  I am quite sure that we ought to do something more than postpone again the operation of the rule.We must take a step forward,,      The really disquieting thing aboutthe present situation is that in a few areas there are considerableaggregations of men who are becoming demoralised by long idlenessat the public expense, and who will remain in their present condition so long as the^r can go on drawing benefit  (or poorrelief where it Is given).      One of the safeguards of the insurancescheme  (viz.  that claimants must be &quot;genuinely seeking work&quot;)is largely ineffective in these areas.      There is no worlc for themwhere they are.      The only hope for them is to get work elsewhere,In this country or overseas;    but they lack either the fitnessor the energy to seek this for themselves, and so long as they canlive at the public expense they refuse to take advantage of anyof the forms of help under the training and transferenceschemes which are continually being pressed upon them.o -
It is the existence of this class which swells the numbers affected by the thirty contributions rule so that it is difficult to apply it - the others so affected are mostly scattered over the country in small numbers and would not be a serious difficulty.      But it is the continued grant of benefit on lax contribution conditions which maintains this class in existence and it is essential, in their own and in the national interests, that we should take any steps which is practicable tc bring a stricter rule into force, and provide the needed incentive to transfer.So far the point has not been stressed that on insurance principles there is no justification for relaxing the rule any longer.     But the point is one that must not be overlooked and It is reinforced by the -fact that the Unemployment Fund is practically bankrupt - as I mention later in this note, its expenditure is much above its income,  and we may have to pass an Act this Session again increasing the borrowing powers, which were put up by 10 millions to 40 millions by the Act of last November.   We must take off the Fund some of the illegitimate burden which it is now carrying in the form of persons without the proper contribution qualification.I have examined the possibility of bringing the 30 contributions rule into force in April next by a series of numerical steps - for example, making the qualifying number 10 in the first year and 20 in the second year,  and not reaching 30 till the third year.      The objection to this,  I am afraid,  is that it would disqualify, over the first year, some 36,000 persons, most of whom   would be In Durham and South Wales,  and about two-thirds of whom would be men with dependentsThe mere total would not bo fatal in itself but those affected would largely consist of married men with
families living in the distressed areas;    they are just the oases which would attract the greatest amount of public sympathy and from whom it is hardest to do anything under the transference scheme.This  consideration, however,  leads to what I think is the right solution, namely, that we should postpone the operation of the rule for men and women with dependents, but not for those without   dependents.      Those without dependents are those who most need a stimulus to galvanise them out of their inertia,  they will deserve and get the least degree of public sympathy and they are the class most easily handled by the Transference Scheme.According tc the best estimate that can be made,  of the 110,000 persons who according to the sample analysis would be disqualified (not,   of course,  at once but gradually over 12 months) by the full rule,  about 40,000 would, be persons without dependents,  of whom about 16,000 would be in South ?;ale3 and Durham and the other depressed mining areas  .As regards the remainder, who are distributed throughout the country,  the local opportunities sf cmploy-ment are,   In general,  sufficient to remove the&quot; from the category of hardship.There will be more difficulty with regard to the persons in Durham and South Wnles and the other depressed mining areas who must,  In general, be transferred to other districts if they are to enter employment,  and,  Incidentally, acquire their contribution qualification.      Under rry proposals, those immediately affected will be men without dependents who are naturally the most easily transferable.-4-
Moreover, as I have said above,  they are those whom it is most desirable not to allow to remain settled down in idleness where they are.Persons i^ithout dependents are those who should be prepared to move.&apos;     We are trying to help this class and are meeting with a large measure of success,      The places we have found (or which they can find for themselves) here and overseas enable us to say that the operation of the thirty contributions&apos;   condition in their case will really involve no hardship..With regard to the persons with dependents numbering probably about 70,000,  I propose to extend the trans ition-al pe-period for another year during which they would have to show,  as at present,  that they have paid eight contributions in the lasttwo years or thirty at some time.      During the following year,  i.e.  commencing in April,  1930, they would be required to show, as their benefit years expire,  that they had paid fifteen contributions in the preceding two years.      In the next year,  i.e,,  that commencing April,  1931,  the full thirty contributions 1  condition would apply.     This would mean that the full effect of the condition would not be felt by any persons with dependents until April,  1931,  and by all of them,  not till April,  19320      If pressed in the House, we could extend these transitional arrangements by yet another year  (making the steps 10,  20,  30,   Instead of 15,  30) but I should propose to have two steps only In the Bill as introduced.
Shortly, what we should do would be as followsGlass,TreatmentMen and Women without dependents .Condition to operate as from 19th April,  1929*Men and vfomen with dependents.Continue transitional period and present conditions for one year0      Thereafter bring the rule into operation gradually over the following two years.This is without doubt the right course of action and it Is really vital both on public grounds end in the interests of the depressed areas themselves that a start should be made i  am, however,  bound to warn mj colleagues of the use that mav be made against us of a proposal which on the face of it might deprive 40,000 single persons of benefit in the course of the following 12 monthsc      On the other hand we are conceding the main point,  viz, a complete extension for a year In the case of all those who most dese rve consideration.The proposals I have made mean a short Bill which should,  if possible, be passed before we adjourn for Easter and I ask for authority to instruct Parliamentary Counsel to prepare a Bill accordingly,,The Bill itself will doubtless be treated as contro-versial, but opposition will be limited by the necessity of it being passed before the appointed day0While the above is all I ask for now I must at the sane time call the attention of the Cabinet  (as I did in my Memoranda of 1st November last  (CP,324  (23)  and 16th January (CP.6  (29))  to the fact that to render the transference scheme successful  (a)  great resolution is needed,  and (b) schemes of new work are required In the areas to which it is proposed to move the men.
Moreover,  the discussion of this question has again brought to light the necessity - which the Minister&quot; of Health and  I have prominently in mind - of examining afresh the position of able-bodied unemployed who for any reason are outside the scope of the Unemployment Insurance Scheme, with a view to determining the steps to be taken to deal with them.B.      Financial position of the Unemployment Fund.    By an Act passed on the 28th November,  1928, the borrowing powers wore increased by  10,000,000 to  40,000,000.      The dobt is now  34,650,000 so that nearly half of the increase has already been exhausted..      The Live Register was up to 1,455,000 on 18th February having risen to that figure from 1,342,000 In the previous week ov/ing to frost.If the Live Register from now on is as high as 1,300,000 on the average, the borrowing powers will last until August.      It seems,  therefore,  that it would  be premature to legislate now for a further increase but it will be necessary to examine the situation with care after Easter in the light of(a)    the unemployment situation at that time and fb)    the date when the new Parliament will have to meet for other purposes.If there is any reasonable chance that the borrowing powers will bo exhausted before the new Parliament can add to them, it will bo necessary to introduce a one clause Bill to grant a further increase, up to at least j:50, 000,000.I recommend that we decide not to legislate on the subject now in spite of the risk - slight I hope - of a second Bill later.(Intd . ) A.
