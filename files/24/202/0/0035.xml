[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;b Government, jPrinted for the Cabinet.   March 1929.Copy No.    28CP. 85 (29).CABINET.THE CONDITIONS OF A RESORT TO WAR.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I UNDERTOOK some time ago to place before my colleagues a more precise statement than that which I then made verbally to the Cabinet of the restrictions which, by our signature of the Covenant or of other international engagements, we have voluntarily placed upon our right to resort to war for the defence of British interests.The attached memorandum is circulated in fulfilment of this undertaking.It is not pretended that these engagements, so widely signed by ourselves and others, make war impossible no treaties can ever do that but they make resort to war infinitely more perilous. No Government, no British Government at any rate, can now contemplate recourse to war except after compliance with the conditions laid down by the Covenant and in circumstances which enable it to confront without apprehension that inquest into its policy and conduct which must take place before the Council of the League.A. C.March 17, 1929.Memorandum.Prior to 1914 there were in effect no treaty restrictions on the right of His-Majesty&apos;s Government to enforce their policy by recourse to war if they saw fit to do so. The provision which appeared in a certain number of old treaties, that &quot;there shall be perpetual peace and friendship between the High Contracting Parties,&apos;&apos; was not in practice regarded as inconsistent with a declaration of war by one Party on the other. His Majesty&apos;s Government were bound by a certain number of bilateral treaties providing for the submission to arbitration of certain classes of disputes, but, as disputes affecting the &apos;&apos; vital interests, independence or honour of the High Contracting Parties&quot; were invariably excluded from the scope of such treaties, it remained open to His Majesty&apos;s Government to go to war on account of any matter which, in their judgment, fell within these exceptions.The position to-day is very different. The efforts which have been made since the close of the war to eliminate war as an instrument of national policy, or at any rate to diminish the possibility of its occurrence, have now produced a situation in which any British Cabinet, before deciding to have recourse to war, must carefully consider : (a) Whether the circumstances are such that they can, without a breach of their treaty obligations, go to war at all, and (b) what procedure it is incumbent upon them to adopt if they wish to comply with their treaty obligations before resorting to hostilities. It is proposed accordingly to consider : (I) The existing treaty provisions which limit the right of His Majesty&apos;s Government to have recourse to war; (II) The procedure which it is incumbent on His Majesty&apos;s Government to adopt before, under their existing treaty commitments, a recourse to war on their part would become legitimate.4803   [19014]CONFIDENTIAL.
I. Treaty Restrictions on the Right to have Recourse to War.(A.) The &quot; Kellogg Peace Pact.&quot;This is not yet actually in force, and, in the absence of any experience of its working, it is difficult to be precise as to its exact effect. But such doubts as exist relate rather to the way it will work in practice than to the legal situation which it creates. Under article 1, the parties (a) &quot; Condemn recourse to war for the solution of international controversies&quot;; (b) &quot;Renounce it as an instrument of national policy in their relations with one another.&quot; For the purposes of this paper, it is not necessary to discuss (a), as its effect is rather moral than legal, and article 2, under which the parties agree that the solution of any disputes between them shall never be sought except by pacific means, does not, in the absence of any provision in the Treaty itself for the settlement of such disputes, affect the present question, though it may well prove in practice the most important provision in the Treaty. For present purposes we only have to deal with 1 (b). According to the agreed interpretation of this provision, it does not exclude : (i) War in self-defence (which phrase, in our case, is extended to cover the defence of our special interests in certain defined regions); (ii) war against a Power which has itself gone to war in violation of the Pact. In order, therefore, to be legitimate under the Pact, a war must be capable of being brought within one or other of these two categories. It is, of course, possible that war may break out in such circumstances that it may be difficult to decide which of the belligerents has violated his obligations under the Pact, but it is not unlikely that the test applied will be the willingness or otherwise of the parties to resort to arbitration or conciliation as indicated in Clause 2. the difficulty may be further diminished by the operation of the provisions of the Covenant.(B.) The Covenant of the League of Nations.The Covenant does not absolutely forbid recourse to war, but it provides certain machinery for preserving the peace, which must be allowed to operate before a Member of the League can go to war without violating its obligations. For this reason the importance of the Covenant falls rather into the second half of our subject, but the provisions which restrict the right to go to war are as follows :  Article 10, by which the Members undertake to respect and preserve, as against external aggression, the territorial integrity and existing political independence of all Members of the League. The exact effect of this article is still a matter of discussion; for our present purpose its importance is that, according to the Report of the Committee on Amendments to the Covenant in September 1921, its intention is &quot; to enunciate the principle that, hereafter, the civilised world cannot tolerate acts of aggression as a means of modifying the territorial statvs quo and the political independence of the States.&apos;&apos;Articles 12, 13 and 15. Under these articles every dispute between Members of the League which is likely to lead to a rupture must be submitted either to arbitration* or to enquiry by the Council, and the Members agree in no case to resort to war until three months after the award by the arbitrators or the report by the Council. The Members also agree not to go to war with a Member which complies with any arbitral award that may be rendered or with the recommendations of the Council, if these are agreed to by all the Members of the Council other than the parties to the dispute.Under article 17, in the event of a dispute between a Member and a non-Member, the latter is to be invited to accept the obligations of membership for the purposes of the dispute, and, if the invitation is accepted, the provisions above referred to apply.The effect for present purposes of the above provisions is that we can only legitimately go to war (1) in a case where the other party declines to comply with an arbitral award or a unanimous recommendation by the Council; (2) if the Council fails to reach a unanimous recommendation; and, in both cases, we cannot go to war until three months after the award or the CounciFs report. If a State resorts to war in violation of its obligations under the Covenant, the sanctions provided by article 16 are applicable.* &quot;Arbitration&quot; is here used as including judicial settlement.
II. Procedure idhich must be Adopted before Recourse may Legitimately be had to War.The Kellogg Pact provides no machinery for securing its observance, though article 2 implies that pacific means of settling disputes are to be employed in every case. The procedure under the Bryan Treaties has been described above. There remains the machinery provided by the Covenant.Under article 12 of the Covenant every dispute between Members likely to lead to a rupture must be submitted either to arbitration* or to enquiry by the Council. Such a dispute, if of a justiciable character, may go to arbitration either because it is covered by some arbitration provision which is binding on the parties, or because they agree in the particular case to submit it to arbitration. If the dispute does not go to arbitration the parties are bound to bring it before the Council for enquiry. But apart from this there are other means by which a serious dispute can be brought before the Council. Under article 11 any war or threat of war is declared a matter of concern to the whole League, and the League &apos;&apos; shall take any action that may be deemed wise and effectual to safeguard the peace of nations.&quot; In such an eventuality the Secretary-General is bound, on the request of any Member of the League, forth-with to summon a meeting of the Council, and under the same article any Member of the League may bring to the attention of the Assembly or the Council any circumstance which threatens to disturb the peace.It will be seen, therefore, that any dispute between Members of the League, which is likely to lead to war, is certain to be brought before the Council in one of the above ways, and if this is done the Council is bound to act. In the case of a dispute between a Member and a non-Member the latter has, under article 17, to be invited to accept the obligations of membership for the purposes of the dispute, and if the invitation is accepted the same procedure applies.The cases which have already occurred give some indication as to the action which the Council is likely to take in such circumstances. A meeting of the Council is summoned by telegraph at the most convenient spot, and the first pre-occupation of the Council is to prevent an actual outbreak of hostilities or to ensure their cessation if they have already broken out. This may be done, for instance, by a pressing recommendation to the disputants to withdraw their forces within their own frontiers or to establish a neutral zone between them, perhaps subject to some form of League supervision. Detailed schemes for this sort of action have been for some time under consideration, but involve certain difficulties, especially as regards naval forces. Experience seems to show, however, and it is in the nature of things probable, that it is difficult for the disputants to withstand pressure of this sort by the Council, and that (apart from the provisions of the Covenant which impose a definite delay before hostilities can legitimately be opened) it should normally be possible for the Council to ensure the preservation of peace for a period which will allow it to perform the function imposed upon it by article 15, of endeavouring to effect a settlement of the dispute. This procedure is, of course, what is called &quot; conciliation &quot;; the Council has no compulsory powers and its efforts may or may not effect a settlement of the dispute. If it is not thus settled, the Council has to make and publish a report containing a statement of the facts of the dispute and of its recommendations in regard thereto. If the report is unanimously adopted by the Members of the Council other than the disputants, and one party complies with the recommendations of that report, the other party cannot, without violating the Covenant, go to war. If the report is not unanimous (in the above sense) the parties can go to war, but not until three months after the report has been made.* &quot; Arbitration &quot; is here used as including judicial settlement.The &quot;Bryan&quot; Treaties.These are in force only with the United States and Brazil. They provide for the reference of all disputes, which are not otherwise settled, to a Permanent Inter-national Commission. The functions of the Commission are confined to investigation and report. For present purposes the importance of these Treaties is that the Commission has a year in each case in which to complete its report, and the parties agree not to go to war during this period.
III. Summary.It results from the above that before having recourse to war a British Cabinet must take the following steps : (a.) Carefully consider whether the circumstances are such as to enable them to go to war without violating their obligations under the Kellogg Pact.(6.) If the dispute is with the United States or Brazil, arrange for the dispute to be referred to the Commission established under the Bryan Treaties and await the report of the Commission before going to war.(c.) If the dispute is with a Member of the League, either arrange for it to be referred to arbitration or judicial settlement, or bring it before the Council for enquiry. If the dispute is with a non-Member, take steps to have the country in question invited to accept the obligations of membership of the League for the purposes of the dispute.If neither party to the dispute brings it before the Council (the dispute not having been submitted to arbitration), each would have violated his obligations under the Covenant, but the matter could, and probably would, be brought before the Council by another Member under article 11. In that case it would be the duty of this country to send a representative to attend the Council meeting and take part in its deliberations.If the dispute is referred to arbitration and the other party complies with the arbitral award, we could not go to war with him without violating article 13.If the Council makes a report which is agreed to by all its Members other than the representatives of the two disputants, and the other disputant complies with this report, we could not go to war with him without violating article 15. If the Council fails to make such a unanimous report we can go to war, but not for three months.Finally, it may be recalled that methods of putting pressure on another State have been adopted in the past which, though of a forcible character, fall short of war, such, for instance, as a naval demonstration. Such measures are not necessarily excluded by the treaty provisions referred to in this memorandum, but if they are taken in.future, the State against whom they are directed, if a Member of the League, will be able to bring the matter at once before the Council, and, whether or not that State is a Member of the League, any Member could take similar action under article 11 of the Covenant.A.
