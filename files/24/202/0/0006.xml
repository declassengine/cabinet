THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY5S GOVERNMENT,CRET.. 56 (29),CABINET. Copy lJOt  MClauses in Private Bills and Scottish Provisional Orders protecting Road Transport Undertakingsfrom competition.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY Off STATE FOR SCOTLAND.1,     The Memorandum &quot;by the Minister of Transport, C.P.50 (29) raises a question of considerable importance and urgency in connection with current private legislation.2.     In addition to the local and private Bills to which the Minister&apos;s Memorandum specially refers, eight draft Provisional Orders under the Private Legislation Procedure (Scotland) Act containing similar clauses for the restriction of competition have been deposited r.nd will in ordinary course be the subject Of Inquiry held in Scotland in April.       Departmentally the question of transport palicy involved is primarily one for the Minister of Transport.     Under tho Scottish procedure the Orders fall to be made by me but they require confirmation by Parliament and if Parliament, at the instance of the Government, gave suoh an instruction as the Minister suggests the principle of that instruction would be applicable to the Scottish Provisional Orders as well as to private Bills in Parliament.     My departmental responsibility in the matter is therefore only a limited one. I desire, however, to bring to the notice of my colleagues some general considerations which may be material to their decision on the proposal made in C.P.50 (29),3,     I agree as to the importance and the difficulty of the problem created by the clauses in the English Private Bills and the Scottish Provisional Orders.     If Parliament follows the three existing precedents and grants the power sought   a considerable number of local authorities and companies will secure something approaching a monopoly of omnibus traffics of a character more or less permanent;    and other local authorities and companies may soon seek similar powers.     These vested rights may seriously impede the action of the Government and of Parliament in the future in dealing with the traffic problem following on such recommenda-tions as the Royal Commission may be able to make,I agree therefore that some general instruction by Parliament to Committees on private Bills is desirable.4.     It appe^.rs to me, however, that a general instruction that such clauses should be entirely disallowed in all cases may go too far.     Eor ex*japle, cases are occurring in Scottish Burghs in which the Corporation, faced with serious competition from private omnibuses, have to decide either to work (or to discontinue) their tramways at a heavy loss or themselves to provide omnibus services under existing or additional statutory powers.     If, as may commonly happen, they choose the latter alternative a continuance of competition between the municipal and the privateomnibus/
omnibus services may frequently result in (l) further losses to the municipality and its ratepayers and (2) congestion of traffic and danger to the public.     In these circumstances the Corporation of Perth last year sought and obtained statutory power to restrict competition on specified routes.     Two other Corporations (Dundee and Ayr) are how seeking generally similar powers.     If the Government move Parliament to instruct Committees entirely to refuse such pbwers such Promoters may assert * with some justification, - that the action of the ^Government has thrown upon the municipalities and their ratepayers serious and continuing losses and upon1 the public, the Svils of\ congest!oh and danger in the, streets.     The advantages of the method of. restricting competition are recognised by the Minister In his Memorandum and, to some extent, by the Chairman of the Royal Commission, and Parliament accepted the principle In three bases last year.     A situation similar to that which affects Local Authorities may arise in the caso of tramway, and omnibus services worked on specified routes by companies under statutory pOwd-rs.5.     In these circumstances I am disposed to think that some altei^native to the remedy suggested in the Minister of transport&apos;s Memorandum merits consideration.      A course which prevented ihe creation of a quasi-monopoly of permanent or of long.duratibh might mast the oase-;     This might be $ecured either: by making the powers Subject tb review after the Royal Commission has reported or by limiting their duration to a few years so that the ground may be left clear for consideration in the light, of the Royal Commisslon*s recommendations.     A general instruction limited in some such manner might sufficiently preserve the status quo, and would appear to me to be more, easily defensible than the wider one suggested in C.P.50(29). Its effect would be to determine the maximum powers to be allowed. The Committees on private Bills (and Commiseloners on Soottish Provisional Orders) would of course be free to rejoot such clauses entirely where a oase was not established to their satisfaction; Ct to insert safeguards, e.g,, for the protection of through traffic or of existing interests.JOIST GILMOUR-.Scottish Office,25th february, 1929.
