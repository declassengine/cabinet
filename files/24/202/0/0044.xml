[ ThisJOocoment is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.   March 1929.SECRET.Copy No.28CP. 94 (29).I circulate to Cabinet a letter addressed by Herr von Kiihlmann to* Sir William Tyrrell.I propose to raise the matter at to-morrow&apos;s Cabinet.A. C.Foreign Office, Monday, March 25, 1929.Herr von Kiihlmann to Sir W. Tyrrell.Dear Sir William,Paris, March 19, 1929.It occurred to me that it may seem advisable to summarise some, of the points touched upon in our conversations during the financial experts&apos; conference.I am informed by members of delegations to this conference that Dr. Schacht has been able to show in a very conclusive way how heavily the German trade balance suffered from the utter lack of territories producing raw materials and how adversely Germany&apos;s ability to pay reparations was affected by this state of things.This conference does not deal with political questions, but Germany&apos;s ability to carry in the future the heavy load to be imposed upon her by the Young pian would be considerably increased if in future Germany could dispose under her own control of areas giving a reasonable supply of raw materials. It seems, therefore, highly desirable that the experts&apos; conference should express in its findings a vceti that means should be considered in the future to assure to Germany a reasonable supply of raw materials.Conversations with French politicians have shown sympathy with such proposals. As from the American side hardly any opposition is to be expected, so the vceu seems to have serious chances to be passed.At the same time, it seems advisable to give a rough outline of what Germany&apos;s hopes and aims are in the field of colonial policy.The Versailles Treaty, as far as it deals with colonies, has only provided temporary arrangements which some day must make place for more permanent settlements. The German people have frequently been assured from high authorities that in future a friendly co-operation between England, France and Germany shall form the permanent basis of future European policy, so they consider themselves entitled to hope that no permanent change of territory in Africa shall take place in which they have not had their due place in the council.Only a dreamer could hope that any such settlement could ignore the results of the Great War. On the other hand, the opening up of reasonable prospects for colonial development would make it much easier for the German nation to accept the heavy burdens of the Young plan, whatever the definite burdens of this plan may be. The fact that in pre-war time long negotiations between the British and German Governments concerning colonial questions had led to a complete agreement laid down in initialled conventions may give ground for the hope that such ideas may now receive careful consideration by the British Government.4815   [19038]
In regard to the former German South-West Africa, no more may be said for the present than that Germany presents no claim as long as the South African Union hold the mandate over this territory.The case of Togo and Cameroon is different. There is a strong and lasting desire that they may form again German colonial territory. At the same time, it would seem highly desirable to examine together with the British Government how far the stipulations of the Anglo-German pre-war agreements concerning Angola may be adapted to present circumstances.On the East Africa coast the British desire for the possession of former German East Africa has caused a good deal of international discussion. An arrangement seems not impossible, provided that the southern part of this territory and the Nyassa country should return into the German sphere in a form to be agreed upon. At the same time, the pre-war agreements concerning the Portuguese colonies lying to the south of this territory should be brought up to date.To resume : the acceptance of the Young plan would be considerably facilitated if (a) the British Government was ready to co-operate by friendly advice in the direction that the finding of the experts may contain a vceu pointing out that it would be desirable to have Germany&apos;s participation in the control of territories giving supply of raw materials, and (b) the British Government should give to understand in a strictly confidential fashion that they will use their best endeavours, should the question of permanent settlements in Africa come up for discussion, to see that the main lines of the policy outlined here shall be made the basis of a lasting settlement.Believe me, my dear Ambassador, with kindest regards,Yours very sincerely.KtJHLMANN.His Excellency the British Ambassador, Sir Wiiliam Tyrrell, Paris.
