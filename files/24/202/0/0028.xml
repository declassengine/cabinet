EHI8 DOCUMENT 13 TEE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)S 3 C RT.COPY NO.fl.?.  76 (29).CABINT.THE ATTITUDE OP THE .PRENCH GOVERiCMBNT REGARDING THE PROPOSED BAGDAD-HAIFA RAILWAY AND PIPELINE.Note by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I would invite the attention of the Cabinet when considering Mr.. Arnery&apos;s paper CP. 75 (29) to the attached Foreign Office memorandum.The policy recommended by the Colonial Office seems to me certain to involve us in serious trouble with the French and Americans and unlikely to provide a single compensatory advantage,I strongly support the policy of negotiation proposed by Sir W.  Tyrrell.(Intd.)    A.C.-eign Office, S.W..1 h March,  1929.
Tlle Attitude of the French Government regarding Jthe proposed Bagdad&quot;Ual&quot;fa Railway and Pipe line *In the course of the negotiations for the extension of the time limit, fixed for the selection by the Turkish Petroleum Company of their oil plots In Iraq, which expired In November 1928, and was then temporarily extended by the Iraqi Government to March 6th,  1929,  a provisional basis of agreement was reached, last November, between the Company and the Iraqi government 2,      By this arrangement the Company was to obtain first an extension of two years9  in return for an undertaking, during that time, to carry out the necessar^ survey for the construction of a railway from Bagdad to the Mediterranean;   to be followed by a second extension of three years, in return for an under-taking to proceed, during those three years, to the actual construction of such a railway.3o     The Iraqi Government have hitherto desired that this railway should run from Bagdad to Haifa?    and this Haifa alignment was,  In fact, specified as one of the essential conditions of the grant of the proposed extension,  in a resolution of the Iraqi Council of Ministers of August 13s  1928. Hi3 Majesty&apos;s Government are anxious to secure the Haifa ailgn-ment both in the Iraqi and in the Imperial interest0      Owing, however, to the opposition of the French group in the Turkish Petroleum Company to any mention of the Haifa alignment in the body of the agreement with the Iraqi Government,  the Company desired that the question of the alignment should be dealt with In a separate letter,  to be attached to the agreement.     A draft letter (Annex A) was accordingly put forward by the Board of the Turkish Petroleum Company (including&apos;the French group), providing that,  &quot;among the surveys to be made of the line of a railway from  B-agdad to the Mediterranean, a survey shall bemade from Bagdad to Haifa.&quot;-2-
4.     The Colonial Office considered that this draft did not sufficiently guarantee the ultimate adoption cf the Haifa alignment,   t&amp;which the Iraqi Government desired.      It was accordingly decided that an effort should be made to induce the Board to revise this draft letter, and the matter was discussed, early in November, with Sir John Cadman, who eventually agreed to arrange for the substitution of a revised draft letter (Annex B), providing that the survey should &quot;be made,  in the first instance,  O.....o from Bagdad to Haifa,  and that a complete project for the construction cf a railway on that route&quot; should be submitted during the initial two years&apos; period.      Sir Jo Cadman, as Chairman of the Board,  instructed the Bagdad representative of the Company to adopt this revised draft,  and/Undertook to secure the concurrence of his Board thereto.     With this object in view, he wrote to his French colleague,  on November 9,  that it was desirable that the Board should accept the new draft letter &quot;in order tc obtain the full support cf the &quot; Mandatory Power&quot;,,5,      It was at this stage that Sir Js  Cadman was unable tc carry the French directors  with him and the French Government intervened, protesting, through the French Ambassador in London,  against what they described as the political inter-ference of His Majesty&apos;s Government in negotiations,   vhich thev considered should have been of a purely economic character, between the Turkish Petroleum Company and the Iraqi Govern-ment.      They asked that the question should be &quot;replacee sur le terrain economique&quot;, and that the Turkish Petroleum Company should be dispensed from the obligation to give any definite preference to the Haifa alignments6.      After much-ii discussion with the Colonial Office,  a final reply was sent to M. de Flouriau on January 12,  informing
to350him that His rcajesty&apos;s Government could not meet what appeared to be the wishes of the French Government, and intervene with the Iraqi Government and the Turkish Petroleum Company with a view tc securing the cancellation of the revised draft letter  (Annex B) providing for priority of survey for the Haifa route.      It was explained(i) that the Turkish Petroleum Company were anxious to obtain a valuable concession from the Iraqi Government;(ii) that the original draft letter (Annex A)  did not sufficiently guarantee that the Iraqi Government would   in fact secure the fulfilment of the condition on which they were prepared to consider according that concession; (ill) that the Iraqi Government were clearly entitledto demand their own terms in return for according m.p. and (iv)  that His Majestyfs Government *:ould not have been justified in urging them to accept a fcr^ of undertaking which did net comply with their requirements.      It was added that the Turkish Petroleum Company were in any case free to decide whether the value of the two years&quot; extension was sufficient to justify the guarantee demanded,  or,  indeed, whether it was financially desirable for &quot;them to construct any railway at all,7o      Cn the receipt of this communication M. Berthelot,  on behalf of the French Government took up the -question personally with His Majesty&apos;3 Ambassador in Paris.      He explained that the French Government believed that the Iraqi Government were by no means so determined to secure the Haifa alignment as had been represented, and that they were in fact qlite indifferent 00 the question of the draft letters.      The action of His Majesty&apos;s Government In bringing pressure to bear on the Company to give preference to the-4-
Haifa survey could only be regarded by the French Government  as a grave interference with the Company&apos;s freedom of action in a sphere which, under the San&amp;emo Agreement,  should haVe remained purely economic The French Government had hoped that Franco-British solidarity had been established in the Near East, and that such questions as arose would iii fdture be settled by methods of reciprocal concession and co--operatione His Majesty&apos;s Government&apos;s attitude on the present question had caused the French Government painful surprisec     With a final hint at the possibility of the British group in the Turkish Petroleum Company finding themselves faced with a hostile combination of French and American interests, M0 Berthelot put forward a strongly worded request that the Company should be informed of Its complete freedom of action, more especially in so far as concerned the possible withdrawal of the revised draft letter (Annex B--) and allowed In futu to retain full liberty to deal with its own Interests in whatever way it thought best on purely economic grounds^ as provided by the international understandings dealing with the natter., .8.      On the receipt of this  communication, thd whole question of the policy to be adopted vis-a-vis the French Government was carefully reviewed in the Foreign Office,  and a letter was written to the Colonial Office, on February 6, drawing attention to.the fact that the advantages of maintaining the revised draft letter might well be outweighed by the dangers to the prospects of the Bagdad-Haifa railway which would be Inevitable if a serious dispute with the French Government were allowed to develop.      It was therefore suggested that an effort should be made to find some solution of the difference which had arisen with the French Government by compromise. -5-
9.      The Colonial Office replied on February 18th dissenting from this view, which they regarded as involving complete capitulation to the French. The difference with the French Government on this question was a fundamental one, and a dispute was, in the opinion of the Colonial Office, sooner or later inevitable.        It would be better therefore to make a stand now than later on, in possibly loss-favourable conditions, when the French might, for instance, have established greater control over the American Group in the Turkish Petroleum Company. The dangers of a sorious difference with the French in the Sear East could be exaggerated.      The importance of securing the Haifa alignment at all costs was such that no card should be thrown away in pressing the question.10.     A reply was sent to this letter on February 25th,  explaining that the Foreign Office had never contemplated any abandonment of the policy of en-endeavouring to secure the Haifa Alignment.    The question at issue was purely one of the tactics which would be best calculated to secure the fulfilment of that policy.     As between His Majesty^ Government and the French Government, the question in dispute was ultimately whether the revised draft letter from the Turkish Petroleum Company to the Iraqi Government was to be retained or not.      Had that letter definitel secured the construction of the proposed railway along the Haifa alignment, the position might have heen different;      but the revised letter, whatever its advantages, did not  of Itself secure such
construction.        Were its retention insisted on, a long and difficult controversy would be inevitable; while, even if its retention were secured, the Company would still be at liberty to adopt another route, or to refrain from the construction of anv railway at all.      In the last resort,  the question of the alignment, and, indeed,  of the construction of the railway, must be decided by the Company itself. The attitude of the American group was therefore of vital importance;    and it seemed possible that,  if it eould be represented that the hands of the Turkish Petroleum Company had been forced in this matter by direct pressure from His MajestyTs Government, and a serious conflict were allowed to develop between the British and French Governments on the sole question of the retention of the revised draft letter, the American group would in all probability be committed to the adoption of the French thesis, and consequently to an attitude of determined opposition to the Anglo-Iraqi point of view. If no attempt were made to reach some compromise with the Prench Government, the result might we.il be,  in fact, that in order to retain a document which did not guarantee the Haifa alignment, the prospects of the Company agreeing to that alignment might be injured father than improvement ov e d.11.    In these circumstances the Foreign Office view was that the policy of His Majestyrs Government, and the desiderata of the Iraqi Government, were more likely to be furthered by methods of conciliation than by rigid Insistence on a line of action which
w   o   -it.had no guarantee of success;    and the earnest hope was expressed that the Colonial Office would now agree to His Majesty1s Ambassador in Paris being instructed to open informal conversations with M. 3erthelot with a view to arrive at some formula which would leave the Company free to carry on its negotiations but would prove satisfactory both to the British and French points of view.12.    As regards the French argument generally, it is.very difficult to  see. on what grounds we can, if pressed,  oppose the contention that the Iraqi Government and the Company are free to settle matters as they think best on an economic .ba.s;is Eor,  in view of the fact that the revised draft letter was never voluntarily accepted by the French directors, can we produce any convincing argument to refute the French contention that this draft was forced upon the Company by His Majesty1s Government,Eastern Department, Foreign Office.March 9th, 192 9,
