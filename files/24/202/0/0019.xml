II.-POSITION  IN  CHIEF  INDUSTRIES.COAL MINING.The coal mining position did not alter appreciably during the first two months of the quarter, but an increased seasonal demand for coal resulted in more full time being worked during December. The total coal mining unemployment figures fell from 280,000 at the end of October to 213,000 at the end of December.IRON AND STEEL.In the iron and steel trades additional employment was provided during December, unemployment falling by 5,000 during the month. A similar improve-ment on a smaller scale in pig-iron manufacture took place.SHIPBUILDING AND SHIP-REPAIRING.The shipbuilding position improved considerably during the month, a considerable number of new orders being booked and the unemployment figures falling from 67,000 at the end of October to 61,000 at the end of December. The amount of tonnage under construction at the end of December amounted to 1,242,794 tons as compared with 1,089,760 tons at the end of September.ENGINEERING.In most branches of the engineering industry little change took place during the quarter, although there was a slight improvement in marine and electrical engineering.TEXTILES.Cotton. During the first two months of the quarter the employment position of the cotton industry did not alter materially, but in December the usual increased activity prior to the holidays resulted in considerably more full-time working.   Temporary stoppages in December fell by about 7,000.Other Textiles. A similar improvement in the woollen and worsted industry took place towards the end of the year, whilst in most of the other textiles there was also increased activity.BUILDING.The usual seasonal slackness in building was in evidence during the quarter, unemployment increasing by almost 30,000 in the course of the three months.CLOTHING TRADES.Apart from some increased activity immediately before Christmas, employ -ment continued generally slack in the clothing trades.TRANSPORT, DOCK LABOUR AND SHIPPING SERVICES.Employment amongst dock labourers was slack at the beginning of the quarter, but improved a little towards the end. Amongst seamen, on the other hand, employment was somewhat worse during December than in the earlier two months.[18958]
III. WORK INSTITUTED FOR RELIEF OF UNEMPLOYMENT.Numbers Employed.[See note on page 1 of November 1924 Report (CP. 541 (24)).]The table which follows has been prepared to show, so far as information is available, the number of men employed on works instituted, with financial assistance from the Exchequer or the Road Fund, for the relief of unemployment.Scope of Table. The schemes included are those undertaken by Local and other Authorities and Public Companies with a financial contribution from the State with the object of relieving unemployment; and works in respect of which guarantees have been given under the Trade Facilities Acts as capital undertakings calculated to promote employment in this country. Schemes to which State financial assistance is given, but which are not undertaken primarily for the relief of unemployment (e.g., Housing Schemes), and works put in hand by Local Authorities without State assistance are not included. Certain other schemes involving Government assistance are also excluded in view of the impracticability of ascertaining the exact number of men who are directly provided with employment thereby; these include the Export Credits Scheme and contracts for equipment, clothing, &amp;c, accelerated by Government Contracting Departments.Method of Compilation. The figures for the Road and Bridge Schemes assisted by the Ministry of &apos; Transport and for schemes assisted by the Unemployment Grants Committee are (with the exception of certain road schemes in respect of which returns are received direct by the Ministry of Transport) obtained from returns received at Employment Exchanges from Local and other Authorities and Public Companies. Those relating to schemes assisted under the Trade Facilities Acts are compiled by the Trade Facilities Act Advisory Committee from returns received from Companies to whom guarantees under the Acts have been given.Works assisted by 	Number of Men employed at 				Dec. 29,1928.

The figures take no account of the employment provided indirectly, e.g., in the preparation and transport of materials, &amp;c.t These figures indicate men employed on the work itself. They include part only of the men employed on the manufacture of the materials used. They take no account of the labour involved in winning, transporting, &amp;c, raw materials.Note. No distinction is now made between the Forestry Commission^ normal and relief work, and grants for afforestation form part of the normal programme. The average number of forest employees engaged on the Commission^ operations (including Crown woods) during the quarter ended December 31, 1928, was 2,802 as compared with 2,870 for the corresponding quarter of 1927.
(Dominions Office.)Under the Empire Settlement Act, 1922 (an Act to make better provision for furthering British settlement in His Majesty&apos;s Oversea Dominions), various schemes have been agreed Avith Dominion Authorities. This Act, as its title implies, is not one of the Government measures designed to deal with unemployment, and should not be so regarded.For many years before and after the war, the natural increase of population exceeded the net migration movement by about 300,000 a year, but recently the gap between the natural increase and the net migration movement has tended to diminish. During 1927, the natural increase in England, Scotland and Wales was 201,178, and the net migration movement was 87,504. Consequently, the natural increase during the year, after deducting the net migration, was 113,674.The number of persons approved for assistance and the.number of departures during the months of October, November and December, 1928 (with the corresponding figures for the year 1927), and for the nine months ended the 31st December, 1928 and 1927, respectively, are set out in the following Table: Quarterly Progress Return relating to Schemes approved under &quot; The Empire Settlement Act, 1922.&quot;Approval and Departure Figures.

Expenditure by Poor Law Authorities, A (England and Wales), B (Scotland).These Statistical Tables have been compiled with a view to showing the extent of the effort from public sources since the Armistice to meet the problems of Post-War Resettlement and Unemployment, and to indicate the measure of assistance provided by the Exchequer. With regard to the latter, the methods of financial co-operation are so diverse that it is impracticable to give an aggregated figure of Exchequer Assistance. For this reason, the accompanying Summary is only indicative of the extent to which the Exchequer is involved, and must be regarded as supplementary to, and not in substitution of, the detailed information given in the Tables themselves.Summaky.(A.)Schemes..

The cost of the Overseas settlement free passage scheme for ex-Service men and women and their dependants (now terminated), which amounted to approximately  2,419,450, is not included in this table. Neither is the cost included of certain training of ex-Service men carried out in Ireland at a cost to the Imperial Exchequer of approximately  255,425.[18958]c
Table 2. Unemployment Insurance.(Estimates, Class V, Vote 9.)The National Insurance Act of 1911 provided insurance against unemployment in certain selected industries. It was followed by the Act of 191G, which increased the numbers of persons insured, and, in 1920, by an Act of general scope which applied compulsory insurance against unemployment to 12,000,000 persons. Subsequent amending Acts modified the conditions of receipt of benefit, increased contributions, provided benefit in respect of dependants, and authorised the Treasury to make advances out of the Consolidated Fund up to a limit of  40,000,000.By the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1927, the rates of benefit were revised from the 19th April, 1928, as follows : 17s. (instead of 18s.) a week for men, 15s. a week for women, with 7s. (instead of 5s.) a week for an adult dependant and 2s. a week for each young dependent child. As from July, 1928, reduced rates of benefit operated for persons under 21 years of age having no dependants ; contributions also were reduced for all persons under 21 years of age. Benefit may be paid for three months to a claimant who has paid 30 contributions in the two years preceding the date of his claim, and may continue throughout each subsequent period of three months at the beginning of which this condition is still satisfied. During a transitional period, which in individual cases may extend to April 1930, benefit may be paid to a claimant who does not satisfy the above condition, if he has paid 8 contributions in the two preceding years or 30 contributions at any time and fulfils certain other conditions.Statement of Income and Expenditure of the Unemployment Fund fromArmistice to December 29, 1928.Expenditure                    &amp;Benefit paid        ....         ....         .... 363,404,000Appropriation for Administration    .... 36,810,000Section 9 Unemployment Insurance Act (No. 2), 1924, and Section 25-Unemployment Insurance Act, 1920 2,960,000 Miscellaneous Refunds, &amp;o.....         ....         .... 1,959,000Interest (Net)       ...         ....         .... 1,915,000Income Contributions Employers          ....         .... .... 137,504,000Employed            ....         .... .... 123,169,000Exchequer           ....          .... .... 94,807,000Exchequer (for ex-Service Men) .... 4,297,000Balance of Old Fund at Armistice (excluding Interest accrued) * Employers           ....&apos;        .... .... 5,825,000Employed            .....         .... .... 5,825,000Exchequer           ....          .... .... 3,884,000407,048,000359,777,00015,534,000Loans from Treasury (Net)....          ....          .... 31,020,000Miscellaneous Deposits in respect of future  Contribu-tions, &amp;c.....          ............ 717,000407,048,000* The old Fund at November 8th, 1920, had reached a total of  22,210,000.

JC.) Ministry of Transport Schemes.Road and Bridge Programme, 1919-20. ; : To assist in the provision of employment for demobilised members of His Majesty&apos;s Forces until such time as they could be re-absorbed into industry, the Government after the Armistice inaugurated a special fund for the purpose of making grants on certain conditions to Highway Authorities for road work. The total of such grants has amounted to approximately  9,328,000 for Great Britain and it is estimated that the works carried out by Local Authorities in order to earn a grant aggregated in cost to approximately  20,000,000.Unemployment Works assisted out of the Road Fund. 1920-23 Programmes.The first &quot; Unemployment Programme &quot; proper was initiated by the Ministry of Transport in the Winter of 1920, and the following statement shows the total expenditure by the contributing parties to the end of 1927 and a forecast of expenditure during subsequent years, against the three programmes instituted prior to October 1923.Payments during Financial Year.

Land Settlement.In England and Wales the provision of small holdings under the Land Settle-ment (Facilities) Act, 1919, and other Land Settlement Schemes for the benefit primarily of ex-Service men, are carried out (a) through the agency of County Councils and Councils of County Boroughs and (&amp;) through the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries.Settlement through Local Authorities. The net capital cost of these schemes up to the 31st March, 1926, when the Land Settlement Scheme came to an end, is estimated to be  15,250,000, of which approximately  14,050,000 (net) was loaned by the Public Works Loan Board. Interest in respect of such loans is payable by Councils. Under Section 26 of the Land Settlement (Facilities) Act, 1919, the Exchequer bore the loss incurred up to the 31st March, 1926, on the Councils&apos; Small Holdings account (e.g., due to charging a fair as opposed to an economic rent), so far as such loss had been reasonably and necessarily incurred.As from the 1st April, 1926, the Exchequer assistance takes the form of annual contributions to meet the difference between the loan charges and the estimated net income from the Councils&apos; estates. These contributions which did not commence until the year 1927, will vary from year to year, and their total capitalized value cannot at present be estimated.In Scotland land settlement is not conducted through the agency of County Councils.Ministry&apos;s Settlements. Since 1916 a number of properties have been acquired, and the capital expenditure thereon and the difference, if any, between the annual cost of maintaining and administering them and the rents received from Small Holders is being borne by the Exchequer. Some of these properties have been disposed of and the net expenditure on the remainder does not involve an appreciable cash call upon the Exchequer, as additional capital expenditure is met from the surplus cash revenue or from proceeds of sale of property.Land Settlement.(A.)

Juveniles.Shortly after the Armistice and throughout 1919, Juvenile Unemployment Centres were opened in certain localities to provide instruction for unemployed juveniles with a view to preventing deterioration. Centres were few in number from 1920 to 1922, but were re-established on an extended scale during 1923. The present scheme of grants is, to some extent, an emergency measure pending consideration by the National Advisory Councils for Juvenile Employment of the recommendations of the Malcolm, Salvesen and Blanesburgh Committees. In certain cases 75 per cent, grants and in others 100 per cent, per capita grants are payable, while in the case of certain mining areas payment of 100 per cent, approved out-of-pocket expenditure has been sanctioned.Statement A jelow shows the average attendance since the 1st April, 1923, the number of Centres and the number of Authorities to whom grants have been paid (with the percentages payable).

Up to the 31st July, 1924, the cost of this scheme was met partly from Exchequer Grants and party from other sources, but, as from the 1st August, 1924, the whole cost has been borne by the Exchequer. Additional provision has been made in the vote for 1928 for training women and girls in distressed mining areas with a view to their migration to other Districts.
