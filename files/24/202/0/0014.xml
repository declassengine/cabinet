IhI3 DQCuKSM-I 13 THS PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT,echbt.!.P.65(29).COPY KO.      &amp;CABINET IRISH IMMIGRATION.SUPPLEMENTARY MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OP STATEPOR SCOTLAND.In my Memorandum of the 21st Pebruary, 1929, on the subject of Irish Immigration,  I stated that In view of certain facts, which I mentioned,  I should not be prepared without further discussion to agree with the conclusions drawn in the first paragraph of the Home Secretary&apos;s Memorandum of the 20th -February:    those conclusions were to the effect that the mischief had already been done and that the immigration of natives of the Irish Pree State to Scotland is not now such as to affect materially the position created by the presence in Scotland of a large body of persons of Irish extraction.Since then my attention has been drawn to information, as shown in the statement appended hereto, which has been obtained informally from the Ministry of Labour Office in Edinburgh and gone over by the Ministry of Labour in London, as to the number of Irish employed on the Lochaber Water Scheme.It will be seen that of a total of 2,200 employed on this scheme in November, 1928,  225 had transferred themselves to insured employment in Scotland from Ireland since January of that year, and no fewer than 775 had come from Ireland to take up insurable employment in this country for the first time, during the same period.I desire also to bring to the notice of ray colleagues the fact that, according to information received from His Majesty&apos;s -Ambassador at Washington, there is a distinct possibility that, owing to the Senate of the United States deciding no longer to postpone the operation of the national origins provisions cf the Immigration Act of 1924,  the quota for Irish Free State immigrants into the United States will be greatly reduced as from the 1st July next, and that for immigrants from Great Britain and Northern Ireland greatly increased.JOHN GILMOUR.Scottish Office, S.W.I.4th March, 1929.J
