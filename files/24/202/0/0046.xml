(TKJff J30CUMENT  IS TH&apos;.-   PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY^ GOVERNMENT) .S ECRU. C.P. 96  (29).COPY NO.CABINTREDUCTION AND LIMITATION OF ARMAMENTS.POLICY IN REGARD TO THE NEXT  ^ESTIw    - COMMISSION.BsSST IiviG OK THE PRE HARA&apos;i ORYDraft Telegram to Sir Esme Howard (Washington).(Circulated by direction of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs).    &quot;Foreign Office.March,  1929.I should be glad If Your Excellency would make a verbal communication In the following sense either to Mr. Kellogg or Mr. Castle.His Majesty&apos;s Government have lately reviewed the instructions to their Delegate on the Preparatory Committee for the Disarmament Conference, which meets at Geneva on April 15.It seems to be generally understood that It will probably be Impossible at this stage to make progress with naval disarmament problem and Indeed In present circumstances it is not likely that discussion In full Committee or even in a special naval Sub-Committee at Geneva would be fruitful of result.His Majesty&apos;s Government propose to take the line that difficulty of proceeding with naval problem. Is no reason for doing nothing in regard to disarmament on land and in the air. Principal naval Powers, bound by Washington Treaty, have already accepted very large measure of limitation,  and even of reduction:   nothing has been done In regard to armies or air forces.      It is most desirable that progress should be made
in those spheres and H.M.G. have revised their instructions so as to enable their Delegate to co-operate In the most helpful manner possible.H.M.Go fear, however, that it is necessary to contemplate the possibility that, along the present lines of discussion, no agreement may be reached,  and they have been considering whether, In the event of a breakdown, any more promising alternative course could be proposed.The Convention which the Committee have for two years been trying to elaborate Is not very ambitiousB      It would in practice amount only to an agreement by the signatories not to exceed certain limits which would be faxed by each for themselves.      In fact each signatory would be binding itself to a certain programme for a given period     Only the Committee have been unable to agree on the headings or framework of the programmes,,      And while discussion continues,  no sort of real progress is being made towards practical limitation of armaments. If, therefore,  It becomes clear that the Committee can make no real progress on present lines, H.M.G. contemplate suggesting that?  if agreement cannot be reached on the exact form, as it were,  of the programmes, rather than do nothing,  each Government should be asked to submit a programme, in its own form, covering a period of years, in the hope that the programmes might eventually be assembled and embodied in a convention binding the signatories not to exceed them.As the U.S. Government are aware, the French and other continental Governments attach great importance to their theory that all three arms must be treated alike, and therefore any proporal for programmes such as that outlined above would have to apply to the navy as well as the army and air force.     For their part, they are disposed to hope that such a procedure., even applied to naval armamftnts, might render possible the
realisation of some, if not all, of the results which the naval Powers have been seeking to obtain.      But before making any such proposal, H.M.G. arc anxious to know whether the U.S. Government consider that it would be embarrassing, or whether they see In it any possibility of useful result.For the moment E.M.G. are making no mention of this idea in any quarter and wish only to obtain the confidential view of the U.S. Government, as a preliminary step. H.M.G. are anxious to avoid giving any impression that they despair of the success of the Preparatory Committee on present lines, and to avoid prejudicing in any way its chancea. and for that reason they trtZ3-&amp; that the U.S, Government . -win regard this communication as entirely confidential.     The proposal outlined above would only be made If discussion on present lines definitely fails.      In that event British Delegate would explain proposals to members before they disperse and beg them to obtain the views of their Governments thereon at the earliest opportunity.A.C.March 22nd,  1929.
