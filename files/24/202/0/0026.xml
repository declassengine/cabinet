It is Invariably taxed in the JMavy when received continuously for more than three months in one and the same appointment.    Servants Allowance is invariably taxed in the Navy and. never in the Army or Royal Air Force,In 1922,  the Admiralty desired to take the advice of the Law Officers upon the legality of the existingprocedure, and, accordingly, after consultation with theTreasury,  a draft case was prepared by the Inland RevenueDepartment in conjunction with the  Admiralty, War Officeand Air Ministry for the consideration of the Law Officers.In this case the Inland Revenue stated the general -positionas follows i-&quot;As will be seen from the papers which accompany the practice as to taxing these allowances is by no means uniform, allowances similar in nature being treated differently in different Services.    It is desired that the legal position should be ascertained and the practice made uniform in accordance therewith7&apos;.
2 -[Admiralty, S.V/.1.12th March,  1929.W. C. 33.&quot;It is not the desire of the Departments of the Sighting Services to suggest proposals which would give preferential treatment to the personnel of the Royal Navy, Army and Royal Air X^orce, their sole aim in this matter &quot;being to overoome the adrainistrative difficulties and grave anomalies whereby individuals serving in the smallest fighting unit are receiving different treatment in the matter of taxation.    They desire to point out that it is essential that there shou.ld be no differentia-tion of treatment of personnel of the Services which must he treated in this respect as one complete body,roIt will he seen from the foregoing that the existence of inequalities and anomalies in the taxation of the Mghting 3?orces is not in dispute.    Owing, however,  to the intervention of the treasury the case has not been submitted to the Law Officers.     A copy of the correspondence beti^een the Chancellor of the Exohequer and myself on the subject is appended to this Memorandum,  from which it will he seentthat the Admiralty is prepared either to let the case go to the Law Officers of the Grown with a view to equal and just treatment of all concerned, or alternatively, in deference to the views of the Treasury, to drop the case for the Law Officers on the imderstanding that treatment comparable with that accorded to officers and men of the other Sighting forces is accorded to officers and men of the Royal Navy in the matter of taxation of the compensatory allowances - i.e. Lodging Money and Servants Allowance.    Owing to the small number of officers and men of the Royal Navy and Royal Marines employed ashore, the latter concession would entail a sacrifice of revenue of less than  13,000 a year, while no increase in expenditure would result in either the Navy, Army or Air i?orce Estimates.I desire to point out in conclusion that the favoured position of officers of the Army and Royal Air 5&apos;orce has been the subject of repeated representations by CoEBnanders*-in-Chief and others, to which- consideration has been promised, and that the Board of Admiralty cannot aoquiesce in the continuance of the status quo.
&quot;AP;?2HDIX   TO    C,?. 76/29&quot;.Tr e a stiry Chambe r s, WHITEHALL,   S    .26th January,  1928.My dear iPirst Lord,I enclose a note on the question of the liability to Income Tax of Cash Allowances received &quot;by naval and military officers.?  X very much hope that you will feel able to agree with, the suggestion that in the circumstances the best course is to leave matters as they are..Yours very sincerely,(Sgd* )   Winston S. Churchill.Jot many years past there have been certain divergencies in practice in the treatment for Income -Tax purposes of the various cash allowances received by the members of the three lighting Services, under which Naval Officers have received less favourable treatment than Officers in the Army and Mr .t?oree *Someyyears ago when Sir Ro Home was Chancellor of the Exchequer the matter was brought to his notice at the instigation of the Admiralty and he then approved a suggestion, which came in the first instance from&apos; that Department, that the three Service Departments and the Inland Revenue should collaborate and submit a joint case to the Lav/ Officers of the Crown for their opinion, with a view to securing uniformity of treatment throughout the Departments in the matter of the taxation of allowanceSeThat case is now nearing completion, but it is a matter for consideration whether if should go forward since the effect of the Law Officers1  opinion may well be to bring into charge to Income Tax allowances which have not hitherto been charged.    The effect of this would bo to cause a good deal of irritation amongst those affected, for a very small financial return.    So far as can be seen all that Naval Officers could hope to gain from the opinion of the Lav/ Officers is whatever satisfaction they could derive from the taxation of Officers in the other two Services on precisely the same basis as themselves.    It can bo assumed that the Naval Officer would not secure any material benefit for himself and that the removal of the existing anomalies might well result in a general settlement less advantageous to the Officers of the three Services than is the existing practice-.In these circumstances the question arises whether the Admiralty are prepared to let the present position remain ralchallenged.    They have strongly criticised it in the past, and if they continue to press the matter, the publicity thus given to it will very likely arouse the activity of the Public Accounts Committee.
- 2 -ADMIRALTY,  S.W.I.24th March,&apos;1928,My dear Chancellor of the Exchequer,In reply to your letter of the 26th January last, enclosing a note on the question of the liability to Income ;ffax of cash allowances received by Naval and Military Officers,  I regret that I am unable to acquiesce in your suggestion that the best course is to leave natters as they area the illegality of the present practice of the Army and Air Force is not in dispute.    It is alluded to in the Second Report of the Public Accounts Committee 1911, when the Committee condemned the practice of exempting funds from assessment without statutory authority and expressed the opinion that the matter should be rectified on the occasion of any general revision of rates of pay.     This view was also endorsed by the Treasury who, in their minute upon the report referred to, acquiesced in the continuance for the time being of then existing arrangements only in order to avoid raising the whole question of the revision of allowances in the Army at that date and agreed that the matter should be put on a proper footing whenever a general revision of allowances took placeoIt is not the desire of the Naval Officer to deprive Officers of the Army and Air Force of any privileges which they may now enjoy in the matter of taxation, but we find it impossible,  from the administrative standpoint, to defend against Parliamentary, criticism and criticism &quot;by serving-Officers a system of taxation under which an allowance in lieu of servants is always taxed, when paid to an Officer of the Royal Navy or Royal Marines and never taxed when paid . to an Officer of either of the sister Services; and under tfhioh lodging Allowance is taxed whenever paid for more than three months in an appointment to an Officer of the Royal Navy or Royal Marines and taxed only in a small percentage of cases when paid,  for however long a period to an Officer of the Army or Air Force.There are many other minor anomalies in connection with the taxation or exemption of Naval, Military and Air JPrce allowances, which it would be desirable to remove by an authoritative ruling, but I should be prepared in deference to your view to drop the idea of consulting the Law Officers, provided that the major grievances explained in the preceding paragraph are rectified by giving the personnel of the Royal Navy and Royal Marines privileges corresponding to those enjoyed by officers and men of the sister Services-    As the total amount of Income Tax charged on Lodging Allowance and Servants Allowance in the Royal Navy and Royal Marines is less than  13,000 per annum, it is clear that this concession to equity can be arranged without serious loss to the Exchequer.Yours very sincerely, (Sgd.)    Vf. C. Bridgeman.The EtcHonaWinston S. Churchill,  C.H., M.5
