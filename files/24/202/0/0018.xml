9 9 report.INTRODUCTION.1. AT a Meeting of the Cabinet held on the 29th February, 1928 (Cabinet 12 (28), Conclusion 3), the Prime Minister stated that circumstances rendered it desirable to investigate further the question of the Baghdad-Haifa Railway, and informed his colleagues that he proposed to refer it to a Cabinet Committee under his Chairmanship. This Cabinet Committee met on the 7th March, 1928, and after hearing evidence from Sir John Cadman and Sir Robert Waley Cohen on behalf of the Anglo-Persian Oil and the Turkish Petroleum Companies and from Sir Albert Stern and Mr. F. C. Tiarks (representing the promoters of a scheme to build the Baghdad-Haifa Railway) decided to appoint a Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence, composed of representatives of the Treasury, Foreign Office, Colonial Office, Admiralty and Board of Trade to continue the investigation.2. By direction of the Prime Minister the Sub-Committee was accordingly constituted as follows The Right Hon. Earl Stanhope, D.S.O., M.C., Civil Lord, Admiralty (in the Chair),Sir John Shuckburgh, K.C.M.G., C.B., Assistant Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies,Mr. G. C. Upcott, C.B., Deputy Controller of Supply Services, Treasury, Mr. H. J. Seymour, C.M.G., First Secretary, Foreign Office, Air Commodore C. L. N. Newall, C.M.G., C.B.E., Deputy Chief of the Air Staff.Mr. J. J. Wills. Director of Petroleum Department. Board of Trade,the terms of reference being to continue the investigation into the question of giving Government support, and if so, in what form, to the construction of the proposed Baghdad-Haifa Railway and/or pipe-line.3. The Sub-Committee, after reviewing the question in the light of the latest available information and conferring with Sir Albert Stern and Mr. Tiarks, submit the following report: REVIEW OF SITUATION.Prospects of Oil Production in Iraq.4. At the meeting on the 7th March of the Cabinet Committee emphasis was laid on the importance of determining the prospects of the production of large quantities of oil in Iraq before any decision, involving Government support of the railway scheme, is taken.5. We attach a Report, dated the 28th March, 1928, on this subject ipyj Sir John Cadman (Appendix I), from which it appears that, in the view of the Oil Companies, the prospects of very large production of oil in Iraq in the future are extremely promising. Oil has * been struck at three definite localities (Jabal Qaiyarah, Baba Gurgur and Naft Khana); the two former are situated in the Turkish Petroleum Company&apos;s area and the third in the &quot; Transferred Territory &quot; of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company.6.   Paragraph 13 of the Report summarises the present position as follows : &quot; The present phase is notable equally by reason of the definitive evidence obtained and of the immense range of further information revealed as being essential to any attempt at a final delimitation of the oil-bearing fields of Iraq. To sum up what has been definitely achieved : Neither at Baba Gurgur nor Qaiyarah is the producing well to be regarded as emblematic of freak conditions, and it is thought safe to say that substantial production (as distinct from the potentiality of enormous production) could be relied upon from each additional well drilled in the vicinity of the existing wells.To strike oil in such quantities as obtained at Baba Gurgur, and that within a limited period of months from the inception of the geological [17756] b 2
survey, must be regarded as -an event of quite unexampled good fortune; and one which, in conjunction with the other results obtained, furnishes a complete vindication of the expenditure to date and of the operative methods adopted.Despite, therefore, the necessarily rudimentary nature of exploratory operations, the existence of oil in substantial commercial quantities has been definitely established, and there has been opened up the promise of one field, or possibly several fields, of great richness.&quot;7. In conclusion, the Report insists on the necessity for further systematic investigation by drilling to establish the marginal limits of the various fields, and states that, without the data so afforded, any speculation as to the nature and volume of the reserves must be in terms both general and tentative. &quot; When the data is obtained, a real computation of reserves can be confidently approached. Pending such evidence, any decision to construct a pipe-line must be regarded as premature, although many pipe-lines have been built on slighter evidence than that which Iraq now affords.&quot;8. It may be noted that the Cabinet Committee were assured by both Sir John Cadman and Sir R. Waley Cohen that the Iraq field had been far more completely proved than had the Anglo-Persian Oil Company&apos;s fields at the time when the Government decided to invest in that Company.9. In a recent telegram (the 28th April, 1928) Sir H. Dobbs has stated that &quot; The new gushers just opened out simultaneously by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company in the neighbourhood of Ahwaz and in the transferred territories near Khanakin are bound to attract much attention, and I believe that they have convinced experts that oil can be got anywhere in the neighbourhood of the Persian Iraq frontiers.&quot;10. We doubt whether any useful purpose would be served by attempting to obtain further reports from disinterested sources. For the British Government to send an Expert Mission to Iraq to investigate the question on the spot, would, in our view, be open to such grave political objections as to be impracticable; moreover, even if practicable, the cost of such an investigation would be very heavy. Any enquiry at home would necessarily have to be based on information and data supplied by the Oil Companies.11. After careful consideration, we think that the prospects of the future production of large quantities of oil in Iraq are sufficiently assured to justify the British Government in endeavouring to secure the Baghdad-Haifa alignment for the pipe-lines.The Disposal of the Iraq Oil Output.12. Sir John Cadman considers that it will take at least two years of test drilling before the limits of the Turkish Petroleum Company&apos;s field can be determined and the work for production undertaken. It is probable, however, in his view, that within 18 months the,*prospects will be sufficiently known for the construction of the first pipe-line to be started.13. This pipe-line will certainly go to some port on the coast of Palestine or Syria, and, as the production of oil in Iraq increases, it will doubtless be found necessary to lay further pipe-lines on the same alignment. Sir John Cadman has stated that the, Anglo-Persian Oil Company will certainly use the pipe-line in respect of their production in the &quot; Transferred Territories &quot; and in adjacent Persian areas, and has indicated that if the latter Company decided to construct an independent trans-desert pipe-line, it is probable that that line would go to Haifa, and that this might influence the Turkish Petroleum Company to adopt the same alignment if its pipe-line had not already been laid. It has also been suggested that if a Baghdad-Mediterranean pipe-line was built, the Anglo-Persian Oil Company might find it economical, in view of their present yearly expenditure in Canal dues alone ot  880,000 for the transport of oil by the Suez, route, to construct a pipe-line from their South Persian fields to Baghdad to connect up with the Baghdad-Mediterranean line.
The Present Position of the Oil Companies Operating in Iraq.14. The question of the provision of railway facilities between Iraq and the Mediterranean is one of vital concern to the Companies engaged in developing the Iraq Oil Fields. The present position as regards the Companies is briefly summarised in the following paragraphs : The Anglo-Persian Oil Company.15. The Anglo-Persian Oil Company have the exclusive right to explore for oil in the two &quot; Transferred Territories &quot; situated north-east of Baghdad on the Iraq side of the Iraq-Persian frontier. The Company are also prospecting for oil in the adjacent Persian districts. The Company have found oil in large quantities at Naft Khana and near Khanakin in these territories, and a refinery has been established near the latter place. Khanakin is connected by rail with Baghdad, but no pipe-line (other than the short line to the local refinery) has yet been laid and no oil for export is as yet being produced from the &quot; Transferred Territories &quot; or adjacent Persian areas.The Turkish Petroleum. Company.16. The Turkish Petroleum Company is a British Company, the capital of which is at present divided between 17. Negotiations for the introduction of American participation are on the point of completion. Under the contemplated arrangements the Company will be re-organised and the capital redistributed between The American Group will thus receive 50 per cent, of the Anglo-Persian Group&apos;s holding, and in return the Anglo-Persian are to be entitled to receive 10 per cent, of the Turkish Petroleum Company&apos;s oil output free. It is not clear whether legis-lation will be necessary, but the Anglo-Persian Oil Company are examining the question.   -18. By a Convention signed on the 14th March, 1925, the Iraq Government granted the Turkish Petroleum Company the exclusive right to explore for petroleum and allied substances in the Vilayets of Baghdad and Mosul, excluding the &quot; Transferred Territories,&quot; for a period of 75 years. Among other provisions, the Convention (as subsequently modified by the parties) stipulated that the Company should before the 14th November, 1928, select 24 plots each of an area of 8 square miles and construct a pipeline to a port for export shipment as soon as that course should be commercially justifiable.19. The Iraq Government are to receive a royalty at the rate of 4 / - a ton until 20 years after the completion of the pipeline and subsequently at an adjusted rate.20. Since the date of the Convention the Company have been proving their area, which is served by two existing railways, that from Baghdad to Kalaat-Shergat on the Tigris and that from Baghdad to Kirkuk. No pipelines have as yet been laid and no oil is as yet being produced for export.Anglo-Persian GroupRoyal Dutch-Shell Group ...French GroupM.

The British Oil Development Syndicate.21. Some months ago the Turkish Petroleum Company requested the Iraq Government to grant them a five years&apos; extension of the time limit within which they must select their 24 plots for development. Sir H. Dobbs was instructed to support this application, the grant of which was definitely promised by the Iraq Government subject to approval by the Iraq Parliament. At this stage the British Oil Development Syndicate (including Andrew Weir and Co., Sir E. &apos;Manville and Admiral Lord Wester-Wemyss) made an offer to King Feisal to construct the Baghdad-Haifa railway without any financial contribution or guarantee of interest or profits from Iraq as part of an arrangement by which they were to obtain oil and other concessions. It is, however, understood that the Syndicate will expect assistance in some form from the British Government. Until the formal proposals of the Syndicate have been received and examined no useful purpose would be served by commenting upon them, but it may be noted that, apart from other considerations, the Convention between the Iraq Government and the Turkish Petroleum Company grants to that Company an exclusive concession (subject to the provisions of Article 6 referred to below) for the whole of Iraq outside the &quot;Transferred Territories &quot; (where the Anglo-Persian already held an exclusive concession) and the vilayet of Basra (where the prospects of finding oil are understood to be small). The Company have up to the 14th November, 1928, to select for development 24 rectangular plots of 8 square miles each. Under Article 6 of the Convention the Iraq Government must, not later than the 14th March, 1930, and annually thereafter, select not less than 24 rectangular plots of 8 square miles each, and offer the same for competition, by sealed tender, to all responsible corporations, firms and individuals, without distinction of nationality, who desire leases, the sale proceeds of the competition going to the Company (in view of their rights over the whole of the territory covered by the Convention). It is clear, therefore, that, unless the Turkish Petroleum Company waive their rights under the Convention, there is no method by which the British Oil Development Syndicate can obtain an oil concession except by bidding at an auction.In the event of the Turkish Petroleum Company so waiving their rights, the question would arise whether any arrangement which might be contemplated with the British Oil Development Syndicate was in accordance with the obligations assumed by the british and Iraq Governments under the non-discrimination clause (Article XT) of the&apos; Treaty of 1922.22. The Company are entitled to receive the proceeds of sale of the plots put up to auction. Although there is no provision in terms precluding the Company from bidding for these plots, we are advised that it might be difficult legally to main-tain a claim on the part of the Company to participate in the competition. There is no specific provision which would debar the Company from tendering for the plots through the medium of subsidiary groups. It might thus be held that they are in a position to prevent leases being granted to anyone but themselves, since they could always outbid, either directly or indirectly, any competitor without financial detriment. The groups represented in the Turkish Petroleum Company might, alternatively, agree beforehand not to tender against each other for particular plots so as to enable each group to bid for the plots which it wishes to acquire.23. The Iraq Government have the right under Article 6 &quot;on reasonable grounds &quot; to reject the highest tender, and, in the event of a dispute as to what con-stituted &quot; reasonable grounds,&quot; they would be entitled to take the matter to arbitra-tion under Article 40 of the Convention. It might, however, be difficult for the Iraq Government to establish that they were acting reasonably in disapproving of the highest bidder merely because it was a company in which the Turkish Petroleum Company was financially interested, or was a company which had a financial interest in that company or was a subsidiary of such a company.24. Lord Wester-Wemyss, who has been conferring in Baghdad on behalf of the Syndicate with the Iraq Government, has now returned to London, and may approach the Turkish Petroleum Company in the hope of reaching some amicable arrangement with that Company. We have been informed, however, by Sir John Cadman that there is no prospect whatever of the Turkish Petroleum Company consenting to enter into any arrangement of any kind with the Syndicate, that the Company resent in the strongest possible manner the Syndicated intervention and
will resist to the utmost any attempt by the Syndicate to obtain oil concessions in Iraq, that there is no evidence that the Syndicate are in a financial position to undertake such costly ventures as the development and marketing of oil and the construction of railways and pipelines, and in short, that, in his opinion, the activities of the Syndicate are directed not to the financial development of the Iraq oil-fields, but to creating a favourable situation for Stock Exchange speculation. At a meeting held on the 5th June, 1928, at which representatives of the American interests were present, these views are understood to have been adopted by the Turkish Petroleum Company.25. While it thus seems improbable that any arrangement will be reached between the Turkish Petroleum Company and the Syndicate we consider (1) that the Iraq Government are unlikely to take a final decision on the Company&apos;s application for a five years&apos; extension until negotiations have broken down and the Syndicate have definitely withdrawn their proposals, (2) that the Turkish Petroleum Company will not make any move as regards pipeline construction until they know whether their application for extension of time is to be granted and until they have considered the reports of their survey missions, and (3) that it may be safely assumed that the Turkish Petroleum Company will endeavour to defer a decision for as long as possible and that it is probable that pipeline construction will not in any event be started within the next 18 months.Decisions affecting the Route of the Pipeline.26. When the Turkish Petroleum Company decide to proceed with the con-struction of the Iraq-Mediterranean pipelines it may, however, be taken for granted that, having selected places at which they are assured that the terminal facilities are in all respects adequate to deal with the pipeline output, the two considerations of paramount importance which are bound to influence their decision as to alignment will be those of security and cost.26a. With regard to security, the Company are bound to satisfy themselves that their pipeline service will not be subjected to interference or interruption in any form. The successful marketing of oil depends on the ability of the producer to implement his contracts with certainty. The Company will, therefore, have to assure themselves that their pipeline services will be secure not only from actual hostile attack, but from any kind of interference by the local Governments or disorganisation resulting from local unrest.27. With regard to cost, we have been informed that in the absence of rail facilities the cost of an initial (double) pipeline from Iraq to a Mediterranean port is estimated at between  10 and  12 million, of which  2 million would have to be spent in the purchase and maintenance of motor transport service. If the pipeline could be laid alongside an existing railway a saving of 20 per cent, of the cost would result. Great economies would also be realised in the laying of subsequent pipelines, in their maintenance and in the initial construction and subsequent maintenance of the pumping stations.28. Experts in the employment of the Turkish Petroleum Company have been engaged on a survey of alternative routes of a pipeline and of the best port for the pipeline terminal.   The results of these enquiries are not yet known.Use of certain Middle Eastern Ports in War by British Tankers.29. In view of the vital importance of securing oil fuel supplies for the Navy, we set out briefly the position as to the use of certain middle eastern ports by British tankers in time of war,30. Haifa.-Great Britain would be entitled to use Haifa at all times under Article 17 of the Palestine Mandate.31. Syrian Ports. Tripoli, Beirut, Alexandretta. According to the ordinary rules of International Law (especially Hague Convention 13, Article 5), the obligations of neutrality would require France (if a friendly neutral) to see that Syrian ports were not used as a base of naval operations, and this might well be regarded as obliging her to see that any oil fuel taken on board at Syrian ports in
time of war was delivered to a shore base and not direct to the Fleet or to a warship; further, that the tanker was not one which was also employed in delivery of oil to the Fleet. Such restrictions would be a serious inconvenience but no more. In the past France has been lax in such matters.32. If, however, France was ill-disposed or under enemy pressure, she might impose a complete embargo on the shipment of oil fuel without giving reasons. If an excuse was needed she could argue, for example, that Malta being exclusively a fleet base near Syria, supply of oil fuel from Syria to naval tanks at Malta really meant that the Mediterranean fleet was being based on Syrian Ports.33. It would therefore seem that if the pipeline was taken to a Syrian port Great Britain would be placing herself at the mercy of the French as regards this source of supply.34. Abadan. It has hitherto been thought that, although Persia is gradually acquiring a more independent status than she had during the late war, it would probably be a long time before Great Britain need expect any difficulties as regards oil fuel supply from Abadan. It is now, however, agreed that, as regards the future, this view is too optimistic, and should not be accepted without qualification. This latter opinion has been strengthened by recent occurrences at Abadan.Possible Alternative Pipeline Routes.35. Assuming that pipelines will hereafter be laid between Iraq and the Mediterranean, the ports to which they might be brought are Alexandretta, Tripoli, Beirut and Haifa. For the purpose of considering possible alignments of the pipe-lines, Tripoli and Beirut may be regarded as alternative terminals of one route. There are therefore three possible pipeline routes :  (1.) Kirkuk-Alexandretta terminating at Alexandretta.(2.) Kirkuk-Tripoli-Beiru,t terminating at either Tripoli or Beirut.(3.) Baghdad-Haifa terminating at Haifa.The Kirkuk-Alexandretta Route.36. This route is 564 miles in length, its steepest gradient being 3,000 feet in 15 miles. The pipelines would have to cross the Amanus Range over difficult country deep in snow in winter. The alignment would traverse Iraq, Turkish and Syrian territory and would pass through areas where disturbances are liable to occur. The contemplated alignment follows the existing railway for 225 miles, but the railway needs the completion of 110 miles from Nisibin to Mosul and 50 miles from Mosul to Kalaat Shergat, the terminal of the standard gauge from Baghdad a total distance of 160 miles.37. A service of four trains a week each way is in operation over the Aleppo-Mardin (Nisibin) section. Efforts are being made by the International Sleeping Car Company to obtain the necessary powers to complete the railway so as to give through communication from Constantinople (or Egypt) to Baghdad by connecting up the Aleppo-Nisibin line with the (standard gauge) Kalaat Shergat-Baghdad line. It should be noted that the Iraq Government attach great importance to the extension of the existing Baghdad-Kirkuk line from Kirkuk to Mosul. Such an extension would mean that, apart from the gap of about 110 miles from Nisibin to Mosul, there would be rail facilities between Baghdad and Alexandretta.38. We think that any decision respecting the Baghdad-Haifa railway should be based on the assumption that the Aleppo-Nisibin-Mosul-Baghdad railway will eventually be completed. In this connection it may be noted that in the view of the promoters of the Baghdad-Haifa railway scheme the completion of the Aleppo-Baghdad railway would seriously prejudice the chances of conducting the former railway on an economic basis.39. Alexandretta Harbour. Alexandretta is capable of being developed into a good harbour for tankers, but the expense would be heavy and the town is onh
five miles from the Turkish frontier. A proposal has been made to build a big breakwater and five docks. The Harbour Commission is German, but at present the control is vested in a Trench Company. A small harbour for lighters and tugs has been recently built at the expense of the Syrian Government.Kirkuk-Tripoli Route.40. The alignment from Kirkuk to Tripoli measures 555 miles, and if extended to Beirut, about 600 miles, the steepest gradient being 1,500 feet in 55 miles. The line crosses Iraq and Syrian territories, the latter often disturbed. On this route 60 miles (from Tripoli to Horns) is at present served by an existing railway. The French are proposing to complete the Tripoli-Beirut extension, and if this is done, rail facilities for pipeline construction would be available from Beirut to Horns about 110 miles. For 160 miles water is unknown, but this difficulty might possibly be obviated by artesian well boring. No proposal has so far been made to construct a railway from Tripoli to Iraq, but the route would apparently be an easy one.41. Tripoli Harbour. A harbour of rectangular shape could be constructed immediately south of Mina. The seaward mole would be more expensive to build than that at Haifa on account of the depth of water (9 fathoms instead of 6 fathoms), but it would provide double the harbour space to that at Haifa for a given amount of breakwater. Tripoli also has the advantage of requiring a minimum amount of reclamation, there being deep water close inshore, while at Haifa considerable reclamation would be necessary.42. Beirut Harbour. A breakwater harbour with coaling berths alongside already exists and with a small expenditure 2,400 feet of wharfage could be completed. By the extension of the present breakwater (1,530 yards of mole in 9-10 fathoms) a large and absolutely sheltered harbour could be built. Further reclamation of the foreshore Avould give an area 1,400 yards by an average of 100 yards for the construction of oil-pumping plant, &amp;c.Baghdad-Haifa Roiite.43. The alignment measures 650 miles the steepest gradient being 2,700 feet in 250 miles and syphoning 1,000 feet in the Jordan Valley. The route traverses peaceful country in Iraq and Palestine. At present known water points are too far apart for satisfactory steam working, but water may be found by boring. A photographic survey of the  erka valley section of the route has been carried out by the Air Force in conjunction with the Survey Department of the Palestine Government.44. Haifa Harbour. The work of constructing&apos; a harbour will start at the end of this year. The total cost is estimated at approximately  1,000,000, and will be met out of the Palestine Guaranteed Loan. The harbour provides for 7 moored berths and two oiling berths alongside. The breakwaters will be 1 mile, 1,300 yards in length.Summary regarding Routes.45. The relative advantages and drawbacks of the three routes discussed above may be summarised as follows : 46. The Alexandretta-Kirkuk route has the great advantage of an existing railway which only needs to be completed for about 160 miles. On the other hand, it is the least satisfactory route from the standpoint of security as it follows the Turkish-Syrian frontier. The route is, moreover, open to topographical objection inasmuch as it involves a rise of 3,000 feet in 15 miles. We are, however, informed that rises or falls in the pipeline present no insuperable difficulties from the point of view of pumping the oil.47. The Kirkuk-Tripoli-Beirut alignment has the advantage of being probably the shortest and easiest route. Compared with the Baghdad-Haifa line there would be a saving that might amount to a sum of  2- 3 millions in the cost of the initial pipeline and a reduction in annual maintenance and pumping[17756] c
charges. On the other hand, it is arguable that this route might be less attractive to the oil interests than the Haifa route from the point of view of security and the present terminal facilities. With regard to security it should, however, be noted that up to the present the French have had no difficulty in safeguarding their railway from Tripoli to Horns; on the other hand, the Nairn cross-desert motor service has from time to time encountered difficulties in the Syrian desert section of its route The very presence of the oil pipeline on any route will tend to more settled conditions as it provides those living in the vicinity of the pipeline with work, remunerative wages and subsidies to the ruling sheikhs.48. The Baghdad-Haifa route is probably on the whole the most secure; it also has the assured prospect of satisfactory harbour facilities at Haifa and of the whole alignment being within territory under British influence and protection. Against these advantages must be put the far heavier cost of pipeline provision and maintenance due to the longer distance.49. As regards possible harbours, were it not for the fact that construction is about to commence at Haifa, the desirability of the harbours would appear to be in the sequence Beirut, Tripoli, Haifa, Alexandretta. If, however, no harbour construction work is undertaken at Beirut or Tripoli, Haifa will, on its completion, be the best port on the Syrian and Palestine coast. It would have the added advantage to shipping companies of being under British management.50. Sir John Cadman and Sir Henri Deterding have stated that the building of the Baghdad-Haifa Railway would be a determining factor in favour of a Baghdad-Haifa alignment for the pipelines and would outweigh the disadvantage of the higher cost involved by the longer line. We think that this statement can safely be accepted. If, however, no railway between Baghdad and Haifa is built we much doubt whether the Turkish Petroleum Company would lay their pipelines on that route, and we think on the whole that they will favour either the Alexandretta or Tripoli-Beirut routes.The Iraq Railway Position.51. In April 1923, the Iraq Government took over from the British Govern-ment the responsibility for the conduct of the Iraq Railway system for a period which will end in December, 1928. In 1925 the Hilton Young Financial Mission recommended inter alia that the ownership of the system should be transferred to a Corporation, a majority of the Directors of which should be appointed by the Iraq Government, and that the capital stock of the Corporation should be 500 lakhs of rupees, divided into 250 lakhs of Preferred Stock, which should be the property of the British Government, and 250 lakhs of Deferred Stock, which should be the property of the Iraq Government.52. The Iraq Government accepted the Financial Mission&apos;s recommendations in full. The British Government also accepted them in so far as they fixed the British Capital interest at 250 lakhs ( 1,875,000) (a considerable reduction on the figure at which this interest had previously been valued), but objected to the management of the railways being entrusted to a local board of Directors.53. In 1927 General Hammond reported that new capital, amounting to  2,100,000, was required to put the railways in a safe and workable condition and to meet the cost of necessary extensions and repairs, and urged that the British Government should give a covering guarantee so as to enable the new capital to be raised on a 5 per cent, basis.54. This proposal was supported by the Acting Secretary of State for the Colonies in a Memorandum (CP. 321 (27)) circulated to the Cabinet in December 1927. The Treasury objections to the proposal are set out in CP. 32 (28). It is there pointed out that, of General Hammond&apos;s figure of  2,100,000, only  1,100,000 was required for the principal undertakings recommended, namely :  Extension from Kirkuk to Mosul ... ...      690,000Baghdad Bridge ... ... ...      370,000Khanakin Extension      ... ... ...        40,000
and that the balance was needed for (a) improvements (which could, if need be, continue to be financed from Renewals or Depreciation Accounts), (b) for replenishing the Renewals Account, which could wait, or (c) for repaying temporary advances and for interest on capital during construction. In conclusion, the Treasury indicated ways in which the capital might be obtained on reasonable terms without resort to British credit.55. These Memoranda were considered by the Cabinet at their meeting on the 22nd February, 1928 (Cabinet 11 (28), Conclusion 5), when it was, in effect, decided to postpone consideration of the question of the future of the Iraq Railways until some conclusion had been reached on the Baghdad-Haifa railway question.56. This conclusion was communicated to Sir H. Dobbs, who, on the 1st May, telegraphed that King Feisal and the Prime Minister of Iraq were deeply concerned at the delay in reaching a decision. Both considered that it was of vital importance that the construction of the railway to Haifa should be undertaken at an early date; and that, if control of the existing Iraq railways was required by the capitalists willing to undertake such construction, Iraq would not oppose such control provided that (1) reasonable safeguards are made to ensure that the ultimate reversionary right of ownership of the existing railways remains with the Iraq Government, and (2) that the capitalists obtaining control undertake to construct an extension of the line from Kirkuk to Mosul at the earliest date after the control has been transferred to them.57. According to CP. 321 (27), paragraph 2, the Iraq Government have hitherto been opposed to any suggestion that their railways should be transferred to a foreign commercial group. It would, however, now seem from the above telegram that their attitude in this respect has changed.58. Sir H. Dobbs has been invited to ascertain whether the Iraq Government are prepared to assist in financing the Baghdad-Haifa Railway, and, if so, to what extent and in what manner, but, in view of the Syndicated offer (see paragraph 21 above) to build the line without assistance, the High Commissioner felt that the moment was not an opportune one for raising the matter with the Iraq Government.The Gauges of Middle Eastern Railways.59. Iraq. The existing railway from Baghdad to Basra and from Baghdad to Kirkuk and Kasr-i-Shirin has a metre gauge. The railway from Baghdad to Kalaat-Shergat (in the direction of Mosul) is standard gauge.60. Syria and Palestine. The Hedjaz Railway (Haifa-Deraa-Damascus-Beirut and south from Deraa via, Maan towards Mecca) has a 1 - 05 metre gauge.The Egyptian and Main Palestine railways and the Constantinople-Tripoli line (which it is proposed to extend along the coast via Beirut to Haifa, so giving direct rail connection between Constantinople and Egypt) have the standard gauge. So also has the extension of the Constantinople-Tripoli line from Aleppo to Nisibin.61. The adoption of a metre gauge for the Haifa-Baghdad railway would result in (a.) The presence of a third gauge in Haifa, creating almost insuperable diffi-culties in regard to transport arrangements at the docks.(b.) The Baghdad line being unable to carry the rolling-stock of the Turkish-Egyptian railways.(c.) The Baghdad Railway being unable to make use of the repair facilities already existing at Haifa for the standard gauge.62. The additional cost of the standard gauge over the metre is estimated at between  600,000 and  700,000, but, should a light 60-lb. rail be employed, a saving of  450,000 could be made on this amount. The cost of upkeep of the standard gauge would be slightly greater than that of the metre, but, as the traffic increased, this difference would decrease and eventually the standard would prove materially more economical.[17756] c 2
63.   The Committee of Imperial Defence, at their 230th Meeting, agreed that from a military point of view, there were advantages in the standard gauge, but that its adoption for the Baghdad-Haifa line was not essential.Political Considerations.64. France. If the British Government become financially interested, either directly or indirectly, in the construction of the Baghdad-Haifa railway or pipeline this fact cannot be concealed from the French Government, and any attempt to conceal it would be certain to result in misunderstandings. There is, however, no reason to anticipate that any foreign Government could object if the British Govern-ment decided to assist in the construction of the railway, even though its construction would determine the direction of the pipeline.65. Palestine. Under Article 17 of the Palestine Mandate, Great Britain as Mandatory, is entitled to use the roads, railways and ports of Palestine at all times for the movement of armed forces and the carriage of fuel and supplies. In effect, this provision would entitle the Mandatory to use Palestine as a base in time of war I in which case there could be no question of the territory remaining neutral, and it would be open to attack by the enemy of the Mandatory Power. It would appear to be clear that the provision of appropriate fortifications for the defence of the harbour of Haifa and of the terminal of the pipeline would be permissible under the terms of the mandate.66. It should be.poted that there is a similar provision in the Syrian mandate, and that accordingly France would be entitled to take similar measures in Syria.67. Iraq. Under the Treaty of 1922 and the connected instruments (known comprehensively as the &apos;&apos; Treaty of Alliance &apos;&apos;) no definite and specific obligation was placed upon Great Britain to give military assistance to Iraq to repel external aggression or to repress internal disorder. The view has, however, been accepted that such an obligation, in the event of unprovoked attack or disorder not occasioned by the action of the Iraq Government, is implicit in the terms of Article 8 of the Military Agreement (one of the &quot;connected instruments&quot; mentioned above). Whatever may be the theoretical position, Great Britain cannot in fact be neutral when Iraq is at war and while there is nothing actually in the treaty to prevent Iraq remaining neutral when Great Britain is at war, the situation created by the Treaty is such as to render such neutrality impracticable. The Treaty of Alliance is now under revision. A new Treaty was signed in December 1927, but has not yet been ratified.68. A new Military Agreement is under negotiation; its terms are likely to emphasise, rather than otherwise, the obligation to render military assistance to Iraq.69. The situation is, in fact, very similar to that which existed in Egypt prior to the war, subject to the consideration that the position of the British troops in Egypt was not dependent on a formal treaty as is the case in Iraq.70. Under the unratified Treaty of December, 1927, Great Britain has under-taken, provided all goes well, to support the candidature of Iraq for admission to the League of Nations in 1932. If admission is secured, British relations with Iraq will necessarily have to be revised. It is difficult, at this stage, to forecast the effect of such revision upon the military position and upon British military obligations in Iraq.71. The attitude of Iraq in relation to the French Administration of Syria might be expected to influence the Iraq Government against a Syrian alignment of the pipeline, and therefore in support of the Haifa route.72. The San Remo Agreement. If the pipeline was to terminate in Syria, the terminal point would, under the San Remo Agreement, require the assent of both the British and French Governments.   Should this line then be used by the Anglo-
63.   The Committee of Imperial Defence, at their 230th Meeting, agreed that from a military point of view, there were advantages in the standard gauge, but that its adoption for the Baghdad-Haifa line was not essential.Political Considerations.64. France. If the British Government become financially interested, either directly or indirectly, in the construction of the Baghdad-Haifa railway or pipeline this fact cannot be concealed from the French Government, and any attempt to conceal it would be certain to result in misunderstandings. There is, however, no reason to anticipate that any foreign Government could object if the British Covern ment decided to assist in the construction of the railway, even though its construction would determine the direction of the pipeline.65. Palestine.- Under Article 17 of the Palestine Mandate, Great Britain as Mandatory, is entitled to use the roads, railways and ports of Palestine at all times for the movement of armed forces and the carriage of fuel and supplies. In effect, this provision would entitle the Mandatory to use Palestine as a base in time of war, in which case there could be no question of the territory remaining neutral, and it would be open to attack by the enemy of the Mandatory &quot;Power. It would appear to be clear that the provision of appropriate fortifications for the defence of the harbour of Haifa and of the terminal of the pipeline would be permissible under the terms of the mandate.66. It should bepoted that there is a similar provision in the Syrian mandate, and that accordingly France would be entitled to take similar measures in Syria.67. Iraq.

The attitude of Iraq in relation to the French Administration of Syria might be expected to influence the Iraq Government against a Syrian alignment of the pipeline, and therefore in support of the Haifa route.72. The San Remo A greement. If the pipeline was to terminate in Syria, the terminal point would, under the San Perno Agreement, require the assent of both the British and French Governments.   Should this line then be used by the Anglo-
Persian Oil Company, the French Government would be able to claim up to 25 per cent, of the oil piped from Persia to the Mediterranean by that Company on terms to be arranged between the French Government and the Company.Strategical Considerations.73. The Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence have reported on the strategical position as follows : &quot; The strategic advantages to be obtained from the Baghdad-Haifa railway and. pipeline may be summarised as follows : (a.) The Fleet will possess a source of oil supply upon which reliance can be placed in the future, when the only other large British oil supply (in Persian territory) may, on account of political developments, become uncertain.(b.) The location of such a supply would be an advantage in the following ways :  (i.) In a war in the Home theatre it would be 1,000 miles nearer than any other British source of supply, (ii.) In a war with a Mediterranean Power it would be in immediatesupport of the Fleet, (iii.) In a war in the Far East it would be on the direct line of com-munications between Britain and the Far East, with a resultant saving in tanker tonnage.(c.) The Anglo-Persian Oil Company are expected, we understand, on com-pletion of the Baghdad-Haifa pipeline, to construct a pipeline from their south Persian fields to Baghdad; this will permit of the Persian oil supply and the Iraq oil supply being switched either to Haifa or Abadan, which may be advantageous to the Navy in war.(d.) Connecting, as it would, at one end with the railway to Cairo and at the other with the existing railway from Baghdad to Basra, this projected line would constitute a line of communication to the east which would be alternative or additional to the Suez Canal. It would considerably reduce the time taken to send reinforcements, whether in men or material, from the Mediterranean for the protection of British interests in Iraq and Persia in the event of our being engaged in a war in the Middle East or, in particular, with Russia. Thus it would markedly improve our defence organisation in the Near East.&quot;A copy of the Report is attached (Appendix 2).74. The Committee of Imperial Defence at their 230th Meeting agreed that, on strategic grounds, the construction of a railway from Baghdad to Haifa is desirable, provided that the western portion of the line runs entirely within territory under British influence.Defence Considerations.75. It would be an advantage, from the point of view of defence, if the overland and air routes were to be the same as that taken by the pipeline.76. The above-mentioned Report by the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee (Appendix 2) contains the following conclusions on the question of the defence of the Baghdad-Haifa pipeline :  &quot; It will be noted that the defence of an oil pipeline on a Baghdad-Haifa alignment entails no military commitment to Britain in any hostilities except those with Arab tribes or France. Should hostilities with Arab tribes materialise to such an extent as to require the introduction of an organised system of defence, the commitment would not exceed 2 battalions and 8 sections of armoured cars, if all posts were manned.In the case of war with France, however, the defence of the pipeline will entail the presence of Imperial forces at Haifa prior to the outbreak of war
amounting to an infantry brigade, with a proportion of other arms and aircraft, and the organisation of defences at pumping stations garrisoned by additional troops amounting to 2 battalions and 40 guns.The existence of the railway alongside the oil pipeline is of the greatest importance to the defence of the pipeline and to enable repairs to be effected in as short a time as possible.There are no flying facilities at Haifa at present, and the provision of an aerodrome and seaplane station there is necessary.&quot;The Advantages to Great Britain, Iraq and Palestine, respectively, of the Construction of a Baghdad-Haifa Railway.77. Great Britain. The benefits to be derived by Great Britain from the con-struction of the railway are strategical and economic. The strategical advantages are set out in paragraph 73 above; economically, Great Britain would benefit by the general expansion of Middle Eastern trade, and by the existence of the terminal of a big oil supply at a port under British control in the Mediterranean. The develop-ment of the Middle Eastern oil-fields would also strengthen the position of British Oil interests and make Britain less dependent upon American supplies.78. Iraq is mainly interested in seeing that the revenue to be derived from the royalty of 45. a ton on oil produced in Iraq territory is secure. The existence of this railway would also assist the development of Iraq generally, and in particular as a cotton- and grain-producing area.79. Palestine would benefit by the fact that Haifa would become the sea port of Palestine, Iraq, and to some extent Persia and Syria, while the presence of the railway would facilitate the development of Trans-Jordan. Moreover, an impetus would be given to the trade of the port of Haifa by the demand for labour for the refineries and large tank storage, which would be built at Haifa, and the transport work necessary for the railway, pipeline and oilfields.80. The Persian trade to and from the West would find an advantageous route via Baghdad and Haifa, but Persia might attempt to impose obstacles against traffic with Iraq so as to assist the proposed railway from Teheran to Khor Musa.81. The Oil Companies and the Baghdad-Haifa Railway. Up to the present the Oil Companies have given no indication as to what, if any, financial responsibility they will be prepared to assume in regard to the construction of a Baghdad-Haifa railway, which would be of advantage to them in the following ways : (a.) Saving in cost of initial pipeline construction.(b.) Saving in cost of subsequent pipeline construction as the output of the oil-fields increased.(c.) Saving and facility of maintaining the pumping stations.(d.) Saving in time in effecting repairs to the pipeline, at the pumping stations or at the oil-fields.(e.) Assistance in the matter of police work.(/.) Transport of material estimated at 50,000 tons per annum.The British elements in the Turkish Petroleum Company have been reluctant to commit themselves in advance for political reasons and also for fear of antagonising certain of the foreign elements in that Company by appearing to force them to accept a Haifa rather than a Syrian terminal for the pipeline. Recently, Sir John Cadman has expressed the opinion that when the British Oil Development Syndicate have withdrawn their proposals, it will be possible for him to persuade the Board of the Turkish Petroleum Company to participate in a Baghdad-Haifa railway scheme, and that there was little doubt that the Oil Companies would agree to bear their share in financing the construction of the railway.82. If the Baghdad-Haifa railway is built as an independent undertaking, the arrangements between the Railway Company and the Oil Companies will have to comprise, inter alia, provisions for the annual payments to be made to the Railway Company by the Oil Companies in respect of the way-leaves for the pipelines.
SIR ALBERT STERN&apos;S PROPOSALS. Estimates of the Cost, Profits, &amp;c, of the Baghdad-Haifa Railway.83. No detailed survey of the Baghdad-Haifa railway has yet been made, but after a preliminary survey General Mance submitted a Report to the promoters in which he estimated the total cost at about  8,000,000. In order to be on the safe side, and after taking the opinion of their Consulting Engineers, Sir Albert Stern and Mr. Tiarks have adopted the higher figure of  10,000,000. On the assumption that the railway will cost  10,000,000, the promoters suggest that the capital should be found (a) as to  6,000,000 by the issue by the Governments of Palestine and Iraq of  2,000,000 and  4,000,000 Bonds respectively; and (&amp;) as to  4,000,000 by the issue of Debentures to be secured by a first charge on the railway without any guarantee. It is proposed that the service of the Bonds of the Iraq and Palestine Governments should be secured by the grant by the two Governments of annual subsidies for 50 years of an amount equal to 5 per cent, of their gross revenues for the year 1926, and that the payment of these subsidies should be guaranteed by the British Government. On this basis the subsidies would be Iraq,  208,000 per annum, Palestine,  128,000 per annum. It is further proposed that the Railway Company should have a share capital, of which 20 per cent, is to be allotted to the British Government in respect of their guarantee, and the balance to the underwriters of the  4,000,000 Railway Company Debentures, the promoters and other interests.84. It will be observed that while (a) is covered as to interest and sinking fund charges by the guaranteed subsidies, and (6) by the assumed net profits of the under-taking, the share capital is purely paper.85. The promoters estimate that in the early stages working expenses will absorb 80 per cent, to 90 per cent, of the gross receipts, and they forecast a net revenue of  245,000 per annum after the railway&apos;s fifth year of working. Given favourable conditions they expect that the railway will be in a position in 20 years&apos; time to earn a reasonable return on that part of its capital which is not covered by the Iraq and Palestine subsidies.86. In the opinion of the promoters, (a) the railway can never pay without the pipeline; (6) the completion of the Alexandretta-Baghdad railway will mean intense competition, and the Baghdad-Haifa railway could then only survive if the pipeline existed beside it; and (c) without the assistance in some form or other of the British Government the railway could not be built.87. So far as we are able to judge from the information before us, we think it improbable that the Baghdad-Haifa railway will be able to pay interest on the cost of construction for many years to come. In this connection a great deal must depend on the extent of the development of the Iraq oil industry and the absence of effective railway competition.Conclusion regarding Sir A. Stern&apos;s Proposal.88. We are unable to recommend that the Stern proposals should be entertained. Our reasons for this conclusion may be summarised as follows : (a.) In effect, the British, Iraq and Palestine Governments are invited to under-take the responsibility for 60 per cent, of the cost, but not to share to any comparable extent in any future prosperity which the railway may enjoy.(b.) The suggested guarantee by His Majesty&apos;s Government of the Iraq and-Palestine subsidies would be in direct conflict with the Governments financial policy of avoiding commitments of this character. In effect, the proposals mean that the British Government should indirectly assume full responsibility for  6 millions out of the  10 millions capital of the railway.(c) The proposals would involve legislation which it Avould be difficult to reconcile with the policy of liquidating Middle Eastern commitments, and which could hardly be expected to commend itself, on its merits, to Parliament.
(d.) In a recent telegram Sir H. Dobbs has stated emphatically that there is not the slightest prospect of Iraq even considering the suggestion that she should contribute a large subsidy ( 220,000 per annum) for 50 years.(e.) The Palestine Government cannot afford to pay a long-term subsidy.(/.) The fact that relations between Great Britain and Iraq may come under review in 1932, and may then be radically altered, is in itself a serious objection to the suggestion that the Iraq subsidy should be guaranteed by His Majesty&apos;s Government. (Short-term subsidies are stated by the promoters to be useless to them.)Suggestions for meeting Objections to the Stern Scheme.89. Our examination of various suggestions which have been made to meet the objections to the Stern proposals has resulted as follows :  90. The High Commissioner for Iraq has suggested that His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment should surrender their interest ( 1,800,000) in the Iraq railways on the under-standing that the assets so provided should be employed in aid of the construction of the Haifa-Baghdad railway.This proposal is based on the supposition that the British Government^ interest is an asset which, if transferred to the Iraq Government, could be utilised by that Government to raise money for the purpose of the Haifa-Baghdad railway this, of course, is not the case.91. It has also been suggested that the British Government should guarantee the difference between expenditure and revenue of the Haifa-Baghdad railway for a period of years. To guarantee the Company operating the railway against loss would remove any incentive on the part of the Company to make a financial success of the railway. This would virtually entail the railway becoming a Government-owned undertaking.92. Another suggestion is to the effect that the British Government should allocate a portion of the dividends received in respect of the holding in the Anglo-Persian Oil Company towards the cost of the construction of the railway. The proposal would require legislation. If a subsidy to the Haifa Railway is to be paid by the British Government there seems no very good reason why a particular receipt should be earmarked for the purpose. To do so would be contrary to usual practice and might result in difficulties; for example, the Anglo-Persian Oil Company might pass a dividend altogether (they have, in fact, just passed their 1928 Interim). It is not clear how the holding of the British Government in the Anglo-Persian Oil Company would be improved by devoting part of the dividends to the cost of the Haifa railway.93. We have considered whether it would be practicable to make some arrange-ment which would, apart altogether from the provision of the railway, ensure that the pipelines would be taken to Haifa. The following schemes have been suggested, but for the reasons indicated below we are unable to recommend their adoption : (a.) A payment might be offered to the Turkish Petroleum Company of such an amount as would induce the Company to adopt the Haifa alignment. The money to be provided by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, the Iraq Government, the Palestine Government and the British Government.Such an offer would probably result in counter-offers being made by the French Government, and political difficulties would be certain to arise.(&amp;.) The Iraq Government, which may prefer that the export of the oil should not be under French control, to require the Turkish Petroleum Company to lay their pipeline on the Haifa route while in Iraq territory.The British Government could not support such a requirement for political reasons.(c.) The offer by the British Government or the Government of Palestine of facilities at Haifa to the Turkish Petroleum Company in the form of land for refineries and tank farm, reduction or elimination of harbour dues for tankers, water and electric power, &amp;c.
94. All these advantages could also be offered by the French or Syrian Govern-nients at a Syrian port, and, although such offers by the Palestine Government might not lead to political difficulties between France and Britain, it seems doubtful whether any proposition of this kind could be made sufficiently attractive to the Company.SUMMARY OF ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES.95. The Chiefs of Staff summarised the strategic considerations in favour of the Haifa-Baghdad pipe-line and railway in the following terms : &quot; The proposed scheme for a pipe-line and railway from Baghdad to Haifa is of the greatest strategical importance in connection with the supply of oil fuel to the Navy at Home, in the Mediterranean and on the route to the Far East, and, in addition, should greatly strengthen the whole of our defensive organisa-tion in the Near East by facilitating the transport of men and munitions to Iraq for the defence of our interests in those regions.&quot;96. On the political side, the construction of a railway and pipe-line through Iraq and British Mandated Territory would strengthen Great britain&apos;s position in the Middle East and would prove an important factor, no less from the political and economic than the strategic point of view, in the consolidation of British influence throughout those regions. Further, it will tend to check the growth of French and Turkish influence at the expense of Britain, which a Syrian alignment would encourage.97.   Among the economic advantages are : (a.) Britain would be far less dependent upon the import of oil from countries outside British influence, an advantage both in peace and war.(&amp;.) Britain would obtain the virtual control over the output of what may well prove to be one of the richest oil-fields in the world.98. The principal objections which might be raised to the construction of the railway are (a.) Its existence would add to Great Britain&apos;s Defence commitments. The liability would, however, be a negligible one in any war except a war with France.(6.) Its construction cannot be justified as a commercial proposition, and if, as seems probable, it will not, in fact, be built without Government financial assistance, the offer of such assistance would be open to serious criticism on financial and political grounds.GENERAL   CONCLUSIONS.99. In the absence of any action on the part of the British Government, we think that there is considerable danger of the Turkish Petroleum Company adopting a Syrian terminal for their pipe-lines. In this event, the prospect of a railway between Baghdad and Haifa being built is extremely remote.100. The position as regards the intervention of the British Oil Development Syndicate is set out in a recent memorandum (CP. 164 (28)) circulated to the Cabinet by the Secretary of State for the Colonies. The present situation is obscure and at the moment we are not in a position to estimate the importance of the Syndicated activities. We doubt, however, whether the Syndicate or any other independent Corporation would be willing to construct the Baghdad-Haifa railway merely relying upon its right to bid at auction for oil concessions, regard being had to the considerations set out in paragraphs 21 to 23 above.101. We have come to the conclusion that there is only one way of placing it beyond doubt that the pipe-lines will be laid in British-controlled territory, and that is by making arrangements for the construction of a Baghdad-Haifa railway in collaboration with the Oil Companies. It is true that the British Oil Development Syndicate have made an offer to build the railway which at first sight may seem attractive. But it appears probable that they will require assistance from the British Government, the nature and extent of which is at present unknown, but which may approximate to the proposals made by Sir A. Stern. In that event, the objections [17756] d
set out in this Report to the Stern proposals would apply with equal force to those of the Syndicate. In any case, the whole position is so obscure and uncertain that we cannot regard the Syndicated proposals as a satisfactory basis for a solution of the Baghdad-Haifa railway question in the absence of more detailed information.102. Having regard to these considerations, we think that it may be safely assumed that that railway will not, in fact, be constructed in the near future as an independent commercial venture, and that it can only be built with the assistance of contributions from the Oil Companies or the interested Governments, or both. It is possible that within the next few months the Oil Companies may have determined on their line of polic)^, and may then approach the British Government with a view to ascertaining what measure of support and financial assistance will be forthcoming from the Governments concerned. It is, of course, also possible that the Turkish. Petroleum Company might approach the French and Iraq Governments with the object of obtaining their assistance in the construction of a railway with a shorter Syrian alignment.103. In our view it is certain that the railway must be run at a loss in its initial stages and it may well be many years before it reaches the stage (if it ever does so) of paying interest on the full cost of its construction. If, however, the Cabinet decide that the strategic and other notable advantages which the railway would confer on Great Britain outweigh the pecuniary sacrifices involved, we think that the Government would be justified in offering at the appropriate time the minimum of financial assistance required to enable the railway undertaking to proceed.Conditions of Government Aid.104. We do not think that any action is necessary, or indeed desirable, at the moment. If, however, proposals are submitted in the near future by or on behalf of the Oil Companies for participation in the construction of a Baghdad-Haifa railway, and if the Cabinet decide in principle to assist in the construction of such a railway, we think that their assent should be subject to the acceptance by the other interested parties of the following among other conditions (a.) That the British Government are satisfied as to the financial status of theundertakers and as to the capitalisation proposals. (b.) That the British, Iraq and Palestine Governments should together contributean amount not exceeding  3 millions in the aggregate towards the costof the undertaking, in such proportions as may be agreed between thethree Governments.(c.) That the Oil Companies should participate in the construction of the railway by undertaking to subscribe for (and retain) at least one-third of the capital of the Railway Company.(d.) That the participation of the Governments in the Railway Company should be in such a form as will enable them to share in any future prosperity the Company may enjoy.(e.) That the Oil Companies should bind themselves in advance to lay their pipelines alongside the railway on such terms as to w&amp;y leaves, &amp;c, as may be agreed between the Oil Companies and the Railway Company.SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS.105. We summarise below the more important conclusions and recommendations contained in this Report-(1.) The prospects of the future production of large quantities of oil in Iraq are sufficiently assured to justify the British Government in endeavouring to secure the Baghdad-Haifa alignment for the pipelines (paragraph 11).(2.) It may be safely assumed that the Turkish Petroleum Company will try to defer a decision as to pipeline alignment for as long as possible, and that in any event it is probable that pipeline construction will not be started within the next 18 months (paragraph 25).(3.) Any decision respecting the Baghdad-Haifa railway should be based on the assumption that the Aleppo-Nisibin-Mosul-Baghdad railway will eventually be completed (paragraph 38).(4.) The Baghdad-Haifa route is probably on the whole the most secure; it also has the assured prospect of satisfactory harbour facilities at Haifa and of being within territory under British influence and protection.
Against these advantages must be put the far heavier cost of pipeline provision and maintenance due to the longer distance (paragraph 48).(5.) If a Baghdad-Haifa railway is built the pipeline will go to Haifa, if it is not built the Turkish Petroleum Company are likely to favour either the Alexandretta or Tripoli-Beirut routes (paragraph 50).(6.) There is no reason to anticipate that any foreign Government could object if the British Government decided to assist in the construction of the Baghdad-Haifa Railway even though its construction would determine the direction of the pipeline (paragraph 64).(7.) The attitude of Iraq in relation to the Trench Administration of Syria may be expected to influence the Iraq Government against a Syrian alignment of the pipeline and in support of the Haifa route (paragraph 73).(8.) We are unable to recommend (a) that Sir A. Stern&apos;s proposals for the con-struction of the Baghdad-Haifa railway should be accepted (para-graph 85),, or (b) that the various suggestions which have been made for meeting the objections to those proposals should be entertained (paragraphs 88-94).(9.) The whole - position as regards the British Oil Development Syndicate is very obscure. If, however, as would appear to be the case, the Syndicated proposals involve financial assistance from the British Government, they are open to the same objections as the Stern proposals. It seems doubtful whether any arrangement will be reached between the Turkish Petroleum Company and the British Oil Development Syndicate. In the absence of any arrangement, it is difficult to see how the Syndicate are to succeed in obtaining the oil concessions, the grant of which&apos;would seem to be an essential condition to their offer to build the Baghdad-Haifa railway free of cost to the Iraq Government. In view of the uncertainty of the position, the Syndicated proposals cannot, in the absence of more detailed information, be regarded as a satisfactory basis for a solution of the railway question (paragraphs 21, 25, 100 and 101). (10.) There is only one way of placing it beyond doubt that the pipelines will be laid in British-controlled territory, and that is by making arrangements for the construction of the Baghdad-Haifa railway in collaboration with the Oil Companies. The railway will not be constructed in the near future as an independent commercial venture, and can only be built with financial assistance from the Oil Companies or the interested Governments or both. It is possible that the Oil Companies might approach the British Government in the near future with a view to ascertaining what support might be given by the Governments concerned to the Baghdad-Haifa Railway scheme. It is also possible that the Turkish Petroleum Company might approach the French and Iraq Governments with the object of obtaining their assistance in the construction of a railway with a shorter Syrian alignment (paragraphs 101 and 102).(11.) In view of the uncertainty which at present surrounds the whole matter, no action is necessary or desirable at the moment. If, however, proposals are submitted in the near future by or on behalf of the Oil Companies for participation in the construction of a Baghdad-Haifa railway, and if the Cabinet decide in principle to assist in the construction of such a railway, their assent should be subject to the acceptance by the other interested parties, inter alia, of the conditions set out in the last paragraph of the Report (paragraph 104).Signed on behalf of the Sub-Committee,STANHOPE (Chairman).(Signed)      R.

Appendix 1.[Paper No. C.B.R. 7.] -EVIDENCE OF EXISTENCE OF OIL IN IRAQ.Memorandum by Sir John Cadman.1. The existence of oil in Iraq has been known almost since the dawn of history. The seepages in the Euphrates Valley and in the northern part of Iraq have supplied the local tribes with illuminants and building materials for many centuries. For many years past these seepages had been the object of scientific investigation, but it was the discovery of oil in commercial quantities in South Persia by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company which focussed attention on the commercial possibilities of Iraq, since scientific investigations had already indicated that geological formations in Iraq were merely an extension of those in Persia. This interest was stimulated by the British occupation of Iraq during the Great War. ^In Persia, oil is found in well defined anti-clines of tertiary beds of a clearly established nature, namely, the so-called Asmari Limestone of Burdigalian age. As the above-mentioned geological investigations had suggested that the same tertiary beds exist under similar structural conditions in Iraq, there was every prospect of encountering a similar accumulation of oil there. Before proceeding to a narrative of the actual results rewarding an attempt to test these general theories, it may be of interest to refer briefly to the history of the Company under whose auspices the work has been conducted.2. The Turkish Petroleum Company (so-named in 1912 after having been registered under another name in 1911) was reconstituted in the early part of 1914. On the 28th June, 1914, as the result of pressure applied to the Turkish Government by the British and German Ambassadors, the Grand Vizier wrote as follows to the latter : &quot; The Ministry of Finance, which has taken over from the Civil List matters concerning petroleum deposits already discovered or to be discovered in the Villayets of Mosul and Baghdad, agrees to lease them to the Turkish Petroleum Company, and reserves the right later on to fix its own share as well as the general terms of the Agreement.&apos;&apos;Before arrangements could be made for enforcing this undertaking, the Great War broke out, and it was not until January 1922 that a formal claim was made upon the Government of Iraq to have the Company&apos;s rights under the Turkish Govern-menfs promise recognised and embodied in a definite instrument.3. Discussions with the Iraq Government as to the terms of the Concession to be granted to the Company started in 1923, but it was not until the 14th March, 1925, that these terms were ultimately embodied in a Convention, which was signed on behalf of the Government of Iraq by the Minister of Communications and Works.4. This Convention granted to the Turkish Petroleum Company the exclusive right to explore for petroleum and allied substances in the Villayets of Baghdad and Mosul, excluding the &quot; Transferred Territories,&quot; for a period of 75 years. The Company was to commence a detailed survey within 8 months of the date of the. Convention; within 32 months after date of the Convention, it was to select 24 rectangular plots, each of an area of 8 square miles; and within 3 years from the date of the Convention, it was to start drilling operations. Subsequently to those three years (a) the Company was to drill not less than 12,000 feet per year until such time as it had proved its plots; and it was to order a pipeline to a port for export shipment as soon as that course should become commercially justifiable; and concurrently (p\ the Government of Iraq was to select annually not less than 24 rectangular plots, each of an area of 8 square miles, which were to be offered for competition to all and sundry responsible parties desiring the same, irrespective of nationality. The Company was bound to act as the Governments Agent for that purpose; ultimately, the Company would receive the proceeds of any sale. Of the remaining provisions, the more material were two : (1) that of any pipeline constructed, 30 per .cent. of its capacity should be available for transportation of oil
won by the lessees of plots put up for tender; and (2) that on all oil produced, the Government should receive a royalty at the rate of 4s. (Four shillings) per ton until 20 years after completion of the pipeline, and subsequently at an adjusted rate.The limitation of the period between the date of the Convention and the date upon which plots were to be selected should be specially observed; since a period of 32 months in respect of a total area of 50,000 square miles necessarily imposed most restrictive limits upon exploratory work, preventing the slow and systematic develop-ment of a thorough scheme of geological investigation reinforced by the drill.5. Of all the work done in Iraq prior to 1925, that of Sir Edwin Pascoe, D.Sc, Director of the Geological Survey of India, who was deputed by the Government of India to make a Geological Reconnaissance in Iraq during the cold season of 1918-19. is outstanding. His Notes were published in Volume XLVIII of the &quot; Memoirs of the Geological Survey of India.&quot; Sir Edwin Pascoe, after affirming the similarity of geological formations between Persia and Iraq, clearly defined seventeen structures in which he considered that oil could be obtained, with a greater or less degree of certainty, in remunerative quantities.A little later, Messrs. Noble and Evans, Petroleum Geologists of high talent and wide experience, carried out a study of the same areas and reached almost the same conclusions.6. The Turkish Petroleum Company&apos;s Survey Party of 1925-26, under the leadership of Professor de Bockh (Geological Adviser to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, and an international geologist of great reputation), extended the geological information previously obtained to a degree of precision sufficient to enable actual structures to be selected for testing. In so doing, however, they laid it down that production would depend on the existence of certain conditions in the Asmari Limestone the producing horizon of Persia. They had some difficulty in defining in what precise areas these assumed conditions would be found to exist, and their recommendations were therefore confined to structures, directly in prolongation of those in Persia, in which the postulated conditions were believed to attend the Asmari Limestone. Actually, 12 anticlines were regarded as potential oil producers, and, in particular, seven were recommended for test five to be tested by one well in the first instance and two by two wells.7. Upon these recommendations it was decided on the 2nd September, 1926, to put down test wells at the following ten locations : Injanah.Kliasm-al-Ahmar. Palkanah No. 1.Palkanah No. 2. Jambur.Baba Gurgur. Tarjil.Kor Mor Ali Khan Beg. Qaiyarah. Jabal Khanuqah.The situation of these locations is shown on the appended maps.* Iraq being still a very primitive country, almost totally lacking any system of communications, a definite limit was necessarily imposed upon the exploratory activity of the Company. These conditions, together with the paramount factor of the limited time allowed for survey by the terms of the Convention, prevented the immediate testing of all promising structures, and, in fact, restricted the feasible drilling programme to a scheme of 8 strings of tools deferring tests at Kor Mor Ali Khan Beg and Jabal Khanuqah. (Fortunately, two of those eight test wells have yielded results of such a nature that the prospects of the six other structures under test can be assessed with some confidence.)8. The first definitive evidence of the presence of oil in Iraq was yielded by substantial showings met with at Palkanah No. 1, at a depth of 1,302 feet, on the 31st May, 1927. Unfortunately, drilling mishaps prevented the completion of the well, which had to be abandoned towards the close of the year. After meeting with several promising showings of oil, Qaiyarah No. 1 reached the pay-sand at between 760 and 780 feet, with an aggregate production of over 5,000 barrels (700 tons) per day. In the hope of securing further geological information, this well was subsequently drilled to a depth of 1,770 feet, without, however, yielding additional important data.* Not reproduced.
These results established the thickness of the continuous limestone at 755 feet, of which, however, only some 40 feet at the top contained oil.9. A few months later, on the 14th October, 1927, Baba Gurgur No. 1 struck oil at a depth of 1,521 feet, its flow during the first twenty-four hours being estimated at 90,000 barrels (13,000 tons), subsequently continuing for eight days at an estimated flow of 50,000 to 60,000 barrels (7,000 to 8,500 tons) per day. The well was then safely capped, and it remains ready for production. This was an event of the utmost significance, and must ever mark an epoch in the development of oil in Iraq.10. All remains in readiness for the drilling of other wells on each of these productive structures namely, Palkanah, Qaiyarah and Baba Gurgur. Meanwhile, drilling proceeds at five other wells, and their depths (March 1927) are as followsFeet.Injanah... ... ... ... ...      3,306Jambur Khasm-al-Ahmar Tarjil   ... Palkanah No. 22,949 2.838 2,734 1,892Unfortunately, drilling at Jambur, Khasm-al-Ahmar and Palkanah No. 2 is encountering great difficulty and progress is slow. At the other two locations, however, progress is fairly steady, but neither at Injanah nor Tarjil are there signs of proximity to the main limestone.11. Concurrently with the pursuance of the drilling programme, further geological evidence has been obtained from reconnaissance work carried out by the Company&apos;s geologists during the winter of 1926-27. This corroborates the evidence of the results obtained at Qaiyarah and Baba Gurgur, and tends to afford indications of additional structures, more especially in the Mosul Vilayet.12. So much for narrative. Before attempting a general assessment of prospects, the data obtained will be briefly discussed. The well at Baba Gurgur is situated only 5 miles from railhead, and the shape and dimensions of the structure, as now visualised, promise here a very rich field. The major anticline is well defined and of great size in all, 21 miles in length. It is divided into sections, however, one of which measures over 3 miles long by \ to f mile wide, covering a definite apex in the fold where a maximum accumulation can be expected. Tarjil and Kor Mor Ali Khan Beg are similarlv situated, each on an apex of the same huge anticline.The Qaiyarah fold is also a well-defined anticline, but of a less elongated type. A section 4 miles long by f mile wide covers the highest portion of the fold and reveals another promising area, although in this area the smaller thickness of primary formations responsible for oil accumulations tends to restrict production. The other structures now under test reveal the same general characteristics of accumulation, namely, sharply folded anticlines with extensive drainage areas, and a reservoir rock which would seem to be of similar nature and thickness to that at Baba Gurgur. In these structures, however, the producing horizon must be expected at a somewhat greater depth, owing to an increase in the thickness of the cap rock towards the South-East.13. The present phase is notable equally by reason of the definitive evidence obtained, and of the immense range of further information revealed as being essential to any attempt at a final delimitation of the oil-bearing fields of Iraq. To sum up what has been definitely achieved :  Neither at Baba Gurgur nor Qaiyarah is the producing well to be regarded as emblematic of freak conditions, and it is thought safe to say that substantial production (as distinct from the potentiality of enormous production) could be relied upon from each additional well drilled in the vicinity of the existing wells.To strike oil in such quantities as obtained at Baba Gurgur, and that within a limited period of months from the inception of the geological survey, must be regarded as an event of quite unexampled good fortune; and one which, in con-junction with the other results obtained, furnishes a complete vindication of the expenditure to date and of the operative methods adopted.
Despite, therefore, the necessarily rudimentary nature of exploratory operations, the existence of oil in substantial commercial quantities has been definitely established, and there has been opened up the promise of one field, or possibly several fields, of great richness.14. Given an extension of the exploratory period, the evidence to be secured from a deliberate and well co-ordinated drilling scheme must necessarily supersede and modify the conclusions already indicated. In particular, the existence of an oil-producing belt stretching from Persia to Turkey will, in due course, be finally corroborated or modified, as will the lesser theory that all the structures now believed to be oil-bearing form what is essentially one unit. In any event, the geological characteristics already noted would appear to be similar to those familiarly encountered in Persia, and every care will be taken to apply the lessons learned in the latter country to the problems of Iraq as these are successively unfolded. As in Persia, so in Iraq, the drill must be used in order to establish the marginal limits of the respective fields, and without the data so afforded any speculation as to nature and volume of reserves must be in terms both general and tentative. Given the results of general drilling, both along and across the structures, together with some approximation to the delimitation of the margins, a real computation of reserves can be confidently approached.15. Pending such evidence, any decision to construct a pipeline must be regarded as premature, although many pipelines have been built on slighter evidence than that which Iraq now affords.2, Whitehall Gardens, S. W. 1, March 28, 1928.The information as to oil production in Iraq contained in Sir J. Cadmans memorandum has been brought up to date in the following note prepared by the Colonial Office :  Note.From reports which have been received from Baghdad, it appears that in the area in Iraq which is covered by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company&apos;s concession in the Transferred Territories there are at present three wells in which oil has been discovered.In Well No. T. 6, production started in 1926. The oil produced from that well is refined at the local refinery at Alwand, and is now considered to be more than sufficient to meet the requirements of the local market.On 16th May, 1928, oil was struck at Well No. T. 10 where the production is estimated at 140,000 gallons of oil per day at a pressure of 240 lbs. per square inch.On the 18th May, 1928, oil was struck at Well No. T. 11 and the estimated production of this well is 300,000 gallons of oil per day at a pressure of 1,250 lbs. per square inch.Oil was also struck on the 25th April, 1928, at Well No. T. 13 where the produc-tion is estimated at 450,000 gallons per day, but this ivell is on the Persian side of the frontier.As regards the area covered by the Turkish Petroleum Company&apos;s concession in Iraq, oil was struck in quantity at No. 1 well at Baba Gurgur on the 14th October, 1927. The oil flowed for a period of eight days before the well could be tapped down. During this period the rate of production was very high, but no accurate estimate of that rate could be made. No further oil was produced at this well until December, since when arrangements have been made to supphy fuel oil to the Company&apos;; workings in the vicinity. Oil for the same purpose has also been produced from two wells at Qaiyara, but so far as we are aware there have been no further strikes of oil in quantity within the area covered by the Turkish Petroleum Company? concession. Nor has oil been produced within that area except for the Company&apos;; own use.
Despite, therefore, the necessarily rudimentary nature of exploratory operations, the existence of oil in substantial commercial quantities has been definitely established, and there has been opened up the promise of one field, or possibly several fields, of great richness.14.

Appendix 2.[C.I.D. Paper No. 884-B :Also Paper No. C.O.S. 157.]THE BAGHDAD-HAIFA PIPELINE AND RAILWAY.Strategic Importance and Defence.Report by the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee.1. AT the request of the Chairman of the Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence, which has been considering the question of the proposed Haifa-Baghdad Railway and Pipeline, the Prime Minister referred to the Committee of Chiefs of Staff the subject of the defence of the suggested railway and pipeline, and of the defences which would be necessary to ensure the protection of Haifa in the event of it being decided that that port should be utilised for oil-fuelling purposes by the Fleet. Lord Stanhope, the Chairman of the said Sub-Committee, in a letter dated the 20th March, asked, in particular, that his Sub-Committee might be informed on the following points : (1.) The nature of the protection which it would be necessary to provide for the Haifa-Baghdad pipeline, whether in time of peace or in the event of Great Britain being involved in a Avar on the alternative assumptions that France is (a) neutral, (b) hostile.(2.) The effect on the measures of protection in (1) above of the construction of a railway alongside the pipeline.(3.) The nature of the defences which would be necessary to secure the protec-tion of Haifa with its oil resources and facilities in time of war, and approximate estimates of (a) the capital cost of such defences, and (5) the annual charge for their upkeep and maintenance in time of peace.2. Before setting forth our recommendations on the subject of defence, we desire to take this opportunity to state our views as to the strategic importance of the project for a pipeline and railway from Haifa to Baghdad. We are aware that the strategic importance of the railway has already been under consideration by the Committee of Imperial Defence in November last (230th Meeting, Minute 1, and C.I.D. Paper No. 830-B). At that time, however, the question of a pipeline as well as of the railway was not definitely before the Committee, and the Conclusions of the Committee of Imperial Defence were limited to supporting, on strategical grounds, the construction of the proposed railway. The proposal for a pipeline as well as a railway, however, greatly enhances the interest and importance of the scheme.Strategic Considerations.3. The strategic advantages to be obtained from the Baghdad-Haifa railway and pipeline may be summarised as follows : (a.) The Fleet will possess a source of oil supply upon which reliance can be placed in the future when the only other large British oil supply (in Persian territory) may, on account of political developments, become uncertain.[17756]E
(6.) The location of such a supply would be an advantage in the following; ways :  6(i.) In a war in the Home theatre it would be 1,000 miles nearer than any other British source of supply, (ii.)   In a war with a Mediterranean Power it would be in immediatesupport of the fleet, (iii.) In a war in the Far East it would be on the direct line of communica-tions between Britain and the Far East, with a resultant saving in tanker tonnage.(c.) The Anglo-Persian Oil Company are expected, we understand, on completion of the Baghdad-Haifa pipeline, to construct a pipeline from their South Persian fields to Baghdad; this will permit of the Persian oil supply and the Iraq oil supply being switched either to Haifa or Abadan, which would be advantageous to the Navy in war.(d.) Connecting as it would at one end with the railway to Cairo, and at the other with the existing railway from Baghdad to Basra, this projected line would constitute a line of communication to the east, which would be alternative or additional to the Suez Canal. It would considerably reduce the time taken to send reinforcements, whether in men or material, from the Mediterranean for the protection of British interests in Iraq and Persia in the event of our being engaged in a war in the Middle East or, in particular, with Russia. Thus it would markedly improve our defence organisation in the Near East.4. The principal disadvantage is certain added commitments in regard to defence. This, however, is small except in the case of a war with France, and is completely out-weighed by the advantages. In these circumstances, we consider that it is of the greatest importance that the pipeline and railway should be kept within British territory.The Defence of Haifa.5. In considering the question of the defence of Haifa, the first point to which we had to direct our attention was the question of whether it was permissible, under the terms of the Palestine Mandate, to construct fortifications. In regard to this, we are advised by the Foreign Office that &quot; the provision of appropriate fortifications for the defence of the harbour and of the terminal of the pipeline, if constructed, appears clearly to be permissible under the terms of the Mandate.&quot; (See&apos; Appendix to Paper No. C.O.S. 133.)6. After careful Consideration, we have reached the conclusion that Haifa should be placed in the category of Class &quot; C &quot; ports, the definition of which is as follows : Places at which it will not be necessary to install defences in peace time, but for which defence schemes should be prepared to meet probable war requirements.&quot;On our recommendation the question of the detailed defences was referred to the Oversea Defence Committee, whose report (Paper No. C.O.S. 151) is attached (Annexure I). The recommendations of the Oversea Defence Committee are summarised as follows : &quot; (A.) Naval and Military Defences.To secure the port of Haifa against attack by a European Naval Power, the Oversea Defence Committee consider that the following would be necessary : Local Naval Defences. An anti-torpedo baffle net, or alternatively, an indicator loop system, either of which is estimated to cost approximately  12,000. (This figure will require revision when the plans for the proposed harbour at Haifa are definitely approved.) Two auxiliary minesweepers and 4 anti-submarine vessels would also be required.
Gun Defences. At Haifa, two batteries of 2 6-inch guns each and 2 lights. Also, one battery of 2 6-inch guns at Acre, if the latter place is garrisoned.These defences are recommended on the assumption that hitherto existing methods of coast defence are adhered to.(B.) Peace-time A rrangements.It is proposed that the material for the above defences should be stored at Malta. Also, that the necessary personnel for the guns and lights should be furnished by the Malta garrison, the latter being reinforced from home as soon as possible.(C.)-Cost.The capital cost of the Local Naval Defences is estimated at  12,000, and of the gun defences at  14,700 total,  26,700.If storage at Malta is approved, the cost of maintenance should be negligible.(D.) Acquisition of Land.Steps should be taken immediately to make a reconnaissance at Haifa with a view to selecting and earmarking the land required for the defences, and the site for the aerodrome and seaplane base. The assistance of the Air Council has been offered in the carrying out of this survey.&quot;We concur generally in the above recommendations, but we feel some doubt as to whether the provision of one battery of 2 6-inch guns at Haifa instead of two batteries may not suffice in view of the proximity of powerful air forces. We recommend that the final decision on this point should be reviewed when the question of their provision arises, which is not likely to occur until after the decision to build the railway and pipeline has been taken.The Defence of the Railway and Pipeline.7. We attach in Annexure II a detailed report on the defence of the Haifa-Baghdad pipeline and railway, a summary of conclusions of which is as follows: &quot; It will be noted that the defence of an oil pipeline on a Baghdad-Haifa alignment entails no military commitment to Britain in any hostilities except those with Arab tribes or France.Should hostilities with Arab Tribes materialise to such an extent as to require the introduction of an organised system of defence, the commitment would not exceed 2 battalions and 8 sections of armoured cars if all the posts were manned. In the case of war with France, however, the defence of the pipeline will entail the presence of Imperial forces at Haifa prior to the outbreak of war amounting to an infantry brigade with a proportion of other arms and aircraft, and the organisation of defences at pumping stations garrisoned by additional troops amounting to 2 battalions and 40 guns.   .There are no flying facilities at Haifa at present, and the provision of an aerodrome and seaplane station there is necessary.&quot;Summary of Conclusions.8.   Our conclusions may be summarised as follows :  (a.) Strategical Considerations.The proposed scheme for a pipeline and railway from Baghdad to Haifa is of the greatest strategical importance in connection with the supply of oil fuel to the Navy at home, in the Mediterranean and on the route to the Far East, and in addition should greatly strengthen the whole of our defensive organisa-tion in the Near East by facilitating the transport of men and munitions to Iraq for the defence of our interests in those regions.[17756] e 2
(b.) Defence of Haifa.The recommendations of the Oversea Defence Committee, as summarised in paragraph 6, should be approved subject to their re-examination before action is taken to give effect to them, more particularly in regard to the number of guns to be provided at Haifa itself.(c) Defence of the Railway and Pipeline.Approval should be given to the report of the Committee attached in Annexure II, the recommendations of which are summarised above in para-graph 7, and envisage the following commitments: (i.)

245Annexure I to Appendix 2.DEFENCE OF THE PORT OF HAIFA.[Paper No. O.D.G. 546-M.]Memorandum by the Oversea Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence.Terms of Reference.1. AT the request of the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee the Oversea Defence Committee have been asked &quot; To report on the nature of the defences which would be necessary to secure the port of Haifa, with its oil-fuel resources and facilities, against seaward attack by a naval Mediterranean Power, and that- -(i) the capital cost of such defences, and(li) the annual charge for their upkeep and maintenance in time of peace should be stated.The above considerations to be based upon the assumption that Haifa was, in the matter of urgency, to be classified as a &quot; C &quot; port (Appendix I to J.D.C., No. 69), but an indication should be given as to what steps should be taken now to enable the defences to be installed with the minimum of cost.&quot;Probable Scale of Naval Attack.2. The probable scale of attack to be anticipated in the event of war with &amp; Mediterranean naval Power is agreed to be as follows : (i.) Bombardment raid by cruiser.(ii.) Attack by armed merchant vessels, either by gunfire or minelaying. (iii.) Attack by submarines, either by gunfire, or by mine or torpedo on shipping in the harbour and approaches.Bombardment raid by cruisers has been included owing to the great importance which the projected oil-fuel resources and facilities would give to Haifa, and, in the ordinary course of events, the shore defences to meet this form of attack should include 9-2-inch guns. In view, however, of the great risk of interception by units of our Fleet which an attacking vessel would incur, it is agreed that, in this particular case, 6-inch guns can be regarded as a sufficient deterrent.It has also been pointed out to the Committee that flying boats may in th6 future be stationed in the Eastern Mediterranean, and that the fear of interception by such craft armed with torpedoes might be an additional deterrent to attack on Haifa from the sea.Probable Scale of Seaborne Air Attack.3. The probable scale of seaborne air attack is considered to be as follows 3 Light, occasional attacks by aircraft carried in a cruiser, armed merchant vessel, or submarine, and air spotting for naval bombardment.
It is considered, however, in view of the preceding paragraph, that attack by aircraft carried in a cruiser is unlikely.4. In laying down the above scales of attack, the Oversea Defence Committee fully appreciate that, if France were the enemy, land attack from Syria, or shore-based air attack from the same direction, would be far more likely to be attempted, and would probably offer more chance of success than sporadic attacks from the sea!Local Naval Defences.5. ^ The Bay of Acre. is favourable to submarine and minelaying operations. Provision is therefore considered necessary against (a.) Minelaying in the approaches to the port, and (&amp;.) Attack by torpedo on shipping in the harbour.To deal with (a) a small force of minesweeping vessels would be required to keep open the approaches to the port. Two auxiliary minesweepers could keep open a channel 8 miles long and 2 miles wide, that is, from the harbour to the 100-fathom line.As regards (&amp;), the width of the proposed harbour entrance is not yet accurately known, but the Committee have been given an indication of the probable plans, from which it seems possible that an anti-torpedo net baffle, 60 per cent, efficient, extending 120 degrees for 2 cables from the proposed north-east arm of the harbour, would afford protection to vessels in the harbour from torpedo attack. The cost of this would be approximately  12,000.As an alternative to this, an indicator loop system of defence would involve roughly 8 miles of three-legged loops and 9 miles of tail cable. The approximate cost of this would be  11,000, not including the cost of the control station or instruments, which would be about  1,000.A force of 4 anti-submarine vessels would be necessary to deal with the submarines detected by the loops. Until, however, the exact design of the new harbour is known a definite recommendation as to the type of anti-submarine defences cannot be made.-Examination Anchorage.&apos;      6.   The following site is suggested by the Admiralty : Bounded on the west by a line running from a point A 2 cables 48&quot; from lias El Krum Point 14&quot; for 10 cables to a point B; on the north by a line running from B 104o for 10 cables to a point C; on the east by a line running from C 1940 for 10 cables to a point D; on the south by a line joining A and D.This anchorage would be exposed to submarine attack and also to northerly winds, but the Committee do not recommend any protection other than that which can be afforded by the anti-submarine vessels.Gun Defences.7. Owing to the large area of water from which bombarding vessels could operate, the Committee consider that two batteries each of two 6-inch guns would be required at Cape Carrnel. One of these batteries would be required to perform the duties of Examination Battery, and would have to be furnished with 2 defence electric lights for this purpose.8. The question of the defence of Haifa against land attack, and against shore-based air attack, has not been referred to the Oversea Defence Committee, but it would appear that conditions might be such that the landward defence of Haifa would involve the presence of a garrison at Acre. This garrison would be liable to attack by gunfire from the sea from outside the range of the guns at Haifa, and for its protection against this form of attack the installation of 2 6-inch guns at Acre is considered necessary.9. In making the above recommendations the Committee have assumed that hitherto existing methods of coast defence would be adhered to. It has, however, been pointed out to them by the Air Staff that the port of Haifa is particularly well situated as regards the employment of air power for its defence. Normal centres of air power exist in peace time in Egypt, Palestine, and Iraq, and an organized air
route passes close to Haifa, which could be reached by air in one day from all these centres. In the Haifa Port development scheme a proposal has been put forward to construct a civil aerodrome, and the Air Ministry have suggested that a seaplane site should be selected in conjunction with this aerodrome.10. The Committee assume that the proposals of the Joint Planning Committee in regard to the landward defence of Haifa, and the defence of the pipe line, will include the concentration of aircraft at or near Haifa. The presence of such aircraft would undoubtedly strengthen the scale of defences proposed above against seaward attack, but the Committee are not in a position to estimate whether it would allow a reduction of the gun defences. They venture to point out, however, that, in any case, a battery of 2 6-inch guns and 2 lights would be required in connection with the Examination Service.Peace Time Arrangements.Local Naval Defences.11. The Committee suggest that the material for the local naval defences should be stored at Malta. The maintenance of this should involve no appreciable addition to existing naval expenditure.Gun Defences.12. The Committee recommend that 6 6-inch gun equipments and 2 lights, together with 6 Arrol mountings, and 500 rounds of ammunition per gun, should be stored at&apos; Malta ready for installation at Haifa and Acre immediately war breaks out.13. The cost of the gun defences has been calculated on the assumption that 6 6-inch gun equipments would be available from spares at home.* Apart from the cost of rectifying the 6 gun equipments at  100 each, there would be no charge under this heading. The Committee suggest that Arrol mountings should be used for these guns.   The cost of 6 of these mountings is estimated at  1,800.The cost of rectifying 3,000 rounds of ammunition would amount to  6,000, and the cost of instruments would be approximately  2,100.The total cost of the proposed armament may, therefore, be assumed to be  10,500, excluding the cost of sites.14. Two 90-centimetre lights will be available from the surplus at Malta when the review of the defences there has been completed. As there is a number of semi-portable generative sets available in store at Woolwich, the only cash expenditure necessary in connection with the lights would be as follows :  Reconditioning the defence electric lights and plant    ... 100CablesPreparation of sites for lights and guns Battery Commander&apos;s post, &amp;c. Telephones and communications300 800 500 2,500Total   ... ... ... ... ...      4,20015. The total cost involved in the preparation of the necessary guns and lights may, therefore, be assumed to be  14,700.No allowance has been made in this estimate for (a.) Accommodation for R.A. and R.E. personnel. (&amp;.) Magazine accommodation for ammunition, (c.) Storage of instruments, spare parts, &amp;c. (d.) Sites.The cost of maintenance of the above material at Malta should be negligible.Royal Artillery and Royal Engineer Garrison.16. Since it would be of the utmost importance to install the defences at Haifa at the earliest possible moment after the outbreak of war, the Oversea Defence Committee suggest that the necessary personnel should be taken from the Malta garrison, the latter being made up to strength as soon as reinforcements can arrive* The value of a 6-inch gun, with mounting, is approximately  4,000. Since, however, a large number of surplus guns of this nature is in stock, and it would not be possible to obtain more than their scrap value if they were disposed of, the capital cost is not taken into account.
from home. Although the coast defence garrison at Malta, being on a 50 per cent, basis, would be seriously depleted by this arrangement, the Committee suggest that the presence of the Fleet would render attack on Malta at this stage unlikely, whereas delay in providing a garrison for Haifa might result in the destruction of the oil-fuel installation, &amp;c.Purchase of Land at Haifa.17.   It is estimated that the following sites would be required at Haifa:  Three areas of 100 yards by 50 yards on Mount Carmel for the 2 6-inch batteriesand the 2 Defence Electric lights. An aerodrome with a minimum area of 1,000 yards by 800 yards; if possible with a sea frontage which could be adapted for use as a base for flying boats.So far as can be judged from the map, the aerodrome would have to be situated to the North-East of Haifa town.At Acre an area of 100 yards by 50 yards for the battery of 2 6-inch guns would be required.18. The Committee have been unable to obtain any useful estimate of the probable cost of these sites, but they venture to point out that when the projected development of the port of Haifa is begun the cost of land will undoubtedly appreciate. They therefore suggest that, if the pipe-line is decided upon, immediate steps should be taken to arrange for a reconnaissance at Haifa with a view to selecting and acquiring the necessary land.Summary of Conclusions.(A.) Naval and Military Defences.19. To secure the port of Haifa against attack by a European Naval Power, the Oversea Defence Committee consider that the following would be necessary: Local Naval Defences. -An anti-torpedo baffle net, or, alternatively, an indicator loop system, either of which is estimated to cost approximately  12,000. (This figure will require revision when the plans for the proposed harbour at Haifa are definitely approved.) Two auxiliary minesweepers and 4 anti-submarine vessels would also be required.Gun Defences. At Haifa, two batteries of 2 6-inch guns each and 2 lights. Also one battery of 2 6-inch guns at Acre, if the latter place is garrisoned.These defences are recommended on the assumption that hitherto existing methods of coast defence are adhered to.(B.) Peace-time Arrangements.It is proposed that the material for the above defences should be stored at Malta. Also that the necessary personnel for the guns and lights should be furnished by the Malta garrison, the latter being reinforced from home as soon as possible.(C.)-Cost.The capital cost of the Local Naval Defences is estimated at  12,000,* and of the gun defences at  14,700-Total  26,700.If storage at Malta is approved, the cost of maintenance should be negligible.(D.) Acquisition of Land.Steps should be taken immediately to make a reconnaissance at Haifa with a view to selecting and earmarking the land required for the defences, and the site for the aerodrome and seaplane base. The assistance of the Air Council has been offered in the carrying out of this survey.(Signed) G. N. MACREADY,Secretary, Oversea Defence Committee.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1, May 14, 1928.* This figure will require revision when final plans for the proposed harbour at Haifa are available.

DEFENCE OF THE HAIFA-BAGHDAD PIPELINE.Introduction.1. We were instructed by the Chiefs of Staff Committee to report, firstly, what nature of protection would be necessary to provide for the Haifa-Baghdad pipeline, whether in peace, or in the event of Great Britain being involved in a war on the alternative assumptions that France were (i) Neutral, (ii) Hostile, and that the maximum scale of attack should be with France hostile but unable to send reinforce-ments to Syria. Secondly, to report what effect the construction of a railway alongside the pipeline would have on the defence of the pipeline.2. As the termination of the pipeline is in Haifa, we have assumed our terms of reference include the defence of Haifa itself against all attacks other than seaborne.General Review of Situation.Route of Pipeline.3. The alignment is expected to follow the route Haifa-Beisan (on the Palestine-Transjordan border)-Zerka-Azrak-Rutbah-Kubaisah-Hit or Ramadi Oilfields.4. The total distance will be approximately 720 miles; 100 miles in Palestine and Transjordan proper, 200 miles in the settled districts of Iraq, and 420 miles of desert inhabited by loosely administered tribes. Of this desert tract, 150 miles is within the Transjordan boundary and the remainder is under the sovereignty of Iraq.5. Between Zerka and Rutbah the distance from the pipeline to the Syrian frontier varies from a minimum of 25 to a maximum of 60 miles. Damascus, well inside the Syrian border, is itself less than 100 miles from Zerka.General Description of the Country to be Traversed by the Pipeline.6. The country to the north and south of this alignment is passable for wheels from Haifa to within a few miles of the Palestine-Transjordan border. From Beisan, on the border, to Azrak the route passes first through a tangled mass of hills and thereafter through stony desert interspersed with rocky outcrops; there are definite tracks passable for vehicles, but, generally speaking, the country is unfit for wheeled traffic. Eastwards of Azrak, although numerous obstacles are encountered in the form of rocky outcrops, sandy patches and Wadis, the country generally would admit of the free passage of wheels, especially vehicles on 6-wheeled chassis. The whole of this area is particularly suited to air operations.The Pipeline.7. The Pipeline will, at the initial stages, consist of two pipes of 12-inch diameter. The pipes will not be buried. Pumping stations with oil tanks will be situated every 30-40 miles along the routes. Adequate water supplies would be essential for stations. This might either be provided by a water pipeline or by the boring of wells. The water pipeline would be vulnerable to attack, and adequate reserves of water would be needed at the stations to meet such an eventuality.Vulnerability of the Pipeline.8. Damage to the pipeline can easily be repaired. Extensive damage to a pumping station would stop the flow of oil through the pipeline for a long time.The oil installations at Haifa and the pumping and boosting stations throughout the line would be very vulnerable to air attack.[17756]
Local Tribes.9. From Transjordania to the Euphrates the projected alignment traverses the areas inhabited by the Beni Sakr tribes and certain tribes of the Anizeh confederacy, notably the Ruwalla and the Amarat, and finally the territory of the more settled Dulaim tribe. While the attitude of the Ruwalla is uncertain, the remainder of the above tribes are definitely friendly. Indeed, the Amarat, an important and powerful desert tribe, is paid a substantial subsidy to safeguard the trans-desert air and motor routes. Provided that these tribes did not react to Wahabi influence, there is no reason to suppose that their attitude towards us will change.Water.10. The migration of tribes furnishes evidence that perennial water and grazing is practically non-existent in the desert region. There is ample water at Azrak and the wells are plentiful around Rutbah and Kubaisah. Though detailed survey may disclose the presence of perennial water elsewhere along the projected route, it seems probable that the water requirements of the various pumping and boosting stations will have to be supplied by means of a pipeline.To the South and South-East of Damascus, numerous water wells are to be found right up to the Transjordan frontier.The Attitude of the, Tribes.11. The attitude of the tribes on the route to be taken by the proposed pipeline is shown by the fact that the trans-desert motor transport and aircraft services which follow approximately this route have not been seriously interfered with by them.12. Indeed, the fact that British aircraft flying between Baghdad and Palestine will be passing continually over the route of the proposed pipeline will serve as a constant reminder that British air power is readily available should the need for its exertion arise, and will be a potent factor in the maintenance of order and the protec-tion of the pipeline against any attempt on the part of the tribesmen through whose territory it passes. At the same time, the increased opportunities of lucrative employment which the line should offer would serve as an incentive to these tribesmen to assist in maintaining its integrity against possible attempts by intruders from a distance.13. At the present time the Iraq Government is able to maintain order and arrange for the collection of taxes in this area by granting a monthly subsidy of normally 3,000 Rs. to the paramount Sheikh Mahrut-Beg-Ibn-Hadhal. (Temporarily, to meet the Wahabi menace, this subsidy has been increased to 12,000 Rs. p.m.)14. In this connection it is noteworthy that the Anglo-Persian Oil Company in South Persia have obtained absolute security for its pipelines for many years past, without the use of a single gendarme, by the following means : (a.) The grant of a royalty of 16 per cent, of the Company&apos;s gross profits to thePersian Government. (&amp;.) The gift of small subsidies to the neighbouring tribes.15. Minor but unorganised raids by Arab tribesmen, with or without the connivance of Ibn Saud, are always possible, but could be countered with the assistance of the subsidised tribes and by air action from normal peace bases in Iraq and Transjordan in the same way as similar raids on the Iraq frontier. The Iraq Government, moreover, would be directly interested in the integrity of the pipeline, which would pay them royalty and which lies for two-thirds of its length in Iraq territory. These considerations should afford a reasonable assurance of freedom from interference.Conclusion.16. (a.) The Committee considers that the following measures should suffice for the protection of the pipeline in peace time : &apos;(i.) Grant of small subsidies to the Sheikhs through whose territory the pipeline passes.
(ii.) A daily patrol of the route by staff in the employ of the oil companies or the subsidised Sheikhs.(iii.) The construction of some form of defence around each Pumping Station with such an entrance as will enable aircraft to be taken within the defences, and that adequate water tank storage should be provided at each station. Landing grounds adjoining each station should be marked out.(iv.) Should conditions require it the formation of a small gendarmerie for service at the pumping stations, (v.) Before the outbreak of hostilities the installation of a small aviation petrol and oil reserve at each pumping station and a stock of sandbags for protection against sniping.(&amp;.) The Committee recommends that the above measures should be the responsi-bility of the oil companies in peace time as in the case of the South Persian oilfields.(c.) Should raids be made by Arab tribes the Air Force in Iraq or in Trans-jordania could be called upon to punish the raiders.Protection of the Pipeline when Britain is at War and France, is Neutral.17. We have assumed for the purposes of this paper that, in the event of war between Great Britain and countries in close proximity to the pipeline, the neutralisa-tion of the enemy&apos;s main forces form part of the main plan of campaign, and that we are only required to consider such attacks as may be delivered either before the main concentration can take place or can be carried out by detachments from the main forces after this concentration has been effected.18. To meet such attack as may be expected in a war with any nation, except those mentioned below, we consider the defence provisions during peace time would be adequate.War with Turkey.19. In the event of war with Turkey, France being neutral, the oilfields and pipeline will be covered by French territory and Iraq or Imperial Forces in northern Iraq against attack by either land or air forces from Turkey. Further, the Turkish forces would have to cross 300 miles of desert to attack the pipeline.It is not considered, therefore, that the scale of attack on the pipeline would exceed sabotage, for which the peace defence organisations already described in para. 16 would suffice.20. Turkey possesses some flying boats (only two at present). These boats might be sent to Mersina for operations against Haifa. This form of attack could best be countered by a seaborne attack on the flying boats immediately on the outbreak of war.Hostilities with Arab Tribes.21. In the event of hostilities with Arab Tribes it is estimated that the scald of attack would not exceed raids by tribal forces of a maximum strength of 2,000-3,000 men in any one place.22. In the unlikely contingency of hostilities with Arab tribes developing to such an extent as to make it necessary to institute an organised defensive system of the pipeline, the following additional defence measures may have to be introduced: (a.) The grant of small additional subsidies temporarily to the Sheikhs, through whose territory the pipeline passes, to enable them to raise camel corps for the patrol and protection of the pipeline, and the secondment of British officers for duty with these corps.(b.) An Intelligence Service amongst the tribes in the vicinity of the pipeline should be inaugurated, so that warning may be received of impending-attacks.(c.) Wireless communication would be required at the pumping stations.
(d.) The provision of small garrisons of Imperial troops at the pumping stations, together with small reserves of armoured cars suitably placed. For this purpose a total of 2 battalions and 8 armoured-car sections would be required, if provision has to be made to garrison the stations throughout the length of the pipeline. The source from which these troops could be obtained would have to be settled in accordance with the military situation existing at the time, possibly from Malta once the Mediterranean reserve is reconstituted.(e.) Action by aircraft against the tribes concerned for which ample air forces are already available.Note. In view of the importance to Iraq that the export of oil from Iraq should not be interfered with, it is reasonable to expect that Iraq forces will be made available to assist in (d) above within the boundaries of Iraq.Situation : France Hostile.Review : Comparison of Forces. (For detailed comparison see Appendix A.)France.23. In view of the unsettled conditions which prevail in Syria, it may be assumed that at the present moment the maximum force France could make available for operations against British interests would be 6 regular battalions.6 regular cavalry squadrons.5 field batteries.4 A.C. squadrons.2 tank companies.A proportion of 4 Syrian cavalry squadrons. 20 irregular squadrons.&apos; These squadrons have a proportion of touring cars fitted with machine guns. 8 air squadrons = (64 aeroplanes).24. There does not appear to be any immediate prospect of more settled conditions obtaining in Syria, but should these conditions improve it is understood to be the policy of the French Government to reduce the garrison.25. Should strained relations between France and Britain develop it is considered unlikely that France would materially increase her forces in Syria, though she may well build up an adequate reserve of war material, of which she is at present short particularly as regards aircraft. After the outbreak of hostilities it can be accepted no reinforcements of any kind could be sent to Syria (vide Terms of Reference).26. It seems, therefore, that it can be assumed the forces which France could send against Palestine would at no time be more formidable, from the point of view of either number or character, than those indicated in paragraph 23 above.Britain: Military Forces.27. In Appendix (A) will be found a note on the Military Forces in the Middle East. It will be observed that in the peace garrisons there are no troops which can be counted on as available to resist French aggression into Palestine.28. In view of the importance to Iraq of the uninterrupted flow of oil through the oil pipeline (Iraq will receive 4s. a ton in royalties), it may be expected that the Iraq Government would do its best to protect an interest so important to her. In view, however, of the other problems of defence with which Iraq will be faced, it is not considered to be safe to rely upon a greater scale of assistance than that against sabotage within the settled portions of her Iraq territory.
The extent of assistance given by Iraq would decide the size of the force which would have to be obtained from Imperial Reserves.29. After the outbreak of war it will not be possible for the Trench to reinforce their Syrian garrison, whereas (a.) British forces can expect casualties to be replaced.(b.) Once the Mediterranean Reserve has been reconstituted reinforcements from this source could reach Haifa in 4 days, provided they were not required elsewhere.(c.) In addition to the Air Forces available in the Middle East, aircraft not required for operations with the Fleet will be available.It will thus be seen that any failure in the initial French operations against Haifa will automatically reduce their chances of future success. The strength of the attack is bound to decrease, whilst the losses of British troops in the defence can be replaced and reinforcements can be expected.Routes from Syria into Palestine.30. (a.) By rail: (i) Damascus-Yarmuk Valley-Beisan*-Haifa. (ii) Yarmuk Valley-Samra.*(p.) By road: (i) Damascus-Lake Tiberias-Nazareth-Haifa. (ii) Tripoli-Beyrut-Acre-Haifa. (Coastal Route.) (iii) Deraa-Zerka-thence pipeline route to Haifa. Route (ii) is so open to complete severance by attack from the sea that its use by the French is improbable. Route (i) is therefore the only one which can be expected to be used by considerable forces of the enemy in an offensive against Palestine.There are, however, numberless trans-desert routes by which irregular light forces, supported by machine guns in cross country M.T. vehicles, could carry out raids on the pipeline; for this purpose the French forces in Syria are admirably constituted.Courses of Action open to France.31.   The following courses of action are open to France :  (a.) An operation against Haifa. This may either take the form of (i) a raid, delivered shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, by mobile forces supported by such infantry units and/or air forces as can be made available, with the object of damaging the oil installations and harbour works at Haifa; or (ii) it may take the form of a deliberate operation, with all available forces, against Haifa with a view to the occupation of the port. It is considered that this latter operation might be commenced 7 days from the outbreak of war.(&amp;.) Raids on the pipeline. These may vary from a major operation, such as the temporary occupation by troops of all arms and complete destruction of stations near the frontier, such as Beisan, to raids by mobile land and /or air forces against desert posts.(c.) An advance into Iraq with a view to capturing and destroying the oil wells. The weakness of the Iraq Army, and the time it would take for our reinforcements (except aircraft) to reach Iraq, might appear to make this a tempting operation. It is, however, considered that the very great difficulties of supply, and the small number of troops available for L. of C. defence, would preclude the French from embarking on so formidable an undertaking.32. Of the above courses of action (31 (a) (i)), a raid on Haifa shortly after the outbreak of war, delivered by mobile forces with the object of damaging the oil installations, is considered the course most likely to be adopted. With it, raids by mobile land and/or air forces on the pipeline may be combined.* Note. The pipeline crosses the railways at these places.
British Courses of Action.33.   The following measures may be taken  (a.) The concentration of all available aircraft within striking distance of Syria with a view to preventing the concentration and movement of the French Forces. For this purpose the provision in peace of an aerodrome and seaplane station at Haifa is necessary.Note. There is a total strength of 11 British squadrons (128 aircraft) in the Middle East from which to draw these reinforcements, as against a total of 8 French squadrons (64 aircraft). The number of British air units which could be concentrated would be dependent upon the situation obtaining in Egypt, Palestine and Iraq. Further, a valuable reinforcement would be available from aircraft surplus to fleet requirements.(&amp;.) Action by naval forces, including feints of landings against Tripoli, Beirut and Alexandretta, interference with the coast route to Acre by the destruction of bridges and bombardment of troops.(c.) Propaganda throughout Syria.34. In view of the nature of the available routes, it is considered that a major operation by the French against Haifa with considerable infantry forces could be prevented by the adoption of the measures indicated above and the provision of the forces enumerated below. But, in view of the fact that Haifa will be, as has already been pointed out, an objective of the first importance to the French, and that the measures outlined above cannot be fully effective during the first two or three days of war, it is considered that the French will not be deterred from carrying out an early dash with mobile forces against Haifa.35. The only method of preventing French mobile forces from entering Haifa immediately after the outbreak of war will be to station Imperial Troops in that place before the war begins. The following forces are considered to be necessary for the purpose : 1 regiment of cavalry.1 brigade of infantry.1 brigade of field artillery.1 light battery.4 A.C. sections.1 coy. tanks.In addition, for anti-aircraft defence, additional to air forces 1 A.A. battery and 2 E.L. sections (12 lights) would be required.36. Raids on the pipeline by mobile forces, including tanks, cannot be prevented without locking up a prohibitive number of troops.By the provision of comparatively small concrete, wire and anti-tank mine defences at each post, a considerable measure of protection could, however, be obtained wuth a force of 7 batteries of field artillery (or anti-tank weapons, if available). 2 battalions of infantry.Air bombing of pipeline posts can only be prevented by the action of our air forces.37. Should the unlikely contingency of a French advance on Mosul materialise, the major part of Iraq&apos;s small army would inevitably be drawn to that area. It is not therefore considered safe to rely on a greater scale of assistance from Iraq than that which will prevent sabotage within the settled portions of her country.
Conclusions.38. (1.)-Haifa, with its oil storage, refinery and loading installations, its docks and raihyay terminus, will offer an objective of such importance to the French that it is considered that an advance against Haifa itself will be the most likely course for the French to adopt, and that they will be prepared to accept considerable risks to reach their objective.This advance may take the form of an immediate attack on the outbreak of war by mobile forces, with a view to subsequent withdrawal if necessary, or a deliberate operation by all available forces at a later date, with a view to the occupation of Haifa. The French having considerable mobile forces of regular cavalry, tanks and armoured cars, a dash on Haifa, shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, together with raids on the pipeline, are considered the most likely courses to be adopted by the French.(2.) In order to counter the operations against Haifa, it is considered that (a.) The following provision should be made before the outbreak of war : (i.) To prevent an immediate attack on Haifa, a garrison of the estimated strength of: 1 regiment of cavalry.1 brigade of infantry.1 brigade of field artillery.1 light battery.1 field coy., R.E.4 A.C. sections.1 coy. tanks.1 A.A. battery.2 E.L. sections (12 lights).(ii.) Concentration of all available air units within striking distance of Syria. For this purpose an aerodrome and sea-plane station at Haifa are required, (iii.) For raids on the. pipeline by mobile forces the following would be needed, in addition to the British Air Forces in the Middle East: 40 field guns (or anti-tank weapons, if available). 2 battalions of infantry.(iv.) If possible, an aircraft carrier to proceed to Haifa to land air reinforcements.(&amp;.) The following measures should be taken on the outbreak of war : (i.) An air offensive directed against suitable objectives, with a view to preventing the movement of the French forces.(ii.) Co-operation by the navy by making feint landings against the Syrian coast, destroying the bridges on the coast road from Beirut to Acre and preventing movement of troops along this road.(iii.) Propaganda throughout Syria, and particularly amongst the Druzes and other tribes, with a view to causing unrest and revolt.(3.) Should the French decide to undertake a deliberate operation for the capture of Haifa, that, having regard to the nature of the routes of approach, the measures and provisions enumerated above will provide a reasonable margin of safety-pending the arrival of reinforcements.The Value of a Railway contiguous to the Pipeline.39. The problem of the defence of the pipeline would be facilitated to a very marked degree if a contiguous railway were in existence. The advantages from the point of view of defence can be summarised as follows : (a.) The railway would promote the development and pacification of the country.   Hence, instances of tribal sabotage should be fewer.(6.) The transportation and maintenance of the garrisons of defended posts would be simplified; also, the supply of petrol and other requisites of aircraft.[17756]G
(c.) Armoured trains and motor trolleys, fitted with machine guns, could be usedto patrol the pipeline. (d.) The movement of reserves and reinforcements, should they be available,would be made possible over the route from Baghdad to Palestine, with a saving of approximately 6 days on the passage of troops from India to palestine via, Suez.On the other hand, attacks on the railway must be anticipated in a war with France, though, in view of the more advantageous target presented by Haifa, no more than temporary interference need be expected.40. It will be noted that the defence of an oil pipeline on a Baghdad-Haifa alignment entails no military commitment to Britain in any hostilities except those with Arab tribes or France.Should hostilities with Arab Tribes materialise to such an extent as to require the introduction of an organised system of defence, the commitment would not exceed 2 battalions and 8 sections of armoured cars if all the posts were manned. In the case of war with France, however, the defence of the pipeline will entail the presence of Imperial forces at Haifa prior to the outbreak of war amounting to a Brigade with a proportion of other arms and aircraft, and the organisation of defences at pumping stations garrisoned by additional troops amounting to 2 battalions and 40 guns.41. There are no flying facilities at Haifa at present, and the provision of an aerodrome and seaplane station there is necessary.42. The existence of the railway alongside the oil pipeline is of the greatest importance to the defence of the pipeline and to enable repairs to be effected in as short a time as possible.Summary of Conclusions.(Signed)ROGER M.

APPENDIX (A) TO ANNEXURE II.Comparison op Forces :  France Hostile. France.. French Forces.In Syria 12 regular battalions.8 Syrian levy battalions.8 regular cavalry squadrons.4 Syrian levy squadrons. 20 squadrons of irregulars.7 batteries.4 armoured car squadrons.2 tank companies.2 camel companies.8 air squadrons (64 aeroplanes).Britain.Military Forces. In Palestine 4 companies Trans-Jordan F.F. fully employed on internal security duties.In Iraq Imperial Troops 1 Indian infantry battalion. 1 field company, S. and M. Wireless section.Iraq Army 7 infantry battalions (including exemplar battalion).3 cavalry regiments.2 field artillery batteries.3 pack artillery batteries.Iraq Levies 2 (Assyrian) battalions. 1 M.G. company.   ,It is apparent that little assistance could be expected from the Iraq Army and Levies in the defence of the pipeline, and in no case could they be expected to assist in operations in Palestine or Transjordan.In Egypt The Imperial Troops in Egypt consist of 3 cavalry regiments.6 infantry battalions.3 light batteries.3 horse artillery batteries.1 section tanks.1 A.C. company.1 field company, R.E.In view of the fact that the event of war with France, the situation in Egypt would certainly be disturbed, it is improbable that any of these troops would be available for operations in Palestine.
3. Air Forces.In Iraq 1 squadron army co-operation. 3 squadron single engine bombers. 1 squadron troop carriers or bombers. 7 sections of armoured cars.In Palestine and Transjordania 1 squadron single-engine bombers. 1 armoured Car Co., at Ramleh.In Egypt 1 squadron single-engine bombers.1 squadron army co-operation.1 squadron troop carriers or bombers.In Soudan 1 squadron single-engine bombers.In Aden 1 squadron single-engine bombers.Total : 11 squadrons (128 first-line aeroplanes).There are Air Bases at Mosul, Baghdad, Basra, Ramleh, Amman, Ismaideh and Cairo and numerous landing grounds; and an organised air route exists between Baghdad and the Sudan via Cairo and Palestine.o
