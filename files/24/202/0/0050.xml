*5a,) &amp; OSLUMS.1. Perhaps the outstanding feature of ths sLumproblem at the end of the war was the gross oY&amp;rvxxr&amp;&amp;ijxig which erigted and undoubtedly until this feature had been mitigated it was impossible seriously to deal with tho matter, Although it is repeatedly stated by political opponants that the new housing which has been carried out since then has in no way touched the slum problem, it is obvious that this statement will not bear examination.    Taking the number of new houses required annually to provide for the increase of the population and for the replacement of houses passiing out of habitation at 100,000, a number which is probably considerably too high, the last four years alone would have provided a surplus of 400*000 houses which may be taken as sufficient aoooomodation for one million six hundred thousand persons at least.   In fact observers are aware that in all large towns there are to-day to be found many occupants of old houses who have recently moved Into them on the migration of the previous inhabitants to new houses built in the suburbs, and there is no doubt that, so far as overorowding is concerned, the position has materially improved and that the time has oome whan the slum problem itself can be effectively tackled. 2, Before considering v/hat form any new policy shouldtake it may be useful to exa: lne the methods which hava hitherto bean adopted and the roeults that have followed therefrom,   Tha x^rooess of slum clearance can be said to date from ifaa passing of tho Artisans and Labourers Dwellings
FT 9 1 t.J w fi wellinga Improvement Act of 1875.    The fir at scheme which was oarrled through under that Act was one initiated by Mr. Joseph Chamberlain in Birmingham.   Progress was not very rapid.    In between 1875 and 1890 only 36 schemes ware confirmed by the Local Government Board and the total number of persons affected was not more than about 58,000.    The reason given for this lack of progress was that the method of compensation adopted was too favourable to the slum owners.    It was found that in many oases these owners obtained for bad properties compensation equal to that which others wore reoeiving for properties to which no exoeptlon could be taken.    Accordingly the basis of compensation was amended by various Acts between 1875 and 1890, the prinoipls finally emerging boing that compensation should be determined on the basis of fair market value, subjeot to abatement whore the rental was enhanced by the overcrowding of the house or where the hcuso was unfit for habitation or not in reasonably good ropair.    The various Acts were consolidated by the Housing Aot, 1890.3. Up to the commencement of the war this Act haldthe field but still very little progress was made.    The total number of schemes approved between 1891 and 1915 was only 73 and again only 50,000 persons ware affected.    Once again it was found that the terras of compensation proved so costly to the Local Authority and, moreover, tha prooadura was so desperately Slow that the Authorities themselves undertook such son ems a with reluctance and wore careful to limit the areas which they were prepared to make the subject of their soheraes.
4. During the war years slum clearance was naturally at a complete standstill and it was not until 1919 that under tho Coalition Government a new attempt was made to deal with the difficulties that had &quot;bean experienced, and to gat the work of slum clearance under way.   Por the first time a distinction was made between properties Included on account of their sanitary condition or because dangerous or injurious to health and properties inoluded for the purpose of efficiency.    In the cage ox the first olass, site value only was to he paid;    in the case of the second, properties ware to be taken at market value.   A further condition was introduced namely, that where the cleared area was to be used for re-housing or open spaces the full site value was to be reduced to the value for the purpose for whioh it was to be used.5. Under the post-war conditions little activitycould be undartaJien in connection with slum clearanoe and in 1980 Dr. Addison appointed an Unhealthy Areas Committee of which the present Minister of Health was Chairman.    This Committee severely criticised tho provisions of Section 9 of the 1919 Act which dealt with compensation, pointing...out--that it was likely to lead to inequality and injustice -as between individuals and that these circumstances might indeed tend to deter local authorities from making use of the section.
ro /*d h ii6. It must be admitted tiLat&quot;th.es-e-^jriti^cdJEraas have proved to be well founded.    In spite of &quot;the more favourable ocnditions prevailing and the publio attention which has.been, focussed upon the problem, only 85 Authorities have produced 118 schemes dealing with 75,000 persons during the 10 years since 1919, and only 30 of these schemes have bean completed. Moreover a serious agitation has arisen over the grievances of property ownars who had bean affected by the schemes adopted and there is a certain amount of evidence to the affect that the sanse of these grievances has actually caused local authorities to hold their hands and to ignore tha powers given them under this Act.   Under the Housing Consolidation Aot of 1925 seotion 9 was re-enacted as section 46 and it was hopad that the Act might ba followed by an ^mending Bill. Time, however, has proved to be wanting and the proparty owners are still without any reiae&amp;y for their. grievances.7. Reviewing tha brief history of slum clearancewhich has been given, it must be admitted that up to the present all th3 various Acts of 12ie legislature have been comparatively speaking a failure.    The number of parsons dealt with has bean trifling and there is no indication that even though the problem of overcrowding ba completely solved, there is any likelihood that tha slum problem will ba brotight within control in any reasonable period.    Generally speaking it may be said that tha failure is due, firstly, to the cost imposed on local authorities; secondly, to tha length of time occupied in tha completion of Hi a scheme; and thirdly, to the unfairness
of the present methods of compensation.      It must be added that the process of slum clearance being necessarily slow, tedious and costly, and presenting, when completed, no very striking or attractive picture, is in the nature of things not likely ever to be very popular among Local Authorities.8. Nevertheless, It Is considered that some further effort must be made to expedite the process and it is suggested that this should take the form of1.       Some Increase in the Exchequer contribution; 2.      A speeding up of the procedure with perhaps additional powers to the Minister to put pressure on Local Authorities;    and 3*       A recasting of the method of compensation.9, So far as (1) is concerned it may be pointed out that the subsidy under the 1923 Act is 50% of the net loss on the scheme, including the re-houslng of the dispossessed persons.     On the other hand the subsidy for new houses under the 1024 Act is two thirds of the loss and it would appear not unreasonable that the proportion should be two thirds in both cases, especially if owners are to be given more favourable terms as suggested below.     But it would be better, if possible, at this stagey only to promise a substantial increase in the subsidy leaving the proportion or even the method of calculation to be determined when the Bill is drafted.As to (2) the present procedure is being investigated with a view to seeing what would be practicable and desirable.10. As to the method of compensation, it issuggested that if section 46 were repealed a new basis6-
tj hi \Jmight be found upon the principles which were laid down by the Unhealthy Areas Committee formerly alluded to in their Final Report of April 1921.     Theso principles are as follows:-(1)   Where a landlord has allowed his property to fall into a condition which la unfit for human habitation, it is not equitable that he should receive anything by way of compensation for the structure, even though he continue to draw revenue from it by reason of the exceptional shortage of accommodation now prevailing.(2)   Where an area is unhealthy by reason of the number or arrangement of the buildings upon it, it is equitable to consider that all such buildings are depreciated in value by that condition, even when they may in themselves bf^ unexceptionable *To carry these principles into operation all property included in an area which, by a resolution of the local authority, has been declared to be an unhealthy area would first be valued on the basis of market value. In arriving at this market value any enhancement of the existing rental due to the premises being used for illegal purposes or being so overcrowded as to be dangerous or injurious to the health of the inmates would be discounted and where the premises were in a state of defective sanitation or not in reasonably good repair the cost of putting them Into a sanitary condition or into reasonably good repair would be taken into account.    No doubt in many cases the valuation arrived at would not exceed the value of the old materials.     To the net value of each individual property so arrived at wouldthen be applied a reduction factor which would operate6.
J l-j Uuniformly over the whole area, but which need not necessarily be the same for every area, being based on the general conditions obtaining in each area.     It is not necessary now to determine the limits within which this reduction factor should be confined - they would form naturally the subject of discussion with local authorities and with representatives of property owners before any Amending Bill were drafted.11, The preceding paragraphs suggest a method of improving the present procedure In regard to slum, clearance but it is not pretended that even with this improvement the process of clearance is likely to attain such proportions as to solve the slum problem within the lifetime of the present generation.    Something more is required. Some additional or supplementary means of attacking the problem must be found and in looking round for an alternative method attention is naturally attracted by one whioh Is already in force, namely the powers given under existing Acts to local authorities to make representations to owners of slum property and to require them to carry out suitable repairs.    It is a remarkable fact that In contrast to the meagre numbers dealt with under slum clearance, over half a million houses a year are reconditioned under these alternative powers and this striking contrast seems to point to some development of this process as the most hopeful direction In which further progress may be made. Without questioning in any way the value   of the work which is being done on the representations of local authorities by private landlords in Improving their property, it must, nevertheless, be admitted that the procedure as it stands- V
is not entirely adequate to the situation.    It is,  in fact, open to three defects.    In the first place the local authority naturally has regard to the resources of the land-lord whom they are pressing to spend money upon his house and in many cases the landlord&apos;s resources are of a very slender character; consequently there is a tendency to prescribe the least rather than the most that might be done to improve the property.      Secondly,  the work is sporadic in its nature;    a house here and a house there are selected and whilst the improvement to the individual house may be great nothing is done to lessen the evil brought about by the proximity of other houses, nor is anything substantial effected in the raising of the tone of the district.    Lastly, it must be remembered that at the root of the slum problem lies the question of management.    A bad landlord makes a bad tenant and more than that a bad tenant makes a bad neighbourhood;    thus a good landlord is not encouraged in any effort to improve the character of his tenants if they are surrounded by tenants of other landlords who take no such pains.12. In any new policy which contemplates the reconditioning and improvement of small houses upon an extensive scale, it would appear that two conditions at least are essential.     First that the cost of the scheme to the Local Authority should not be so oppressive as to prevent their undertaking to deal with extensive areas,  and second that over a really considerable araa there should he a uniform system of management, at once firm and sympathetic, which may raise the whole tone and atmosphere of the neighbourhood and convert slum tenants into self-respecting8.
mi*.* t.s jt-\and car-aful householders.    The proposals which.follow are designod to include those tv;o vital factors.13. It must be clearly understood that the- policy herelaid down is intended not as a substitute for new building or for slum clearance, but cs a supplement to them.    The powers of local authorities under existing legislation are designed primarily for,  and are in fact really adapted only to, compulsory acquisition and clearance.      It is proposed that they should be given powers not merely to clear but also to hold the property acquired and to improve it by pulling down where necessary to admit more light and air, by adding sanitary and other conveniences and by generally reconditioning the houses that still are to remain.    The terms of compensation would be on the lines suggested above in paragraph 10 and It would be proposed that a state subsidy should be paid In respect of the expenditure of a local authority upon the site.   The terms of this subsidy need not now be defined;    It would be left to be discussed with the local authorities when the Bill was in preparation.    It is, howeverjj suggested that any new houses provided outside of the area for the purpose of accommodating any of the persons who might be dispossessed In consequence of the demolition of their house, would be subject not to the slum improvement subsidy^ but to the ordinary subsidy payable under the Act of 1924, whatever that might be at the time.14. If this new proposal proved as effective as it Ishoped it would,  the result would be the acquisition by local authorities of very large numbers of houses at a low value and a consequent enormous addition to the number of municipaltenants.    It Is felt that the problems raised by such a state9- .
large masses of the people that they ought not to he the sport of local cross currents or political exploitation.    If as stated above the key to slum improvement is to be found in good managersnJ ,  the&apos;&quot; such management must be elevated into a profession and must be carried out upon national rather than upon local lines.    It is not desired that local enterprise and initiative should be suppressed but it is believed that it will be possible to safeguard these features while yet preserving the main lines of proper house management.15. Accordingly it is proposed, as one of the main features of the scheme, to set up a National House Management Commission.     Such a Commission, composed of suitable persons drawn from various classes and both sexes and unpaid, would be not an executive but an advisory body, like the Central Valuation Committee in another sphere.    Its task would be to consider the problems that arise In the management of small house property and from time to time    to make recommendations as to the way in which they should be approached.    It would further be an advisory body to the Minister of Health in certain circumstances which will be described bolow.16. Corresponding to the National Commission It is proposedto give local authorities power to appoint Local House Management Commissions to be set up any time after the passing of tho Act,    The first duties of such Commissions might be to advise the local authority as to areas to be dealt with In the process of slum improvement and as to the alterations and improvements which might be made in the properties comprised in the scheme.    But when the local authority had actually acquired the properties under this procedure it would then be its10.
duty under the statute to hand over the management to the Local Commission, who would act as the Agents for the authority but would be subject to certain general rules laid down in the Act itself.     These rules would provide, among other things, for a fixing of the rents in such a way as neither to be exorbitant on the one hand nor so slow as to undercut similar property in private hands in the neighbourhood,17. It Is contemplated that the Local Commission, inconsultation with the local authority, would prepare its scheme for the Improvement of the property thus taken over and on approval of this scheme by the local authority the alterations would then be carried out, the finance being provided by the local authority and supplemented, by the Exchequer Grant,     The inclusion of the latter naturally involves also the approval of the scheme by the Minister of Health,18. It is to be expected that the local authorities willnot willingly surrender their control over the management of their own property, but nevertheless it is considered that this is on essential feature of the scheme.     It would, however.. be possible to provide that if they were dissatisfied with the prooeecings of the Commission, who would, of course, have to render thorn annual reports and accounts, they could remove them subject to the approval again of the Minister of Health, who, in such cases, would take the advice of the National Commission.19. It will be seen that the keynote of theiconceptionoutlined is not merely the provision of better   accommodation for slum tenants but an attempt to deal with the human problem by the education of the tenants to a higher standard.     To take
I 0*\ &apos;---a-people who have been accustomed to slum conditions, to the indifference of the landlord to their welfare, and to a complete irrespans billty for the care of their miserable hovels and to put     im into the new houses provided by the municipalitiesp i        impose upon them a test which isaltogether4 unfaib     But the kindly and sympathetic management which was initl&amp;tad by Octavia Hill and is carried on by-many women managers today, has been proved by experience to have a remarkable effect in arousing a new sense of pride among the tenants in their dwellings and in instilling into them notions of personal hygiene which cannot fail to react on their physical health and that of their children.    Undera National Commission such as is proposed it is hoped that this systorn would become general and if some assistance dould be given to approved training colleges it might be expected that a new profession might be opened up to women in the management of house property to which they are particularly  ,? well suited since it is the housewife with whom they have to deal.20. Finally, it may be pointed out that the possessionof considerable areas of land by the Local Authority would immensely simplify the replanning on better lines of the built-up portions of our great cities as opportunity arises in the future. The improved procedure may enable slum clearance to be carried out more rapidly and expeditiously than it has been up to now.    But even so the process cannot be so rapid as to solve the problem in the lifetime of the present generation and for those who have to wait tho new supplementary policy would provide a means of vastly improved conditions, both moral and material, which might well be madeavailable within a comparatively short space of time.12.
