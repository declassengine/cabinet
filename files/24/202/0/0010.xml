I This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.   February 1929.SECRET.CP. 60 (29).CABINET.ANGLO-EGYPTIAN FINANCIAL NEGOTIATIONS.Note by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.I CIRCULATE herewith, for the information of my colleagues, a Report by Mr. F. W. Leith-Ross of the Treasury on his recent negotiations with the Egyptian Government in regard to the settlement of the 1855 Loan and other outstanding financial questions.The agreement arrived at with the Egyptian Finance Minister appears to me to be very satisfactory. Its completion is dependent on confirmation by the Egyptian Council of Ministers, which may be delayed owing to political considerations; but I hope that any delay will not be protracted.I propose that Lord Lloyd should be authorised to sign the documents as soon as the Egyptian Government intimate their readiness to do so; and that he should be asked to press for the completion of the agreement early next month if no intimation is received from the Egyptian Government on the subject before then.W. S. C.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1, February 25, 1929.Copy No.28[18911]
[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government. \CONFIDENTIAL.NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE EGYPTIAN GOVERNMENT.I ATTACH herewith copies of the documents which were agreed and initialled by the Egyptian Finance Minister, Aly Maher Pasha, and myself on the 5th instant. These documents are : I. Agreement for the settlement of Egypt&apos;s liability for the 1855 Loan and for the payment to Egypt of a share of reparations; II. Letter to be sent by the British representative stating that the British Government will not renounce the Egyptian share of reparations without the consent of the Egyptian Government;III. Exchange of letters giving the Egyptian Government the right, on or before the 1st February, 1930, to redeem their future liabilities in respect of the 1855 Loan by a cash payment at 90 per cent, of face value; andIV. Exchange of letters providing for the settlement of the outstanding ShippingLiquidation and Army claims for a cash payment of  849,000.It may be useful if I add some explanation of the proposals which are embodied in these documents.2. 1855 Loan. Since 1924 the Egyptian Government, in pursuance of a Resolution of the Egyptian Parliament, have withheld payment of the annuity of  72,000 per annum, formerly contributed to the Service of the 1855 Loan, and have paid the money to a Suspense Account. In the meantime, the British Government, under their guarantee, have had to make good the deficienc)^ and have advanced the sums required partly from the Cyprus Tribute Account and partly from Exchequer funds. I made it clear from the outset that it was an essential condition of any settlement, that the Egyptian Government should make good the arrears of contribution, up to and including the 1st February, 1929, and this the Egyptian Government undertake to do. The total amount of these arrears is  328,600, of which  163,022 16s. 9d. is repayable to the Cyprus Tribute Account and  165,577 3s. 3d. to the Exchequer. This sum is due for payment immediately on the acceptance of the Agreement.3. The Egyptian Government also undertake (as part of a general settlement and without any definite admission of legal liability) to provide for a proportion of the outstanding Loan to the amount of  1,386,000 nominal value. This amount was  arrived  at by  deducting  from  the  amount  of  the  Loan  outstanding,Viz.     ... ... ... ... ...       3,815,200The amount of the Loan already purchased and now held by the Cyprus Tribute Account, viz.         642,400Leaving a balance held by the public of       ...       3,172,800Of this outstanding debt, Egypt is to accept responsibility for a proportion equivalent to the proportion which her annual contribution (viz.,  72,000 per annum) bore to the total provision for the Service of the Loan before 1924 (viz.,  164,800), and this share works out at  1,386,000.His Majesty&apos;s Government were committed by their previous declarations to treat the Loan bought out of the surplus of the Cyprus Tribute Account up to 1924 as the nucleus of a Sinking Fund, so that the Egyptian Government were entitled to claim that this part of the Loan should be cancelled and disregarded. They might, indeed, have gone further and claimed that the Certificates that may be bought with the repayment to the Cyprus Tribute Account of  163,022 provided for above should similarly be cancelled and excluded from the apportionment. On the other hand, the British Government might have claimed that the Egyptian propor-tion of the debt should be calculated by reference to the provision for interest on the Loan only, and that it should accordingly be 72 : 153 instead of 72 : 164. The settlement reached was a compromise which seemed to me fair and reasonable.[18879] . b
4. Relation to Reparations. The Egyptian Government agree to discharge this liability by an immediate payment of  302,310 (being the share of reparations due to them up to date), and by sixteen annuities of approximately  90,000 per annum, to be met out of the future Egyptian share of reparations, as it accrues, it being understood that Egypt will pay in cash any balance required at the end of the quarter.The Council of Ministers had, as I telegraphed on the 1st instant, pressed strongly that the payments to be made by Egypt in respect of the 1855 Loan should be contingent on reparations. While I agreed that as an administrative arrange -ment, to avoid unnecessary cross-payments, the Egyptian debt payments might be met out of the Egyptian reparation receipts so far as they were available, I main-tained that Egypt must undertake to meet any deficiency herself. It seemed to me that any admission that the payments should be absolutely contingent on reparations, might prove embarrassing to His Majesty&apos;s Government in connexion with other debt settlements. During the discussions which ensued, it transpired that the Egyptian Minister for Foreign Affairs was apprehensive that His Majesty&apos;s Government might be committed by the Balfour Note to renounce the whole British Empire share of reparations, including the share payable to Egypt. I explained that this was a misconception, and on my undertaking to address to the Egyptian Government an assurance in the terms of Document II, the Council of Ministers agreed to drop their proposal that the liability for the 1855 Loan should be contingent on reparations.5. Redemption of Loan. The method of redemption of the Egyptian share of the Loan gave rise to a great deal of discussion. The whole of the Loan was duly drawn for redemption more than a quarter of a century ago, but as the original debtor, the Imperial Ottoman Government, failed to provide the funds required for their repayment, the Certificates have continued to circulate and to receive interest. The British and French Governments guaranteed this interest, but they did not guarantee the Sinking Fund payments; and as the Treaty of Lausanne has now discharged the Ottoman Government from all liability, the holders of the Loan appear to have no right to redemption. In these circumstances, any arrangement under which the British and Egyptian Governments undertook to redeem specified proportions of the Loan would have given the holders an uncovenanted benefit, and if such an undertaking were published, it would almost certainly lead to the Loan being held for redemption at par, instead of being purchasable at the current price of a 4 per Cent. Government Stock (say, 87). The operation of a Sinking Fund would have been particularly difficult if the British and Egyptian Governments were purchasing the Loan in the market simultaneously but separately; and it was obviously desirable that the management of the Sinking Fund operations should in any case be confided to one hand.6. I finally agreed with the Finance Minister to avoid these difficulties by letting the Egyptian Government redeem its liability for the Loan by a -payment to the British Government, in return for which the British Government undertook full and complete responsibility for the Loan in future.&quot;In order to avoid exciting market expectations, there is no provision actually obliging His Majesty&apos;s Government to purchase and retire Certificates of the Loan to the amount of the Egyptian payments; and it would be open to His Majesty&apos;s Government to pay the Egyptian contributions to the Exchequer and to leave the 4 per cent. Guaranteed Loan to continue indefinitely as a part of the National Debt, all claims both against Egypt and France being discharged. But the understanding on which the settlement with Egypt has been based is that the Loan would be retired, and I assume that the Egyptian payments will be used, like the surplus of the Cyprus Tribute account, to purchase Certificates on the market in so far as they can be obtained at a reasonable price say, not exceeding the adjusted price of 4 per cent. Consols. Should the Certificates not be obtainable at that price, the moneys should be invested and accumulated till the total fund available suffices to redeem the whole of the outstanding Loan at par, when notice could be given to the holders and the Loan could be extinguished. I propose that a Treasury Minute should be prepared prescribing this procedure.7. Egyptian right to pre-pay Anmiities. The calculations on which the agreed payments are based are that the  302,310 payable by Egypt immediately in cash can be utilised to extinguish Bonds at 87^; but that, as it is impossible to predict the course of Government credit over the next 16 years, all further purchases must be
reckoned at par. The Finance Minister had been anxious, if possible, to redeem the whole of the liability apportioned to Egypt by means of an outright cash payment, in order to take advantage of the present comparatively low price; and in view of the advantage to us of securing payment in full from Egypt, I had offered in that event to accept payment at 90. The Council of Ministers were not prepared to adopt the Finance Minister&apos;s proposal, but they left him discretion to make a partial prepay-meiit of the future annuities, if he thought fit, as an administrative arrangement. Accordingly, I agreed that the Egyptian Government should have the right to make further cash jmyrnents, in redemption of their liability, and that such payments, if made before the 1st February, 1930, would be accepted on the basis that  90 casb^  100 Bonds; and this arrangement is provided for in the exchange of letters (Document III). As the Egyptian Government have large Reserve funds on deposit at the National Bank, and earning 1 per cent, below Bank Rate, such a prepayment maybe advantageous to them, and (without making any definite promise) the Finance Minister gave me to understand that he would very likely pay up a further  500,000 or so of cash, under this option. If and when he does so, we should have to arrange for the necessary adjustment of the future Egyptian payments, of which either the annual amount or the period would be reduced, as the Egyptian Government preferred.8. Shipping and Army Claims. There remain the outstanding claims of the Shipping Liquidation Department and the Army claim for refund of Customs Duties. This latter claim was not originally within the scope of my negotiations, as it had been submitted, by agreement, to arbitration. But shortly after I arrived in Cairo, the arbitrators found themselves in a deadlock, as Bedawi Pasha (the Egyptian arbitrator) had raised a constitutional point, viz., that the Customs franchise had been granted to the British Army by the British Financial Under-Secretary; but that it had never been confirmed or approved by the Egyptian Government, and could, therefore, not be invoked as a basis of claim against the Egyptian Government. The Egyptian Government offered to submit this constitutional point to a legal arbitrator, but. they were not prepared to overrule Bedawi Pasha., who has a position of very great influence with the Government. As, on the other hand, the British Government could obviously not agree to arbitrate the constitutional question, the Army claim wTas in danger of being held up indefinitely. In these circumstances, the Financial Adviser pressed me not to conclude my negotiations without securing a settlement of the Army claim; and after discussing the position with the Residency and the Army financial representatives and obtaining the authority conveyed in Foreign Office Telegram No. 38 of the 31st January, I took the claim up with Aly Matter. At that time, we had agreed to settle the Shipping Liquidation claim for  600,000; and Aly Maher would not admit more than  150,000 for the Army claim. Under pressure, he advanced to  E. 200,000 ( =  205,000); but (apparently as the result of advice from Bedawi Pasha) the Council of Ministers would not go beyond this figure. On the other hand, I held out for  250,000 for the Army claim, in addition to the  600,000 for the Shipping claim. Finally, the Finance Minister offered to put back the Shipping Claim to  644,000 and to lump it with the Army claim for a total of  849,000, to be paid, half on the 15th March and the balance on the 15th June next, and this settlement I accepted (see Document IV). It leaves it open to the Treasury to fix the payment to the Army at any figure they think fit between  205,000 and  249,000; but as I had definitely offered to take  600,000 for the Shipping Debt, I think the Army is equitably entitled to the whole of the balance, and I recommend that they be allowed  249,000 out of the payment, to be made on the 15th June next.9. In general, the negotiations with the Minister of Finance were carried out in a spirit of complete cordiality. The Minister gave me the impression of being genuinely anxious to settle these questions and of being prepared to accept a proposal once he was convinced of its reasonableness. The most difficult part of the negotiations came after a settlement had been reached, in principle, with Aly Maher, owing to objections raised by the Council of Ministers and finally by Bedawi Pasha, whose action in regard to the Army claim has already been referred to. Bedawi Pasha, who is appropriately entitled &quot; Chef des Contentieux,&quot; tried hard, under pretext of legal draftsmanship, to revise the whole of the arrangement that had been arrived at with the Finance Minister, but, after an animated discussion for some hours, I agreed to accept his form of agreement (obscure and inappropriate though I thought it) on condition that he revised the substantive clauses to meet my views. .[18879] b 2.
- 4v10. Owing to the absence of the Prime Minister in Upper Egypt, the Finance Minister was not in a position to do more than initial the documents, but he assured me that he anticipated no difficulty in securing the concurrence of the Prime Minister on the latter&apos;s return or in any case before the end of February.The communique agreed with the Finance Minister at our final interview, of which I attach a copy, should help to secure an early decision. The Financial Adviser warned me not to take the Finance Ministers assurances too literally, and it may be that the Egyptian Government will seek to obtain some political concession (e.g., about the revision of the Customs tariff) as a condition of their bringing the agreement into effect. I told the Finance Minister that the early acceptance and execution of the Agreement would no doubt impress Flis Majesty&apos;s Government favourably, and certainly help to improve the general relations between the two countries by removing a source of friction, while any delay in executing the Agree-ment would undoubtedly create a bad impression and lead His Majesty&apos;s Government to think that the Egyptian Government were afraid to carry into effect arrangements which their responsible Minister had accepted as equitable. But I emphasised that the Agreement was a financial bargain, which was justifiable on its merits, and that the Egyptian Government had no right to claim political concessions as well. Tt may be hoped that the Egyptian Government will at an early date authorise the Finance Minister to complete the Agreement, and I assume that in that event Lord Lloyd will sign it on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government..11. Throughout the negotiations I kept in close consultation with and received much assistance from Mr. F. P. Watson, O.B.E., the Financial Adviser, and his staff, and from the staff of the Residency, to all of whom I should like an expression of thanks to be conveyed officially. A copy of this Report might also be sent to them for their information.(Signed) F. W. LETTH-ROSS.February 7, 1.929.A. Texts as Initialled.I.
