REPORT.Part I.INTRODUCTORY.THE   Sub-Committee   was   appointed   by   the   Prime   Minister   on   the 5th December, 1927, with the composition shown on the previous page, to consider the question of belligerent rights at sea as raised in Cabinet Papers CP. 258 (27) CP. 286 (27) and CP. 287 (27).2. On the 17th October, 1928, the Cabinet referred to the Sub-Committee, in addition, the question of the renewal of our Arbitration Treaties which have expired or are about to expire. This aspect of the question has already been dealt with in a separate Report (Paper CP. 40 (29)).Origin of the Inquiry.3. After the failure in August 1927 of the Three-Power Naval Conference on Reduction and Limitation of Naval Armaments at Geneva, the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs came to the conclusion that the differences between the United States of America and ourselves centred in the use which we make of our Navy in time of war to enforce our view of the rights of a belligerent at sea. Sir Austen Chamberlain was reinforced in this opinion by private and confidential letters addressed to Sir William Tyrrell (at that time Permanent Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs) by His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Washington, and by the views held in the Foreign Office itself. This raised in Sir Austen&apos;s mind the question of whether it was desirable, and, if desirable, possible, to attempt to reach an agree-ment with the United States upon the disputed points of international law. Sir Austen Chamberlain - emphasised the urgency of the question in the following words: &apos;&apos; It cannot be denied that the present difference on this subject between the United States and ourselves is the only matter which makes war between our two nations conceivable. But I go further; I believe that General Preston Brown does not exaggerate when he says that any attempt by us to enforce our rights in a future war where the United States were neutral, as we enforced them in the late war, would make war between us &apos; probable.&apos; The world position has been altered to our disadvantage, and what was possible in the past may have become impossible in the future.&quot;   (Paper CP. 258 (27).)4. In contradistinction of two letters from Sir Esme Howard and other papers supporting this view, Sir Austen Chamberlain circulated (Paper CP. 286 (27)) to the Cabinet Notes by the Secretary to the Cabinet and the Committee of Imperial Defence and by Sir Cecil Hurst, the Legal Adviser to the Foreign Office, giving reasons against reopening this highly controversial question at the present time.5. As the result of a preliminary discussion by the Cabinet, the Prime Minister set up the present Sub-Committee.Procedure.6. The subject of our investigation is one of great magnitude. Nearly every aspect is controversial. Many volumes have been devoted to neutral and belligerent rights and freedom of the seas, and the standard works on naval history and inter national law contain many references to the subject. Space prohibits us from dealing with the earlier history of the question, a summary of which is to be found m Vol. XXIII of the Peace Handbooks prepared under the auspices of the Foreign Office for use at the Peace Conference, under the title &quot; Freedom of the Seas. Nevertheless, we have collected much additional documentary evidence. The Secretary to the Committee of Imperial Defence has furnished material from the archives in his custody, including particulars of the breakdown during the War of a number of international agreements previously concluded;  an account of the
incident at the Armistice discussions when the Allies, on the initiative of Mr. Lloyd George, reserved the second of President Wilson&apos;s Fourteen Points relating to Freedom of the Seas, notwithstanding Colonel House&apos;s threat that America would withdraw from the war; papers prepared for the Imperial War Cabinet before the Peace Conference by the Admiralty and by a Legal Committee under the Chairmanship of the late Lord Cave; a recent Report by the Legal Sub-Committee of the Advisory Committee on Trade and Blockade on our blockade practice during the War; as well as comments on other papers presented to the Sub-Committee. The Admiralty have formulated in detail their present claims in regard to the exercise of belligerent rights, and have expressed their views as to the effect of any abatement of these claims to meet American views, as well as on other aspects of our Inquiry. The Foreign Office have kept us constantly informed of all develop-ments of this question in the United States of America. In addition to a number of. despatches from Sir Esme Howard in regard to American opinion, we had the advantage of the Ambassadors presence at one meeting. We also received a written report, as well as verbal commentary thereon, from Mr. Craigie, the head of the American Department in the Foreign Office, on his return from a visit to the United States of America. The Foreign Office reports include full particulars of a Convention of Maritime Neutrality drawn up at the Pan-American Conference in Havana in February 1928. In addition to memoranda by the Chairman and several members of the Committee, we have received memoranda from outside, from the Minister of Labour and the Parliamentary Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs. At the suggestion of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, the whole of our proceedings were sent to Admiral Sir Herbert Richmond, until recently the Commandant of the Imperial Defence College, who has contributed valuable memoranda on Blockade. In addition, a Legal Technical Sub-Committee has compiled a most important Report on the technical aspects of our terms of reference, to which we frequently refer in this Report.7.   The results of our deliberations on these matters will now be summarised.Part II.GENERAL POLICY.High or Low Belligerent Rights ?8. The first matter to which we directed attention, and one to which we more than once returned, is the fundamental question of principle as to whether it is in the interest of the Empire to maintain belligerent rights high, as in the past, or to recede from our previous attitude.9. Historically, as the Cabinet and Committee of Imperial Defence are aware, the argument, is in favour of high belligerent rights. In the greatest wars of our history the exercise of these rights has often proved a decisive factor : &quot; For two hundred years,&quot; wrote Admiral Mahan, &quot; England has been the great commercial nation of the world. More than any other her wealth has been entrusted to the sea in war as in peace; yet, of all nations, she has ever been most reluctant to concede the immunities of commerce and the rights of neutrals. Regarded not as a matter of right, but of policy, history has justified the refusal; and if she maintain her Navy in full strength, the future will doubtless repeat the lesson of the past.&quot;   (&quot; The Influence of Sea Power upon History.&quot;)Although some concessions were made, by international agreement, to the position of neutrals between 1815 and 1914, these failed to stand the test of unlimited war, and, before the end of 1916, partly owing to their vagueness and partly in retaliation for breaches of the laws of war by the enemy, they had disappeared. In spite of immense pressure from neutrals, and more especially during the first part of the War from the United States of America, who were in the last resort in a position to enforce their claims owing to the dependence of the Allies upon them for supplies, the Allies, nevertheless, were able to increase their economic pressure every year of the War until, and this time with the co-operation given by the United States from April 1917 onwards, the economic weapon again became once more one of the decisive factors in victory.
10. It has been suggested, however, that times have changed. An essential factor in maintaining high belligerent rights is sea supremacy. That, it is said, we no longer possess, since we have accepted equality with the United States of America andL indeed, not only so, but owing to the vast increase of population and wealth in the United States it is going to be more and more difficult to maintain even equality in sea-power. Moreover, America is now conscious of her power, and there is a strong public movement against allowing her trade to be interfered with by a belligerent. This is, in fact, one of the main arguments by which public opinion in America is being induced to support the movement for the expansion of the Fleet. In these circumstances it is suggested that for us to insist on our right to interfere with neutral trade is simply to stimulate American naval competition. The question is put, &quot; Would it not be better to bow to the inevitable and make all the concessions that may be asked of us ?&quot; By doing so, it is pointed out, we may hope to remove the argument in favour of naval expansion, which makes the strongest appeal to moderate opinion in the United States, and so free ourselves from the risk of a competition in armaments with a country richer than ourselves. This aspect is strengthened by the speeches made in the recent debates in the Senate at Washington. In support of this view it has also been urged that the circumstances of the late war are never likely to recur, that it is impossible to imagine circumstances in which it would be worth while to adopt a policy of economic pressure against an enemy, and that in any event it would be ineffective.11. These arguments in favour of concessions are carried still further by a reference to our dependence on oversea trade even for the prime necessities of existence. It is recalled that during the War our trade suffered severely from the depredations of surface raiders and submarines, and that at one time the position became one of extreme peril. In these circumstances it has been urged that this danger can best be removed by entrusting our security primarily to international law, and that our best course is to work for Conventions based on lower belligerent rights. This, it is contended, would have the further advantage of liberating our trade from the restrictions to which it is liable from belligerent action in wars in which we ourselves are a neutral.12. Finally, much has been made, particularly in public discussions, of the alleged cruelty of economic pressure, and some stress has been laid on the iniquity of interfering with neutral trade. Attention has been drawn to the strength of public opinion on this subject in the United States, whose views may be shared in some quarters in the Dominions and have a considerable echo in this country.13. To each of these arguments in favour of a policy described as &quot;swinging towards Freedom of the Seas,&quot; an answer has been given, and, in addition, counter-arguments have been brought forward in favour of the maintenance of high belligerent rights, which the Sub-Committee (with the exception of Lord Cushendun) consider conclusive.14. Taking first the reply to the arguments summarised in paragraph 10, it is not disputed that the United States now share with us the supremacy of the seas, nor that they would have the power in a future war to interfere with the exercise of belligerent rights. The supporters of high belligerent rights point out, however, that this is no new factor. Long before the War we knew that neutrals, and particularly the United States, had the power to make the exercise of belligerent rights very difficult, if not impossible. This was in effect the argument used by Lord Clarendon as long ago as 1856 in order to justify acceptance of the Declaration of Paris. It was also an argument used in defence of the Declaration of London. During the War America had the power to interfere with the so-called blockade. She possessed the third fleet in the world, and, as already mentioned, complete control of supplies on which the Allies depended. She could, if she had so desired, have refused to sell to the Allies that indispensable war material of to-day oil -without which warships, submarines, armies, tanks and aircraft cannot move. She could have refused transportation through her ports of Canadian grain, or to sell her own grain. She could have refused to furnish munitions or machinery for their manufacture. She could, in fact, have returned to Jefferson&apos;s Non-Intercourse Policy, which, though indecisive at the time, would to-day produce results far greater than they could at the beginning of the last century. There is also ample evidence that she was fully conscious of her power, and that there was a strong movement in favour of exercising it. Nevertheless, for one reason or another predominance of sympathy with the cause of the Allies, irritation at the enemyJs breaches of the laws of war,
internal prosperity due to supplying the Allies, the political influence of interested traders, and so forth she lacked the will to exert pressure actively. Why then, it is asked, should we assume that in a future and probably distant war every circumstance is going to be against us ? Why should we trust to arguments which were used before the War and were disproved by the experience of the War ? Why should we base ourselves on the assumption that in a future war, however odious and provocative may be the aggression of an enemy, we shall never have America as an ally, or as a sympathiser, or even in a state of reluctance to become embroiled in a distant conflict? Wars in which high belligerent rights are a decisive factor are few and far between. The next occasion in which they may be required is almost certainly remote; its- conditions are impossible to forecast; and it would be folly by international agreement to preclude ourselves from using what has often proved our principal means of putting pressure on an enemy. Of course the arguments must not be pressed too far. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs points out that &apos; it cannot be inferred because she had the poAver and did not use it &quot;in 1914-17, that, therefore, she will not use it in a future struggle. Throughout the early years of the Great War the situation was always delicate and often critical. In the last resort we were saved not so much by the large concessions which we made as by the greater irritation caused by German outrages. It would be unsafe to base our policy on the assumption that the conduct of our enemies will always be more offensive to neutrals than our own, and that diplomacy will always be able to judge the exact extent to which we can avoid an open breach.15. The contention that, by advocating low belligerent rights, or Freedom of the Seas, we should permanently remove the basis of the American &quot; Big Navy &quot; move-ment, is also contested. American naval competition will not be prevented by paper concessions in the negotiations. If deprived of one argument the Big Navy Party will before long find another, possibly, for example, in the complete breakdown of the laws of war in the Great War. It could be alleged that Great Britain would always find means for evading her obligations, as she did in the Great War, under the excuse of retaliation. That such an allegation is not altogether without foundation is shown by the fact that the argument has been used several times during the present Inquiry; for example, in the following terms : -&apos;&apos; Under such circumstances, if the unexpected happens and a blockade of the enemy appears possible, without equivalent detriment to ourselves, the lesson of the last war (cynical as it may be) teaches us that by one evasion or another the blockade will be brought about.&quot;   (B.R. 19.)The surrender of belligerent rights, moreover, would not abolish and ought not to reduce the heed for cruisers to protect troop movements and ships carrying war material against naval attack. Technical questions of 8-inch guns versus 6-inch guns, large cruisers or small, would at the best only be easier to the extent that a better atmosphere would be created by agreement on belligerent rights.16. The suggestion that the circumstances of the last War are unlikely ever to be repeated is regarded by the supporters of high belligerent rights as a very unconvincing speculation. Forecasts of this nature are dangerous in the extreme. It is totally impossible to foresee what the situation in Europe or elsewhere may be two generations hence. Who, even 60 years ago, could have forecast that the Prussia of that day would become so powerful as to constitute a danger to the civilisation of the world? Who, 150 years ago, when proposals were made to cede Gibraltar to Spain, could have foreseen that its possession would be a vital element in the security of British and French trade in a war with Germany ? Forecasts even by experienced Statesmen have a bad record. It was only in 1792 that Pitt foresaw a long period of peace; and in the Summer of 1870 that the Permanent Secretary of the Foreign Office anticipated no disturbances in Europe. The possibility that another disturber of the peace may arise to threaten the freedom of the world has not vanished with the disappearance of autocracies. If, under some new guise, some Power, or group of Powers, attempts to enforce upon other peoples their theories of government, those peoples may be compelled to unite in opposition, and once more the power to isolate the aggressors may well be an even more important factor than it has been in the past, owing to the demands of modern life having developed in directions which render nations less self-sufficient than they were in earlier times.17.   As to the effectiveness of blockade and interception of contraband, the mistake usually made by the advocates of Freedom of the Seas is to consider them
as decisive measures in themselves. This is comparatively rarely the case. Economic pressure must be regarded as only one of a series of measures inducing a conviction of the necessity of compliance on the enemy Power. It may conduce to surrender either by preventing the enemy people from receiving what they require and selling their own products abroad, or by preventing the fighting forces fromGetting what they need in the way of the instruments and material of war, or, as istory shows us again and again, by a combination of the two methods of invasion and investment, the one contributing to the other. One might with almost equal force say that tanks or artillery are useless, since, by themselves, neither can produce a decision. The doctrine of liaison in arms is no less applicable to strategy than to tactics. &apos;18. The argument set forth in paragraph 11 that, owing to our dependence on overseas trade we are likely to suffer more than our enemies from high belligerent rights, and that our true interests would be better served by trusting to the protection we should derive from an international code of law based on low belligerent rights, is not a new one. It was the basis of the late Lord Loreburn&apos;s much criticised letter to the &quot; Times &quot; of the 15th October, 1905, and was the main ground of defence for some of the provisions of the Declaration of London. It was not borne out by the experience of the war. It is true that we suffered severely from the German submarine campaign, but, to quote the &quot;Official History of Seaborne Trade&quot; (Vol. Ill, Chapter XXVII), &quot;at no time was the reduction of supplies sufficient to inflict vital injury on the economic life of the country .... at their worst, the conditions never approached those in Germany, or even in other allied countries.&quot; In striking contrast to this stands the terrible picture by the same authority of the &quot;desperate&quot; plight of the Central Powers, who are described as &quot;economically prostrate.&quot; We suffered grave embarrassment; the enemy disaster. The truth is that Freedom of the Seas, except in the extreme form proposed by Colonel House in 1915 as applying to belligerent as well as to neutral shipping (which is shown later to be impracticahle) would not be of much use to us. We depend for our trade not on neutral but on British tonnage. Even if we could secure Freedom of the Seas to neutral shipping, we should not obtain the tonnage necessary for the security of our trade. So great a proportion of the world&apos;s tonnage is British that the quantity of neutral tonnage that would be available for carrying British trade would not nearly suffice for our needs. British Empire tonnage amounts to 22-^ million tons (United Kingdom 19f millions, the rest of the Empire 2f millions) out of a world tonnage of approximately 65 million tons.19. In adopting a policy of low belligerent rights or Freedom of the Seas we should be surrendering a most important offensive weapon without even obtaining in return security for our trade, for the war proved that we cannot rely on the observance of the law by an enemy who hopes to secure victory by its violation. International agreements, to which the United States were, among others, ever a party, were made in plenty at The Hague in 1907. Neutral territory was not to be violated; hospital ships were to be immune; mines were to be laid only under defined conditions and in defined places; prisoners of war. were to receive proper treatment; open towns were not to be bombarded; merchant ships were to be treated in an agreed manner. Every one of these was broken by Germany without a protest from any neutral Power, including the United States, except in. cases where their own interests were involved; and the breach in some cases, notably the invasion of Belgium and the mining of commercial ports, was not even made under the stress of impending defeat, but was planned in the cool atmosphere preceding the war. Even our losses from submarines were due to the trust we placed in the law of nations. The reason for them was not that the submarine was invincible nor trade indefensible, but that the Allied Governments did not possess the means of combating a form of warfare which had been forbidden by international agreement. When the necessary flotilla had been created and the convoy system became possible, the losses from submarines were brought within control, and all danger of a collapse from that cause ceased. On the contrary, it would create a false sense of security, and make it more difficult, both nationally and internationally, for a Government to provide those defensive measures on which, in time of war, the safety of our commerce must depend, or those means of retaliation which might compel an unwilling enemy to honour his obligations.20. On the ethics of blockade and capture at sea, the question which arises is what is the object of war ? Why do nations fight ? They fight because of a difference of view concerning the possession of territory or for some object which they deem vital to their security or in the defence
of public faith. The object is to compel compliance upon their adversary, to force him to abandon attack upon the disputed territory, or to abandon his claims in whatever sense they are formulated. To compel this compliance two courses of action are open : One is the use of unlimited force by land and air, involving&apos; probably the occupation of the enemy country or the disputed territory until the enemy gives way; the other method is to get control of his external channels of supply and distribution, so that he can neither sell his goods abroad nor receive from abroad those goods that he needs. These are the two only ways of bringing pressure on a people, just as there are only two ways of compelling a fortress to surrender force and investment. So long as nations are unable to settle their disputes by peaceful methods, war must be the last resource; and if war is to be the method, what ethical distinction can be drawn between the two means of inducing surrender ?21. From the ethical point of view, what we always have insisted upon is that civilian life shall not be endangered and that neutral property shall be treated with the utmost possible consideration. In this respect maritime belligerent rights compare favourably with land and aerial warfare, which often involve incidentally the slaughter of civilians, the destruction of their homes and the displacement of vast populations to make room for military operations. As regards the claims of neutrals, we have never admitted that those whose main concern is to make money by supplying all the combatants with their needs (a commerce which may even give them an interest in the prolongation of hostilities), have a stronger ethical right than a people whose national existence is at stake. We see no moral reason why a belligerent which, by fighting and sacrifice, has won the supremacy of the sea, should forgo its advantages in their favour.&quot; The position assumed by England,&apos;.&apos; according to the Foreign Office Peace Handbook, &quot; may be stated very simply. Interference with neutral trade is justified whenever the premise on which the neutral claim rests unconcern with the war is negatived by the facts. When the neutral has established relations with the enemy his claim of absolute right is vitiated.&quot; (&quot; Freedom of the Seas,&quot; Chapter I, page 3.)And again, later-&quot; The occupation of the belligerent was war, that of the neutral was commerce. England, as belligerent, contended that the neutral had no right to do anything to help the enemy carry on the war; that, if he did help him, he must do it at his own risk.&quot;   (ibid., Chapter VI.)22. As regards the trend of public opinion in the United States, in certain quarters in the Dominions and to some extent in this country, it is observed that up to the present only one side of the case has been stated. It is thought by some that if the other side were put properly even the United States of America would see how much they have to lose from the surrender of belligerent rights. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs does not reject this possibility, though he is advised by the Foreign Office that they do not believe this to be the case in the present state of American opinion or without long and careful preparation. The more one studies, the conduct of nations the more does it become clear that their attitude towards the question of immunity of commerce is determined purely by their own situation and conditions, by the advantages they derive from immunity. National advantage, not a philosophic attitude towards war or humanity, was ever the spring of the policy of nations. As neutrals we see them advocate immunity to its utmost lengths. As belligerents, allied to strong Naval Powers, they advocate the strongest measures of coercion. America, as a neutral, disputed the legality of black-lists. When she became a belligerent her black-list was far more comprehensive than that of any of her European allies. It is possible that if the United States could be got to study-some of the problems which may confront them in the future, they would discover-their own need for the retention of belligerent rights, and this, perhaps, is the reason for the lukewarmness of the &apos;&apos; Big Navy &apos;&apos; Party on this particular proposal, of which we have some evidence.23. As regards the Dominions, all those who have commented on the subject of the renewal of the Arbitration Treaties have shown a sympathetic understanding[18907] c
of the difficulties arising in connection with this question; the replies especially from the Commonwealth, New Zealand and the Union of South Africa indicate a recogni-tion of the great importance of belligerent rights. So far as the trade of the Empire is carried, not in neutral but in British ships, the interests of all parts are identical (see paragraph 18 above), and we find it difficult to believe that, when the whole case is put, we should not be able to reach agreement with the Dominions. As regards our own people, we are satisfied that the case has only to be put before them to be understood.24. Such is the nature of the reply to the arguments in favour of low belligerent rights. The counter-argument in favour of high belligerent rights has been summed up tersely by the First Sea Lord and Chief of the Naval Staff as follows : &quot; If the power to enforce blockade were taken away from us, we had no means of ending a war except by raising an army on a continental scale.&quot;This thesis has been developed by Admiral Sir Herbert Richmond in a Memorandum from which the following is an extract: &quot;It is being suggested we should severely limit or give up our old rights of preventing trade between neutrals and the enemy. What this amounts to, in practice, is that we are to restrict our means of bringing pressure upon an enemy to the action of land forces or of air forces. As a member of a coalition of nations, we are to be debarred from exercising upon the enemy that pressure which results from stopping his oversea commerce. The possession of sea power under these conditions is, therefore, strictly restricted to enabling our army, or the armies of our allies, to cross the sea, and to prevent the enemy&apos;s armies from doing so. We, therefore, in a future great war, must be prepared to become a military Power, to raise large armies and to fight on land, or, as some will have it, to fight by destroying the towns, with their historic buildings and treasures of irreplaceable value, and killing the citizens of both sexes and all ages. While this is in progress the enemy is to be allowed the free use of the sea to refresh and maintain his national life. His industries are to continue to receive those raw materials they need, and he is free to export their products; and by thus keeping his commerce alive, he is to be enabled to maintain the financial means of continuing the war and to avert those social upheavals which result as they did in Russia and Germany, and came near to doing in Italy  in a crumbling of the powers of resistance.Whether at the present day any importance is attached to the weight which this country carries in the councils of the world I do not know. But it is quite obvious that, as Sir Julian Corbett remarked in 1917, &apos; since the influence of Naval power in the world is measured by the extent to which it can exercise command of the sea, every restriction in this direction tends to diminish the influence of the Naval Powers. And as it diminishes the influence of Naval Powers, so it gives fresh relative strength to the Military Powers.&apos;The most important wars are those in which some great principle is at stake such as freedom&apos; from the domination of some power or principle of Government and these have always been fought between great coalitions of Powers.In all of these the weapon which this country has primarily furnished to the common cause has been her Sea Power. The value of that power lay in the fact that it could not only maintain the financial strength of the coalition, but could weaken both the financial power and the resisting will of the enemy. Under the proposal to rescind the right of capture, we are to look upon war purely as a struggle between armies. We shall still be under the necessity of providing a navy stronger than our enemies, since without it we cannot defend ourselves against invasion, whether or no our trade was secured by international agreement. But, in addition, we must also provide a great army, and that army cannot move to aid our Allies without definite superiority at sea. If, therefore, we are to give assistance and support to a great cause, we must become at once both a naval and military Power. . . . We can defend ourselves, it is true, but this is not an active contribution to our allies, or to the attainment of the object for which we shall have gone to Avar.&quot;
25. The importance of maritime belligerent rights in our armoury is emphasized by a passage in the Annual Review for 1928 by the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee, which has received the approval of the Committee of Imperial Defence. After reviewing the present adequacy of the naval, military and air resources of the Empire for carrying out our various commitments, they make the following observation : &quot; Similarly, at a time when our power of bringing pressure to bear on an enemy by means of the fighting forces is reduced, we should view with dismay any international Agreement, such as that connoted in the expression &apos; Freedom of the Seas,&apos; which tended to limit the powers which our forces have exercised in the past. The aggregate of the fighting forces is so small in relation to our commitments that to-day, less than ever before, can we afford to make concessions in regard to the manner in which they have been used in the past to exert pressure on our enemies.&quot;26. It may be well to observe that, if we were to abandon our belligerent rights, we should be unable to give effective support to the sanctions provided by Article XVI of the Covenant of the League of Nations. To what extent and in what circumstances it may prove practicable to carry out Article XVI may be a matter of argument, but there is little doubt that it provides a powerful deterrent to an aggressor.27. In the space at our disposal we cannot discuss all the varying shades of definition of the term &quot; Freedom of the Seas.&quot; In its extreme form, as proposed by Colonel House in 1915, it signifies that every merchant ship, belligerent as well as neutral, shall be free from capture. It is only necessary to think for a moment to see the absurdity of this interpretation. It would mean that an invaded nation could not intercept on the high seas supplies for the enemy&apos;s invading army. Its own ships lying in harbour could be captured, by the advance of the invading army or destroyed by its artillery or aeroplanes, while the invader&apos;s ships at sea would be immune. This proposal would destroy the whole system of defence of the British Empire, which rests on the power of our Navy to intercept the supplies of any force which may be landed in any British Possession. Again, under this definition of Freedom of the Seas, the Central Powers could have imported everything they required in the late War. We could not even have blockaded the Turkish coast or German East Africa during our operations there. Such unbounded freedom would deprive belligerent, of all power to use our fleet as an economic weapon. But it is said that while this may be so, the fullest freedom is the only kind of freedom that can help Britain to obtain supplies. It is true that, short of such immunity, the British Empire would give up much and gain nothing, since British supplies of food and raw materials are carried so largely in British ships. But can it be reasonably contended that we could get this unrestricted freedom of the seas ? Moreover, even if it were conceivably possible to get an agreement based on complete freedom, would such an agreement ever be kept ? Would a nation fighting for its life refrain from touching its enemy&apos;s own ships ?At the other end of the scale lies Senator Borah&apos;s definition of Freedom of the Seas as &quot; The right of neutrals to carry commerce in war as freely as in peace, except when carrying actual munitions of war or seeking to break a blockade, which, however, must be of a kind sufficient to prevent the actual passage of ships.&quot; Between these extremes many, definitions of the Freedom of the Seas have been proposed.28. For the purposes of this Report it is sufficient to record that, agreeing with Lord Stowell that the object of war is to bring pressure upon the enemy, we consider that by abandoning maritime belligerent rights we should throw away one&apos; of our most potent weapons for achieving this object With the exception of Lord Cushendun, we are agreed in recommending that our policy should be based on the maintenance of belligerent rights as high as possible.[18907]
Part III.THE ATTITUDE OF THE UNITED STATES TOWARDS BELLIGERENT RIGHTS IN COMPARISON WITH OUR OWN.The American Attitude.29. Before setting forth our recommendations as to how belligerent rights can best be maintained at a high level, it is necessary to examine the American attitude towards this question. As a result of our efforts in this direction, we have come.to the conclusion that, although the Big Navy Party, and some thinkers outside it, are probably beginning to realise that the interests of the United States in future are likely to be best served by high belligerent rights, the trend of United States opinion, both in Congress and in the country, is in the opposite direction. It is true that in the war the United States co-operated in and reaped benefit from the exercise of high belligerent rights, and even that their action was in some respects more drastic than our own; that, in adopting a policy of low belligerent rights, they w^ould be going against the decisions of their own Prize Courts; and that the Havana Treaty of February 1928 (which, however, they have not yet ratified) does not endorse the immunity from capture of private property at sea. Nevertheless, the traditional view in favour of low belligerent rights represents the general view of the American people at the present moment. The strength of that view in Congress is illustrated by the almost unanimous acceptance of the Borah Resolution in the form set out later in paragraph 58 of this Report. Mr. Hoover&apos;s reported promise to take up the matter early indicates a real danger that he may commit himself to a standpoint from which he would be unable or unwilling to recede, and -which would make agreement difficult and perhaps impossible.30. Before we discuss the American views, so far as they are known, on the more technical aspects of maritime belligerent rights and compare them with our own, there is one more general question to which we must invite attention.31. &quot;Public&quot; and &quot;Private&quot; Wars.--In the course of the public discussions in magazines and the Press that have taken place recently on both sides of the Atlantic, a new theory has been evolved regarding the effect on the nature of war of the Pact for the Renunciation of War. While we do not hope that this theory will provide a solution of the belligerent rights difficulty, we feel that, in view of all that has been said upon the subject, we ought in this Report to take note of the difference between &apos;; public &quot; and &quot; private &quot; wars. The proposal is based on the suggestion that the Kellogg Pact has changed the whole situation in regard to war, and has opened a new era in international relations. The nations of the world, with the exception of the Argentine and Brazil, have pledged themselves to renounce war as an instrument of national policy. The only wars, then, in which it is said that the signatories of the Pact can become engaged are wars of defence against nations that have violated their engagements. War against such a State, which has broken faith with the whole world, so the argument runs, would be a &quot;: public &quot; war, fought in the interest of the good faith of the whole world. It is unthinkable that the nations of the world (even though they do not feel obliged to take part in the war) should succour an outlaw State. If they happen to be members of the League of Nations they would be bound, under Article XVI, to suspend relations with a declared aggressor. If they are not members of the League, the least they could do would be to allow the fullest exercise of maritime belligerent rights in order to end the war as soon as possible. Other wars, wdiich may for some reason or another break out in spite of the existence of international machinery to prevent them, are, under this proposal, to be deemed &quot; private &quot; wars. The more extreme advocates of the theory suggest that maritime belligerent rights should be abandoned for such wars, and a more moderate proposal is that they should be reduced to a lower level.32.   If the United States of America had become a member of the League of Nations there might be something to be said for the theory that all wars would be
: public &quot; wars.   From Colonel F ouse&apos;s Memoirs it appears that President Wilson at the Peace Conference had something of the kind in mind: &quot;Wilson explained his policy&quot; (i.e., of not pressing Freedom of the Seas at the Peace Conference) &quot; on the ground that there would be no more wars except those conducted by the League against an &apos; outlaw &apos; State, and therefore no neutrals. Hence the problem of the interference with neutral trade would not arise.&quot;   (The Intimate Papers of Colonel House, Vol. IV, p. 432.)The abstention, however, of the United States from the League invalidates the whole plan so far as they are concerned. To members of the League hostilities against a State that had been declared an aggressor might well be regarded as a &quot;public&quot; war; not so to the United States, which do not recognise the authority of the League. The Kellogg Pact does not adequately fill the gap because, though it renounces war, it provides no machinery for determining which State is the aggressor. Every State in the future, as in the past, will allege that its enemy is the aggressor, who has compelled it to fight a war of defence, and the League of Nations, the only tribunal which might possibly settle the matter, is not recognised by the United States.33. In these circumstances, it may very well be difficult to persuade the United States that an enemy has broken the Kellogg Pact. We feel, then, that the question of &apos;&apos; public&apos;&apos; and &apos;&apos; private&apos;&apos; wars would have to be treated with considerable discretion in any conversations or negotiations with the United States. We must, above all, avoid giving the impression that the first use we are making of the Kellogg Pact is to avoid any limitation of belligerent rights as exercised in the Great War by retaining the power to pronounce any war to be a &quot; public &apos;&apos; war. It is equally important to avoid giving the impression that the ulterior object of His Majesty&apos;s Government in Great Britain is to involve the United States in some commitment to take sanctions against a violator of the Kellogg Pact before public opinion in that country is ripe for such a step.34. Nevertheless, we think that in any negotiations it would be impossible, in view of the publicity that has been given to the proposal, to avoid mentioning the subject. Moreover, we think that it might have some educative effect in bringing American public opinion to realise the importance of high belligerent rights. We return to this question in paragraph 64. Here we will only say that it is probable that &quot; public &quot; wars would be the exception rather than the rule. Belligerent rights, therefore, must be discussed on the assumption that they may be used in ;&quot; private &quot; wars. Such wars may be waged either between individual Powers or between Powers with allies, either where the League of Nations Council has failed to reach agree-ment or where the members of the League are afraid to declare a Great Power to be the offender.35. In addition to &apos;&apos; public &apos;&apos; and &apos;&apos; private&apos;&apos; wars, a third category of belligerency has been proposed, under the heading &quot;Police measures,&quot; to include minor operations, such as the recent employment of American Marines in Nicaragua, the use of international forces in China, our own operations in the Aden territory, and so forth. In these cases narrow limitations of belligerent rights might well seem to the Americans to be as much out of place as it does to ourselves, and here again in considering these cases an educative effect may be hoped for as to the importance of our view of belligerent rights. In the next section of this Report we examine the British and American attitude towards some of the technical aspects of the application of belligerent rights at sea.British and American Views regarding the Application of MaritimeBelligerent Rights.36. For a detailed. comparison of British and American views regarding the application of maritime belligerent rights we are indebted to a Technical Sub-Committee under the Chairmanship of Sir Maurice Gwyer, His Majesty&apos;s Procurator-General and Treasury Solicitor. The subject was further explored by a Technical Committee under the Chairmanship of Sir Cecil Hurst, the Legal Adviser to the Foreign Office, whose task was to re-examine, for possible use in discreet conversations with United States officials, the ground covered in the Report just referred to and other papers, in order to see whether it was not possible to arrive at -a policy in connection with belligerent rights which would safeguard the essentials
of the Admiralty, and at the same time afford some reasonable prospect of an agreement with the United States. Both these Eeports are attached hereto (Appendices I and II).37. In pursuing their investigations the Hurst Sub-Committee used as a basis of their work the Declaration of London of 1909, which, though never ratified by this country, is an important landmark in the history of maritime law. They have done so because Senator Borah&apos;s Resolution in regard to belligerent rights, which at the time the Report was prepared had remained on the table of the Senate for ten months, had taken the Declaration as a point of departure, and because Sir Esme Howard had intimated in a private letter that this was the Senators intention. For the purposes of their Report the Sub-Committee, for reasons stated therein, limited their enquiry to the questions which might arise if Great Britain found herself at war with another State in circumstances which entail no breach of the Covenant on either side and therefore entitle other States members of the League to claim to adopt an attitude of neutrality. They accordingly take as a hypothetical case for the purposes of their enquiry a war between Great Britain alone and some other powerful European State alone, there being no allies on either side, a war in which the extent to which belligerent rights could be exercised by Great Britain would be very different from that to which she exercised them in the late war. On these assumptions the Sub-Committee have considered each of the matters dealt with in the Declaration of London in the light of the United States Naval Instructions of 1917 and of a Memorandum submitted by the United States Government to the London Conference of 1908-9 as embodying its views on the correct rules of international law relating to the various matters to be discussed at the Conference.&quot;8. The United States Naval Instructions of 1917,&quot; the Technical Sub-Committee^ Report explains, &apos;*&apos; are in this connection of particular importance. These instructions comprise rules covering practically all the matters dealt with in this Report. In the extent to which they recognise the right of the naval forces to exercise belligerent rights, they show an appreciable advance upon the standpoint adopted by the United States Government in the diplomatic notes exchanged during the war, and on many points they formulate rules on which it would be possible for the British Navy to act effectively in time of war. They thus provide a useful guide as to the view which the United States Govern-ment may be expected to maintain in any conference. Even if they were withdrawn by the United States Government, they would remain on record as the instructions which were in force for ten years during and after the war. No Government could maintain that the instructions it had issued to its own fleet and maintained in force for so long a time as ten years were contrary to international law.&quot;38. Great as is the importance of these considerations in arriving at an agree-ment with the United States Government, it is necessary to bear in mind that, at an International Conference, other Powers would have to be considered, and that there is a greater difference of view between continental nations and ourselves than between ourselves and the United States on this subject.39. Visit, Search and Detention (paragraphs 16 to 18 of the Technical Sub-Committee^ Report). The Technical Sub-Committee draw attention to a difference between British and American practice on this matter. Before 1914 there was no established practice of diverting neutral vessels from their course and holding them in port pending a decision. During the Great War, however, owing to the impossibility of making a thorough examination of a ship&apos;s cargo in the open sea where even boarding was often impossible or dangerous owing to the presence of submarines, this practice was adopted by the principal belligerents on both sides The United States, when neutral, denied the validity of this extension. Their.Naval Instructions of 1917 provide that the boarding officer shall first examine the ship s papers. If they furnish conclusive evidence of the innocent character of the vessel, cargo and voyage, the vessel shall be released; if they furnish probable cause for capture, she shall be seized and sent in for adjudication: &apos;&apos; If the papers do not furnish conclusive evidence of the innocent character of the vessel, the cargo, and voyage, or probable cause for capture, the boarding-officer shall continue the examination by questioning the personnel or by searching the vessel or by examining her cargo. If such further examination furnishes satisfactory evidence of innocency, the vessel shall be released. Otherwise she shall be seized and sent in for adjudication.&quot;
The difference, then, between the two practices is this: that the British divert into port any neutral vessel which cannot establish its innocency, as, for example, by some form of navicert, whereas the American regulations provide, in the first place, for some kind of actual examination at sea, though, if the ship cannot then establish innocency, it is seized and taken into port. In the second place, under the American rule the ship is sent in for Prize Court Adjudication, whereas under the British practice the decision as to Prize Court Proceedings is not taken until after the examination in harbour.40. The objection to the American rule is twofold. The Admiralty have a practical objection that it is impossible to examine a ship at sea with sufficient thoroughness to establish innocence or guilt, and that to attempt this in waters frequented by enemy submarines is dangerous. The second objection is the weight of responsibility which the adoption of this rule would impose upon the boarding officer. Every ship detained would have to be sent in for adjudication by the Prize Court, and since, if the Prize Court held that she was sent in without sufficient justification, a claim for heavy damages might follow, the boarding officer would always have before him the fear that his action might not receive the support of his Government. On the other hand, it is material to note that under American rule the vessel has always to prove her innocency, and unless the examination furnishes this evidence she is just as surely sent into port as under the British rule.41. We agree generally with the conclusions of the Technical Sub-Committee on this subject, particularly in regard to the importance of not excluding the use of extraneous evidence in effecting a capture; that the difference between the two Governments is not so much one of principle as in the application of a principle; that some form of navicert system is of importance in this matter and should be explored in any informal conversations between the two Governments; and that the difference between the British and American practice is mainly represented by the increased risk of claims for damages by neutral shipowners if the Prize Court should hold that their ships had been improperly detained and sent in for adjudication.42. Blockade (paragraphs 19 to 23 of the Sub-Committee&apos;s Report). We concur with the views of the Sub-Committee on this subject, and we note that the rules for blockade, as laid down in the United States Naval Instructions, are more satisfactory than those laid down in the Declaration of London.43. We think it right, however, to draw the attention of the Committee of Imperial Defence and the Cabinet to the fact that these rules would not enable us to carry out all the measures of economic pressure adopted during the Great War, many of which were imposed in retaliation for the enemy&apos;s illegal actions, and we are satisfied that it would be impossible to obtain the assent of an International Conference to the embodiment of these retaliatory measures as a legitimate extension of the right of blockade. One of the criticisms of the Declaration of London was that it weakened the effects of seapower by its failure to provide for the adaptation of the blockade rules to the conditions of modern naval warfare, and the same criticism might be directed against a Convention based on the Sub-Committee&apos;s proposals. In a future war many of the more drastic measures of 1914-18 could only be taken in retaliation for contravention of the laws of Avar by an enemy a matter to which we return later.44. Contraband (paragraphs 24 to 28 of the Sub-Committee&apos;s Report). We concur generally in the Report on the subject of contraband, and we take particular note that &quot; it would be possible for His Majesty&apos;s Government to achieve all that is necessary at the outset of a war on the basis of the existing American classifications.&quot; Nevertheless, Ave feel some doubts Avhether the United States Government would con-template adhering to their own list. They might find this particularly difficult.in the event of an International Conference on belligerent rights, especially if it were held in Washington. There is no doubt the nations that are consistent^ neutral, such as Holland, Denmark, and the smaller Continental PoAvers and probably the South American Republics, would wish to restrict the lists of contraband, an attitude Avhich it would not be easy for the Americans to resist. During the debate on the Cruiser Bill, Senator Borah is reported to have said : &quot; The enlargement of the contraband list by a belligerent was obnoxious to the idea of freedom of the seas, but it had been done in the Great War &quot;; but he proceeded to add : &quot; The United States had done so and would always do so again as long as the freedom of the seas question remained unsolved.&quot;  In view of the difficulty of blockade under modern conditions, except in
wars with very weak States, the contraband list becomes a matter of great importance. The list in the Declaration of London was based on the 17th Century list and was completely out of date. The vast extension of engines and materials of war in modern times necessitates a reasonably extensive list if it is to be of any value whatsoever. It is very desirable that we should obtain a list not lower than that provided for in the American Instructions.45. Unneutral Service. Destruction of Neutral Prizes (paragraphs 29 to 31 of the Sub-Committee&apos;s Report). We have no observations to make on the remarks of the Sub-Committee on these questions. Agreement would appear to be not impossible.46. Transfer of Flag. Enemy Character Defined (paragraphs 34 to 37 of the Sub-Cqmmittee&apos;s Report). We agree generally with the recommendations of the Technical Sub-Committee in regard to transfer of an enemy vessel to a neutral flag, whether effected before or after the outbreak of hostilities.In regard to the question of enemy character, it is laid down in the Declaration of London that, subject to the provisions respecting transfer to another flag, the neutral or enemy character of a vessel is determined by the flag which she is entitled to fly. Great Britain did not observe any such rule in its entirety in the late War, and reverted to the old English rule that the enemy flag is conclusive against the vessel, but the neutral flag is not conclusive against the captor. The Americans in their Instructions have adopted the rule of the Declaration of London, and a divergence with the United States over this question is not impossible. The difficulty is stated by the Technical Sub-Committee in the following terms: &quot; The practical importance of this question is whether it wrould enable any appreciable number of vessels to escape capture by the British naval forces where, without there having been any change of flag during the war, the vessels belong to subsidiary companies organised in neutral States by a corporation or individual in the enemy State.&quot;In order to assist us in determining whether this question was one on which it was vital for His Majesty&apos;s Government to insist on the maintenance of the rule followed during the War, we obtained a Joint Report from the Admiralty and Board of Trade. They are unable to say to what extent maritime countries at the present time run ships under the flag of another State in which they have subsidiary trading or shipping companies, but they report that there is an increasing tendency in this direction. They consider that the Covenant of the League of Nations and the Kellogg Pact have increased the delay likely to occur between the first indications of trouble and the outbreak of hostilities, and that such increased delay makes the likelihood of a change of flag greater, and that it would not always be possible to deal with such changes under Article 55 of the Declaration of London if it were in force. For these reasons they think that the rule should be that the character of the vessel* should depend upon the character of the controlling interest, as in the case of cargoes. They cannot tell us how much we should lose without this rule, because we have no real idea how much belonging to one country is invested in ships of another. They believe, however, that the rule is likely to be more important in the future than at present or in the past, and that, although there may not be a great amount of money on the whole invested in non-national ships, never -theless, we should abide by the principle, though it is possibly not a vital one in any discussions. Sir Charles Madden and Sir Charles Hipwood sum up by stating that in any discussion we should use this question of enemy character as a bargaining factor.   We accept these views.47. Evidence and Procedure in the Prize Courts (Admissibility of Extraneous Evidence) (paragraphs 38 to 44 and paragraph 57 of the Sub-Committee&apos;s Report).  We concur in the Report of the Sub-Committee on this subject, and we draw special attention to the following paragraphs referring to the admissibilityr of extraneous evidence :  &quot; 43. This question of the admissibility of extraneous evidence is one of the few points upon which Great Britain cannot give way, and if no basis of accord can be found with the United States, the question must be considered whether it is essential that the point should be covered in any agreement which is come to on the subject of belligerent rights, either in the form of a preliminary agreement with the United States or in a convention emerging from a conference.I.e., a vessel entitled to fly the neutral flag.
There seems a fair chance that if the British prize rules provided for the admissibility of extraneous evidence, and the right to use such evidence were disputed by a neutral Power and submitted as the result to international arbitration, His Majesty&apos;s Government would succeed in demonstrating that, under modern conditions, the refusal to admit extraneous evidence in determining the validity of the seizure was tantamount to denying the belligerent right of capture. The evidence establishing the destination would never, under modern conditions, accompany the ship or cargo. On the other hand, it is impossible to say that an international tribunal, whose bias might be in favour of the neutral claimants, would not decide that modern conditions did not justify any enlargement of the old belligerent right of capture, and that the rules, as laid down in Napoleonic times, admitted capture only where proof of destination accompanied the shipment.44. In view of the above, we recommend that this is a point which must be discussed with the United States Government, and every effort made to secure their acceptance of the view of the admissibility of extraneous evidence. If the effort fails, His Majesty&apos;s Government must then re-examine the situation and consider whether it is safe to allow an agreement to be concluded without mention of the question.&quot;We incline to the view that the Americans would find it difficult to exclude extraneous evidence, even under their own Instructions, and we think that a naval officer requiring proof of innocence could hardly be prevented from using extraneous evidence.48. Convoy (paragraphs 45 to 50 of the Sub-Committee&apos;s Report). The Technical Sub-Committee draw attention to the difficulties in regard to the right of convoy. The principle that neutral vessels under convoy of vessels of war are exempt from search was temporarily admitted by Great Britain in the unratified Declaration of London and by the United States Naval Instructions of 1917, subject to the safe-guards provided by the Declaration of London; that is to say, the Commander of the neutral convoy is bound to give the Commander of a belligerent warship all particulars as to the character of the vessels and cargoes which could be obtained by search; if the belligerent suspects that the confidence of the Commander of the convoy has been abused, he communicates his suspicions, and it is then for the Commander of the convoy, and for him alone, to investigate the matter, though he is bound to communicate a copy of his report to the Captain of the belligerent warship, and, if guilt is proved, to withdraw the protection of the convoy.49. In the light of our experience in the Great War this procedure is open to strong objections. With the right to convoy, the neutral Governments would be besieged by exporters wishing to take part in a lucrative business, and the neutral Government would be likely to accept the assurance of the exporters regarding the honesty of the consignees rather than the evidence of one of the belligerents. There are many dodges by which the exporters might get goods through to the enemy country which it would be difficult for their Governments to discover. Evidence against the goods carried would be very difficult to obtain prior to their arrival at their destination. During the late War we often had the barest suspicions about a cargo, and it Avas not until the Prize Court proceedings had developed that ave were able to prove, by means of the evidence which had by then been collected after seizure, or Avhicli became available in the course of the proceedings themselves, that the goods Avere destined for the enemy State. Another objection is that neutrals might not accept our list of contraband and their convoys might cover goods Avhich we had declared to be contraband.50. We feel that to trust to the responsibility of the Commander of the neutral Avarship would be most uncertain. It is true that in fact we could not stop a convoy escorted by an American warship except at the risk of going to Avar. Nevertheless the actual admission of the right of a neutral avarship to escort a convoy Avould be very formidable. It Avould be tantamount to an invitation to all neutral States to break the blockade. To give a free hand to every State of whatever size or respectability to escort convoys Avould involve such overAvhelming possible consequences that Ave hesitate to believe that American negotiators aa^ould face it. We doubt, therefore, whether the American rule avould survive discussion.[18907J ri
51. Examination of Mails (paragraphs 52 to 55 of the Sub-Committee^ Report). We concur with the general conclusions of the Sub-Committee on this question. The examination of mails, within such limits as are possible, is essential to Great Britain, because it is through such an examination that the evidence for Prize Courts is obtained, but we accept the opinion of the Sub-Committee that the point is not one on which it should be impossible to come to agreement with the United States.52. Retaliation (paragraph 56 of the Sub-Committee&apos;s Report). In discussing blockade (paragraphs 42 and 43) we have already drawn attention to the importance Of the right of retaliation. Without it we cannot exploit the advantages of sea-power to the full against an enemy which, as in the late War, has violated the laws of war and placed us at a disadvantage. The Technical Sub-Committee point Out that the only means by which this can be accomplished is to introduce a provision which will render the agreement inapplicable in case the rules of war are not observed by the other side.53. Armed Merchantmen.-We understand that no substantial difference exists between the Americans and ourselves on this question.Remarks.54. On the whole, the result of the above comparison indicates that the difference between the point of view of the Americans and ourselves on the questions dealt with in the Declaration of London, though not unimportant, may be less than we had anticipated at the outset of our Inquiry. It must be remembered, however, that this comparison is based on the assumption that the United States Government will adopt the same general standpoint as the)r have done in the past. If they should adopt the so-called Freedom of the Seas, or some low basis of belligerent rights (the possibility of which has already been discussed in paragraph 29) there would be no basis of agreement. In that event, however, the Americans must repudiate their Naval Instructions of 1917, following on the wdiole of their previous practice as belligerents. They would, we presume, seek to justify this by pointing out that these Instructions were drawn up at the time of their entry into the War; that the nations associated with them had already irretrievably compromised the situation by their blockade measures, and that they themselves had really no alternative but to co-operate a course to which they were reconciled by the fact that they had only entered the War owing to the flagrant breaches by the enemy of the laws of war; that now- the matter had to be considered not in an atmosphere of retaliation but of justice. Their case would certainly not appear to be a strong one, but the possibility of its being-advanced is by no means out of the question.55. Apart from the considerations discussed above, there are, as the Technical Sub-Committee state, a certain number of matters affecting the relations between belligerents and neutrals which lie outside the Declaration of London. From our point of view, the narrower the scope of any conference or conversations the better will our interests be served, and therefore there is no reason why our representatives should take the initiative in bringing up these subjects for discussion. Nevertheless, it is by no means unlikely that the Americans themselves, or, at a Conference, other Powers, might raise some of them, and our representatives ought to be aware of the view7s of His Majesty&apos;s Government With regard to each of them. Among them we may mention the right of visit, search and detention by submarines and aircraft; visit, search and detention of Government-owned vessels; submarine mines; belligerent warships in neutral ports ; materiel and personnel of a belligerent State salvaged or rescued at sea; conversion of merchant ships on the high seas or in neutral ports; the rule of the War of 1756; limits of the right of angary; radio-telegraphy; war zones; the test of enemy character of goods. We have not yet investigated in detail any of these matters, nor does the above list purport to be exhaustive. If desired, we are prepared to examine them and to deal with them in a third Report so that the Cabinet may have before them all aspects of the question. Our attention has also been drawn to such matters as the rationing of neutral nations, the navicert system and bunker control, as being liable to cause difficulties with neutrals in time of war; but since, in our view, these questions do not fall within the domain of international law, it would be impossible for any Conference to deal with them which had for its object the revision, or even the codification, of
international law. Nor have we attempted to deal with matters which exclusively affect the relations of belligerents inter se, since these appear to be outside the scope of our terms of reference. We refer, for example, to such topics as days of grace, sinking of enemy merchant ships, and the use of neutral flags by belligerent warships and merchant ships.56. Finally, when we consider the possibilities of agreement, we cannot exclude from view a subject that has only lately been raised, but which appears in the Senate&apos;s resolution quoted below in paragraph 58, namely, the immunity from capture of private property at sea. We cannot overload this long Report with a full dissertation on this question. The proposal was made at The Hague Conference of 1907, but although it obtained a majority of votes, it was not adopted. The fallacies underlying this proposal were exposed at the time by the late Admiral Mahan and Sir Julian Corbett in articles that have since been reproduced in the former&apos;s volume on &quot; Some Neglected Aspects of War.&quot;Part IV.CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS.57. Haying dealt in Part II with the larger question of policy and in Part III with the attitude of the United States, in comparison with our own, towards Belligerent Rights both as regards the principles and their application, we are now in a position to summarise our conclusions and recommendations on the question of what should be our attitude towards an International Conference or conversations or negotiations with the United States Government.58. Throughout our inquiry we have had to consider whether a Conference would be to our advantage or not. As time went on, the probability that the Americans would take the initiative in summoning a Conference increased. During the discussions in the American Senate on the Cruiser programme, as Sir Esme Howard had warned us was likely to be the case, a strong opinion was developing in favour of the adoption of a resolution asking the President of the United States of America to summon an International Conference for the purpose of a &quot; restatement and codification of the rules of law governing the conduct of belligerents and neutrals in war at sea.&quot; At the last moment, however the Senate changed its plans and the resolution was converted into an amendment to the Naval Construction Bill and assumed the following form :  First, that Congress favours a Treaty or Treaties with all principal maritime nations regulating the conduct of belligerents and neutrals in war at sea, including the inviolability of private property thereon. Second, that such Treaties be negotiated, if practically possible, prior to the meeting of the Conference on Limitation of Armaments in 1931.This amendment, which was proposed by Senator Reed of Missouri, was passed with the Bill that has now become law. The amendment, however, merely expresses the view of Congress that Treaties on this subject should be negotiated, &quot; if practically possible,&quot; and is not mandatory upon the President, who remains free to act upon this advice or not, as he thinks fit.59. The principal argument in favour of a Conference on this subject is that if a settlement could be arranged, not only should we dispose of a difficulty that is claimed to be at the root of both the Cruiser problem and the Arbitration Treaty (which, apart from belligerent rights, are the only serious outstanding points between the United States of America and ourselves), but we should also secure ourselves against the risk of interference in a future war. To obtain this latter result it has been urged that it would be worth while for us to make considerable concessions. Suppose, for example, that we could secure by agreement 75 per cent, of the belligerent rights we exercised in the Great War, it would be well worth while to abandon 25 per cent, of our claims. The alternative of going without a settlement and leaving the problem to be settled when the emergency arose might be to place ourselves in the dilemma of having to abandon the whole or risk bringing the United States of America into the war against us.60.   We found, however, that strong reasons could be urged against a Conference.    The late Lord Cave&apos;s Committee,  which considered the whole [18907] d 2
question very carefully just after the War, reached a definite conclusion that the discussion of questions relating to maritime belligerent rights should, if possible, be postponed, and that was the trend of opinion at the Imperial War Cabinet between the armistice and the Peace Conference. At the present time the reasons against a Conference may be summarised as follows :  (1.) The laws of war as they exist at present are only in a small measure the result of definite international treaties. The great body of international law in this sphere is merely the expression of the fact that certain principles, and in a less degree particular applications of them, have in course of time come to be generally accepted. To reduce to the rigidity of a detailed code this necessarily elastic and developing system is to court certain failure. It is as impossible to-day to foresee the conditions and developments of the future as it would have been at the close of the Napoleonic wars to forecast the weapons, methods and conditions of the Great War. A code made in such ignorance of the conditions in which it will be invoked is certain to be inapplicable and to become a dead letter.(2.) It is in the interest of the Empire that belligerent rights should be kept as high as possible,(3.) The present trend of opinion in the United States is favourable to drastic limitation of the rights of a belligerent to intercept private property at sea, and in such a conference this tendency would be irresistibly strengthened by the support of the Scandinavian and other Powers, including, perhaps, Italy. In these conditions and in the present circumstances it is very doubtful whether the United States would take their own naval instructions as a basis for codification.(4.) No agreement for codification could in any case be reached without con-cessions being made by both sides from extremes of high and low belligerent rights, and a compromise of this kind, even if reached by the two Governments, is likely to be repudiated either by Congress or Parliament or both.(5.) There is a serious risk that any agreement reached with the United States in the present state of public opinion in that country would have the effect of curtailing the field of action open to members of the League under Article 16, or Great Britain under the Locarno Treaty and other Treaty obligations.(6.) There is at present a movement in the United States towards a recognition of the corporate responsibility of nations for the imposition of sanctions against a violation of the Kellogg Pact; an international agreement on maritime law, by crystallising the old conception of belligerency or neutrality, would have the effect of arresting the growth of this new-conception of corporate national responsibility not only in the United States itself, but throughout the world.61. The proposal set forth in the Resolution passed in the United States Senate (paragraph 58) for separate Treaties with the principal maritime nations appears to us to offer no advantages, since it could not achieve codification, while it would be open to all the objections of disagreement.62. At the moment when our first Report on Arbitration Treaties was being compiled, information was received from Sir Esme Howard to the effect that Mr. Hoover, the President-Elect, had intimated to Senator Borah (Chairman oi the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations) that he intended to take up the question of codifying maritime law at an early date and that he was personally anxious to get a settlement. After consulting the Sub-Committee, Sir Austen Chamberlain replied by instructing Sir Esme Howard to communicate confidentially to Mr. Hoover, either directly or through the State Department, the reasons for which His Majesty s Government deprecate the issue of invitations to a Conference at an early date, and, above all, without their having been given an opportunity of discussing the matter fully and confidentially with the United States Government before a decision taken.63. Having thus taken steps to deter the United States Government from undue precipitation, we had to consider, in the light of the recent Senate Resolution and the present agitation in the United States, the question how can a Conference be avoided %
64. In the first instance, by explaining to Mr. Hoover the serious risks of disagreement and by pointing out that at any such conference the question of the distinction between public and private wars is bound to come up and with it a perfectly logical demand that the United States should at least remain passive in face of a rigorous application of economic sanctions against an acknowledged violator of the Kellogg Pact. The following point could, indeed, be put to the United States Government with some force : What is presumably suggested by those who favour a conference is the formulation of a code of general application governing belligerent and neutral rights at sea ; in other words, a code which is to be applicable in all future wars. This has been the object of all past attempts to codify this branch of inter-national law, and it is necessarily based on the theory, which will be found in all the text books, that whatever the rights and wrongs of the war and the merits and demerits of the belligerents, the rights of belligerents and neutrals are unaffected thereby. This is, in fact, the 19th century doctrine of neutrality, and it is really based on the view which has prevailed until recently that any State is entitled to go to war in support of its national policy if it thinks fit to do so. But how can the nation which has produced the Kellogg Pact contend that this is the state of affairs to-day? The object of the Kellogg Pact is to abolish the legitimacy of war as an instrument of national policy, and to ensure that, if war occurs at all, the country which goes to war in support of its national policy will be universally regarded as having done something which is wrong and as having violated a solemn international obligation. Is it, there-fore, conceivable that the United States should seriously propose that, in the event of war breaking out in consequence of a violation by one Power of the Kellogg Pact, that Power should be entitled to exercise the rights of belligerents, and that States which may desire to trade with it should be entitled to claim the rights which were conceded to neutrals, under the old state of affairs? But if a code of general application is adopted this is exactly what would happen, and such a state of affairs is surely more likely to lead to trouble between the &apos; innocent party &apos; to the war and neutrals than anything else.&quot;These are possibilities and considerations which Mr. Hoover&apos;s Administration will be unable to brush aside or ignore.65. Nevertheless, the Foreign Office believe that something more will be necessary to avoid the summoning of a Conference. It is their considered opinion that, apart from representations in the above sense, the only means by which we can hope to avoid a conference in present circumstances are (1) the early conclusion of an arbitration treaty containing no reservations in regard to belligerent rights (as recommended by the majority in our first Report dealing with the draft Arbitration Treaty with the United States); and (2) the early conclusion of an Anglo-American agreement, or, if that be impossible, a modus vivendi with regard to the limitation of naval armament.The Admiralty, however, hold that the conclusion of an Arbitration Treaty as in (i) would endanger in war and, perhaps in the long run, destroy our belligerent rights, being convinced that a body constituted like the Permanent Court of Inter-national Justice which, moreover, in war, would contain many biassed neutrals  would give an adverse decision on rights exercised by the Allies in the Great War and essential in a future important war.We forbear to discuss this question, which has already been fully dealt with in our first Report on the renewal of Arbitration Treaties, and on which we have been unable to reach agreement.66. Assuming, however, that for one reason or another the summoning of an International Conference on this subject or the negotiation of separate treaties in accordance with the Senate&apos;s resolution quoted in paragraph 58, which might have substantially the same effect, should prove to be inevitable, what will be the best procedure ?67. Firstly, an endeavour should be made to enter into private and confidential discussions with the United States Government in the hope of persuading them to conclude a separate treaty in the first instance with this country on the basis of their existing naval instructions.
68. Should this prove impossible, an attempt should be made to secure the limitation of the Conference to the five Great Naval Powers for the reason that in a conference composed in this manner we should hope to gain a certain amount of support to our policy of high belligerent rights, and at any rate the number of Powers arrayed against us would be smaller than at a Conference at which the lesser States were also represented.In any event, an endeavour should be made to enter into private and confidential conversations with the United States Government, in the hope of harmonising beforehand, as far as possible, the views of the two Governments. In any case, also, it should be made quite clear to the United States Government that this country will refuse to enter upon any negotiations or conferences having for their object a revision as opposed to a recodification of maritime law. By &quot; codification &quot; is meant the codification of the alleged existing rules of maritime law and the bringing of the recognised principles of international law, as shown in the customary law, up to date and into harmony, so that the ideas emerging from the principles may be formulated in articles which have some relation to modern conditions and modern war practices.Beyond this point it is difficult to define in advance what will be the best procedure, since this must necessarily depend on the course of subsequent events and, in particular, on the attitude assumed by the United States Government.69. But whether it is ultimately found possible to avoid a Conference or not, it is essential that on a matter of such importance as belligerent rights we should reach complete agreement with the Dominions as to the policy to be pursued, either by means of correspondence or by discussion at an Imperial Conference. For reasons which we indicate in paragraph 23 above, we do not anticipate that there will be any insuperable difficulty in bringing into complete agreement, which is essential, the views of the various parts of the Empire on this issue.SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS. General Policy.70. (a.) Our policy should be based on the assumption that belligerent rights must be maintained as high as possible.(Lord Cushendun is unable to accept this assumption.)American Opinion.(6.) Although the &quot; Big Navy &quot; Party and some thinkers outside it are probably beginning to realise that the interests of the United States of America in future are likely best to be served by high belligerent rights, the undoubted trend of American opinion at the present time, both in Congress and in the country, is in the direction of the traditional view in favour of low belligerent rights.(c.) The theory that belligerent rights might be agreed to in a higher form for &quot; public &quot; wars of defence against nations that have violated the Kellogg Pact than in &quot; private &quot; wars, is not likely to provide a solution of the problem. Nevertheless, in view of the wide publicity that has been given to this proposal, it would have to be raised in any conversations with the Americans, which might conveniently be done as suggested in paragraph 64.(d.) A suitable opportunity might also be taken of referring to police measures and the standard of belligerent rights that these might require.(e.) Provided that the Americans base themselves on their own Naval Instructions of 1917, there is a reasonable prospect of reaching agreement with them on most of the questions of maritime belligerent rights dealt with in the Declaration of London. It is doubtful, however, whether the United States would defend their own Naval Instructions as a basis for agreement. Moreover, discussions would probably be extended to matters lying outside the scope of the Declaration of London, including the doctrine of the immunity from capture of private property at sea, and in some of these matters the difficulty of reaching agreement would be very great.
Attitude towards an International Conference.(/.) Having regard to the above, we certainly could not count on reaching agree-ment acceptable to ourselves even with America. At an International Conference the difficulties would be even greater, owing to the attitude of some Continental Powers. In these circumstances it is very desirable, if possible, to avert an International Conference.(g.) The alternative to an International Conference suggested in the American SenatVs Resolution set forth in paragraph 58 in favour of separate agreements with the principal maritime Powers on the subject of belligerent rights is open to at least as much objection as an International Conference.(h.) In order to avert an International Conference steps should be taken to explain to Mr. Hoover the serious risks of disagreement and the other objections to the Conference set forth in paragraph 64. The Foreign Office consider that, in addition, the only means by which we can hope to avoid a Conference in present circumstances are (i) The early conclusion of an Arbitration Treaty containing no reservations in regard to belligerent rights; and(ii) The early conclusion of an Anglo-American agreement, or, if that be impossiblej a modus vivendi with regard to the limitation of naval armament.The Admiralty, however, hold that the conclusion of an Arbitration Treaty as in (i) would endanger in war, and perhaps in the long run destroy, our belligerent rights, being convinced that a body constituted like the Permanent Court of International Justice which, moreover, in war would contain many biassed neutrals  would give an adverse decision on rights exercised by the Allies in the Great War and essential in a future important war.(i.) Finally, rather than take part in an International Conference we should be prepared to enter into a Treaty with the United States on the basis of their existing Naval Instructions.(;.) If an International Conference should prove unavoidable, a Conference composed of the five great Naval Powers would be preferable.(k.) In either event an endeavour should be made to enter into private and confidential conversations with the United States Government in the hope of harmonising beforehand, as far as possible, the views of the two Governments. In any case it should be made clear to the United States Government that this country will refuse to enter upon any negotiations or Conference having for their object a revision as opposed to a recodification of maritime law.Dominions and India.(I.) Before action of any kind is taken, the consent of the Dominions and India should be obtained to the policy set forth in this Report, or as near to it as possible. In any case full agreement as to our policy on belligerent rights should be secured with them before we enter upon any Conference.Signed on behalf of the Sub-Committee,SALISBURY (Chairman).2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1, March 6, 1929.
APPENDIX No. I.(B.R. 20.)Note by the Procurator-General.IN accordance with the decision of the Sub-Committee on Belligerent Rights at the second Meeting, held on the 6th February, 1928 (B.R. 2nd Minutes, Conclusion 2), the annexed Memorandum has been prepared after consultation with representatives of the Admiralty and the Foreign Office, who were designated for the purpose by the Sub-Committee. It has been read and approved by the Attorney-General.The Memorandum deals with the various belligerent rights in the order adopted by the Admiralty memorandum on the same subject (Paper No. B.R. 14).It will be seen that the differences which exist between His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment and the United States are not so much with regard to basic principles of international law as with regard to the application of those principles to the changed circumstances of modern naval warfare. It may, indeed, be almost said that the only matter on which an absolute divergence of principle is known to exist is with regard to the right to visit and search ships in convoy, but in any future naval war this question, which did not substantially arise between 1914 and 1918, might well become of the first importance.Subject to the above, and ignoring the possibility that the United States policy is to secure the exemption of private property from capture at sea by a complete rewriting of international law on the subject, it would seem not impossible to secure agreement with the United States on broad questions of general principle; but agreement on the scope and application of those principles seems likely to be more difficult if only for the reason that it is impossible to foresee in any given case the particular state of facts on which the question of principle would be invoked. It should also be borne in mind that the &apos;&apos; American view &apos;&apos; of these questions may be liable to vary according as it is based on (1) the American Prize Court decisions (of which there are none of importance since the Civil War), (2) the policy of the Navy Department, and (3) the views of the State Department as to existing inter-national law. It may be thought that the United States, when their naval staff have had time to think the matter out, would be unwilling to obstruct the fullest exercise of belligerent rights by their Navy in time of war; but it does not follow that their interpretation of those rights, and of the manner in which they can legitimately be exercised, would be the same at a time when the United States were themselves neutrals.It is thought that the statement could not usefully indicate which belligerent rights must be considered essential as opposed to those which, though desirable, are not vital to British, interests. An expression of opinion on a matter of this kind would seem to be more appropriately embodied in a separate statement prepared by the Admiralty themselves; but in some cases attention has been called to the importance of a particular point from the legal aspect.(Signed) M. L. GWYER.Storey&apos;s Gate, S.W.1, March 12, 1928.[18907]
Memorandum.(a) and (b). Visit, Search and &quot; Detention.&quot;1. &quot; Visit and Search &quot; is the traditional name for the process whereby a belligerent ascertains whether a vessel and/or cargo can be legally captured. The right of a belligerent to subject a vessel to visit and search is beyond doubt. The mode of exercising it is a matter of dispute.2. Before 1914 it was the generally accepted rule that the decision as to capture and the capture should be made at sea. During the war, however, the practice was adopted of diverting to a British port, without any preliminary examination, all vessels proceeding up-channel or north of Scotland. At that port the vessel was placed in the custody of the Customs. The Customs carried out such physical search as was considered necessary. Particulars as to the vessel and her cargo were telegraphed to London for consideration by the Contraband Committee. The decision whether the vessel and/or any part of her cargo was to be seized was telegraphed to the Customs, and it was only on receipt of such instructions by the Customs at the port where the vessel lay that it or its cargo or part cargo was seized as Prize. Pending the receipt of instructions from London, the vessel was described as being &quot; under detention.&quot;3. There is no right of diversion and detention as such. The diversion of vessels into port, and their detention there while a belligerent, decides whether or not to seize them as Prize are justifiable only as being necessarily incident to the exercise under modern conditions of the admitted right of-visit and search.4. During the war, France, Germany and Italy all adopted the practice of diverting vessels into port for examination there.5. The United States asserted during the period of their neutrality (a) that search must be made on the high seas, and (b) that in deciding whether or not to seize as Prize the belligerent must have regard solely to such evidence as was revealed by the examination of the ship and her papers.6. His Majesty&apos;s Government contended (a) that an effective physical search on the high seas was impracticable, and (&amp;) that a belligerent was entitled, in deciding whether or not to seize as Prize, to have regard to all the information in his possession, however obtained, and that accordingly, in most cases, the decision whether a ship was to be seized as Prize could not be taken until after her arrival in port. The bulk of the diplomatic discussion was concerned with the first point.  It is, however, the second which raises the real question of principle.7. Neutral vessels were not sent into British ports and there held primarily for the purpose of facilitating physical search. They were held in order that the Contraband Committee might, with particulars of the vessel and her cargo before it, examine such information as it was able to collect from any source with regard to the shipowners, charterers, shippers and receivers of the goods, &amp;c. In the case of vessels bound for neutral ports, visit and search and examination of papers on the high seas can, In the ordinary case, reveal nothing. The decision whether the vessel, or any part of her cargo, should be seized must be based upon extraneous evidence, and must accordingly be made by persons on shore and in a position to collect and examine all relevant information.8.   To sum up : -(1.) During the war the right of visit and search was exercised in a novel form. (2.) There was before 1914 no established practice of diverting neutral vesselsfrom their course and holding them in port pending a decision.  It was,however, adopted by the principal Naval belligerents on both sides. (3.) It is impossible to control supplies to the enemy through adjacent neutral countries without extending the right of visit and search so as to includethe right of detaining pending enquiry. (4.) The United States as neutrals denied the validity of this extension, andtheir Naval Instructions of June 1917 indicate that they adhere to this attitude.(c.) Seizure.9. The right of seizing vessels and their cargoes with a view to claiming their condemnation by a competent Court of Prize in accordance with the recognised principles of international law is undisputed.
(d.) Blockade.10. The right of blockade is the right to prevent, by means of warships, access to or departure from a defined part of the enemy&apos;s coast. In order to be binding a blockade must be effective, i.e., it must be maintained by a force sufficient to render hazardous such access or departure. Breach of a blockade of this kind alone is a ground for the condemnation of the ship and cargo.11. No such blockade was declared and enforced by His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment or their Allies in the waters of Western Europe during the war; but several blockades of this description were declared and enforced in other theatres.12. The right of blockade is undisputed, but difficulties arise as to (1) the application of the doctrine of continuous voyage to blockade (this is dealt with below), and (2) the question whether the blockading force may be stationed at a distance from the blockaded coast. The United States were disposed to admit the latter in the diplomatic correspondence during the war.13.  In considering the question of &quot; blockade,&quot; confusion arises in two ways : (1.) The term was often employed (as, e.g,, in the Armistice conditions) as a convenient short description of all the measures taken to exert economic pressure on Germany.(2.) The measures announced by the Order in Council of the 11th March, 1915 (the first retaliatory Order in Council), were, in the first instance, described as a blockade by His Majesty&apos;s Government and discussed as such in the correspondence between His Majesty&apos;s Government and the United States. When, however, the validity of these measures was argued in the Prize Court and the Privy Council, they were justified solely on the ground that they were legitimate acts of retaliation, and it was not sought to defend them as a blockade. To have defended them as such would have involved the assertion that the doctrine of continuous voyage is applicable to blockade.(e.) Contraband.14. For the purpose of applying the law of contraband, International Law divides goods into three classes : (1.) Goods exclusively used for warlike purposes (absolute contraband).(2.) Goods which may be used for either warlike or peaceful purposes(conditional contraband). (3.) Goods which are exclusively used for peaceful purposes.15. Absolute contraband is liable to condemnation on proof that it is going to the enemy country.16. For the condemnation of conditional contraband proof is required, not merely that it is going to the enemy country, but that it is going there to be used for military purposes. This may be taken to mean for use by the enemy Government or its armed forces.17. As to the articles which fall within any one of the three categories mentioned above, there has never been any general rule. Belligerents have always sought to enlarge the first class at the expense of the second, and the second at the expense of the third, and neutrals have always objected, and it may be assumed that this will be so in the future. The Declaration of London sought to resolve these differences by defining certain articles as being absolute, certain others as being conditional contraband (subject in each case to the right of a belligerent to extend the list), and by declaring that certain other articles could not be declared to be contraband at all.18. The Declaration of London lists were not adopted by His Majesty&apos;s Government. The contraband list was the subject of frequent alterations, and the final list of 2-7-17 was of an extraordinarily comprehensive character.19. The distinction between absolute and conditional contraband was (at all events formally) observed in practice. A Foreign Office publication of 13-4-16 stating all the articles on the list of contraband seemed to indicate that it was the intention of His Majesty&apos;s Government to treat the distinction as inoperative. The view expressed in that publication was, however, never put forward in the Prize Court.[18907]
20. The observance by the Prize Court of the principle became, however, little more than formal, and few instances are known of consignments of any size of goods on the conditional contraband list found to be destined for an enemy country which escaped condemnation on the ground that there was no evidence that they were destined for the enemy Government or its armed forces.21. The United States twice at least indicated their intention of questioning the validity of the contraband list. No protest was in fact received. The Memorandum of the views of the United States presented at the London Conference asserted the right of a belligerent to modify the contraband list.22. The differences between His Majesty&apos;s Government and the United States as to the treatment of contraband are not differences of principle. The objections taken were to the applications of the principles and in particular to the rules of evidence adopted by the Prize Court (as to this point see paragraphs 28 to 39 below).(f.) Un-neutral Service.23. The &quot; right to prevent un-neutral service,&quot; or rather the right to punish by condemnation neutral vessels which have engaged in such service, is fully recognised in International Law. During the war the British Prize Courts had not to deal with many cases of un-neutral service, and it is not thought that their decisions went beyond the rules which would be generally admitted and which were embodied in Articles 45 and 46 of the Declaration of London. Speaking generally, therefore, it is not considered that this question is likely to give rise to difficulties, but points which must be regarded as still to some extent unsettled are : (1) The removal of persons belonging to the armed forces of the enemy from a neutral ship, even though the circumstances are not such as to justify the capture of the ship (this was allowed by Article 47 of the Declaration of London); (2) the removal from a neutral ship of enemy agents who are not members of the armed forces, or the liability of the ship to condemnation by reason of the carriage of such persons; this question was the subject of controversy with the United States during the war in the case of the &quot; China,&quot; when the enemy agents Avere ultimately released.(g.) The Doctrine of Continuous Voyage or ultimate Destination. (1.) Contraband.24. According to the doctrine of continuous voyage (or, as it is sometimes called, of ultimate destination), the mere fact that goods which could be shown to have ultimate enemy destination Avere to be discharged from the carrying a^essel at an intermediate neutral port does not exempt them from seizure. At the time of the London Naval Conference of 1909, the application of the doctrine to contraband was still a subject of dispute. In the Declaration of London a compromise was reached by applying the doctrine to absolute but not to conditional contraband. During the war the British Prize Courts held that, in relation to contraband, the doctrine had become part of the laAV of nations at the commencement of the avar.25. The United States are fully committed to the application of the doctrine to contraband. This application was first made by their Prize Courts during the Civil War and it is fully recognised in their Naval Instructions of 1917. Although there is a lack of definite evidence as to modern Continental opinion, it is thought that it may reasonably be assumed that the application of the doctrine both to absolute and conditional contraband may now be regarded as forming part of established international law. But difficulties may, of course, arise as to the evidence which is necessary to justify the application of the doctrine to particular shipments; according to the English decisions during the war it is the intention of the person who at the time of seizure is in a position to control the destination which is really material, but it is not certain that the United States or an international tribunal might not hold that it is necessary to establish an intention on the part of the shippers that the goods should reach the enemy.(2.) Blockade.26. This question forms the subject of a recent Report of the Legal Sub-Committee of the Advisory Committee on Trading and Blockade in Time of War (Paper No. L.C. 28), to which reference may be made, as it is difficult to deal avith the matter briefly.  As no blockade (in the technical sense) of Germany Avas declared
during the war, no case arose in which the British Prize Courts were invited to apply the doctrine of Continuous Voyage to blockade, and it is at present impossible to say what view they would take of such an application. The Continental view may be assumed, at any rate at present, to be opposed to the application of the doctrine to blockade, and it is certainly impossible to say that such application is generally recognised by international law.27. The position of the United States in this respect is somewhat peculiar. The only cases in which it can be said that the doctrine of Continuous Voyage has been applied to blockade are certain decisions of the American Prize Courts in the Civil War, and the United States was the only country which, at the London Conference, made any attempt to uphold such application. To this extent it may be said that the United States have favoured the claim which the Admiralty desire to make, but it is important to bear in mind (1) that the Civil War decisions referred to are distinctly obscure, (2) that the American delegates did not insist on their original position at the London Naval Conference and it is not maintained in their 1917 Instructions, and (3) that during the Civil War their Prize Court expressly declined to apply the doctrine to cases where the subsequent transportation was to be by land, and that therefore there are no American authorities which could be cited in favour of an attempt to apply the doctrine to the carriage of goods to a European port with the intention that they should be forwarded by land to some other European country.(h.) Evidence and Procedure.28. New Prize Court Rules which had been under consideration for some time were issued after the outbreak of war. They effected a substantial change in the procedure of the Court.29. Under the old procedure, there was a preliminary hearing, at which the only evidence admissible was that derived from an examination of the captured ship and of her papers and from Interrogatories (of a standardised and exceedingly elaborate nature) administered to the Captain and/or members of the crew.30. If upon this evidence at the preliminary hearing the case was clear, con-condemnation or restitution was decreed at once. If, however, the case was left in doubt &quot;further proof &quot; was allowed, i.e., either the claimants or the captors were allowed to produce further evidence in resolution of the doubt. This opportunity was allowed more readily to claimants than to captors. On the production of such further evidence there was a second hearing and a final decree.31. This was also the United States procedure, and it is believed that the Con-continental system was not dissimilar.32. The Rules of 1914 abolished entirely the preliminary hearing. They assimilated the procedure in Prize to the modern procedure in ordinary civil causes and proAdded that &apos;&apos; the causes .... shall be heard upon the affidavit as to ship papers, and the ship papers, if any, exhibited thereto either alone or upon such other evidence as the Judge may direct.&quot; In fact, the widest latitude was permitted both to the Crown and the claimants in the admission of evidence, and objection was rarely, if ever, taken to the admissibility or form of any evidence tendered.33. The practice of the French, German and Italian Courts during the war seems to have been assimilated to that of this country.34. The United States objected (1) to the abolition under the new Rules of the preliminary hearing with its limitation of the evidence admitted, and (2) to the pro-visions of certain Orders in Council under which in certain circumstances, e.g., where goods were consigned &quot; to order,&quot; the onus of proof was on claimants to prove their goods innocent of an enemy destination.35. The first objection was bound up avith the American contentions with regard to visit and search mentioned in paragraphs 1 to 8 above^e. The maintenance of their attitude on these matters involves of necessity the proposition that, even if a belligerent is possessed of positive evidence that goods of a contraband nature, though documented for discharge in a neutral port, are, in fact, the property of and destined for an enemy Government, cannot be seized and/or condemned.36. It is to be noted that the United States contention was not that extraneous evidence was never permissible, but that His Majesty&apos;s Government were not entitled to use it in deciding Avhether or not to seize, and could only pray it in aid if and Avhen the Court, after a preliminary hearing confined to evidence derived from the ship and the Interrogatories, was left in doubt.
37. The objection taken to the establishment of presumptions against claimants by Orders in Council was one of form rather than substance. It may be regarded as reasonably certain that the Prize Court would as an ordinary matter of evidence have regarded the onus as being on the claimants in the circumstances contemplated by the Orders in Council, and from the point of view of the Crown they were probably unnecessary.38. Imports of a particular kind of goods into a neutral country shown to be markedly in excess of imports in pre-war years, combined with the existence of an export trade from that country to an enemy country, were regarded by the Prize Court as creating a presumption of enemy destination against any particular ship-ment of that class of goods. The United States objected to the validity of this statistical argument. Their objection was, in fact, inconsistent with the view taken by their own Courts of similar facts less precisely proved during the Civil War.39. In circumstances similar to those of the late war, the unfettered use of extraneous evidence would probably again be vital if effective pressure is to be put upon the enemy. The United States must be regarded as still denying the legitimacy of the use of such evidence, but the grounds of their objection are of a purely technical character and are unlikely to stand the test of practice.(i.) The Right to Examine Ships under Convoy of Neutral Warships.40. British practice has always upheld this right, but it has been disputed for more than a century; at the London Naval Conference the only other country which did not in terms reject it was Germany, and it was abandoned in Articles 61 and 62 of the Declaration of London. The United States, at any rate since 1909, must be taken to be definitely opposed to the claim in question, though their Naval Instruc-tions recognise, as does Article 62 of the Declaration of London, that the convoying State is under some degree of responsibility as to satisfying itself of the innocence of the shipments convoyed. In these circumstances it is not possible to regard the claim as sanctioned by international law, but in view of the difficulty, in modern conditions, of the convoying State satisfying itself of the innocent destination of the convoyed cargoes, it is plain that the admission of the right of convoy might seriously prejudice the exercise of belligerent rights at sea.(j.) Censorship of Mails and Seditious Literature.41. Before 1907 no general rule existed as to the right of a belligerent to interfere with mails. The trend of opinion, however, was towards treating them as exempt from all interference. There is no instance before 1914 of a belligerent claiming the right to open letters in mails found on the high seas.42. In 1907 His Majesty&apos;s Government became party to a Convention (Hague Convention No. XI) which provided inter alia that &quot; the postal correspondence of neutrals or belligerents, whether official or private in character, which may be found on board a neutral or enemy ship at sea is inviolable.&quot; None of the belligerents observed this Convention in the sense of treating it as precluding them from opening and examining private mails found on the high seas.43. Before March 1916 His Majesty&apos;s Government did not interfere at all with any mails, except those which in one form or another came voluntarily into a British port. So far as such mails are concerned, His Majesty5s Government were, of course, entitled to exercise such rights as were available to them under their own municipal law. After March 1916 the mails of vessels brought from the high seas within the jurisdiction by force were examined.44. The only ground on which the opening and examination of such letters can be justified is as an exercise of the right of search for the purpose of deciding whether the contents are liable to condemnation. It follows, therefore, that there is, strictly speaking, no belligerent right of censorship as such. The fact that a belligerent is entitled to open letters provides him with an opportunity of making and keeping a copy of the contents of such letters as he cannot claim to condemn.45. All the naval belligerents exercised the right of opening mails. The United States conceded the right of opening mails for the purpose of deciding whether their contents were liable to condemnation.46. In 1916 His Majesty5s Government decided that there were grounds on which condemnation could be sought of seditious literature as such. The matter never came before the Prize Court, and the legal validity of this contention is a
matter of speculation. If the contention could not be maintained, His Majesty&apos;s Government would not in the absence of a blockade be justified in interfering at all with outward bound mails.47. The justification in the Prize Court of the seizure of goods ostensibly destined for neutral countries depended to a very large extent indeed on evidence supplied by the censorship, and it is not easy to see how any considerable measure of interference with traffic through neutral countries could be maintained if the sources of supply used during the late war by reason of the practically complete supervision over cables, wireless messages and postal correspondence were not available. This subject is discussed at length in the Report of the Legal Sub-Committee (Paper No. L.C. 26).(k.) The Right to Arm Defensively British Merchant Ships.. 48. This is based on a long established practice, and the questions to which it gives rise relate, in the first instance, rather to the relations between the belligerents than to those between the belligerent which armed the merchant ships and neutrals. The neutrals&apos; interest arises over the admission of such vessels to neutral ports on the footing of merchantmen. During the war nearly all neutral countries (Holland, however, excepted) so admitted them, but the question is one which may give rise to difficulties at. any time, and the action of neutrals is likely to depend on the circumstances as they then exist.(1.) The Right to Retaliate against a Belligerent who breaks International Law, Treaty Obligations or the Customary Usages of Naval Warfare.49. It is impossible to deal with this question summarily. The right to retaliate for breaches of the laws of war is generally admitted; the main question which arises is whether measure of retaliation must be confined to action which hurts the enemy alone, or whether such measures are legitimate, even though they may affect the interests of neutrals. The British Prize Courts have upheld the view that retaliatory action may be justified notwithstanding that it affects the rights of neutrals, but it is certainly not safe to assume that this view is a generally accepted doctrine of international law, or would be so regarded by the United States.Storey&apos;s Gate, S.W. 1, March 1928.

BELLIGERENT RIGHTS AT SEA.Report of the Technical Sub-Committee.INTRODUCTION.1. THE Committee was appointed by the Belligerents Rights Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence at its meeting on the 20th December, 1928. Its task was to re-examine, in the light of the proposal that a distinction should be drawn between public and private wars, the ground covered in the papers numbered B.R. 20, 38 and 39, and see whether it was not possible to arrive.at a policy in connection with belligerent rights which would safeguard the essentials of the Admiralty, and .at the same time afford some reasonable prospect of an agreement with the United States.2. For this purpose the Committee has re-examined with great thoroughness the whole of the ground covered in the above papers, and now submits a report which it ventures to think will provide the Belligerent Rights Sub-Committee with material sufficient to enable them to decide on the policy to be adopted in connection with any American proposal for the meeting of a conference on the subject of belligerent rights.3. Before indicating our detailed conclusions on the subjects dealt with in papers B.R. 20, 38 and 39, it is necessary to explain that a summary of a private letter addressed by the British Ambassador in Washington to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs was communicated to us. This letter showed that there was but little hope of persuading the United States Government to enter into an agreement based on the making of a distinction between public and private wars, and as to the particular measure of belligerent rights appropriate to what is called a &apos;&apos; public war,&quot; i.e:, a war in which H.M. Government, as a Member of the League, would, in pursuance of Article 16 of the Covenant, be endeavouring to prevent all intercourse, commercial or otherwise, between a Covenant-breaking state and any other state, whether a Member of the League or not, and where, for this purpose, Great Britain treated the act of the Covenant-breaking state in resorting to Avar as a hostile act to Avhich it replied by a declaration of war, and thereby assumed the power to exercise belligerent rights at sea,4. If this assumption is correct, it follows that it is probable that any conference on belligerent rights convened by the United States of America Avill deal only with the rights which can be exercised in a so-called &apos;&apos; private &apos;&apos; war, and not with any more extensive rights which it might be possible to arrange to exercise in a future Avar. Accordingly, the Committee has limited its enquiry to the questions Avhich might arise if Great Britain found itself at war with another state in circumstances Avhich entail no breach of the Covenant on either side and, therefore, entitled other states Members of the League to claim to adopt an attitude of neutrality.5. It is in reality quite unlikely that the case will ever arise, for the folloAving reason : If the Kellogg Pact goes through, it is almost certain that either Great Britain herself or her opponent Avill have violated the obligations of that instrument, and if that happens the force of public opinion in other states may be so strong against the state which has disturbed the public peace, in violation of the Kellogg Pact, as to render other states indisposed to give it the benefits of an attitude of neutrality. It is, however, possible that the case Avill arise, and our report has been framed on the assumption that it Avill do so.6. It is also well to point out that in a so-called public Avar Avhere all states Members of the League will be called upon to take measures in pursuance of their obligations under Article 16 of the Covenant, it is by no means certain that the United States will claim to act as a neutral. The state Avhich has Adolated the Covenant will also have violated the Kellogg Pact, and it should not exceed the capacity of British diplomacy at the time, coupled with the force of public opinion, to secure that the United States Avill not allow American nationals to support by unrestricted trade the state which has gone to Avar in breach of the Kellogg Pact. It is not impossible that in such a case a voluntary curtailment of American exports and a restriction of economic assistance to the state which has broken the Kellogg Pact would be rendered less, and not more probable by the existence of an agreement [18693] b 2
with the United States under which H.M. Government would be entitled to control such exports by belligerent action at sea. If this view is sound, no harm will have resulted from the absence of any attempt at the present stage to negotiate an agreement with the United States as to what shall be permissible in the way of belligerent rights at sea in the case of a public war.7. In pursuing our investigations as to the feasibility of an agreement with the United States on the subject of belligerent rights, we have used as the basis of our work the Declaration of London of 1909. We have done so because of a state-ment in the private letter referred to above, which said that the idea of Mr. Borah was to take the Declaration of London as the starting-point. We have considered each of the matters dealt with in the Declaration of London and have considered its provisions in the light of the United States Naval Instructions of 1917 and of the Memorandum which the United States Government, like all other Governments that participated in the Naval Conference of 1908-9, submitted to that Conference as embodying its views on the correct rules of international law relating to the various matters to be discussed at the Conference.8. The United States Naval Instructions of 1917 are in this connection of particular importance. These instructions comprise rules covering practically all the matters dealt with in this Report. In the extent to which they recognise the right of the naval forces to exercise belligerent rights, they show an appreciable advance upon the standpoint adopted by the United States Government in the diplo-matic notes exchanged during the war, and on many points they formulate rules on which it would be possible for the British Navy to act effectively in time of war. They thus provide a useful guide as to the view which the United States Government may be expected to maintain in any conference. Even if they were withdrawn by the United States Government, they would remain on record as the instructions which were in force for ten years during and after the war. No Government could maintain that the instructions it had issued to its own fleet and maintained in force for so long a time as ten years were contrary to international law.9. The contents of the Declaration of London do not cover all the matters which any complete Code of Maritime Law would have to cover if friction and disputes between Great Britain and the United States in time of war were to be avoided, and H.M. Government must therefore be prepared for the United States to raise at any such conference matters not dealt with by the Declaration of London, even if the Declaration of London were taken as the basis of the discussion. There is more difficulty with regard to some of the matters not covered by the Declaration of London than with regard to those which are so covered. What is wanted at present is an agreement which covers so much of the ground as the United States Government thinks ought to be covered. Consequently, ELM. Government would not suffer if any agreement which emerged from a belligerent rights conference did not cover these disputed points.10. For the purposes of this report we have been obliged to take as the hypothetical case a war between Great Britain alone and some other powerful European state alone, there being no allies on either side. It is perhaps not fully realised that the circumstances of any such &quot;war would be totally different from those of the war of 1914-18, and that many things that were done in the late war for the purpose of controlling neutral commerce and applying economic pressure to the enemy could not be done in any such single-state war as is indicated above. It has already been pointed out in A.T.B. 59 (Report of the Legal Committee of the Advisory Committee on Trading and Blockade) that at the outset of any such war British belligerent action would in all probability have to be limited, in the absence of a formal blockade, to seizing and sending in for adjudication by the Prize^ Court ships carrying consignments of contraband goods as to which the Procurator-General could produce affirmative evidence to establish a destination to the enemy country. Action of this kind would be small in comparison with the magnitude of the control over sea-borne commerce which Great Britain succeeded in organising during the late war. We think it unlikely that Great Britain could ever in such a single-state war as we have indicated above organise in any circumstances action comparable to that taken in the late war.11.   Speaking broadly, the circumstances would be different in five respects.Firstly, in the war of 1914 the number of states engaged as belligerents was so great that the neutral states on the continent of Europe were few in number and
weak in strength. Owing to their being few in number, the proportion of the commerce of Europe which it was necessary to control in order to prevent supplies reaching the enemy states was definitely limited. Owing to their being weak in strength they were not in a position to make effective resistance to the drastic treat-ment to which their commerce was exposed at the hands of the Allied Powers in order (1) to prevent supplies from reaching the&apos; enemy states across their land frontiers, (2) to prevent them exporting their own produce to the enemy states and replacing it ,by supplies from overseas.Secondly, the Allies had almost complete control over cables and a very large measure of control over postal mails, and the bulk of the information which was relied on in the Prize Court was derived from these sources.Thirdly, Great Britain&apos;s peculiar position as (a) the centre of the money market of the world, (b) the centre of the insurance world, (c) the only state in a position to supply bunker coals to ships, and (d) a State possessing certain minor advantages in respect of a practical monopoly of jute, &amp;c, enabled Great Britain to oblige most of the vessels carrying sea-borne commerce to come into British ports and submit to a control of the cargo which they were carrying; this never could have been achieved by the mere exercise of belligerent rights at sea alone.Fourthly, the degree of sympathy in the United States with the Allied cause was sufficient to predispose the American people to tolerate a measure of inter-ference with their commerce by the Allied Powers in general and Great Britain in particular, which they are unlikely to tolerate in the case of such a single-state war as is supposed above, a measure of interference and control which at any moment during the late war the United States could, if they wished, have rendered impossible by the simple expedient of cutting off the supplies of those commodities which the Allied Powers regarded as essential for the purpose of continuing the war.Fifthly, a great part of the economic pressure was exerted in the late war through measures which were based on the principle of retaliation for Germany&apos;s violation of the laws of war. These began with the Order in Council of the 15th March, 1915, under which power was taken to intercept any goods going to Germany, whether contraband or not, and any goods coming from Germany, even though no blockade in the formal sense had been declared.12. In the case of such a single-state war as we have suggested, it is plain that all the above conditions would not be reproduced. If Great Britain were opposed to a single European nation, the state of affairs described under the heading Firstly above would not exist at all. In order to prevent supplies reaching the country in question through neutral countries, it would be necessary to control the sea-borne imports of the entire continent of Europe, and the task not only of intercepting and examining ships whose cargo might reach the enemy, but of collecting and producing the evidence necessary to establish a case in the Prize Court, would be enormously greater and more difficult than in the late war. Further, it is to our mind&quot; inconceivable that the continental states whose overseas commerce it would be necessary to control would tolerate the interception and control of every cargo of sea-borne commerce on its way to a neutral port affording access to an enemy state in order to make sure that nothing in those cargoes and nothing equivalent to any of those cargoes made its way thereto from those countries. Nor does it seem likely that it would be possible to secure the establishment in the countries concerned of those methods of control which were exercised in the late war through such organisations as the Netherlands Overseas Trust, or that it would be possible to prevent the neutral Governments concerned from taking over the control and distribution of particular commodities and refusing to admit our right to intercept supplies of such commodities when consigned to themselves. The state of affairs described under Secondly and Thirdfy above would probably exist, if at all, to a much less degree than in the late war; the point raised under Fourthly would depend upon the circumstances of the case, and that under Fifthly on the action of the enemy state.13. We have started, therefore, from the assumption that the extent to which belligerent rights could be exercised by Great Britain in a single-state war in the future would be very different from that to which they were exercised in the late war. We have assumed that Great Britain could not count on exercising belligerent rights higher than those which are generally recognised by writers on international law and in the. Prize Court decisions of maritime states.
VISIT, SEARCH AND DETENTIONPaver No. B.R. 20, Para. 8.8.   To sum up (1) During.the war the right of visit and search was exercised in a novel form.(2) There was before 1914 no established practice of diverting neutral vessels from their course and holding them in port pending a decision.   It was, however, adopted bythe principal Naval belligerents on both sides. (3) It is impossible to control supplies to the enemy through adjacent neutral countrieswithout extending the right of visit and search so as to include the right of detainingpending enquiry.(4) The United States, as neutrals, denied the validity of this extension, and their Naval Instructions of June 1917 indicate that they adhere to this attitude.United States Naval Instructions.47. The boarding officer shall first examine the ship&apos;s papers in order to ascertain her nationality, ports of departure and destination, character of cargo, and other facts deemed essential. If the papers furnish conclusive evidence of the innocent character of vessel, cargo, and voyage, the vessel shall be released; if they furnish probable cause for capture she shall be seized and sent in for adjudication.48. If the papers do not furnish conclusive evidence of the innocent character of the vessel, the cargo, and voyage, or probable cause for capture, the boarding officer shall continue the examination by questioning the personnel or by searching the vessel or by examining her cargo. If such further examination furnishes satisfactory evidence of innocency, the vessel shall be released&apos; otherwise she shall be seized and sent in for adjudication.
14. These considerations have obliged us to remember that, if our relations with the United States at the present stage render it politically desirable to come tc an agreement with the United States on the subject of belligerent rights, it is undesirable to sacrifice the political advantage to be derived from the conclusion of such an agreement merely because the United States will not recognise as valid methods of exercising those rights which could not be effectively employed in practice.15. In the remainder of this report we have for convenience followed the order in which the subjects are dealt with in B.E. 20, as the Declaration of London does not cover the whole ground.VISIT, SEARCH AND DETENTION.16. As pointed out in B.R. 20, paragraph 8, the right of visit and search was exercised during the late war in a novel form. This novel form consisted in diverting vessels from their course into port and in the investigation by H.M. Government of all the available information as to the vessel and her cargo at their leisure before deciding whether or not to exercise their right of capture. The process came to be known as &quot;detention&quot; and the use of the phrase led to the idea that H.M. Government were setting up a new belligerent right. The United States protested against this procedure during the war, on the ostensible ground that the decision to capture should be based only on such evidence as was to be found on the ship herself in accordance with the old practice and not on any extraneous evidence. The United States Naval Instructions of 1917, paragraphs 47 and 48, are not so worded as wholly to exclude the use of extraneous evidence in deciding on capture, but they appear to assume that the decision must be made on the spot and without bringing the vessel in for examination. In present day conditions the exclusion of all extraneous evidence coupled with insistence on a decision as to capture when the vessel is first encountered at sea would render effective belligerent action impossible, and it is unlikely that the United States would insist on maintaining the views which they urged in the diplomatic discussions during the war, as reflection would show them that, if they were themselves belligerents, they would be unable to exercise any adequate control over neutral commerce on its way to the enemy through neutral ports.17. Even if a basis of agreement cannot be established with the United States in preliminary conversations, the subject could be discussed at a conference. It is not essential from the strictly legal point of view that this matter should be made the subject of prior agreement with the United States. H.M. Government in time of war could probably obtain all they Avant if they worked on the basis of the United States Naval Instructions, paragraphs 47 and 48. If the enforced deviation and detention of neutral vessels were objected to by the American Government, H.M. Government could effect the capture on the high seas in any case where they had grounds for suspicion. This might increase the extent to which compensation could be claimed in the Prize Court, but during the late Avar the Privy Council have already indicated in one case that the naval forces must have&quot; some ground for suspicion before they oblige a neutral A^essel to deviate from her course and come into port for search.18. In this, as in other matters, the difference betAveen the tAvo Governments is probably not so much one of principle as in the application of a principle. It can never be otherwise than distasteful to a powerful maritime State to see its merchant vessels compelled by a belligerent to deviate from their course for the purpose of being taken into port and to suffer the delay and expense necessarily incidental to a thorough examination of their cargoes; and its public opinion at home would not be likely to be impressed by the obvious reasonableness of the action taken from the point of view of the belligerent. Such action would always be represented as an abuse of belligerent rights, Avhatever its strictly legal justification might be, and this would probably still be the case if capture were substituted for deviation and detention in the manner suggested above. For this reason it would be extremely desirable if the possibility of some kind of navicert system to become operative ini time of war could be explored in the course of any informal conversations which may take place with the American GoA&apos;ernment.
sBLOCKADE.United States Naval Instructions. Extent and Limitations.26. A blockade must be limited to the ports and coasts belonging to or occupied by the enemy; must not bar access to neutral ports or coasts. A blockade, to be binding, must be effective. A blockade must be applied equally to the ships of all nations.(For declaration by naval No. 1; for notification to be authorities of the blockaded No. 2.)officer, see Form made to the local region, see FormDeclaration of Londox. Article 19.Whatever may be the ulterior destination of a vessel or of her cargo, she cannot be captured for breach of blockade, if, at the moment, she is on her way to a non-blockaded port.Effectiveness.27. The blockade, to be effective and binding, must be maintained by a force sufficient to render ingress to or egress from the port dangerous. If the blockading vessels be driven away by stress of weather and return thereafter without delay to their station, the continuity of the blockade is not thereby broken. The blockade ceases to be effective if the blockading vessels are driven away by the enemy or if they voluntarily leave their stations, except for a reason connected with the blockade; as, for instance, the chase of a blockade runner.As the suspension of a blockade is a serious matter, involving a new notification, commanding officers will exercise especial care to preserve the continuity and effectiveness of the blockade.Notification to Neutrals.28. Neutral vessels are entitled to notification of a blockade before they can be made prize for its attempted violation. The character of this notification is not material. It may be actual, as by a vessel of the blockading force, or constructive, as by a proclamation or notice of the government maintaining the blockade, or by common notoriety.   (See Form No. 3.)Liability of Vessels.29. Blockade running is a distinct offence which subjects the vessel attempting to commit it,, or sailing with intent to commit it, to capture without regard to the nature of her cargo.30. If a neutral vessel attempting to enter a blockaded port has had notice of the blockade in any way, she shall be captured and sent in for adjudication; but should formal notice not have been given, the rule of constructive knowledge arising from notoriety should be construed in a manner liberal to the neutral. Vessels appearing before a blockaded port, having sailed without notification, are entitled to actual notice by a blockading vessel. (See Form No. 3.) The boarding officer shall enter in the log and the document fixing the vessel&apos;s nationality the fact of such notice, the extent of the blockade, the date, the geographical position, and the name of the blockading vessel, verified by his official signature; and shall furnish the master with a copy of the blockade proclamation. The vessel is then to be set free. Should she again attempt to enter the same or any other blockaded port as to which she has had notice, she is good prize.31. The liability of a blockade runner to capture and condemnation begins and terminates with her voyage. If there is good evidence that she sailed with intent to evade the blockade, she is liable to capture from the moment she appears upon the high seas. If a vessel has succeeded in escaping from a blockaded port, she is liable to capture at any time before she completes her voyage. But with the termination of the voyage the offence ends.Special Privileges.32. Vessels of war of neutral powers have not the positive right of entry to a blockaded port. They should, however, as a matter of courtesy, when practicable, be allowed free passage to and from a blockaded port. Permission to visit the blockaded port is subject to any conditions as to length of stay or otherwise that the senior officer of the blockade may deem necessary and expedient-33. In circumstances of urgent distress beyond the possibility of relief by the blockading force, a neutral vessel may be permitted to enter a place under blockade, and subsequently to leave it under conditions prescribed by the commanding officer of the blockading force.Special Rules.34. Blockading officers shall observe the terms of special rules adopted by the United States Government regarding days of grace and conditions of lading permitted to neutral vessels that find themselves within the limits of blockade at the time the blockade is established.
19. The observations of the Committee on this point relate to blockade of the historical type described in Chapter 1 of the Declaration of London. The suggestion has been made that many of the retaliatory measures adopted by H.M. Government during the late war might be justified and embodied in international law as a legitimate extension of the right of blockade. This means the extension of the doctrine of continuous voyage in the fullest sense to blockade both as regards imports and exports. The Committee have not thought it necessary to deal with this suggestion because they are satisfied that there would be no prospect of obtaining anything like universal assent to it at a conference at the present time. It is, however, material to bear in mind that if satisfactory rules are laid down as to the articles which can be treated as contraband and the measures to be taken for intercepting them, the right of blockade is only important in regard to the power which it alone gives to intercept enemy exports.20. No blockade of the historical type was declared in Western Europe during the late war and it was through the operations in this theatre of war that the major economic pressure was exerted on the enemy.21. Blockade as an operation of war cannot be abandoned, because it is a potent means of putting pressure on the enemy in minor wars, as, for instance, if operations had to be undertaken in Arabia, and also because in a great war the operation might be used with success in the minor theatres.22. In the areas where the greater operations are being carried on, the blockade of the coast of a powerful opponent in Europe would be rendered difficult by the necessity of maintaining some of the blockading vessels at a place which would not bar access to any neutral ports. This renders necessary the localisation of these blockading forces somewhere off the blockaded port or coastline, and thereby increases the risk of attack by aircraft and submarines.23. The rules for blockade as laid down in paragraphs 26-34 of the United States Naval Instructions of 1917 are satisfactory. They are more so than those laid down in the Declaration of London, as in the latter concessions had to be made to the continental point of view which has always diverged in some respects from the Anglo-Saxon as regards blockade. If, in order to arrive at an agreement, the United States joined with the continental Powers in insisting on the Declaration of London rules, ELM. Government need not stand out except as regards Article 19. This article absolutely excludes the doctrine of continuous voyage in relation to blockade. The Americans could scarcely oppose a modification providing that a neutral vessel which intends ultimately to reach a blockaded port should be liable to capture and condemnation even if at the moment she is on her way to a neutral port, as such a modification would be in accordance with the decisions of the American Prize Courts during the Civil War, and also with the United States Naval Instruc-tions of 1917. There is also authority in the Civil War decisions for the condemnation of goods which were intended to reach a blockaded port, even though the)- were to be carried from the neutral port to Avhich the vessel was destined in another ship. It would probably be impossible, however, at the present time, to secure this extension of the doctrine of continuous voyage, and in any case it would be of little value unless it were extended to cover the case where the goods are to be discharged in a neutral port and forwarded to the enemy country by land, and for this there is no authority either in American or British Prize decisions. The situation is much the same as regards breach of blockade outwards. The Americans would probably agree that a vessel which left a blockaded port is liable to capture for breach of blockade, even after touching at a neutral port. There is English authority for condemning goods which were conveyed from a blockaded to a neutral port by sea, if found on another ship after leaving the neutral port, but such a right would be of little value if goods, conveyed from the enemy country to a neutral port by land were exempt.[18693] c
CONTRAUnited States&apos; Naval Instructions. General.23. In the absence of notice of change which the Government of the United States may make at the outbreak of or during war, the following classification and enumeration of contraband will govern commanders of ships of war.Contraband List.24. The articles and materials mentioned in the following paragraphs (a), (6), (c) and (d), actually-destined to territory belonging to or occupied by the enemy or to armed forces of the enemy, and the articles and materials mentioned in the following paragraph (e) actually destined for the use of the enemy Government or its armed forces, are, unless exempted by treaty, regarded as contraband:  (a) All kinds of arms, guns, ammunition, explosives, and machines for their manu-f acture or repair; component parts thereof ; materials or ingredients used in their manufacture; articles necessary or con-venient for their use.(b) All contrivances for or means of transporta-tion on land, in the water or air, and machines used in their manufacture or repair; component parts thereof; materials or ingredients used in their manufacture; instruments, articles or animals necessary or convenient for their use.(c) All means of communication, tools, imple-ments, instruments, equipment, maps, pictures, papers and other articles, machines, or documents necessary or convenient for carrying on hostile operations.(d) Coin, bullion, currency, evidences of debt; also metal, materials, dies, plates, machinery or other articles necessary or convenient for their manufacture.(e) All kinds of fuel, food, foodstuffs,  feed,forage, and clothing and articles and materials used in their manufacture.69. Contraband, in paragraph 24 (a), (b), (c) and (d), is liable to capture if its actual destina-tion is the territory belonging to or occupied by the enemy, or the armed forces of the enemy. It is immaterial whether the carriage of this contraband to such actual destination be direct in the original vessel or involves transhipment or transport overland.71. A destination for the use of the enemy Government or its armed forces referred to in paragraph 70 is presumed to exist if the contraband is consigned (a) To enemy authorities.(b) To a port of equipment or supply of the armed forces of the enemy or other place serving as a base for such armed forces. &apos;(c) To a contractor or agent in enemy territory who, by common knowledge, supplies articles of the kind in question to the enemy authorities.72. A destination to territory belonging to or occupied by the enemy or to the armed forces of the enemy, referred to in paragraph 69, is presumed to exist if this contraband is consigned &quot;to order,&quot; &quot;to order or assigns,&quot; or with an unnamed consignee, but in any case going to the territory belonging to or occupied by the enemy, or to neutral territory in th ^ vicinity thereof.Declaration of London . Article 27.Articles which are not susceptible of use in war may not be declared contraband of war.Article 29.Likewise the following may not be treated as contraband of war :  , (1) Articles serving exclusively to aid the sick and wounded. They can, however, in case of urgent military necessity and subject to the payment of compensation, be requisi-tioned, if their destination is that specified in Article 30. (2) Articles intended for the use of the vessel in which they are found, as well as those intended for the use of her crew and passengers during the voyage.Article 30.Absolute contraband is liable to capture if it is shown to be destined to territory belonging to of occupied by the enemy, or to the armed forces of the enemy. It is immaterial whether the carriage of the goods is direct or entails transhipment or i subsequent transport by land.Article 31.Proof of the destination specified in Article 30 is complete in the following cases :  (1) When the goods are documented for discharge in an enemy port, or for delivery to the armed forces of the enemy.(2) When the vessel is to call at enemy ports only, or when she is to touch at an enemy port or meet the armed forces of the enemy before reaching the neutral port for which the goods in question are documented.Article 32.Where a vessel is carrying absolute contraband, her papers are conclusive proof as to the voyage on which she is engaged, unless she is found clearly out of the course indicated by her papers and unable to give adequate reasons to justify such deviation.Article 33.Conditional contraband is liable to capture if it is shown to be destined for the use of the armed forces or of a government department of the enemy State, unless in this latter case the circumstances-stances show that the goods cannot in fact be used for the purposes of the war in progress. This latter exception does not apply to a consignment coming under Article 24 (4).Article 34.The destination referred to in Article 33 is presumed to exist if the goods are consigned to enemy authorities, or to a contractor established in the enemy country who, as a matter of common knowledge, supplies articles of this kind to the enemy. A similar presumption arises if the goods are consigned to a fortified place belonging to th1-&apos; enemy, or other place serving as a base for the armed forces of the enemy. No such presumption however, arises in the case of a merchant vessel bound for one of these places if it is sought to j^rove that she herself is contraband.
CONTRABAND.24. The British list of contraband during the closing stages of the late war covered a vast variety of items, and the lists of absolute and conditional contraband now maintained in readiness for issue in the event of war contain no less than 264 and 42 items respectively, and are most detailed in their composition. The United States have proceeded upon a different basis. The United States Naval Instructions of 1917 group contraband under descriptions of a generic character and, in five sections, cover the great majority of the items mentioned in the British list, and also contem-plate the possibility of a modification, or extension, of that list at the outbreak of or during the war. It would be possible for H.M. Government to achieve all that is necessary at the outset of a war on the basis of the existing American classification.25. The lists of absolute and conditional contraband and the list of goods which were never to be contraband embodied in the Declaration of London were found to be unsuitable and were never adopted.26. As regards destination, the Declaration of London excluded the operation of the principle of continuous voyage in the case of conditional contraband. This also did not stand the test of war and was abandoned by Great Britain from the outset. It finds no confirmation in the United States Naval Instructions, nor in the American attitude at the Naval Conference, 1908-9.27. In regard to contraband, we refer to what we have said above in para-graph 12; disputes with the United States with regard to this question would arise not from the principles laid down in the rules, but from their application. Even admitting that contraband on its way to a neutral port is liable to seizure and con-condemnation if it can be shown to possess an enemy destination, Great Britain would not, in fact, be able in time of war to interfere with the whole of the sea-borne imports of neutral nations for the purpose of satisfying herself that no part of those imports would ultimately reach or benefit the enemy.28. Of the Articles of the Declaration of London in which contraband is dealt with, Articles 22-26 and 28 (lists of contraband, &amp;c.) are unacceptable for the reasons given above.Article 27 proclaims a principle which is harmless, though ceasing in modern times to have any practical application. Article 29 is unobjectionable.Article 30 requires modification so as to exclude, so far as possible, the principle (which was our own accepted doctrine up to the late war) that in continuous voyage cases there must be a preconceived intention on the part of the shippers to forward the goods to the enemy through a neutral port. During the war our courts treated the question as being in each case a question of fact, namely, would these goods, if they had not been seized, have reached the enemy 1 The United States Naval Instructions (paras. 24 and 69) seem to recognize this view by the use of the phrases &quot; actually destined &quot; and &quot; actual destination.&quot; Great Britain could accept either these paragraphs (24 and 69) or a modification of Article 30 of the Declaration of London in the following terms : &quot; Absolute contraband is liable to capture if it is in fact destined to reachterritory,&quot; &amp;c, &amp;c, as in the original Article.Article 31 creates presumptions as to the destination of absolute contraband. We see no great advantage in preserving them. It may be regarded as reasonably certain that in circumstances Such as those specified a Prize Court would reach as inferences of fact the same conclusions as those which this article provides are to be presumed as matters of law.Paragraph 72 of the United States Naval Instructions recognizes presumptions, but is too badly drafted to be acceptable.Article 32 is unobjectionable.Article 33 should, for the reasons indicated above in connection with Article 30, lie re-drafted.If it is desired to provide for presumptions, in the case of conditional contraband, Article 34 should be replaced by something on the lines of paragraphs 71 and 72 of the United States Naval Instructions.Article 35 is unacceptable. It excludes the application of the doctrine of continuous voyage to conditional contraband, and is contrary to United States prize[18693] c 2
Declaration of London.-(Continued.)In cases where the above presumptions do not arise, the destination is presumed to be innocent.The presumptions set up by this Article may be rebutted.Article 35.Conditional contraband is not liable to capture, except when found on board a vessel bound for territory belonging to or occupied by the enemy, or for the armed forces of the enemy, and when it is not to be discharged in an intervening neutral port.The ship&apos;s papers are conclusive proof both as to the voyage on which the vessel is engaged and as to the port of discharge of the goods, unless she is found clearly out of the course indicated by her papers, and unable to give adequate reasons to justify such deviation.Article 36.Notwithstanding the provisions of Article 35. conditional contraband, if shown to have the destination referred to in Article 33, is liable to capture in cases where the enemy country has no seaboard.Article 37.A vessel carrying goods liable to capture as absolute or conditional contraband may be captured on the high seas or in the territorial waters of the belligerents throughout the whole of her voyage, even if she is to touch at a port of call before reaching the hostile destination.Article 38.A vessel may not be captured on the ground fhat she has carried contraband on a previous occasion if such carriage is in point of fact at an end.Article 39.Contraband goods are liable to condemnation. Article 40.A vessel carrying contraband may be con-demned if the contraband, reckoned either by value, weight, volume, or freight, forms more than half the cargo.Article 41.If a vessel carrying contraband is released, she may be condemned to pay the costs and expenses incurred by the captor in respect of the pro-ceedings in the national prize court and the custody of the ship and cargo during the proceedings.Article 42.Goods which belong to the owner of the contraband and are on board the same vessel are liable to condemnation.Article 43.If a vessel is encountered at sea while unaware of the outbreak of hostilities or of the declaration of contraband which applies to her cargo, the contraband cannot be condemned except on payment of compensation; the vessel herself and the remainder of the cargo are not liable to condemnation or to the costs and expenses referred to in Article 41. The same rule applies if the master, after becoming aware of the outbreak of hostilities, or of the declaration of contraband, has had no opportunity of discharging the contraband.A vessel is deemed to be aware of the existence of a state of war, or of a declaration of contraband, if she left a neutral port subsequently to the notification to the Power to which such port belongs of the outbreak of hostilities or of the declaration of contraband respectively, provided that such notification was made in sufficient time. A vessel is also deemed to be aware of the existence of a state of war if she left an enemy port after the outbreak of hostilities.
ladecisions and Naval Instructions. Article 36 depends on Article 35. Articles 37 38 and 39 are unobjectionable. &apos;The rule laicl down in Article 40 is on the whole more favourable to a belligerent than that adopted in our own Courts, which requires proof of knowledge on the part of the shipowners.  We think, therefore, it may be accepted.Articles 41, 42 and 43 are acceptable, but might require modification in details Article 44 (voluntary handing over of contraband by the vessel to escape capture) can be accepted. r     r     /
UNNEUTRAL SERVICE.&quot;United States Naval Instructions.36. A   neutral  vessel   is   guilty   of   indirect -unneutral   service   and   may  be   sent   in   for adjudication   as   a   neutral   vessel   liable   to condemnation Declaration of London. Article 47.Any individual embodied in the armed forces of the enemy who is found on board a neutral merchant vessel, may be made a prisoner of war, even though there be no ground for the capture of the vessel.(a) If she specially undertakes to transport individual passengers who are embodied in the armed forces of the enemy and who are en route for military service of the enemy or to a hostile destination, or transmits intelligence in the interests of the j enemy whether by radio or otherwise. I(b) If, to the knowledge of the owner, or the charterer, or of the agents thereof, or of the master,she is transporting a military detachment of the enemy, or one or more persons who are embodied in the military or naval service of the enemy and who are en route for military service of the enemy or to a hostile destination, or one or more persons who, during the voyage, lend direct assistance to the enemy, or is transmitting information in the interest of the enemy by radio or otherwise.Direct Unnei&amp;ral Service.39. A neutral vessel is guilty of direct unneutral service and may not only be captured but may be treated as an enemy merchant vessel (ai) If she takes a direct part in the hostilities;(h) If she is under the orders or under the control of an agent placed on board by the enemy Government;(c) If she is chartered by or in the exclusive employment of the enemy Government;(d) If she is at the time exclusively engaged in, or wholly devoted to, either the transport of enemy troops or in the transmission of information in the interest of the enemy by radio or otherwise.DESTRUCTION OF*   United States Naval Instructions.1 94. An enemy ship made prize may be destroyed by the capturing officer in case of military necessity, when the vessel can not be sent or brought in for adjudication.95. Engaging in unneutral service as defined in paragraph 39 stamps a neutral vessel with hostile character, and such a neutral vessel made prize may be destroyed by the capturing officer in the case of military necessity, when the vessel can not be sent or brought in for adjudication.96. Owing to the serious responsibility involved, a neutral vessel not engaged in unneutral service as defined in paragraph 39, must not be destroyed by the capturing officer save in case of the gravest military emergency which would not justify him in releasing the vessel or sending it in for adjudication. If circumstances permit, it is preferable to appraise and sell the prize, as provided in section 4615, Revised Statutes (see page 28) rather than to destroy it.97. In no case after a vessel has been brought to may it be destroyed until after visit and search has been made and all persons on board have been placed in safety, and also, if practicable, their personal effects.All the documents, letters, and papers found on board the prize shall be taken on board the capturing vessel of war and be inventoried and sealed in accordance with the procedure of section 4615, Revised Statutes (see page 28) for delivery to the prize court, with especial view to the protection of the interests of the owners of neutral PRIZES.Declaration of London. Article 48.A neutral vessel which has been captured may not be destroyed by the captor; she must be taken into such port as is proper for the determination there of all questions concerning the validity of the capture.Article 49.As an exception, a neutral vessel which has been captured by a belligerent warship, and which would be liable to condemnation, may be destroyed if the observance of Article 48 would involve danger to the safety of the warship or to the success of the operations in which she is engaged at the time.Article 50.Before the vessel is destroyed all persons on board must be placed in safety, and all the ship&apos;s papers and other documents which the parties interested consider relevant for the purpose of deciding on the validity of the capture must be taken on board the warship.Article 51.A captor who has destroyed a neutral vessel must, prior to any decision respecting the validity of the prize, establish that he only acted in the face of an exceptional necessity of the nature contemplated in Article 49. If he fails to do this, he must compensate the parties interested and no examination shall be made of the question whether the capture was valid or not.
UN NEUTRAL SERVICE.29. The Articles in the Declaration of London are not in principle unacceptable. Some verbal revision would be desirable, the wording in paragraphs 36 and 39 of the United States Naval Instructions, which inter alia deal with the transmission of intelligence by wireless in the interest of the enemy, being preferable. Article 47 should read as follows : &quot; Any individual embodied in the armed forces of the enemy, or liable to military service under the law of the enemy country, or in the service of the enemy, who is found on board a neutral merchant vessel, may be made a prisoner of war, even though there be no ground for the capture of the vessel,&quot; if the United States could be induced to accept this form.30. The object of the additions suggested to Article 47 is to authorise the removal from a neutral ship of (1) reservists on their way to join the enemy forces; (2) enemy agents. The argument in favour of the removal of these two classes is as strong as that which was held to justify the removal of members of the enemy forces, but the American attitude is likely to be opposed to the removal of either of these classes.   Of the two (2) is the more important.DESTRUCTION OF NEUTRAL PRIZES.31. British policy would best be served by the total prohibition of the destruction of neutral prizes. If the purpose of the United States Government at any conference is to restrict belligerent rights, an agreement should be possible on this basis. If that is impossible, owing to the American Prize Regulations providing for the destruction of neutral prizes in certain cases, Articles 48-54 of the Declaration of London might be accepted, or the substance of paragraphs 94-97 of the United States Naval Instructions.
United States Naval Instructions. (Contd.)any innocent neutral cargo on board. All mails on board should be saved so far as possible and practicable. (See par. 39, Form 12, Appendices IT, III.)Declaration of London. (Continued.) Article 52.If the capture of a neutral vessel is subse-quently held to be invalid, though the act of destruction has been held to have been justifiable, the captor must pay compensation to the parties interested, in place of the restitution to which they would have been entitled.Article 53.If neutral goods not liable to condemnation have been destroyed with the vessel, the owner of such goods is entitled to compensation.TRANSFER TO a united States Naval Instructions.58. The transfer of a private vessel of a belligerent to a neutral flag during the war is valid if in accordance with the laws of the State of the vendor and of the vendee, provided that it is made in good faith and is accompanied by a pay-ment sufficient in amount to leave no doubt of good faith; that it is absolute and unconditional, with a complete divestiture of title by the vendor, with no continued interest, direct or indirect, of the vendor, and with no right of repurchase by him; and that the ship does not remain in her old employment.Article 54.The captor has the right to demand the handing over, or to proceed himself to the destruction of, any goods liable to condemnation found on board a vessel not herself liable to condemnation, provided that the circumstances are such as would, under Article 49, justify the destruction of a vessel herself liable to condemnation. The captor must enter the goods surrendered or destroyed in the logbook of the vessel stopped, and must obtain duly certified copies of all relevant papers. When the goods have been handed over or destroyed, and the formalities duly carried out, the master must be allowed to continue his voyage.The provisions of Articles 51 and 52 respecting the obligations of a captor who has destroyed a neutral vessel are applicable.NEUTRAL FLAG.Declaration of London. Article 55.The transfer of an enemy vessel to a neutral flag, effected before the outbreak of hostilities, is valid, unless it is proved that such transfer was made in order to evade the consequences to which -an enemy vessel, as such, is exposed. There is, however, a presumption, if the bill of sale is not on board a vessel which has lost her belligerent nationality less than sixty days before the out-break of hostilities, that the transfer is void. This presumption may be rebutted.Where the transfer was effected more than thirty days before the outbreak of hostilities, there is an absolute presumption that it is valid if it is unconditional, complete, and in conformity with the laws of the countries concerned, and if its effect is such that neither the control of, nor the profits arising from the employment of, the vessel remain in the same hands as before the transfer. If, however, the vessel lost her belligerent nationality less than sixty days before the outbreak of hostilities and if the bill of sale is not on board, the capture of the vessel gives no right to damages.Article 56.The transfer of an enemy vessel to a neutral flag, effected after the outbreak of hostilities, is void unless it is proved that such transfer was not made in order to evade the consequences to which an enemy vessel, as such, is exposed.There, however, is an absolute presumption that a transfer is void (1) If the transfer has been made during a voyage or in a blockaded port, i (2) If a right to repurchase or recover the vessel is reserved to the vendor. (3) If the requirements of the municipal law governing the right to fly the flag under which the vessel is sailing, have not been fulfilled.
TRANSFER TO A NEUTRAL FLAG.32. The first sentence of Article 55 of the Declaration of London is in accordance with the British principle. The remainder of the Article lays down certain presumptions which would be better omitted, thus leaving the Prize Court to decide in each case whether the transfer is to be regarded as invalid. There is, for instance, an absolute presumption in favour of the validity of a transfer effected more than 30 days before the outbreak&quot; of hostilities, if it is unconditional, &amp;c. Under Article 12 of the Covenant the Members of the League agree, in case of a dispute between them, not to go to war until three months after the award by the Arbitrators or the report by the Council, and therefore if this provision of Article 55 were left in force, a state would have two months in which it could afford complete protection to its merchant shipping by transferring them to a neutral flag.33. Article 56, which deals with transfers after the outbreak of hostilities, accords higher belligerent rights than those sanctioned in the British Prize Courts in the late war. If an agreement cannot be reached on this basis in Article 56, H.M. Government could accept paragraph 58of the United states naval Instructions, or, failing this, could rest content with British practice during the late war.[18693]
ENEMY CHARACTER.Declaration of London. Article 57.Subject to the provisions respecting transfer to another flag, the neutral or enemy character of a vessel is determined by the flag which she is entitled to fly.The case where a neutral vessel is engaged in a trade which is closed in time of peace, remain? outside the scope of, and is in no wise affected by, this rule.Article 58.The neutral or enemy character of goods found on board an enemy vessel is determined by the neutral or enemy character of the owner.   .Article 59.In the absence of proof of the neutral character of goods found on board an enemy vessel, they are presumed to be enemy goods.Article 60.Enemy goods on board an enemy vessel retain their enemy character until they reach their destination, notwithstanding any transfer effected after the outbreak of hostilities while the goods are being forwarded.If, however, prior to the capture, a former neutral owner exercises, on the bankruptcy of an existing enemy owner, a recognized legal right to recover the goods, they regain their neutral -character.EVIDENCE AND PROCEDURE IN THE PRIZE COURT.Declaration of London. Article 64.If the capture of a vessel or of goods is not upheld by the prize court, or if the prize is released without any judgment being given, the parties interested have the right to compensation, unless there were good reasons for capturing the vessel or goods.
ENEMY CHARACTER.34. Great Britain found it impossible in the late war to observe in its entirety any such rule as that laid down in Article 57 of the Declaration of London, namely, that the neutral or enemy character of a vessel was determined by the flag she was entitled to fly. We reverted to the old English rule that the enemy flag is conclusive against the vessel, but the neutral flag is not conclusive against the captor. The Americans in their Instructions have adopted the rule of the Declaration of London, and a divergence with the United States over this question is not impossible.35. The practical importance of this question is whether it would enable any appreciable number of vessels to escape capture by the British naval forces where, without there having been any change of flag during the war, the vessels belong to subsidiary companies organised in neutral states by a corporation or individual in the enemy state. Where there is a change of flag before or during the war the case falls to be dealt with under the rules laid down in paragraphs 32 and 33, Transfer to a Neutral Flag.35a. It is not easy to see what importance attaches to this question, or that it is one on which it is vital for H.M. Government to insist on the maintenance of the rule followed by Great Britain in the late war. We recommend that the Board of Trade should be asked to prepare a paper on this question.36. Articles 58, 59 and 60 of the Declaration of London represent no divergence of view between Great Britain and the United States.37. If possible, a new Article on the lines of paragraph 60 of the United States Naval Instructions should be inserted : &quot; Products of the soil of the enemy country and shipped therefrom after the outbreak of war are impressed with the enemy character of territory, although the owner may be domiciled or resident in a neutral country.&quot;EVIDENCE AND PROCEDURE IN THE PRIZE COURTS.38. Primarily, all rules relating to evidence and procedure in the Prize Courts must be questions which each state settles for itself. It is the substantive rules relating to capture at sea which depend on international law. Rules of procedure must be varied in the case of each state to suit the procedure which is customary in the national courts. Nevertheless, if rules of procedure are so framed as to work hardship on neutral claimants, it is not possible to exclude discussion of them.39. Article 64 of the Declaration of London lays down a rule which gives com-pensation on the release of a ship or cargo &quot; unless there were good reasons for capturing the vessel or goods.&quot; The British Prize Courts during the late war tended to treat the slightest general suspicion as supplying justification for capture. This may have been due to the peculiar circumstances of the war, but there can be little doubt that, if the Courts had been rather more ready to award compensation in cases where the suspicion on which capture had been made was shown to be unfounded in fact, much neutral bitterness would have been avoided.40. On broad principles, a rule that a belligerent is entitled to interfere with neutral commerce, but that if he does so and cannot prove his case he must pay com-pensation, would be the easiest to maintain in the face of neutral criticism. Any such principle would not exclude the operation of rules such as that where goods are consigned &quot; to order &quot; it lies on the claimant to disprove enemy destination, and no compensation would be payable even if in such cases release were to follow.41. The extent to which vessels and goods were subjected to detention or capture was undoubtedly widened during the late Avar, and it is doubtful Avhether in the long run, bearing in mind her interests in times of neutrality, Great Britain Avould lose by a corresponding Avidening of the right of a neutral to claim compensation.42. If neutral claimants Avere not treated Avith such hardship as regards compensation as obtained in the British courts during the late Avar, there Avould be less difficulty in upholding the rules there in force as to the admissibility of extraneous evidence and as to the procedure followed in the Prize Courts.[18693] d 2
CONVOY.United States Naval Instructions.51. Neutral vessels under convoy of vessels of war of their own nationality are exempt from search. The commander of the convoy gives orally or in writing, at the request of the com-mander of a belligerent ship of war, all informa-tion regarding the vessels and their cargoes which could be obtained by visit and search.52. If the commander of the United States vessel has reason to suspect that the commander of the convoy has been deceived regarding the innocent character of any of the vessels (and their cargoes or voyages) under his convoy, the former officer shall impart his suspicions to the latter. In such a case it is to be expected that the com-mander of the convoy will undertake an examina-cion to establish the facts. The commander of the convoy alone can conduct this investigation, the officers of the United States visiting vessel can take no part therein.53. The commander of the convoy may be expected to report the result of his investigation to the commander of the United States vessel. Should that result confirm the latter&apos;s suspicions, the former may further be expected to withdraw his protection from the suspected vessel; where-upon she shall be made a prize by the commander of the United States vessel.Declaration of London. Article 61.Neutral vessels under national convoy are exempt from search. The commander of a convoy gives, in writing, at the request of the comman-der of a belligerent warship, all information as to the character of the vessels and their cargoes, which could be obtained by search.Article 62.If the commander of the belligerent warship has reason to suspect that the confidence of the commander of the convoy has been abused, he communicates his suspicions to him. In such a case it is for the commander of the convoy alone to investigate the matter. He must record the result of such investigation in a report, of which a copy is handed to the officer of the warship. If, in the opinion of the commander of the convoy, the facts shown in the report justify the capture of one or more vessels, the protection of the convoy must be withdrawn from such vessels.54. Any vessel under convoy of a vessel of war of an enemy is liable to capture.
43. This question of the admissibility of extraneous evidence is one of the few points upon which Great Britain cannot give way, and if no basis of accord can be found with the United States, the question- must be considered whether it is essential that the point should be covered in any agreement which is come to on the subject of belligerent rights, either in the form of a preliminary agreement with the United States or in a convention emerging from a conference. There seems a fair chance that if the British prize rules provided for the admissibility of extraneous evidence, and the right to use such evidence were disputed by a neutral Power and submitted as the result to international arbitration, His Majesty&apos;s Government would succeed in demonstrating that under modern conditions the refusal to admit extraneous evidence in determining the validity of the seizure was tantamount to denying the belligerent right of capture. The evidence establishing the destination would never, under modern conditions, accompany the ship or cargo. On the other hand, it is impossible to say that an international tribunal, whose bias might be in favour of the neutral claimants, would not decide that modern conditions did not justify any enlargement of the old belligerent right of capture, and that the rules as laid down in Napoleonic times admitted capture only where proof of destination accompanied the shipment.44. In view of the above, we recommend that this is a point which must be discussed with the United States Government, and every effort made to secure their acceptance of the view of the admissibility of extraneous evidence. If the effort fails, His Majesty&apos;s Government must then re-examine the situation and consider whether it is safe to allow an agreement to be concluded without mention of the question.CONVOY.45. The question of the admission of the principle or right of convoy is a question of some difficulty. The principle is that a neutral vessel under the convoy of a warship of her own nationality is exempt from search. It does not relate to neutral vessels under belligerent convoy or to neutral vessels not under national convoy.46. In 1909 Great Britain accepted the principle, subject to the safeguards-contained in Articles 61 and 62 of the Declaration of London; the United States Naval Instructions of 1917 accepted it in paragraphs 51 to 54 as safeguarded by the Articles of the Declaration of London.47. If Great Britain, basing herself on the experience of the late war. rejects the principle of convoy in toto, she is likely to be left in a position of isolation.48. There is no sufficiently good reason to reject the principle of convoy on the lines of the Declaration of London in respect of vessels on their way to an enemy port. In the case of vessels on their way to a neutral port, where the captain of the cruiser was provided with information that particular vessels or cargoes under convoy were really intended to reach the enemy, the commander of the convoy could in theory only insist on maintaining the non-liability of the vessels to capture if steps had been taken at the port of export to ensure that the goods were not intended to reach the enemy.49. If Great Britain accepted a system of convoy on the lines of the Declaration of London or of the United States Naval Instructions, in practice what would happen would be that at the beginning of the war a certain number of cargoes would slip through because the shippers had assured the authorities of the exporting country that the goods were really destined for a neutral country and the commander of the convoy was in consequence authorised to assure the belligerent authorities that all was in order. As the war went on, evidence would accumulate that the recipients of these cargoes were in fact sending them on to the enemy, and as soon as such evidence was available, it would be very difficult for the authorities of the exporting country to allow such shipments to go through under convoy. It was only after hostilities had been in progress for some time that in the late war the blockade could be tightened up to such an extent as to render it possible to prevent sea-borne supplies reaching the enemy.50. As evidence gradually accumulated in the hands of H.M. Government that cargoes sent through under convoy were reaching the enemy, it should be
possible, by diplomatic representations, &amp;o, to induce the exporting country to introduce something equivalent to the navicert system in operation at the close of the late war, under which, before goods were shipped, particulars were submitted to and guarantees obtained by ELM. Government.51. Our conclusion with regard to convoy is, therefore, that the question is one which can be discussed with the United States; that as regards convoys having an enemy destination, Great Britain could accept the Declaration of London, and that as regards convoys with a neutral destination, ELM. Government should press at the outset for the introduction of a navicert system. If this could not be obtained by agreement before the war, it would probably be safe to accept the system of convoy and as soon as evidence accumulated that shipments under convoy were getting through to the enemy to press the exporting country not to allow its confidence to be abused and to introduce a navicert system at that stage.EXAMINATION OF MAILS.52. It is unlikely that the United States intend as belligerents themselves to observe, or as neutrals to expect, the strict observance by others of the Convention signed at The Hague in 1907 which renders postal correspondence inviolable. Their contraband list includes &quot; evidences of debt&quot; among the contraband articles. This phrase covers cheques, notes, bills of exchange and similar documents which, in practice, are only carried in postal packets. During the war the United States conceded the right of opening mails for the purpose of deciding whether their contents were liable to condemnation.53. The right to open mails is one which is essential to Great Britain in time of war, but we do not regard the point as one on which it should be impossible to come to an agreement with the United States.54. As pointed out in the earlier part of our report, the circumstances in the late war enabled a much greater measure of control to be exercised over sea-borne mails than would always be possible in future. In the case of a war in which Great Britain was engaged against a single state on the continent of Europe, Great Britain could not hope, even if it were physically possible for her to do so, to subject to censorship all-the mails on their way to neutral countries which might possibly contain letters intended to reach the enemy country. Such action would entail so great a dislocation of the postal communications of neutral countries that Great Britain would be unable to resist their combined opposition. The examination of the mails would necessarily be restricted to action which would not provoke neutral intervention in the war.55. Within such limits as are possible, the examination of mails is essential to Great Britain, because it is through such an examination that the evidence for Prize Court proceedings is obtained, but the extent to which the United States admitted the right of opening mails during the late war gives all the opportunities that are necessary for the purposes of inspecting their contents.RETALIATION.56. A great part of the economic pressure exerted on the enemy in the late war was due to action taken under the policy initiated in 1915 by way of retaliation for the excesses practised by the enemy. No belligerent state can afford to bind itself by a rule as to the measure of the belligerent rights it can exercise, without an assurance that its opponent will also be bound by the same rule, but it would not be possible in an agreement to formulate any rules on the principle of retaliation. All that is possible is to introduce a provision which will render the agreement inapplicable in case the rules of war are not observed by the other side. This is the only way in which retaliation can be provided for if an agreement on belligerent rights is concluded.
GENERAL CONCLUSIONS.57. In the light of the above examination of the questions which are likely to arise in any preliminary conversations upon maritime rights between Great Britain and the United States, we&apos; have come to the conclusion that no reason exists why such conversations should not cover the whole field with which we have dealt, and that it will not be necessary to exclude any topic merely on the ground that American views upon it may not coincide with those which H.M. Government desire to uphold, or that agreement upon it may ultimately prove impossible. A close examination of the United States Naval Instructions seems to indicate that the divergence between the two countries, at any rate upon the principles involved as distinguished from the application of those principles to particular circumstances, is in the main not so great as was at one time supposed, and agreement, or at least a reasonably satisfactory compromise, appears not impossible upon most of them. One question is, however, in our opinion vital and does not permit of compromise, viz., the question of the admissibility of extraneous evidence in Prize Court proceedings; and if agreement upon this should prove impracticable in the course of any preliminary conversations, it will be necessary for H.M. Government to review the whole situation afresh before taking part in any international conference upon maritime rights and to determine whether they could safely become parties to any Convention which did not deal in a manner satisfactory to themselves with that particular subject.(Signed)CECIL J.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE NAVY OF THE UNITED STATES GOVERNING MARITIME WARFARE.(July 1917.)SECTION I. Belligerents in Neutral Jurisdiction. General.1. Belligerents are bound to respect the sovereign rights of neutral powers and to abstain, in neutral territory or neutral waters, from all acts which would constitute, on the. part of the powers which knowingly permitted them, a nonfulfilment of their neutrality.Special Provisions.2. The neutrality of a power is. not affected by the mere passage through its-territorial waters of ships of war or prizes belonging to belligerents.3. A neutral power may allow belligerent ships of war to employ its licensed pilots.Entrance, Sojourn, and Departure of Ships of War.4. In the absence of special provisions to the contrary in the legislation, ordinances, or treaties of the neutral power, the maximum number of ships of war belonging to one belligerent which may be in one of the ports or roadsteads of that power simultaneously shall be three..5. In the absence&apos; of special provisions to the contrary in the legislation, ordinances, or treaties of the neutral power, belligerent ships of war are forbidden to remain in the ports, roadsteads, or territorial waters of the said power for more than twenty-four hours, except in the cases covered by paragraphs 6, 7 8, 9, 10, and 17.(Special provisions published by neutral powers will be made known.)6. A belligerent ship of war must not prolong its stay in a neutral port beyond the period legally allowed except on account of damage or stress of weather. It must depart as soon as the cause of the delay is at an end.  .7. The regulations as to the limitation of the length of time which belligerent ships of war may remain in neutral ports, roadsteads, or waters do not apply to ships of war devoted exclusively to religious, scientific, or philanthropic purposes.8. When ships of war of opposing belligerents are present simultaneously in the same neiitral port or roadstead, a period of not less than twenty-four hours must elapse between the departure of a ship belonging to one belligerent and the departure of a ship belonging to the adversary.9. The order of departure is determined by the order of arrival, unless the ship which arrived first is so circumstanced that an extension of the period of stay legally allowed is admissible.10. A belligerent ship of war must not leave a neutral port or roadstead until twenty-four hours after the departure of a merchant ship flying the flag of its adversary.[18693] eAppendix.
Hostile Acts, Visit and Search.12. All acts of hostility, including capture and the exericise of the right of visit and search, committed by belligerent ships of war in the territorial waters of a neutral power, constitute a violation of neutrality and are strictly forbidden.&apos; Base of Operations or Communications.13. Belligerents are forbidden to use neutral ports and waters as a base of naval operations against their adversaries, and in particular to erect radio stations or any apparatus for the purpose of communicating with the belligerent forces on land or sea.Increase of War Material and Personnel.14. Belligerent ships of war must not make use of neutral ports, roadsteads, or territorial waters for replenishing or increasing their supplies of war material or their armament, or for completing their crews.1Food and Fuel.15. Belligerent ships of war can not revictual in neutral ports or roadsteads except to complete their normal peace supply subject to the approval of the neutral authorities.16. Similarly, these vessels can take only such fuel and ship supplies as are, in the opinion of the neutral authorities., sufficient to enable the vessels to reach the nearest port of their own country. They may, on the other hand, fill up their bunkers properly so called when in neutral countries which have adopted this method of determining the amount of fuel to be supplied.(Special provisions published by neutral powers will be made known.)17. If, in accordance with the law of the neutral power, the ships are not furnished with fuel, and victuals and ship supplies and necessary repairs within twenty-four hours after their arrival, the lawful duration of their stay may be extended a reasonable period by the neutral authorities.18. Belligerent ships of war which have taken fuel, victuals, and ship&apos;s supplies in a port of a neutral power can not within the succeeding three months replenish their supply in a port of the same power.21 Whoever, within the territory or jurisdiction of the United States, increases or augments, or procures to be increased or augmented, or knowingly is concerned in increasing or augmenting, the force of any ship of war, cruiser, or other armed vessel which, at the time of her arrival within the United States, was a ship of war, or cruiser, or armed vessel, in the service of any foreign prince or state, or of any colony, district, or people or belonging to the subjects or citizens of any such prince or state, colony, district, or people, the same being at war with any foreign prince or state, or of any colony, district, or people, with whom the United States are at peace, by adding to the number of the guns of such vessel, or by changing those on board of her for guns of a larger calibre, or by adding thereto any equipment solely applicable to war, shall be fined not more than one thousand dollars *nd imprisoned not more than one year.   (Section 12, act March 4, 1909.)2 &quot; Hospitality extended in the waters of the Republic of Panama to a belligerent vessel of war or a vessel belligerent or neutral, whether armed or not, which is employed by a belligerent power as a transport or fleet auxiliary or in any other way for the direct purpose of prosecuting or aiding hostilities, whether by land or sea, shall serve to deprive such vessel of like hospitality in the Panama Canal Zone for a period of three months, and vice versa. (Agreement of October 10, 1914, between the United States and Panama, regarding mutual obligations as neutrals.)11. If, notwithstanding the notification of the neutral authorities, a belligerent ship of war does not leave a port where it is not entitled to remain, the neutral power is entitled to take such, measures as it considers necessary to render the ship incapable of taking the sea during the war, and the commanding officer of the ship must facilitate the execution of such measures.
Repairs.19. In neutral ports and roadsteads belligerent ships of war can carry out such repairs only as are absolutely necessary to render them seaworthy, and can not add in any manner whatsoever to their fighting force. The authorities of the neutral power shall decide what repairs are to be made and these must be carried out with the least possible delay.Entrance with Prize.20. A prize can be brought into a neutral port only on account of unsea-worthiness, stress of weather, or want of fuel or provisions.21. It must leave as soon as the circumstances which justified its entry are at an end.Announced Neutrality Regulations.22. United States naval officers must observe the regulations of neutrality announced by neutral nations.SECTION II. Contraband. General.23. In the absence of notice of change which the Government of the United States may make at the outbreak of or during war, the following classification and enumeration of contraband will govern commanders of ships of war.Contraband List.24. The articles and materials mentioned in the following paragraphs (a), (b), (c), and (d), actually destined to territory belonging to or occupied by the enemy or to armed forces of the enemy, and the articles and materials mentioned in the following paragraph (e) actually destined for the use of the enemy Government or its armed forces, are, unless exempted by treaty, regarded as contraband.(a) All kinds of arms, guns, ammunition, explosives, and machines for their manufacture or repair; component parts thereof; materials or ingredients used in their manufacture; articles necessary or convenient for their use.(b) All contrivances for or means of transportation on land, in the water or air, and machines used in their manufacture or repair; component parts thereof; materials or ingredients used in their manufacture; instruments, articles or animals necessary or convenient for their use.(c) All means of communication, tools, implements, instruments, equipment, maps, pictures, papers and other articles, machines, or documents necessary or convenient for carrying on hostile operations.(d) Coin, bullion, currency, evidences of debt; also metal, materials, dies, plates, machinery or other articles necessary or convenient for their manufacture.(e) All kinds of fuel, food, foodstuffs, feed, forage, and clothing and articles and materials used in their manufacture.Noncontraband.25. Articles and materials even though enumerated in paragraph 24, if exempted, by special treaty provisions, are not regarded as contraband.[18693] e 2
SECTION III.Blockade.Extent and Limitations.26. A blockade must be limited to the ports and coasts belonging to or occupied by the enemy; must not bar access to neutral ports or coasts. A blockade, to be binding, must be effective. A blockade must be applied equally to the ships of all nations.(For declaration by naval officer, see Form No. 1; for notification to be made to the local authorities of the blockaded region, see Form No. 2.)Effectiveness.27. The blockade, to be effective and binding, must be maintained by a force sufficient to render ingress to or egress from the port dangerous. If the blockading vessels be driven away by stress of Aveather and return thereafter without delay to their station, the continuity of the blockade is not thereby broken. The blockade ceases to be effective if the blockading vessels are driven away by the enemy or if they voluntarily leave their stations, except for a reason connected with the blockade; as, for instance, the chase of a blockade runner.As the suspension of a blockade is a serious matter, involving a new notification, commanding officers will exercise especial care to preserve the continuity and effectiveness of the blockade.Notification to Neutrals.28. Neutral vessels are entitled to notification of a blockade before they can be made prize for its attempted violation. The character of this notification is not material. - It may be actual, as by a vessel of the blockading force, or constructive, as by a proclamation or notice of the government maintaining the blockade, or by common notoriety.   (See Form No. 3.)Liability of Vessels.29. Blockade running is a distinct offense which subjects the vessel attempting to commit it, or sailing with intent to commit it, to capture without regard to the nature of her cargo.30. If a neutral vessel attempting to enter a blockaded port has had notice of the blockade in any way, she shall be captured and sent in for adjudication; but should formal notice not have been given, the rule of constructive knowledge arising from notoriety should be construed in a manner liberal to the neutral. Vessels appearing before a blockaded port, having sailed without notification, are entitled to actual notice by a blockading vessel. (See Form No. 3.) The boarding officer shall enter in the log and the document fixing the vessel&apos;s nationality the fact of such notice, the extent of the blockade, the date, the geographical position, and the name of the blockading vessel, verified by his official signature; and shall furnish the master with a copy of the blockade proclamation. The vessel is then to be set free. Should she again attempt to enter the same or any other blockaded port as to which she has had notice, she is good prize.31. The liability of a blockade runner to capture and condemnation begins and terminates with her voyage. If there is good evidence that she sailed with intent to evade the blockade, she is liable to capture from the moment she appears upon the high seas. If a vessel has succeeded in escaping from a blockaded port, she is liable to capture at any time before she completes her voyage. But with the termination of the voyage the offense ends.
Special Privileges.32. Vessels of war of neutral powers have not the positive right of entry to a blockaded port. They should, however, as a matter of courtesy, when practicable, be allowed free passage to and from a blockaded port. Permission to visit the blockaded port is subject to any conditions as to length of stay or otherwise that the senior officer of the blockade may deem necessary and expedient.33. In circumstances of urgent distress beyond the possibility of relief by the blockading force, a neutral vessel may be permitted to enter a place under blockade and subsequently to leave it under conditions prescribed by the commanding officer of the blockading force.Special Rules.34. Blockading officers shall observe the terms of special rules adopted by the United States Government regarding days of grace and conditions of lading permitted to neutral vessels that find themselves within the limits of blockade at the time the blockade is established.SECTION IV. UnnetjtPvAl Service. Definition.35. Unneutral service is service rendered by a neutral to a belligerent contrary to international law.  It is in its nature indirect or direct.Indirect Unneutral Service.36. A neutral vessel is guilty of indirect unneutral service and may be sent in for adjudication as a neutral vessel liable to condemnation (a) If she specially undertakes to transport individual passengers who are embodied in the armed forces of the enemy and who are en route for military service of the enemy or to a hostile destination, or transmits intelligence in the interest of the enemy whether by radio or otherwise.(b) If, to the knowledge of the owner, or the charterer, or of the agents thereof, or of the master, she is transporting a military detachment of the enemy; or one or more persons who are embodied in the military or naval service of the enemy and who are en route for military service of the enemy or to a hostile destination, or one or more persons who, during the voyage, lend direct assistance to the enemy, or is transmitting information in the interest of the enemy by radio or otherwise.37. The above provisions do not apply if, when the vessel is met at sea, she is unaware of the existence of a state of war, or if the master, after becoming aware of the opening of hostilities, has not yet been able to disembark the passengers.38. The vessel is deemed to be aware of the existence of a state of war if she left an enemy port after the opening of hostilities, or left a neutral port after the publication there of the notification to the neutral power to which the port belongs of the opening of hostilities.Direct Unneutral Service.39.   A neutral vessel is guilty of direct unneutral service and may not only be captured but may be treated as an enemy merchant vessel  (a) If she takes a direct part in the hostilities;(6) If she is under the orders or under the control of an agent placed on board by the enemy Government;(c) If she is wholly chartered by or in the exclusive employment of the enemyGovernment;(d.) If she is at the time exclusively engaged in, or wholly devoted to, either the transport of enemy troops or in the transmission of information in the interest of the enemy by radio or otherwise.
SECTION V.-. Telegraphic Communications. Submarine Cables.40. Unless under satisfactory censorship or otherwise exempt, the following rules are established with regard to the treatment of submarine telegraph cables in time of war, irrespective of their ownership.(a) Submarine telegraph. cables between points in territory belonging to or occupied by the enemy or between such territory and territory of the United States are subject to such treatment as the necessities of war may require.(b) Submarine telegraph cables between points in territory belonging to or occupied by the enemy and neutral territory may be interrupted within the territorial jurisdiction of the enemy or at any point outside of neutral jurisdiction, if the necessities of war require.(c) Submarine cables connecting an occupied territory with a neutral territory shall not be seized or destroyed except in the case of absolute necessity.They must likewise be restored and compensation shall be fixed when peace is made.(d) Submarine telegraph cables between two neutral territories shall be held inviolable and free from interruption.Radio Telegraphy.41. The commander of a naval force may regulate, or, if necessary, prohibit, the use of radio apparatus by all vessels within the immediate area of operations of the force under his command.   (See Form 4.)He may take such measures as will assure the effectiveness of the regulation or prohibition, even to the extent of requiring that the apparatus be dismantled, or in case of doubt of the observance of good faith, the apparatus may be seized. As to use of radio apparatus to aid the enemy, see paragraphs 36 and 39.SECTION VI.Visit and Search.Where and When Exercised.42. The belligerent right of visit and search, subject to exemptions mentioned in Section VII, may be exercised outside of neutral jurisdiction upon private vessels after the beginning of war in order to determine their nationality, the port of destination and departure, the character of their cargo, the nature of their employment, or other facts which bear on their relation to the war.Method of Exercise.43. The right should be exercised with tact and consideration, and in strict conformity with treaty provisions, where they exist.44. Subject to any special treaty provisions the following procedure is directed : Before summoning a vessel to lie to, a ship of war must hoist her own national flag. The summons shall be made by firing a blank charge (coup de semonce), by other international signal, or by both. The summoned vessel, if a neutral, is bound to stop and lie to, and she should also display her colors, if an enemy vessel, she is not so bound, and may legally even resist by force, but she thereby assumes all risks of resulting damage.45. If the summoned vessel resists or takes to flight she may be pursued and brought to, by forcible measures, if necessary.
46. When the summoned vessel has brought to, the ship of war shall send a boat with an officer to conduct the visit and search. If practicable, a second officer should accompany the officer charged with the examination. There may be arms in the boat, but the boafs crew shall not have any on their persons. The officer (or officers), wearing side arms, may be accompanied on board by not more than two unarmed men of the boafs crew.47. The boarding officer shall first examine the ship&apos;s papers in order to ascertain her nationality, ports of departure and destination, character of cargo, and other facts deemed essential. If the papers furnish conclusive evidence of the innocent character of vessel, cargo, and voyage, the vessel shall be released; if they furnish probable cause for capture she shall be seized and sent in for adjudication.48. If the papers do not furnish conclusive evidence of the innocent character of the vessel, the cargo, and voyage, or probable cause for capture, the boarding officer shall continue the examination by questioning the. personnel or by searching the vessel or by examining her cargo. If such further examination furnishes satisfactory evidence of innocency, the vessel shall be released; otherwise she shall be seized and sent in for adjudication.49. The boarding officer must record the facts concerning the visit and search upon the log-book of the vessel visited, including the date when and the position where the visit occurred. This entry in the log must be made whether the vessel is held or not.   (See Forms 5, 6, and 7.)Papers.50. The papers which will generally be found on board a private vessel are (see Appendix II) :1. The certificate of registry or nationality.2. A certified bill of sale,, or certificate thereof duly authenticated, in the absence of certificate of registry or nationality, or in the case of a vessel which has recently been transferred from enemy to neutral ownership.3. The crew list.4. The passenger list.5. The log book.6. The bill of health.7. The clearance papers.8. The charter party, if chartered.9. Invoices or manifests of cargo.10. Bills of lading.The evidence furnished by the papers against a vessel is conclusive. Regularity of papers and evidence of the innocence of cargo or destination furnished by them are not necessarily conclusive, and if doubt exists a search of the ship or cargo should be made to establish the facts. If a vessel has deviated far from her direct course, this, if not satisfactorily explained, is a suspicious circumstance warranting search, however favorable the character of the papers.SECTION VII. Limitations on Visit and Search. Convoy.51. Neutral vessels under convoy of vessels of war of their own nationality are exempt from searcfe. The commander of the convoy gives orally or in writing, at the request of thif. commander of a belligerent ship of war, all information regarding the vessels and their cargoes which could be obtained by visit and search.52. If the commander of the United States vessel has reason to suspect that the commander of the convoy has been deceived regarding the innocent character
of any of the vessels (and their cargoes or voyages) under his convoy, the former officer shall impart his suspicions to the latter. In such a case it is to be expected that the commander of the convoy will undertake an examination to establish the facts. The commander of the convoy alone can conduct this investigation, the officers of the United States visiting vessel can take no part therein.53. The commander of the convoy may be expected to report the result of bis investigation to the commander of the United States vessel. Should that result confirm the latter&apos;s suspicions, the former may further be expected to withdraw his protection from the suspected vessel; whereupon she shall be made a prize by the commander of the United States vessel.54.   Any vessel under convoy of a vessel of war of an enemy is liable to capture.Search of Neutral Mail Vessels. 155. The inviolability of certain postal correspondence does not exempt a neutral mail ship from the laws and customs of maritime war as to neutral merchant ships in general.SECTION VIII.Neutral or Enemy Character.Character of Vessel.56. The neutral or enemy character of a private vessel is determined by the neutral or enemy character of the State whose flag the vessel has a right to fly as evidenced by her papers..Transfer of Flag before Hostilities.57. The transfer of a vessel from one flag to another is valid when completed previous to the outbreak of war in which the State of the vendor is a belligerent, provided the transfer is made in accordance with the laws of the State of the vendor and the State of the vendee.Transfer of Flag during Hostilities.58. The transfer of a private vessel of a belligerent to a neutral flag during the war is valid if in accordance with the laws of the State of the vendor and of the vendee, provided that it is made in good faith and is accompanied by a payment sufficient in amount to leave no doubt of good faith; that it is absolute and unconditional, with a complete divestiture of title by the vendor, with no continued interest, direct or indirect, of the vendor, and with no right of repurchase by him; and that the ship does not remain in her old employment.Character of Cargo.159. The neutral or enemy character of merchandise found on board an enemy private vessel is determined by the neutral or enemy commercial domicile of the owner, whether the owner, be an individual, a firm, or a corporation. In the absence of proof of the neutral character of goods found on board an enemy vessel, they are presumed to be enemy goods.60. Articles which are products of the soil of an enemy country and shipped therefrom after the outbreak of war, are impressed with the enemy character of territory although the owner may be domiciled or resident in a neutral country.1 See also Section II &quot; Contraband,&quot; and paragraph 70.
61. Enemy goods on board an enemy vessel retain their enemy character, not-withstanding any transfer effected after the outbreak of hostilities. If however, prior to capture, a former neutral owner exercises on the bankruptcy of the enemy owner a recognized legal right to recover the goods, they retain their neutral character.SECTION IXinability to  uaptukje.Enemy Vessels.62.   Enemy vessels are liable to capture outside of neutral jurisdiction..63.   The following when innocently employed are exempt from capture :(a) Cartel ships designated for and engaged in exchange of prisoners.(b) Vessels charged with religious, scientific, or philanthropic missions.(c) Properly designated hospital ships.(d) Vessels exempt by treaty or special proclamation.(e) Small coast (not deep-sea) fishing vessels and small boats employed in local trade.The fishing vessels and small boats referred to in article 63 (e) may be subjected to special regulations imposed by the United States naval commander operating in the vicinity. They are liable to capture if such regulations be disobeyed or if they engage in any undertaking prejudicial to United States military operations by land or sea.Neutral Vessels.64.   A neutral private vessel is in general liable to capture if she (a) Attempts to avoid visit and search by flight, but this must be clearly evident; or resists with force.(b) Presents irregular or f radulent papers, or lacks necessary papers, or destroys, defaces, or conceals papers. (See for detailed provisions as to papers, paragraph 51; also Appendix II (III).(c) Carries contraband, except when permitted by treaty to surrender (&quot; deliver up,&quot; &quot; deliver out &quot;) the contraband to the captors.   (See Forms 8 to 10.)(d) Has broken or has attempted to break a blockade.   (See Sec. III.)(e) Has engaged in unneutral service.   (See Sec. IV.)(/.) Is under enemy convoy; or under neutral convoys to avoid rightful capture.65. If a neutral vessel, met at sea with contraband destined to the enemy, is unaware of the existence of a state of war or of a declaration of contraband which applies to her cargo, the vessel shall, as a rule, be sent in for adjudication, and though the cargo may not be liable to condemnation it may be detained or requisitioned. (See Form No. 7.)66. A vessel is deemed to be aware of the existence of a state of war or of a declaration of contraband if she left a neutral port after sufficient time had elapsed for the publication there of the notification of the opening of hostilities to the neutral power to which the port belongs, or for the publication there of the contraband lists proclaimed by the United States, respectively. A vessel is also deemed to be aware of the existence of a state of war if she left an enemy port after war began.Free Ships, Free Goods.67. &quot; The neutral flag covers enemy goods with the exception of contraband of war.&quot;   (Declaration of Paris, 1856, art. 2.)68. &quot; Neutral goods, with the exception of contraband of war, are not liable to capture under the enemy&apos;s flag.&quot;   (Declaration of Paris, 1856, art. 3.)[18693]  . F
Carriage of Contraband.69. Contraband, in paragraph 24 (a), (&amp;), (c), and (d), is liable to capture if its actual destination is the territory belonging to or occupied by the enemy, or the armed forces of the enemy. It is immaterial whether the carriage of the contraband to such actual destination be direct in the original vessel or involve trans-shipment or transport overland.   (See paragraph 67 above and references.)70. Contraband, in paragraph 24 (e), is liable to capture if it is actually destined for the use of the enemy government or its armed forces. It is immaterial whether the carriage of contraband be direct in the original vessel, or involves trans-shipment or transport overland.Presumption as to Destination.71. A destination for the use of the enemy government or its armed forces referred to in paragraph 70 is presumed to exist if the contraband is consigned (a) To enemy authorities.(b) To a port of equipment or supply of the armed forces of the enemy or other place serving as a base for such armed forces.(c) To a contractor or agent in enemy territory who, by common knowledge, supplies articles of the kind in question to the enemy authorities.72. A destination to territory belonging to or occupied by the enemy or to the armed forces of the enemy, referred to in paragraph 69, is presumed to exist if the contraband is consigned &quot;to order,&quot; &quot;to order or assigns,&quot; or with an unnamed consignee, but in any case going to territory belonging to or occupied by the enemy, or to neutral territory in the vicinity thereof.United States Vessels in Enemy Trade.73. Any vessel of the United States found engaged in trade of any kind with the enemy without a license so to do from the President of the United States or his duly authorized agent shall be captured and sent in for adjudication. Any vessel of the United States that is found trading under a license issued by the enemy shall be captured and sent in for adjudication.SECTION X.Colors to be Displayed on Prize.74. The act of capture shall be signified by hoisting the United States flag on board the vessel seized.75. In case the prize is an enemy vessel, the flag of the United States shall be flown at the usual place (peak or staff) over the enemy flag.76. If the prize is a neutral vessel, the neutral flag shall be flown as usual until she is adjudged to be a lawful prize by a competent court; the flag of the United States, however, shall be exhibited at the fore to indicate that she is for the time in the possession of officers of the United States.77. Whenever the colors are displayed, the procedure of the two preceding paragraphs shall be followed thereafter during the passage of the prize to the United fctates port and while under the control of the prize master in such port. (See par. 80, post.)
SECTION XI. Responsibility of Capturing Officer. Responsibility.78. An officer making a capture is held by the courts of the United States to be personally liable in damages unless the capture made by him is for probable cause.179. Probable cause is defined by the Supreme Court of the United States as follows : Probable cause exists where there are circumstances sufficient to warrant suspicion, though it may turn out that the facts are not sufficient to warrant condemnation. And whether they are or not can not be determined unless the customary proceedings of prize are instituted and enforced. (Per Chief Justice Fuller in Olinde Rodriguez, 174 U. S., 510.   1899.)* * * The term &quot;probable cause,&quot; according to its usual acceptation, means less than evidence which would justify condemnation; and in all cases of seizure has a fixed and well-known meaning. It imports a seizure made under circumstances which warrant suspicion. (Per Chief Justice Marshall in Locke v. U. S., 7 Cranch, 339.   1813.)SECTION XII.Treatment of Vessels, Goods, Postal Correspondence, Officers, Crew, andother Persons on Board.Sending Prizes in.80. Except under extraordinary circumstances, prizes shall be sent promptly to a port within the jurisdiction of the United States for adjudication. (See Section XIII.*)In general, a prize master with a crew shall be sent on board the prize for this purpose.If for any reason this is impracticable, a prize may be escorted into port by the capturing vessel or by another vessel of war of the United States or of an ally. In this exceptional case the prize shall be directed to lower her flag and to steer according to the orders of the escorting vessel of war. The prize must obey the instructions of the escorting vessel, under pain of forcible measures.81.   The procedure prescribed by the Revised Statutes shall be observed :--Sec 4515. The commanding officer of any vessel making a capture shall secure the documents of the ship and cargo, including the log book, with all other documents, letters and other papers found on board, and make an inventory of the same and seal them up and send them, with the inventory, to the court in which proceedings are to be had, with a written statement that they are all the papers found and are in the condition in which they were found; or explaining the absence of any documents or papers or any change in their condition. He shall also send to such court, as witnesses, the master, one or more of the other officers, the supercargo, purser, or agent of the prize, and any person found on board whom he may suppose to be interested in, or to have knowledge respecting, the title, national character or destination of the prize. He shall send the prize, with the documents, papers and witnesses, under charge of a competent prize master and prize crew, into port for adjudication, explaining the absence of any usual witnesses; and in the absence of instructions from superior authority as1 When, in any prosecution commenced on account of the seizure .of any vessel, goods, wares, or merchandise made by any collector or other officer under any act of Congress authorizing such seizure, judgment is rendered for the claimant, but it appears to the court that there was reasonable cause of seizure, the court shall cause a proper certificate thereof to be entered, and the claimant shall not in such case be entitled to costs, nor shall the person who made the seizure, nor the prosecutor, be liable to suit or judgment on account of such suit or prosecution: Provided, That the vessel, goods, wares, or merchandise be, after judgment, forthwith returned to such claimant or his agent. (Rev. Stat.,. sec. 970.)[18693] v 2
Sec 4617. The prize master shall make his way diligently to the selected port and there immediately deliver to a prize commissioner the documents and papers, and the inventory thereof, and make affidavit that they are the same and are in the same condition as delivered to him, or explaining any absence or change of condition therein, and that the prize property is in the same condition as delivered to him, explaining any loss or damage thereto; and he shall further report to the district attorney and give him all the information in his possession respecting the prize and her capture; and he shall deliver over the persons sent as witnesses to the custody of the marshal and shall retain the prize in his custody until it shall be taken therefrom by process of the prize court,82. If circumstances permit, it is preferable that the officer making the search should act as prize master.83. Attention is directed to articles 16 and 17 of the Articles for the Govern -ment of the Navy (sec. 1624, Rev. Stat.), which read : Art. 16. No person in the Navy shall take out of a prize or vessel seized as a prize any money, plate, goods, or any part of the equipment, unless it be for the better preservation thereof, or unless such articles are absolutely needed for the use of any of the vessels or armed forces of the United States, before the same are adjudged lawful prize by a competent court; but the whole, without fraud, concealment or embezzlement, shall be brought in, in order that judgment may be passed thereon, and every person who offends against this article shall be punished as a court-martial may direct.Art. 17. If any person in the Navy strips off the clothes of or pillages, or in any manner maltreats any person taken on board a prize, he shall suffer such punishment as a court-martial may adjudge.   (Sec. 1624, Rev. Stat., 1878.)Conversion to Public Use.84.   By the Revised Statutes captured vessels may be taken for the use of the United States.  Section 4624, Revised Statutes, reads as follows :-Whenever any captured vessel, arms, munitions or other material are taken for use of the United States before it comes into the custody of the prize court, it shall be surveyed, appraised and inventoried by persons as competent and I impartial as can be obtained, and the survey, appraisement and inventory shall I be sent to the court in which proceedings are to be had; and, if taken afterwards, sufficient notice shall first be given to enable the court to have the property appraised for the protection of the rights of the claimants and captors. In all cases of prize money taken for or approriated to the use of the Government, the department for whose use it is taken or appropriated shall deposit the value thereof with the assistant treasurer of the United States nearest to the place of the session of the court, subject to the order of the court in the cause. (Section 4624, R.S., 1878.)85. While any prize may thus be legally converted to immediate public use, and would be under compelling circumstances, it is inadvisable so to convert neutralto the port to which it shall be sent he shall select such port as he shall deem most convenient, in view of the interests of probable claimants as well as of the captors. If the captured vessel, or any part of the captured property, is not in condition to be sent in for adjudication, a survey shall be had thereon and an appraisement made by persons as competent and impartial as can be obtained, and their reports shall be sent to the court in which proceedings are to be had; and such property, unless appropriated for the use of the Government, shall be sold by the authority of the commanding officer present, and the proceeds deposited with the Assistant Treasurer of the United States most accessible to such court and subject to its order in the cause.
property taken as prize, because if the prize court fails to condemn the property indemnification for the conversion to public use may be the subject of a claim.Release on Voluntary Delivery of Contraband.86. If, under the provisions of a treaty between the United States and his country, the master of a vessel agrees to deliver and does deliver the contraband cargo to the commander of the ship of war, the vessel, as a rule, shall not be sent in for adjudication. Any contraband cargo so delivered shall be accompanied by an inventory, and a receipt therefor shall be given for the protection of interested parties. The vessel shall thereupon be released. If circumstances preclude such delivery of the contraband cargo, the vessel should in general be sent in. (See Forms Nos. 8, 9, 10.)Mail Steamers and Postal Correspondence.87. The genuine postal correspondence of neutrals or belligerents, found on board a neutral or enemy ship at sea, is inviolable. If the ship is detained, such postal correspondence is to be forwarded by the captor with the least possible delay.The provisions of the preceding paragraph do not apply, in case of violation of blockade, to correspondence destined for or proceeding from a blockaded port.88. Neutral mail ships are subject to the laws and customs of maritime war applicable to neutral merchant ships in general.Enemy Military Persons on Board Neutral Vessels.89. As to treatment of vessels outside of neutral jurisdiction and carrying persons embodied in the military service of the enemy, unless treaty provisions allow their removal from the neutral vessel and the release of the vessel herself thereupon, see paragraphs 36, 39.90. The persons referred to in paragraph 89 must be actually embodied in the military service of the enemy. Reservists or other persons subject to military duty but not formally incorporated in military service are not included.91. Persons on board captured vessels who are actually embodied in the military forces of the enemy may be made prisoners of war.92. The captain, officers, and crew of an enemy merchant ship which has resisted capture may be made prisoners of war.93. The United States may give the same treatment to nationals of enemy or neutral countries who legally come into the power of the United States by capture on the high seas that it gives to enemy or neutral nationals within its territory or jurisdiction.SECTION XIII.Destruction of Prizes.94. An enemy ship made prize may be destroyed by the capturing officer in case of military necessity, when the vessel can not be sent or brought in for adjudication.95. Engaging in unneutral service as defined in paragraph 39 stamps a neutral vessel with hostile character, and such a neutral vessel made prize may be destroyed by the capturing officer in the case of military necessity, when the vessel can not be sent or brought in for adjudication.96. Owing to the serious responsibility involved, a neutral vessel not engaged in unneutral service as defined in paragraph 39, must not be destroyed by the capturing officer save in case of the gravest military emergency which would not justify him in releasing the vessel or sending it in for adjudication.   If circum-
stances permit, it is preferable to appraise and sell the prize, as provided m section 4615, Revised Statutes (see page 28) rather than to destroy it.197. In no case after a vessel has been brought to may it be destroyed until after visit and search has been made and all persons on board have been placed in safety, and also, if practicable, their personal effects.All the documents, letters, and papers found on board the prize shall be taken on board the capturing vessel of war and be inventoried and sealed in accordance with the procedure of section 4615, Revised Statutes (see page 28) for delivery to the prize court, with especial view to the protection of the interests of the owners of any innocent neutral cargo on board. All mails on board should be saved so far as possible and practicable.   (See par. 39, Form 12, Appendices II, III.)Report of Destruction of Prize.98. Every case of destruction of prize shall be reported to the Navy Department at the earliest practicable moment.SECTION XIV.Capture of Public Vessels in the Military Service of the Enemy.99. By the fact of capture a public vessel in the military service of the enemy passes into the possession of the captor&apos;s Government, in which title immediately vests. The vessel, therefore, becomes a public vessel belonging to the captor&apos;s Government and subject to its disposal. It is unnecessary to send a captured public vessel into port for adjudication. The vessel&apos; may be immediately converted to the use of the captor and sent to any port at his convenience, as a public vessel of the United States. The captured personnel shall be made prisoners of war, except the religious, medical, or hospital staff of the ship.SECTION XV.Bombardment.Limitations on Bombardment.100. The attack or bombardment, by whatever means, of towns, villages, dwellings, or buildings which are undefended is prohibited.Naval Bombardment.101. The bombardment by naval forces of undefended ports, towns, villages, dwellings, or buildings is forbidden.102. A place can not be bombarded solely because automatic submarine contact mines are anchored off the harbor.Military Works not Exempt.103. Military works, military or naval establishments, depots of arms or war materiel, workshops or plants which could be utilized for the needs of the hostile fleet or army, and the ships of war in the harbor, are not, however, included in the foregoing prohibition.   The commander of a naval force may destroy them with1 As to the destruction, see also section 4625, Revised Statutes, which reads in part: &apos;&apos; If by reason of the condition of the captured property, or if because the whole has been appropriated to the use of the United States, no part of it has been or can be sent in for adjudication, or if the property has been entirely lost or destroyed, proceedings for adjudication  m*v commenced.   *   *   *&quot;
utillery, after a summons followed by a reasonable delay, if all other means are impossible, and when the local authorities have not themselves destroyed them within the time fixed.104. The commander incurs no responsibility for any unavoidable damage which may be caused by a bombardment under such circumstances.Precautions.105. If military necessity demanding immediate action permits no delay, nevertheless the prohibition to bombard undefended towns holds good, and the commander shall take all requisite measures in order that the town may suffer as little harm as possible.Bombardment for Requisitions.106. After explicit notice has been given, the bombardment of undefended ports, towns, villages, dwellings, or buildings may be proceeded with, if the local authorities, after a formal summons has been made to them, decline to comply with requisitions for provisions or supplies necessary for the immediate needs of the naval force before the place in question.107. These requisitions shall be in proportion to the resources of the place. They shall only be demanded in the name of the commander of the naval force, and they shall, as far as possible, be paid for in cash; if not, they shall be acknowledged by receipts.No Bombardment for Ransom.108. The bombardment of undefended towns, villages, dwellings, or buildings on account of the nonpayment of money contributions is forbidden.Preliminary Measures.109. In bombardments by naval forces all necessary measures must be token by the commander to spare as far as possible, buildings devoted to religion, to the arts and sciences, or to charitable purposes, historic monuments, hospitals, and places where the sick or wounded are collected, on condition that they are not used at the same time for military purposes.110. It is the duty of the inhabitants to indicate such monuments, edifices, or places by visible signs, which shall consist of large stiff rectangular panels divided diagonally into two colored triangular portions, the upper portion black, the lower portion white.Military Exigency.111. Unless the military exigencies will not permit the commander of the attacking naval force, before commencing the bombardment, must do his utmost to warn the authorities.Pillage Forbidden.112. It is forbidden to give over to pillage a town or place, even when taken by assault.  .
