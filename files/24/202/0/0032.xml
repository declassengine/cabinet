THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITAMHIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.SECRET COPY NO.CP. 82(29) CABINET.REPORT OP THE RADIUM SUB-COMMITTEE OP THE CIVIL RESEARCH COMMITTEE.Memorandum h\r the Minister of Health.1.     In pursuance of Cabinet Minute 11(29) of the 13th March I submit the following observations on the subject of this Report.2.     The two main points which arise for considerationare: -(1)    Provision of funds .(2)    The organization required to secure the best use of any additional stocks of radium purchased.3.     On the question of finance, on page 8, paragraph 29, of the Report will be found a statement of the view of the Sub-Commit tee as to the amount of radiiun now available (24.9 grammes), and on page 21, an estimate of the additional amount needed for England, Wales and Scotland as 24 grammes, (paragraph 94 (III)).     The Sub-Committee consider that owing to lack of personnel familiar with the technique of radium treatment and adequate accommodation in hospitals, a suitable programme to aim at would be the acquisition of about 20 additional grammes by the end of 1930, and they recommend that this amount should be acquired by instalments at an estimated total cost of not more then  200,000.The Sub-Committee considered the alternative v.ays in which this sum of money could be raised (paragraph 89), namely -
(a) by voluntary contribution only;(b) by voluntary and State contribution combined;(c) by State provision only. In view of the public interest hitherto taken in this matter on the one hand, and, on the other, of the importance of some kind of Government supervision and control, I am disposed to think that the most satisfactory arrangement would be a public appeal (by the Times newspaper or other persons interested) combined with a State subsidy on a fifty per cent, basis. I do not think it would be immediately necessary to purchase more than ten grammes, obtaining the other ten within a period of a year or more.The importance of radium in medical therapeutics is discussed on pages 4 and 5 of the Report *4.     On the question of organization, the recommendations of the Sub-Committee are fully set out on pages 16 to 20 of the Report.   They propose a body of Trustees (paragraphs 82 - 84) and a radium commission with executive functions (paragraphs 84 - 85)0    They aim at including representatives of the public and of donors as well as the necessary complement of expert knowledge and experience of public administration.I think these proposals are well designed for the purpose in view.5.     On the question of publication I may observe that as one of the objects of the appointment of a Sub-Committee was the enlightenment and guidance of the public in regard to the need for radium for medical purposes, and the directions and conditions under which such need should be met, the Sub-Committee itself anticipated that in the exceptional circumstances of the situation it would be expedient to publish the Report pretty much as it stands.
In this connection I refer to the answer which the Prime Minister gave in the House of Commons on the 25th February in reply to Mr, Morrison and Mr. Pilcher (atta ched)aI submit that it would be practicable, within the Prime Minister&apos;s answer, to say that on seeing the Report the Prime Minister has come to the conclusion that the best means of communicating its results to the House would be to publish the statement as submitted to him by the Sub-Committee0In my opinion it is not only expedient, but desirable, that the Report should be published, first, because it contains a good deal of information not otherwise obtainable;    secondly, because It indicates the needs of the situation both as regards stock of radium and the safeguards under which it should be used;    and thirdly, because it  suggests a method of organization which has the advantage of including public and expert opinion and judgment in administration.N.CeMarch, 1929,
