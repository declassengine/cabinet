Is&apos; D00UMB1TT IS THE PROPERTY OFBRITAHNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERHMEHT9 0^0 A B I HE T.COPY 11034(29)TRADE    OUTLOOK.Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.I circulate, for the information of my colleagues, reports which I have received from members of my Advisory Council, regarding the trade position and prospects.I think the report is on the whole satisfactory, and that the improvement recorded in January looks like being maintained. The importance of the February trade returns may easily be exaggerated.    It is true that overseas trade in February showed a falling off compared with January, but this may have been largely accounted for by the state of the weather in this country and all over the Continent;    and, taking into account the fact that there was one less day in February this year, our exports were up to the level of the corresponding month of a year ago.As regards particular industries, the following facts are worth noting.In coal, the increased output is well maintained, and substantial forward contracts have been made.      Indeed, as regards forward contracts,  I think the position is rather better than would appear from this report.    Several large companies have informed me that they have sold forward to the end of the year a considerable proportion of their output.    The value of railway relief is already apparent.    My colleagues will see from Mr. &apos;7arhaxi&apos;s report that in Northumberland railway freight relief converted a loss of 3d. or 4d. a ton in January into a profit of  just under Id.
fs p. oThe output of iron and steel is well maintained.        &apos; It is said that purchasers are unwilling to make contracts for more than a month or two ahead; but the large number of orders for ships which have been placed, and the apparent inability of the Continent to quote for early delivery owing to a glut of work, should ensure continuance of the high rate of output for some time to come.    The demand for non-ferrous metals continues good.Some branches of engineering have been rather badly held up by the weather-;    but prospects generally seem pretty good. In marine engineering the full effect of the shipbuilding orders will not be felt until May or June.    Orders placed by the Central Electricity Board have enabled electrical engineers to maintain their output.    An increase of 15 per cent, is recorded in consumption of electricity last year, and this increase must be reflected in the manufacturing trades.&quot;   Reports of the motor industry are fairly satisfactory.In cotton the position is better in the American Section.. Purchases have been held up in the East for some weeks, but buying has started again lately on what appears to be a fairly satisfactory scale.    The new Cotton Corporation is making steady progress.    In the Egyptian Section there is a period of organised short time.    This is regarded as a reasonable action to clear stocks and adjust prices.In the woollen and worsted industry there appears to be some slight improvement due to the lower price of wool and also some buying in this country in anticipation of a duty.Trade in chemicals remains good, especially in fine chemicals, an industry which has responded to a protective duty by active and scientific development.The hosiery traae is only moderate.The weather has had a baa effect: on the retail trade in all part3 of the country.P.C.-L.Board of Trade, 12gnd   March 1929.

3 fiflV VjNext meeting - Wednesday, April 10th.COAL.MR. WAR HAM reported that the weekly output of coal in the United Kingdom for the three weeks ended February 16th had shown a considerable increase, and was as follows:- week ended February 2nd, 5,312,000 tons: week ended February 9th, 5,429..000 tons, being 103.6 &apos; of the March 1925 weekly average basis j   week ended February 16th, 5,140,000 tons, being 98,1??-of the same weekly average.    The number of persons employed in the industry during the week ended February 16th was 81^ calculated on the March 1925 basis.   Unemployment for the monih of January had been the same as for December, namely 19,1$, as compared with 9,3 In March, 1926,   But there was some difficulty in knowing how to classify this unemployment of miners, as it was very hard to obtain coal getters for the collieries now, and it was to be feared that a large number classed as unemployed miners were men who were not really fit for work in the mines at all,    Mr. Warham had had the greatest difficulty in equipping one of the seams that he wanted to re-open, and in his own particular district 800 men were classed as unemployed miners.    In Northumberland they    ran up to about 42fo of hewers and fillers  to about 58&apos;7i of piece-workers generally.    Those he?/ers were the men who really got the coal, and when this particular Pit had been closed down some time ago, all the best men had gone away and found jobs elsewhere. The coal getter was the man who secured a transfer of work, and the men who were left consisted of unskilled underground or, surface workers.    The first time that the unemployed had been combed in that district, about 50 suitable men were found. Missionaries were then sent to the various other districts in Northumberland,  and when it was found that suitable men could not be got there, they re-combed this&quot;balance of 800, and got about 25 more men.    At one district, where the pits were closed down, the Employment Exchange, which, helped as far as it Could, gave a list of 158 names.    The men were interviewed and there was not one of them that the company could put on to Its pits.    A number of them had, perhaps, been dismissed in the .past for working short time;    others were what were called corner boys, and others were getting old and were unequal to the work,    For these reasons Mr, Warham thought that in the employment figures some classification ought .to be adopted for men of this kind other than that of &quot;unemployed miners.&quot;MR. MITCHELL added that he knew one district where 77 men were registered at the Exchange, and he had been told that only two of them could In fact be employed as coal men,MR. WARHAM, continuing,  stated, that the quantity of coal exported from the United Kingdom in January had been 4,472,631 tons, as compared with 4,184,327 tons  in December.    The average value per ton showed, a slight increase in January, being 15s07do as compared with 15s,6d, in   December.    Some of the principal increases and decreases in exports for January, as compared, with December, were as follows: - Increases:  to Scandinavia 24,000 tons;   Belgium 46,000 tons; France 171,000 tons, South America 110,000 tons.    Germany on the other hand
COAL  (contd.. ) .took 76,000 tons less and Egypt 41,000 tons less.      The rather remarkable decrease in output for the week ended February 16th was no doubt largely accounted for by the out-break, of influenza among the miners, and the consequent high percentage of men idle;    at any rate this had been the cause in Northumberland and Durham.There was, fortunately, no lessening in the demand for coal.    The closing of Danzig and Gdynia, the shipping ports for Polish coal, owing to ice in the Baltic, combined with the severe weather all over Europe, had given the coal trade of the United Kingdom a much-needed fillip, and collieries through the country were now working full time,   and in the Midlands they are working to their full capacity.Trade had been slowly improving since September, but the intense cold had turned this gradual improvement into a little boom.    This condition of things would, of course, be only temporary, but, at the same time, the industry was feeling an undercurrent of genuinely Improved demand, which might steady it for sane time to come, unless the re-opening of many collieries should counteract the effect of this, to some extent it would be some time before a financial improvement would be felt, as there had not been much free coal for sale for prompt delivery;    but collieries generally, wherever possible, were extending their outputs and booking forward business at better prices than had been possible for many months past. They had sold for very good prices up to May, but people were not ordering further than that in advance.    The de-rating of collieries was helping the financial position very much indeed. For instance in Northumberland for January there had been for the .first time for a very long time a profit of 0*88 of a penny per ton.    This would have been a loss of 3d or 4d a ton except for the de-rating.MR. MITCHELL remarked that in Scotland there was a profit of 5d a ton.MR. WARHAM replied that in Scotland they had apparently had more free coal to dispose of.MR. MITCHELL reported that the Improvement In the coal trade in Scotland was continuing.    There had been a considerable advance in prices both for home and for export. This, of course, was largely due to the cold weather in this country and on the Continent, and to the closing of the shipping ports from which Polish coal was shipped, and to the difficulty in navigating the Rhine.    It was impossible to say .how long these effects would last but there would probably be a fair demand for some time.    Scandinavian stocks must be low, s-nd there should be good shipments when navigation re-opened, Shipments from Scotland were less than they had been last year, but that was due more to shortage of coal than to shortage of demand.      The home trade in Scotland was likely to show some Improvement..
COAL (CONTD . )A fair amount, of business had been placed up to about April, but not after that,    fits, however, had not increased prices to any extent.    A good many were resuming work and this might result in an excess of supplies during the summer. The scheme which had been In operation in Scotland at the closing of the pits had formally come to an end at the end of February, although it was,  In fact, being carried on for another month.    A new scheme had been framed and issued, but it was not possible to say whether it would be better or not. It would be important to fit in the new scheme 7iith the old one.LORD GAINFORD wrote :-&quot;The demand for coke for furnaces and export has been fully maintained, and prices for prompt and forward delivery materially advanced.    The demand for manufacturing coal continues much the same, but house coal, consequent on the cold weather, has been better.    Screened, unscreened, coking and bunker coal have been in good request and prices for prompt and forward business have advanced.    The shipment of washed, coals was entirely suspended during the frost, but since the milder weather this class of coal has moved away freely.&quot;IRON AND STEEL.MR. BOND wrote:-&quot;February production and trade figures are not yet avail-able, but, although the fact that February Is a short month will affect the total volume of production for the month,  it is probable that  the rate of production was higher than at any time since the first few months following resumption of work after the coal stoppage: and it seems likely that this rate of production will continue during March, . The improvement has been due very largely to the great activity on the Continent, with consequent hardening of prices and delay in delivery, with the added factor of Increased activity in shipbuilding on the North East Coast and in Scotland.    Pig iron production is still, however, 30 per cent,  lower than in 1913 and steel production 25 por cent,  less than full capacity: moreover the improvement does not connote any substantial and permanent increase in competitive rower, and it is impossible to say how long it may last.    To this uncertainty Is very largely due the hesitation which manufacturers of pig iron have in blowing in extra furnaces, and only a few furnaces were blown in during the past month.That purchasers are also in doubt about the permanence of the improved demand and consequent ability to maintain prices is also seen from their reluctance to place forward contracts for any length of time ahead.    The situation when purchasers were buying from hand-to-mouth has improved to the extent that forward contracts are now placed for one month or two months ahead, but very few forward contracts have been
IRON AND SThEL (CONTD,)placed for later delivery than this.    The situation is &quot;being very well handled and, while the shortage of pig iron supplies would justify higher prices, the Cleveland makers have been content with the 1/- per ton advance recorded two or three weeks ago, in spite of the fact that coal, coke and ore prices are hardening.    Manufacturers are thus being very careful to do nothing to discourage the demand,&quot;Reports from the North Jiast coast indicate that the increased activity in the steel works has led to a shortage of pig iron supplies, but that for the moment local supplies are being supplemented from the Midlands and Lincolnshire. Should the demand continue, however, additional furnaces will be blown In, but so far the only local blast furnace to re-start is one at Cargo Fleet.   Additional orders which have been placed during the last week for vessels with Tees Ship-builders will enable the increased steel production to be maintained, although there is still a considerable margin between present output and capacity.&quot;In Scotland the increased activity of the steel works is benefiting pig iron makers in other districts rather than Scotland, for pig iron makers there record little,  if any, improvement.    The increased supplies of pig iron are being obtained in the main from Middlesbrough,  the Midlands, and Lincolnshire.    Prices for all these are very firm and, should the  demand from the steel works continue, a few additional Scottish furnaces may be blown in.    Steel production at the moment is greater than a month ago and it is hoped that the same healthy condition will last for at least the ensuing three months.      The major factor in the improvement is the additional orders which have been received by the Clyde ship-building yards, but export trade has also benefited from the efforts of the Export Committee.    Prices of raw materials, especially scrap and pig Iron, have shown considerable advances,  and the diiiiculty In obtaining scrap has resulted in output being hampered to some extent.    In spite of increased demand no increase has so far taken place in the price of Steel&apos;products.&quot;A settlement has been arrived at in the Scottish Wrought Iron dispute as the result of discussions in GIas.gov/ at the end of last week.    Notices are to be withdrawn and work resumed on the rates and working conditions operating prior to the stoppage, and the claim of the employers for a two-shift system with a 47-gr hours effective week, working 5 shifts per week, is to be referred to arbitration.    The Arbitrator is to be appointed by the Minister of Labour and will have the assistance of Mr. Waterson and Bailie James Walker as assessors for the employers&apos; and workers1  sides respectively.&quot;The better outlook for the North West Coast is maintained but, though stocks are falling rapidly in West Cumberland, no expansion in output is likely to take place until these are practically cleared.&quot;The improvement noted last month in the South Wales area does not appear to have been maintained and the tone is somewhat irregular.&quot;
IRON AND STEEL (CONTD, )MR. MITCHELL stated as regards the steel trade in Scotland that works were fairly well employed, a good many orders had been placed with the shipbuilding yards and prospects were very much improved.    Basic pig iron was somewhat scarce and prices had advanced both for hematite and basic pig iron.    Imports of steel in January in Scotland had been heavy, but pig iron had entirely stopped coming in from the Continent.The scrap position was somewhat serious:    there was a shortage and prices were rising.    Exports were continuing on a considerable scale, especially from the south coast of England, and it was noticed from the roturns that Poland was buying a great amount of scrap.    It had been suggested that the Polish scrap was reparation scrap, which was being sent by Germany to Poland, - that Germany was bound to supply a certain amount of reparation scrap to Poland and that she was buying it here and sending it into Poland.   The shipments into Poland were 17,417 tons in January.    Another suggestion was that Poland was buying scrap for de-tinning purposes.    Some de-tinning plants were in operation in the south of England, and perhaps the Board of Trade could ascertain whether they were capable,of dealing with adequate quantities of scrap, and also whether there was any truth In the reports just mentioned, about Germany and Poland,THE PRESIDENT observed that the Board of Trade might be able to get some information on these points.    The matter had been first brought to his notice about a year and a half ago, and he then suggested - and had repeated the suggestion quite lately - that the steel industry, if they really had occasion to be anxious about the scrap position, should try to make some arrangement with the scrap merchants here, a good time in advance, for buying a certain amount&quot;.    It was not reasonable to expect to be able to go inbo the market and buy scrap to any amount required at the moment, and pay a moderate price for spot lots, whenever they were wanted.    The president was asked to arrange with the French that they should raise their embargo on exports of scrap, and had got them to do so; but at the same time they worked out a n informal allocation of the exports to the different countries.   *&apos;&apos;e had never taken the allotted amount of scrap which France was willing to export here, although our total exports of scrap in 1928 amounted to 340,000 tons.MR. MITCHELL remarked that in January of this year these exports had reached the figure of 47,000 tons.    But of course one must keep in view that part of the exports which was not all scrap.   The difficulty was that scrap as a rule was sold in small quantities by a great number of firms.    The position was rather serious, because it had resulted in a considerably increased consumption of pig iron - which was all to the good in a way, - but steel could not be manufactured under modern processes without a considerable amount of scrap.
IRON AND STEEL (OONTD).LORD GAINFORD wrote:-&quot;The general situation of the Cleveland foundry pig iron trade continues to shew regular and marked improvement. Undelivered balances of contracts shew a further increase, while stocks in makers1 hanas again shew a large decrease. Midland basic pig iron still continues to arrive in large consignments into the River Tees.      Makers of Midland foundry pig iron have materially advanced their prices and,  in vie-/ of the increase in the price of coke, a further advance in the price of Cleveland foundry pig iron is confidently anticipated.    Hematite pig iron makes slower progress ^nd, although prices are better, makers are really no better off, in view of advances In the price of coke and ore.&quot;The immediate outlook in the British steel trade is more healthy than it has been for some time past and, although works are not operating at full capacity, they are able to see a few days&apos;  work ahead of them at the beginning of each week. Buyers .vho have work in prospect seen more inclined to come forward with their orders, as they feel that prices are more likely to advance than to fall.    It is possible also that the recent cold weather has restricted the output of works on the Continent more seriously than in Great Britain and that delivery of foreign steel to this country may have been temporarily delayed, to the advantage of British makers.&quot;In Germany, complaints are again being made that costs have been increased by recent wage advances.    In France, the shortage of labour is still restricting output and, as the amount of Italian labour which can be obtained is limited, attempts are being made to bring Austrian workers into the heavy Industries of France.      It is reported that the Fabrique de fer de Charleroi is intending to erect a new steelworks which,  it is expected, will be finished by the spring of 1931&quot;NON-FERROUS METALS.CAPTAIN LYTTELTON wrote:-&quot;I have nothing special to report regarding the non-ferrous metal trade, except to say that the demand, for all the metals has been well maintained, whilst the buying of copper during the last few days has been strong&quot;.ENGINEERING.SIR iiRNEST PETTER said that in general engineering the year had opened well;    although, of course, outside work, constructional engineering, shipbuilding, &amp;c. had been very much affected by the severe weather.      The January returns of engineering were encouraging:    the engineering exports for January were 50,175 tons, compared with 50,176 tons for
BNG-INEERING- ( CONTD.) .January, 1923; so that showed a good beginning.As regards unecploym en t, the figures for January when compared with December showed badly;    while compared  /ith November they were still not good, but were relatively not seriously up.      in certain branches of engineering, marine engineering and shipbuilding, unemployment was less, for in November it had been 16.5/3 and in January lC.4y-i.    This was very largely a question of the weather; but the orders in hand, were pretty satisfactory.MR. RICHMOND reported that in marine engineering the month of February had not been conspicuous for much improve-ment in respect of new orders. On the north-east coast, however, there had been a steady maintenance of new work for the last month or so, but on the Clyde a distinct lack of orders had been apparent since the beginning of February. The vessels placed, had been chiefly of the cargo-carrying type. on the Tyne as well as the Clyde there had been a good amount of repair work, due possibly to the bad weather.On the Clyde much interest had been centred on the trials of the P. &amp; 0.  turbo-electric vessel &quot;Viceroy of India&quot;, 17,000 a.h.p., and although no details of her performance were yet available, and those responsible for her engine and electrical equipment were not laying stress upon efficiency, there were many features for special services which appeared to offer considerable advantage.    Her equipment had aroused great interest in marine engineering circles, and had. added another field of development to the marine engineer, and possibly another source of perplexity to the shipowner.    The large white Star Atlantic liner no.v being laid down at Belfast was also to be electrically propelled, although the decision as to .whether the prime movers //ere to be Diesel engines or steam turbine^1 had not yet been made public.Unemployment was still bad, but there was a considerable amount of work in hand which should reach a stage by April and May to improve the present figures.    The orders placed at the enci of last year and the beginning of this year had not actually taken effect in the shops.    The new naval programme would not affect the position till later in the year, as the work was only now in process of being placed, but about a million and a half sterling was to be spent on that this year.The tfages question had been the subject of a national conference to discuss the policy to be adopted in regard to the claim for a national advance.    The report of the sub-committee appointed to investigate was referred to the executives of the various unions for consideration, and a further meeting of the conference was fixed for a date in May to consider what action should be taken; but everything as regards that was moving very satisfrctorily.General engineering in Scotland was rather better on the whole-Locomotive builders had received some good orders , and the motor vehicle trade was, generally speaking, active, as also the
ENGINEERING  (CONTD. ).lighter branches, which were well engaged.    Tool makers reported fair business, and considered that the recent development In high speed steel would necessitate revised designs to utilise it, and provide further work for them.    The heavy tool makers were doing rather better.   Structural engineers, although complaining of prices, were well employed and anticipated a continuance of this during the summer.ELECTRICAL INDUSTRY,SIR PHILIP NASH reported that there had not been any change in the market for electrical engineering plant.    The home market was fairly busy, the biggest buyer at the moment being the Central Electricity Board,   But for their orders, at the moment  he home market would be pretty slack.    Their orders were mainly for machinery such as transformers and switch gear. The Central Electricity Board were not yet creating a demand for other electrical apparatus;   but their activities would result in more power being sold, and as soon as the grid, as it was called, was in working order, there would be a stimulated demand for the extension of power houses, and power would be provided at places where it could not be provided today at an economic price.    The preliminary figures for last year appeared to show that there was a 15$ increase in the consumption of electricity in &quot;the country, which was a very good figure.Sir Philip Nash thought that the export market, was normal: there was nothing very important to refer to, but the amount of small work coming in from the export market today was Increasing, which was a good sign.   As plants were equipped in Australia and elsewhere, the demand for electricity in the factories and so forth was increasing in a very hopeful way.   For cables the demand seemed just about normal.    The cable market last year had shown a little increase over the year before, and there was the promise of a slight increase again this year.MOTOR INDUSTRY.SIR GILBERT VXLE stated that he had had a report from Coventry, through Mr. Mitchell, which was rather interesting; it showed that the motor industry had had a kind of check, though only temporary, owing to the very bad weather recently experienced, but that a fairly optimistic note prevailed. They were well satisfied with some of the new productions that had been turned out;    and it was interesting to know that the overseas trade was being pushed forward, and quite as many cars were being sent to Australia as there had been a year ago.    In spite of very keen American competition a firm had received an order from the police in Australia for 25 &quot;Flying Eight&quot; motor cycles.    Hitherto the whole of the police motor cycles had been furnished by the United States, which had made a speciality of heavy motor cycles.
MOTOR INDUSTRY CONTD. ).SIR C. HURCOME observed that the returns of new registrations of motor vehicles forwarded to the Ministry of Transport showed an improvement during the quarter ended 30th November last as compared with the same quarter of the previous year.     For the last two years we had got these special returns from the licensing authorities, to show the vehicles which had been registered for the first time,.    That Information was of great interest to the   manufact&amp;rers, as it indicated the trend of demand and how far new vehicles in the several categories were being actually brought into use.    The detailed analyses were very helpful for this purpose.SIR GIIBERT VYLE pointed out that the present licensing system was giving rl3e to a good deal of criticism in the trade.    The pound per horse-power basis, no matter how much justification there had been for It, was certainly hurting our export trade to a very large extent.   Very few people could afford to pay  35 a year for their taxation.    He knew that it was all a question of finance, but the suggestion had, on the other hand, been made that If the tax of one pound per horse-power were to stop at, say,  20, so as to facilitate&apos; the turning out of the 30 or 50 horse-power car, It would hurt the home trade, as  the export trade would be favoured in respect of a higher horse-power car than was being used in this country,THE PRESIDENT observed that he had looked into this system with the motor trade, and had found that opinion was really rather divided.    He thought that the more general contention might fairly be described as follows;    that, although the present system did to some extent militate against the export trade, yet, if they had to choose between the present horse-power tax and a very low horse-power tax or no horse-power tax at all, with the import duty left as it was, they thought that on   the whole they would lose by changing the present system, because a horse-power tax acted as a kind of protection.    Certainly the suggestion had been put to him that, if the horse-power tax were tackled,  it ought to be accompanied by an increase in the import duty.   But the import duty was already high, and therefore he did not think it was a practical proposition to raise it further.SIR GILBERT VYLE remarked that the trade wanted to induce all their designers to design down to the minimum high speed horse-power, and that type of engine was not the engine that people wanted in the export trade.THE PRESIDENT agreed, but said that on the other hand the trade had told him that the bulk of their business was in the home market, and at the present time they got their double protection;    they got their 33V3  Import duty and they got the horse-power tax, which was a further protection against the American high-powered car.    He was bound to say that the impression they had left in his mind was that they would, on the whole, rather leave the matter as it stood.
MOTOR INDUSIRl  (CUNTD.).SIR GILBERT VILE added that there was the possibility of stopping the horse-power tax at some given figure&apos;.    Coventry was very much concerned in this matter, and was anxious to get into the bigger-englned motor trade abroad.    The only way to do it was to cultivate a market here for a bigger horse-power car than obtained at present.    He thought the whole matter was summed up In that.COTTON.THE PRESIDENT said ha was very glad to see the progress that was being made with the Lancashire Cotton Corporation; it was satisfactory to note that the cotton operatives had come out with a strong defence of the scheme.SIR K. STEWART said that the action of the trade unions was much appreciated and the scheme appeared to be getting quite a fair support in a number of directions.    There was also, however,  a good deal of opposition, because a good many people wrould lose their employment on account of it.    At present, the affairs of something like 83 cotton mills were under investigation.    In some process or other between 110 and 120 were being dealt with, but with 83 mills a considerable progress had been made.    They comprised about 9 million spindles, and this result had been attained after only a month.    The aim was to reach a total of 10 million spindles, but naturally there were a good many stages yet when many of these mills would be able to drop out of the scheme if they wished to.    On the other hand,  it was known that about another couple of hundred were more or less interested.    A long way had to be traversed yet, because a great deal of business would be necessary over liquidation and over arrange-ments of all sorts and kinds\ at the same time the Corporation were not dissatisfied with the progress they were making.As regards the trade in general, the first three weeks of February had been marked by an absence of interest in business, largely owing to slackness in the  astern market. This was caused by holidays in China - China still keeping its lunar New lear at the beginning of February.    Bombay also had holidays early&quot; in FebruaryJ and a ban on March/May shipments to Calcutta had been successfully imposed by the Marwari dealers.    In the last few years the big dealers in Calcutta had been closing down, for a certain number of months in the year, on any fresh business being done there.    They had been doing this very successfully to prevent large stocks accumulating.    The result was that at the beginning of this month there, were few orders coming in for Calcutta and that had an enormous effect on business generally - combined with the holidays.    Outside these markets business had been rather quiet all the month.    But during the last ten days or so there had been a considerable change In China, Bombay and Calcutta, where increased activity had been shown; and altogether there had been more enquiry all round and quite an active demand which showed some sign of continuing.
COTTON (CONTD.).With regard to the fine end of the trade, it would have been seen that for the first time for seven years there had been an organised short time..    It was probably not anything more than a temporary lull, and there seemed to be no reason to believe that it would remain as anything permanent.    In some ways it was rather a good move as a temporary expedient to get over temporary slackness of demand.MR. LiiE wrote :-&quot;As far as the heavy &quot;bread    and cheese&apos;  trade is concerned, my information leads me to believe that it is certainly no worse than a month ago, and I should think It might even be said to have made some little progress.    For the fine trade, the short time movement, -which I think I referred, to in my last report, has come into operation. Practically the whole of that trade is now running SS-y3fj short time,  the feeling being that it is very necessary to reduce the extra stocks that have accumulated,  to normal dimensions, and also that the short time may have a good effect on the prices of some grades of Egyptian cotton which are out of parity with the market.    It is too soon to report the effects of this movement, but I hope that when I come tc the next meeting of the Council I may be able to give an exact report or the position of affairs.&quot;WOOL.SIR FREDERIC A1KR0YD stated that  the trade  In the West  tiding of Yorkshire had shewn a slight improvement in the last month.    Prices had fallen somewhat in the primary markets and this had undoubtedly stimulated business and more orders had been placed.    The cross-bred market had been fighting the high level of prices for the last four months, so it would be seen that a lower level was welcome , and came at a time -when buyers were desirous of placing business.    The fine section of the trade was keeping fairly busy, and here again the lower basis of values was assisting trade.it was still doubtful whether the business which had been done during the last few weeks was speculative or from genuine orders.    uwing to the very high cost of production, speculation, or an attempt to put oneself  into a good position regarding prices, was very common, and this fact often made it difficult to tell whether there was genuine trade or not.    There was an increasing number of mills in the market for sale;    only the previous week one small mill at Meltham had been sold, and another at Dewsbury, which ten years ago cost  6,000 and was sold for  3,300.    The buyers were mainly speculators, though he believed that in Huddersfield one or&apos; two mills had been sold and pulled down and the materials used up.
WOOL.   (CONTD . )Japan had been one of  the chief factors in keeping the pries level where it was.    Their demand had -widened consider-ably, and covered more    qualities than formerly, and the effect of this In the primary markets had to be kept In mind. The large quantity of machinery which Japan had taken during recent years was a real source of trouble to us ; each year their manufacturing increased and coincided with decreased shipments of semi and fully manufactured goods from the United Kingdom to that market.      Material assistance was -iven, he was told, by the Japanese Government in the payment of raw material.In the combing section,  top-making combers were running fairly well, and commission combers slightly better than in the previous month.    In &quot;worsted spinning the position was practically the same, with no signs of improvement.    The woollen and worsted manufacturers in the Dewsbury area reported the position to be as bad. as possible, with not more than half the looms running.      The Yeadon and Guisele:f district was a bright    spot;    every firm there was working overtime.     Fashion seemed to have turned towards their products, and woollen tweeds from this district were much in demand.      It was believed that the application for a safe-guarding duty was also having a material influence upon this trade, though prices were very much cut;    people were placing orders in England because  they thought there would be a duty, and if they gave a foreign order,  it might have to bear the duty.Some trouble had been felt in regard to the Irish Free State market.    New rates of duty amounting to 25 per cent, ad valorem on all wool goods weighing over 7 ozs. per sq.yd. and &quot;costing more than 1/6 per sq., yd.   (with a preferential rate of 20 per cent,  on goods of British Empire origin or manufacture) had been applied -as from the 21st February. Instances had been furnished to the Board of Trade where goods were consigned from Bradford on the 18th up to the 20th February and were In the hands of the Free State Customs in good time, but yet had been assessed at the new rates.     Many firms had consignments held up on this account and it was hoped, that the Free Stats would be persuaded not to persist in charging these consignments at the new rates.Sir F. Aykroyd also had reports of increased trade with Russia.    A large amount of tops and raw material had been bought from Bradford ; and Bradford houses. which a month ago had difficulty in finding, employment, now had. an increased staff and were working overtime.    The Russians were being given four months&apos;  credit and the Bradford houses had drawn up and were getting accepted a very strict contract.    He believed the risk was being taken simply because of lack of business.
Hi1)&apos;:i jl *jWOOL (CONTD. )MR ARTHUR SHAW wrote:-&quot;There has been very little alteration in the  situation throughout the West Riding of Yorkshire during February, as compared&apos;with my report of last mouth, except in the Yeadon District, where the unemployment has now reached a very low percentage.   Mills are working full time,,and new night turns have been started.    This is very typical of the Yeadon and Guiseley trade, in which section, in 1927, the number of unemployed rapidly decreased from February to the end of June, and increased from that time to the second week in February1928.   Trade then imoroved in February and March 1928, but the recovery was&quot;not so great,  and Unemployment has been very severe until the back end of January this year.&quot;Unemployment is still very heavy in the Batley and Dewsbury District.   Halifax has slightly improved, mainly in the spinning ,section of the industry.    In Hud.dersf ield, unemployment is still severe, with an average of approximately 20% signing our registers.   Unfortunately, I am not in a position to give strictly accurate figures, owing to the operation of the new regulations with the Minister of Labour.   Under these regulations, members of the Trade Union who are not entitled to Trade Union Unemployment Benefit must roister at the Employment Exchange, and not at the office of the Trade Union, thus preventing the Trade Union from giving a correct percentage of the total number of unemployed of its membership.    The position in the Bradford, Keighley and Shipley areas is slightly better, but unemployment Is still nearly three times as heavy as during the same period last year.&quot;I still believe that the application made for Safeguarding is reflected in the unsteady position of the industry.&quot;Following the tables which were submitted last month, I attach a table of comparisons between 1924 (considered to be a reasonably normal year) and 1928, giving figures of trade with Japan and Australia which are two of the countries that show the greatest reduction in the woollens and worsteds taken from us.    I am of the opinion that very little of this trade will be recovered, and that It will be necessary for our manufacturers to open up new markets.    On the other hand, the principal countries where an increase is shown in our export trade In woollens and. worsted are as follows:-Increase in our Exports of 7oollen &amp; Worsted Tissuesin 1928 over 1924.Germany.............Argentine...........British South Africa4.93 million sq.yds. 2.25     &quot; &quot;1.63     &quot;

The exports of Worsted tissues to China (including Hong Kong) have heen maintained, but the exports of Woollen tissues have decreased by 8.4 million square yardsHOSIERY. BOOTS AFP SHOES.MR. WALKER reported that manufacturers of hosiery, footwear and of outerwear had been fairly well employed, but in the underwear section they were still far from busy.    Speaking for the trade generally, employment was only moderately good and a considerable amount of short tiine was    being worked.
4.1 At   A  VtLHOSIERY. BOOTS AND SHOES  (CONTD.)A point of interest regarding the silk duties was that, since their imposition, there had been a great demand for machinery for making ladies1 full-fashioned silk hose, and the English makers had so many orders that they could not undertake delivery under a year.    The machines were expensive and often cost more than  2,000.    Orders had had to be placed in Germany, and he v;as told that there were no less than 18 setters-up of machines in this country at present assembling German machines. That gave some Idea of the demand for this type of machinery.In the boot and shoe industry, while many individual manufacturers complained of quietness in the home trade, there had undoubtedly been a gradual improvement in the volume of orders for the spring and summer trade, and employment had improved somewhat during the past month.   Trade was better than a month ago, though below normal for the period of the year, and compared with a year ago it was by no means so good.   The trade had been suffering through depressed conditions In other centres, the unsettled state of the leather market, and also the unseasonable weather.CHEMICALS.MR. HILL said that the February chemical trade had been tolerably active as compared with that of the months immediately preceding, and there was a better general tone than hitherto, an exception, however, being in the Lancashire area, where depression In consuming industries had caused a corresponding slackness in heavy chemical business.    The position in that area was consequently less satisfactory than a year ago, though not substantially changed from that at the end of 1928 and January, 1S29,    The expected recovery in the iron and steel industry, If It materialised, would reflect itself in the heavy chemical market.   On the other hand, there was a certain amount of depression In the artificial silk industry, which was less active.Last month Mr.   Hill had reported a general reduction In the price of dyes by Imperial Chemical Industries, and that had since been followed by a similar move in respect of the same products by other firms, who were making a fair bid for their share in the trade.     That action had met with considerable success, resulting in healthy competition which, if it did not develop into a regular price war, ought to be a good thing for the dye consumers.   More business seemed to be coming in.The chemical section of the British Industries Fair had been, on the whole, in spite of the severe cold, as satisfactory as in previous years, principally owing to the better attendance of home buyers, rather than overseas buyers.The extreme depression which had for so long characterized the Brioish superphosphate Industry had not been ameliorated to any appreciable extent during the past twelve months, though the Board of Trade statistics of imports of superphosphate for
CHEMICALS  (CONTD. )the year 1928 showed a reduction In tonnage brought in from foreign sources as compared with the year 1927.    The rather paradoxical position had arisen that there was a reduction of imports without increased prosperity for the British industry. Early in the spring of 1928, as a result of certain domestic difficulties in Prance, prices in that country had fallen to exceptionally low levels, - very substantially below the cost of production.    French manufacturers in a position to export had begun to make offers to buyers in this country at the equivalent of the internal French prices, and had. effected sales at low prices all over Great Britain.    The Dutch and Belgian sellers had in many cases declined to follow the French to these low levels, with the result that their sales had been on a very much reduced tonnage basis, while naturally the French sales to this country increased.    The reduction in Dutch and Belgian exports was greater than the French increase: hence on balance the total quantity showed a reduction.    The statistical position of the superphosphate industry for the fertiliser year ending June 30th, 1928, was as follows: manufactured during the year., 496,471 tons, and sales during the year (including exports) 510,551 tons, leaving a surplus of 14,000, which was, of course, exactly balanced by the reduction of stock.    The total imports into the British Isles (the whole of Great Britain and the Irish Free State) were 161,708 tons.The fine chemical industry, and especially the drug Industry, had been quite exceptionally busy so far this year.GAS INDUSTRIES,sir D. MILNE WATSON stated that the price of residuals -tar and tar products - unfortunately remained low.    There would in consequence, however, be an increase in tar used In the summer for roadmaking purposes.    Pitch prices tended to show a slight decline.    Creosote exports to the United States were to be reduced in future,  in accordance with an arrangement which had been enforced on British producers by the American producers.   Tie were trying to give effect to that In this country:    it was difficult to do so, but we were trying to reduce the exports.There had been a great demand for gas and coke in the past few months owing to the very cold weather.    There had been an absolute record In the amount of gas used day after day.    This great demand for gas had given rise to a considerable extra use of coal.    The Gas Light and Coke Company alone used over 70,000 tons of coal extra in the first few weeks of the year,.    They had started their low carbonisation plant at Richmond&apos;:    it was rather too early to say how the enterprise was working, but, so far, the fuel turned out appeared to be considered satisfactory, and to go further than ordinary coal.RUBBER.MR. JOHNSTON observed that the rubber industry on the whole had been rather disappointing during the past month.    The tyre
CONPIISSNTIAL .RUBBER  (COETD.Jsection had been particularly affected, demand being very poor, largely due, no doubt, to the severe weather which had greatly restricted motoring.    When finer weather came this shortage of sales would probably be made up, but in the meantime manufacturers were working almost entirely for stock. The rubber footwear section had been rather slack, and although the severe weather had caused an increased public demand; this had been mostly in the direction of depleting retailers&apos; stocks and had not affected, production, although naturally it was a satisfactory feature.    In general rubber goods, demand and production were about normal.    It was an ill wind that blew nobody any good, and hot rater bottle sales had been abnormal owing to the cold weather.The export trade generally had been up to expectation for the time of year;    continental sales had improved, slightly,but exports to the Dominions were not good.   Employment continued about normal.    On the whole, although the results for the last two months had not been very satisfactory and a considerable amount of prod\iction had been for stock, there was no reason to suppose that this was anything but a temporary lull.It might be of interest to mention that the Soviet Rubber Trust was showing increased activity, and,  in Turkey, was taking steps to capture the market at prices which appeared to be entirely uneconomic.    On the other hand it was reported that it was practically impossible for the peasantry In Russia to buy rubber shoes,which  there were practically a necessity of life. It seemed as if, when money was needed, Russia was prepared to unload goods in Europe without regard to cost.    Mr.Johns ton thought that, if the Industrialists who were to visit Russia sought to supply rubber machinery for Russia, it might lead to the dumping of rubber goods from Russia all over the world.BANK RATE INCREASE.SIR ERNEST PETTER observed that the increase in the bank rate at the end of January was a serious matter for industry, and its occurrence early In the year, which had begun well and from which much was hoped, could only be described as regrettable.    It was too early yet to estimate the full effect, but the needs of Industry demanded that a reduction should be made at the earliest possible moment.    It was not, however, the rate of interest that affected. Industry so much as the scarcity of credit and consequent restriction which was Involved in the increase.THE PRESIDENT asked whether Sir Ernest Petter had known of any scarcity of credit actually arising as the result of the recent bank rate increase.    The bank returns shoved that there had been a tremendous increase in advances in the last year or two, something like 272 millions.    Pigttr ;s that the banks had given showed that 90 per cent of that, or more, was purely industrial.
BANK RATE INCREASE  (CONTD. )SIR ERNEST PETTED replied that he could not say that he was aware of any evidence of actual restriction on the part of the banks at the present time, but the object of the Increase in the bank rate must be restriction.THE PRESIDENT said that the object was to attract gold back here.    It did not necessarily mean that Internal credit would be restricted.    It would only have that effect If industry could not pay the Increased rate.SIR ERNEST PETTER agreed, but observed that the real aim must be the conservation of bank credit.    The rate was put up in order to achieve that end, - whether towards Industry at horns or in respect of money ^oing out of the countryj    it applied in both directions.    But he would not say that there was any Immediate indication of an alteration of policy on the part of the banks  .. towards industry here.SIR. GILBERT VYLE asked whether the real position was not that we had been supplying a lot of money for speculation in America, which had caused a shortage here;    therefore we had to put the rate up as a defensive measure to bring the gold back here, as the President had said.SIR ERNEST PETTER observed that it might be put In this way:-   industry, with the cheap money which it had before, could do this, that, and the other, which it could not do with money at Its present price;    and to that extent it was affected.THE PRESIDENT said that the only way really to test the effect of a particular rate of money was to ascertain whether credit was being in fact restricted;    and restriction could operate in two ways, either by the banks cutting down their loans to industry, or by industry itself - In view of the rate prevailing - asking for less.   But there was no particular evidence yet as to the effect of the recent increase.LORD EBBISHAM wrote as follows:-&quot;The most unsatisfactory feature of the outlook continues to be the monetary situation.    The increase in the bank   rate to 5%fi is a specially ominous sign, indicating, as it apparently does, a breakdown of the informal co-operation between the Bank of England and the New York Federal Reserve Board, which, until recently, had been operating as a reassuring and stabilising influence.    It is Impossible at the moment to foresee whether there will be a general rise in the American Reserve rates, or, even if this should be avoided, whether our own bank rate will remain where it Is.&quot;It Is important to. realise, however, that even if a further increase In our own bank   rate is avoided, the position must continue to be difficult for some time.   From the point of view of this country, the effective United States monetary rate
BANK RATE INCREASE  (CONTD. )is not the 5^ re-discount rate, hut is somewhere round about the 6^fS level.    The result is that the present Increase in our bank rate is not likely to do more than check the further out-flow of British funds;    it is extremely unlikely to stimulate the much-needed return flow of gold.    This means that, with France and Germany maintaining what is in effect an embargo on the outflow of gold from their territories, the only sources from which the Bank of England can hope to replenish her depleted reserves during the coming months are such portions of the supplies of new gold coming forward from South Africa as she can secure in open competition,  together with any privately arranged special shipments from the United States or elsewhere which the joint stock banks or other financial institutions may have the good fortune to be able to effect on her behalf.&quot;GENERAL TRADE.SIR GILBERT &quot;VYLE said that he had had an opportunity of going round the country since the last meeting of the Council, and the feeling of improvement that he had then reported still continued;    the improvement seemed to be fairly general.   He thought that what had been said last time had been borne out and confirmed by what had really happened during the month. There were no signs of great enthusiasm indeed, because there was such a large leeway to pull up, but things certainly looked more hopeful.Export business was going fairly well in heavy engineering, but they could do with a little more home trade.MR. MITCHELL stated that the reports he had received showed that in Hull the seed crushing trade kept dull, with a disappointing demand for cakes which pointed to lack of buying power srcongst farmers generally.    In the paint trade the home demand continued to be very quiet and employment in the mills had only been poor.    There was a slight favourable movement in the export trade.    Shipping was not brisk, though freights had improved to a small extent and there was a slightly better demand for tonnage.    The timber trade showed a small improvement stocks were still fairly heavy.    Imports of reheat were somewhat down, but maize and other cereals showed an increase.    Values of wheat were higher than last month.    The fruit trade remained satisfactory on the whole;    good prices were being realised and there was an improving demand for all kinds of fruit.As to Liverpool,  the volume of traffic passing between thi country and West Africa was encouraging in so far that the offerings of cargo, both out and home, had during the past few months been larger than at any time during the last six or seven years.    It was, perhaps, yet too early to judge to what extent the increased cargoes v;ere due to seasonal demands in Fest Africa, but It would at least appear that more money was circulating among the African producers than had been the case for some time past.    This was particularly noteworthy In view of the large amount of money which must have been withdrawn from
/HQI General TRADE  (CQHTU. )circulation among the cocoa farmers on the Gold Coast as a result of the fall in cocoa prices.    Demand for palm oil during January had been fairly steady and in all grades showed increases over January 1928.    There had been a limited enquiry for spot consignments of Accra cocoa.    The Continental market had been quiet, but activity in the spot market in America had shown a tendency to revive towards the end of January.In Nottingham the hosiery trade was about normal for the time of year.   Recent cold weather had helped to reduce stocks of winter underwear, but the manufacturing end was very lulet. Ladles&apos; underwear In fine cotton, cotton and artificial silk mixture, and artificial silk, was In good demand, while trade in artificial silk hose and real silk hose was rather better. The outerwear trade also improved.    It was now the buying time for autumn delivery in Canada, the United States of America, Holland and Scandinavia, and it appeared from reports to hand that orders would be placed in average bulk.    Business with New Zealand and South Africa was about normal,    As regards lace curtains, It could be said, generally, that more business was now coming through both for the home and overseas markets.LORD EBBISHAM wrote as follows:-&quot;The trade movements of the month have been mainly of a seasonal character, the most notable feature being the continued expansion of our export trade.    The heavy basic industries have shown signs of increasing activity, the ship-building industry being supplied with a fair number of orders, while the coal and the steel trades have both exhibited signs of improving conditions.    The least promising features are in the textile trades j    the recent fall in the price of wool has affected production in the wool trade, and the Indian riots, together with the decision of the Egyptian cotton spinners to work short time, are unfavourable points in the cotton situation.&quot;Summing up the general situation, there appears to be nothing to indicate that anything more than the customary seasonal movements is under way, unless the steady,  though slow, progressive expansion of the export trade represents a more permanent tendency.&quot;Among the reports on particular trades are the following: Boots and Shoes, The past month has witnessed only a very slight improvement in the condition of the boot and shoe trade,  though it is anticipated that, with the approach of the Spring season, a number of bulk orders will be placed with the manufacturers.    At the moment buyers generally appear to be delaying the placing of orders for the new season.Hosiery.    The past month witnessed a slight improvement in the hosiery trade, not only on home, but also on foreign account.    In the latter case the operation of certain import duties appears to be holding up business at the moment.
GENERAL TRADE  (CONTD.)Chemicals,.  The chemical market is reported to have been rather better during February, and fair business has been done, especially on the export side.   Prices were fairly firm.    In the pharmaceutical section, conditions have been rather less active during the last few weeks, whilst among perfumery chemicals prices   have been somewhat uneven,    A fuller report with regard to the chemical industry will be presented by Mr, Hill&quot;,  (see Chemical section).Retail Trade.SIR V/. BURBIDGE stated that a combination of different circumstances had made February a black month for the retail trade.    Even under favourable circumstances it was generally regarded as a&apos; dull month, as there was inevitably a reaction after the sales which marked the end of the financial year in January, and the spring demand had not had time to materialise.Peports from all over the country showed a substantially lower turnover.    Stores    in the North reported a fall of from 15 per cent, to 20 per cent, and stated that the decreases throughout the various departments were fairly uniform. A few instances were reported in the North where the turn-over had been maintained, but only with the greatest difficulty, and generally with the assistance of certain favourable factors not common to the retail trade as a whole. Stores in outer London also reported decreased sales as compared with the corresponding month last year, and the West End stores did not appear to have fared any better. In the South of   England the set-back was not, perhaps, on quite so severe a scale.    In Wales, on the other hand, retail trade appeared to have been particularly hard hit by the weather conditions;    with snow lying, on the ground for almost three weeks continuously, communications had been disorganised and sales affected accordingly.    The serious unemployment in the building and. associated trades, owing to the continuous frost,  combined with the other unfavourable factors In producing these results, while at the same time there was no proportionate increase in sales of winter clothing, because purchasers were naturally reluctant to invest       heavy underclothing and outer-wear so late in the season.    It should be borne in mind, however, that the comparison was made with the exceptionally good results of February 1928.Co-operative Wholesale Society.MR, HAYRTJRST sent a report to the following effect:-During the past month, the sales have been of the usual character, and In comparison with the month of February of last year, have held their own from every standpoint.    In some
*  ftj JLGENERAL TRADE  (CONTD. )Co-operative   Wholesale Society (Contd. )instances, however, prices have been affected b&apos;y the abnormal atmospherical conditions which naturally handicapped very severely transport facilities, particularly in Scandinavia. Our total sales for the year 1928 were over  87 millions sterling, a sxVbstantial increase over 1927, notwithstanding the extraordinary depression which has been so rife in the North-Eastern and South Wales Districts, and if I may be permitted to say so, reflect very greatly the confidence which the working classes of the country have in the Co-operative Movement.The production of goods, both in the food and textile factories, has been satisfactory, and the month closed with stocks held of a   usual character, not calling for any special comment on my part.Provisions.    The whole of Denmark has been handicapped during the past few weeks to a degree almost unparallelled. Many harbours are entirely closed for navigation, and those navigable have only been kept free at great expense.   Butters have, therefore, had to be sent overland to secure shipment. The market for New Zealand cheese has been active, and increased buying has been a feature.    The September make of Canadian is of good quality, and of excellent value, with a steady demand. Cheshire and Lancashire makes have been in steady demand, but naturally, the cold weather has considerably curtailed supplies. Wheat on spot and in near positions is In small compass and firmly held.    Flour has shown an easier tendency in price, and millers have bought very sparingly.    The severe weather in Europe recently and the fear of damage to winter wheat crops in the ground have caused markets to close firmly.    Maize has ruled quiet during the latter part of the month;   whilst the demand has been good, it has not been affected by the cold weather.    Liverpool stocks closed at 106,400 quarters, which is rather less than a month&apos;s supply.    The potato trade has been very seriously Interfered with on account of the frost, the weather having practically stopped loading, leaving the markets very bare.    As regards bacon and hams, continental conditions have been extremely unfavourable.    Ice-blocked waters and other transport difficulties prevented free and easy shipments, and have found their reflection in a shortage of pig supplies and killings, with the result that firmness in the market has been maintained for the limited quantities available.    Higher prices, however, failed to find   - a responsive demand on this side, and at the close of the month a quieter tone appeared in the trade. Home consumption of tea, and also exports, have continued good, while the stocks on hand have slightly lessened.    The cocoa market has been greatly disturbed during the month, owing to the difficulties of the great British combine, the African Eastern Corporation, who had to unload some of their stocks.    In West Africa prices fell to as low as 38/-.    The farmers began to refuse to sell, as at 40/- the planting only just pays, but during&apos;the past fortnight prices have hardened in West Africa and at home by some 7/-.    American stocks between August and December dropped from 29,000 tons to 11,000 tons, so that It looks as If further buying will have to take place for them before the season closes In a fortnight at Accra.

A 9 QtPCONEIUEHTIAL.RAILWAY TRAFFIC.SLk C. HURCoivio stated that the receipts of the four railway groups from all traffics showed a decline of  656-000 in the eight weeks ended 24th February, of which a decline of about  526,000 occurred in the last&apos;four weeks. The coal receipts in the eight weeks showed an increase of  487,000:    not quite enough&quot;to offset the decline in other merchandise, which &quot;was  662,000.    But on the freight-carrying as a whole, the decline, as would be seen, -was not very serious.    There had been a decline in the passenger receipts of  481,000,  just about equivalent to the increase in the coal receipts.    The railways were suffering very much from the continuuL aecline in their passenger carryings.    The figures for December were interesting in that respect:    the railways, excluding the London Tubes, carried about a million lesn people in December 1928 than they did in December 1927; but they had carried 6i million people less at the standard or ordinary fares and 5-g- million people more at the reduced fares.      There had accordingly been a big transfer from travel at full fares to travel at the various cheap fares which had been put into operation to meet road competition.    The result was that there was still a decline in the total receipts from passenger traffic.SIR JOSIAH STAMP wrote&quot;A comparison of the Traffic Receipts of the four railway Groups for the eight weeks ending 23rd February, 1929, with the corresponding period in 1928, shows the following results.&quot;The Passenger Train Receipts are down 5 per cent, decreases being recorded on each Group, as under:-	 	%	208,000	5.8	125,000	5.2	74,000	4.7	74,000	5.6	481,000	5.0&quot;Merchandise, Other Minerals and Live Stock receipts show a decrease of  661,800 or 6.5 per cent, in total7 each Company&apos;s share of the losses boing:-	 			6.7		7.8	67,000	3 ,9	29 ,500	4.9		6 .5

PHILLIPS observed that the chief feature in the unemployment figures for February was the large increase of ever  115,000 on 18th February.    This was obviously due, not to any set back in trade, but to stoppages caused by frost and snow.    In fact, the Ministry of Labour estimated that the total unemployment due to this cause was between 140,000 and 150,000. On the 25th February there was a recovery to the extent of 66,000, but this left the figures only slightly lower than at the end of January.The average live register figure for the four weeks ending 25th February was 1,390,000 as compared with 1,446,000 in the previous five weeks.One point which might have some significance -was that so far this year the southern parts of the country did not seem to be doing   so well as they had been previously, and this helped to some extent to account for the high level of the general figures of unemployment.

AUSTRALIAN TRADE.SIR FREDERICK YOUNG sent a report to the following effect:The trade of the Commonwealth of Australia for the six months ended 31st December 1928 shows decreases in value of both exports and imports.    The value of imports for the period was  72,791,200, being  8,151,900 less than for the corresponding period of the previous year;    the value of exports was  68,793,250, representing a reduction of  3,016,000.    The decline in the export figures was  due mainly to lower wool values, while the heaviest decreases in the import figures were those relating to metals and machinery, apparel and textiles.Wool received into store between the 1st July and 31st January amounted to 2,426,556 bales, showing a slight increase on the corresponding period a year ago.   Rather more than half has been sold.    The average price at Melbourne for greasy wool during the period was 17,14d per lb.    The demand remains satisfactory,   Weather conditions have recently been favourable to the dairying industry, and increased production has resulted.    The fair average quality wheat standard for Western Australia has been fixed at 621- lbs, for the 1928/29 season.The Minister for Markets introduced into the House of Representatives a Wine Overseas Marketing Bill which provides for the   creation of a board to control the export and market-Ing overseas of Australian wines,   A poll of wine makers will be taken and, unless the result be favourable, the board will not be established.    The   Minister Is taking special care this season to prevent the export of immature apples and pears and also to ensure strict observance of the prescribed standards for all Australian fruit.   Under the New South Wales State Marketing of Primary Produce Act, an egg marketing board has been established and a honey marketing board has been decided upon.The appointment of Mr. F;. A. Eaynes as Australian commercial representative in Canada which was reported, in the newspapers is confirmed.    Mr. Eaynes&apos; headquarters will be Toronto.INDIAN TRADE.MR, LINDSAY stated that the final forecast of the cotton crop was now available, showing a serious decline during the last month owing to adverse   weather conditions.    There was a decrease of 800,000 bales In the estimate, owing to frost in different parts of the country.    Last year -the crop exceeded five million bales, and the February forecast for this year was actually six million, though it had now dropped to 5,200,000.    That, however, would still leave a good surplus for exports.    The reports as to other crops were satisfactory.In January he had --.Iven the Council an estimate of the Indian Import and export trade figures for 1928, and he was
INDIAN TRAPS   (CONTD. )now able to give them with more accuracy.   Exports were  253,000,000, imports  186,000,000, and net imports of treasure    27,000,000.    The interesting point about these figures was their relation with the pre-war trade.    Imports had gone up from  100,000,000 to  186,000,000, a rise oi* 86 per cent;    exports had gone up from  150,000,000 to  253,000,000, a rise of only 66 per cent.    Of course the percentage was affected by the rise in the value of the rupee from l/4 to 1/6, and if that was taken into account the value of the imports in 1928 was 70 per cent, over pre-war, and the exports 50 per cent.    The proportional figures were rather surprising when it was considered that Indians import trade was certainly suffering more than her export trade, and the position was due entirely to the fact that the majority of the imports were manufactures, while the majority of &quot;the exports were raw materials.    There was still a gap between the price India had to pay for manufactured articles and the price she got for her produce,  the reason for that distinction being presumably the increased costs of manufacture, including taxation and other charges since the war.    In this connection Mr. Lindsay referred to the price index numbers for raw cotton and cotton manufactures in India during 1928. Both figures stood at 60 per cent, over pre-war, which, showed the serious position of the manufacturer, who had to pay 60 per cent more for his raw material and only received 60 per cent more for his manufactured products, in spite   of the greater percentage increase in manufacturing costs, including taxation.    In the normal Industry, the rise^in the cost of the raw material since before the war was something like 40 per cent, while the rise in the price of the finished article was something like 50 per cent.    There seemed to be a gap between the two, because the costs of manufacture had gone up by a relatively greater amount.    That fact accounted for the greater rise in the value of Indian imports than In the exports.COLONIAL TRADE.MR. B0YB gave the Council some comparative figures for 1927 and 1928.    First, as regards Kenya and Uganda, a return from the East African Dependencies Trade and Information Office showed that the total exports of Kenya for 1928 were valued at  3,266,402, as against the figure for 1927 of  3,086,916, showing an increase of  180,000.   For Uganda the corresponding figures were, for 1928  3,395,000 and for&quot;T5&quot;27  2,310,000, showing a large increase of about a million pounds.    In these territories the main products exported were cotton, sisal and coffee.    The Uganda figures for cotton in 1927 were 526,000 and In 1928, 553,000 centals.&quot;^he Zanzibar  figures showed a slight decline in exports, chiefly in the export of cloves.   Copra, on the other hand, showed an increase of aboxit 20,000 cwts.  in a total trade of 300,000 cwts.    From Tanganyika the total imports for 1928 were  3,737,000, as against  3^,672,000 in 1927, an Increase of about  65,000.    The total domestic exports for 1928 were
COLONIAL    TRADE (CONTD.). 3,870,000 and for 1927  3,295,000:    giving an increase of over half a million pounds.    The percentage of trade from various countries was rather interesting.    Great Britain was represented by 36 per cent, in 1928 as compared with 38 per cent, in 1927, a slight decrease.    India had 12^ in 1928 as compared.with 13?b in 1927.    The British Empire total in 1928 was 54$ as compared with 58,4^ in 1927.      Germany, on the other hand, had gone up by Vyo,        12     per cent in 1928 and 11 per cent in 1927.    America was participating to the extent of 8?s in 1928, there being no comparable figure for 1927.    The main products exported were sisal, cotton, coffee,  ground nuts, hides and skins, grain,  gold, mica and diamonds.&apos;Nyasaland had not had so good a year as usual.    Domestic imports during December were valued at  73,000 as compared with  48,000 in November, and  93,000 in December 1927.    The year&apos;s imports reached a total value of  870,000 which was less than the preceding years by  68,000, or 7 per cent.    The trade of the protectorate might be said,  generally, to have been depressed during the whole of the year.    This depression, however, if the combined values of imports and exports were taken as an Indication, only denoted stagnation of trade when compared with the exceptional figures of 1926.The Cyprus statistics were interesting.    The total value of imports of merchandise during 1928 was  1,800,000, as against one and a half million for 1927, an increase of roughly a quarter of a million.    The chief countries from which imports were derived were the United Kingdom,, and other parts of the Empire, 44^; France 7%; Greece 6%;    Germany 6^, and Italy 5.8^. According to the Cyprus Trade Commissioner, in spite of the decrease in exports from Cyprus, those for the United Kingdom had increased from  278,000 in 1927 to  283,000 in 1928.SOUTH AMERICAN TRADE.During the first part of the current year, the economic and commercial situation in Argentina has continued satisfactory, and prospects appear bright, although in some areas the maize crop which is now being harvested has been damaged by lack of rain.    It is estimated that the quantity of maize likely to become available for export this season will not exceed 4 to 4-1 million tons.    The production of other cereals has been heavy. The volume of imports of British goods into Bahia Blanca continues to be far from gratifying, despite the large number of British ships that call there to take away the country&apos;s products It is,however, hoped that the proposed erection of new grain elevators, the contract for which has been secured by British firms, ,vill re3ult in the placing of substantial orders for British material.    An official announcement has been made by the Central Argentine Railway Company that it is about to undertake extensions and- improvements calling for expenditure for the equivalent of some  50,000,000.    This outlay&apos;will no doubt be spread over a period of years, and will result in the placing of substantial orders with British manufacturers.
Prospects in the Argentine import markets are at tho present time generally regarded with optimism.    The present situation is favourable to the British exporters already represented in the Argentine market, although there is no sign of any relaxation of the extremely keen competition between foreign suppliers of all kinds of merchandise -especially textiles, - while Argentina&apos;s native industries are producing goods required in the local markets In increasing measure, under protection of the import duties.In general, Chilean conditions are continuing the promising progress &quot;laadTe during 1928.   The agricultural situation is favourable, and many of the manufacturing industries aro maintaining a high level; of production, with the demand sufficient to prevent accumulation of heavy stocks. Pronounced activity is in evidence in new building construction, accompanied by a steady demand for agricultural implements and machinery, building materials and hardware, electrical materials, etc.    On the other hand, there is little enquiry.for textile manufactures, the trade in which is at present passing between seasons.    Some stringency has recently been experienced in the Chilean credit situation, but the official re-discount rates of the Central Bank remain unchanged.    It is reported that some measure of financial assistance will be forthcoming from the Government to producers in the nitrate of soda industry, after June next, when the present scheme ends, but it is not as yet known what form the new measures will take.A decree has been published reducing, as from 19th January, the import duties on sparkling wines by 25 per cent, This change has been instituted to facilitate trade between Chile and those wine-producing countries which offer markets for nitrate of soda.      Surveys are being made in the Magallanes (Punta Arenas) district In an endeavour to locate a suitable point to commence boring operations for petroleum, which experts apparently believe will eventually be discovered.    Under a recent Law, petroleum deposits found in the republic become the property of the State.Economic conditions in Uruguay throughout January were generally satisfactory, although the maize and fruit crops were adversely affected by drought.    Sales of summer goods were stimulated by hot weather, and the volume of trade in other lines was considered highly satisfactory.    Imports continued steady, and exports reached a maximum level, wool and meat especially being shipped in large quantities.^n Brazil distinctly more active conditions have been ruling in the internal coffee markets during the past few weeks, although Brazilian business conditions generally show no appreciableimprovement from the depressed situation existing during the last months of 1928.   Dealers in the Rio he Janeiro markets for imported goods report that there is an increasing demand for cement, reinforced concrete being required in large qaantities for the construction of many
important new buildings now in progress, while the relaying of roads with concrete foundations has also contributed to the shortage.   Stocks of tirrplate and general hardware also show signs of being definitely short of requirements.    In addition, it is possible that some demand may arise for railway construction materials for the Paulista Railway, which operates in the principal coffoe-producing State of Sao Paulo, and which proposes to increase its capital from 50,000 to 300,000 oontos (paper), to provide for electrification, extensions, and an increase of rolling stock.   For the most part, howevor, trade continues to be affeoted by the increased cost of living and the consequent advance in costs of production, which tendencies would no doubt be oheoked once the currency were legally established on a gold basis.A decree providing for new and increased duties on cotton goods was published In brazil on 10th January.    No speoific date was stipulated and the increased rates will presumably be brought into force 90 days after date of publication.    In consequence, Manchester firms for some weeks past have been In receipt of considerable orders for immediate shipment of manufactures calculated to arrive before the new Brazilian duties are applied, and it must remain to be seen to what extent the sudden influx of stqcks in this fashion will adversely afreet conditions in the   Brazilian markets.   To date, only slightly increased activity haB been observable in the native textile industries.In Peru, It Is reported that the building trades and farm labour are actively occupied, while the gradual Improvement in the economic situation of the Republic has created a feeling of optimism as to the future course of business, notwith-standing the existing dullness of trade during the planting season.During the past few days, yet another political revolt has taken place in the unfortunate history of Mexico, the centre of the disturbances having been the State of Vera Cruz.    No recovery In the commercial situation Is anticipated until after the constitutional Presidential elections are held in February, 1930, the present civilian President having been placed in office only provisionally.1&quot; Colombia an election of members to the Chamber of Deputies has taken place, the Government party being returned practically without opposition.    This augurs well for the maintenance of tranquil political conditions, and it is considered that the extensive programme of public works now in hand will bo proceeded with expeditiously.   European demand for Colombian coffees continues in evidence, and a partial reoovory has occurred in prices, in fact, indications are not lacking that the mild graces of coffee produced in the Central American countries are becoming increasingly popular with consumers, although thore can be no question that market conditions must continue to vary with those ruling for Brazilian coffee, which is largely controlled by the Brazilian Coffee Defence Committee.     Generally speaking, the tone in the Colombian commercial markets continues dull, although there seems to be a reasonable prospect of an improvemont in the early future.
Following the recent political disturbances in Guatemala, which fortunately lasted only a few days, business conditions in the Republic have resumed their normal course. A better demand has become apparent for Guatemalan coffee from both Europe and the United States, so that producers are now disposed to take a more favourable view of the out-look.The latest reports received from Ecuador state that there have lately been.indications of increased activity in the general commercial situation, and demands for credit are increasing.    Entries of cocoa from the producing centres, however, have been small, and prices in overseas markets remain low.    Business in the coffee market is also quiet. The railway to link the Republic with Guatemala is expected to be finished by April,  1929.
