I This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government, j Printed for the Cabinet.   April 1929.SECRET.^ q ^ qCP. 89 (29).CABINET.ANGLO-AMERICAN RELATIONSCompulsory Arbitration.Memorandum by the Lord President of the Council.I AM reluctant to trouble my colleagues with what is in substance a second part of my draft letter to Sir Robert Borden,* especially as I have not been able to attend the Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence of which I am nominally a member. If I do so now it is because, as it seems to me, the two English-speaking peoples are on the verge of seriously differing on points where they, of all parties to these international discussions, should find it easiest to agree. I refer to compulsory Arbitration and Belligerent Rights, t About the Kellogg Pact, which I hold to be a very important element in the situation, there is happily no difference of opinion.The Sub-Committee assume, if I am not mistaken, that compulsory arbitration is practically inevitable, and that if it be adopted it would be difficult, if not impossible, permanently to exclude the subject of Belligerent Rights from its operation. The Committee are unanimous in this conclusion, though all but one accept it with regret. The conclusion is, I admit, difficult to resist if the premise be accepted; but I would very earnestly suggest that there are reasons, good in themselves and of a kind which should appeal to American opinion, why the premise should be reconsidered.The advocates of the change are, I gather, under the impression that if they made arbitration compulsory they would simply be extending its use without altering its character. In these circumstances (they naturally ask), why we should hesitate to employ in all disputes a pacific procedure which has already proved its value in so many ? Whatever may be said against compulsory arbitration, it must, even at its worst, be better than war.   Why not give it a trial ?But those who thus argue have not based their theory of arbitration upon its practice. Had they done so they would surely have seen that no arbitral procedure can be made obligatory and universal without suffering profound modification. They have fixed their gaze, not upon any characteristic example of the whole process, but upon the dramatic and peaceful close of some successful case of its application. No spectacle could be more satisfying; and so long as men insist on quarrelling it cannot be too often repeated. But it never stands alone. It is the last stage of what is often a long and elaborate procedure, the final outcome of a great diplomatic effort.   Can we hope that the same results could be secured by compulsion ?Why not, say its advocates ? All that is wanted is a qualified tribunal; admitted principles of judgment; a clear issue; a definite verdict; and the will to carry it out. Are these things so very difficult of attainment ? There is no State with any pretensions to civilisation which would for a moment admit that in its own law courts it does not possess, and habitually use for domestic purposes, precisely the kind of machinery I have just described. There is no State that would hesitate to add that it found no difficulty in making the operation of this machinery compulsory. Why not do for the world at large what every State so easily and so effectively does for itself ?* See CP. 32 (29).t For Reports of Belligerent Rights Sub-Committee on the Renewal of Arbitration Treaties and Maritime Belligerent Rights see CP. 40 (29) and CP. 71 (29) respectively.[19027]
The answer, I should perhaps.say the first answer, is simple. A collection of States, bind them by what treaties you will, must always differ from a single State in the very matters most relevant to the efficient working of any scheme of compulsion. National law courts administer a code or system of laws narrowly limited in its scope, easily modified by national legislation, to suit changing circumstances, administered by experts elaborately trained to apply the law as they find it, debarred from extending or reforming it to meet hard cases, effectively checked by a system of appeals, supported in their decision by police and, if necessary, by soldiers. Translate into international terms these familiar national arrangements and compulsory arbitration between nations will, as I venture to think, begin to lose most of its attractions.These general considerations are strongly reinforced by the study of history, and, in particular, of Anglo-American history. Internationa] Arbitration, regarded as an appropriate and effective method of peaceably settling international disputes, is an Anglo-American invention. Almost everything we know about its practice is to be learned from arbitrations, or pro-procedures analogous to arbitration, between the United States and the British Empire, or from arbitrations between various South American republics due to the influence and example of the United States. What do they tell us about the pre-requisites of a great and successful international lawsuit the pre-requisites to which I have just referred? Has it always been so very easy (1) to find or create tribunals qualified to deal with particular cases; (2) to settle the principles on which the tribunal when found is to proceed; (3) to define with precision the issue on which it has to pronounce judgment; (4) to secure that its verdict when delivered shall be unambiguous; and (5) that, when delivered, it shall be acted upon without undue delay. None who know the facts will hazard an affirmative answer. These arrange-ments (expressed or implied) have hitherto been secured, in each particular case, between willing Governments, employing the flexible methods of diplomacy. How can they possibly be secured between reluctant Governments by the rigid provisions of a general treaty, which, because it professes to apply to all cases, is by no means certain to fit any case exactly. No doubt the reluctant Governments originally entered willingly into the treaty to which objection is now taken. But if circum-stances have changed, as they sometimes will, any Government may, without violating its engagements, begin to make difficulties. All the five conditions I have enumerated lend themselves easiby to alternative policies. Who under the proposed treaty is going to decide between them? Are they to be settled by a compulsory arbitration of the second degree-an arbitration not concerned with the merits of the dispute, but only with the fairest and wisest methods of bringing it to a decision 1These are obviously different problems; and it will hardly be suggested that the court which pronounces the final award should also pronounce on its own competence, draft the questions presented to it for judgment, decide what laws, national and international, it shall be its duty to administer, or what considerations of high expediency outside any formal law it shall consider itself justified in taking into account. But if such notions be rejected as absurd, would it be less absurd to fall back on what I have described as compulsory arbitration of the second degree piling up arbitration on arbitration, compulsion upon compulsion, in the vain search for an ideal system capable of universal application 1 I cannot think so. But as no such scheme, so far as I know, has yet been formulated, I need not press the matter further.My regret at the negative conclusion is mitigated by two considerations. The first is&apos; that the warmest advocates of compulsory arbitration shrink from making it universal. All nations at the moment of accepting the principle are permitted to arrange for its violation in certain cases. The United States, for example, have withdrawn the Monroe Doctrine. The British Government propose, I believe, to do the like with regard to Egypt and the Red Sea route to South Africa and the East. Here, then, we find the two nations who have done most for international arbitration so pleased with it that they contemplate making it compulsory, provided edivays that certain international relations in which they happen to be specially interested are excluded from its operation. The United States exclude relations with half the New World; the British Empire exclude certain regions commanding a great sea route to the East.Now I have no objection, I need hardly say, either to the Monroe Doctrine or to its oriental counterpart. I believe both arrangements to be in the interests, not only of the United States and of the British Empire, but of the world at large. But surely the attempt to fit or force these huge exceptions into a novel system of so-called compulsory arbitration will add little credit to international statesmanship.
346dIt will be gathered from what I have said that one of my objections to compulsory arbitration is the consequent discouragement of voluntary effort with its accompanying flexibility. It is therefore agreeable to reflect that one remarkable event in recent diplomatic history will have precisely the opposite effect. Under American leadership the world has welcomed the Kellogg Pact, and banned the use of war. But though this gTeat experiment, if it prove successful, will prevent fighting among civilised peoples, it is too much to hope that it will prevent quarrelling; and if they insist on quarrelling yet may not fight, how are they going to settle their difference? We need not trouble ourselves to anticipate the new devices which the diplomacy of the future may invent if necessity arises, or the old devices which they may borrow from the examples of the past; but some way out of the difficulty will certainly be found, and it will not be found in any system of rigid and compulsory arbitration.A. J. B.April 4, 1929.
