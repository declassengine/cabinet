IS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY lS GOVERNMENT). F,Un, COPY NO:CABINET,REPORT OF THE COMMISSION ON CLOSER UNION OF THE DEPENDENCIES IN EAST AFRICA.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for india a aMy colleagues will be considering at their next meeting the Report of the Commlssi on&apos; on the Closer Union of the Dependencies in Eastern and Central Africa (CP, 3  (29)) and also the Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies  (CP, 47  (29)) proposing, as a first step, to send out the Permanent Under Secretary of State for the purpose of local discussion of the recommendations contained in the Report.      The Secretary of State for the Colonies was good enough to let me see a proof of the latter d\;ring the week end.As my colleagues well know,  India has a great and direct interest in East African questions,  and already considerable interest has been shown in India in the present Report,      I must gratefully acknowledge the offer which the Governor of Kenya, with the approval of the Secretary of State for the Colonies,  made to appoint an officer of one of the Indian Civil Services to his Executive Council for the purpose of local discussions of the Commls si on&apos;s Report, and also the assurance given me by Mr. Amery himself that the
views of the Government of India in connection with the suggested change in the constitution of the Kenya Legislative Council should &quot;be awaited &quot;before any final recommendations are submitted to His Majesty &apos;s Government.My colleagues will realise that the matter in the Commission ^ Report on which Indian Interest is most acutely aroused is in regard to the suggested constitutional changes in Kenya,      The recommendations of three  of the members of the Commission are contained on pages 189 - 194: those of the Chairman on pages 247 - 249 of the Report. A comparison of these two passages will show that the two sets of recommendations diverge in an important respect. Both agree that the present official majority in the Council should be abolished; but whereas the recommendations of the majority leave the proportion of representatives as between Europeans and Indians, unchanged and also ensure that the Government representatives will be in a position to command the decision when the unofficial groups in the Council are divided on any question, the Chairman&apos;s recommendations would give the European groups a majority over the official group combined with the representatives of the other emigrant communities.This difference between the two sets of recommendations is so important from the point of view of the Indian community that I think it is very necessary to draw my colleagues 1 attention to It at the first possible moment.      It appears Inevitable that Sir Samuel Wilson&apos;s instructions  (if it is decided, as Mr. Amery proposes, to send him out to East Africa) must indicate which of these two recommendations he is authorised to put forward in the course of his visit to East Africa as the more likely to be
9 n ift O JiLapproved by His Ma jesty &apos;s Government.      This very nearly approaches to a decision - provisional no doubt, but in some degree a decision - on the point,, Moreover, if., as I understand, Sir Samuel Wilson is not only to discuss but. to negotiate, it is evident that he personally will be committed to the agreement at which he may have been able to arrive, and Mr. Amery&apos;s memorandum emphasises the influence which he will be able to exercise on his return to this country,     I must confess that though theoretically no &quot;final&quot; decision will have been taken at that stage, it appears to me that India will be confronted by something very like a fait accompll,P.India Office, S.W.1.25th February,  1929.
