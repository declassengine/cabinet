COPY NO:CABINET.NEW ANGLO-FRENCH SUBMARINE TELEPHONE CABLE AND&quot;CONNECTING LAND -CABLES. &quot; &apos;Joint Memorandum by l;he Treasury and the PostOffice.(Circulated by direction of the Chancellor of the Exchequer.)A new submarine cable will shortly be required to provide for growth of Anglo-French telephone traffic. Anglo-Continental cables are  jointly owned by the British and Foreign Governments;    and. the orders for new ones are placed alternatively by the British and Foreign Post Offices, the partner Office reimbursing the purchasing Office its half-share.      The last cable was ordered in 1926 by the British Post Office from a British firm, the French Post Office paying in accordance with e stablished practice half the cost.      It is now the turn of the French Post Office to. order the cable;    and they propose to place the order with a German firm and to pay for it by means of a reparations  credit.      The total cost of the cable is estimated at  38,000; of which about half represents the cost of the raw materials.There are no grounds upon which the right of the French Government to place the order for the whole cable,  and to place it In Germany, could be questioned,  so long as efficiency in manufacture Is secured at a satisfactory price. It Is very unlikely that any British firm would quote a price comparable with that which there is reason to think will be. qxxoted by German firms.G . P. 61 (291-
The cable between the terminal Repeater Stations at Boulogne and at Canterbury,  comprising the submarine section and connecting land sections at each end is to all intents and purposes a single cable, which mast be of exactly the same elctrical characteristics throughout and must therefore be manufactured by the same contractor. There is accordingly no practicable alternative to including the land section between Canterbury and the&apos;coast (estimated value  21,000) in the order to be placed by the French Government,      British labour would be employed to draw in the cable between     Canterbury and the coast0 In the case of the last cable,  the French land section was ordered from the British firm which supplied the submarine section.The British Post Office proposes to accept responsibility for its share of the cost of this cable and to ask the French Post Office to proceed with the order.The expenditure to be borne by Great Britain (apart from the cost of laying and subsidiary apparatus) will thus   be Half share of submarine cable 19,000 Land Cable 21,00040,000It is proposed that the British share of the expenditure should, like the French share, be met out of reparations, i.e. that the contractor shall be paid in German currency out of the Eritish credit with the Agent General for Reparation Payments.      The general policy of this country has beei)io decline to take deliveries
9 0.0W *J tjIn kind (-;ith the exception of certain dyestuffs and timber taken before the Dawes Plan).      We have hitherto succeeded in drawing the whole of the British Empire share of reparation, mostly through the operation of the Reparation Recovery Act procedure;   but the reparation annuity increases considerably this year and so long as the Transfer Protection under the Dawes Plan (or any similar arrangement) is in force, we cannot rely with Certainty on being able to draw the whole of our share in future by the existing methods.      If therefore, we can utilise  40,000 as a means of payment for this cable, it will facilitate the transfer of our share.      The case Is entirely exceptional since, for the reasons explained above, there appears to be no alternative to obtaining the cable from Germany, and if it is not paid for on reparation account, the payment to the German contractor will have to be made in sterling in the usual way. Thus the proposal to take our share of the cable as a reparation delivery will be of definite financial  advantage, but will not give any just ground for complaint to the British contractors.Treasury Chambers, S.F.I.25th February,  1929.
