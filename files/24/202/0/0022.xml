[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]&apos;2   UW&apos;TURKEY,. February 28, 1929.CONFIDENTIAL?^-^- Section 1.[E 1090/189/44] No. 1.Sir G. Clerk to Sir Austen Chamberlain. (Received February 28.) (No. 88.)Sir, Constantinople, February 21, 1929.WITH reference to my despatch No. 57 of the 8th instant relative to the supplying of destroyers and submarines to the Turkish Government, I gather that such soundings as at least one interested British firm has taken as to the possibility of support by British banks disclose considerable reluctance on the part of the latter to guarantee the undertaking.2. This&apos; attitude is natural enough, but it probably means the loss of the order to British industry.3. It is, of course, early days to expect the banks to give any definite assurances, for British firms have still to secure the offer of the contract against their foreign rivals. But if our people succeed so far as that, they will then have to make an effort to get the support of the British banks, who in their turn may be expected to try to ascertain the views of His Majesty&apos;s Government as to the credit of Turkey and to commit us to an indirect blessing on the enterprise.4. It may therefore be worth while to set forth the position briefly as I see it here.5. Both politically and economically it is much to be hoped that British firms will get the order. Politically, because it will draw our relations to Turkey closer, economically because it will benefit British labour. The question thus boils down to the nature of the financial risk involved.6. Since payments will be made over a period of anything from six to ten years, the first consideration is the stability of the present regime. No one would care to prophesy as to that, for anything may happen in Turkey, but it is a general risk which, if it stood alone, should in my opinion unhesitatingly be taken. What really matters is the good faith and capacity to pay of the present Turkish Government. The various vessels are to be completed and delivered within two years, and during that time the Turkish Treasury bills will be punctually met. It is less safe to count on equal punctuality once the ships are safe in Turkish waters. Not that I anticipate any deliberate intention of the Turkish Government to fail to meet these obligations, but because of the possible emptiness of the exchequer. Many competent observers here think that the limit of taxation has been reached, and that the revenue, which has just been saddled with the payment of the coupons for the Ottoman debt, and of the sums necessary for the purchase of the Anatolian Railway, to which may possibly be added the repayment of the Constantinople Municipal Loan, cannot stand the further charges required to pay for these ships. This may be very nearly true, but three things lead me to think that Turkey both could, and would, pay. Firstly, the same cry that the year&apos;s expenditure will show a heavy deficit has been raised during the last three years, but during that time the estimates, both of revenue and expenditure, have steadily gone up and no deficits have shown themselves. Secondly, the amount of the order is about  2^ million sterling, which, for ten years, represents roughly  T. 2\ million per annum, an amount which, in my opinion, the Turkish revenue could stand. Lastly, and most important of all, default in this respect would be so deadly a blow to Turkish credit that I think that the Government would make every effort to meet its obligations.7. Should, therefore, British banks make enquiries of His. Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment, I venture to suggest that we should, while disclaiming anything like exerting pressure or incurring any responsibility for the decision of the banks, let them know, confidentially, the position as I see it here.I have, &amp;c.GEORGE R, CLERK.[726 ee-1]
