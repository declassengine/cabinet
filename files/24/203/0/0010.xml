I This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.] Printed for the Cabinet.   April 1929.SECRET. &apos; Copy No.   28CP. 110 (29).CABINET.COLONIAL DEVELOPMENT IN RELATION TO THE PROBLEM OFUNEMPLOYMENT.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.SINCE the Memoranda circulated by the Home Secretary (CP. 27 (39)), the Minister of Labour (CP. 37 (29)), and the Chancellor of the Exchequer (CP. 53 (29)) on various aspects of the unemployment problem, all refer to the possibility of promoting Colonial development with a view to expanding the markets of this country and ultimately increasing the amount of employment here, I think it may be well if I furnish the Committee with a general statement which will indicate my views in the matter.In my memorandum of the 18th March, entitled &quot;An Employment Policy for the Election,&quot; which has been circulated as CP. 87 (29), I recommended the creation of a Colonial Development Fund as part of a permanent policy of Empire development, based not on loans or guarantees, but on fixed allocations to a body definitely entrusted with the financial responsibility for giving effect to the policy. I will revert to this proposal in the course of the present memorandum.The records of the efforts which the Government has made during the last few-years to make use of Colonial development as a means of promoting the relief of unemployment in this country show little result but correspondence, committees and delay. It is probably not realised to what extent the Colonies, Protectorates and other Dependencies actually provide employment in this country in the ordinary course of business. It is estimated that the Crown Agents for the Colonies have bought over 33 million pounds&apos; worth of stores in this country during the last five years and over 8 million pounds&apos; worth in 1927 all out of Colonial funds. These figures admittedly show a very substantial contribution to the problem. During the same five years four Colonies raised over  18,000,000 by way of development loans, and of this amount some  7,000,000 at least have gone in buying goods here. Over and above that sum of  7,000,000, which comes directly and immediately back, a further considerable part of the  18,000,000 has been spent in the salaries of Europeans, a large proportion of which is spent in the United Kingdom, while the remainder goes to swell the purchasing power of the natives. In a country like Nigeria, for example, where about 70 per cent, of the imports are from the United Kingdom, a considerable proportion, again, of the money spent out of a development loan must find its way back to the United Kingdom. That this expenditure also has indirectly developed new valuable markets is clearly borne out by the steady expansion of British export trade to countries like Nigeria.I cannot help feeling that we have proceeded on the wrong lines in our recent attempts at speeding up development by way of a partnership enterprise. We have asked too much of the Colonies, and have offered too little ourselves for what is, after all, our problem, and unless we change these lines we shall continue to arrive at the same negative results when the Colonies are asked to do more than they are already doing.Further, each time the Colonial Office has been asked to produce material in connection with the unemployment problem it has been treated as if it were an exceptional emergency or crisis to be dealt with by special measures taken in a hurry. On the one hand, we have been asked to produce proposals for putting in hand large Public Works (which obviously call for a great deal of surveying and preliminary work) to enable the Home Government to deal with the problem of [19123]
distress in the coming winter. On the other hand, we have been offered terms which have never seemed to us to have been sufficient to induce Colonial Governments to make additional efforts, the effect of which would be appreciable. I am convinced that it is of no use looking for such help if the British Government are going to ask the Colonies to accept liabilities in the shape of debt charges for enterprises which are not ripe for execution, because it is obvious that, if the construction of a railway or a bridge will be an immediate remunerative undertaking, any solvent Colony is only too anxious to build it without pressure from this end. I think, therefore, that, if the Imperial Government wishes to come to business, it must offer, on loans raised in approved cases for development, payment of the whole interest (say) for a period of five years, and possibly half or three-quarters interest for a longer period until the revenue from the development accrues to the Colony. Further, if a real long-range policy is to be framed, it must be realised at the outset that the question is not one of how to deal with a temporary emergency or even with crises which recur inter-mittently. The trade depression and unemployment in the heavy industries in this country must be regarded as an economic factor of some permanence, and must be tackled by a continuous policy and not by spasmodic efforts on short notice from time to time.I therefore suggest as a possible solution of the problem that a certain sum of money should be placed at the disposal of the Secretary of State for the Colonies as a Colonial Development Fund for a series of years, which would be used to meet the interest charges in whole or in part on schemes of development in Colonies and Protectorates undertaken with the definite view of providing markets for the home manufacturer and employment for home labour. The provision of the money which I suggest would show the Colonial Governments that His Majesty&apos;s Government recognise the fact that the Colonies and Protectorates are being asked to do some-thing for us. On the other hand, it would mean expending a known annual figure, which is preferable to incurring the indeterminate liabilities involved in a guarantee. I hope that the Committee will give this idea their sympathetic consideration, as I feel that on examination it will be found that in its direct effect the scheme will be cheaper than the old ones, leaving out of account altogether its indirect effect in helping engineering firms to take on other contracts.The arrangements which I suggest would apply only to such works as the Secretary of State could sanction as being undertaken in anticipation of the ordinary programme on definite grounds of public policy, viz., the creation of a present demand for British industrial produce, and not to works which would, in any case, have been undertaken at once or at an early date in the ordinary way. In particular, I think that most, if not all, of the works which are hereafter approved for construction in East Africa under the Palestine and East Africa Guaranteed Loans Act would be included in the scope of this proposal, and I am confident that the assistance thus given would turn the scale in the direction of making many services practicable. I think, indeed, that it would be justifiable to apply my suggestion to works under that Act which have already been authorised, and so set free revenue which would enable the Governments concerned to take in hand sufficient under -takings beneficial to employment at home.It will be remembered that the whole basis of the recommendations of the East Africa Commission of 1925,* that the total figure should be  10,000,000, was estimated on the assumption that interest for the first five years would be found by His Majesty&apos;s Government. The rejection of this basis has made it impossible to proceed with any long-range development projects under this Act. Less than  3,500,000 of the  10,000,000 has been spent in three years.It would be difficult to produce figures in connection with the proposal which I have made until the Colonial Governments are consulted and a programme of works to be gradually brought under the scheme drawn up; but the amount which I consider might well be allocated to the Colonial Development Fund should ultimately be at least  1,000,000 annually, in which, however, might be included the  250,000 a year now spent by the Treasury in grants-in-aid to backward Colonies and Protectorates. Here again, however, only a relatively small amount could be usefully spent in the first year, say,  200,000 new money (making, with the grants-in-aid, a total for 1929-30 of  450,000). The bulk of this ultimate annual grant of  1,000,000 would be expended, on the advice of a Committee or Board, comprising commercial and technical members, under the Secretary of State for the Colonies, in the payment of whole or part of the interest for a certain number of years on loans for railways and&quot; (Jmd. 2387.
other public works in the Colonial Empire in order to expedite their construction or promote other schemes of general development.Given a free hand in applying this sum to useful works, I believe that I could undertake to ensure such development, particularly in Africa, as would give a real impetus to -heavy industry at home, and create a permanently increased trade purchasing-power in Africa as a growing market for all varieties of manufactured goods. ,A schedule is attached showing schemes recommended by the East Africa Guaranteed Loan Committee and sanctioned by the Treasury.There are two points in the note prepared in the Treasury enclosed in the Chancellor of the Exchequers Memorandum of the 25th February (CP. 53 (29)) which call for some comment. As regards the statements in paragraph 11 concerning the financing of Public Works under the East Africa Guaranteed Loans Act, it should be remembered that, as the East Africa Loan gave nothing in the way of interest during the period of construction, there was no incentive to Colonial Governments to consider schemes for development railways, i.e., railways which would, not become immediately remunerative, but would gradually open up undeveloped territory and create new purchasing power and commerce. , Such works impose an immediate charge on the Colony without an immediate return. They create an immediate demand in this country for which interest on the loan in its early years would not be too high a price to pay.In the following paragraph 12 I dissent strongly from the conclusions arrived at, and, in particular, from the words in parentheses, &quot; thus further turning the exchanges against us.&quot; I take the argument to be that we give credits here which are not reflected in purchases made here. In my view it is not the question of obtaining immediate orders for material that is the most important because it is not a short-lived crisis with which we are dealing but the increase of complementary trade between the raw material-producing countries and an industrial country like ours and this in areas where, in spite of the absence of Imperial Preference, there is, in fact, a tremendous voluntary preference for British over foreign manufactured exports. The Colonies and Protectorates are new countries with growing markets, and anything which hastens or enlarges their economic expansion redounds permanently to the benefit of the industries of Great Britain.I am reluctant to accept the Treasury argument that &quot; private enterprise is more likely than the Government to direct investment to purposes which are economically justified,&quot; and that, therefore, we live in the best of all possible worlds, in which unemployment is a blessing in disguise. It is clearly the duty of the Government to use all means in its power to direct the monies available for investment into channels where they will create a demand for British goods and employment for British labour, and it is to the opportunities which the Empire affords of fulfilling that duty that I am drawing attention.L.
