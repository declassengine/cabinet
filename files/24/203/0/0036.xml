[This Dooamant is the Property of Hie Britannic majesty&apos;8 Governmant. j268Printed for the Cabinet.   May 1929.SECRET.Copy No.     28CP. 136 (29).CABINET.REPARATIONS AND INTER-ALLIED DEBTS.Committee of Experts.I CIRCULATE, for the information of my colleagues, a long statement which I have received from Sir Josiah Stamp, detailing the problems which the British Delegation were confronted with in regard to arrears under the Balfour Note, and the position of the Dominions, and the line which they pursued. I preface this by a brief statement of what I understand to be the present position in the Conference.Since Sir J. Stamp&apos;s report was written there have been a number of further developments in the negotiations. It is understood that the Chairman has prepared a revised proposal based on an average annuity of  100 millions for thirty-seven years, followed by annuities covering war debts alone for twenty-two years. The annuity would start at a figure considerably below  100 millions and rise above it after the first ten years or so. This proposal has been accepted as a basis of discussion both by the German and the Allied Delegations, and there seems a reasonable prospect that it will enable an agreement to be arrived at.If a settlement is reached, the Report of the Committee is likely to be in two parts: (a) A report signed by all the Delegations recommending the fixation of the German debt on the basis of the annuity agreed upon; and (&amp;) a short report signed by the Allied representatives alone, dealing with the distribution of the annuity.It is understood that this second Report is likely to suggest the distribution of the annuity in proportions similar to, though not identical with, the existing arrangements, subject to the following points : (a.) No provision would be made for claims in respect of Army of Occupation costs, whether past, or future. The abandonment of past claims would entail a minor sacrifice by France and Great Britain, but a larger sacrifice by the United States. Future Army costs would automatically cease with the evacuation of the Rhineland.(b.) The other Delegations may try to secure the renunciation by the British Delegation of a substantial part of the share of reparations due to the British Dominions.  This point is dealt with below.Apart from this last proposal, it appears that we should be covered (year by year) for our future debt payments to America. This is an important advantage during the earlier years, when the German payments will be less than  100 millions and the Spa percentages might leave us a deficiency.   As explained in detail in w. S. C.Treasury Chambers, Whitehall, S.W., May 8, 1929.Note by the Treasury on the Present Position.[19237]B
Sir J. C. Stamp&apos;s statement which follows, the British representatives agreed, at a time when discussion was concentrated on a substantially larger annuity which the Germans rejected, that our claim for arrears under the Balfour Note should be converted into an additional share of the capital in the proposed International Bank. On the annuity now being considered the Spa percentage for Great Britain would provide only a small sum for arrears in any event, and it is understood to be Sir Josiah&apos;s view that the additional capital in the International Bank will provide an adequate compensation for forgoing that sum in cash.On the other hand, it appears that the other Delegations may, in the end, make their acceptance of the reduced annuity now proposed conditional upon our agreeing that the receipts in respect of our debt to America should be regarded as satisfying the full reparation claims of the British Empire, i.e., no share of reparations would be provided for the Dominions. This proposal is based on a mistaken and unjustifiable interpretation of the Balfour Note, which, of course, related only to the share of reparations of the United Kingdom and not to those of the Dominions. It would, in fact, be necessary for the British Government to make good to the Dominions the short-fall in their reparations which would result from this proposal (about  2^ millions a year), and thus we should not only have to forgo our arrears under the Balfour Note in the form of cash, but we should get less than is necessary to cover our future debt payments to America. A few days ago it appeared probable that the other Delegations would form a united front against us on this point; but since then the position has improved and it may be hoped that finally agreement may be reached on a basis which will not entail any reduction in the Dominions&apos; shave. If however, any proposal for such a reduction of the Dominions&apos; share should be embodied in the Report by the other Delegations, it is understood that the British Delegation will enter a definite reservation to the Report starting from the formal o-round of the Spa percentage which represents the contractual right of the British Empire. The question will then have to be taken up and dealt with in the eventual International Conference.Since the above was written a letter (dated the 7th Ala)&apos;) has been received from Sir J. C. Stamp, showing that matters have gone back to the position in which they stood a few days ago, i.e., it is likely to be proposed that we should not only give up all arrears, but also the entire share of the Dominions and Colonies. A further development is the disappearance of the proposal that the United States should make- a substantial sacrifice in respect of their Army cost arrears. Italy will be the chief gainer in the percentage distribution. If the Committee reaches decisions in this sense the British Delegation will enter a strong reservation against the proposed distribution.We understand that the alterations in the annual receipts of each of the Powers under the Experts&apos; proposals, as compared -with the receipts which the new annuity should give them under the existing arrangements (based on the Spa percentages), will be as follows : Distribution of an annuity of 1,988 million gold marks.

Before dealing with the course of events, and the present position, a few points of fact are set out, as reminders and to give ready definition :  (a.) British &quot;arrears,&quot; commonly so called, on the Balfour Note are  200 million. It would take a total annuity of 2-9 milliards for 58 years to clear this off on the existing British percentage. Even 2-5, the Dawes standard, would only recover  125 million, spread over fifty-eight years.2-3 would recover  86 million. 2-1 would recover  47 million. 2-0 would recover  28 million. 1-9, arrears practically disappear.(&amp;.) If the flat annuities above are made up of a progressive scale, starting, say, at 1-7 or 1-8 milliard, we get current deficits at first, which are later made good; but the realisation of the above recoveries lies in the fairly distant future.   The recovery of arrears is of no immediate importance.(c.) There is no discernible case for claiming an increase of the British percentage at the expense of the other Creditors. The Balfour Note implications are rather in the opposite direction, and this view is readily adopted by them.(d.) As Experts, especially after ten weeks&apos; study, we regard the fixation of the German annuity without transfer protection as involving, for the safety of the payments, figures considerably lower than 2-5 milliards. We should feel most relieved if we could fix it, without breaking the creditor front, at 2 milliards at the outside; or, if the average flat figure is higher, on a progressive scale starting much lower. In the first case, the British percentage gives a very small contribution to the recovery of arrears. In the second, what recoveries there are lie well into the future.(e.) In the above circumstances, figures like  200 and  125 million as expressive of &quot;arrears&quot; have no practical meaning for us. The automatic reduction as the annuity comes down is not regarded as a &quot; concession,&quot; or as &quot; giving &quot; anything up. When we talk of arrears and giving them up, we are speaking of the small margin between future Debt cover and Spa percentages, of the order of  2 million per annum.This has had to be weighed in the balance against many other considerations, as the following notes will indicate.2. During the earlier weeks of the proceedings, when references were made in private conversations to British requirements under the Balfour Note, they nearly always related to the future and ignored our claim to arrears. We always replied formally that the Balfour Note applied as from the beginning, 1922, and that, as stated in the Note circulated by His Majesty&apos;s Government to the other Governments concerned last October, our arrears would only be dealt with in relation to the claims of other Governments to receive payments in excess of their Debt liabilities. But it soon became evident that no one seriously believed that we should maintain this attitude; the French Experts based their view on inferences drawn from the conver-sation between the Chancellor of the Exchequer and M. Poincare in October last; the Italians on conversations at the Treasury; and the Chairman assumed from the start that, in estimating Great Britain&apos;s minimum requirements, the arrears could be ignored, for on any reasonable annuity they were indeed negligible.[19237] n 2
&apos; The Dominions&apos; claim on Spa percentages was hardly mentioned at this stage and certainly not called into question. But when the Chairman came into the open&apos; with proposals, he was at first disposed to ignore this claim also and treat it as merged with Balfour Note. But he deferred to us when we told him privately that we should maintain it, and appreciated that it must either be regarded as an outgoing under the Balfour Note, or a separate claim for non-differential treatment similar to that of a minor creditor.3. When discussions on Allied requirements were imminent, some French and Italian proposals showed that the prevalent idea was that any surplus of the British Spa share over future Debt cover (i.e.. what we call arrears) could be divided up at their own sweet will. So we circulated a letter to the other Experts in which we stated the principles we adopted in regard to these arrears (varying with the amount of the Annuity), viz., that we should first examine our share, on the Spa percentages, of any annuity proposed; and that if this share gave any surplus over our future net debt outgoings, we held that this surplus must be used, in order of merit (i) to contribute to our past arrears; (ii) to permit some abatement from the total German Annuity in the interest of safety; and (iii) only in the last place to increase the share of any other Power, with preference to any Power whose debt outgoings, reckoned from the start, would not otherwise be covered, i.e., who did not get Brdfour Note conditions themselves. We added that, before considering any encroachment on her future surplus, Great Britain must be fully satisfied that the demands of other countries were justified, and that the total annuity was not too large for safety. Afterwards, when a progressive scale from a low level was intro-duced, and we were left with current deficiencies on debt payments, made up by later surpluses and a net surplus accruing only in the distant future to set against our past deficit, we introduced a new principle, viz., that such surplus was due to us as an insurance against the long period taken to give us bare future debt cover.4. The situation at this time was as follows : There had been a tremendous struggle in tactics as to how figures should be got on the table. For good reasons at the time the Chairman resisted both a very low German offer (say, 1 milliard) and a high creditor demand (say, 2-5) as both calculated to break up the Conference. He wanted nothing but figures approaching the debatable area say, 1-9 to 2-2 milliards, Eventually it was solved by bringing on to the table two memoranda presented on the 28th March. The first represented the Chairmairs suggestions, expressed in general terms, regarding the minimum requirements of the Allies; the second (an unsatisfactory document in which we concurred only because the first memorandum was presented concurrently) represented rather the French point of view, and invited discussion of the extent to which the present standard annuity of 2-5 milliard gold marks could be lowered by the reduction of the shares of the Creditor Powers individually. Dr. Schacht had discussed this last method of approach separately with the French, Italian, Belgian and British experts, with the ridiculous result that the total reached nearly 3 milliards, and by an error in tactics each was kept in ignorance of the fact until Dr. Schacht was allowed to announce it to them, when he retired to leave them to get out of a humiliating situation as best they could. Then followed a week of strenuous fighting between the creditors, with the&apos; Germans kept waiting day after day, literally &quot; put off&quot; from hour to hour. They waited in sardonic humour and with politely veiled mockery, and refer to &quot;the week when the weather was so bad we couldn&apos;t&apos;t leave the hotel.&quot; It was a very unhappy preparation of their mentality for the situation when we came to grips. During the critical week there was the imminent risk of the Conference breaking (or of a delay interpreted as a breach), not with the Germans at all. but through one or other of the Allies, each manoeuvring to put the onus on the other The experts of these four Allied countries thus decided to meet under the chairman-ship of Mr. Owen Young in order to agree among themselves on some figure which could reasonably be put forward for discussion with Dr. Schacht and would at the same time cover the minimum demands of their Governments and leave room for those of the minor Creditor Powers .5. The first method of approach having failed, the Chairman&apos;s memorandum of the 28th March inevitably became the basis of discussion at these meetings, and he undertook to put his proposals into figures. . iIn spite of our reservations, the Chairman had persisted in-allowing Great Britain nothing for arrears, but he had given us to understand that he proposed to
include the amount due to the Dominions.: . Indeed, on the evening before he(presented his figures, he asked us what that amount was, and we told him that, it was approximately 56 million gold marks per annum on the average. But his staff and calculators had been responsible for building up the total,, and fwhen at last his figures were tabled and analysed by us, we found the amount actually ^provided for tjae Dominions was only 21-6 million gold marks -although the Chairman was under the impression we had been fully met.   (Nothing was allowed for British &quot; arrears.&quot;)At the same time, the Chairman had apparently admitted to some extent Belgian and Italian demands having no foundation in the Treaty or in inter-Allied Agreements, i.e., a Belgian demand on account of the mark currency left by the Germans in Belgium at the Armistice and redeemed by the Belgian Government at par, and an Italian demand for an increase in her Spa percentage sufficient to give her an appreciable surplus over her debt outgoings. (The Italian position for Signor Pirelli was acute. Private pressure by the first British Delegate upon the Fascist members to induce Pirelli to be less insistent because of the risk of bringing about a break, achieved the result that they took alarm at their own policy and exerted less pressure on him so that he became more like himself and relatively reasonable.)The Chairman&apos;s calculations led to an annuity averaging 2,105 millions for 37 years, and thereafter equal to debt outgoings.We are satisfied that the Chairman had no intention of holding the scales unevenly. Indeed, at a slightly later stage he acquiesced in an abatement in the American share of the Annuity, which could be represented as reducing that American share by 75 per cent., and which we believe has given rise to a storm of protest from Washington. But the hiatus between his views or theories on the facts and merits of almost every question relating to inter-Allied distribution and those of his calculators resulted in our being placed in an entirely false position in having to contend for a basis which need never have been put in doubt. In his subsequent conduct of the proceedings the Chairman could do little to remedv this.6.   In the four days&apos; heated discussion which folknved, we of course claimed (a) a future surplus over debt outgoings, to cover British arrears pro tanto; and(b) the full share of the Dominions.We demonstrated that, under the Chairman&apos;s suggestions, while the present Standard Annuity was reduced as a whole by 16 per cent., the Italian and Belgian receipts Avould be practically unaltered, the French would be reduced by 15 per cent., the British by 24 per cent.; and as the Dominions fell by 68 per cent., it was a proof of the inadvertence of the computation.When the Chairman had admitted certain changes in the figures consequent on several claims for a correct interpretation of the principles of his note the total became 2,345 million g.m., at which point we had claimed as consequential an annual surplus of 50 million g.m., to go towards our arrears. This total was regarded by him as impossible to present, and he begged us to get down below 2,200, say 2,198. The cutting down process was painful and gradual. We offered to reduce our arrears claim pari passu with the total, down to 2 milliards, but we maintained the Dominions proportion throughout. (The calculations were constantly shifting according to the changes in the prior charges, before applying percentages.)Our endeavours were met with every possible fprm of counter-attack by the French and Belgians in concert, the Italian Expert sometimes attacking or aiding either side as occasion offered. The other Experts argued that they knew nothing of the Dominion claims, and their Governments had not been consulted thereon; or that their Governments had not accepted the Balfour Note. They pretended to assume, on the faith of the Chairman&apos;s figure, that 21-6 million g.m. was the proper figure for the Dominions, and that in seeking to increase the Dominion portion to 56 million g.m., we were asking for a surplus. It is perhaps idle to summarise all the arguments for and against. The vital point is that the Chairman ultimately concluded that, on the logical rendering of his own principles for constructing his annuity, he could only get Spa percentage of the excess of the annuity over debt outgoings as recognition for the Dominions. He apparently assumed that they would receive their debt outgoings (i.e., their Debts to the U.K., a larger figure), but this would then be British incomings for the Balfour Note.At the end of three days of joint discussion, during which the average annuity for the first 37 years had been raised from 2,105 to 2,345 and then reduced to
2,198 million g.in., France and Italy had given up part of their claims to us, but still left us 8 millions short on the Dominions&apos; share and gave us nothing fox- arrears on which by that stage we were claiming 18 9 million g.m. A further private discussion with the French Experts was completely abortive. After we had assured the Chairman that this definitely meant a break, and regardless of his logic he must recognise a fact, he privately induced the French and Italian Experts to give up enough to cover the Dominions&apos; share on condition that we abandoned any claim in respect of the 18-9 million g.m. for our arrears.7. An outright refusal to accept this proposal would have led to the complete breakdown of the Committee&apos;s work in circumstances which would have reflected great discredit on the Allied Members. The Germans were to meet the next day and, telegraphic reference home being of no value, a visit to London would have been necessary. The delay was agreed by the Chairman, and us all, to be interpretable, in the then atmosphere, as a British break on 18-9 million for arrears. We had been sufficiently in touch with the Chancellor of the Exchequer to know that he did not desire that any British intransigeance should cause a breakdown; and it was thus that any breakdown at this point would have been represented, with the possibility of dangerous political consequences.Moreover, we always saw that the scheme had certain merits from the British point of view. For example, it comprised an arrangement by which cover for debt outgoings is provided year by year, while with the Spa percentages Great Britain would start by incurring a further deficit which would only be made good and converted into a surplus later on.The following considerations also applied : (a.) Inasmuch as we felt that a settlement would most likely never be effected at so high an average figure as 2,198, and since at a lower figure arrears were negligible, we were breaking for an ultimate unreality.(b.) Again, the general atmosphere surrounding the question of arrears made a break on this particular question particularly obnoxious it was our weakest ground. It was far more vulnerable than justice to the Dominions.(c.) We were able to propose recognition of the claim for arrears in a substantial and important alternative form which was accepted.   (See   8.)There was therefore no doubt in our minds that, in British interests, we ought to accept the last proposal made. (We remember that Lord Revelstoke in particular was very disturbed at the growing difficulty between the Allies, and rejoiced at the completely new atmosphere that was immediately created by what he regarded as a negligible sacrifice). In doing so we secured a stipulation that the claim in respect of Balfour Note arrears which we had given up should, as far as possible, be made good in the distribution of the capital of the proposed Bank for Inter-national Settlements, towards which we contemplate that Germany should provide certain annuities, over and above the annuities referred to above, payable in marks which would not for the present be transferable out of Germany.8. The present position is, therefore, if the annuity stays at 2,198 flat the Dominions get their full share, but there is no recognition of arrears. But it was then and still is proposed that, in addition to this main annuity, Germany shall make a contribution of Mark annuities for some 10 years to the capital of the Bank, which shall belong to her and the Creditor Governments in proportions to be determined. We are to have a special priority in the ownership in recognition ot our claim given up on the main annuity. We are engaged in formulating the way in which this shall be recognised in the Capitalisation. Certain advantages appear : (a) The capital values it creates belong to us much earlier than the share of the main annuity would do; ib) allocation of bank capital by such proportions as Spa percentages tends to make the Bank too exclusively French, and this will establish practical equality.9. If the figure of 2,198&apos;should emerge (because of non-agreement with Germany) as the majority proposal and if the scheme for Bank capital does not survive therein, we regard ourselves as at liberty to repudiate the repartition agreement above without mala fides.
Whether we ought to do so, as a matter of expediency, is a matter for some hesitation.10. We must add that if we might feel disposed to criticise the Chairman&apos;s position in these Inter-allied discussions, his handling of the discussions between the German Experts and the others has been in every way admirable. The situation on the Committee has been such that the prospect of a final settlement has all along depended,-&quot;first, on the Chairman&apos;s influence over the German Experts, on the one hand, and the Experts of the Latin countries on the other; and secondly, on the amount of support he could rely on from the British Experts. It was necessary for us, at all costs to avoid weakening the Chairman&apos;s hands, as we should have done if, by too rigid an insistence on the Spa percentages, we had entirely repudiated the bargaining ideas which he contributed to the Inter-allied discussions. It is our considered view that a final settlement with Germany would be impossible without some modification of these percentages.It represented a rather remarkable deviation from Washington views about identity between Debt and Reparations that the Chairman&apos;s own approach to the building up of an annuity should be to take first (a) the actual outgoings as an irreducible basis, adding to them (6) the reparation claims of each country squeezed to a minimum.To pivot the latter (and, therefore, the total annuity) upon France, and build the total of (b) by taking France&apos;s share as 54/100ths, was a position into which they were subsequently forced. It left him with the task of fitting everyone else into the remaining 46/100ths.It presented two troubles first, too high a total annuity, and second, the task of fitting everyone else into the remaining 46/100ths.Ambiguities about the meaning of net outgoings for debts&quot; led to miscalculations, and many struggles to get the Chairman&apos;s interpretation of his own meaning favourable to each party.It would have been a simple matter to have said &quot; A low annuity and Spa percentages strictly adhered to &quot; but it would inevitably have smashed the conference at any stage. Moreover, it was not a proper attitude for Experts to take up, in advance of enquiry. The utmost the situation justified was : &quot; We do not mind building up annuities by processes departing from Spa. We shall test the final results by Spa; if there are serious deviations, there will -be serious troubles.&quot; It must be remembered that, at a 2,000 million gold mark total annuity, our net Debt outgoings are very close to our own Spa percentages (allowing for the Dominions), and is we were out for a reasonable figure, the Spa percentage point to us, so long as outgoings were covered, tended to represent a minor point on which a &quot; break &quot; would have been inconceivable for independent Experts.We therefore became inevitably embarked with the others on this exploration, which, indeed, had various attractions for us, and only the misunderstanding by the Chairman of the effect of his principle on the Dominions precipitated a crisis for the British Delegation, which had to arrive at a decision in a few minutes, or break the whole proceedings. (It is a strange comment that all the Experts have a very free hand in settling the total annuity, but all seem to be tied to the point of embarrassment upon relative division or the actual sum to be received by their own country.)11. The immediate situation is that under great pressure the Germans are seeking to reduce the 2,198 flat to something like 2,050, by paring off each of the Creditor claims individually. There may be a renewed attack upon the Dominion percentage this time from Schacht.We propose, if the annuity is altered from 2,198 gold marks  (a.) to keep that free hand which alone is consistent with our position here as independent Experts in immediately dealing with the small margin of our Spa share over Debt outgoings, taking the risk of the Government repudiating our action afterwards if they so desire; and(b) to refuse to accept any material difference between the percentage reductionof the Dominions share of the Annuity and the reduction of the whole Airhuity.If the other Experts purport to reach any agreement less favourable to us, we should agree to the total annuity, but make our reservation disapproving the
repartition arrangements. The actual ground would be that, though we have not enquired what are the Dominions&apos; views, the arrangement is primd facie unacceptable to them; but the formal ground for the reservation would be that the Spa percentage which represented the contractual right of the British Empire as a whole, has been departed from. (The Chairman regards this reservation, however, as really equivalent to an outright break on the scheme as a whole, inasmuch as the acceptance of the others is affected.   We agree with him.)For all practical purposes, a &quot; break&quot; in these circumstances means that, rather than be jockeyed into a final settlement which gives us less than future Debt cover plus the Dominions&apos; share, we prefer the continued operation of the Dawes Plan with or without some arrangement fixing the number of the annuities to be paid.If there is a majority recommendation in favour of such a new settlement, and this is not accepted either by Germany or by us, the majority will probably have to make an alternative recommendation in favour of continuing the Dawes Plan but fixing the number of annuities. If, however, the majority succeed m agreeing with the Germans on some new scheme unacceptable to us, they will presumably think it unnecessary to make this alternative recommendation.April 30, 1929.
