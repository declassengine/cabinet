DH,^;T TELZiGHAJl.His Majestyrs Government have as you are aware, warmly welcomed the public declaration made by Mr. Gibsoa at.. Geneva in regard to naval armaments.      They have been equally favourably impresses by sush indications as Mr. Gibson has given privately and unofficially of the President&apos;s purpose and mind.     Basing themselves on those declarations both publio and confidential His Majesty1 s Government are confident that as between our two countries a settlement could be found of the difficulty which has hitherto divided us;    that is to say that the United States and Great Britain could find a standard of parity which allowed sufficient latitude to meet the special needs of each.It is obviously more difficult to lay down rules which shall be equally applicable for all navies but they would not despair of reaching agreement with the other great naval powers if onoe the broad lines of agreement had been fixed for the naval forcer! of Great Britain and the United States..His Majesty1 s Government do not know how far it is th.e intention of the United States Government to carry the discussion at the present session of the Preparatory Committee but they would view with great anxiety the possible consequences of publicly presenting the new proposals in any detail before there has been time and opportunity for a private and confidential exchange of views sueh as is impossible for them at the moment when they are entering r,pon a general election.They hope, . therefore, that the Government of the United States appreciating both the spirdt in which they have received the United States declaration and their earnest desire ^o xetach a satisfactory settlement as
well as the difficulties created, by the iEminence of the elections will be willing to defer the public elaboration of the new tests which Mr.  Gibson has declared their readiness to apply until His Majesty&apos;s Government have been able to discuss them confidentially with the Government of the United States.This confidential discussion should    in their view take place as early as possible after the elections and might be conducted at any rate in the first instance through diplomatic channels.,Please make a communication to the above effect to Mr.  Stimson.-2-
