DOCUMENT  IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT).0 R B T . . 145 (29).COPY NO:CAB  I N E T.THE OIL POSITION IN IRAQ, i TRANS-DESERT PIPE-LINE AND RAIL&quot;&apos;AY TO THE MEDITERRANEAN.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I am In complete agreement with the Secretary ofState for the Colonies as to the importance and urgencyCP. /29). of this question.      Indeed, if anything,  I regard it aseven more urgent than he does and I hope that the form which British assistance should take andthe best method of securing the early construction of a railway and pipe-line debouching at Haifa may be taken up seriously as soon as the elections are over.     ThereIs, however,  one passage in the Secretary of State&apos;smemorandum which gives me some concern lest we should again be placed in a false position vis-a-vis of the FrenchGovernment.      On page 2 of his memorandum Mr,Ameryexpresses the fear that the attitude of the Iraq.Government and King Feisal may at any moment change and-;.hat Instead of insisting on a railway and pipe-linethrough Palestine, they may transfer their support tothe French plan for leading both through Syria.      Hecontinues:    &quot;Moreover, the ffundamental weakness of ourposition is accentuated by our self-denying ordinanceto the French.      If the need arises we can no longervery well &quot;bring political pressure to bear on the IraqGovernment to keep them In the straight path.&quot;
These words are remarkable.      It has: hitherto been the contention of the Colonial Office, as it was the basis of the original decision of the Cabinet upon the form which my communication to the French Government should take, that there had been no political pressure upon the Iraq Government. I myself thought that the letter of Sir Henry Dobbs, written on the suggestion of the Secretary of State,, could not be dis-distinguished from political pressure, having regard to the authority and influence which, any advice or s\iggestion of the representative of the Mandatory Power must necessarily have with the Iraqi Government.     Mr. Amery took a different view, but as he and I reached agreement upon the action to be taken, we merely reported what had passed between us to the Cabinet.In this paper, however,. Mr. Amery himself writes that &quot;we can no longer very well bring political pressure to bear on the &quot;Iraq Government&quot;.     The words &quot;no longer&quot; are an admission that we have brought such pressure in the pastj the qualifying phrase &quot;very well&quot; implies that it might be possibler though no doubt extremely difficult, to renew that pressure in the future.      I feel bound, therefore, to place on record my view that after what we have said to the French Government it would be dishonourable henceforth to attempt to influence the decision of the Government of Iraq in any way, and I have to ask that the High Commissioner may be Instructed in the plainest terms that, whilst H.M.Government will take whatever measures they think appropriate to secure the construction of a railway and pipe-line debouching at Haifa, he is not to use any sort of pressure or personal influence to extract a decision in this sense from the Government of Iraq, In my view our good name is at stake and the instrxictions to Sir Gilbert Clayton should be explicit.(Intd.)    A.foreign Office. 7th May,  1929.
