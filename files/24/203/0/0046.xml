[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.] .-------Printed for the Cabinet.   June 1929.SECRET. Copy No.   43O.P. 146 (29).CABINET.COMMITTEE ON THE PROPOSED GRANT OE THE GENERAL SERVICE MEDAL FOR OPERATIONS AGAINST THE AKHWAN TRIBES.REPORT.WE were appointed at a meeting of the Cabinet held on the 1st May, 1929 (Cabinet 19 (29), Conclusion 6), when Papers Nos. CP. 119 (29) and CP. 124 (29), on the question of the grant of the General Service Medal for Operations against the Akhwan Tribes, were under consideration, with the following terms of reference : &quot;That the question should be referred for settlement by the following Cabinet Committee :- The Most Hon. The Marquess of Salisbury, K.G., G.C.V.O., C.B., Lord Privy Seal.The Right Hon. Sir John Gilmour, Bart., D.S.O., M.P., Secretary of State for Scotland.The Right Hon. Walter Guinness, D.S.O., M.P., Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries.&quot;2. The Committee had the advantage of hearing the evidence on behalf of the Royal Air Force of Marshal of the Royal Air Force Sir Hugh Trenchard, Chief of the Air Staff, and of Air Chief Marshal Sir John Salmond, Air Member for Personnel, and on behalf of the Army the evidence of General Sir Walter Braithwaite, Adjutant-General to the Forces. The evidence of these officers was supplemented by the information given to us by Rear-Admiral Fullerton, Naval Secretary to the First Lord of the Admiralty, on behalf of the Royal Navy.3. To begin with, as a result of this evidence, two possible misconceptions were swept away. In the first place, it was not suggested in any quarter that the number of casualties in a campaign had any bearing on the problem before us. In the second place, it was further clear that the old words of the Royal Warrant, with their reference to battles and sieges, had never been, and necessarily never can be, narrowly interpreted.4.   The Article (653) of the Royal Warrant referred to reads: &quot; War medals and clasps are granted by Us at Our Pleasure iu commemoration of arduous campaigns and well-fought and well-sustained battles and sieges.....&quot;5.   The question before us resolved itself into this : Having regard to the precedents under which the General Service Medal has been awarded in the past, were the Akhwan operations such an arduous campaign within the meaning of the Royal Warrant as to entitle the force which took part in them to the medal ? [19394]
6. - The Committee are unanimously of opinion that the answer must be in the affirmative.  A considerable number of precedents precedents Military, Air Force, and mixed Military and Air Force were submitted, and in thejnain not contested,,, which appeared to the Committee to be conclusive.7. We were specially struck by an observation of Admiral Fullerton that, supposing a Naval Aircraft Carrier had been, say, off Koweit, and machines belonging to the Naval Air Arm had taken part in the operations, he was clearly of opinion that the personnel of these aircraft who had been in action, or in or over enemy territory, would have been awarded the Naval General Service Medal corresponding exactly to the General Service Medal with which this report is concerned.8. It is right to add that in the Naval Service this honour would hot in the supposed case be shared by the crew of the Carrier constituting, as it were, the main base from which the planes would have proceeded to the operations.9. This led the Committee to a discussion whether, in operations of this type, a line ought to be drawn between the base and the front in order to determine how far the award of medals should extend.10. The Committee, however, ascertained that in the particular instance which is the subject of this enquiry it has not been suggested that any personnel behind the advanced base should be included amongst those who should receive the medal, and we ascertained further that an award under such a limitation would be well within the military precedents.11. The Committee have, therefore, found that the General Service Medal ought to be awarded for the operations against the Akhwan tribes in accordance with the submission of the Air Ministry.Signed on behalf of the Committee. SALISBURY (Chairman).2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1, May 10, 1929.
