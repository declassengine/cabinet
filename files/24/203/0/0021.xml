Printed for the Cabinet.   April 1929.SECRET.Copy No.28CP. 121 (29).CABINET.THE MILITARY SITUATION IN GERMANY.Memorandum by the Foreign Office.(Circulated by Direction of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in accordance with Conclusion (b), Minute 1, of the Minutes of the 239 /t Meeting of the Committee of Imperial Defence. See CP. 405 (28).)IN the War Office paper on the Military Situation in Germany (C.I.D. 926-B*) it is said that &apos;&apos; in existing circumstances Germany is not in a position to wage an aggressive war, nor, possibly, even to defend herself against the attack of a first-class Power for a sufficient length of time to mobilize the nation for defence.&quot; It is generally recognized in Germany that the state of affairs is as described above; and it is usually maintained, often with sincerity, that she could not withstand an attack by Poland single-handed. It is true she enjoys the security afforded by the Covenant of the League and the Treaty of Locarno, but when she looks outside her frontiers she sees her four principal neighbours more or less confederated against her, equipped with every appliance of war that their finances will allow them to purchase, and preferring to trust to their own strong right arm for their security. It is small wonder that the whole nation reacts violently against such a state of affairs. The desire to redress the balance is universal throughout the country, and the resulting manifestations of a militarist nature become obvious to the most superficial observer, even though, as in the case of the patriotic associations, other considerations, political and psychological, contribute to give them importance.A nation vanquished in war usually has good reason to resent the terms of peace imposed by the victors, and in the case of the &quot;iniquitous&quot; Treaty of Versailles the causes of resentment, after ten years, still to a large extent persist. True that with the completion of disarmament the visible signs of military control have disappeared, but control itself is maintained. Occupation of German territory continues, though the first zone has been evacuated. The financial clauses of the treaty have resulted in the quasi-receivership of the Dawes plan, with a young financial dictator in Berlin admonishing the Government, in terms almost insulting. These are direct infringements of German sovereignty patent to every man in the street; and the eastern frontier situation, with a whole province severed from the main body of the country, is no less galling. The result is that for a whole vast range of topics depending from the above four questions all political perspective is distorted, and discussion on the real merits of any particular case becomes almost impossible. Such is the compulsion of an unanimous public opinion that the Govern -ment as a matter of fixed policy has to oppose or obstruct, actively or passively,, every measure, however trivial, designed to enforce the various controls. The voice of parliamentary criticism is silenced; large sums voted in the budget are virtually withdrawn from the control of the Reichstag and spent on purposes that cannot be avowed; scandals such as the Phoebus misappropriation, the Stolzenberg poison gas affair and the arms traffic are condoned in a conspiracy of silence. By a perfectly natural reaction the Treaty of Versailles tends to have effects the very opposite of[19186]
what was intended. The prohibition of military aviation has been one of the must potent factors, if not the most potent, contributing to the high development of civil flying in Germany. The fact that it has not yet been possible to define precisely the total of Germany&apos;s reparation liability has encouraged public extravagance in the country, and incidentally retards a much needed revision of the Constitution -and the severance of East Prussia from the rest of the country makes it impossible for the Government to consider seriously whether the agrarian policy, to which they are now wedded, really subserves the best interests of the republic.While a strong desire is everywhere evident to increase the military strength of Germany, there are also influences at work of an anti-militarist nature which merit notice.In the first place, the Treaty of Versailles, by abolishing conscription, has presented the country with half a generation of young men who know nothing of military service, and though it would be easy to exaggerate the political importance of this fact, it is one which must conduce to weakening the military spirit. Let it not be imagined that for the individual German the patriotic associations provide any efficient substitute for service in the army; the training provided can only be rudimentary. Some young men may join the vereins with a view to fitting them selves so far as they can for military diity when the country may require them; more join owing to the cult of physical fitness which is one of the psychological results of the revolution; still more for political reasons - most of all, from the German love of marching about in formation to the sound of music. It must be remembered that to some extent these associations are the rank and file of the political parties. Reichsbanner, which is numerically the strongest of them all, was started by the Social Democrats because they found that the Nationalists, through Stahlhehn. were getting too much influence in the electorate. It is a Republican organisation, and anything but militaristic. To a mere civilian, watching the vereins parade in the streets, the Rotfrontkampferbund, which is Communist, appears the best set up and drilled.   Even Stahlhelm. has something in it of the Primrose League.Disarmament has affected the corps of officers. As pay, they may receive an adequate competence, but something more is wanted to make a profession attractive and keep its votaries in good heart - and here we have the German army debarred from any but purely theoretical experience of heavy artillery, mechanisation and aviation j that is, of all the more recent developments of military science. Garrison life used to be dull and narrow, but it is now infinitely more so, and the best men prefer industry and commerce, with a chance of recovering the fortunes lost in the inflation. Still more serious, the social prestige has gone, the receptions at Court, the decorations, the cheap seats at the opera, and the free education for the children in military schools. The old army used to be cock of the walk; to-day, the army is rather a depressed industry.Still more important are the changes which have been effected in Germany by the revolution in the political organisation of the country. Germany used to be governed by a caste of territorial nobility, a hard race of men, honest, narrow and fairly efficient. They managed their estates, monopolised the higher posts in the Administration, and provided the officers for the army. This caste has been broken by the revolution, and in a short time it will be broken beyond repair; its members are financially impoverished and politically thrust into the background. The sons are becoming bankers and the daughters are marrying merchants, and the old people sit apart and gloomily murmur the shibboleths of a bygone period. Now. in the place of all this we have a republic, with a genuinely Democratic Constitution, full parliamentary control based on universal suffrage, and the Administration recruited from the bourgeois middle classes. The republics aim is to reconstruct, to heal the wounds of the war, to recover the wealth lost in the inflation; it is not militaristic in its tendencies. It is quite certain that, if conscription could be restored to-morrow in Germany, the immediate result would be a great reaction towards junkerdom: democratic control would be gravely imperilled, and the re-establishment of monarchy would follow. It is no less true that, if monarchy were now to replace the republic, a return of militarism would be almost inevitable. Of course, we are here on the ground of pure hypothesis, because neither conscription nor monarchy could return to Germany without provoking a European war ; but the practical point of all this to the German Republic is that the more influence in the body politic is allowed to military interests, the greater the danger to the republic, to democratic control of affairs; and to the classes who now hold the power. It is a fact that the republic is much exercised to imbue the army with the proper constitutional spirit.   The
governors of to-day may well desire that the disparity between the armed strength of Germany and that of her neighbours shall be remedied; but at home they are fully determined to keep their army in its proper place. When Dr. Stresemann exclaims in the Reichstag that what Germany desires is not her own rearmament, but the disarmament of her neighbours (&quot; Abriistung, nicht Anfrustung &quot;), it is unnecessary to impute hypocrisy to him. He was only formulating, with his usual perspicacity, what is the true interest and the wisest policy of the German Republic and Democracy.We may therefore assume that, while the republic is engaged in consolidating itself, and so long as the adherents of monarchy are so numerous as to constitute a formidable opposition to the existing order, it is contrary to the interests of the Government to encourage tendencies of a pronounced militaristic nature. Leaving out of account the possibility of a European cataclysm in which anything might happen, there are (a) a danger, and (6) a development, which might menace this moderately satisfactory state of affairs.The danger is that of a coup d&apos;Etat involving the overthrow of the republic and the re-establishment in some form, open or disguised, of monarchy, This danger is not very real. So long as Field-Marshal von Hindenburg remains as President, such is his loyalty to the Constitution that the danger is almost negligible. The talk of a &apos;&apos; Putsch &quot; that is now current may be discounted. If one were attempted, and it assumed formidable proportions, it would at once be countered and defeated by a general strike. When the old President dies and is succeeded by a mere &quot; man in a top hat &apos;&apos; the republic will have lost a great safeguard, but even so should be able to hold its own. The ex-Kaiser has lost the esteem of German Monarchists; the Crown Prince has not gained prestige in the country; his brothers never had any; and there is no sign that his young sons are likely to cut any figure. The influential Centre party and the whole of South Germany would be hotly opposed to any Hohenzollern restoration, while Prussia would never stand a Bavarian Wittelsbach Prince. And would all the seventeen other Kings and Princes have to return, too? The Republic is not loved, but there is nothing preferable in sight to take its place. Its situation is curiously similar to that of the French Third Republic in its early years, where, too, a redundance of Royal and Imperial pretenders cancelled each other out. The weakness of the German Republic lies not only in the fact that as yet it commands no affection, but still more in the political immaturity of the German people and in their failure so far to make a reasonable use of the democratic forms of government. The ineptitude of parliamentarism is- conspicuous; and the acerbity with which the numerous political parties quarrel with each other, till coalition among them becomes an impossibility, brings the whole regime into deserved contempt. Even so, however, perhaps Germany&apos;s difficulties to-day are no worse than those which France passed through in the seventies and eighties of the last century.The menacing development referred to above is more serious, but more remote. AVhat will the tendencies of the German Republic be if and when it has rooted itself so firmly in the country that no fear for its internal stability is to be felt ? Looking at Germany alone, the omens are not favourable, for the people are strongly conservative by nature, deeply attached to their traditions, and when the memories of recent pains have been dulled, they are likely to allow themselves to be fascinated again by the glamour of previous glories. Moreover, the German is a stirring, energetic fellow, jealous, and apt to formulate his own desires and ambitions, not according to his own requirements, but rather according to what his neighbour already possesses. It is to be feared that a firmly established German Republic might be far more restless and ambitious than ever the French Third Republic has been. But no precise forecast is possible. Too much depends on events outside Germany. How long will the present treaty restrictions be maintained ? What will be the fortunes other European Powers ? Above all, what progress will be made in general disarmament?   This last point is probably the key to the situation.Foreign Office, April 10, 1929.
