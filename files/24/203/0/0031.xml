[This Document is the Property of Kis Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.   May 1929.SECRET, y. Copy No.CP. 131 (29).CABINET.INTERNATIONAL   LABOUR   CONFERENCE.    TENTH   SESSION-1927.Proposed Action on Draft Conventions and Recommendations.Memorandum by the Minister of Labour.I SUBMIT for the consideration of my colleagues the following proposals as to the action to be taken by the Government in regard to the Draft Conventions and Recommendation adopted by the Tenth Session of the International Labour Conference. The texts of these documents have already been presented to Parliament as Command 2961 of 1927.(1.) Draft Convention concerning Sickness Insurance for Workers in Industry and commerce and Domestic Servants.(2.) Draft Convention concerning Sickness Insurance for Agricultural Workers.The slight amendment of the Health Insurance Acts necessary to bring them into conformity with the requirements of these Conventions has been made, and there is nothing to prevent ratification so far as England, Wales and Scotland are concerned.A difficulty, at once practical and constitutional in character, arises, however, in regard to Northern Ireland. The practical aspect of this was indicated by Sir Walter Kinnear, when voting on behalf of the British Government for the Convention, in the following terms : &apos;&quot;&apos; Mr. President, the British Government Delegates, in voting for the Convention, desire to explain their vote on a comparatively small point. Our-vote is given without any reservation or qualification whatever as regards the whole of Great Britain. But in Ireland, as you have already been informed by the Government Delegate of the Irish Free State, medical treatment is not -directly associated with the insurance scheme, but is given free of cost to a large proportion of the workers by the local authorities. In Northern Ireland, which has a Government of its own, the British insurance scheme is, with slight modification, in full operation, the number of insured persons being about 2 per cent, of the number in Great Britain. The Government of Northern Ireland is at present considering the desirability of bringing its system of medical treatment into complete accord with that in Great Britain, and if and when the question of ratifying the proposed Convention comes up it may be possible for the Government of Northern Ireland, on behalf of whom I speak, to accept it in toto; but at the moment we deem it necessary to point out that, while unreservedly supporting the Convention on behalf of Great Britain, we are not at present in a position to commit the Government as to the precise system of medical treatment which may ultimately be adopted for Northern Ireland.&apos;&apos;The question of the action to be taken in regard to Northern Ireland was deliberately left open at the Conference in the hope that the Government of Northern Ireland might at an early date decide to make the necessary amendments in their [19262]
Law, but it is now clear that that Government will not be ready to come to a decision on the question until after their next Elections, which will take place this month.The Government of Northern Ireland is responsible for the administration of Labour matters within that area, but constitutionally His Majesty&apos;s Government has the power to conclude Conventions which are binding on Northern Ireland (either with or without its consent), and in that event the Government of Northern Ireland would be bound to take steps to put the Convention into force. Moreover, the Parliament at Westminster has power to legislate for Northern Ireland. It is not however, practical politics to force this Convention upon Northern Ireland against the wishes of its Government.It seems clear that Great Britain and Northern Ireland cannot, for the purposes of Part XIII of the Treaty of Versailles, be regarded as forming a Federal State, nor can Northern Ireland be regarded as one of the British &quot; Colonies, Protectorates and Possessions which are not fully self-governing,&quot; so that neither paragraph 9 of Article 405, nor paragraph 1 of Article 421 of the Treaty are applicable.Further, it is generally agreed that reservations in ratifying draft International Labour Conventions are not permissible, and it is possible that ratification with a modification of the area in which the Convention is to be applied i.e., to ratify for Great Britain only might be construed as being equivalent to a reservation. Even if a ratification on these terms were accepted, it would undoubtedly create an undesirable and even a dangerous precedent.In these circumstances, the only practicable alternative is to refrain from ratification until Northern Ireland is ready to come into line. This is much to be regretted on account of the predominant part taken by the British Government Delegates in the framing of the Convention, and other countries are not likely to ratify until Great Britain has done so. On the other hand, there are serious practical objections to His Majesty&apos;s Government setting the precedent of a member of the International Labour Organisation excluding a part of its area from ratification, even if this were legally possible, which is open to doubt.I propose, therefore, with the consent of my colleagues, to issue a White Paper stating that, owing to the fact that the system for providing medical benefit in Northern Ireland is not directly associated with the Insurance Scheme, His Majesty&apos;s Government do not see their way for the present to ratify these Conventions, though, so far as Great Britain is concerned, full effect is being given to them.(3.) Recommendation concerning the General Principles of Sickness Insurance.There is no objection to the terms of this Recommendation, and it is proposed, therefore, to accept it.(Initialled) A. S.-M.Ministry of Labour, May 1, 1929.
