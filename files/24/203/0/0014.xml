CRAIGWEIL HOUSE, BOGNOR.12th April,  1929.Dear Mr. Chamberlain,The King is sorry to trouble you when you must be so very busy, but His Majesty understands that the matter about which he wishes me to write to you is s omewhat   urgent.The King has been reading the recent correspondence in &quot;The times on the subject of the proposed erection of an enormous Generating Station in Battersea, and is in entire sympathy with the views expressed by the signatories to the letter appearing in the issue of April 9th, of which I enclose a cutting.   His Majesty fee^s the greatest concern at the prospect of the atmosphere of London being still further polluted by the large quantity of noxious fumes which the station must inevitably emit -primarily from the point of view of their effect on the health of the inhabitants, but also of the damage which in the course of time they must cause to the great buildings in the heart of London.His Majesty asks why it should not be possible to folio?/ the example of foreign countries, where power stations ere erected at a considerable distance from the towns which they serve, and in surroundings where they do the least damage.In ^hi^-s^tg^e-, when every effort is being made to improve the health of the people of London by reducing the contamination of the atmosphere, His Majesty considers this project of the London Power Company particularly ill-advised and trusts that the Government will take steps, before it is too late, to prevent it being carried out.Yours sincerely,A.H.L.  HARDINGE.
15th April,  1929.Dear Hardinge,I have your letter of April 12th telling mo of the King&apos;a interest in the proposed erection of a large electricity generating station in Battersea.    I am in this difficulty in the matter that I have, as Minister of Health; no authority to control the location of the generating station.     The Minister primarily concerned is the Minister of Transport, but ad he is not a member of the Cabinet I propose to circulate&apos; a copy of your letter to the Cabinet at once so that my Colleagues may be apprisod of HisMajesty&apos;s views,  and I will also send a copy to Colonel Ashley.Yours s inc erely,N.  CHAMBERLAIN.The Hon.A.H.L. Hardinge, M.V.O., M.C^ Graigwell House, Bognor.
THE   TIMES.Tus sday, April 9th,  1929.POWER STATIONS IN CITIES. DUST AND WASTE GASES. OBJECTIONS TO BATTERSEA SITE. To The Editor of The Times.Sir,It appears to us that the schemes of the Central Electricity Board to erect super generating stations at Battersea and elsewhere in the midst of large towns have been framed without sufficient regard to the welfare of the community as a whole.We are particularly apprehensive in respect of the station at Battersea for the following reasons(1) The proposed concentration of coal combustion is on a scale unprecedented in this country, and experience at generating stations of similar character but on a much smaller scale with modern appliances eliminating smoke Indicates   that the emission of large quantities sf sulphurous acid causes serious damage to vegetation, besides corroding stonework, ironwork, and other metals and Injuriously affecting paintings, coloured fabrics, and the like.    It has also been found that the modern methods of burning coal result in the discharge of large quantities of fine dust and grit, which are a serious inconvenience to surrounding residents.(2) In the case of Earnworth versus Manchester Corporation, recently decided in the Court of Appeal it was admitted that the Barton power station had caused serious damage to crops for a radius of at least one mile.   This on a daily consumption of some 500 tons &amp;a compared with a minimum daily consumption of 2,000 tons as - now proposed at Battersea.(3) As the prevailing winds in London are south-west, the normal flow of fumes from a station at Battersea would take a line over the Tate Gallery^ Lambeth Palace; St. James !s Park, Westminster Abbey, the Houses of Parliament, St.Thomas&apos;s Hospital, Whitehall, the National Gallery, &amp;c*, while Battersea Park and Chelsea Royal Hospital are both close to the site of the proposed station.   The corrosion of the stonework of the Houses of Parliament is known to be due to sulphurous vapours;    the fumes from Battersea will be far more corrosive than the present atmosphere.(4) The riverside is especially susoeptible to fog, and when such occurs a great concentration of sulphurous and carbonio acids will take place.   These acids&quot;lthe fumes of which, apart from condensation, are heavier than air) would descend on the surrounding district to the serious detriment of health, vegetation, and buildings whether of stone or brick.
(5) Consequently,  it seems evident that a generating station of this magnitude, should not &quot;be permitted in ^or close to a large town, unless sure provision is made for preventing the emission of these deleterious gases and for eliminating all dust and grit from flue gases.    It appears to &quot;be doubtful whether sure provision Is at present ^ contemplated or whether it is even economically possible &quot;on the.....Batter sea site.(6) There is the further point to consider - namely, that if such a station were erected and the damage that is anticipated took place., it is inevitable that injunctions would be sought or claims for damages put forward.    The promoters would, therefore, be faced with the possibility of closure, the certainty of expensive litigatj on,  and the probability of having to face cost-ly compensation.(7) In Germany, where large scale electricity production is  farther advanced than it is in this countryn the general practice is to produce the current on the coalfioldSc Current of high voltage Is transmitted for as groat a distance as 300 miles^  and in some cases the difficulty of carrying overhead cables through the outskirts of big cities is obviated by laying a cable In tho river Rhine -an accommodation which could as readily be provided in the Thames o(8) With regard to London, there is no need to cope with any distance approaching 300 miles, because in East Kent, some 60 miles away, there is a coalfield ready at hand., where a generating station on the seaboard could be so placed that the prevailing wind would take any fumes out to sea and where any damage done would at least be a minimum.    A further advantage of a generating station on a coalfield would be the avoidance of additional transport of coal and removal of ash at a centre already over-burdened with traffic.(9) With these considerations in view and, above all, the danger to our national treasures, to the health and comfort of the near by population and to the vegetation of our parks and open spaces, it seems manifest that the present, project is ill-advised, particularly as there are alternatives which have technical and economic advantages.Fortunately little has yet been done on the Battersea site and, in view of the considerations set out above, we ask the Government to institute an immediate and searching inquiry into the proposal from all points of view.Yours  faithfully,C.B.
