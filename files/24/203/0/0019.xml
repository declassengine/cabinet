Printed Jor the Cabinet, April, 1929.SECRET.Copt No.   o QOCP. 119 (29)THE CABINET.PROPOSED  GRANT   OF  THE   GENERAL   SERVICE MEDAL FOR OPERATIONS AGAINST THE AKHWAN TRIBES.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY  OF  STATE FOR WAR.1. The Secretary of State for Air proposes that the General Service Medal shall be granted to members of the Air Force who took part in the operations against the Akhwan tribes dmlng November, 1927, to May, 1928.2. The General Service Medal and Clasps are granted under Article 653 of the Royal Warrant for Pay, &amp;c, of the Army, 1926, &quot; In commemoration of arduous campaigns and well-fought and well-sustained battles and sieges.&quot;3. I do not object to the grant of an Iraq active service medal by King Feisal, such as was granted for similar protective police work done in Kurdistan in 1925, but I am loath to cheapen the General Service Medal and Clasps.4. If the Akhwan operations, in which there was one death in action, are rewarded by the General Service Medal, then there may be claims for similar rewards for operations in the Penjwin area in 1926-27 when larger forces took part and there were 4 killed and 13 wounded, and in the Sudan, and in Shanghai and North China, or even on the Rhine.5. All these operations are in the nature of police work rather than &quot;arduous campaigns and well-fought and well-sustained battles and sieges,&quot; and it may be desirable, if the local Iraq medal is not thought sufficient, to have a police medal, but I hope it will be possible to protect the General Service Medal from debasement.L. W.-E.The War Office, 23rd April, 1929.
