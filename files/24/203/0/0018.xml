Printed for the Cabinet.   April 1929.SECRET.Copy No.2SCP. 118 (29).CABINET.IMPERIAL PREFERENCE SUGAR.Memorandum by the Chancellor or the Exchequer.I CIRCULATE for the information of the Cabinet a minute which has been addressed to me by the Board of Customs and Excise on the subject of the Sugar Preference. Of course any suggestion of giving direct loans or grants to Mauritius and the West Indies for the purpose of securing improved methods and better organisation in the sugar industry would need the most critical examination. It would be a most unusual departure for the British Government to undertake to provide funds for the relief of a particular industry in a well-established and financially independent Colony, and there would be no adequate means of securing, by means of control exercised from this country, that the conditions proposed to be attached to the suggested loans or grants were effectively fulfilled.Paragraph 11 of the Report of the Cabinet Committee on the Sugar Preference Duty (CP. Ill (29)) is as follows:-&quot;We have requested the Chairman of the Board of Customs and Excise to consider whether any objections which the Refiners may be expected to raise are likely to give rise to serious difficulty, and if so, to advise whether any variation of the proposal would remove or minimise those objections.&quot;The proposal is that there should be an increase of Is. a cwt. in the preference on Empire sugar, and it is agreed that any increase will have to apply not only to sugar from Mauritius and the West Indies, but also to sugar from other parts of the Empire, and that there must be a corresponding reduction in the Excise duty on home-grown beet sugar.In reply to the question put to me, I am bound to say that I anticipate serious difficulty will arise if it is proposed to take away from the Refiners some of the advantages given to them by the changes made last year.The original proposals of the Refiners were to reduce the duty on raw sugar only, leaving refined sugar, whether imported from foreign countries or produced at home from beet, to bear the old rate of duty. These proposals, however, at once aroused considerable opposition from Mauritius, from Australia, and from the home-grown beet interests, in view of the fact that their products would have been left at a.disadvantage amounting to 2s. 4:d. per cwt. as compared with refined sugar turned out from the refineries in this country.After considerable negotiation the Refiners eventually agreed, under pressure from us, that there should also be a reduction in the duty on Empire refined sugar and in the Excise on home-grown sugar, though the reduction in those cases was at aw. s. c.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1, April 22, 1929.Chancellor of the Exchequer,Sugar Preference.[19181]
lower proportionate rate than the reduction on the raw sugar. These modified proposals were then accepted, also under pressure from us, by Mauritius and Australia, and by the home-grown beet interests who were largely influenced by the consideration that their position would be greatly safeguarded and improved if the adoption of the proposals put an end to the vigorous opposition of the Refiners to the Beet Subsidy. After a great deal of negotiation and discussion, a settlement was arrived at on these lines, to which all the parties assented, and since then there kas been peace between the Refiners and the home-grown beet interests.The net result was that while the Refiners were given a substantial advantage in competition with the imported foreign refined sugar, home-grown beet sugar and refined Mauritius sugar were left at a disadvantage of 9%d. per cwt., compared with the Refiners.If, therefore, the preference on Empire sugar is now increased by Is. a cwt., and the Excise duty on home-grown sugar reduced by the same amount, the result will be that so far from the Refiners having an advantage of tyd. per cwt., they will be put at a disadvantage of 2%d. per cwt.It is certain that they will object to this, and if it is imposed upon them it will very likely have the effect of reviving all their opposition to the Beet Subsidy, and we shall be back again in the region of controversy and quarrel between the two interests. Moreover, the Refiners will probably be less inclined than ever to agree to such a revision of last year&apos;s concordat in view of the fact that the beet sugar factories are now refining imported raw sugar in their off-season, and have, there-fore, entered into direct competition with the Refiners not only during the beet season but throughout the whole year.So far as the home-grown beet interests are concerned, while it is true that they would probably welcome a reduction in their Excise duty, they may think that such an advantage would be dearly purchased if it involved a recrudescence of the hostile attitude and agitation of the Refiners.The fact is that it is impossible to alter the scale of sugar duties for the benefit of any one interest without causing some detriment to one or more of the other interests concerned. For all these reasons we should be very reluctant to have to disturb the settlement which was so laboriously arrived at last year, and it must not be forgotten that the trade as a whole greatly dislikes constant Tariff changes.I am asked also to advise whether any variation of the proposal would remove or minimise the above objections. The Cabinet Committee, in Paragraph 6, Stibsection (3), of their Report, say that the most economical and defensible expedient would seem to be a temporary increase in the sugar preference, though they admit that it may not be effective. I suggest that it is open to considerable doubt whether an increased preference for seven years, which is what is proposed, costing  1 million a year in the first full year and tending to increase in subsequent years, is really the best way of meeting a temporary emergency, particularly when only about one-third of the cost to the Exchequer will go to Mauritius and the West Indies. The remaining two-thirds will go to the other Empire producers in Natal and Queensland and to the home-grown beet interests, although none of them are really in need of additional assistance.The difficulties of Mauritius and the West Indies are mainly due to the very low world price of sugar at the present time, and, while it may be the case that there is no immediate prospect of an improvement in prices, it is hardly conceivable that they can remain at the present low level for anything like another seven years.In these circumstances, it seems worth considering whether direct loans or grants to Mauritius and the West Indies would not be a more economical and defensible expedient than an increase in the preference. The Cabinet Committee agreed that there was considerable room for improved methods and better organisation in the West Indies and Mauritius and it would seem easier to enforce such improvement by attaching conditions to any loan or grant than by giving them an increased preference, which wrould be very difficult to withdraw later on.The Cabinet Committee, in the final sentence of their Report, recommend that negotiations should be undertaken with the Refiners and other interests concerned forthwith, and I shall be glad to receive instructions as to whether we should now proceed to open up such negotiations.(Signed) F.
