Willert from Mr. Steward. Following is text of Lord Cushendun&apos;s reply.Lord Cushendun said - &quot;I think it must be obvious that it wauld be impossible for any member of Commission to deal in any adequate way at this moment and offhand with declaration which has been made by delegate of United States but that declaration strikes me as being so important that I would like to make one or two observations upon it without delay.      No one can fail to have been struck with friendly conciliatory and helpful spirit of Mr. Gibson!s declaration and I should like,  so far as I am concerned speaking on behalf of British government,  to say that it is in that spirit we also desire to approach this very complicated and difficult question and that so far as there are points in dispute either with United States or with any other State represented here, we shall endeavour to meet them In exactly that same spirit.      I would go a little further than that I cannot comrr.lt myself at the present moment with regard to any specific proposition contained in that declaration to which we have just listened.      We should have to see it in print
before v;e could do that but following it as closely as I could I am able to say that so far as any general principle is concerned I think there was nothing that Mr. Gibson has said with which I cannot express my agreement.      Certainly I am in agreement Kith generality of remarks that he has made and principles which he has laid down.One thing that he said I welcome particularly and that is his allusion - it was only a passing allusion - to Kellogg Pact.      Having had personal privilege of signing that great instrument on behalf of British government, I  certainly am not disposed to belittle Its importance.      I believe that it is most profoundly important with regard to whole outlook of world,  I believe that signing of Kellogg Pact has done more to promote security of world on which disarmament must proceed than any other event.      I do not think it has even yet been fully realised how Important it is and I am therefore very glad Indeed that delegate of United States has insisted upon that point.      Another point on which I am in full-  agreement with Mr. Gibson Is when he  says that in naval matters we desire not only limitation but reduction;    that is alsobthe desire of British government and we,  like the United States, desire limitation and reduction to be applied to all classes of vessels.      If in some negotiations which have taken place we have provisionally at all events,  consented to a scheme of reduction which left any classes of vessels outside,  that was not because we considered that an ideal solution of problem but merely because in the interests of agreement we were willing to forego.some part of our ideal in order to get an agreement upon otherso     ?/e have never concealed the fact that we desire,  if we can get agreement upon it,  limitation and reduction as applied to all -classes of vessels.      When one Is speaking about reduction,  I hope I may be allowed to remind
Commission that this time twelve months ago I publicly intimated that British government would be glad to see a further reduction of size of those categories covered by Washington agreement and also prolongation of their life,  that is to say longer period before they could be replaced.     We also Intimated readiness if our colleagues would agree to total abolition of submarines.      Therefore we have already shown our willingness to carry further the principle of reduction of vvhich we have tentatively laid foundation and we are anxious to promote it to fullest possible extent.     One very important matter which was laid down by Mr. Gibson and on which I cannot say very much until I see his words - but I notice how very important it is - was when he spoke of equivalent naval values and I think he Intimated that government of United States had been examining problem from this point of view with object of arriving at some system of equivalent values based upon other factors besides mere tonnage.      I think he mentioned speed and some other factors.      Well I do not like to say very much upon, that point until I have further information but I.may say that for myself I entirely agree that It is along those lines that we ought to investigate the problem.      I think that the British government have also to some extent been investigating the possibility of arriving at equivalent values, taking into account those factors but obviously this is a matter which Is extremely technical..     It Is naturally a matter which my government could only examine In conjunction with expert advice and I will refrain from saying more at present moment than&apos;   that I am quite certain that any suggestions of that sort which may be made by government of United States and any information as to course of their study of this subject will be most carefully and In friendly spirit examined and considered by British government. I cannot of course commit them In any way to result that might
flew from that examination but I certainly welcome whole spirit in which Mr. Gibson has spoken to us to-day and I am sure that my colleagues will feel the same, whether they represent naval powers or not, because he has spoken in spirit which cannot but be helpful for progress of o\ir work,     Finally I may say this:    I think that his declaration is so important and has such a close bearing upon whole of naval question that it must profoundly affect our work here,,      I am not prepared at present moment to make any proposal with regard to how we should treat it but I think that Commission will agree with me that it is a declaration which cannot be passed over and which is likely to have the most profound Influence upon our deliberations&quot;.End of speech which in conjunction with American declaration appears to have made profoundly hopeful impress!on.Whitehall Gardens, S.W01, April 23rd,  1929.
