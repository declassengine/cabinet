EXAMINATION OF THE PAMPHLET CALLED &quot;WE CAN CONQUER UNEMPLOYMENT,&quot; AND OF THE MELCHETT-TILLETT REPORT.PART I.Chapter I. Introduction.Prime Minister,ON the 14th March, 1929, the Inter-Departmental Committee of Officials on Unemployment (constituted by you last autumn) received your instructions that the Departments concerned should prepare, for circulation to the Cabinet, memoranda examining the recommendations contained in the pamphlet entitled &quot;We can Conquer Unemployment&quot; (Cassell and Co., March 1929) and in the Interim Joint Report on Unemployment by the Conference on Industrial Reorganisa-tion and Industrial Relations (&quot; Melchett-Tillett Report,&quot; March 1929).2. In accordance with these instructions, the report takes the form of independent examination by the Departments concerned of each item as a business proposition, accompanied by memoranda by the Ministry of Labour and the Treasury (assisted by the Economic Adviser) on the general aspects of State Development schemes in relation to unemployment.3. Although the two documents under examination were published in the same week and necessarily cover much of the same ground, they are widely dissimilar in outlook and in their suggestions. The Melchett-Tillett report is industrial and rests its main hope for the future upon the reorganising process in ordinary industry; the pamphlet &apos;&apos; We can Conquer Unemployment&apos;&apos; looks to the State to create an employment market to absorb the unemployed pending restoration of normal con-ditions by normal means. The items in each document are therefore examined separately.N. F. W. F.April 2, 1929.
PART II. &quot; WE CAN CONQUER UNEMPLOYMENT.&quot;Chapter II. General Memorandum by Ministry of Labour on State ConstructionalSchemes in relation to Unemployment.A. Practicability of Proposals for Direct Employment.(a.) An Analysis of the Statistics of Unemployment.1. The pamphlet begins: &quot; For eight years more than a million British workers, able and eager to work, have been denied the opportunity.&quot; The suggestion of this sentence is that the recorded figures of unemployment each week, and each year, represent a standing army cut off from their normal occupation, and unable to find an alternative means of livelihood, and all able and willing to engage in a new occupation if it can be devised for them.2. This is a false picture of the unemployment problem. The fact that the Live Register of unemployed under the Unemployment Insurance Acts has only fallen below a million on a few occasions in eight years does not mean that at any time there are a million people surplus to the requirements of industry. In each year the number of individuals who have registered as unemployed, for short or long periods, is from 3 to 4 millions. Which of these form the &quot; million &quot; who are denied the opportunity of work, and what has happened to the others ? Why is it that, if the register of unemployed at any given period represents the &quot;surplus,&quot; that register can be reduced by 200,000 in two weeks, as has happened in the past two weeks?3. At all times the employment market, over a wide part of industrial production, works in an irregular and spasmodic manner. The Unemployment Insurance Acts have created, as a part of their administration, a very sensitive instrument for recording each irregularity; unemployment benefit is paid to men out of employment, subject to certain conditions, of which one is that they record the fact that they are unemployed. A part of the register consists of persons staking out a precautionary claim to unemployment benefit, and in many cases this claim does not mature because the workman becomes absorbed again into industry within a day or two.4. Apart from this constant changeover in personnel, it must be borne in mind that the whole Live Register consists of workpeople of all ages and of all degrees of physical capacity with widely differing periods of continuous unemployment and widely differing expectations of reabsorption into industry. At no time would all on the Live Register be willing or able to accept whatever alternative employment is offered. This fact is fundamental to the whole question of the extent to which the State need or can profitably provide a substitute employment market.5. It is only possible to give a rough estimate of the numbers of persons registered as unemployed who would be likely to benefit from a scheme of State-aided works. In the first place, there are certain classes which can quite definitely be excluded from consideration. The number of Women and girls should obviously be deducted from the field of eligibles available for direct employment on national schemes of work. Of the class of boys 16 to 18 years of age, some might be suitable for employment of the kind contemplated; it must, however, continue to be the policy of the Ministry of Labour not to place boys in employment which carries with it such little prospect of advancement as road construction, land drainage, &amp;c. In the interests of the boys themselves it is better that they should remain &quot; unemployed &quot; .and attend the Juvenile Unemployment Centre. Accordingly they may be excluded. Another class which can be disregarded is that of persons registered as temporarily stopped. This includes short-time workers and persons who have a definite expectation of re-engagement by their employer within six weeks. They are still closely attached to their normal occupation and represent part of the &quot; slack &quot; that can be taken up by industry by an improvement in trade, whether seasonal or otherwise. Some of them might&apos;be attracted by more regular employment on road work, &amp;c, but, having regard to the industries in which short time is most prevalent,
the numbers that will be so affected can be treated as negligible for our present purpose. Casual workers, mainly dock labourers, may also be disregarded, though a few might be recruited for some forms of work of the kind contemplated. The latest figures available, analysed by industries, are in respect of the 25th February, 1929, when  the total number of insured persons* registered as unemployed in Great Britain was 1,412,818. This figure was exceptionally high because of the frost; it has since fallen by mere than 200,000 (120,000 wholly unemployed), but later analyses by industries are not available. A more reasonable figure to take for the purpose of analysis is that in respect of the 17th December, 1928, when the total was 1,290,371 for Great Britain.6.   If we deduct Women and girls         ... ... ... 230,700Boys  ...          ...          ... ... ... 19,800Men (temporarily stopped) ... ... 158,500Men (casuals)               ... ... ... &apos;     74,400Total       ... ... ...      483,400we are left with a total of about 807,000 wholly unemployed men.7. Certain deductions must be made from this figure to arrive at an estimate of the reserve of labour available for direct employment on road construction and land drainage.(i.) So far as housing, telephone and electrical development and London passenger transport are concerned, the additional labour to which it is assumed in the pamphlet that direct employment could be given under the programme would be drawn mainly from the men at present unemployed in these industries.(ii.) In industries Avhere the percentage of unemployment is five or less, labour cannot be withdrawn to any appreciable extent. So far as they are employable at all, men in these industries must be regarded as attached to their own industry.(iii.) In industries with more than 5 per cent, unemployment, the large propor-tion of the men wholly unemployed are &quot; attached &quot; to their own industry, and will be absorbed with varying rapidity. Skilled men are more &quot;attached&quot; than unskilled^ particularly if the alternative employment offered is mainly pick and shovel work, as is the case with more than half the pamphlet programme. Except in the building trade, no reliable figures are available of the proportion of skilled men among the unemployed. It is not a high proportion, and much of it consists of the older men who would be less inclined, and less suitable, for alternative employ-ment, particularly in districts away from home. It would be mistaken policy to employ on heavy outdoor work men with a high degree of inherited or acquired skill in such trades as vehicle building, clothing, wood-working, printing and paper trades, &amp;c. In occupations connected with transport and communication services, textiles, distributive trades, &amp;c, a large proportion of the unemployed must be regarded as &quot;attached.&quot;(iv.) A further deduction must be made on account of age. From one of the sample enquiries conducted by the Ministry of Labour the following age distribution of the male unemployed appears :  ApproximateAge groups.

For the purpose of this memorandum the figures taken relate to the insured persons registered ;as unemployed and not to the weekly live register figures, which are not capable of analysis by industries.
(v.) As regards physical suitability, reference has already been made to possible deterioration of skill which would result from the employment of highly skilled men on road work, &amp;c. It must be admitted that at the other end of the scale there is a considerable number of men of doubtful employment value registered as unemployed. The condition for the receipt of benefit is that the man must be &quot;capable of work&quot; and not &quot;capable of any kind of work.&quot; If the Health Insurance authorities certify that the man is capable of light work, he can qualify for unemployment benefit if the other conditions are satisfied. There would be an appreciable number of persons registered as unemployed whom a road contractor would refuse to accept or who could not reasonably be submitted.(vi.) The field for work to be performed away from home and at labourers wages will be further affected by the numbers who are married or have dependants.0,ses authorised for dependants&apos; benefit.

Such men will, on the whole, be less willing to accept the work, unless induced by higher wages or by allowances, and, what is equally important, they will be much more difficult to absorb into normal industry at the conclusion of the programme.(vii.) It is presumed that every attempt will be made to do the work at &quot; commercial stroke,&quot; with power of dismissal for inefficiency or slacking. Unless this is insisted upon, a large force of labour may become accustomed, over a period of 2 years, to &quot; relief works stroke,&quot; in some ways more demoralising than actual unemployment.   This condition will produce a further reduction.After reasonable allowance has been made for the various factors referred to above, it is estimated that the total number of men, 18 to 50 years of age, who could be regarded as available for direct employment in State-aided schemes of road work and land drainage under commercial conditions of employment and rates of wages, lies between a figure of 250,000 and 300,000.(b.) The Detailed, Proposals.8. While the proposal to provide employment by road work, &amp;c, is perfunctorily commended in the Melchett-Tillett Report, it forms the whole basis of the Pamphlet. Nearly every phase of national activity, except the normal working of ordinary industry, is touched upon in the pamphlet, but the most important proposals, in terms of employment, relate to roads, houses, telephones, electricity, land drainage and London passenger transport. The financial, technical and practical aspects of the programme are being covered by separate Departmental memoranda. It is the province of the Ministry of Labour to consider the question of recruitment, accommodation, &amp;c, and the general effect on the employment market.9. Housing. The pamphlet contemplates the provision of work for 60,000 additional workpeople. These are to be employed on 35,000 additional houses (1 man 1 house per year plus indirect employment), so that the annual average can be 200,000 houses.In July 1927, when the building industry was working at full pressure to secure the subsidy which was being reduced in September, there were 60,000 unemployed in the building industry; of these 9,000 were craftsmen, 9.500 painters, and 41,500 labourers and others. Even, therefore, at the peak rate of construction, when over 200,000 houses a year were being produced, all the workers nominally attached to the trade were not employed. To add 35,000 houses a year to a production of 165,000 houses does not mean the additional employment of &quot; 1 man per extra house &quot; ; much of the difference is made up by overtime, extra effort, employment of master craftsmen, &amp;c.In July 1928, when the reduction in the subsidy is presumed to have had its effect, there were 82,000 in the building trade wholly unemployed. Of these, only 20,000 were craftsmen, exclusive of painters.
If 60,000 additional men (or even 35,000 direct) are to be profitably employed on building subsidy houses, there will have to be an increase in the number of craftsmen. There is no provision for this in the scheme, and the attitude of the building industry, both employers and workmen, to the introduction of &quot; trainees &quot; has not been helpful. Subject to that, however, it may be said that the possible intake of, say. 20,000 additional workpeople for the suggested additional programme is not fantastic. It represents the increase in unemployment between July 1927 and July 1928.10. Telephone and Electrical Development. It is difficult to comment on the amount of employment that would be afforded by the programme contemplated, because the extra expenditure suggested is on such a scale that, if it is to be spent in two years, a substantial increase in plant would be necessary. The plant required for the programme would probably prove excessive for the commercial load that would subsequently be put upon it, and probably the contractors, like the armament contractors during the war, would require some indemnification for the uneconomic expenditure.If these difficulties and other financial objections can be got out of the way, undoubtedly a large additional labour force would be absorbed. Whether it would be on the scale contemplated would depend on the proportion of expenditure on plant, and on, e.g., cable-laying. The manufacture of electrical equipment generally employs a small number of men per  100 spent, owing to the cost of material, the fineness of the work, and the amount of work that is done &quot; on the machines.&quot;11.   London Passenger Transport. The pamphlet allows for this service 24,000men.If this extension of London transport services could be done in a year, the estimate of the men to be employed might not be wildly wrong; certainly, to complete the work in twelve months or even two years would require a large labour force. As a mere matter of finding the men, i.e., from the angle of employment, they are not impracticable proposals, assuming that they are financially possible.12.   Road Construction and Land Drainage.With the programme of road construction, to employ 350,000 the first year and 375,000 the second, and land drainage with 80,000 in each year, entirely different considerations arise. It may be stated definitely, from the figures in paras. 1-7 above, that if this programme is work for the workless,&quot; all labour to be unemployed and recruited through the Employment Exchanges, and if the other parts of the programme are to be carried out simultaneously, the force of unemployed labour available, i.e., willing to take the work and reasonably capable of executing it, is quite inadequate to meet the demand for the roads or land drainage. The demand could only be met on the assumption that all the unemployed are available, fit, and anxious for alternative employment, and the falsity of this assumption has already been demonstrated. More of the programme could be carried out if it is permitted to draw off other labour by better wages and conditions, especially agricultural labour in the case of the roads, but this is not intended, though it will be difficult to prevent. The argument that even if it happened, the vacancies thus created would be filled from among the unemployed is only correct within certain limits. Vacancies in agriculture, for example, do not draw off miners from South Wales.13.   As indicated in paras. 1-7, it is very difficult to estimate the number of workmen able to do this hard manual labour in the open, on road making and lam drainage, who can really be considered &quot; unattached.&quot;  After making due allowance for the absorption of labour that the rest of the programme directly entails, it is probably between 150,000 and 200,000.To this low estimate, it may be objected that in mines alone there are 150.000 wholly unemployed. But of these, about 40,000 are over 50, and of doubtful value for road making and land drainage.14. The remainder, however, form a substantial number. (The iron and steel workers Avill theoretically be absorbed in telephones, bridges, electrical development, and the London Transport Service; the building workers will be employed on the new houses, a proportion of the engineers will be drawn into the electrical engineer-ing industry; the only avenue open to shipbuilders will presumably be work on the
roads; the transport workers would certainly be busy on the rest of the programme, and many of the textile workers would not be suitable.   The ordinary movement of trade and the employment, indirect and direct, that the rest of the programme might entail- would certainly absorb many of the remaining employable workpeople.)Whether the remaining miners and the other classes of labour not absorbed elsewhere will really be &apos;&apos; available &apos;&apos; for the road work depends on the conditions under which the work is done. The pamphlet is emphatic that the road programme and land drainage are not relief works. &quot; They are to be done where the work is required as distinct from doing work where unemployment exists.&apos;&apos;15. It is a truism of the mining situation that much of the unemployment exists where there is no work and no likelihood of any work in the future.The isolated villages of Durham, and the villages up the valleys of South Wales, do not need the luxuries of grand trunk roads.It must be assumed, therefore, that, if the road programme is to be carried out mainly by miners and unskilled shipbuilders the two trades least likely to be picked up by the indirect effects of the rest of the programme most of the men will have to Avork away from home most of the time. Indeed, the pamphlet specifically says that the roads will be in the &quot; comparatively prosperous parts of Britain.&quot; This involves two practical difficulties. Accommodation for a working gang of, say, 500 is not easily arranged, except in huts, and hutting road construction adds enormously to the cost. Also the miners, and most other workers, except the regular road navvy,, dislike it intensely. Further, of the 150,000 unemployed miners, over 100,000 are married. The earnings of the men, allowing deduction for broken time, are not likely at present rates to exced 45s. per week, and will not be regular. Over a long spell, such as a year, relatively few men, judging by the experience of the Ministry, will be able or willing to attempt to keep two homes on this figure. Even if their board is only 20s. per week, the margin for personal    luxuries &quot; does not exist.16. It is necessary to remember that the unemployed miners to-day, after 18 months effort on behalf of the colliery managements to bring together a personnel of high quality, represent broadly the less effective members of an industry which, until recent times, has always afforded itself the luxury of a substantial proportion of low-quality labour. Although it is not true of the majority, there is a substantial minority unwilling and unable to work as hard as the ordinary labourer in other trades. Further, all of them are gregarious, and dislike leaving their mining villages. So long as in one way or another, by unemployment benefit, poor law relief, Lord Mayor&apos;s Fund, &amp;c, there is enough coming into the household to keep them from starvation, and they have no rent to pay, they will be very reluctant to recognise the necessity of seeking work in other industries away from home. If, therefore, the road programme is seriously to attempt to absorb most, if not all, the employable miners and shipbuilders, concerted measures of compulsion, e.g., by withholding unemployment benefit, stopping outdoor relief, &amp;c, will be necessary in the case of an appreciable number.17. In the case of land drainage these difficulties will be all the more serious. In the first place arises the question of wages. The miner will not come and drain a farmer&apos;s land at the agricultural wage. But what will the agricultural labourer (a skilled man) say if the miner (wholly unskilled on this job) is to obtain much higher wages, and how will it be practicable to prevent the agricultural labourer being drawn off to the work?&quot;Where are the 80,000 men on land drainage to live ?They will be bound to work in relatively small groups, scattered over rather lonely areas. The experience of the Ministry over the last two years suggests that the miners will not take such work, under such conditions.(c.) Conclusions.18. The general conclusions to be drawn from the foregoing analysis are that the labour force of unemployed willing^ to take work of this kind and reasonably able to perform it on an economic basis is quite inadequate for the whole of the programme outlined in the pamphlet. The force does not exist and the authors of the pamphlet have misread the unemployment problem.At the same time there is a substantial number, probably not less than 250,000 men, in all trades, who cannot count during the next year or two upon regular employment in their own industry or their own locality, who are capable ot
employment, mostly upon unskilled work, upon the types of work envisaged. As they stand they are a continuing and inescapable liability upon public funds.Whether or not the creation of alternative employment for them, by a programme of public works financed by the State, is wise, depends to a great extent upon the questions examined below.(B.) The Effect of State-Aided Work on the Employment Position.19. Apart from its financial reactions, a big programme of State-aided public works has a disturbing effect upon the general industrial position. It tends to produce an artificial rise in wages on constructional works of all kinds and to increase the wages of &apos;&apos; heavy labour &apos;&apos; disproportionately to the increases of skilled men; if it is a long programme with continuity of work promised to the personnel, it draws off labour which would otherwise find employment, though perhaps with less regularity, in normal industry, without being able to ensure replacement; it raises difficulties in regard to, e.g., allowances for working away from home which react on many industries; it is liable to produce lazy work or a disregard on the part of Contractors of the need for economy, every additional charge being attributed to the alleged poor quality of the labour, and thus to degenerate into &quot; relief works.&quot;20. In a developed country such a programme is, broadly, justifiable only on one of three grounds that the works are urgently required; or that, though their urgency is not so immediate, they will so improve productive efficiency that their cost will be repaid, even if indirectly, by expanding revenue ; or that they are wanted to keep from demoralisation a valuable labour force temporarily out of work but confident of reabsorption in its own industry within a short period.21. The first two points are outside the immediate scope of this memorandum, but the third is very important to the Ministry. It was the justification for the earlier programmes of public works, because it fitted the conception at that time of the unemployment problem. But this conception has now been abandoned. The pamphlet is at one with the Transference Board in dismissing the idea that the present unemployment in the industries most affected is merely a phase of the ordinary trade cycle. Following upon this admission, the pamphlet recognises that the men who are employed on the programme of works cannot expect to go back to their old industry at the conclusion of the works. It is one of the inexorable difficulties of all programmes of this kind that they do come to an end rather abruptly, and the more men they seek to employ immediately the sooner they end.The pamphlet expects, therefore, particularly of the road workers, that they will be absorbed fairly rapidly into the normal industry of the area in which they were working.&quot; They proceed : &quot;We sympathise with the aims of the Transference Board in their policy of transfer.&quot; The same purpose doubtless applies to the men on land drainage.22. This point is fundamental. If the Transference Board were right in con-sidering the seriousness of the real unemployment problem to lie mainly in its local concentration in &quot;derelict&quot; areas and the accuracy of this diagnosis is now generally accepted all unemployment policy must be directed to breaking up this concentration, and securing the absorption in other areas and industries of the men who are still employable. The objections to any programme of public works are much less strong if it can be shown that it will certainly have this result, because the works thus become a means to an end, and not an end in themselves.The pamphlet contemplates that 430,000 men are to be on the roads and land drainage. At what rate do the authors of the pamphlet seriously expect that this force, almost entirely consisting of &quot;general labourers&quot; for ordinary industrial purposes, and containing a high proportion of married men, will be absorbed into normal industrial activity in other areas &quot; ?23. There are theoretically no limits to the rate at which industry can expand and absorb labour. But transference is not a matter of theory ; it consists in moving men and women away from their homes and familiar surroundings, to live among strangers, to work in unfamiliar occupations, under conditions as to such practical matters as rents, wages, cost of travel, cost of living, &amp;c, often quite different from those to which they nave been accustomed, to compete with a hostile labour-force of
general labourers. In the end it consists in obtaining, openly or covertly, a preference for the &quot;foreigner&quot; against the &quot;local,&quot; not always justifiable on grounds of strict economic superiority.24. It consists, too, in finding work for labourers in prosperous industries, which are doing all in their power to reduce the numbers of their unskilled personnel.It consists in finding accommodation for transferred men, often in places where housing is not expanding as quickly as local industry. Slough is an excellent example of an area which cannot house its rapidly increasing personnel; much of the working population of Slough comes in daily by train, but for labourers, particularly men accustomed to walking to their work, the cost of fares is serious, especially coming on the top of the cost of rents.25. In six months the Ministry of Labour has transferred about 15,000 persons of all ages, of whom only a small number are married. Perhaps another 7,000 have transferred themselves.At the end of the first year of the policy it is hoped that, the Ministry will be able to show 34-40,000 transfers, with another 10-15,000 transfers by personal effort. Of all these transfers probably 80-85 per cent, will be effective, i.e,, the workpeople will have been absorbed into a new area, though not necessarily into the industry into which they first came. Their employment will not, in many cases, be permanent, but coming into prosperous areas, they will obtain work with much greater regularity than in their own area.26. This result has not been obtained from any easily-tapped spring of sympathy for the miners, who form the bulk of the transferred men. It has come from heavy and continuous efforts on the part of the whole Employment Exchange machinery, by wide experiments in training boys and young men, by generous grants towards removal costs, by enlisting the help of voluntary workers to receive men and to assist them in finding lodgings. It has been done in the face of concealed  and sometimes open hostility from local labour, and despite a singular lack of enthusiasm for the policy from organised labour, and despite too the various forms of help for the depressed areas which tend to anchor men there.This commentary is not intended to magnify the achievements of the Ministry, but to put in perspective the difficulties. Men would not understand that they had been given six months&apos; work on a road passing through a prosperous area in order to give them a chance of leaving the road to take more permanent work in the area. They would have a six months&apos; job; they would work it through and then they would go home and wait for something else to turn up. A Road programme of the size contemplated for two years would simply create a problem of &quot;demobilisation&quot; at the end of the period.27. In face of all the experience of the Ministry, any suggestion that 430.000 men of this type will be absorbed into industry in one year, or two, is nonsense. Even if, as indicated above, there are only about 150,000 to 200,000 men available for the roads and land drainage, it will be impossible to effect the absorption of this number in two years. With two years&apos; work ahead of them the men would, while it lasted, refuse to accept offers of ordinary labouring jobs, which in many cases are their only chance of final absorption in industry; the scheme would thus retard and not help transfer.Undoubtedly some of the men will become absorbed; undoubtedly also many of the remainder will have recovered some inclination to work which will help to secure earlier absorption, but any suggestion that the whole programme is merely a &quot;bridge&quot; from idleness to normal employment within two years disregards all the real economic and personal factors in the problem.Conclusions.28. The reading of the Unemployment position in the pamphlet is wrong, and the labour force available would be quite inadequate for a programme of the size proposed. At any date the unemployed consist of three main classes : (1) the largest class those who are out of work but will secure a regular succession of employment spells within a short period. They are not &quot; unattached &quot; and could not be drawn off to alternative employment without dislocation to the industries to.which they belong.   For them the scheme of unemployment insurance is appropriate.   (2) The
smallest class, though larger than is commonly admitted, who through age, physical deficiency, or other personal shortcomings, can only expect at best irregular employ -ment, except in times of boom. They cannot be employed economically, and for them some form of Poor Law relief is necessary. (3) The intermediate class of men, who in age and physical fitness, are of relatively good employment value, but who cannot count, in the near future, upon regular employment in their own industry or locality.29. This third class numbers, probably, 250,000 in all trades, of whom miners form a substantial proportion. Owing to their concentration for the most part in a few areas where the opportunities for employment are very limited, their ultimate employment depends upon the absorption into other areas and industries.They tend to slip down into the lowest category and are a continuing liability upon public funds. They must be still regarded as industrial units, and cannot therefore be treated as outside the field of unemployment insurance. They are, however, under present conditions, very bad &quot; insurance lives &quot;.; as a class they are heavily debtors to the Insurance Fund and constitute a hazard to the Exchequer; their continued unemployment constitutes a serious and constant drain on the Unemployment Fund and jeopardises the finance of the scheme, which must still be considered as, broadly, the appropriate treatment for the normal irregularity of the employment market.30. The questions raised by the pamphlet are, therefore, whether, on balance, it is desirable to give this class some work of a kind which is in itself reasonably economic, and whether, if this is considered desirable, the work can be carried out under economic conditions and will lead in a short time to the ultimate absorption of the men engaged upon it in ordinary industry. The ordinary economic and financial objections to the policy of State-aided work for the unemployed have not been stated at any length in this memorandum, which is primarily concerned with the immediate effect upon employment. But in weighing these objections, it must be remembered that the present position creates a burden upon public funds which is not growing-less ; the expenditure involved in maintaining an unemployed man and his dependants  estimated at not less than  60 per annum- is not directly productive, and the receipt of the money for nothing over long periods is producing a demoralisation which has an economic as well as a social side to it.31. The programme contemplated in the pamphlet cannot be carried out, among other reasons, because there are not enough men &quot; available &quot; to do the work. But a smaller programme could be carried out, so far as the labour force is concerned, and the financial and other objections are obviously weakened by a reduction of the programme. It would be of considerable practical value to the Ministry of Labour in its policy of transfer if, for example, a trunk road construction programme, employing about 15,000 men for a spell of six months, could be undertaken mainly in the South, Midlands and South-West of England, the men to be recruited as to 75 per cent, from the mining areas, on the understanding that they were expected to take more permanent employment as and when it was offered to them during the engagement on the road work. It is the scale of the proposed programme that makes it impracticable. But if, on balance of economic advantage, it is considered desirable to put in hand a modified programme of public works, to provide for the suitable &quot;workless,&quot; who are to be recruited through the employment exchanges, it is essential, in the view of the Ministry of Labour, that the work should be carried out under economic conditions, and should aim, as rapidly as possible, at the absorption of the men engaged upon it into ordinary industry. From this standpoint it is necessary that the work should be carried out under ordinary commercial conditions, by contract, at ordinary contract prices, with a minimum allowance for &quot; quality of labour,&quot; and with the usual power to the contractor of dismissing men for inefficiency or slacking, such dismissal to have the proper consequences upon the man&apos;s right to receive support from public funds.32. It is necessary that it should be carried out, as far as possible, in areas where the chances of absorption into the industry of the locality, both during the work and on its completion, are reasonably good. If any part of the programme is to have preference, it should be housing in the prosperous areas. The Ministry of Labour are receiving evidence from several important centres of industrial develop-ment that local housing is not increasing proportionately to the capacity of the area to give employment to additional workpeople.   If, therefore, there is to be any
development of State assistance towards housing, it should be directed specially to areas which are rapidly developing their industrial capacity, and so afford an opportunity of absorption for workers from other areas. Next in value, for this purpose, comes a road programme of trunk road construction, to be carried out mainly by transferred labour, and passing through as much of the prosperous parts of the country Midlands, South and South-West as possible.33. It is necessary that it should be stated openly at the beginning, and emphasised throughout to the workmen engaged upon it, by action as well as words, that the programme does not mean the acceptance by the State of an obligation to find work, or the creation of a substitute employment market, or even the provision of a job, at whose conclusion the man may return home to live on public funds. It is intended to help the men to regain the will and the capacity to work, and to put them into touch with districts where a man, if he tries, can obtain work.It is to the normal working of ordinary industry that the employable population must look for its livelihood. Unless this is made clear, and the policy framed for the purpose, the institution, under present conditions, of a big programme of public works will create an appetite that will be satisfied only with increasing difficulty, and the effort to recruit the labour force required would be likely to lead to the offer of high rates of wages, affecting the costs of production in other industries.Addendum by Government Actuary and Ministry of Labour on the Proposals in the Pamphlet on the Finance of Unemployment Insurance.1. On page 58 of the pamphlet two accounts are given, one showing the receipts and payments of the Unemployment Fund for the year 1928, the other showing what those receipts and payments would be if there had been 750,000 fewer unemployed.The two accounts are, arithmetically, approximately correct. The comments made upon them, however, on page 59 of the pamphlet, are in some respects misconceived and incorrect.2. It is assumed in the comments on the accounts that the persons who would be absorbed into industry by being put to work on the schemes adumbrated would be those who are &quot;permanently&quot; unemployed, and who would, consequently, receive more in benefit during the year than those included in the unemployed who are in fact on short-time. It might be said that the paragraph seems to be framed so as to lead the reader to believe that the 750,000 to be absorbed would, if they remained unemployed, draw  57 a year each, as against the average of  34 actually paid in 1928.   It would, no doubt, be denied that such an interpretation was intended.3. It would, of course, be wholly incorrect to assume that a considerable proportion of people on the unemployed register remain wholly unemployed and on benefit throughout the year. An investigation made into a typical sample of the register in April 1927, showed that only 10 per cent, of the men then on the register had drawn benefit for seven-eighths of their first benefit years which ended before April 1927. More than two-thirds had drawn benefit for less than 50 per cent, of that period.It would, indeed, be fantastical to put the savings on the assumed absorption of 750,000 men at  57 a head. Such figures would in fact mean a saving on benefit amounting to  42,750,000. As the total amount paid in 1928 was only  44.300,000, this leads to the absurd result that the 580,000 people remaining on the register would between them receive only  1.550,000 in the course of the year, or Is. If/, a week each.4. The line of thought leading to the suggestion that the saving resulting from the absorption of 750,000 more workers into industry would be based on  57 a head appears to be based on the common fallacy that there is a standing army of unemployed, who are without work from one end of the year to the other. This is nothing like the truth. Of the persons included in the sample investigation made by the Ministry of Labour in 1927 : 25 per cent, received benefit for less than one-eighth of the year.40 per cent, received benefit for less than one-quarter of the year.67 per cent, received benefit for less than one-half of the year.Nearly 75 per cent, received benefit for less than three-quarters of the year.
Chapter III. Roads and Bridges.    (Section II of Pamphlet.)(i.) Memorandum by Ministry of Transport.Progress during the Years 1925-28 Inclusive in Relation to Charge of Neglect of Roads.1. The first point made in the pamphlet is that recent policy has had a blighting effect upon the development of our road system, and that the whole movement for a better road system has lost its momentum. This criticism is enforced by reference to the fact that successive sums of  7 millions and  12 millions have been transferred from the Road Fund balances to the general uses of the Exchequer, and that a sum amounting in 1928 to  4 millions has been appropriated to Exchequer uses out of current taxation. The retention in the Exchequer of part of the licence duties upon private cars and motor cycles has been justified in recent Budget state-ments on the ground that there is a luxury element in the ownership of these vehicles.2. The best answer to this point of criticism is to be found in the progress made during the present Parliament. This has been explained in a Memorandum circulated by the Minister of Transport (CP. 67 (29)) dated the 5th March, 1929, and in a speech by him at Blandford on the 9th March. The principal points emerging from these statements are : (i.) Net payments from the Road Fund for highway purposes have risen from  5 millions in 1920-21 to about  19 millions.(ii.) Since 1920, successive programmes of road and bridge work have been expedited for the relief of unemployment, involving an expenditure of about  57 millions, of which total national funds will have provided about  37 millions. Of the grand total no less than  26 millions have been spent since 1924, and  13 millions remain to be spent.3. The works include practically the whole of the Greater London Arterial Road programme recommended by a pre-war conference with important additions, costing in all  14 millions, and including 200 miles of new arterial roads.Similar important works in the provinces have been carried through, of which good examples are the Birmingham-Wolverhampton Road, the Edinburgh-Glasgow Road, the Newcastle-Tynemouth Road, the Mid-Glamorgan Inter-Valley Road, with ring roads round Sheffield, Leeds, Ipswich, &amp;c. The Mersey Tunnel is under construction, and the Road Fund is contributing  2-^ millions to its cost. A tender has also been accepted for the construction of the Liverpool-East Lancashire Road, the total cost of which is estimated at  3,000,000.An important Trunk Road Programme, initiated in 1924, is nearing completion. It covers 400 miles of trunk roads and the bridges thereon, and involves a total expenditure of  8 millions, of which the Road Fund has found  6^ millions.Many important new bridges have been constructed or are approaching completion, e.g., Berwick Bridge, the Newcastle-Gateshead Bridge, Boothferry Bridge, Queensferry Bridge over the Dee, &amp;c.(iii.) 230 miles of by-pass road have been put in hand during the last nine years, and special sums have been allocated for reconstruction of weak bridges.(iv.) During the past four years nearly  10-^ millions has been made availablefor maintenance and improvement of rural roads, (v.) In London, tenders have been accepted for a new Lambeth Bridge and parliamentary powers have been obtained for three cross-river bridges at Richmond, Chiswick and Hampton Court. The Bill necessary to authorise the Victoria Dock Road is in its final stages, and several important negotiations for improvements in London are in progress.To sum up, in the last four years old schemes have been carried through, new works on a substantial scale put in hand and some important new projects have been formulated.
Nature and Scope of the Proposals Outlined in the Pamphlet.4. Passing from the critical aspect of the pamphlet to its constructive ideas, it must be admitted that it is desirable to lay down definite principles and to plan ahead comprehensively conceived programmes for adapting our roads and bridges to modern requirements. Apart from certain exceptions the schemes and kind of work envisaged in the programme are in the main works of public utility which it would be desirable to carry out over a term of years. Indeed, it may be said that the main sub-divisions of the programme and the items comprised in those sub-divisions are based upon the Annual Reports on the Administration of the Road Fund and other information issued by the Ministry of Transport. Extensive programmes for the reconstruction of the trunk roads, for making ring roads round large cities, for reconstructing weak bridges and removing level crossings have been in execution and formulation ever since the formation of the Ministry of Transport. Consequently, a great deal of material is available to suggest the lines on which such work could be extended, and the authors of the pamphlet in the main merely propose to condense in the very short period of two years work which would, under present procedure, normally take a long term of years to execute economically and efficiently.5. The plan itself, it is true, postulates &quot; emergency powers.&quot; But the obstacles to any such concentration of work as it proposes are formidable and whatever powers of overriding private interests and the views of local authorities were obtained, it is not considered possible to compress into two years anything approaching the expenditure suggested. Before considering how far it might be desirable to attempt such a programme, it is, therefore, necessary to examine how far it is practicable.6. It is suggested that &quot;before the end of twelve months the number of unemployed workers could be reduced to normal proportions.&quot; In the summary on page 52, the pamphlet said that, within the first year from the schemes starting, work would be provided for 350,000, and within the second year 375,000 men, and to achieve this result the whole  145 millions must be actually disbursed in wages and material. It has, however, been the experience of the Ministry of Transport that, after schemes of this kind have been approved, the progress during the first year is only sufficient to call for the payment of 20 per cent, of the grant from the Road Fund, while in two years the figure may reach 50 per cent, of the total. In the case of the East Lancashire road, the local authority advise that only one-fifth of the total expenditure is likely to be incurred in the first twelve months of the contract period. The peak of employment cannot be reached so rapidly as the pamphlet suggests.It is stated that &quot;labour will begin to be absorbed within three months.&quot; It would be possible in certain directions (e.g., in connexion with a limited Trunk Road Programme) to begin work on certain sections after about three months, but generally speaking, schemes of any importance require at least twice as long as this to prepare and negotiate. Just as the peak of employment must be delayed longer than the optimistic calculations of the pamphlet allow, so the date at which the volume of employment can rise to any substantial figure will also be longer postponed.7.   The reasons are stated in detail hereafter : (i.) Agreement must be reached with owners of land and property. Whatever drastic compulsory powers were taken, delay cannot be eliminated. Where important interests are affected by departmental action the protection of the courts may be invoked, (ii.) The pamphlet appears to contemplate direct action by the State on a vast scale and would not seek to work mainly through the existing machinery of local government. If the various highway authorities were superseded in this way an acceleration of work would undoubtedly be secured in some directions, but it is not practicable to ignore the views and wishes of local bodies as to the line which a new road is to take or the manner in which the road of which they Avill retain the maintenance is to be improved. If there is to be any contribution from local rates, the responsible finance committee must scrutinise estimates, &amp;c. Local authorities are also interested in the amenities and town-planning of \  &apos; their districts and must be consulted in such matters.
(iii.) If the machinery of existing highway authorities is to be used, some delay is inevitable in launching a large new programme, but extensive resort to direct works would involve an expansion of the central organisation, which could not be achieved in a few days or even weeks, while the need for proper plans and financial scrutiny would remain.(ivo) Consultation and agreement must take place with railway and canal companies and other statutory undertakers, whose rights cannot in the public interest be ruthlessly ignored, and who may be faced with serious technical problems connected with the working of their undertakings, (v.) Proper engineering plans and surveys must be prepared unless there is to be (in addition to extravagant finance) a risk that projects will be subsequently held up.(vi.) It will often be necessary to obtain specific Parliamentary authority for particular projects.The delays inseparable from the causes just stated must obviously be enormously increased if the normal volume of work is suddenly expanded manyfold.8. These various difficulties are not theoretical or carping comments, but result from experience of emergency road works. The consequences of attempting to expedite unemployment programmes on even a modest scale have not been always satisfactory, and anything approaching in magnitude the projects now put forward Avould produce most serious difficulties under the following heads : (a.) Unless careful surveys have been made and engineering details properly worked out, gross extravagance may result. One case under the old unemployment programmes can be instanced where a new road was begun, estimated to cost  96,000. The Local Authority spent the whole of this and left the road unfinished and derelict. After prolonged negotiations, a larger Authority agreed to finish the work at an additional cost of  44,000. Excess expenditures on hurriedly prepared projects are common to every unemployment programme.(b.) The demand for essential materials outruns the supply.Competition in contracts is largely eliminated and prices are forced up so that the result may be that the value obtained for every million pounds expended diminishes as the aggregate expenditure rises.These considerations are as much applicable to road works as to other engineering works. They apply even in a virgin country, and with still greater force in an old country like our own with its large urbanised and industrial areas.(c.) The drastic process of renovation of the highway system throughout its length which is contemplated in the pamphlet, if it were practicable on other grounds, could not be undertaken without the most serious interruption-tion to road traffic. If an enormous mileage of road were to be suddenly put under repair or reconstruction, and if attempts were made to reconstruct within two years a very large number of weak bridges, there would have to be most extensive diversions of traffic, accompanied by long detours. Serious wear and tear would take place on alternative routes not suited for the traffic, and great expense would be incurred in making this good and in erecting temporary bridges.The pamphlet implies that there is a growing congestion on the roads due to increasing volume of road traffic, but in fact the steady progress of road improve-ments has largely counteracted this tendency. The prosecution of motor coaches for excessive speeds attained on long journeys goes to show what facilities our roads provide for rapid transport. In no other country has motor coach traffic reached such proportions.9. Number of Men Employed on Roads per Million Pounds Spent. The pamphlefs figure of 5,000 men directly and indirectly employed for a year per million pounds is higher than experience justifies, since it is taken as an average figure for works of all kinds. If works are to be started all over the country simultaneously, they cannot be specially selected to give the best results in absorbing labour. Recent departmental experience suggests that 2,000 man years per  1 million spent is a maximum figure for direct employment on the roads themselves where the works are undertaken in urbanised areas under modern contracting
methods. To this may be added another 2,000 men employed at a distance in quarries, transport, &amp;c. For works in a rural area a figure of 2,500 men employed directly upon the site might be reasonable, if it were possible to select schemes on which a high proportion of unskilled manual labour could be used and insisted on, but such selection ceases to be possible when a wide area has to be covered. It should also be remembered that there is a large body of semi-employed men in the quarrying and other trades or on the fringe of these industries who would have to be brought into whole-time occupation before additional men could be engaged. It must, therefore, raise false hopes to suggest that the whole of the indirect labour would mean additional men in employment. From the foregoing, it will appear that the average number of men likely to be employed for a year for each million pounds expended will not reach the figure of 5,000 assumed by the pamphlet, and when allowance is made for the many special works, bridges, &amp;c, included in the programme, where even the figure of 2,000 men directly employed may not be attained, it is probable that the average figure of total employment per  1 million expended will be nearer 4,000.10. Details of Suggested Programme. The foregoing considerations are applicable to the whole scheme of road works dealt with in the pamphlet. It may be interesting to examine the main heads of the programme separately in some detail.They may be summarised as follows : 1st Year.     2nd Year.        Total.   Millions.      Millions.      Millions. (1.) Trunk Roads ... ... ... ... 42(2.) Ring Roads ... ... ... ... 20(3.) Special Work of Reconstruction and Improvement on DistrictRoads       ... ... ... 21 9 30(4.) Work of reconstruction of weak and dangerous Bridges ... 10 27 37(5.) Special London Schemes ... ... ... 16145National System of Trunk Roads.11. The maps and the proposals in the pamphlet are borrowed from the pro-gramme which the Ministry of Transport have been successfully encouraging the road authorities to carry out. Important work of this character cannot be economically undertaken without due preparation involving complete engineering surveys, consultation with Valuation Department, in order that the cheapest land may be acquired, the comparison of estimates for alternative proposals, &amp;c. Local Authorities have been keenly criticised for carrying out widening schemes without sufficient regard to preservation of beautiful or interesting buildings, old cottages and natural features of the countryside. The general public are stoutly averse to the drastic and mechanical slashing of wider roads through the landscape in the manner which would be inevitable if an unprecedently large programme is to be carried through in two years, and are becoming more and more alive to the folly of destroying the great asset which natural beauty and historical associations afford.The Ministry of Transport has recently worked out an extension of a Trunk Road Programme which might involve an expenditure of  8 to  10 millions over a period of 4 or 5 years, but a great deal of detailed work would have to be done before any substantial volume of work under this programme would be actually in progress. A substantial volume of work of this kind will no doubt be carried out in the near future as a normal feature of Road Fund expenditure.12. Classified Roads. -It is said that some increase should be given in the grants for the maintenance of classified roads. Two years ago the grant on Class II roads was raised from 25 per cent, to 33^ per cent. As from the 1st April next, these grants will be further increased to 50 per cent., and the grants on Class I roads simultaneously raised from 50 per cent, to 60 per cent. This decision was announced some time ago, but is ignored in the Pamphlet.13. Ring Roads and By-pass Roads. The construction of ring roads is apt to be a particularly protracted operation, owing to the fact that the line of road generally cuts across the railways and canals radiating from the city.   The North
Circular Road round London has been under construction for eight or nine years; work is still proceeding and is not likely to be finished for another eighteen months.The carrying out of proposals for by-pass roads is also far from simple. Local amenities have to be very carefully studied, residential properties, sports grounds, allotments, &amp;c, are frequently affected, and local feeling often runs high. Sometimes as many as five rival schemes are put forward, from which a choice has to be made, after detailed discussion Avith all the interests affected. The Bromley By-pass in Kent has been under discussion since 1914, and no decision has yet been reached by the local authorities as to the best alignment to adopt. In the case of the Beith By-pass in Ayrshire, the controversy as to the most suitable line to adopt has lasted two years or more.  At the same time, some schemes of this kind are urgently needed.14. District Roads. The figure of 55,000 miles quoted in the pamphlet as the length of &quot;scheduled&quot; roads is an under-statement; the actual length is about 70,000 miles. It must be remembered that the total of 138,086 miles of unclassified roads mentioned in the pamphlet includes a great mileage of urban and suburban roads, which do not need reconstruction. Moreover, there are many parts of the country where a proposal for the immediate tarring and modernising of all the bye-roads and lanes would arouse considerable opposition, as horse-owners, dairy farmers, &amp;c, usually prefer the old-fashioned type of road. The inconvenience caused to road users by spending  21 millions in one season on the strengthening of these roads would be almost intolerable.15. Of all the proposals in the Road Programme of the pamphlet this proposal actually to spend  21 millions in the first year is especially open to the charge of extravagance and impracticability having regard to the low traffic value of the country lanes and bye-ways which contribute a great part of the length of these unclassified roads. While admittedly large sums will have to be spent in due course upon bringing the more important unclassified roads up to a standard equal to the strain of modern traffic, an actual expenditure on this scale, even with the most generous assistance from national funds, would be beyond the financial resources of the Local Authorities and beyond the capacity of their organisations, and it can hardly be contemplated that scattered work of this character on rural roads could suitably be undertaken by a central department at the sole charge of the Road Fund.16. Bridges.-There can be no objection in principle to the rebuilding of all weak bridges if unlimited funds are available, and a steady programme of such reconstruction must form an important item in any road policy.Arrangements were made a year ago for the compilation of a complete register of all weak bridges in the country, with particulars of their dimensions, &amp;c. so that an order of priority might be established, and an estimate formed of the expenditure required over a term of years. The rate of progress already attained in bridge reconstruction is far from negligible. During the present financial year plans have been approved by the Ministry of Transport for about 440 new bridges. To start rebuilding all weak bridges simultaneously would dislocate road communications to a serious extent. Ten years should be allowed for such a programme if the convenience of road users and economy of construction are to be studied.17. In addition to making special allocations from the Road Fund for this purpose, the Department has before Parliament the Bridges Bill, which will accelerate the progress of reconstruction of bridges in the ownership of statutory authorities.It is in connexion with bridges in particular that the need for special parliamentary sanction often arises. Frequently more than one Local Authority is concerned. Engineering difficulties are also specially apt to arise. The amenities of the town or the landscape have specially to be considered (e.g., Richmond Bridge). Attempts to brush aside the feelings of the locality, the views of the architectural profession and those of all persons interested in the beauty of England will defeat their own object. The design and structure of bridges, destined for a life perhaps of centuries, call for more than three months&apos; deliberation in an old country like England.Special attention is already given to the elimination of level crossings at important points.18.   Special Work in London. The Victoria Dock Road is included4 in the Special Programme of  16 millions at a cost of  3 millions.   The finance of this scheme is already arranged, and the Bill is now in its final stages in this Session of [19066] &apos; D
Parliament. It is hoped that work will be begun in the course of the summer, but the scheme involves a certain amount of rehousing in the congested area of West Ham and the actual inception of work may not proceed very rapidly for this reason.The Dartford-Purfleet Tunnel is cited as one of the projects which could be started within three months. For this scheme there is only a preliminary report by-consulting engineers with four sheets of drawings attached. The preparation of full engineering details necessary to enable tenders to be obtained would require about a year&apos;s work and study; in the preliminary report the Consulting Engineers include a provision for Parliamentary expenses on the assumption that Parliamentary powers would have to be obtained, as for the Mersey Tunnel which is now in progress. It is, therefore, difficult to see how work could be begun in less than 18 months. Moreover, recent developments at Tilbury may well lead to a reconsideration of the site proposed for the tunnel.Grants have been offered for many works in London to the Improvement Authority the London County Council which that Authority is deferring to carry out in view of its heavy capital commitments in various directions.19. General Considerations. (1.) The general implication of the pamphlet is that the whole of the expenditure which it proposes will be a net addition to other employment. Even in relation to road work itself this is by no means wholly true. Apart from special items, such as the Victoria Dock Road, there is in progress and in contemplation, as has already been pointed out, a substantial volume of work normally undertaken year by year out of the Road Fund, and there is, of course, no suggestion that this should be shut down or drastically curtailed in 1929-30 or the ensuing year.(2.) This memorandum does not deal with the financial objections to a policy of borrowing heavily upon the security of the Road Fund for the anticipation of capital works, since this aspect of the matter is being separately treated by the Treasury.(3.) It is understood that the Committee have asked the Inland Revenue Department to report direct upon the question of betterment and the possibility of recouping cost by exercise of existing powers to buy land or by extension of those powers.(4.) It is unnecessary to deal in any detail with the reactions of the proposed road policy upon other forms of transport. It is, however, interesting to note that in the section dealing with canals the authors of the pamphlet admit that the development of motor transport is an important factor affecting the canals, and they would appear to have some misgivings as to whether they would be wise in embarking public funds upon their development. As regards the railways, it is obvious that a widespread anticipation of road development throughout the country in excess of any needs of current traffic, designed to enable the heaviest road vehicles to run day and night with little check from the existence of weak bridges, &amp;c, on any part of the road system, would stimulate a transfer of traffic from rail to road and would tend to draw away from the railways even the heavy traffics. The ultimate effects of such a policy not only upon the railways themselves, but upon industry, and particularly the basic industries of coal-mining, iron and steel, must be serious. The pamphlet is vague as to the way in which the huge expenditure contemplated is to be met. It is merely stated on page 24 that &quot; we are not here considering the question of whether the money for the roads is being raised at present in the best and fairest way.&quot;(5.) Reference has already been made to the reactions of the proposals upon highway authorities. The policy of successive Governments has been to leave the responsibility for the improvement and maintenance of roads where it now rests, i.e., on the highway authorities of the country, and, in accordance with this policy, the Ministry of Transport has avoided, so far as possible, the function of actual construction and maintenance of roads. Most highway authorities are, and have been for several years, working practically to their full capacity within the limits of their present resources. Fortunately, the Road Fund has been able to meet all its commitments, as they fall due, out of the year&apos;s revenue. The local authorities have similarly been meeting their expenditure out of revenue, or short-term loans  usually 7 to 15 years, according to the nature of the work. This would appear to be the most economical method of financing highway development, and by this means the roads of the country have been so maintained and improved as to enable them to carry vehicles which have doubled in number in the last six years. The pamphlet&apos;s alternative would apparently be to press forward at once with a vast programme of road improvement and construction, financed entirely from national funds, raised by way of loan on the security of the Road Fund.   This could only be done by the
central Department itself, and would involve the supersession of the highway authorities of the country on an extensive scale and the setting up of a centralised national road system. Once the State had assumed so many direct responsibilities it might not find it easy to divest itself of them. We should then be left in effect with a system of national roads, for the maintenance and development of which a central department would be wholly responsible. It may be answered that, in respect of the great national routes, some development of this kind is inevitable, but it may be held that, if so, it should come about in the gradual evolution of a carefully thought out policy rather than as the legacy of an emergency scheme.(ii.) Memorandum by Department of Health, Scotland.1. It is not possible from the manner in which the figures have been presented to check how much it is proposed should be spent in Scotland, nor where the roads are to be constructed. There is in the book a map to a very small scale, which shows particularly certain trunk roads extending from Carlisle to the extreme North of Scotland, and from Berwick to Aberdeen. These proposals, it is presumed, are chiefly for widening existing roads. The total amount proposed to be spent on trunk road schemes seems to be 92 millions. This excludes the amounts allocated for the construction of weak and dangerous bridges and special London schemes, as the report indicates that most of the dangerous bridges are in England.If, therefore, ll/80ths of the 92 millions would fall to be spent, Scotland&apos;s share would amount to about 13 millions.2. The policy of the making of new, and improving existing, roads is not new. It has been in operation since 1923, when in that year and the following year about 10,000 men were employed in Scotland on roads and other works for the relief of unemployment. The number of men so engaged, however, was gradually reduced until this year, when, owing to a more liberal grant, the unemployment relief work has again revived. There is, however, not so much road work undertaken as water works, drainage schemes and sewage purification works.3. It was hoped in 1923-24, when a large body of men were employed, that the works then undertaken would be sufficient to bridge over the period of depression. This, however, did not altogether materialise, and in many cases the men who were engaged on the work were only afforded temporary financial relief, and found themselves again at the finish of the work without employment.In connection with the grant for unemployment now in force, the policy to a large extent seems to be one of taking the men from the depressed areas into areas not depressed, where it is thought the men so transposed will, on the cessation of the works for which a grant has been given, be absorbed in the community of the area and so removed and induced to settle down in an area not depressed. One of the difficulties in this scheme is the cost of providing accommodation for these men in the area to which they have been transferred.4. A study of the roads shown on the map which it is proposed to widen and strengthen makes one pause and consider whether or not it is a wise policy to spend money at this time on roads, say, from Oban via the Caledonian Canal to Inverness and thence northwards to John o&apos; Groats. Similarly, from Perth and Dundee north-wards via, Forfarshire and Braemar to Aberdeen. The construction of these roads, no doubt, would afford facilities for tourists and others in the North of Scotland over a road having a first-class surface, but this does not appear to be a direct or advantageous way of helping the unemployed and at the same time assisting industry to get back to its stride. It is suggested that it would be much better in the meantime to concentrate on road work in the industrial area of Scotland, e.g., the Forth and Clyde Valley, and the counties of Fife and Ayr, where unemployment is marked; for, by so doing, the roads constructed would not only afford employment to the men at their own doors but a quick and convenient form of transit for industry, which might play its part even small in reducing costs to the manufacturer, thereby extending his business and so in time absorbing men.5. It would be quite a pertinent question to inquire where these roads should be made and when work in a highly industrial area such as this could be commenced in view of the negotiations which might be necessary and the other arrangements for starting the work.   It would appear that this would not be very difficult, as at the
present time very large regional town planning schemes are being prepared for the city of Glasgow, Renfrewshire and Dumbartonshire, Aberdeen, Dundee and other industrial centres, and these proposals are now definitely in shape and well advanced. The roads shown on these plans have in most cases been laid down after careful consideration by expert Technical Committees in charge of this work. These roads must sooner or later be constructed, as they are necessary for industrial transport through these areas and for the opening up of land, and for building purposes generally. The work of constructing them could not, of course, be commenced until Government or Departmental approval in some form had been obtained, but there does not appear to be any difficulty in accelerating and putting through these schemes with the utmost despatch. In any case, it might be quite possible to put through the road part with the full knowledge that the position of the roads had been carefully considered in relation to the growth of these areas as a whole. The modern town plan is more of a skeleton plan than 10 years ago, one primarily of roads and zoning. There are now so many provisions in the public statutes and bye-laws that the infilling of the maps could be left over meantime without prejudice to the schemes. If schemes as presently propounded are put through, local authorities could then enter upon the land, on giving three months&apos; notice, and work commenced. The construction could be done through the local authority and the money recovered by the local authority under suitable terms as and when the land was built upon. A. considerable sum of this money would not be recoverable so far as the local authority is concerned, as many of the roads would be wider than the statutory width and the extra width would be a cost borne by the local authority. An advantage in promoting such schemes under the Town Planning Acts is that claims for betterment by the Local Authorities can be made so that, where new or improved roads open up land for development, a substantial part of the increased benefit comes back to the local authority.6. If an unemployment scheme somewhat on these lines was embarked upon, it would be more beneficial and more economical than the construction of roads through highland areas with a sparse population. Such schemes would not only have the advantage of directly assisting industry at the present time and of providing work for the unemployed men near their homes, but would avoid the necessity for temporary accommodation and the other attendant difficulties. Above all it would open up new land for development in a,nd around cities and industrial areas.7. There is still another profitable field open for the use of unemployed. In respect of the strengthening of existing highways it is not probably generally realised what enormous sums of money are being spent annually on road surfacing owing, in a great measure, to the absence of a suitable foundation for modern traffic. About 1914, when Scottish road experiments were being carried out, the roads were opened up to ascertain the nature of the foundation where experimental stretches of road materials were to be laid down. In almost every instance it was found that even in the principal highways in Scotland carrying the heaviest traffic the road foundations were more or less composed of from 3 to 4 inches of ordinary road metal. Almost universally this exists to-day and upon this foundation improved forms of road surfacing are being laid down to accommodate the modern heavy traffic, with the result that the surface disintegrates and goes to pieces in practically one season. The Road Authorities are not able to finance the putting in of a thoroughly good foundation, so they have from year to year to be assisted by the Ministry of Transport in providing money for this somewhat extravagant road-surfacing. If a good foundation could be put in the surface, maintenance would drop to a very small figure. Some authorities have faced the expenditure, notably a portion of Stirling-shire, Stirling burgh, Falkirk burgh, and some parts of the county of Lanark. In these instances, a heavy concrete foundation has been laid down with a surfacing of bitumen, and the annual cost of maintenance has been practically nil. Work of this kind could be extended indefinitely. It is admirably suited for unemployed, and it would be carried out in the regions sub j ected to heavy traffic, which are the industrial areas, and where the men could again be employed without temporary accommodation being provided.8. There are also many roads near the industrial areas which require to bo widened and upon which traffic at the present time is congested and held up, thereby causing a loss in time in the transit of material which adds in turn to the cost
2.1of production. These widenings are not difficult to arrange, and work could be commenced on these on very short notice. Notable examples of this class of work are already to be found in Lanarkshire, particularly in the neighbourhood of Hamilton burgh.9. In addition to the main lines of traffic which have been shown on town plans, there is still another field open for the construction of minor streets to open up feuing land. It is probably not quite realised how much house-building by private enterprise is presently being retarded owing to the want of access to suitable sites. There are many sites upon which prospective house-builders would put their houses but for the absence of a means of access. Unless the site is near a highway or a street already constructed, the cost of making a road to isolated sites &quot;will not in most cases be undertaken by the Superior, nor is the prospective builder willing to take the risk and carry the financial burden until the land so opened up is fully developed. It has been found, however, in many districts where a new street has been laid out, that within a very short time it has been built from end to end with houses under private enterprise. If work such as this under suitable arrangements with the municipalities and the landlords could be undertaken, it would be a great fillip to the building of houses by private enterprise, and in a large measure assist the present congestion in housing. The lack of accessible building sites is responsible for the ribbon development which is taking place along the highways leading to and from all the large cities and towns. As a matter of fact, people nowadays do not want to build on these heavily trafficked roads owing to the disturbance by traffic and dust, but they are driven to build owing to the absence of sites served by roads remote from the highway.10. On the question of the recruitment of labour, we have had many oppor-tunities when reporting on unemployment in past years of seeing the large number of youths between the ages of 17 and 23 who are temporarily engaged on road works. It is suggested that in any future work these youths should, if possible, be put on to such sections of the work as would give them a technical training so as to fit them for a career outwith the scope of the casual labourer. These youths were employed on unskilled road work working honestly and conscientiously for two years as labourers, driven, no doubt, to do so by the force of circumstances. This is just the period when they should be receiving a technical training by way of apprentice-ship, and, not having had this opportunity, they leave the unemployment works in no better condition than they commenced, and drift back again as the casual labourer to the Employment Exchange. If it could be arranged by some means that in future the major portion of the unemployed be recruited from married men who, bv that time, have either learned a trade or are casual labourers for all time coming, and the youth between 17 and 23. instead of being placed on unskilled unemployment work, be given an opportunity of a technical training in some branch of industry or agriculture, they would, at the end of their training, at least have learned a trade, and would be in the position of being ready for absorption as and when industry improved. If industry did not absorb him in this country, he would at least have the opportunity of going abroad into the Colonies with a trade at his finger ends.(iii.) Memorandum (on Betterment) by Inland Revenue Department.1. The &quot; betterment &quot; proposals contained in the pamphlet &quot; We can Conquer Unemployment &quot; are to the effect that &quot; the increasing capital values .... should be appropriated under suitable &apos; betterment &apos; legislation &apos;&apos; presumably some scheme of legislation under which the whole or part of the increased values of the lands in the neighbourhood of the proposed new roads, in so far as such increase is due to their construction, would be secured to the State. There is no scheme of a better-ment tax in the pamphlet, and it is impossible effectively to examine the proposal in the absence of any information as to the form any such scheme would take, e.g., whether the tax is to be levied once and for all or annually; the times at which the &quot; betterment &quot; is to be measured; the occasions on which the tax thereon is to be charged; the amount which it is desired to raise, &amp;c.2. In these circumstances, the Board&apos;s observations upon the subject can only be quite general and directed to the idea of a tax on &quot; betterment &quot; as an abstract proposition.
3. As a preliminary, however, it may be of assistance to indicate briefly what steps have already been taken in this country to secure for the community a share of &quot; betterment,&quot; and certain proposals which have been made on the subject.The term &quot; betterment &quot; is used throughout this Note as meaning the increased value of land which is due to a particular improvement undertaken by the State or a local authority.4. Apart from the Increment Value Duty, there has been no general tax in this country designed to secure to the State some portion of the increasing value of land. That duty, which was repealed in 1920 in circumstances which it is unnecessary to set out in this Note, was designed to secure for the State a share in the increased value of land in general. From time to time, however, legislative provision has been made for securing either to the State or to local authorities a share of any increased value of land which is due to improvements made or action taken by the State or local authorities. The methods by which it has been sought to secure to the State or local authority a share of the increased value (&quot;betterment&quot;) of lands affected by the construction of roads fall within three clearly defined categories.5. Under these provisions a share in &quot;betterment &quot; is secured by one of the following methods : (i.) By a general levy upon all persons whose lands are increased in value by a road scheme.This method is one which is recognised by statute in the case of roads constructed under the powers of the Town Planning Acts. Power is given to the local authority constructing the road to levy a charge of 50 per cent, of the increased value of any lands shown to be benefited, whether adjacent to the road or not. These powers have not, so far as the Board are aware, been actually employed in any case. Very few town-planning schemes have yet arrived at a stage at which the powers become effective. But it is understood that serious difficulties in regard to valuation, such as are indicated in paragraphs 9 and 10 below, may be anticipated in administering the provisions.(ii.) By the increased value of adjoining lands of the same owner being set off against compensation otherwise payable (as in the case of roads constructed or improved under the Development Act, 1909; the Public Health Act, 1925; the Road Improvements Act, 1925).This method has been extensively employed and the cost of acquiring land for road schemes has been materially reduced by taking the benefit conferred by the road on the adjoining lands into account in assessing the purchase price or compensation payable. This method is, however, in effect limited to securing the enhancement of value only up to the amount of the compensation that would otherwise be payable to each individual claimant, and does not extend at all to the enhanced value of the land of anyone whose land is not acquired.(iii.) By the purchase and resale of lands beyond those required for the road construction (as in the case of roads constructed by the Ministry of Transport under the Development Act, 1909); power being given to the Ministry of Transport to acquire compulsorily land within a certain distance from the road at its value at the time the road is begun.This method involves the State in a speculative acquisition of land, and does not simply take from the existing owner a portion or the whole of the increased value of his land.6. Apart from the actual provisions on the statute book to which reference has been made in the preceding paragraph, proposals for securing to the State or Local Authorities a share in any increased value of land due to a particular improvement made by those bodies were contained in Section III of the Second Report of the Acquisition and Valuation of Land Committee, published in 1918 (Cd. 9229). Those proposals were general in their scope, and were not specifically limited to &quot;betterment&quot; arising upon the construction or improvement of roads. They are set out fully in the Report and need not be recapitulated here, beyond saying that they contemplate two valuations of the land affected by the improvement a valuation
before the improvement is effected and a valuation when an estimate can be made of the enhanced value created by the improvement. The excess of the latter value over the former is the &quot;betterment,&quot; of which it was proposed 50 per cent, should be appropriated by the State or Local Authority.7. As indicated in an earlier paragraph in this Note, it is not possible effectively to criticise the proposals in the pamphlet without knowing in detail what form the scheme of &quot;betterment&quot; taxation is intended to take. Certain general points, however, stand out as being common to any form of &quot;betterment&quot; taxation, and certain general observations may be made upon the proposal in itself, which may be regarded as applicable to any scheme of this kind.8. In the first place, it may be admitted that the principle of appropriating at least some portion of &apos;&apos; betterment&apos;&apos; to the authority carrying out the improvement which enhances the value of the lands adjoining is now generally accepted as fair and just, and as involving no undue burden or hardship upon the fortunate owner of the land, the value of which has been increased by no action of his own. It may, therefore, be anticipated that the administration of a &quot;betterment&quot; tax would not meet with the organised opposition which led in the end to the abandonment of the Land Values Duties of 1909.9. Secondly, it is an inherent feature of &quot;betterment&quot; taxation that it involves, in the case of any unit of land in single ownership within the area affected by the improvement, two or more valuations; and if the &apos;&apos; betterment&quot; is to be restricted solely to the enhanced value due to the improvement, a dissection of the valuation.It is here that the main difficulty of such taxation will arise. There can be no certain guide as to what proportion of any enhancement of the value of land is due to any one cause whether, for instance, to the construction of a road or to the natural growth of the population in the locality, or to other factors. Valuation is not an exact science, and the ascertainment of the causes to which any enhanced value is due presents a fruitful field for disputes. The longer the period which elapses between the commencement of a road scheme and the date at- which the enhanced value of the land due to that scheme is to be ascertained, the more the difficulty of isolating the value due to the scheme will become accentuated.10. Apart from the difficulty mentioned in the preceding paragraph, other difficulties though not of a very serious or insoluble kind may be anticipated in connection with ascertaining the area within which &apos;&apos; betterment&apos;&apos; arising from an improvement is to be found; in the apportionment of the tax between different persons interested in the land; and in the collection of the tax, unless it is to be paid only on the occasion of the realisation of the &quot;betterment&quot; on sale or otherwise. In fact, many of the difficult problems which arise in connection with the taxation of site values will emerge, though in a minor degree.11. With regard to the money to be collected under a &quot;betterment&quot; tax, no estimate can be given which would have any value at all. What enhancement of value of land adjoining any new road is due to the construction of the road can only be determined &quot;upon an examination of the land itself and all the factors influencing values in the neighbourhood. While the construction of a new road may cause a large increase in the value of the adjoining land in the neighbourhood of a large town, it must be borne in mind that the proposed roads extend all over England and Scotland, and that in large areas through which they pass there will be little or no immediate increase in value of the adjoining lands due to their construction. Indeed, it may well be that in certain areas (e.g., in the case of lands being developed as high-class residential estates and also Highland grouse moors) the construction of a road may decrease the value of the adjoining land.While it might be possible to form some rough-and-ready estimate of the enhanced value of land created by (say) the construction of the Kingston By-Pass and of the area affected by such enhancement of value, any conclusions drawn from their ratio to the cost of that road would have no value whatever if applied to other proposed roads, particularly when it is remembered that it is only the terminating points of the proposed roads which are indicated, and no attempt has been made to map out the precise courses which those roads are to take between the terminating points.
12. The determination of the &quot;betterment&quot; would, it is presumed, fall to be undertaken by the Valuation Office of the Inland Revenue. Without knowing precisely what is contemplated in the scheme of &quot;betterment&quot; taxation, it is not possible to estimate what additional staff would be required for the work. But if all the proposed roads are to be completed in two years and all the adjoining land valued in that time and the &quot; betterment &quot; ascertained, it may safely be said that the staff of that office would at least have to be doubled* for that period.As regards the administration and collection of the tax itself, it would no doubt be a matter for consideration whether this should be entrusted to the Inland Revenue or to the Government Department which was responsible for the construction of the roads. But if this were regarded as appropriate to the Inland Revenue, it would not appear that any large additional staff would be required for this purpose.1. The erection of houses is looked at in the pamphlet as a relief measure for the provision of employment, and housing schemes are treated as primarily representing one of the factors in building up a total volume of employment.This method of approach is diametrically opposed to that adopted by the Depart-ment, which has regarded as of primary importance (a.) The re-establishment of housing as a productive industry with a view to enabling it to provide houses for the working classes on an economic basis as soon as possible.(b.) The necessity for ensuring in the meantime a building programme adequate to meet the needs of the homeless and the badly housed.It is suggested, therefore, that the pamphlets method of approach to the social problem is mistaken, but for the purpose of examining the proposals it will be necessary to use the same approach and simply to consider how far the statements of fact and the suggestions and criticisms made in it call for comment.2.   The pamphlet contains a number of points :  (a.) A statement as to the amount of unemployment in the building trade andthe State&apos;s responsibility for its existence. (b.) An estimate of the need for houses in the country.(c.) A  dissertation on the most important aspects  of the housing need.particularly of the need for lower rented nouses. (d.) Some reference to the forms of assistance suggested.(e.) Recommendations in favour of the reconditioning of houses and the erection of fiats in London.(/.) A criticism of recent policy in regard to subsidy, particularly as to its alleged effect on the production of houses and on unemployment, and the supposed breach of faith with the building industry.(g.) Conclusions as to the extent of the immediate building programme and the additional number of men for whom employment can be found by the adoption of such a programme.3. As the need for houses must ultimately be a determining factor in the extent to which a building programme should be continued, the manner in which this question is handled in the pamphlet may conveniently be dealt with first.The estimate of 709,000 as the number necessary to abate overcrowding is simply the arithmetical figure derived from the census returns for 1921 as necessary to give one dwelling to each family.The census figures were Chapter IY. Housing.    (Section III of Pamphlet.)(i.) Memorandum by Ministry of Health.N umber of structurally separate dwellings occupied Number of structurally separate dwellings unoccupied ..7,811,030 218,833Total8,029,863 8.739,197Number of familiesDeficit       ... ... ...* Note. The Office at present employs 320 value is aiirl 430 clerical staff.709,339
4. This figure is not, however, in itself any evidence of the effective demand for houses, which depends on a number of considerations other than the purely arithmetical. The survey made in 1919, which was based on the information in the possession of Local Authorities as to their local conditions, put the need due to overcrowding and necessary to provide for the growth of population up to 1922 at 506,700. This figure, allowing for the pamphlefs annual allowance of 100,000 for the extra year covered by this estimate, would result in a figure of 406,700 to compare with that of 709,000 mentioned in the pamphlet as the need in 1921.Experience indicated, however, that these figures were very unreliable : the standards adopted by individual Local Authorities varied considerably and the marked changes in local conditions during the intervening years have made the results of the survey inapplicable to present conditions.The idea of postulating a figure of total need arrived at on an arithmetical basis at a particular point of time as the starting point for a building programme over a period of years is in itself a fallacious guide to the effective demand for houses. It is not really possible to say more with accuracy than that there does still exist a real need and an effective demand sufficient to justify a continuance of substantial building programmes for some time to come. The question how the present sufficiency of houses compares with the position in 1921 is capable of more exact calculation by reference to the number of houses built in the meantime, and is dealt with later as belonging more conveniently to the criticism of recent housing policy.Having taken a present figure of 375,000 as the estimate of need due to over-crowding, the pamphlet proceeds to add to this figure (a) 500,000 to replace definitely slum dwellings of the lowest standard;(b) millions of houses which are altogether unsatisfactory.There is no evidence quoted in the pamphlet or in our possesion to support these figures : with (b) in the programme, the difference between 375,000 and 500,000 becomes of little moment. It is possible, on the other hand, that (&amp;) may be a figure based not on evidence but merely thrown in to support the idea that, to justify the main thesis, there must be a need for a continued programme of 200,000 houses a year for a long period after the two years which would absorb the need based on some evidence.The only figures available as to the extent of unsatisfactory houses were those contained in the survey of 1919, which showed the following :  Houses included in unhealthy areas        ... ...        80,800Other unfit houses        ... ... ... ...       115,700Houses falling below a reasonable standard of fitness      113,200309,700It would be unwise to attach too much importance to these figures for the estimates in individual districts vary substantially according to the standards adopted, but such a figure, which was made by the individual authority to the best of its ability, is undoubtedly nearer to the mark than the unspecified number of millions mentioned in the pamphlet : moreover, it will be appreciated that a proportion of these houses will be capable of being reconditioned as recommended in the pamphlet, and to that extent the need for new construction will be diminished.5. Passing from the question of the arithmetical need to that of the actual demand for houses, the pamphlet states shortly (1.) That the demand for houses over  500 in selling price, or over 15s. a week in gross rent, has been largely met. (2.) That there is a big demand for houses at a gross rent of from 10s. to 15s.per week.(3.) That there is an immense need for still cheaper houses for the unskilled worker with young children and for the slum dweller.6. Not much criticism can be made of this statement of the present position. The action to be taken to deal with the position is not, however, so clearly stated.(i.) Presumably, by inference, it is not intended that subsidies should be available for houses to be sold at more than  500 or let at more than 15s. a week gross rent.This is very substantially what is to happen in any case, as the subsidy provided by the Act of 1923 ceases, except for houses finished by the 30th September this year,. [19066] E
and Local Authorities building under the Act of 1924 are already concentrating their efforts on the erection of houses to meet the needs of the poorer workers.It should, however, be noted that this does not mean that houses selling at  500 or over are not and will not be provided, but that, as a result of the policy of reviving the building industry, this type of house can now be provided without assistance.(ii.) It is suggested that the existing subsidy should be retained to provide houses at the lowest rents possible, apparently round about 10.9. a week gross. The pamphlet seems to contemplate the maintenance of a subsidy fixed at the same rate till the end &quot; of the 15-year period; the policy actually followed aims at securing a continued supply of nouses of the same type and same level of rents by facilitating the reduction of building costs, a matter to which the pamphlet makes no reference at all. This question is dealt with in more detail later on.(iii.) It is suggested that the provision of urban houses at less than 10s. per week gross rental for the unskilled worker with a large family should be begun at once, and that such subsidies should be paid as are necessary, with special consideration to those with large families..   It is not clear whether this is to be effected by (a) a larger subsidy on the house let to a tenant of certain wages or with a certainnumber of children, or (6) by a system of family allowances.The latter would inevitably have to apply generally and not to tenants of municipal houses, and does not therefore call for comment in connection with housing.As regards the former, it is possible, as matters stand, for Local Authorities to charge varying rents to different classes, and under this head to charge lower rents to tenants with larger families. This is what is being done at Welwyn in the instance quoted in the pamphlet.7.   There are also a few recommendations on subsidiary points :  (i.) Larger subsidies for rural districts.  These are already payable, the subsidy in agricultural parishes being  3 10s. a year for forty years in excess of that payable elsewhere; (ii.) The reconditioning of existing houses, for which proper State assistance should be forthcoming.The Government have already announced their intention to introduce legislation to deal comprehensively with the whole question of the slums, and it has been made clear that the question of reconditioning houses will be included.(iii.) A recommendation in favour of the erection of blocks of flats on modern and attractive lines, particularly in London.The London County Council made special representations some months ago with regard to the special needs in connection with the provision of accommodation in the central areas.8. No mention is made in the pamphlet &quot;of any policy of slum clearance, which would raise the very difficult questions arising out of compensation for shun properties acquired under such schemes.9.   The criticism of recent policy is contained in the following sentences : (1.) Its contribution to the housing problem has consisted in a cut in the housing subsidy in September 1927, and the promise of additional cuts in September 1929.(2.) The proximate cause of the large increase in unemployment in the Building Industry was the decision to reduce the housing subsidy as from September 1927.10. Dealing with the first point, the natural method for testing the accuracy of the statement is an examination of the actual building progress during recent years in relation to the current needs and accumulated arrears. The pamphlet itself states that in 1921 the need for houses was 709,000, that in July 1929 this was reduced to 375,000, and that the number required annually to meet the normal growth of families and the wastage of houses from old age is 100,000 per annum. Between 1921 and 1929, therefore, according to the pamphlet, the current needs were met and the accumulated arrears were reduced by 334,000. During the years 1921-24 inclusive the number of houses built was 401,366, i.e., almost exactly the current needs, but with nothing to wipe off the accumulated arrears.   During the
years 1925-28 inclusive the number of houses built was 804,401, i.e., enough to meet the current needs and to wipe off 400,000 of the accumulated arrears, a figure not much at variance with the figure of 334,000 assumed in the pamphlet. A further four years&apos; progress equal to that effected during the last four years would, therefore, wipe out the whole of the need according to the estimate made in the pamphlet.It is suggested, therefore, that the pamphlet has produced figures which are entirely inconsistent with its statement of the State&apos;s contribution in regard to housing policy.11. At this stage it is perhaps convenient to consider the Departments policy in regard to housing subsidies in comparison with that suggested in the pamphlet, so far as the latter is ascertainable.The Department have always made it clear (a) that it was their intention to get rid of subsidies at the earliest possible moment. In pursuance of this policy a reduction of  25 per house was made in September 1927, and a further reduction of  25 will be made in September 1929, on subsidies payable under the Act of 1924, and of  50 under the Act of 1923, thus bringing the latter subsidy to an end.(b) that it was their intention to carry out this policy in such a way as not tointerfere with the maintenance of adequate programmes of house building. Following the reduction of subsidy in 1927, the number of subsidy houses built in 1928 was 104,335, which, with 64,624 non-subsidy houses, not merely provided for current needs, but provided also a substantial contribution towards arrears.(c) that the revival of the building industry and the erection of working-classhouses by private enterprise was a primary object. During the last four years 804,401 houses have been provided, 530,344 of which have been provided by private enterprise.(d) that Local Authorities should concentrate their efforts on the erection ofhouses which could be let at rents within the means of the less well paid workers.(e) that the reduction of subsidies would be followed by a reduction in building-costs, and that it is to such a reduction that they look to enable both private enterprise and local authorities to provide houses at rents suitable for the needs of the persons for whom they are catering.12. At the time when the intention to reduce the subsidy was announced in October 1926, the average price of the non-parlour house was  451; in September 1927, when the cut took effect, it had fallen to  403; in September 1928, when the question of reviewing the subsidy fell again to be considered, it had fallen to  360, and the figure for the month of February was  344. The total fall in building costs has therefore been  107; the equivalent of the cut in subsidy (allowing for the appropriate reduction in the contribution to be made from the rates also) was  37 10s. in September 1927, and will be a further  37 10s. in September 1929 for houses built under the Act of 1924, so that after the next cut Local Authorities will be  32 per house better off than they were before the first cut was made, and this saving is in itself equivalent to a reduction of about Is. a week in the rents of the houses, and should, therefore, be of material assistance in facilitating the provision of low-rented houses.The pamphlet does not make any specific proposals in regard to subsidies, and it appears to attach no importance to the question of building costs in relation to either subsidies or rents. It contents itself with saying that the present subsidies should be continued, and that larger ones should be given in certain cases, without suggesting how the benefit of this subsidy will enure to the tenant and not be absorbed en route. It does not express any opinion whether houses ought to be provided by Local Authorities or by private enterprise, or by both agencies, and it does not show any appreciation of the building industry as a productive organisation.13. The question of the State&apos;s responsibility for producing an increased amount of unemployment in the building trade is so closely connected with the other allegation as to the effect of the arrangements with the building industry in 1924, and with the actual facts as to the extent of the unemployment and the degree to which it is affected by housing at all, that it will be convenient to consider these points together.
The pamphlet states that the British people, through Parliament, are under an -honourable pledge to the Building Industry; that in 1924 the State made a bargain with the Building Trade that, in return for the industry agreeing to augment their resources up to a capacity of 225,000 houses per annum, the subsidy should be continued for 15 years, and two and a half million houses should be built in that period.The statement that the subsidy should be continued for fifteen years suggests the maintenance of a fixed subsidy and is at variance with the Act of 1924 itself, which contains in Sections 4 and 5 provisions for the abolition of the subsidy in certain conditions and for its review every two years. The action taken in reducing the subsidy is in accordance with the provisions of the statute.14. The next statement is as to the erection of 2\ million houses before 1939. In CD. 2151 it is stated that &quot; the object of the proposals for which Exchequer provision is sought, is the completion of approximately 2,500,000 houses of the type required in 15 years.&quot; The calculations then made appear to have been based on the assumption that all houses would be built under the Act of 1924.But the discussions with the building industry were directed to ensuring that, if the building industry expanded their organisation, there would be assurance of a house building programme till 1939. From the point of view of the building industry, it does not matter whether these houses are provided under the Act of 1924 or not, and it would be wrong to suggest that because the erection of houses by private enterprise has revived in a manner not contemplated by the promoters of the Act of 1924, the work which is found by this agency in the erection of houses should be left out of account in calculating the employment found for the building industry on housing.15. The programme laid down in CD. 2151 for the years 1925-28 was as follows : 1925 ... ... ... ... 90,0001926 ... ... ... ... 100,0001927 ... ... ... ... 110,0001928 ... ... ... ... 120,000The number of houses actually built in these years has been as follows :  1925 ... ... ... ... 166,2321926 ... ... ... ... 210,3081927 ... ... ... ... 276,9021928 ... ... ... ... 168,959Thus during the first four years of the period the number of houses provided was double that contemplated by the programme, and in three years a point has been reached far bejrond the peak previously regarded as the limit of possibility in nine years.16. It may incidentally be added that for the 420,000 houses to be provided before the end of 1928 the charge on the Exchequer as estimated in 1924 was  3,827,000. For the 800,000 houses which have actually been provided the actual charge on the Exchequer will be about  3,750,000. The State has therefore provided a programme of house building twice as large as that contemplated under the Act of 1924 at about the same cost.17. It will, however, be necessary to deal with the question of the actual amount of employment and unemployment in the building trade.The pamphlet states that &apos;&apos; there are more persons at present unemployed in the Building Industry than in any other British industry, except coal-mining, and the proximate cause of the large increase in unemployment is the Governments decision to reduce subsidy.The first statement is not untrue in words. It is, however, only made true because the pamphlet does not allow for the seasonal character of the building trade, and it will be appreciated that the normal increase in the winter months has been intensified this year by the abnormally severe weather. The actual percentage of unemployment in the building trade as a whole was 19-9 in January 1929; as a matter of percentage this compares favourably with 31-2 per cent, among dock and riverside labourers, 28-6 in shipbuilding, 20-2 in the iron and steel industries, and the number of men employed in these industries is not so large as in the building
industry. Further, the percentage of unemployment in the building industry is weighted to a considerable extent by percentages of 33-7 among painters and 21 among labourers, two of the largest arms in the building industry, but not the most essential in house building.If the pamphlet had taken the position prevailing in the building industry at a season when building is normally active, it would have been found that the percentage of unemployment in the building industry in June 1928 was 9-3, and that out of 16 main industries of which particulars are given in the Ministry of Labour Gazette, the percentage of unemployment in the building industry was the lowest but two.The normal figure is no doubt something between the two, but it is suggested that it is wrong to take the figures for a particular month, and that an abnormally severe January, and use these figures as a main foundation for a long-term scheme of employment in the building trade.18. It is perhaps equally, if not more relevant, to consider what has been done in promoting and maintaining the supply of employment in the building industry, and thus giving effect to the understanding on which the building industry augmented its numbers. It must, however, be premised that housing is only one element in the building industry, and that an increase or decrease in other forms of building not controlled by the State is almost as potent a factor in its effect on employment as the housing programme.The Committee of the Building Industry calculated in 1924 that for an additional programme of 50,000 houses it would be necessary to increase the number of men employed on building houses by 59,838, comprising 34,338 skilled and 25,500 unskilled, as follows : BricklayersCarpenters and joinersSlaters, tilers and plasterersMasons, pointers, plumbers and gasfittersLabourers11,772 7,848 7,848 6,87025,50059,838The actual number of men employed in June 1924 in the classes in question was :-BricklayersCarpenters and joiners ... Slaters, tilers and plasterers Masons, painters and plumbers Labourers53,157 104,85716,448 133,901 211,452519,815The number of houses completed during 1924 was 163,762. The number of houses completed during 1927 was 256,302. On the basis adopted in 1924 for the augmenta-tion of the building industry, the personnel ought, if the basis were correct and housing were the sole factor in the building industry, to have been increased by approximately 100,000. The actual number of men employed in June 1927 in the classes in question was : Bricklayers      ...          ... ... ... 67,351Carpenters and joiners ... ... ... 106,887Slaters, tilers and plasterers ... ... 19,559Masons, painters and plumbers ... ... 137,684Labourers       ...         ... ... ... 208,731540,212The actual increase was, therefore, only 20,000, and it appears clear, therefore, that either there was a marked improvement in the organisation of the building industry (a process which it is assumed the writers of the pamphlet would not wish to criticise) or that the volume of employment to be found in the building industry is dependent very largely on the extent of building other than housing.
19. Taking the arms of the trade which are peculiarly associated with house-building, it may be pointed out that, while the number of bricklayers reached a peak of 67,351 in June 1927 and has somewhat fallen since that time, the number employed in January 1929 (the worst month of the year, and a very severe January at that) was 58,568, a figure which is 5,000 higher than that reached in the summer of 1925 and within a few hundreds of the figure for June 1926. Incidentally, as illustrating the relation of house-building to other building, it may be pointed out that in the year 1913, when only 59,312 houses were built, there were 68,920 brick-layers employed, while in 1927 the number of houses built was 256,302 and the number of bricklayers employed was 67,351.Similarly, in regard to slaters, tilers and plasterers, the numbers employed in the three years in question in relation to the number of houses built was : 20. It is suggested from consideration of these figures that the conclusion in the pamphlet that an artificial increase in the State-aided housing programme by 35,000 houses a year would automatically be followed by an increase in the number of men for whom employment would be found in the building industry by 35,000 is quite erroneous. Moreover, it will be appreciated that it is not sufficient to announce an increased building programme. Such an announcement indicates the view either that Local Authorities are failing in their duties or that the assistance given to them is inadequate. The adoption of the former view leads the way to a policy of attempted coercion which was tried with marked lack of success in the days of the Addison scheme, and is completely at variance with the policy of co-operation and local autonomy now in force. The adoption of the latter course runs the risk (which past history shows to be a practical certainty) of increasing building prices, a con-contingency which the pamphlet ignores.21. To sum up, the real question is not whether an extra 35,000 houses can, as a mere physical undertaking, be promised in the year of the general election. The Department have been engaged on a consistent policy which has produced houses in unprecedented numbers and is gradually but surely bringing back the erection of houses to an economic basis, and relieving Local Authorities of the heaviest portion of their burdens in regard to capital expenditure and annual deficit.The view that this represents the right course to pursue is widely held. Sir John Tudor Walters, who has played an important part both in advising on housing and in executing housing schemes, expressed his considered views recently in the following terms :  &quot; I am not a believer in the permanence of the subsidy in any form for houses of that description. My experience of building in the last six years has ; shown me clearly that, given any reasonable condition of the money market, any reasonable economy in the rating expenditure, and effective co-operation between masters and men in the building trade which would, without reducing wages, considerably increase the output given those three conditions, we ought to be able to build ordinary working-class dwellings by private enterprise, as well as through local authorities, and let them at an economic rent that the working-classes can afford to pay. I think it should be our aim and our determination to try to secure those results. I should like to see great organisations of employers on the lines of the Industrial Housing Association providing houses for their workpeople. I should like to see a further extension of the methods of building-societies and a large extension of the ownership of houses by working men themselves. In that direction I think most useful work could be done for the benefit of the community and for the economic stability of the State. So I should like to get rid of that problem, and I should like to take it away in the process of time from the sphere of local authority enterprise. I should like the local authorities to be relieved of that burden.&quot;22. The pamphlet, on the other hand, makes no attempt to grapple with the economic or financial aspects of the housing question; it appears to be content to assume that the erection of houses will continue to be uneconomic, and that itsNumberNumber of Houses Built.Employed1913   ... 1924, June 1927, June 1929, January26,830 16,448 19,559 18,57859,312 163,762 256.302
uneconomic aspect is its most stable factor; it displays no interest in the cost of&apos; house building or m the relation of subsidies to that cost, and does not indicate by what methods the increased programme which it advocates is to be carried out.   Inmany aspects, it bears a marked resemblance to the policy adopted in 1919_in itspaper programme, without consideration of financial or administrative difficulties. It will be remembered that after the previous scheme had been in operation for two years, the price of houses had risen to such a height that the building programme had to be drastically curtailed and the scheme brought to an end. Such rapid fluctuations of policy result only in dislocation of the industry, and grave dissatisfaction among- the Local Authorities. It is only by the ordered progress of recent years that these obstacles have been overcome.(ii.) Memorandum by Department of Health [Scotland).1. The observations of the Department deal more especially with the portion of Section III dealing with &quot; Housing in Scotland.&quot; Certain general remarks are, however, submitted after the Scottish position is discussed. The following observa-tions follow the order of the points raised in the pamphlet : 2. Rate of Building in Scotland.The statement here is that house building in Scotland proceeds at a much slower rate than in England and Wales. This would appear to be the case. Statistics which are available for 1927 and 1928 seem to indicate that, while in Scotland the number of houses completed in these years is roughly equivalent to the number under construction at the commencement of the year, in England the number completed during the year far exceeds the number under construction at the beginning of the year. This would seem to indicate that a larger and more continuous head of labour is employed in housing schemes in England than in Scotland. As stated in the Report of the Scottish Board of Health for 1927, the number of persons, including unskilled workers, engaged per house on the schemes of Local Authorities was approximately 0-7.3. Reasons for Slower Rate.The reference to much more substantial houses being provided in Scotland to meet climatic conditions, is presumably to the different type of roof construction adopted, but it is understood that, in point of time occupied in construction, there is little, if any, difference between the two methods. The Scottish houses have, however, a higher plumbing standard, and more time may be occupied on this work.It is by no means clear that the stoppages of work on house-building in Scotland owing to frost and other bad weather are more frequent than in&quot; England. The Ministry of Labour may, however, have some statistics which would show whether this is so -Other reasons might, however, be put forward why building is slower in Scotland. Prior to the post-war schemes, Scotland was largely a stone-built country; these schemes are largely brick built, and it is not unlikely that the Scottish bricklayer may not yet be so expeditious at this work as his English brother.In England, too, it is understood there are many large firms who specialise in house-building and can tackle big schemes. In Scotland the number of such firms is small, and the Scottish practice of contracting for each separate trade with a separate firm may have a dragging effect on building operations. The smaller contractor may work largely with his own men and be unwilling to engage many extra men for a housing scheme, thus retarding its progress.Another cause of slower progress may be that level sites for building are more difficult to obtain in Scotland, resulting in more time being required in preparing lay-outs of sites, and in necessary excavation and underbuilding.4. Possibility of a Reduction of Subsidy as a Deterrent against Building.The time within which a contract can be completed should be fairly easily estimated, having regard to the experience of building that most Local Authorities have now had, and it is not clear, therefore, that the statement is correct that the possibility of a reduction in subsidy at a future date has acted, as a much greater
deterrent against building than in England and Wales. Naturally Local Authorities tend to slow up with schemes when the revision period is approaching. This will apply in both countries, but the Scottish Local Authorities are favourably placed in that, by the extension of the original subsidy period by two years over England, they know what the reduction has been in England, and may, therefore, form an idea as to the probable subsidy in Scotland after the next revision period5. Contribution of Scottish Local Authorities to Annual Loss.Reference is here made to the greater poverty of many of the Scottish areas. When the 1923 and 1924 Acts were under consideration, enquiry was made as to a possible scheme of differentiation of subsidy among different Local Authorities, but no practicable scheme could be evolved. A standard of poverty could not be arrived at high rates might mean low rents and low rates might mean high rents. Accordingly, the flat rate subsidy was decided on. It was, however, agreed that so far as the Highland Counties were concerned the larger subsidy under the 1924 Act available for rural areas as defined in that Act would be available to these Highland County Local Authorities whether or not they complied with the definition of &quot; rural area &quot; in the Act.It has to be kept in mind, too, that in many so-called poor burghs the average rental per house in low. The result is that what may seem a high rate that may be required to be imposed for housing means little additional by way of actual rates. e.g., a rate of 6d. (i.e., 3d. on owners and 3d. on occupiers) on an average rental of  12 means only 3s. per annum additional by way of rates to be paid by owner and occupier.Returns received by the Department of Health for Scotland show that many Scottish Local Authorities contribute substantially more than the  4 10s. provided for in the Act, In some cases it would seem that the contribution is even more than  14.6. Scotland&apos;s Share of Housing Grants.This paragraph refers to Scotland&apos;s share of grants as being usually ll/80ths of England, and alleges that Scotland has so far received only 62 per cent, of that proportion.It should be pointed out that the housing grants are not distributed on this basis. In none of the schemes is Scotland restricted to ll/80ths of England&apos;s share. If it could have been possible to have built as many houses as England, the necessary grant would have been received. When the cut came in 1921, the Treasury, in view of the special position in Scotland, agreed to allocate an additional 3,801 houses to Scottish Local Authorities to be built under that scheme. 25,550 houses have been built under that scheme in Scotland as against 174,603 in England.According to the Ministry of Health Report for 1927-28, the total payments of Exchequer subsidy in respect of housing to the 31st March, 1928, were (exclusive of a payment of  20,000 towards cottages for tuberculous ex-Service men)  63,514,657. Eleven-eightieths of this would be  8,733,265. In Scotland the payments to the same date (including a sum of  1,019,688 paid to the Second Scottish National Housing Company in respect of the capital cost of the Government scheme of steel houses) was  7,923,424. Scotland to that date was, therefore, on an ll/80ths basis, nearly  810,000 short. This does not bear out the statement in the pamphlet that Scotland has received only 62 per cent, of an ll/80ths share of England. That percentage would represent  5,414,624, whereas, as stated, Scotland has up to the 31st March, 1928, received  7,923,424, or over 90 per cent.7. Scotland&apos;s deficiency is principally accounted for by the much greater advantage that was taken in England of the lump-sum subsidy paid by the State to private enterprise under the Housing (Additional Powers) Act, 1919. In England no less a sum than  9,493,155 was paid under that Act, whereas in Scotland only  550,296 was paid. If these sums are deducted from the total figures given above, it will be found that to the 31st March, 1928, the total English payments of housing subsidy had been  54,012,502 and the Scottish payments  7,373,128. Eleven-eightieths of the English sum is  7,427,956 so that on this basis Scotland is still short by only about  55,000.The Ministry of Health Estimate for housing grants for the year 1928-29 is  10,665,000.   Eleven-eightieths of this sum is  1,466,437.   The Scottish Estimate
for the same year is  1,433,774. The Scottish Estimate for 1929-30 is  1,624,718 as against the English Estimate of  11,150,000. Eleven-eightieths of this is  1,535,125; so that, on this estimate, Scotland is the gainer. Whether or not this will be so cannot be determined until the actual expenditure for the year is known, but it may be that, in view of the two years&apos; extension of subsidy rates given to Scotland as&quot;compared with England, the actual payments in Scotland for the years 192S-29 and 1929-30, when known, may approach very closely, if not exceed, the ll/S0ths of Engiand&apos;s payments. This again indicates that the loss to Scotland on the ll/80ths basis would appear to be almost entirely due to the failure of private enterprise to take full advantage of the 1919 Additional Powers Act lump sum subsidy.S. Mention might be made in connection with the plea that Scotland should receive ll/80ths of England&apos;s grants that, in some housing grants, e.g., Slum Clearance and Rural Workers&apos; Housing, Scotland appears to be receiving actually more grant than England. As regards the former grant, there had been completed at the 31st December last in Scotland, with the aid of that assistance, 8,688 houses, representing, on the basis of 4 persons per house, the rehousing of a population of nearly 35,000 persons. According to an answer reported in Hansard for the 14th March, 1929, col. 1262, rehousing accommodation in England would appear to have been provided, up to the 31st December, 1928, for only 6,994 persons.Under the Housing (Rural Workers) Act, applications for assistance had been approved in Scotland at the 31st December, 1928, covering 1,396 houses as against 1,316 in England; the work on 658 had been finished in Scotland as against 626 in England.An examination of the available statistics seems to indicate that, under the 1924 Act scheme of assistance also, Scotland may be receiving more than its 11 /SOths share. In England it would seem that 156,190 houses were completed under that Act at the 30th September, 1927, and 66,453 since that date to the 31st December, 1928. The total subsidy for these houses at  9 and  7 10s. respectively (ignoring the extra sum payable in agricultural parishes) is  1,904,107 10s. Eleven-eightieths of this is  261,814. To the 31st December, 1928, there have been completed in Scotland, under the 1924 Act, 30,338 houses. At  9 per house the subsidy will be  273,042, more than the ll/80ths share above calculated.9. Special Assistance to Scotland.The housing conditions in Scotland have received special attention. An offer of an additional grant was made to Local Authorities who undertook the erection of houses in special forms of construction. This offer not being acceptable, the State itself, through the Second Scottish National Housing Company, has provided in Scotland 2,552 houses of the steel type at a cost estimated at nearly  1,275,000. No part of such cost is borne by the ratepayers, but the payments made to the Housing-Company by the State under this scheme are included in the total payments of grant to the 31st March, 1928, referred to above.As noted in the following paragraph, Scotland has obtained a two years&apos; extension over England in the matter of the 1923 and 1924 Act subsidies. It might also be noted that a considerable number of the houses provided at Rosyth for Admiralty workers have, in consequence of the reduction of staff at the Naval Base, been made available for persons in Dunfermline, Edinburgh and elsewhere desiring-houses, thus reducing the housing pressure in these areas.10.   Suggested Extension of Time for Completion of Scottish Schemes.It is suggested in the pamphlet that there should be some provision for an extension of time within which approved housing schemes in Scotland can be completed. This has already been granted. The first revision of subsidy provided for under the Act of 1924 took place after October 1926. The English subsidy was then reduced in respect of houses completed after the 30th September, 1927 no-reduction was made in Scotland. The next revision took place after October 1928. The English subsidy was again reduced in respect of houses completed after the 30th September, 1929, but the Scottish subsidy was reduced in respect of houses completed after that date only to the amount of the previous English reduction. Scotland, therefore, has obtained a two years&apos; extension over England.

Unemployment.The pamphlet states that the housing problem is considered primarily from the unemployment point of view. It is stated that at December 1928 there were 75,000 building trade operatives insured; that 9,000 were then engaged on house-building, and 11,800 or 15-7 per cent, were unemployed.The figure of 75,000 building trade operatives insured is in accord with Ministry of Labour statistics. It is understood, however, that this figure includes numbers of persons who cannot be called building trade operatives, e.g., clerks, typists, &amp;c, in builders&apos; offices, mosaic workers, retort builders, &amp;c.As regards the figure of 9,000 operatives engaged on house building, this is not in accord with the Departments information. The only statistics the Department possess are of operatives (including apprentices) on Local Authority Assisted Schemes. The returns for December 1928 showed that there were 9,113 men so engaged; at the same date there were 13,004 houses under such schemes under construction; but at that date there were in addition 3,223 houses under construction by assisted private enterprise. No figures are available as to the number of men employed on these schemes, nor on unassisted private enterprise houses. The number of operatives engaged on house-building would, therefore, be in excess of 9,000.14. The figure of 11,800 persons unemployed in the building industry in December 1928 is approximately correct (the exact figure being 11,787, according to Ministry of Labour returns). But this is a high figure due to the season of the year. In December 1926 the figure was 11,143, in December 1927 it was 11,022. As the building season progresses this number steadily diminishes, as the following table shows : Number Unemployed.May 1926 May 1927 May 1928June 1926 June 1927 June 1928July 1926 July 1927 July 19284,769 6,0667,914 4,917 6,4567,296 5,718 7.104The suggestion that some discretion should be allowed as to the payment of a grant after the expiration of a time-limit would lead to the very greatest difficulty in administration. It might also have the effect of slowing up the activities of Local Authorities.11.   Housing&apos; Shortage.The housing shortage of 100,000 mentioned is not considered an over-estimate; probably it is an under-estimate. It has also to be kept in mind that that estimate is framed on the lower standard of habitation referred to in the Royal Commission&apos;s Report, i.e., permitting one- and two-room houses to remain at present numbers. If the higher standard recommended by the Commission were adopted, the shortage would be considerably increased.12.   Output of Houses.As regards the rate of building, the following Table shows that during the last three years the rate of output of houses has greatly increased : 
Further, an examination of the figures of unemployed in the individual trades making up the total of 11,800 shows that of this total 2,489 are painters, 3,001 are labourers, and 3,334 are subsidiary occupations a total of 8,824. Of the main trades of carpenters, bricklayers, masons, slaters, plasterers and plumbers, there were only 2,963.In thg summer, when the numbers unemployed as shown above are considerably lower, the number of these Key trade men is much less, e.g., in June 1928, when there was a total of 6,456 unemployed, there were only 154 bricklayers, 221 masons, 81 slaters, 62 plasterers, 386 plumbers, and 528 carpenters a total of 1,432.15. The proposal in the pamphlet is to build an additional 5,000 houses per annum, thereby employing 5,000 of the unemployed building trade workers. It is not clear that, with the present supply of labour, this is possible. For the purpose of arriving at what is possible, the figures of unemployment in mid-winter should not be taken. It is suggested that those (say) in October, before winter frosts, &amp;c, come to stop work from time to time, might be taken. No reliable statistics are available as to the number of houses each tradesman could undertake in a year, but, on such information as is available, it would seem that every one of the then unemployed carpenters would be required for the proposed 5,000 houses; 1,000 bricklayers and masons would be required, as against the 588 then unemployed; the slaters would be sufficient; 500 plasterers would be required, as against the 88 unemployed; plumbers would be sufficient. Unless, therefore, bricklayers, masons and plasterers could be drawn from other work, or alternative methods of construction adopted, the programme of 5,000 houses would not seem practicable. Further, these numbers could not be employed immediately, as the carpenters, plasterers, plumbers and slaters could be employed only as and when the other trades had sufficiently advanced the houses for their stage of the work.The number of unemployed plasterers at the date in question was 88. They could, it is estimated, do the plastering work on from 880 to 1,000 houses. Unless, therefore, additional plasterers could be made available or alternative methods used, 1,000 houses would seem to be the most that could be completed, though the number of unemployed in the other trades at the date in question could do their part of the work on a good many more houses, e.g.: Obviously, however, it is not advisable to proceed with more houses than the plasterers could finish, as it is neither economical nor desirable to have large numbers of houses only partially completed.16. So far as the cost to the State of the suggested 5,000 additional houses is concerned, this would, on the basis of a subsidy of  9 per house, be  45,000 per annum for forty years, and on the basis of the reduced subsidy of  7 10s., payable after the 30th September next, it would be  37,500 per annum for a similar period.17. The Shim Problem.So far as the Slum problem is concerned, the eventual solution of this appears ta depend on the rate at which the new houses to rehouse the slum dwellers can be erected. Enquiry has recently been made of the Local Authorities in Scotland, who have carried out Improvement Schemes under Part II of the Housing (Scotland) Act, 1925, whether they can suggest any way by which the statutory procedure could be expedited. The general effect of the replies is that no material hastening of the procedure can be suggested.So far, under the special provisions for Slum Clearance, thirty-eight Local Authorities in Scotland have had proposals approved. These cover 14,221 houses, of which only 156 are to be reconstructed. The remainder are to be demolished. To the 28th February, 9,068 houses had been completed. The houses are as a rule being built on other sites than those previously occupied the latter being cleared and left either as open spaces or being used for purposes other than housing.The rents of the houses in these Slum Clearance schemes are specially low to meet the circumstances of the occupants, e.g., the rents of the two and three apartment houses are usually about  12 and  15 (exclusive of rates) (in some cases even lower).The 588 bricklayers and masons might do The 697 carpenters might do ...The 149 slaters might do The 393 plumbers might do...3,500 houses.4,800 7,450 7,074
These rents are in some cases almost half the rents being charged for houses of similar accommodation under the 1924 Act.In Scotland, differing from England, the Slum Clearance Grant is available, not only in aid of the cost of houses under Improvement Schemes, but also in aid of the cost of houses erected to take the place of those closed by means of Closing and Demolition Orders. This enables the Local Authority that may not have a congested area but a number of separate uninhabitable houses throughout their district, to deal with the latter and rehouse the occupants.As will be seen from the figures above given, few of the houses in Slum Clearance Schemes are to be reconstructed. The experience is that they are seldom worth reconditioning. If, however, the principle of the Housing (Rural Workers) Act grant were extended, advantage might be taken by owners to effect improvements on existing houses in burghs which otherwise might remain in a defective condition.18. Regional and Town Planning.Reference is made in the pamphlet to large-scale regional planning. Practically nothing had been done up to the end of 1928 on Regional or Town Planning work  the Central Department having no available staff for the purpose. Local Authorities are, however, now becoming alive to the necessity of such planning, and with an adequate staff considerable progress could be made in this direction. Regional planning seems to be a necessary preliminary to any large scheme of road construction.Chapter Y. Telephones.   (Section IV of Pamphlet.)Memorandum by General Post Office.1. The telephone programme in the pamphlet rests on two premises : (1) that telephonically Great Britain is under-developed; (2) that development has been artificially stunted by financial restrictions.   The former is true, the latter is not.2. It is correctly stated that taking the proportion of telephones to population as the criterion of density, Great Britain is only the tenth country on the list, and that, out of thirty-one cities with over 100,000 telephones, London is the only British contribution. But the assertion that Berlin, with 54 per cent, of the population of London, has 80 per cent, of the number of telephones in London, is misleading, because the municipal area of Berlin (population 4 millions) is compared with the London telephone area (population *1\ millions), which includes considerable parts of Kent, Surrey, Essex and Hertfordshire. A fairer comparison would be between Berlin (population 4 millions), with 448,000 telephones, i.e., 9 inhabitants per telephone, and the administrative county of London (population 4^ millions), with 430,000 telephones, i.e., 10-4 inhabitants per telephone.3. &apos; The fact is that, apart from the Scandinavian countries, the telephone has not attained anything like the same popularity in Europe as it has in America. In fact, of the thirty-one cities mentioned above, only seven are European. The causes of this disparity are twofold and are not traceable to financial restrictions or to administrative inertia. In the first place, the growth of the &quot;telephone habit&apos;&apos; has been much slower in Europe; even large commercial undertakings in Great Britain which are fairly liberally equipped with telephones use them much less than in America, and with private residents the difference is still more marked. Secondly, though the cost of the telephone in Great Britain (and in most European countries) is rather below the American charges, it represents a much higher figure compared with the prevailing level of wages or salaries. In England, for example, a telephone costs the average small user about  9 a year. In America with the same number of calls it would cost  10 or  11, but that would represent less than a week&apos;s wages for a skilled man in the United States, while in England it represents the earnings of two weeks or more. In consequence it has been possible to develop the telephone in the United States to a much greater degree among the working classes. A comparison between the ratio of motor cars to population in Great Britain and America gives similar results. In Great Britain there were in 1927 about 26^ motor cars and 36 telephones per 1,000 of the population. In United States there were 200 motor cars and 160 telephones.
4. It is not true, as the pamphlet asserts, that development is strangled by-financial restrictions. A large staff is continuously employed throughout the country on personal canvassing, which is supplemented by Press publicity organised by the Telephone Development Association. The combined efforts of these agencies yield a gross addition of some 265,000 new telephones per annum. Against this must be set a loss of J.40,000, which are surrendered owing to death, removal or other causes, leaving a nett increase of about 125,000. It is inconceivable that increased publicity, whatever form it might take or with whatever vigour it was pressed, could raise this figure to 300,000 per annum or by 150 per cent., as the pamphlet suggests. Even on the present ratio of cessation to new orders this would mean a gross addition of 635,000 per annum; present experience shews that as the system extends the ratio of cessations tends to rise, and if an expansion on the scale contemplated ever materialised, no doubt a much higher proportion of cessations would have to be reckoned on.5. The British telephone system is at present supplemented by an annual capital programme of about  11,000,000, which enables it to carry an annual increase of 125,000 telephones with a working margin. If the annual rate of develop-ment rose to 140,000 or 150,000, the available margin would be absorbed probably in two years; larger programmes would have to be&apos;put in hand, but the bulk of the expenditure would not materialise for a year or two vears to come. A capital expenditure of  10,000,000 entails additional annual charges against the revenue account fur interest and amortisation of about  1,000,000 per annum. The aim of a telephone, administration should obviously be to keep the margin of spare plant, which earns no revenue, as small as possible with ability to execute new orders without delay.6. Herein lies the root fallacy of the scheme in the pamphlet. It proposes an immediate start on an immense programme of construction and expenditure, the scale of which has apparently been fixed on no considered or scientific data as to prospective demands. All present indications suggest that an annual demand on this scale is non-existent and would take many years to create. If the constructional programme proves to be excessive, the telephone service would be loaded with annual charges of some  6,000,000 per annum for plant, which for some time to come will earn little or no revenue. A programme of these dimensions would obviously give an immense fillip to the industries which depend directly or indirectly on telephone orders. Existing factories would have to be extended or new factories built, and the scale of production would have to be vastly increased. But production cannot permanently outrun demand and if demands fell seriously short of expecta-tions, as seems almost, certain, construction would have to be stopped at the conclusion of the five-year period, or even before. The disorganisation and hardship in the industries affected can easily be imagined if an annual expenditure of about  25.000,000 was suddenly terminated.The sensible policy is that followed for many years past, i.e., to watch closely the curve of demand and the prospective requirements of each individual area and to regulate the supply of equipment according to the needs of that area, so that a reasonable but not excessive margin of spare plant should be available.7. The pamphlet gives  81 as the average capital cost per added telephone during the past five years; this is correct if it were confined to plant only, but it ignores expenditure on land and buildings. If this were added the total capital cost would be  87 per telephone. The pamphlet estimates that the figure of  81 could be reduced by a more comprehensive programme to  63. If a programme on the scale suggested was put in hand no doubt some economies would be possible; on the other hand, as the telephones network becomes more widely spread, it is the experience both in America and elsewhere that the plant become complex and more costly; and the average length of line to a - subscriber tends to grow as the system spreads outside the urban centres. It is, therefore, thought that even on a provision for 1,500,000 additional telephones in five years the capital cost per added telephone could not be put lower than  75. On this basis the total cost would be  112,500,000 as compared with  55,000,000 at the present time, giving an increase of  57,000.000 instead of  45,000,000.8. It should be noted also that the planning and initiation of a programme on this scale, followed by the necessary purchase of sites and erection of buildings,
would occupy a considerable time and that there would be no prospect of an expendi-ture of an additional  15,000,000, in the next year at any rate, as the pamphlet suggests, still less of employing 20,000 additional men within three months of the programme being authorised.0. On the revenue side the pamphlet takes the existing revenue per subscriber, which is put at  15 per annum, and multiplies it by the additional 900,000 telephones to give an additional revenue of  13,500,000, which is stated to be exclusive of the extra, call revenue from existing subscribers. There is some confusion between new subscribers and new telephones, and it is difficult to follow the figures. But as all larger commercial undertakings and most small shops. &amp;c. are already supplied with telephones, the development must be sought mainly among residential sub-scribers, whose user is, on the average, much smaller. The existing average revenue per telephone from calls is  11 10s., but it cannot be taken without reduction as an index of the revenue which the additional telephones would yield. Judging from present indications, the extra annual revenue, including additional calls by existing subscribers, could not be put higher than  10 per added telephone, which would give a total additional revenue of  9,000,000 per annum on a capital expenditure of  57,500,000, or 15^ per cent, as compared with 27 per cent, claimed in the pamphlet. Unless the cost of operating, maintenance, &amp;c, could be materially reduced, this gross return would not be sufficient to maintain the service in solvency.Chapter YI.-Electrical Development.   (Section V of Pamphlet.)Memorandum by Ministry of Transport.1. The pamphlet starts by stating that the Country is committed to a great scheme of electrical development which is &quot; directly calculated to increase the efficiency of industry and the amenity of life,&quot; and makes no suggestion that any alteration is required in the scheme of the 1926 Act, which is the basis of this develop-ment. All the pamphlet has to propose is that, in addition, some stimulus ia required to distribution.2. At their maximum, therefore, these proposals are only an addition or annex to the scheme of the 1926 Act.The general proposition that a considerable and rapid increase in the distribu-tion systems is necessary in order to realise the expansion which the 1926 Act and the schemes adopted under it presuppose is self-evident. The only question is whether any action is necessary or possible to stimulate the normal development. As will be shown below, it is probable that the pamphlet considerably under-estimates the development which is in progress, but the Electricity Commissioners would hesitate before committing themselves to the view that this development is as rapid as it ought to be if full advantage is to be taken of the grid system. While the more progressive Companies and Municipalities are moving as fast as is reasonably possible in ordinary commercial prudence, the standard reached by them is by no means universal, and in many parts of the Country the Commissioners are not satisfied with the rate at which the distribution system is being developed. They have themselves recently issued a circular to all undertakers, enquiring what progress has been made in laying down the distribution mains and other works required, and a certain number of cases have been found where even a statutory minimum has not been reached.3. The pamphlet assumes that  150 million additional expenditure is required on distribution,, and divides this up under various headings. It is not clear what expenditure is included under the heading of distribution, If, however, the figure is taken from the Weir Report, it includes all services in connection with distribution and transmission, i,e., everything except the cost of generation and the actual construction of the grid and the estimate of the amount spent on these services during the three financial years 1926, 1927 and 1928, which is given as.15 million to 20 million, would be far too low. The Commissioners&apos; Statistical Returns show that the expenditure on main transmission and distribution in each of the four financial years up to and including 1925 amounted to  7,300,000,  9,100,000,  12,100,000, and  14,600,000 respectively, while the figure for 1926 (not yet published) was
 15,800,000, and it is probable that both in 1927 and 1928 this latter figure was -exceeded. It would appear, therefore, that the expenditure is already not far short of the  18 million a year which the pamphlet desires to spend. It may be noted that the rate of expenditure which the Weir Committee envisaged as being required was of the order of  10 million a year until about 1940.4. In estimating the number of men who would be employed for every million of expenditure a round figure of 60 per cent, as the proportion of the cost which labour bears to the total expenditure is based on the analogy of telephones. The cost of distribution systems is roughly divided between material and cost of labour in installation, the latter representing 33^ per cent, of the total cost. When allowance is made for the labour involved in the manufacture of the material purchased by the distributing authority, the figure of 60 per cent, given in the pamphlet would not appear to be too high. &apos;5. The figure of  68 million given in the pamphlet as the requirement for generating plant between now and 1940 is in excess of the estimate given in the Weir Report, which put the figure at about  54,000,000 between 1925 and 1940, but other calculations which the Commissioners have made suggest that the  68,000.000&apos; is more nearly correct.The suggestion in the pamphlet, however, that, as the result of expediting expenditure on distribution, expenditure on generating plant  3,500,000 in excess of average expenditure of recent years would be required is very doubtful. Reserve plant is in existence and the increased generating plant required by an accelerated increase of distribution might cost considerably less than the  3,500,000 per annum.6. Examination of the figures therefore shows that while the assumption as to the number of consumers of electricity, the total amount required for the increase of the distribution system and of the generating plant to deal with a demand of 500 units per head of population, are approximately correct, the actual rate of expenditure on distribution has been seriously under-estimated in the pamphlet.7. The chief difficulty, however, of increasing the level of present expenditure is that unemployment in all the skilled electrical trades is practically non-existent and the manufacture of the cables, meters and other plant cannot be indefinitely expanded; such unskilled labour as is required for the digging of trenches, &amp;c, is largely dependent on the skilled supervision available, and on the supply of materials which are the product of skilled labour. The fact that the actual expenditure during the last three years probably approaches the maximum suggested by the pamphlet might make the additional expenditure proposed still more difficult.8. The main difficulty in expediting expenditure on the distribution system is to give undertakers confidence that they will secure a reasonable return on the capital within a short time, and the pamphlet is entirely vague as to the means by which this is to be achieved. It states &apos;&apos; to secure these ends all that is necessary is to get the local authorities and Power Companies to stimulate local demand, and to assist them where necessary to secure the necessary additional capital. There is no question of adding to taxation. The policy is thoroughly business-like; it is merely one of progressive development at an accelerated rate.&apos;&apos; No reputable electrical company and no local authority has at the present moment the slightest difficulty in raising on reasonable terms any money required for electrical purposes, and unless an actual subsidy is contemplated the Commissioners are not aware of any financial measures which will assist.9. Another important consideration must be borne in mind. Assuming that expenditure on distribution could be expedited and the demand for current increased, the result might be that an increase of generating plant would be necessary in a number of existing non-selected stations or the smaller selected stations before the period when the Board is in a position to supply through the grid from the more efficient selected stations. Thus, too rapid a stimulation of distribution might result in the further development of generation on wrong lines. The logical sequence of proper development is that adopted by the 1926 Act, the creation of a proper main transmission system to enable generation to be conducted in the most efficient way and then an increase (on the present normal though marked annual development as given above) of the distribution systems to dispose of the energy so produced.
Chapter VII. Land Drainage.   (Section VI of Pamphlet.)(i.) Memorandum by Ministry of Agriculture.1. Section VI as a whole may, generally speaking, be said to be plausible, superficially correct and sound in theory, but there are flagrant omissions, and many legislative and other difficulties have been avoided or ignored.2. Page 40. &quot; One would expect a Tory Government, claiming always to be &apos; the farmer&apos;s friend,&apos; returned to power ivith a large majority, and, with plenty of time to plan and prepare, would long before now have had in execution great schemes of arterial drainage.&quot;The implication here is that recently nothing has been done, a suggestion for which there is no foundation.There have been altogether three main programmes of drainage works since the war involving State grants : (a.) From 1921-26 successive Governments embarked upon land drainage works for the relief of unemployment, primarily in agricultural districts. Most of these schemes, it is true, dealt with minor watercourses and main ditches, i.e., Category (2) in the pamphlet. The State grants (which included some for water supply schemes) amounted to over  900,000, of which the present Government were responsible for  221,000.(b.) As from the 1st April, 1926, the Department offered assistance towards larger land drainage schemes such as would come under Category (1) of the pamphlet. This programme was not intended primarily for the relief of unemployment. Some of these schemes have been completed, some are still being carried out and a few are not yet in active operation. By the time all are finished, it is estimated that the State contribution will have amounted to  420,000, or rather less than half the total cost of the schemes. This programme must, however, now be regarded as having been replaced by(c.) A new programme begun at the end of 1928 for the purpose of facilitating the transfer of unemployed labour from certain depressed areas, in furtherance of the policy recommended by the Industrial Transference Board. This programme has only recently been launched, but up to the present there are schemes either sanctioned, under consideration, or contemplated, of which the total cost will be about  900,000. These schemes will be financed either directly by the Ministry on the basis of 50 per cent, of the total cost, or by the Unemployment Grants Committee on the basis of a proportion of the loan charges during the period of the loan up to 30 years. Some of them will certainly fall under Category (1) of the pamphlet.(d.) The Department introduced a Bill in 1927 for the River Ouse under which a comprehensive scheme was contemplated, to cost  2,500,000, with an Exchequer grant of 50 per cent. The Bill failed to pass the Select Committee, and will be referred to later.3. Page 41. &quot; Three years ago, it discontinued Government grants towards the cost of county drainage administration.&quot;The facts are as follows: An important function of the Agricultural Committees which were set up in all counties under the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries Act, 1919, was to administer the &quot; control of cultivation&quot; provisions of the Corn Production Act, 1917, later re-enacted as Part I of the Agriculture Act, 1920. These Committees were equipped with staffs (including Drainage Officers), the cost of which was borne in the main by the Ministry. Most of this staff had to be dismissed owing to the Repeal in 1921 of Part I of the Agriculture Act, 1920, and all the Drainage Officers would undoubtedly have gone at that time, had it not been for the start in the following winter of the Unemployment Relief Schemes above referred to, which enabled County Councils to retain these officers and to charge their salaries as part of the cost of the schemes. Their retention until the Spring of 1926, when this programme came to an end was, therefore, in a sense fortuitous, and it is most misleading to suggest that there was a radical change of policy in 1926. The change took place in 1921, when the Corn Production Act was repealed.
It must be borne in mind, however, that the Land Drainage Act, which was passed later on in 1926, placed certain powers in the hands of County Councils, including the sole responsibility for carrying out small schemes of land drainage in areas for which a Drainage Authority could not conveniently be set up. These small schemes would be largely of the type of those carried out during the previous five years as unemployment relief schemes, and it was felt that in the light of the five years&apos; experience during which State grants had been made, County Councils, if armed with the necessary compulsory powers for which they had asked, might reasonably be expected to carry out a considerable number of schemes wholly at the expense of the land owners. It was also felt that, with the other powers conferred upon them by this Act, they might also be reasonably expected, if they took a serious view of their responsibilities, to maintain a Drainage Officer at their own expense.4. Page 41. Referring to the Royal Commission on Land Drainage, the pamphlet says : &quot; Yet, in the face of this strong recommendation of their own Commission, the Government have done nothing whatsoever even in the way of legislation. Their latest pronouncement is that before any other step can be taken another eighteen months or tiuo years must be occupied in a leisurely survey by a handful of officials.&quot;No mention is made of any of the difficulties. The Commission made a point of recommending legislation which would not be merely permissive, but would impose definite obligations on the bodies concerned, and incidentally would involve a complete change from the existing state of things. The Drainage Area of the future was to be the Catchment Area, the whole of which was to be subjected to drainage rates. Obviously, therefore, the most important of these areas had first to be delineated on a map, otherwise there would be no precise indication as to what parties, e.g., County Councils, &amp;c, were to appoint members on to the Catchment Area Authorities.No doubt a rapid survey could have been carried out with two or three times the special staff now engaged, but it is doubtful whether ultimately any more rapid progress could have been made, since (a.) It is obvious that a measure of such wide scope and revolutionary character could not have been prepared in time to be introduced in the 1928 session, within two or three months of the issue of the Royal Commission&apos;s Report.(6.) Just after the Royal Commission reported, the State embarked upon the Derating Scheme, which to some extent cuts across the Royal Commission&apos;s proposals and raises very complicated questions. Under the Commission^ proposals the &quot;uplands &quot; of each Catchment Area, which have never paid a drainage rate before, are to be so rated, the new Authorities indenting on the County Councils for their contributions. Under the Derating Scheme these contributions, if included by County Councils in their ordinary rates, will be collected to some extent from property other than agricultural land and factories. This difficulty will have to be overcome, but it has not facilitated the introduction of any new Drainage Bill. Indeed, it has made it impossible even to consider the details of this part of a Drainage Bill until the derating scheme is a fait accompli.A promise could, however, be made to introduce a Bill in 1930. and there would be some advantages in so fixing the date.5. Page 41. &quot; The Land Drainage Act of 1918 gave the Ministry of Agri-culture certain direct powers to undertake land drainage. By an Act of 1926 those powers were transferred to the County Councils. Emergency legislation should restore them to the Ministry for a limited period, and amplify them, so as to cover arterial drainage.&apos;&apos;There is hopeless confusion here. The Land Drainage Act, 1926, gives County Councils some useful powers. Among them are the power to compel the clearing of ditches, &amp;c, of obstructions (which has been largely enforced), and also the power to carry out small schemes compulsorily, which the County Councils are the proper Bodies to carry out. These are not powers which the Ministry can effectively carry out, and no amplification of the 1918 Act to cover arterial drainage (which, as a matter of fact, it already does) could achieve any useful purpose, except on the lines of the Royal Commission&apos;s Report.The pamphlet seems to ignore the existence of the hundreds of Drainage Authorities who are now struggling to carry on their responsibilities.   It is true
that only a few of them control large areas like the Ouse Basin, but, seeing the hopeless impasse that has arisen in that particular district, largely because the cost of the necessary works is far too great for the rateable area to bear, it is not clear what good can be achieved by deliberately creating more of these large areas in face of the limitations of the present law. The main fault that the Royal Commission found with the present situation was that the area hitherto liable to be rated on the grounds of being benefited was much too small to bear the cost of the works needed. They came to the conclusion that the burden must be spread over the whole catchment area.6. It is idle to talk of large drainage schemes being undertaken ad libitum. They have been successfully undertaken in moderation, but the time has now arrived when, even with a generous State grant, Drainage Authorities cannot find their quota of the cost. If, pending the new legislation, the need should arise for further works to be carried out as emergency works or otherwise, the Exchequer will either have to find the whole cost, or what it does not find it will have to lend, because most Drainage Authorities are quite unable to raise a loan in the open market at the present time, owing to the success which has attended passive resistance to the payment of rates in the Ouse District and elsewhere&apos;. The difficulty of carrying out a large scheme, even with a 50 per cent. Exchequer grant, is strikingly illustrated by the failure of the Ouse Bill of 1927 to pass Committee.7. Page 41. &quot;A central co-ordinating authority, charged with the responsi-bility of examining any scheme affecting waterways, from the point of view not only of drainage, but water power, water supply, inland navigation, fishing, and so on.&quot;This is sound. Land Drainage, Pollution and Navigation are closely related, and if any authority is set up for each main river, it is clearly desirable that it should deal with other water questions. This has, in fact, been recommended by more than one Commission.There would be obvious advantages if there were one central department dealing with rivers and foreshore from every point of view, but the question of public health will always have some considerable bearing on this problem.8. Page 42. &quot;The -way in which the cost shall be borne must be matter for consideration. Two things, however, are clear. First, we must face the fact that it must be borne primarily, and in the case of large arterial drainage schemes very largely, at the public expense.&quot;This implies an offer of a more generous contribution than that now given, but the promise of these words is somewhat attenuated by those that follow : &quot; The second is, that land which in any degree benefits from ii shall be required to make due contribution.&apos;&apos;This, then, presumably leaves the position exactly where it is now. The whole difficulty at present is that those who have to pay on the grounds of benefit received are now at the end of their tether, hence the recommendation to spread the burden.9. Page 42. &quot; There is no doubt that, given this financial assistance and this legislative authority, backed by an effective Government, 50,000 men could be working on necessary schemes of arterial drainage within six months.&quot;On the type of scheme which is referred to as arterial drainage, i.e., Category (1) of the pamphlet, the cost of materials, plant, &amp;c, is at least 50 per cent, of the total cost. It is estimated that on this basis about 400 men could be directly employed for a year for every  100,000 spent. This means that 50,000 men would involve a total expenditure on schemes in one year of  12,500,000, on the assumption that navvy rates were generally payable.It is true that the pamphlet qualifies its statement by talking about the necessary legislative authority, but, even so, no account is taken of the time involved in the surveys and in the preparation of plans and sections before any large river works can be undertaken, or the time that must be spent in complying with the statutory notices that are required under existing legislation before any work can begin. As an example, it may be mentioned that in connection with the Ministry &apos;s 1926 programme the principle of assisting outfall wdrks for the River Wellahd, which will confer a wide benefit over the whole of the district served by that river, was accepted from the very start of the programme. Three years have now elapsed, during which the Welland Board have been arguing among themselves and
negotiating with other neighbouring drainage and harbour authorities, and, although the negotiations are now believed to be almost at an end, effective work has not yet started.10. Page 42. &quot; There remains, the drainage of minor water-courses and main ditches.&quot;It will have been observed that, at the beginning of the section dealing with Land Drainage, the pamphlet divides drainage works into three heads : (1.) Arterial drainage, i.e., drainage of the main river channels; (2.) Minor water-courses and main ditches; and (3.) Field drainage.We can ignore for the moment (as the pamphlet ignores) field drainage, but the distinction between the other two is in practice not very obvious. Arterial drainage (in the normal sense of the word) clearly covers a great deal of drainage other than the main rivers; or, to put it another way, there are hundreds of miles of rivers which could not be called main river channels, and yet which could not in any circumstances be categorised as minor streams and ditches. The distinction may, however, have been drawn in the pamphlet in order to show that the various programmes of State assistance have done little or nothing on the main rivers. This is true to some extent, but it is due to the fact that there are comparatively few main rivers, e.g., the Welland and Ouse, and possibly the Witham, that are under authorities sufficiently powerful to dp the class of work that is contemplated under (1) of the pamphlet. But the fact remains that, however the schemes are classified, a very considerable amount of work has been done in the last 4 years.11. The pamphlet states that 30,000 men could be employed per year for each of the next two years on watercourses and ditches &quot; provided adequate State help were given.&quot;It is true, that there is still a great amount of work to be done in the areas of the smaller drainage authorities as well as in those Counties where there are few, if any statutory drainage authorities, and no doubt a large amount could be done if the Exchequer offered terms better than anything offered before, say four-fifths of the cost; but there are certain considerations to be borne in mind. On the basis that in these schemes materials and plant would account for 20 per cent., so that 900 men per year could be employed directly (at agricultural rates) for every  100,000 spent, the direct employment of 30,000 men would mean an expenditure per year of about  3,500,000. Moreover, as unemployment in the rural areas is comparatively slight, the greater portion of these 30,000 men would have to be transported from urban into rural areas.The Ministry&apos;s 1921-26 programme was designed chiefly for the relief of unemployment in rural areas, and it was a condition of that programme that, save in exceptional cases, the wages should be at the agricultural rate. As long as there were a certain amount of agricultural unemployed to be absorbed, no difficulties arose, but one of the reasons for stopping . these schemes was that it became increasingly difficult to obtain agricultural unemployed. The pamphlet ignores the fact that the transportation of 30,000 men into rural districts would raise acute difficulties as regards wages. It would obviously be impossible to pay these men agricultural rates. On the other hand, if they were paid the navvy rate, the effect on the labour employed by the farmers in the locality would be very disturbing.In the case of Estuary works and the clearing of main rivers, this difficulty is not so serious, because the men employed on these works can be usually kept together in special hutments or barges, and not scattered over the countryside.Apart from this, however, it is inconceivable, in the light of the Ministry&apos;s experience, that the British farmer is, on the basis of the figures quoted in the pamphlet, likely to find money for drainage work of this minor character, which even on the basis of a 25 per cent, contribution would mean in the aggregate a sum approaching  1,000,000 for each of the next two years, especially as he will also have to contribute towards works under Category (1) which as above shown are going to cost in the gross something like  12,500,000 per annum.(ii.) Memorandum, by Board of agriculture, Scotland.1. Arterial Drainage,.Existing legislation in Scotland is defective in the matter of providing facilities for the maintenance and improvement of arterial drainage systems. [19066] g 2
2. Minor Watercourses, Main Ditches,  Farm (Arable and Pastoral) Drainage (pages 40-43).These forms of drainage have for several years been aided under the Depart-menfs scheme for assisting Agricultural drainage. In terms of the scheme limited funds are available each year from which the Department offer to applicants grants up to a maximum limit of one-third of the cost of approved work.So far as Scotland is concerned, farm or field drainage, although skilled work, is not carried out largely with power-driven appliances. In the Departments view, it is as worthy of assistance and as easily capable of inclusion in a scheme of public assistance as any other form of drainage.3. The Department have not undertaken any detailed survey of the drainage requirement of Scotland. Unless it were carried out at great expense, the results of an investigation of the kind would fall far short of accuracy. A fair idea of the amount of urgently required drainage in Scotland is conveyed by the applications received each year for assistance under the Drainage Scheme. The following are the grants applied for in the last three years :  1926    ... ... ... ... ...      38,5731927    ... ... ... ... ...      31,7771928    ... ... ... ... ...      34,513If funds had been available to satisfy all these applications, and if the grants offered had been fully earned, the amount of employment thus provided would have been equivalent to 1926 ... ... ...      907 men for a year.1927 ... ... ...      776 men for a year.1928 ... ... ...      843 men for a year.The advantages of the scheme are that, after the Department have approved a grant, the applicant himself must pay for the work as carried out, and only after the Department are satisfied of the quality of the work is the grant up to a limit of one-third of the cost paid to the applicant. The applicant has a direct interest in securing that the quality of the work is good and the cost as low as possible.But for these grants it would have been impracticable for hundreds of farmers to have carried out drainage under current conditions.Chapter VIII. London Passenger Transport.   (Section VII of Pamphlet.)Memorandum by Ministry of Transport.1. The great majority of the proposals consists of those considered by the London Traffic Advisory Committee in the course of the Public Enquiries held by them into the travelling facilities for certain parts of London. While reporting in favour of most of them, the Committee expressed the opinion as regards the major schemes of tube railway extensions and the electrification of existing lines that the chief obstacle to their being carried into effect was the question of finance, and that this obstacle could only be successfully overcome by a scheme of co-ordination of London passenger transport agencies. Bills promoted by the Underground Companies and the London County Council with this object are now before Parliament.2. As regards the cost of the proposals and the practicability of executing them within the next few years, it may be assumed that such of them as promise to be remunerative will be put in hand by the undertakings concerned so soon as they are in a position to do so. This applies to the extension of the Piccadilly Railway to Manor House and Southgate, and the electrification of the L.M.S. line to Dagenham. As stated below the Underground Company have taken certain preliminary steps in regard to the former, and the L.M.S. Railway Company are seeking powers in the present Session in connection with the latter.All such proposals necessitate parliamentary powers, and in the most favourable circumstances a period of a year or more would elapse between the time when it is decided to embark on a scheme and the date when work could commenoe.
3.   Details of the proposals, with comments thereon, are set out. below : (A.) North London.Scheme.Remarks.(1.) Extension of the Piccadilly Bail-way to Manor House and Southgyate.(2.) Extension of the Highgate tube East Finchley.to(3.) Electrification of L.N.E.R. from Finsbury Park to High Barnet and Edgware, with connections to provide through running on the G.N. &amp; City, and between the latter and the Metropolitan at Moorgate.This proposal was recommended by the London Traffic Advisory Committee.The investigations of the London Electric Railway Company indicate that the existing congestion would be best remedied by an extension of the Piccadilly line in the direction of Wood Green. The Company estimate the cost of constructing such a tube at  850,000 per mile. It is under-stood that the Company have sur-veyed and provisionally settled the line of the extension, and have made arrangements for the acquisition of some portions of the land required. They are not, however, prepared to proceed further with the matter at this time, as they do not consider that the financial position is such as to enable them to raise the necessary capital required to build the extension on economical terms.The Committee originally proposed to explore the possibilities of this extension and to make a further report thereon (Report on North and North-East London), but the matter was not pursued when it became apparent that the Underground Rail-way Companies were not prepared to embark on any further tube exten-sions in present circumstances. The extension was urged by the repre-sentatives of the Finchley Urban District Council at the Enquiry. The opinion was offered on behalf of the London Electric Railways Company that &quot; this would be the cheapest way of getting a development north of Highgate which would have the effect of draining off some of the traffic now going to Finsbury Park, and bringing it into London over a tube railway which is not being used to anything like its full capacity.&quot; The representation of the Electric Railways Company stated, however, that it would be impossible to provide this railway as well as the extension to Southgate referred to under No. (1) and that their investigations pointed to the necessity for providing a tube railway in the latter direction rather than in any other.See (B.) (6) below.
Scheme.(4.) Provision of interchange stations at Manor House and Golders Green for tubes, omnibuses and trams.Remarks.The Committee recommended that the transport undertakings concerned should give further consideration to &quot;the possibilities of an interchange station at Manor House, but no steps have yet been taken to provide one.As regards Golders Green, negotia-tions have been protracted and owing to opposition on the part of the local authority to the scheme put forward, have so far been unsuccessful. The transport undertakings have formu-lated a new scheme, which is now being discussed with the local authority.(B.) East London.(5.) New Electric Railway from Liver-pool Street via Bethnal Green, Victoria Park (in tube), Leyton and &quot;West Walthamstow to Walton Cross (on surface).The Committee, while fully appreciating the great advantages which would accrue to the districts traversed by the proposed new line, considered that the cost of construction would b,e sq, great as to make it&apos; doubtful whether the revenue which might be derived from its operation, at any rate in the earlier years, would provide an adequate return on the capital. They therefore hesitated to suggest that the Railway should be constructed until a careful estimate of cost had been prepared, together with a state-ment showing the possible financial results of operation (Report on East London).The proposed railway follows approximately the line of that pro-jected under the North East London Railway Act, 1905, which has now lapsed. The proposal was strongly supported at the Enquiry by the representatives of the Councils of Hackney, Leyton, Chingford and Waltham Holy Cross. It was stated that representatives of these four Councils were prepared to advise their Councils, should private capital not be forthcoming, to seek parliamentary powers to authorise the Government and the Local Authorities to assist financially in providing such facilities. Witnesses representing other interests were questioned as to the value of this proposed railway, and opinion was generally in favour of the project, but ho representative of Local Authorities other than those mentioned above was prepared to endorse the policy of finaricial assistance from the rates for such undertakings.
Scheme.(6.) Electrification of L.N.E.R. from Liverpool Street to Romford and to Loughton with new &quot; fly-over &quot; junction at Stratford.(7.) New &quot; fly-over &quot; junction at Aldgate East.(8.) Aldgate interchange Station.(9.) Electrification of existing L.M.S. (L.T. &amp; S.) Line and extension of District Railway Service from Barking to Upminster.(10.) New connection between existing lines from Fenchurch Street to Pdackwall and Canning Town to Becktbn (connecting all the docks) ; Eleotrincatibn of the whole and extension by new surface line to Dagenham, Becdn-tree and Roinford.Remarks.The Committee have expressed the view that the electrification of the suburban lines of the L.N.E.R. would afford the speediest means of providing a sub-stantial improvement in the train services.The reluctance of the Railway Cbm-pany in the matter is well understood in view of their financial position and the enormous expenditure which would be involved in effecting the develop-ment. It is understood that the Com-pany has given close consideration recently to the question, but up to now they have been unable to see their way to embai&apos;k on the scheme.The Committee recommended that this junction should be constructed, but so far as is known neither of the Com-panies concerned, namely, the Metro-politan and the Metropolitan District, have taken any action in the matter. The Committee were advised that the cost of such a junction would be very high, probably in the neighbourhood of  1,500,000.No information is available concerning this proposal. The matter was not raised at the inquiry held by the Com-mittee into travelling facilities in East London.It was stated on behalf of the Metro -politan District Railway Company at the Inquiry that if the line between Barking and Upminster were elec-trified, they would be prepared to project district trains to Upminster, and the Committee suggested that the L.M.S. Railway Company should give further consideration to the proposal.The L.M.S. Company have since co-operated actively in measures for the improvement in the capacity of the line between Barking and Central London. Automatic signalling be-tween Bow and Barking was completed and brought into use from the begin-ning of March, 1928, enabling addi-tional trains to be operated during the rush hours, and additional facilities will be provided as soon as new rolling stock which has been ordered is de-livered. The Company are also seeking powers in the present session to carry out works which will enable them to improve their services to Becoutree and Dagehham. They propose to construct a &quot;fly-over&apos;.&apos; junction at Bromley in order thai, the steamrtrain service between Dagenhain and Broad Street   can  be  augmented  without

It is improbable that the Company would be prepared at the present time to carry out either of the two schemes next referred to. The first was not recommended by the Committee and the other was not brought to its notice.(C.) South-East London.(12.) New connection between Metro-politan (East London) and Southern Railways at New Cross, providing, in conjunction with Nos. A. 3 and B. 7, direct con-nection between the G.C. and G.N. systems of the L.N.E.R. and the Southern Railway.This development was urged by the Metropolitan Railway Company, but the Southern Railway stated that after examining the volume of pas-senger traffic, which passed from the Southern Railway to the East London Railway, they had come to the con-clusion that there was no public demand for such facility.The Committee recommended that the Southern Railway Company should immediately give further consideration to the suggestion. The construction of the proposed &quot; fly-over &quot; junction at Aldgate East (see B. 7 above) would be an essential part of the scheme. So far as is known, the Southern Railway Company have not moved in the matter.(D.) West London.(13.)

Land Reclamation.   (Section VIII of Pamphlet.)^-Memorandum by Ministry of Agriculture.1. No figures are given in the short note on Reclamation in the pamphlet, but reference is made, not only to the reclamation of water-logged land, but to the recovery of land from the sea.  The vagueness of the proposals will be noted.2. The reclamation of water-logged land is covered substantially by drainage operations already referred to.Reclamation in the Wash has, for centuries, proceeded by gradual stages as the land becomes ripe, and that is the way it must continue, but, unfortunately, no one but the Crown has sufficient capital to carry it out. It is regrettable, in this connection, that the clauses in the Ouse Bill (which were agreed with the Norfolk Estuary Company) for the transfer to the Crown of the rights and powers which the Company owns, and can exercise over a large areabf the Wash, had to suffer the fate of the rest of the Bill.
A new and comprehensive scheme for dealing with the drainage system of the Ouse, which has recently been submitted to the Ministry and is now under considera-tion, would involve the construction of two training walls seawards into the Wash. These walls would be half tidal, i.e., sometimes covered with water and at other times uncovered. Their construction would lead to rapid accretion, especially on the side where the State is the owner of the frontage, but is prevented from reclaiming seawards by the rights of the Estuary Company above referred to.3. If the State proceeds with the Ouse works, it is to be urged that the left training wall should be built as an embankment and not as a half tidal bank, because it will then become the right bank of all the land which can be subsequently reclaimed by the State in front of their existing property. In other words, advantage should be taken of any Ouse works to build an embankment and a training wall in one an operation which will mean a vast saving later on and, quite possibly, reclamation upon an economic basis, and on a large scale.This plan, which was submitted to the Ministry of Labour as a reconditioning scheme but has not been proceeded with, cannot be too strongly recommended. There are areas which the Commissioners of Crown Lands could, and are believed to be anxious to, reclaim now (if they could get the Estuary Company out of the way). These could be started soon and could be gradually extended as the left embankment of the Ouse was completed and assisted accretion. A drainage scheme which would settle the Ouse problem, combined with reclamation works (which might thus become economic), would be a highly effective and even spectacular adventure.(ii.) Memorandum by Development Commission.1. The Development Commissioners have done their utmost, since they were first constituted, to provide facilities for testing the economic possibilities of land reclamation. The schemes considered by them, many of which underwent preliminary survey, included barren heath lands, bogs and varieties of other land unsuitable for cultivation, as well as land which might be recovered from the sea. Only in a few cases have such schemes been carried out. This has been due in the main to the heavy cost involved and the uncertainty of the return to be expected. Costs included land purchase, improvement by whatever method of treatment was appropriate, transport, supervision, &amp;c. There remained the cost of equipping and stocking the land when reclaimed. It may be said that such schemes as were carried out proved so costly as to prescribe the utmost caution in extending the field of operations. Methwold and Wainfleet (dealt with below) are cases in point. In their tenth annual report, for the year ended the 31st March, 1920, the Commissioners remarked that most of the schemes they had under review were &quot; in an economic sense far from promising. They (the Commissioners) have repeatedly had to leave hopeful-looking schemes to stand over as a result of engineering and agricultural surveys, and an examination of the probable purchase price involved. And with the present range of prices the outlook is even more discouraging than it was before the War.&quot; The prospect to-day, when small and large farmers alike find it difficult to make a living out of good land, well equipped with buildings, is certainly no brighter than it was in 1920.2. References to reclamation work undertaken at home in the eighteenth century, and to similar undertakings abroad, must be looked at in relation to the circumstances, if correct deductions are to be drawn from them. Coke of Norfolk&apos;s great schemes, for instance, were carried out when the cost of labour was negligible and on land belonging to Coke. To-day, if the cost of labour devoted to improving waste land is set against the assumed value of the fertility and productivity of the land improved, the balance must, as a rule, be heavily against the enterprise. No relevant generalisations can be drawn from foreign practice owing to dissimilarity of conditions, engineering, agricultural, conditions of land tenure, and social and economic conditions. Something can, of course, always be made of reclamation at a price. In parts of Northern Germany visited by two of the Commissioners in 1913, reclamation of heath lands and bogs was being vigorously undertaken by the State and the Local Authorities, convict labour being largely employed. It was impossible to obtain intelligible financial particulars, though every effort was made by direct inquiry and through the Foreign Office.   In one of the holdings reclaimed by the
labour of tbe people on the spot, a woman and child were seen drawing a wooden plough over the improved surface. The motive actuating the German policy of reclamation can hardly have been that of economic development.3. Wainfleet (Wash). In June 1919, an advance of  94,300 was made to the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, on the recommendation of the Commissioners, for the following purposes : (a.) Cost of acquiring about 2,980 acres of foreshore, with existing frontagerights, between the River Witham and Gibraltar Point  29,800. (b.) Cost of reclamation works for the enclosure of about 1,500 acres of theabove  foreshore at Freiston, Wrangle, Friskney and Wainfleet, Esti-mated at  38 per acre  57,000. (c.) Such sum as might be necessary up to  5 per acre embanked to cover the extra cost of embanking by the employing of unskilled labour  7,500.In March 1921 the Commissioners were told that the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries stated that the scheme had been radically modified towards the end of 1919, that the work had proved anything but economic and that it had been decided to close down all reclamation works in the interests of economy.Only about 338 acres were actually enclosed, the net cost being estimated at  56,550 or  167 per acre. It should be noted that a hutted camp was provided for a much larger number of men than were subsequently employed, that the cost of labour was higher and the skill less than had been anticipated. Part of the land was taken over by the Wainfleet Farm Settlement, and in 1928 the remaining 283 acres were sold for  13 per acre.4. Methwold (Norfolk). Though this scheme does not deal with water-logged land, it is quoted as an example of general reclamation. As an experiment in reclaiming about 200 acres of poor sandy land in Norfolk during the war gave promising results, the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries submitted a scheme after the war for purchasing some 1,300 acres and equipping them for experiment at an estimated initial cost of  56,500. The Commissioners were, however, only prepared to recommend  37,500, as they considered it unwise to invest so much as  41 per acre in farming capital in the early stages. Later a further sum of about  7,000 was provided for that purpose. At the end of 1924-25 it was decided to discontinue the scheme and the land was sold to the Forestry Commission. The accounts presented by the Comptroller and Auditor-General showed an accumulated loss over 5-  years of  44,824 and an estimated cash expenditure after deducting charges for interest, insurance and headquarters expenses and adding certain recoverable sums of  33,933. The Commissioners feel that, in spite of this heavy cost, material of much value was collected. Their general view of the results of the experiment is given on pp. 139-141 of their Sixteenth Report for the year ended the 31st March, 1926, from which the following is a quotation : &apos;&apos; Favoured by relatively good natural conditions and unhampered by the terms of tenure, with command of capital, and with modern business methods; able, moreover, to claim all the advantages which scientific knowledge could confer, the Ministry has not found it advisable to retain Methwold in the interests of food production, and the land has been sold to the Forestry Commis-sion to be planted with the conifers for which the soil is suited.&apos;&apos; This experience should help the nation to realise how small the prospects are of adding to the country&apos;s food supply by reclaiming those extensive areas of land which our forefathers have not attempted to till because of their inherent poverty. If at any future period large additions to the home-grown food supply must be made, the necessary acres must be found by ploughing up cultivated grass land, as was done during the war, and not by reclaiming the land now classed in the Agricultural Returns as &apos; Mountain and Heath.&apos; &quot;5. There are no doubt many areas in the country capable of reclamation, and the Development Commissioners have from time to time provided surveys or recommended advances for this purpose. Speaking generally, these reclamations were not proceeded with because the results did not appear likely to justify the work from an economic point of view.
6.   The following instances may be mentioned : (i.) The Borth Bog in Cardiganshire: an area of 4,450 acres; the cost of acquiring and reclaiming was estimated in 1919 at  81,000, but it was considered later that this was too low a figure. Much of the land consists of deep peat, the value of which, after reclamation, is problematical, (ii.) St. Bury an Crofts, Cornwall: the Commissioners in 1919 recommended an advance of  41,900 for reclamation of 770 acres of waste land near Land&apos;s End. The work would have provided employment for 300 men for four months; it was proposed to settle ex-service men on the land, but that would not now be a hopeful arrangement owing to the fall in agricultural values.(iii.) St. Breock Downs, Cornwall: an advance of  66,000 was recommended for the reclamation of 2,000 to 2,500 acres most of the reclamation would have been by steam power, so from the point of view of employment the possibilities were not considerable.These schemes were dropped at the time the Reclamation Branch of the Ministry of Agriculture was given up.(iv.) Meat hop Marsh, Westmoreland: The Commissioners recommended an advance of  18,500 for the reclamation of 400 acres of estuarine flats in Morecambe Bay. It was proposed to employ about 150 skilled men and 100 unskilled. The scheme has since been carried out by the Ministry of Agriculture.7. Numerous areas which have been surveyed with a view to reclamation  such as Otmoor, Oxfordshire, Flanders Moss, Perthshire, and Lochar Moss, Dumfrie-shire were not proceeded with as they did not present economic possibilities. An area in the estuary of the River Forth has possibilities of successful reclamation from an industrial point of view.8. While the above list of cases shows how difficult it is to find large areas of land in this country which, in the public interest, it would be desirable to reclaim, the Commissioners do not wish it to be inferred that reclamation as a means of economic improvement should be ruled out of consideration. On the contrary they think that all schemes of land reclamation offering any prospect of success should be carefully examined. As an example they may refer to a project of peat reclama-tion in the Island of Lewis which is at present engaging the attention of the Scottish Department of Agriculture. Since the war considerable advances have been made in methods of peat-reclamation in Northern Europe, and success has been met with under conditions not dissimilar from those existing in the North-West of Scotland. Where, as in the Island of Lewis, there is a large population and a great scarcity of cultivable land, reclamation would be specially valuable for purposes of land settlement. On the other hand, since European experience indicates that economic peat-reclamation depends largely on the use of specially designed machines it is unlikely that this type of enterprise, even if undertaken on an extensive scale, could do much to alleviate unemployment among industrial workers.9. Prevention of Coast Erosion. Small advances have been made from the Development Fund in this connection for protection of part of the Romney Marsh district; it was proposed that a comprehensive scheme for the area should be started, but it was found impossible to get the various authorities into line. Schemes for preventing erosion at Walton-on-the-Naze, Blundell-sands, Scarborough and Barmouth, were put forward, but these were for the protection of residential property, with which the Development Commission is not concerned.(iii.) Memorandum by Board of Agriculture, Scotland.1. Undoubtedly there is scope in Scotland for extensive schemes of land reclamation. It is accepted, however, that at present such work is not &quot;economic,&quot; and that the cost per acre will in general exceed the value of the land when improved. Any area of land that could be reclaimed, save at excessive cost, would provide for the settlement of only a very small number of new holders.[19066] h 2
2. Land Reclamation usually requires to be carried out in the better months of the year when the water level is low. It could not, therefore, be expected to absorb much labour in winter when the unemployment problem is acute.3. So far as relief of unemployment is concerned, there is little value in the statement that &apos;&apos; lands in Scotland given over to sport can likewise be recovered for food and livelihood.&quot; If golf courses are referred to, these employ or account for more labour than if the land were used for agricultural purposes. If deer forests are indicated, the agricultural value and certainly the land settlement value of the larger proportion of such lands is negligible or very low.Chapter X. Afforestation.Memorandum by the Forestry Commissioners.1. The facts stated in the paragraph on Afforestation on page 48 of the pamphlet are, broadly speaking, correct, except: Line   7. 27,000 acres shoulcTbe 23,000.Line 11. &quot;Not much more than 20,000 acres a year&quot; should be &quot;23,700 acres a year, including 1,200 acres of replacements.&quot;2. The Commissioners consider that the recommendation of the Industrial Transference Board, that 1,000 forest workers&apos; holdings should be created for ex-miners in &quot;the next three years,&quot; went too far. While not impossible, providing sufficient notice is given, it is not advisable from a purely Forestry point of view. It should only be adopted if the urgency is so great that it becomes advisable to embark upon a great acceleration of land purchase, planting programme, nursery operations, &amp;c. A sudden increase of this kind would prove expensive beyond the normal, and an additional staff, both for holdings and forest operations, would have to be extemporised.If the claims of local labour to holdings were ignored, there would be a justifiable outcrjr. Of the new holdings, part only can therefore be allocated to miners.A proper balance between Forest operations and numbers of Holdings must be maintained -at present the basis is 5 holdings per 1,000 acres of plantable land, and in the view of the Commissioners should not at present be increased. The present rate of establishing holdings is about 150 per annum, including the making up of arrears (the holdings scheme was not initiated until 5 years after the Commission were established), but this number would increase proportionately with the rate of plantable land acquired. In certain localities, such as parts of the Scottish Hicrhlands, where crofters are available, the full quota of holdings is not required.3. The Commissioners agree with the recommendation that State afforestation-tion should be steadily extended. The views are embodied in a Memorandum circulated to the Cabinet in December 1927. They recommended that the afforestation programme for the decade 1929-39 should lie between a minimum of 330,000 acres and a maximum of 550,000 acres, the former programme entailing Votes aggregating  8 million. Approval has since been given to a programme of 225,000 acres (exclusive of replacements), costing  5-^ million.The  5-1 million programme will employ approximately 3,000 forest workers on an average throughout the year; the  8 million programme approximately 4,500 men.4. The Commissioners&apos; case for increasing the rate of afforestation is, briefly, that the reserves of timber are lower and the state of the woodlands of the Country is worse than was anticipated before a detailed census of woodlands was made in 1924, while the rate of reconstruction is quite inadequate. Private enterprise cannot be relied upon to make good this unsatisfactory position (resulting chiefly from war fellings), and more energetic State action is necessary; Great Britain is the largest importer of timber, but the state of world supplies of soft woods is such that she -cannot rely on obtaining everything required from abroad.
The Commissioners now have 9 years&apos; experience of large-scale afforestation operations and believe that the technical difficulties can be dealt with; timber grows well in this Country, and when properly handled home-grown timber is suitable for all ordinary commercial purposes. In connection with forestry, good opportunities arise for employment of unskilled labour and for land settlement. The movement is popular.On the other hand, there is a considerable initial outlay (against which a valuable national asset is being built up) and also a disturbance of existing land utilisation, although not on a significant scale.Chapter XI. Canals.Memorandum by Ministry of Transport.1. It is perhaps significant that this section of the pamphlet is prefaced by the remark that the &quot; development of motor transport is an important new factor affecting the canals.&quot; It is obvious that the road programme contemplated in an earlier section must not only militate against any addition to canal traffic, but must make it increasingly difficult for the canals to retain existing traffic. To embark public money in schemes for improving the canals and at the same time to spend vast sums in encouraging a rival means of transport would be inconsistent.The pamphlet contents itself with suggesting that &quot; a certain limited amount of work can possibly be done under present conditions provided loans on advantageous terms are made available,&quot; especially by &quot; rationalised &quot; companies. But rationalisation-tion must go further than it has done, and it is suggested that the first step must be the adoption of some such scheme as that recommended by Mr. Neville Chamberlain&apos;s Committee in 1921. Labour could then be employed advantageously in widening and modernising the canal system, particularly the &quot;Cross.&quot;2. In June 1921 Mr. Neville Chamberlain&apos;s Committee on Inland Waterways presented an interim report in which they referred to the recommendations of the Royal Commission on Canals and Inland Waterways, 1906, and particularly the recommendation that unification of ownership should be achieved by progressively substituting the State for the existing owners of the waterways comprising &quot; the Cross,&quot; i.e., the waterways connecting Birmingham with the estuaries of the Mersey, Humber, Thames and Severn respectively.The Committee rejected nationalisation of the whole canal system as a solution since such a course would involve liabilities greater than the Nation was prepared to accept. As an alternative they proposed that the waterways should be divided into seven groups or systems, and that each group should be placed under unified control and ownership. Having come to the conclusion that for financial reasons the groups could not be left to private ownership, the Committee recommended that they should be owned and administered by public trusts limited as to dividend and financed wholly or partly by the State and the local authorities concerned.3. No steps were taken by the State to give effect to these recommendations. Apart from any general objection to providing capital out of public funds for such a purpose, Sir William Acworth had pointed out in a minority report that such assistance would amount to a subsidy against the Railway Companies, and that, as there was no reasonable prospect of the creation of additional traffic, railway receipts would be depleted and the Railway Companies might then demand increases in rates or other traffic to make good the deficiency. Something, however, has been effected. Tor example, the Nottingham Corporation, with the assistance of a grant from the Unemployment Grants Committee, have carried out an improvement scheme on the Trent at a cost of approximately  418,000, which enables vessels of 120 tons to ascend to Nottingham at all times of the year. In this connection attention is drawn to the inaccuracy of the statement in the pamphlet that &quot; barges of from 70 to 80 tons could be taken right from London round to Hull, but for a stretch of 22 miles between Nottingham and Hull, where the locks require widening.&quot; Barges of 120 tons can now navigate from Hull to Nottingham, the reconstruction of the locks on the Trent having been completed in 1926. The remainder of the route from Nottingham to London could be traversed by &quot; wide &quot; boats, such as are found on the Grand Junction
section of the Grand Union Canal Company&apos;s system, measuring from 10 to 11 feet beam and carrying a maximum of about 50 tons, were it not for one flight of locks at Watford on the Leicester section of the Grand Union system, which limit the width to 7 feet.4. It is early to form an accurate estimate of the advantages which will accrue through the improvement of the Trent.Owing to the favourable conditions prevailing on the Trent, the Corporation have been able to effect a very substantial improvement at an expenditure of less than half a million pounds. The position is much less favourable where the water-ways to be improved are artificial canals. The estimated cost of the scheme for improving the canal from Worcester to Birmingham so as to enable 100-ton barges to reach Birmingham from the Severn, instead of the present 30-40-ton barges, was stated to be over  2,500,000, while the cost of providing a similar improvement between Birmingham and the Mersey was estimated at over  6,500,000. In the case of the latter scheme the necessary annual expenditure of the proposed canal trust was estimated at  434,000 and it appeared that the greatly increased traffic necessary to render the scheme even a partial success would have to be diverted from the railways.These schemes for improving the waterways between Birmingham and the sea have formed the subject of lengthy negotiations between the Department and the Birmingham Corporation since the war, but there has been little evidence of strong local support, though the Department in 1924 offered a grant of one-third of the cost of the Birmingham-Severn scheme on certain conditions. The promoters of the scheme then diverted their attention to the more costly Mersey scheme and asked the Department to promote the necessary legislation to transfer the canal under-taking to a public - trust. Some of those undertakings belonged to the London Midland and Scottish Railway Company and efforts to secure their co-operation were unsuccessful.5. The Balfour Committee on Industry and Trade point out (on pages 67 and 68 of their report) that the situation with regard to canals has been greatly modified since the date of the Royal Commission^ investigations, and even since the Chamberlain Committee reported, by the rapid development which has occurred in road transport. Apart from canals worked in connection with ports, such as the Aire and Calder, the Bridgewater, the Grand Union, the Shropshire Union Canals, and the Trent Navigation, the Committee do not believe that canal traffic could be generally revived on a commercial basis so as to play a very substantial part in the transport facilities available to trade, and while canals such as those above named can be worked with great advantage to overseas trade, they consider that the configuration of the country is much less favourable to canal traffic than to the development of coastwise traffic from port to port; that the modernisation of canals for general internal traffic would be very costly and for the most part without prospect of the outlay being profitable.6. As already stated, one of the principal objections to contributions from the public towards the improvement of canals is that the improvement of a waterway in one locality, which resulted in substantial diversion of profitable traffic from the railways in that district, might, under the terms of the Railways Act, 1921, cause the railway rates in other parts of the country to be put up to meet the deficit, and it has been argued that it is unjust for the State to intervene to help one district at the expense of others.7. The improvements of the waterways forming &quot; the Cross,&quot; as recommended by the Royal Commission on Canals and Inland Waterways, would probably occupy from five to ten years. The total cost would be in the neighbourhood of  20,000,000, and the employment given would be approximately 12,300 men for&quot; five years or 6,150 men for ten years.8. It is obvious, however, that the greater part of the works could not be undertaken without statutory powers, which would also be required for the establish-ment of the public trusts recommended by Mr. Neville Chamberlain&apos;s Committee, and the transfer to them of the canal undertakings concerned.The proposals to be embodied in such legislation would have to be carefully considered in conjunction with the local bodies concerned, and the experience of the
previous negotiations regarding the Birmingham schemes indicates that difficulties would probably arise with the railway companies, who own several of the canals affected, and that such progress as would provide early unemployment relief could not be anticipated.9. Meanwhile, certain canal interests have taken steps to reorganise or amalgamate. On the 1st January, 1929, the Regents Canal, Grand Junction Canal &quot;Warwick and Napton Canal and Warwick and Birmingham Canal became merged, in one undertaking, under the name of the Grand Union Canal. By this amalgama-tion the waterway from London to Birmingham, with the exception of a short length of 5-1 miles belonging to the Oxford Canal, has been brought under unified control.Chapter XII. Land Settlement.(i.) Memorandum by Ministry of Agricuture.1. Less than forty lines are devoted to this subject in the pamphlet, and it would not, therefore, be reasonable to expect in so short a space sufficient particulars of the method which it is proposed to follow to admit of detailed examination.With most of the general statements that are made, anyone familiar with small holdings administration during the last 20 years will find himself in whole-hearted agreement. For instance, it is pointed out, after reference to settlement overseas, that &quot; we should not overlook the preferable alternative of settling them, where possible, on the land of Britain.&apos;&apos; Again, &quot;there will be no difficulty in finding willing settlers.&quot;   Such statements as these are obviously not open to criticism.2. It may be desirable to examine the reasons for the alleged failure of the Act of 1926, as this will make a useful starting point for a brief consideration of the scheme put forward in the phamplet.There are three principal reasons to account for the comparative small area of additional land which has been acquired by local authorities under the Act of 1926. These three reasons, in order of importance, are (a.) The noticeable change in the attitude of local authorities and of applicantsduring the last four or five years on account of agricultural depression; (b.) The financial conditions embodied in the Act; and (c.) The administrative arrangements laid down by the Act.Of these three reasons, (a) is a great deal more important than (b) and (c) put together. It will, however, be convenient to consider (5) and (c) first.3. Finance. Agricultural landowners, speaking generally, do not derive more than, say, a net 3 per cent, on the capital value of their agricultural properties. A County Council owning small holding estates cannot be expected to obtain on the average a larger net return. If it is necessary, in order to purchase such properties, to borrow money, say from the Public Works Loan Commissioners at 5 per cent, repayable over a period of years, it is obvious that the Council cannot balance its accounts.   The deficiency is usually spoken of as a loss.An example may possibly help to explain the character and extent of such loss. Assume, for simplicity, that a property which consists only of bare land, is purchased by a Council. Assume that the purchase price ( 2,000) is true market value. Assume also that the property can be sub-divided and let in small holdings without any further capital expenditure after purchase. As in a case of this kind there is no need to make any provision for Ihe maintenance or insurance of buildings, it may be that the Council will derive a net return of, say, 4 per cent., instead of the average 3 per cent, referred to in the previous paragraph. On these assumptions, the Councils accounts for the next 80 years in regard to this property would, under present circumstances, read as follows :- -    5.  d.Loan charges on  2,000 for 80 years at 5 per cent.,including sinking fund ... ... ...      101 19   3 p.a.Net rental after paying for management, say ...        80   0   0 p.a.Annual Loss      ... ... ... ...        21 19   3 p.a.
It will be obvious that if dwelling houses have to be erected on the land in order to render it available for small-holders, or additional farm buildings have to be provided, the loss is thereby increased.So long as the rate of interest on public loans (which is based on the commercial value of money) exceeds the net annual return to be obtained from the ownership of agricultural land, so long will there be an inevitable deficit on small-holdings schemes. Such losses did not occur before the War, when the rate of interest was 3^ per &quot;cent., as compared with 5 per cent, at the present time, and it was then possible to acquire specially selected properties which, when sub-divided, would bring in a net return sufficient to cover loan charges.4. The pamphlet gives no indication as to how the authors intend to overcome the financial difficulty to which reference has just been made. It is not, however, unreasonable to assume that their policy is based on the detailed programme contained in the &quot;The Land and the Nation.&quot; The scheme developed in detail in this latter volume would overcome the difficulty referred to by transferring part, at any rate, of the loss to the present owners of agricultural land, for the scheme proposes to acquire agricultural land on the basis, not of its capital value in the open market, but in return for annual payments based, broadly speaking, on not more than the net annual return which the owners at the date of acquisition are receiving. Quite clearly this proposal overcomes many difficulties. There will be no capital money to raise, consequently no loans, and the rate of interest on public loans would cease to influence the annual accounts of a local authority in respect of acquisitions under the scheme.So far as can be judged in advance, the success of their scheme would very largely depend on whether all agricultural land was to be taken over by public authorities on the basis above described, or whether only such areas as are required for public purposes. It is probable that some local authorities would decline to acquire selected areas on this basis on the ground that the owners of such areas were being prejudicially treated as compared with other owners left free to sell land on more favourable terms in the open market. In this connection it should be observed that the risk of acquisition on the terms advocated would depress values generally.5. If new houses and new farm buildings are required and no large scheme of land settlement can be carried through without employing a builder so far as can be seen at the present time it will be necessary to defray building expenditure by means of capital loans. If this proves to be so, then a financial loss must result, because, in the same way as with land, the rental value of a small house or small farm building is not equivalent to the loan charges based on the capital cost. Here, again, the position was different before the War, when operations under the Act of 1908 were very successful. A cottage which then cost  200 now costs  500. The loan charges on  200 for 50 years at 3^ per cent, were  8 10s. (id. per annum. Although the loan period has now been extended, the increased rate of interest, taken with the increased cost, makes a very different story. The annual loan charges on  500 for 60 years at 5 per cent, are equivalent to  26 7s. 3d. On the other hand, the rental value has no doubt increased from, say,  10 before the War, to  15 now. So far as can be seen, this question of loss resulting from capital expenditure on building operations has not up till now been discussed in any of the publications under review. The erection of new houses was, however, a real stumbling block even under the Act of 1908, and in fact only 744 new houses were provided for the 14,000 small holdings created in 1908-14. Many of the holdings not then provided with dwelling houses could not now be cultivated as small holdings if houses had not since been erected at a loss to public funds.6. Administration. The Act of 1908 placed the administration of small holdings schemes upon county councils and councils of county boroughs. This arrangement has been continued by the Act of 1919 and the Act of 1926. It was, however, one thing; to ask local authorities to undertake work of this kind when there was no financial loss; it is an entirely different matter to expect them to carry out such schemes when a financial loss is inevitable. The 1919 Act, while continuing to charge local authorities with the administration, placed the whole financial responsibility on the Exchequer. This no doubt was necessary and justifiable as a post-War emergency measure. It cannot be contemplated, however, as a permanent administrative system. Administration without any financial responsibility leads to gross extravagance, and is in many other respects extremely undesirable. The Act of 1926 consequently placed upon the Exchequer responsibility for only 75 per cent.
of approved loss. There can be little doubt that responsibility for the remaining 25 per cent, is acting as a deterrent in the case of some local authorities, although not all.7. Reduction of Demand. There has been a most noticeable falling off in the persistent demand of applicants for small holdings during the last four or five years. The explanation is no doubt the depressed state of the industry, coupled with the extensive publicity given to such depression. All small holdings legislation in this country has been based on demand. In the absence of demand, the machinery does not start to operate. It will be readily understood that local authorities, unless pressed by an insistent demand, will not acquire new properties and thus incur deficits, part of which have to be met from local funds, the remainder being met from the Exchequer. The depressed state of the industry has made local authorities reluctant to incur new commitments, while also making potential applicants more ready to accept the position that little or nothing is being done.The pamphlet states that &quot; there will be no difficulty in finding willing settlers.&quot; This is absolutely true. Experience, even during the last four or five years, has shown that whenever a good small holding becomes vacant six or seven thoroughly suitable applicants apply for it. There is a strong case for founding a small holding policy on an entirely new conception. It would be in the national interest to acquire and sub-divide many existing farming units into smaller units (not necessarily within the limits of a statutory small holding), and if this were done there would be no shortage of applicants for the sub-divided holdings, nor is there any doubt that over a period of years agricultural production would be increased. The difficulty which has prevented the launching of a scheme of this kind has been chiefly financial.8. Land Settlement for Surplus Miners.- The short statement with regard to land settlement in the pamphlet concludes with a reference to the problem of surplus coal-miners, and indicates that small holdings could afford a minor, but immediate and permanent, contribution towards the solution of the unemployment problem. There can be no doubt as to the truth of this statement, but again, the problem is chiefly financial. So far there has been no attempt made in this country to provide with small holdings men who have had but little experience of agriculture and were at the same time entirely without capital. It would appear to be prudent to attempt any such experiment on a comparatively small scale at any rate, to start with. For this reason the Ministry of Agriculture has put forward at various times pro-posals for the provision of small holdings for surplus miners. So far such schemes have not been approved, partly on financial grounds, and partly because legislation would be required and Parliamentary time is not available before the General Election.9. To some extent the success of an experiment of the kind contemplated must depend upon the magnitude on which it is carried out. Existing machinery could, for example, easily undertake the acquisition and equipment of, say, 200 holdings per annum, and it is practically certain that suitable surplus miners could be found for such holdings and carefully nursed during the first few years until they were firmly on their feet. It is obviously a very different problem to deal with, say, 20,000 men per annum. A great deal of the admitted extravagance of the scheme for the land settlement of ex-Service men was due to the attempt which was made in 1929 to obtain results before an adequate organisation had been set up comprising skilled and experienced men throughout the country. It would be fatal to repeat this mistake in connection with a scheme for the provision of holdings for ex-miners.10. The estimated cost of a small scheme for the settlement of surplus miners would, of course, be materially affected by the adoption of the programme referred to above for the acquisition of land. Even &quot;so, it would be necessary to provide capital moneys for the equipment of land and for farming capital. If the latter sum could be regarded as the equivalent of unemployment benefit spread over a period of years, it would no doubt be possible to show that the cost of the scheme would be limited to the loss resulting from building operations. The Ministry of Agriculture&apos;s enquiries in this connection indicate that, if Parliament were prepared to entrust the Department with the direct administration of an experimental scheme for the provision of land for ex-miners, it would be practicable to carry through such a scheme on the basis of 200 men to be settled per annum at a capital cost averaging, say,  1,200 per family, of which approximately  300 would be lent to the settler[19066J i
for farming capital. This estimate has been framed on the assumption that on the average 150 men would be provided with land in the immediate neighbourhood of their own homes and only 50 would have to be transferred to holdings including a dwelling-house.11.   The pamphlet (page 50) states: &quot;During the past year members of the Society of Friends have been responsible for providing about 20,000 allotments for miners in South Wales, and about 20,000 in Durham and Northumberland. From their experience, they have come definitely to the conclusion that miners are particularly adapted for work on the land, and that many of them would make admirable smallholders.&quot;There can be no question as to the value of the work which is being undertaken by the Society of Friends, especially in South Wales. The Society has aimed &quot;principally at maintaining the cultivation of land already devoted to allotments. Owing to the distressed condition of mining areas, some of this land (and in certain districts a large proportion) was falling out of cultivation because the allot-ment holder could not find the money for rent, nor for seeds, manures, &amp;c. This rather than the provision of allotments has been the problem which the Society of Friends has tackled with marked success. There is no questioning that many miners are admirably suited to work on the land. There is, however, a big gap between an allotment and a small holding which will provide a complete livelihood for its occupier. If a miner is surplus to the requirements of his industry, and is to be converted into a small holder, it appears to be necessary to provide him with sufficient land to enable him, when he has gained the necessary experience, to earn from such land a sufficient livelihood for himself and his family. It is very unlikely that any large proportion of the 20,000 allotment holders in South Wales and the 20,000 in Durham and Northumberland, for whom the Society of Friends have been working, can have shown qualities which would enable them to cultivate successfully small holdings unless it is to be contemplated that they should be provided with close supervision and technical assistance as well as with adequate farming capital.(ii.^-Memorandum by Board of Agriculture, Scotland.General Remarks.1. The paragraph headed&apos;&apos; Land Settlement&apos;&apos; is apparently intended to suggest that Land Settlement offers to the solution of the unemployment problem an immediate contribution which is substantial and is also inexpensive if the Pledge &quot; No addition to National or Local Taxation &quot; is to be regarded as applicable.So far at least as Scotland is concerned, this is not the case. The figures on page 49 of the Report are subjected to observations in detail below. But if the reference to &quot;over 10,000 unsatisfied applicants for small holdings &quot; followed by the reference to &quot;over 1,750,000 acres of land available for small holdings&apos;&apos; in the Highlands and Islands alone is intended to suggest the feasibility of early settlement of some thousands of small holders and substantial relief to unemployment, the suggestion is not well founded. Land Settlement in Scotland must be carried but gradually, because the land which is suitable is limited in amount, and unless the suitable farms are to be taken and broken up during the currency of leases regardless of the cost of compensation, the suitable land in a given district only becomes available gradually as long leases expire. After the land is acquired, its division and equipment with roads, buildings, &amp;c, may take a considerable period.As regards cost, each small holder settled represents an average outlay of considerable amount, of which a substantial proportion has to be borne by the taxpayer as a direct or indirect subsidy.In short, Land Settlement, desirable as it is on other grounds, has little bearing on the problem of unemployment. As a proposed remedy for unemployment it is neither substantial, quick nor inexpensive.Detailed Remarks.2. &quot;In Scotland, at the end of 1926, there were over 10,000 unsatisfied applicants for small holdings, of whom only 138 were dealt with in the following year&quot; (Pamphlet, page 49).
(1.) Applications. The figures given cover a number of ineffective applications held on the lists at the end of 1926. Revision at the end of 1928 reduces the number of outstanding applications to 7,332, and of these 517 are now to be classed as ineffective, and many others will prove to be so on various grounds, e.g., emigration.(2.) Settlement.-Applicants settled since the commencement of the Small Landholders (Scotland) Act, 1911, up to the end of 1928 number 5,123, for whom a total area of 564,872 acres has been made available. Schemes presently in hand are expected to provide for 194 applicants during the current year. Other schemes will be added to programme if opportunity offers. Current arrangements permit new commitment at the rate of  130,000 per annum, which will allow provision to be made for some 200 applicants yearly.3. &quot; Yet in 1895 a Royal Commission reported that in the Highlands and Islands alone there were over 1,750,000 acres of land available for small holdings&quot; (page 49).This statement must be considerably qualified in view of the actual terms of the Report of the Commission.The total area of land scheduled by the Commission was 1,782,785  acres,classified as follows : Acres. Per cent.Old Arable       ...          ...         ...          61,023 3-4Pasture            ...          ...          ...       1,721,762 96-61,782,785 100-0The land scheduled is also classified by the Commission as follows : Acres.Suitable for new holdings ... ... ...        794,750Suitable for extension of existing holdings ...        439,188Suitable for moderate-sized farms        ... ...        548,847Total      ... ... ...     1,782,785The land scheduled in each of these categories includes both &quot;old arable&quot; and pasture. The Commission state that the land scheduled as available for new holdings in all cases &quot; includes large areas of old arable land formerly cultivated, but presently under grass, or is land capable of being reclaimed and surrounded or bordered by grazing lands adapted for cattle or sheep stock, or both.&quot;The area scheduled as &quot;old arable&quot; constitutes, as shown above, only 3-4 per cent, of the total scheduled area. The area of land &quot;capable of being reclaimed &quot; is not stated. The remainder, described as &quot;pasture,&quot; is mainly rough hill-land capable of carrying sheep stock at the rate of 5 acres or more per ewe.4. It is thus obvious that the scope for the constitution of new small holdings of arable land is restricted to a small proportion of the land scheduled by the Commission.Much of the land so scheduled has been included in the land-settlement schemes carried out by the Department, either in the form of new settlements or in that of the enlargement of existing holdings. The pasture land as a rule continues to carry approximately the same stock of sheep (or its equivalent in heavy stock) as it carried when forming large pastoral farms, the difference being that it is on the property of groups of small landholders, the transfer having been carried out by means of loans made by the Department.To state that If million acres of land were available for &quot; small holdings &quot; in 1895, implying that this vast area is still available for &quot;small holdings &quot; in the guise of arable holdings conveys an entirely false impression of the actual condition of the Highlands and Islands.5. The Royal Commission^ report of 1895 was followed by the erection of the Congested Districts Board in 1897. Before demitting office that Board had formed 640 new holdings and 1,138 enlargements, a total of 1,778, the area of operations being 133,000 acres. The Board of Agriculture for Scotland took over the functions of the Congested Districts Board in 1912, and have since given entry to 2,059 new holders and 1,680 applicants for enlargements on 525,650 acres in the Highlands and Islands.   Thus it will appear that the total area made available in&quot;the Highlands
and Islands since 1895 amounts to 660,000 acres approximately. Schemes to which the Department are committed will absorb a further 33,000 acres. Subdivision has gone so far in the Long Island that it is doubtful if there would be real public advantage in subdividing the few remaining agricultural subjects which exceed  80 in yearly rent. Lewis has only 3 such farms, Harris 3, North Uist 2, South Uist 0, and Barra 1, though that is only 31 acres in extent. Besides, some of these farms being Home Farms are barred from the operation of the Small Landholders (Scotland) Acts except by agreement. The Deer forests, of which there are 8, do^ not offer scope for any considerable land settlement. In the whole of Skye there are now left only 19 farms rented at more than  80, and several of these are not available for compulsory subdivision. It may be added that the Congested Districts Board and the Department of Agriculture have occasioned the subdivision of half the area of Skye.6. &quot; The steady disappearance of the Scottish crofter and the turning of Northern Scotland into a rich man&apos;s game preserve have meant an incalculable loss to the nation, not only in food production, but in its finest asset, its manhood &quot; (pp. 49 and 50).

Fully four-fifths of this decrease took place in the period between 1911 and 1921, which included the war years.

7. &quot; During the past year members of the Society of Friends .... Agricultural Workers &quot; (page 50).Owing to the existence of leases, the necessity for the completion of negotiations and for statutory procedure, and the subsequent need for the erection of buildings and other equipment, there is no quick remedy for distress, arising out of unemployment, in the provision of small holdings under existing enactments. Help might sooner reach distressed and unemployed miners by making available, at each miners&apos; village or row, a field for allotments.By the provisions of the Allotments Acts, Town Councils and Parish Councils have certain duties and powers to make land available to meet any demand existing in their areas for the provision of allotments. By the Allotments (Scotland) Act, 1926, they are empowered to levy a rate not exceeding Id. in the   to meet expenditure in carrying out these duties; and by Section 22 (1) of Part III of the Land Settlement (Scotland) Act, 1919, they are empowered to purchase seeds, plants and fertilisers for resale to cultivators of allotments, and also to supply implements on hire.8. In a circular letter dated the 31st January, 1929, and addressed to Parish Councils in the distressed mining areas, the Department recommended that in the existing industrial circumstances, the cultivation of allotment ground might usefully be considered as a means of alleviating distress. This suggestion has also been discussed by the Department with the Scottish National Union of Allotment Holders, who have ascertained that the encouragement of cultivation of allotments by miners is held to be a purpose coming within the scope of the Miners&apos; Welfare Fund, and who have suggested to the Scottish District Committees administering that Fund that joint action might be taken by the Union and the Committees to promote an extension of allotments in the mining areas. The Department have also communicated with the District Committees urging that the Union&apos;s suggestion should be favourably considered.Chapter XIII.

The mam programme, excluding the subsidiary schemes which are referred to in the pamphlet, appears, therefore, to involve an additional capital expenditure in each of the next two years of at least  125 million.2. Proposals for Financing Expenditure.So far as the financing of the proposals is concerned, it is proposed in the pamphlet that the expenditure on road schemes should be met from a road loan secured upon the growing income of the Road Fund. The capital required by local authorities for housing purposes is to be raised &quot; as in recent years &quot; (p. 33). &apos; This, presumably, means that a large proportion would be directly provided on Government credit by the Public Works Loan Board. Telephone capital would continue to be raised by the State by borrowing. The capital for the other items is presumably intended to be raised by local authorities or private bodies, although as regards drainage it is stated that the cost must be largely at the public expense, and it seems highly improbable that large further sums could be raised by local authorities for any purpose without Government guarantees. It may be assumed that, if the work is to be pushed ahead on the scale proposed in the pamphlet, the great bulk of the  125 millions a year will have to be borrowed, directly or indirectly, on Government credit. It is estimated that the present commitments for Local Loans, &amp;c, will involve the Government raising from the market during the coming year a net sum of approximately  20 millions, which would be increased by any capital which would have to be raised on Government guarantee, for electricity development.3. The Basic Argument for the Plan.Now it is common ground between all parties that the State is responsible for ensuring that public services such as Roads, Telephones, Housing, &amp;c, are main-tained and developed to the fullest extent that can be justified by our economic needs, without extravagance. During the last four years there has been provided  73 millions for Roads,  48 millions for Telephone capital expenditure, and  133 millions for Local Loans, mainly Housing, &amp;c. The scale of State capital expenditure is therefore not a question of principle, but of degree. The view hitherto followed has been that State expenditure should be framed with due regard to other competing calls on our national capital resources, and that, as the natural test of profit-making capacity was absent, the economic justification of all schemes ought to be very thoroughly examined before they are put in hand.The proposals in the pamphlet are based on a much more liberal conception of the economic conditions that should be satisfied by State expenditure. Their root proposition is that the State should deliberately expedite and put in hand large additional development schemes which are not yet economically justified in order to bring about a reduction in unemployment. This involves a question of fact (not dealt with in this Memorandum) whether these particular schemes would give the amount of employment claimed. It involves the further question whether the financial reactions of the scheme would diminish employment in other directions.It is fundamental that the capital required must be raised without resort to inflation. As the pamphlet says (p. 62), !i inflation, whilst it would temporarily solve our problem, would mean the departure from the gold standard, a reduction in the real standard of life of those at present employed and the grave risk of economic collapse in the long run.   It can be entirely ruled out.&quot;The case in the pamphlet is substantially that though our national savings are generally adequate, sufficient outlet is not provided for them in the form of capital investment at home. It is claimed that by increasing Government borrowing for capital expenditure in each of the next two years employment would be improved, without set-off in the form of diminished employment elsewhere in the country due to the diversion of savings from other home enterprises to these particular plans. It is argued that the additional capital required, which we have seen is roughly  125 in each of the next two years, can be raised out of savings which are not now actively employed, or by withdrawing money from foreign investment, and in either case without depriving British industry of its present resources.4. Examination of Statistics of New Capital Issues.Let us examine, first of all. the volume of capital savings out of which this expenditure will have to be financed.   The following table shows the new issues on
the London market during the years 1910-13 and again during the years 1925-28 The figures are taken from tables compiled by the &quot;Economist,&quot; except that the &quot;Economist &quot; figures for post-war years treat as new cash issues British Govern-ment loans, which were used, in fact, to redeem existing debt and which should therefore be excluded, while, on the other hand, the &quot; Economist &quot; has ignored British Government borrowing from the National Debt Commissioners for local loans telephones, &amp;c, which should be included, and the figures in the table below have been corrected on these points.New Capital Issues on the London Market.( 000,000 omitted.)

It might be claimed that some of the money shown as home investment was in reality intended for investment abroad, e.g., part of the subscriptions to new &quot; Investment Trusts.&apos;&apos; This could hardly account for :is much as  15 millions a year, and aeainst it must be set the fact that much of the investment abroad was merely reinvestment of maturing loans paid off in cash.
5. Estimates of Total Savings.New issues are not of course the only channel by which new savings are absorbed. For instance, an appreciable proportion of total savings is applied to capital developments without any new issue by means of Companies&apos; reserve funds. The estimates of our total national savings before the War centre generally round a figure of  380 millions a year, which was generally thought to be applied as to  190 millions to Home development and as to  190 millions to Colonial and Foreign Loans. Translated into terms of the present-day value of money this would mean about  325 millions a year for home investment and  325 millions a year for investment abroad, i.e., a total of  650 millions. As has been pointed out by the Colwyn Committee, there has been a substantial falling off in the national savings since the War, which may be estimated as equivalent to  150 millions or  200 millions at present-day prices. The present figure for savings is generally put at about  450 millions, and that figure has been divided roughly into Home investments  330 millions and Foreign and Colonial investments  120 millions.   So we have 	Four pre-war Years.		Last four Years.	After plan in the Pamphlet.	At pre-war Prices.	At present Prices.	1925-28.

Movements of Capital.The figures of national savings are, at best, only estimates, and it should not be inferred that the statistics of new capital issues are regarded as representing the total volume of our foreign investment. On the contrary, the capital issues publicly floated in the market form only a small proportion of the total capital transactions which take place between this country and abroad. The statistics of market issues give no indication of the large movements of funds which take place every day, both for long-term investment in existing market securities and for short-term invest-ment in bills, or even as day-to-day money between the different financial centres, particularly between London and New York. It is quite impossible to estimate the volume of these capital transactions, and their tendency and effect can only be gauged by the discount rates and by the state of the Exchanges. Judging by these criteria, there is every reason to believe that America last Spring was, on balance, investing in this country, while during the past six months the opposite has been the case, and large amounts of money have been remitted from this country to America, not only in settlement of American claims, but in order to join in the American stock exchange speculation or to take advantage of the high rates offered by the American stock exchange for time or call loans.This flow of capital to America can only be checked by an increase in the discount rates prevailing in London or by a reduction in the market rates for money in New York; but the movement is, in all probability, a temporary one, and once the present boom in the American stock market comes to an end, it may be anticipated that much of the capital temporarily invested in America will be withdrawn and our exchanges will benefit correspondingly.7. Frozen Savings.In an attempt to show that there are large sums available for investment, the pamphlet (pages 54 and 55) draws attention to some figures quoted recently by Mr. McKenna in an address to the shareholders of the Midland Bank which indicate a growth in the ratio of time deposits to demand deposits. His figures are per-centages ; we cannot analyse them to see to whom these balances belong or what their volume is, nor do we know how far his results are parallel to those of other Joint-Stock banks.There is usually some tendency, when business is slack, for money to hang in the banks, particularly on time deposit, which is the most paying form of bank
deposit. A great part of this money is the loose cash of manufacturing concerns, which in a depression they do not employ for the moment, but which they wish to keep liquid and could not in any circumstances put in long-term investments. A further large part is constituted by balances belonging to foreign Banks and institu-tions, which at the present moment have enormous claims on this country and probably keep a proportion on time deposit. A further possible source of such deposits is, perhaps, to be found in the growth in recent years of banking habits on the part of the less wealthy part of population and in the successful efforts of the Joint-Stock banks to attract small tradesmen, &amp;c, as depositors. Some of these may be beginning to realise the greater advantage of time deposits when interest rates are high.The bulk of the funds in question can, owing to the requirements of the holders, not be employed in long-term investments, and to the extent that they accumulate, they do represent a slackening in the circulation of money and in employment. But while held by the Banks, they are, of course, by no means idle, as indeed the pamphlet admits. &quot;Nor is it suggested that the money on deposit is not being used at all; it is, in fact, used by the banks in loans to the money market and in s&apos;hort-term investments &quot; (page 55). The admission thus made does not state the facts fully. The money may be used in commercial advances or credits and in taking up bills or acceptances for traders as well as in loans to the short-term money market; indeed at a later point in his speech Mr. McKenna was at great pains to emphasize the very high proportion of his loans which represent part of the necessary equipment of production and trade and the negligible proportion available for undertakings operating abroad or for money market and speculative purposes. There is no means of saying whether an increase in the proportion of time deposits leads to a corresponding increase in the period for which bank advances are made. Such a result would not be unnatural, but broadly speaking it is true enough that money lent to the banks on time deposit is used by the banks to grant short-term advances or credits. It is a far cry from this&apos; proposition to the light-hearted assumption that the issue of further Government securities would suffice to attract this money from time deposit into long-term investment. As indicated above, a large proportion of time deposits have of necessity to be kept liquid; and it is very doubtful for the reasons given in the next paragraph whether even the balance could be attracted into Government loans.8. Diversion of Savings from Home Enterprise.The contention of the pamphlet is that the additional  125 millions a year required for new State or local authority borrowing can be found without impinging on the supply of capital for other home requirements.This, on the face of it, appears to be highly improbable. There is not the least reason to suppose that works under Government auspices would be more remunera-tive or have more success in attracting capital than any other works. They have the special drawback that the money would have to be attracted by the issue of Government stock, of which there is already a plethora in the market. If large new loans are floated on &quot; gilt-edged &quot; terms, the higher rates of interest paid by foreign countries and the Dominions, both for short-term and for long-term money, would remain just as attractive to the investor as at present. There can be no presumption that, given a free market, the volume of British money going abroad would be substantially reduced; we obviously cannot compete with the temptations offered by the capital appreciation of the American share market or with the 8 per cent, time and 12 per cent, call rate which it offers for brokers&apos; loans. Mr. Keynes, in his article in the &quot; Evening Standard,&quot; frankly admits that &quot; it will be necessary to offer a rate of interest which will compete with foreign borrowers.&quot; Thus the prospect before the British citizen is a marked increase in the rate of interest on Government borrowings, not only on these new borrowings, but on the  SO or  40 millions per annum normal borrowings for Local Loans and Telephone capital expenditure, on the  700 millions of Treasury Bills outstanding and on the other borrowings required to deal with war debt maturities amounting to  322 millions in the next four years. And the prospect of reducing the interest on the 5 per Cent. War Loan would be indefinitely postponed. There would clearly also be very serious reaction on the rate at which Local Authorities and British industry could raise money and a consequent disturbance of trade aiid employment. We can, in fact, only prevent funds going abroad by offering the inducement of higher rates at home, and the harm that suchhigher rates would inflict on trade and employment [19066] K
. would certainly counterbalance any benefit they got from diverting funds from foreign to home investment.To this prospect there is no alternative, under the plan in the pamphlet, unless it is intended to impose a drastic control over the direction of investment. Apart from the irritation caused, such an attempt would certainly prove futile. How, in fact, without postal censorship, such as was imposed under D.O.R.A. Regulations, is it possible to ensure that the private citizen does not invest abroad ? It would have little effect to stop new foreign issues in London while the whole field of existing foreign securities is open to the investor. The chief result of any such attempt would be to make London lose the commissions on foreign loans, to the benefit of foreign commercial centres.The Balfour Committee considered the question in their Final Report (page 45) and stated that they were not prepared to recommend any general restriction on the amount of capital exported, and that, in their view, the &quot; disadvantages which would result from any attempt to control or direct the flow &quot; of capital investment &quot; would outweigh the advantages.&quot;9. Effect of Plan, if Successful, on Export Trade.It seems clear that in these circumstances a very large proportion of any additional Government borrowings can only be procured, without inflation, by diverting money which otherwise would be taken soon by home industry. That being so, the prospects of adding largely by the means suggested to the existing volume of employment practically disappear. Assuming, however, that it were possible, under the plan to secure for home development funds at present going abroad, what would be the result on the different classes of British industry ? It would stimulate internal consumption and tend to raise the level of wages and prices; and it would encourage imports and make things more difficult for the export trades* which are most susceptible to the competition of foreign goods. These industries have been developed on the basis of large loans being granted by this country for capital development purposes abroad, and their main difficulty has been to secure the necessary orders from their foreign customers. The additional work that they might put in hand for bridges, &amp;o, at home would be a poor substitute for the construction contracts of whole railways in foreign countries which they would have to forfeit. Admittedly, in the exceptional economic circumstances of the present time, these arguments must not be over-stressed, but the reactions to which they draw attention should not be overlooked.This difficulty is ignored in the pamphlet, but in newspaper controversy Mr. Keynes has recently developed a new theory that in fact the investment of capital abroad has but slight relation to the export of British goods. It has hitherto been generally assumed that, apart from temporary maladjustments, the export of capital must ultimately be liquidated by the export of goods, and it is beyond question that the export of capital in the past by this country has led, both directly and indirectly, to the development of our export trade abroad. This being so, one would naturally expect that a great decline in the export of British capital must ultimately result in a decrease in our exports or an increase of imports. Mr. Keynes, however, asserts that the result of the export of capital is an increase in the export of goods to an extent not exceeding, say, 20 per cent, of the capital exported. He does not, however, support this view by any detailed argument; and until he does so, it seems unnecessary to argue the matter. It is for him to prove his case. On the ordinary view there is an intimate relation between the export of capital and of goods. If the plan were successful in diverting money from investment abroad that change would be accompanied by a great decrease in our exports or increase in imports, either of these things being highly prejudicial to important branches of industry.* Note.-Cf. the description in Cunniugham&apos;s &quot; Growth of British Industry and Commerce,&quot; Part II, p. 829, of the situation.following the Railway construction boom in the forties of last century: The extraordinary expenditure at home inn eases very much the consumption of all commodities, both of foreign import and home production and raises their price, as is the case at this time. The high price of foreign commodities induces to a large importation; the high price and home demand for domestic produce cause a decreased export. The exchanges are thus turned against us, and we must remit&apos;money for the payment of that balance created by the use of those foreign commodities consumed in this country by those, no part of whose produce had be6n exported to represent their consumption. One of the most certain symptoms that can be shown of an undue absorption of capital going forward in internal investments, is when we see our imports increasing more rapidly than our exports, or when the former are increasing and the latter are diminishing.
10. Costs of Production the Root of the Problem.The fact is that from whatever angle one looks at the unemployment problem, one is always forced to the conclusion that the principal (though not, of course, the only) cause of our difficulties is to be found in the fact that in many branches particularly of our heavy industries our costs of production -&quot;(turning upon organisation and efficiency both of capital and of labour) still tend to be excessive, and that these difficulties cannot be solved till these costs have been placed on a competitive level. If Mr. McKenna is right that time deposits are growing excessively, the main reason is probably that our costs of production keep orders away, and in default of orders our manufacturers are either unable or unwilling to replace their plant or build up for fresh develop-ments. But if this is the main source of our difficulties, the loan programme of the pamphlet would do nothing to remove it and if it led to a rise in our internal price level, or prevented a fall, it might in the long run make matters worse. At the very highest, any scheme of this kind is but a palliative, which would produce only a temporary improvement. The ultimate remedy for unemployment is not to be found in such measures. It must be solved by reducing the costs of production by improved organisation and efficiency both of capital and of labour and adjusting the industries of the country to the changes that have taken place in world demands and in the supplies from different countries, and by improving our selling methods. This fact is generally recognised by economists and it is probable that Mr. Keynes would admit that the proposed loan programme can only give a temporary fillip to industry. He would justify its adoption on the ground that if we can only tide over the next few years, the tendency for things to right themselves, by the bridging of the gaps between our costs and those of our foreign competitors, where this is needful, and in other ways, will be given time to operate. However, the period may not be sufficient and we cannot rely with any certainty on a steady and progressive increase in Continental costs. In the meanwhile the procedure proposed in the pamphlet tends to encourage British industry and labour in false hopes and thereby prevents the steps from being taken which would lead to recovery so that it might ultimately make our position worse and necessitate a much more drastic revision of our standards of livelihood than is called for to-day11. To sum up, we have always pursued the policy of providing the finance required for the economic development of the public services, and there is no justifica-tion for the charge that these services have been stinted. The proposals in the pamphlet that this programme should be greatly extended are open to very serious objection on financial ground. The large loans involved, if they are not to involve inflation, must draw on existing capital resources. These resources are on the whole utilised at present in varying degrees of active employment; and the great bulk is utilised for home industrial and commercial purposes. The extent to which any additional employment could be given by altering the direction of investment is therefore at the best strictly limited. But the direction of investment can only be altered if we are prepared to offer sufficiently high money rates to counteract the attractions offered, e.g., in America. If, however, we do so, the damage done to home trade and employment by. the imposition of such high rates would undoubtedly be much greater than any benefit they could obtain from the funds that could thereby be diverted from foreign investment. Moreover, this procedure would, of course, mean the restriction which might be serious of the development loans for the Dominions, as well as for foreign countries, on which our heavy industries have in the past largely depended for custom. Meanwhile, the issue of large additional Government loans, at an attractive rate of interest, would undoubtedly add to the costs of all Government borrowings and impose therefore an extra charge (or prevent economies being realised) on the Budget. Although the maintenance of Government credit and the cheapening of Government borrowings may not be of paramount importance as against the social advantages of reducing unemployment (if it could be reduced by such means) there is no justification for depressing Government credit if (as seems to be the case) no great addition to employment could thereby be procured. It must be remembered that an increase in the cost of Government borrowings automatically increases the costs of borrowing for all public authorities, and eventually for private enterprise, too. Finally, on the long view, the undertaking of a large programme of Government expenditure, if it were successful in increasing employment temporarily, would tend to prejudice our export trades by encouraging our industries to struggle along on an uneconomic basis instead of reorganising them-selves to meet present-day conditions.
as12. Test of Schemes of State Expenditure.Roads and Telephones are instruments of industry and their development may promote its efficiency. But they are also luxuries and may be merely symptoms of accumulated wealth and means of spending it. A great deal of the proposed expenditure on Roads, so far as it would serve any immediate purpose at all, would merely afford more luxurious facilities for pleasure traffic, and a great deal of the proposed expenditure on Telephones would merely provide additional social amenities.Some expenditure on Land Drainage is, of course, necessary work of main-tenance, but past experience suggests that ambitious schemes for an expenditure of from  12 to  15 millions on Reclamation and Drainage could not possibly yield any commensurate return. It may be felt that a large scheme for reclamation on the Wash combined with drainage of the Ouse might be advantageous, but detailed figures of the expenditure involved and of the estimated probable return would be necessary to show whether such a project could be regarded as an economic one.Land Settlement and Afforestation, whatever may be said for these policies on social and political grounds, have no serious bearing on the problem of unemploy-ment. It is not sufficient to say that production would be increased by these projects; it is necessary to show that the increase would be enough to yield an economic return on the capital outlay. Land Settlement is admittedly uneconomic. At least half the capital expended is lost. As from  1,200 to  2,000 is required to settle each smallholder, the cost of dealing with any considerable number of men is obviously prohibitive.In the case of afforestation, experts do not themselves claim more than a return of 3-1 per cent, on about 60 per cent, of the expenditure, and even this is not received for upwards of 50 years. The rest of the expenditure, including the cost of providing Forest holdings, yields little or no return.It is suggested that all the schemes should be tested by the broad criterion whether they are likely to increase the efficiency of industry and enable it to lower its costs of production and increase its output, especially in the export trades. Seeing that the national savings are less, allowing for the altered level of prices, than before the war, and capital is therefore comparatively scarce and dear, it follows that we cannot afford investments which yield only an uneconomic, or a very distant, return, or are of a purely luxury nature. Judged by this test, it is difficult to believe that the greater part of the expenditure proposed would increase the power of industry to provide remunerative employment.
PART III. MEMORANDA ON MELCHETT-TILLETT REPORT.Chapter XIY. Recommendations 1 and 8, and certain other Points affectingPensions and Insurance Funds.(i.) Memorandum by the Government Actuary, the Ministry of Health and theMinistry of Labour.I. Augmented Pensions at 65.1. Amount and Effect of Increase. It is difficult to say what increase of pension would induce any considerable number of men to retire from employment. There is no indication that the existing pensions of 10s. a week (or  1 to those with wives over 65), which have been in operation since January 1928, have led to any widespread withdrawal from the labour market, and the number of persons over 65 still employed in industry (including agriculture, but not private domestic service) has recently been estimated officially at 340,000. Whether an additional grant of (say) 10s. a week would have the desired effect is problematical. The Report appears to contemplate that the grant from the State would be supplemented by private pension schemes set up in certain industries or by individual employers within those industries, if and when financial conditions permitted. There is, in fact, little prospect that such pensions schemes would be set up on an extensive scale, and unless and until they are set up, no reliance can be placed on such a suggestion as a serious contribution to the problem. It is, indeed, to be feared that the present movement for setting up pension funds in connexion with particular undertakings would be checked, rather than stimulated, by the proposed considerable extension of State pensions.It is also open to question whether the retirement of men of 65 would afford opportunities for the employment of younger men to such an extent as the Report suggests. It should be remembered in this connexion that throughout the country there must be a number of men reaching 65 who are kept on at light work at reduced wages, and it is probable that if these men retired many of the resulting vacancies would never be filled.2. Cost of Increased Pensions.- Assuming that the Report has in mind some such figure as 10s. a week, and also assuming for the moment that at the outset it would be claimed by 300,000 men only* who are at present in employment, the cost would be  8 millions a year; but the population over 65 is constantly increasing, and it must be expected that in twenty years&apos; time the cost of paying 10s. a week to the men who would otherwise be still in industrial employment would have risen to  12 millions. These, however, are not exhaustive figures of the new liability. A special pension once granted to a person to induce him to retire from industrial work would presumably have to be continued for life; it would be impossible to withdraw it at any time on the ground that by reason of advanced age or infirmity he had become incapable of work, and must thenceforward be content with the normal old age pension provided under the Acts of 1908-24 or under the Act of 1925. Taking this into consideration, it is estimated that the ultimate effect of continuing for life the special pensions granted to men at 65, on the condition of retirement from employment, must be to create a charge exceeding  25 millions a year, in addition to the present cost of contributory and non-contributory old age pensions.It would also appear necessary to provide an additional payment of 10s. a week for pensioners&apos; wives who, not having reached the age of 65, had not yet become eligible for the contributory old age pension. As the increased pension would be conditional upon cessation of work, it must provide the man and his wife with reasonable compensation for the loss of the wages hitherto earned, and save in the case of the lower paid workers (assuming such discrimination to be* In the estimates of cost given in this paragraph, it lias been assumed that retirement pensions would only be paid in respect of men. The number of women still employed at the age of 65, except in domestic service, is doubtless a relatively small proportion of the total working population over that age.
possible) it must presumably be not less than 30s. a week for a married couple whether or not the wife is over 65. The extra cost of this provision for wives is estimated to be  3 millions a year at the outset, increasing with the growth of population to an ultimate amount of probably  6 millions.The suggestion that the money required could be found from savings to be effected by consolidation of the present insurance schemes is dealt with later in this memorandum, where the conclusion is reached that the postulated saving is visionary. Since the Report proposes that the additional pensions should be provided without increase of the present insurance contributions, there is no alternative to the conclusion that the Exchequer would have to bear the whole cost of these pensions.A still further, and serious, addition to the cost of the scheme seems to be inevitable. Persons who had already retired from employment before the scheme came into effect would assuredly complain of the unfairness of any proposal to limit the supplementary pension to those who were working when the scheme was introduced, and it would be impossible to refuse the additional payment to the former class. The cost of extending the pension to those insured persons who had already retired (and to their wives if still under 65) is estimated at about  10 millions a year.Summarising the foregoing figures as to cost of supplementary pensions, the position is as follows : (A.) At the outset Pensions of 10s. a week to 300,000 men aged 65 or overnow at work ... Additional pension of 10s. to married men whose wivesare under age 65 Pensions to men already retired, and to their wives   ...Total(B.) In 1950-Pensions to men aged 65 or over who have given up work since attaining that age  ... ...      overAdditional pensions to their wives if under age 65 ...Total    ... ... ... ...       over . Effect of Pensions at Flat Rates. It has been assumed, in the absence of any statement on the point in the Report, that the additional pension would be 10s. a week. It cannot be expected that men employed in the higher-paid occupations would be content to retire on a total pension of 30s. a week for a married man and 20s. a week for an unmarried man, and it would be found difficult to defend these amounts on the ground that employers were at liberty to add to them under voluntary schemes On the other hand, there are many thousands of workers over the age of 65 to whom 30s. a week would represent an approximation to earnings in the days of their maximum physical powers and of their heaviest family responsibilities. This would be particularly the case in regard to all agricultural labourers and many other rural workers. At one end of the scale such a pension would thus be denounced as inadequate, while at the other end it would be palpably excessive. It would probably not be feasible to vary a pension granted under a State scheme with reference to the earnings of the recipient actual or supposed-which he was required to relinquish as a condition of drawing the pension, but it is inevitable, in the circumstances indicated, that the grant of a flat rate pension would produce widespread dissatisfaction both among the recipient and the taxpaying classes. Nothing has prejudiced the present old age pension system so much as the means test. Something analogous to it could neither be introduced nor avoided without giving rise to acute controversy.4. Reactions on the Scale of Existing Health and Unemployment Insurance Benefi.ts.--It is necessary to consider the effect which a pension scheme with rates of 20s. a week for a single man and 30s. a week for man and wife would have on the health and unemployment insurance schemes. At present an insured contributor under the former scheme receives 15s. a week during first twenty-six weeks of sickness and 7s. Qd. thereafter in cash benefits and nothing for his wife, while under the unemployment insurance scheme a man receives 17s. cash benefit for himself with 7s. additional for his wife, if he has one.    All these rates would compare very 8,000,0003,000,000 10,000,00021,000,00025,000,000 6,000,00031,000,000
unfavourably with the augmented pensions proposed by the Report. The latter are to be paid as an inducement to leave work, whereas, it would be pleaded, the lower rates under the existing insurance schemes are payable to people who have lost work in consequence of physical or industrial misfortune, and are entitled, consequently, to special consideration. There would inevitably be a demand for levelling up the rates of benefit under, the present insurance scheme and, in particular, for the increase of the disablement benefit under National Health Insurance, which, at the normal rate, is 7s. 6d. a week. It would be claimed, in effect, that disablement benefit should be an invalidity pension and that it should be paid at the same rate as other pensions under the State scheme.The resulting increase of cost, which cannot be estimated with any degree of accuracy, could not be met within the present financial arrangements of the Insurance schemes and, unless the contributions of employers and workers under those schemes could be increased, it would have to be provided by the Exchequer. Moreover, the mere fact of the extension of the benefit would undoubtedly have a powerful and lasting effect on the rate of claim, which would produce an additional cost much in excess of that represented by the proportionate increase of the new benefit over the present rates.5. Administrative Difficulties. It appears to be inherent in the proposals of the Report that those who received the increased pension on giving up insurable employment should not be allowed to undertake any other remunerative occupation, whether for an employer or on their own account. It is difficult to see how such a condition could be enforced without supervision involving an altogether prohibitive amount of expense, even if inquisition of this kind would be tolerated by public opinion. In this connexion it may be recalled that in the course of a debate in Parliament on the 22nd February, 1928, on the operation of the Contributory Pensions Act, the Minister of Health pointed out that to make a pension conditional upon a man abstaining from work would be to impose a new means test of a more drastic kind than any of those which have been abolished. It would, in fact, restore the inquisitorial system which it is one of the chief merits of tbe Contributory Pensions Act to have removed. It is, however, clear that without unremitting super-vision abuse of the scheme, often amounting to actual fraud, would be widespread.6. The Burden of the Aged on the Working population. The future effect of the proposal to relieve the strain of unemployment by offering to the workers over 65 such considerable pensions as to induce them to retire is only partially indicated by the figures which have been given as to the rising cost of the special pensions. It must be looked at also from the point of view of the numbers of the population within the working ages on which would fall the burden of maintaining the aged.The following statement shows approximately the male population of Great Britain between the ages of 16 and 65, in contrast with the population, male and female, over the age of 65, and the estimated populations in corresponding categories in 1960 and 1980 respectively : Male Population Total Population agedYear. 16-65. (i5 and over.1929       ... ...        13,900,000 3,140,0001960       ... ...        15,640,000 5,220,0001980       ... ...        15,240,000 5,835,000These figures show that whereas there are at the present time 4-43 men at the working ages to every person over 65, the proportion will fall in 1960 to 3-00 and in 1980 to 2-61.That those over 65 should be placed in a situation to pass the remainder of their days in comfortable retirement is a humanitarian conception, which as a general proposition will command the assent of everybody. It is open to question, however, whether those who are to succeed the present generation in a community constituted as to age in a manner to which the history of the world affords no parallel, and to the economic conditions of which it gives no guidance, ought to be burdened by pledges given by the State, to relieve conditions which are believed to be temporary, that the aged will be freed from all responsibility for their own maintenance. If effect were given to the proposals of the Report and the present insurance services combined in such a way as to imply that the new retirement pensions were provided&apos; in part from the contributions of the insured, the pledge
of the State would indeed assume the form of a contractual obligation. To continue-such an obligation might be economically impossible, while repudiation would have disastrous consequences. The mortgaging of the resources of posterity implicit in the present Contributory Pensions scheme has been justified on the ground that as the burden of the scheme increases the cost of War Pensions will fall to a corresponding extent. This is clearly shown in Table VIII (page 26) of the Report of the Government Actuary on the Bill of 1925 (Cmd. 2406) To impose upon posterity a ^rowing burden of pensions under a contractual scheme, for which no counterbalancing relief is in prospect, might, in the circumstances indicated by the figures quoted, ultimately reflect upon those responsible for the scheme.Il.-Extension of Scope of National Insurance Scheme.7. Extension to other Industries. The Report affords no indication of the object of the proposal to extend the health and unemployment insurance schemes to other industries and occupations at present not included. Old age pensions, with which the Report is dealing when it makes this suggestion, are already provided for all persons insured under the National Health Insurance Scheme, which comprises within its scope employees in all industries, including not only ordinary wage earners and persons in private domestic service, but also out-workers, and, since January 1929, such classes as working sub-contractors and share fishermen. So far as widows&apos; and orphans&apos; pensions are concerned, there is also a small insured class of some 250,000 persons represented by Civil Servants and persons in certain other &quot;excepted &quot; employments. This class is not insured for old age pensions, but the members of it already retire on pensions at ages between 60 and 65, and accordingly the Report can hardly have them in mind.If the intention is to secure the inclusion of agricultural workers in the unemployment insurance scheme, it should be pointed out that a Committee under Sir Henry Rew&apos;s chairmanship was appointed in 1925 to consider the desirability of a scheme of insurance against unemployment for agricultural workers. The Committee produced two reports, the majority report being signed by six members and the minority report by five. In each case the report was against the application of unemployment insurance to agricultural workers in Scotland. The Majority Report said that there was no evidence, from that country, that a scheme of compulsory insurance was desired by, or would be acceptable to, either employers or workers. With regard to England and Wales, the Majority Report said that the employers were generally hostile, but that the workers were in favour of some form of unemployment insurance, although the views submitted to them from this quarter were not very clear, or definite, as to the form which a scheme of insurance should take. They accepted the view that the risk of unemployment was small, and therefore considered that the terms and conditions of the present Unemployment Insurance Acts were inapplicable to agriculture. They made tentative suggestions for a special scheme with low contributions. The minority of the Committee held that the evidence pointed to the absence of unemployment as an appreciable risk. While they also recommended that the industry should continue to be excepted from the general provisions of the Unemployment Insurance Acts, they said that in their view the Committee had no data upon which to formulate a separate scheme. It is evident that, however wide the differences between the two sections of the Committee, they were in agreement in the view that the risk of unemployment is small in the case of agriculture, and that this industry must not be brought into the general scheme and so be called upon to contribute in relief of the unemployment burden of other industries.As regards railways workers and certain other small classes of municipal and similar workers, the position is that they are in general excepted from unemployment insurance after they have completed three years&apos; service in permanent employment. Until that condition has been satisfied, workers in these services are included in the scheme. There would certainly be strong opposition from both employers and workers if it were proposed to bring into insurance&apos; those permanent workers who are now excepted on the ground that insurance against unemployment is not necessary in their case.8. Increase of Income Limit. The Report is probably aiming at an increase in the remuneration limit for non-manual employees from  250 to (say)  350 a year.
(There is no remuneration limit in the case of manual workers.) So far as unemploy-ment is concerned, non-manual workers with emoluments in excess of  250 a year are subject to little risk, and the purpose of suggesting their inclusion is presumably to alleviate the burden of unemployment benefit by getting in a new contributory class from which few claims for benefit would be received. Such a proposal would certainly be very strongly opposed by those affected..The inclusion of this class in the health and pensions scheme (and particularly the latter) would no doubt be in the interest of those concerned, but the fact that relatively few persons exercise their right to become voluntary contributors on passing the  250 limit suggests that there is little desire for State Insurance among the class. The proposal for an increase in the remuneration limit was considered and rejected by the Royal Commission on National Health Insurance which reported in 1926 (Cmd. 2596) on the ground that it would be strongly opposed by employers and the medical profession, and would probably not be welcomed by the employees concerned.III. Consolidation of the several Insurance Funds and other financial Resources.9. General. It is not clear why the report thinks that there is a strong case for enquiring into the desirability of combining and co-ordinating the several Insurance Funds, as well as the other monies mentioned in the Report. Although the Report refers in terms only to the combination of funds, it is apparent that in practice the administration of those funds would also have to be combined. Some light is thrown on this point by certain remarks of Lord Melchett. which are quoted in Part V of this memorandum.10. Position as between Health and Pensions Insurance. There is already complete co-ordination between the Health Insurance and Contributory Pensions schemes, the administration of which is closely interlocked, and, so far as concerns this aspect of the matter, nothing would be gained by an amalgamation of funds.The position in regard to finance is almost equally clear. The receipts for contributory pensions up to the end of March 1928 exceeded disbursements by about  37 millions. But it is estimated that in the 20 years following the 31st March, 1928, the payments in pensions to widows and to persons aged between 65 and 70, including the cost of administration, will amount to  814 millions. Against this amount the contributions of employers and workpeople, added to the fund of  37 millions in hand at the 31st March, 1928 (and its interest earnings), will only reach  612 millions, leaving a balance of  202 millions to be found from taxation., against which the only set off is the saving on State grants, amounting to less than  50 millions in all, arising from the fact that pensions have superseded Health and Unemployment benefits at the ages between 65 and 70. And this is not all; the Contributory Pensions Act confers greatly enlarged rights upon the aged population to pensions at the age of 70, and the resulting additional cost is borne wholly by the Exchequer. The estimated amount of this extra burden on the taxpayer over the next 20 years is  99 millions. Bringing everything together, it is calculated that over the twenty years ending in 1948 the taxpayer will have to provide over  250 millions, or an average of  12^ millions a year to support the benefits of the Contributory Pensions Act. The grant of supplementary pensions would inevitably increase the heavy burden with which the Exchequer is thus already confronted. It is possibly contemplated that the extra charge would be counter-balanced by reduction in the cost of unemployment insurance benefit, due to the removal of aged workers to the pension list and to the filling of their places from the unemployed, by savings on administration, and by drafts upon the accumulated Health Insurance Funds. The possibility (and their effects) in respect of each of these expedients are dealt with in later paragraphs.11. Position as between Health and Unemployment Insurance. Co-ordina-tion between the health and unemployment insurance schemes is already in operation so far as differences in the scope of the Schemes will allow. These differences are important. Such large classes as workers in agriculture, private domestic servants, nurses, outworkers, and railwaymen, as well as the miscellaneous groups of quasi-employees, who, although not employed under a contract of service, were brought into National Health Insurance in January 1929, are excluded from Unemployment f19066] l
Insurance, although comprised in the Health Insurance Scheme. These classes amount in the aggregate to some three million persons.The consolidation of the funds of the health and unemployment insurance schemes could only take place on the basis of a centralised administration for both. In particular, the amalgamation of the funds would involve the abolition of the Approved Societies and the transfer&apos; of their functions to local committees acting under the supervision of a central authority. But, in any case, the proposal to amalgamate these schemes appears to overlook certain important practical con-siclerations. The objects of the Schemes are so fundamentally different that their combined administration is impracticable. The Health Insurance Scheme provides for the prevention and cure of sickness, as well as for monetary relief during incapacity for work, and must be administered by a Department which is concerned with the general health of the community and works in close association with the medical profession. The Unemployment Insurance Scheme, on the other hand, provides for the relief of workers temporarily unemployed and must be administered by a Department whose primary concern is to find them work.12. Effects on Health Insurance Funds. So far as National Health Insurance is concerned, the inference behind the suggestion of the Report is apparently that there is a large surplus of funds which would be available for extinguishing the debt on the Unemployment Fund, and for assisting to meet the cost of the proposed new pensions.Any suggestion of this kind is quite unwarranted by the facts. It is true that a sum of approximately  125 millions in reserves has been accumulated. This money is not, however, in one common fund; it is the aggregate of the funds of some 7,000 Societies and Branches, partly invested, by themselves in securities held by their own trustees, and partly invested by the Central Departments on their behalf. It is in no sense free money. On the contrary, it is required to support the liability of the Societies in maintaining the normal and additional benefits now provided for their members. It is true that surpluses amounting to some  42 millions were declared at the last valuation, but these, with any surpluses that may be subsequently earned, will be required to maintain the provision of well-established additional benefits, such as Dental and Ophthalmic Benefit and Treatment in Hospitals and Convalescent Homes, as well as the additions to cash benefits to which the insured population has now become accustomed.Any attempt to have recourse to the funds of Approved Societies for the purposes of the suggested composite scheme would thus involve confiscation on a wholesale scale, resulting in the entire abrogation of additional benefits and the imperilling of the normal benefits. Any movement of the kind would be resisted strenuously by Societies of all types, while even if it could be carried in principle, the practical operation of compelling about a thousand bodies of trustees to transfer their invest-ments to the State would arouse intense opposition.13. Effect on Unemployment Insurance. The proposal to combine the system of Unemployment Insurance in a common fund with the Pension and other social insurance schemes would seem to be stimulated by the expectation that out of the present unemployment contributions a substantial sum would yearly be available towards the cost of the proposed new pensions. It cannot, however, be expected that any such result would follow. It is true that if some 300,000 men over 65 at present working were removed from industry, places would be found for a substantial (though smaller) number of younger men, and that more or less directly this might result in a corresponding reduction in the numbers on the Unemployment Register. But it has to be recognised that, at the present time, the numbers drawing unemploy-ment benefit are greatly in excess of those whom the contribution income of the fund would support, and that, in consequence, a heavy debt has accumulated on the Unemployment Fund, and is growing weekly. The first effect of a reduction in the number unemployed would be no more than gradually to produce a condition of equilibrium in the income and outgo of the Fund, and even this result would not be attained until the numbers unemployed had fallen to about one million. When this stage was reached the Fund would still be confronted by a debt amounting to some-thing approaching  40 millions, and before any money could be released from unemployment contributions for extraneous purposes this debt would have to be cleared off. The time over which the liquidation of the debt would extend is insusceptible of calculation everything depends upon the extent to which the numbers in receipt of benefit might fall.   It must, however, be realised that there is
an existing statutory provision, that when the debt has been cleared off and the Fund, placed in a sound condition, the contributions of the employers and the insured are to be reduced to rates commensurate with the financing of the Fund on what may be regarded as the normal level of unemployment. So far, therefore, as the TJnemploy-ment Fund is concerned, there appears to be no justification for any suggestion that by a combination of the Fund with other schemes of insurance money would be released from, the present unemployment insurance contributions to finance any new developments.   .It is recognised that it may be part of the scheme to extinguish the debt of the Unemployment Fund by recourse to the Health Insurance funds. The serious consequence attending amy such expedient have already been indicated.14. Poor Relief. The reference to money at present expended under the Poor Law is not understood. The authorities administering poor relief already take cognisance of payments under the insurance schemes. If the suggestion is that poor relief should be administered in conjunction with insurance benefits out of a common fund, the proposal seems indefensible. Contributions levied under an insurance scheme must be applied only to the purposes for which they were raised. The funds derived from such a source cannot properly be mixed with sums obtained from the rates and indiscriminately distributed in contractual benefits and the general relief of destitution. Apart from other objections, such a plan would meet with bitter opposition from the working classes, who would resent the association of any element of charity or &quot;pauperism&quot; with a scheme of insurance under which benefits are claimable as of right in return for contributions.15. Payments for Non-Contributory Old Age Pensions. As regards money expended in non-contributory pensions under the Old Age Pensions Acts to persons over t 0, it is difficult to see what any combination of accounts is likely to achieve. The liability under this head falls entirely on the Exchequer and there is no fund corresponding to those established under the Insurance Schemes.IV.-Payments to Emigrants from Insurance Funds.16. &apos; The possibility of paying an emigrant the capitalised value of his rights under the insurance schemes, to which allusion is made at the top of page 12 of the Report, was fully considered by Sir Donald Maclean&apos;s Committee on the Effect on Migration of Schemes of Social Insurance, which reported in 1926 (Cmd. 2608). The Committee explained that such a payment could only be made where contributions had exceeded current risks and where consequently funds had been accumulated. They pointed out that this condition arose only in respect of National Health Insurance, there being no provision for funding contributions in the other schemes, apart from a merely temporary arrangement in the case of the Pensions scheme connected with the equalising of the State grant for the first ten years. Even in the case of National Health Insurance they reported against the payment of surrender values to emigrants, on the ground that such payment would deplete the funds of resources which are required to finance the benefits of entrants into insurance at later ages than 16, including, as they specially mentioned, all classes of immigrants. It may be added that if any such payments were authorised an emigrants share of the reserves under this system would probably not be more than  2 or  3 on the average, regard being had to the relatively low age of emigrants. So small a sum could hardly be of much assistance to an emigrant.V. General Observations on the Consolidation of the Insurance, &amp;c, Services.17. With regard to the object of the proposed consolidation of the various Insurance Services it has been explained in various of the foregoing paragraphs that it is illusory to expect to finance the proposed new pensions, either wholly or in part, out of the financial resources of the other insurance schemes. There remains the question whether consolidation would reduce the expenses of administra-tion so far as to release any considerable sum. On this point the following statement, which is reported to have been made by, Lord Melchett recently, is
informing. The quotation is from the &quot;National Insurance Gazette,&quot; which in turn quotes from the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; of the 15th March, 1929 : &quot;We (the Conservatives)* propose to suggest that if you will only put together your National Health Insurance, Unemployment Insurance and Old Age Pension contributions and merge them into a scheme you will be able by centralisation and cheaper administration to alter your benefit so that you can without any extra contribution produce an increased old age pension. You would only give this to people on condition that they retire from industry.&quot;It has already been shown that the cost of an extra pension of 10s. a week to a man of 65 at present working, with a further 10s. a week for his wife so long as she is under 65, would be  11 millions a year at the outset, and ultimately over  30 millions&apos; a year, if it succeeded in withdrawing 300,000 such men from industry.The cost of administering the present social insurance services is as follows :   a year.Unemployment Insurance        ... ... ...      5,040,000National&apos; Health Insurance      ... ... ...      5,200,000Old Age Pensions Contributory       ... ... ... ... 950,000Non-contributory ... ... ... ... 890,000The total comes to  12,080,000 a year, and this will be diminished when the volume of unemployment is materially abated. This figure covers, in addition to the cost of general administration and collection of contributions, the expenses incidental to the authorisation and payment of monetary benefits aggregating  115 millions per annum, represented by nearly 200,000,000 separate weekly disbursements.Even at the present time, the cost of &quot; retirement pensions &quot; at the smallest rate that can be contemplated would hardly be met by savings on the existing schemes unless these could be administered for nothing.Of the items given above, all save National Health Insurance represent expenditure, whether central or local, controlled by a Central Department. The utmost economy is exercised in the whole of this field of State activity. No addition to the duties of staffs which are already fully occupied is practicable, and any attempt to reduce personnel by augmenting the work of the employees retained would result in a loss of efficiency reflected in an increased expenditure in benefits that would probably far exceed the amount saved on the salaries of the staffs retrenched. It cannot too strongly be emphasised that the principal work of the staffs concerned is the payment, and the supervision of the payment, of benefits which come partly from public funds and partly from compulsorily levied contributions. Parliament, giving expression to public opinion, is rightly insistent on the utmost vigilance in the expenditure of the vast sums of money involved in these schemes and could not be expected to tolerate a slackening of the present care in order to save a relatively small sum in administration expenses.National Health Insurance stands alone in the employment of outside agencies  the approved societies, which collect the contribution cards of the insured and administer sickness and disablement benefits, and the insurance committees, which, through their staffs, administer medical benefit.Many of the workers of the approved societies are employed on a part-time basis, and carry out their duties at rates of remuneration which, so far as the individual is concerned, are almost always on a modest scale. In other cases, and notably in the great centralised societies, the staffs are employed on a &quot; whole time &quot; basis and at rates of pay that are practically never above the market rates for this class of labour.It is problematical whether in the long run any saving could be effected in the cost of administering National Health Insurance by disestablishing the approved societies and putting the administration on a municipal basis with central control. Fewer persons, devoting their whole time to the work, might certainly be employed, but if these were to enjoy (as they would certainly claim) the status, rates of pay and superannuation rights of civil servants or established employees of local authorities, the total cost might well exceed the sum paid to the approved societies. At best, the change would be a leap in the dark attended, moreover, by the risk that any savings on administration would be outweighed by the increased cost of benefits resulting* The words in parenthesis are stated not to have appeared in the &quot; Manchester G-uardian,&quot; the report in which is otherwise said to be identical with that in the &quot; Daily Mail.&quot;
from the loss of the approved societies&apos; interest in an economical expenditure and from the loss of the personal touch between the officials of the societies and their members which, undoubtedly, many of these officials possess.Another jioint in this connection is at least worth mention. National Health Insurance provides many thousands of our citizens, especially through the Friendly. Societies and Trade Unions, with the opportunity of participating in public business, and of rendering service to the community of a character which cannot fail to stimulate the sense of responsibility in the individual, and to enlarge his outlook in regard to public affairs and problems of administration. It could not be wholly to the advantage of the State even if it could be shown that a little monetary saving might accompany it if the educative influence of the administration of National Health Insurance were withdrawn from those who now participate in the work and from those who will succeed them in the future.1. It is difficult to comment adequately on certain of the proposals as the Reporters themselves do not seem to have clearly visualised the results of their recommendations. It is probable that the Report is drafted loosely and vaguely in order to meet conflicting opinions which proved impossible of reconciliation.Recommendations 1 and 8 may be discussed together, as apparently it is proposed to find the money necessary for an increase of pensions by the amalgamation of the various Funds out of which Health and Unemployment Insurance and Pensions Benefits are at present paid. The proposal to hold a comprehensive enquiry into the possibility of co-ordinating Unemployment, Health and Pensions Insurance is not a new one, and it is an enquiry which will probably be entered upon at some future date. It involves, however, consideration of the abolition of Approved Societies, which is a very controversial proposition. The issue of the Melchett-Tillett Report has already stimulated activity in the Approved Society world, and it may be taken for granted that great opposition would be encountered to any proposal involving the abolition of these bodies. The Collecting Societies alone, with their huge number of Agents, would be formidable opponents of any such scheme. The Royal Commission on National Health Insurance, reporting in 1926, dealt with &apos;&quot; the Approved Society System &apos;&apos; in Chapters VIII and IX, and while specifically stating that they had not been asked to consider the unification of social Insurance, the Majority submitted a recommendation that Approved Societies should be retained as an essential part of the Health Insurance System, though they added the following : Paragraph 223. It must be clearly understood that our recommendation is made in relation to the Scheme of National Health Insurance as it exists at present, and that our view in favour of the retention of Approved Societies does not necessarily imply that developments in the system of Social Insurance outside the range of present contemplation might not necessitate a reconsider a-tion of the position.The Minority Report, on the other hand, concludes (6.) That the Approved Society system is a hindrance to the development of a(7.) That it is undesirable to retain Approved Societies any longer as the agenciesfor the distribution of cash benefits to insured persons. (8.) That Local Authorities could and should take the place of Approved Societies as the bodies through whom sickness and disablement benefits should be administered.The case for and against the Approved Society system is argued in Chapters VIII and IX of the Report.2. It will be recollected that a certain amount of pooling of the surplus funds of Approved Societies was recommended by the Royal Commission, but it was deemed inexpedient to give effect to this recommendation in the 1928 National Health Insurance Act. The reference in the Melchett-Tillett Report to a composite and co-ordinated Fund is not clear. The pensions under the 1908-24 Old Age Pension Acts are paid from monies voted annually, and the three Insurance Funds. i.e., Health, Pensions, and Unemployment, are constituted and managed in entirely different ways. The proposal to include in the general pool &apos;&apos; money at present expended under the Poor Law &quot; is not intelligible, as the Report seems to indicate that the existing contributory schemes of Insurance will continue.   They may, how-(ii.) Memorandum by Department of Health for Scotland.
%ever, contemplate Insurance benefits and non-contributory old age pensions being paid through Public Assistance Committees, such as were proposed in the &quot;Maclean Report,&quot; such benefits being supplemented by Local Authorities.3. The Contributory Pensions Scheme has proved very attractive and the Inspectors report a general increase of interest in the Health Insurance Scheme.It is difficult to believe that the present insured population would welcome the linking up of their Health and Pensions scheme with any Poor Law provisions.As the Government Actuary is reporting on the financial aspects of the proposals, it need only be noted here that the Unemployment Pund is presently heavily in deficit and, so far as the National Health Insurance Fund is concerned, the Act provides for the expenditure of all ascertained surpluses. If the Fund is to be merged with other funds it will be necessary to fix definitely what Health Insurance&apos; benefits (including fixed rates of cash benefits) are to be provided from the common pool.4. Summary. It would be a valuable social and economic service to reduce the number of young unemployed and at the same time secure a more general retiral of the old at 65 years, but, apart from their financial aspects, the proposals made to achieve this end involve such drastic amendment of existing Statutes and schemes and of the organisations operating them that they are certain to provoke strong opposition from many quarters. ,5. Extension of Health and Unemployment Schemes. The possible extension of Health Insurance is limited. The only substantial addition would come through raising the income limit. This matter was considered by the Royal Commission on National Health Insurance who recommended no change, and it is to be remembered that in the case of manual workers no income limit is imposed under the Acts. Under Unemployment Insurance, the domestic, agricultural and railway classes might be included, but the Blanesburgh Committee did not report favourably on inclusion, and there appears to be no general demand from the workers themselves.If it were financially possible, there is, of course, a wide field for the extension of voluntary insurance in.respect of Health and Pensions in the case of persons who are their own employers, e.g., small shopkeepers, small farmers, &amp;c, and there has recently been a. clamour from this class for inclusion in the Health and Pensions scheme. In this connection it may be explained that at the commencement of the National Health Insurance Act an opportunity was afforded to this class to become Voluntary Contributors, provided that their incomes did not exceed the income limit laid down in the Act for employed persons. Very little advantage was taken, however, of this opportunity and the provision was repealed in 1918. With the introduction, however, of pensions insurance (Widows and Old Age) the class in question realise more acutely the value of insurance and they now raise a clamour for voluntary inclusion&apos;. The difficulties in the way are, of course, obvious as voluntary insurance would amount, in their case, to selective insurance, and would probably be taken advantage of at a time when the person could qualify for benefits by paying a minimum number of contributions. The Contributory Pensions Act did give an opportunity, during a limited period, to persons who had previously been in insurance for a period of 104 weeks to become Voluntary Contributors, but many would-be contributors of the small-employer class did not possess the necessary qualification.6. The Provision of a Surrender Value for Emigrants -The suggestion of a surrender value provision for emigrants depends largely upon actuarial considera-tions, but the policy of reserving this concession to emigrants alone and hot granting it to all persons passing out of the Insurance schemes would require serious reflection. It is clear that given a fixed fund the benefits can be varied substantially only at the expense:of one another. At present the emigrants&apos; money goes to the general good with a reversionary interest to the emigrant should he return and require a new reserve value. Our experience of the past few years indicates that the number of returned emigrants, especially older men, is considerable. It might be that the loss to the&apos; general fund would be so small that it would be practicable without altering the scheme as a whole to allow such a surrender value, perhaps subject to a capital payment by the returning emigrants who become again insurable. but&apos; how far the finance of the fund is sufficiently elastic to permit such a concession is a question for the Actuary. Since the idea is clearly to encourage emigration the present outflow abroad of insured persons is not the measure of the effect on the fund.
Chapter XY.- Recommendation 2: Emigration.(i.) Memorandum by Overseas Settlement Department.1. The section of the Melchett-Tillett report which deals with emigration appears insufficiently to appreciate the fact that schemes for encouraging migration to the British Dominions must have the approval of the Dominion Governments. Such approval involves detailed control by the Dominion Governments with an inevitable slowing down of the rate and volume of movement.A special loan for migration would involve a new policy outside the Empire Settlement Act. The report suggests that inadequacy of funds has checked the movement; this is not the case the Empire Settlement Act provides for expenditure up to  3,000,000 per annum, but in no year has this sum been needed to finance the available volume of movement on the 50/50 basis.2&quot;. The Report of the Duckham Mission rivets attention upon the root cause which prevents the movement of population from this country to Australia. A wholly artificial standard of wages without regard to efficiency, bolstered up by successive increases in a very indiscriminate tariff, have involved Australia in a vicious circle of ever-ascending costs and prices, which make cost of production so high that, excepting wool and wheat, her products cannot compete in the world&apos;s markets. Consequently her progress is crippled, her power of supporting increased population destroyed and unemployment is growing. The vicious circle, which owes its existence and growth to the policy of the Labour Union, is the main cause of unemployment and the consequent f alling-off of immigration from this country. The Mission believe that the situation must get worse before it can get better, and that there will be a further decline in migration during the next few years.3. If satisfactory arrangements can be made with the Dominion Governments and the Dominion Trade Union movements to co-ordinate conditions of emigration and the employment of emigrants, the problem will be greatly simplified. But in Australia and New Zealand and in large measure in Canada, organised Labour is consistently opposed to the introduction of possible competitors in industry and especially of those who do not pay their own way, and are helped by charity or by Government. Labour would no doubt contend that if ample opportunities were available, their opposition would be withdrawn. It would seem, however, that it is the attitude of Labour which is largely the cause of the lack of opportunities. Efforts by Labour in this country, as well as by other authorities, to secure the co-operation of Labour in the Dominions have not so far been successful.4. Sensational proposals designed to encourage large and rapid movements of population from the industrial areas of Great Britain, e.g., for the raising&quot; of a loan for emigration or the acquisition and settlement by His Majesty&apos;s Government in Great Britain of tracts of land in the Dominions, are likely to cause anxiety im the Dominions, and may react on the normal flow of migrants from this country.5. The nature of the machinery for co-ordinating policy is a matter of comparatively minor importance. If the Dominion Governments and Dominion Trade Unions would agree to a Joint Committee, well and good, but it is unlikely.6. As to the two recommendations on p. 11 of the Report: (1) Persons going out to land work cannot be segregated in separate communities on arrival overseas, but must be distributed in such a manner as to have the benefit of the advice and help of the established population. But no doubt the authors of the Report would agree as to this as would other advocates of colonisation schemes ; (2) All schemes for land settlement overseas provide for more or less liberal assistance  whether by loan or grant during the first two or three years of settlement. Such assistance must not be carried so far as to lead settlers to relax their own efforts and look to the Government for help.(ii.) Memorandum by Ministry of Labour.1. The Melchett-Tillett report attributes the low figures of emigration to inadequate finance and suggests a loan. It also proposes an Imperial Common-wealth Committee consisting of employers, representatives of the British and
Dominion Trade Unions, and of the Governments, and, to facilitate migration, the capitalisation of benefits payable under the various Insurance Schemes.2. The Industrial Transference Board examined the position of migration in some detail and the subject was dealt with fully in their Report last year. Under present conditions migration will only help unemployment indirectly. The migration of &quot;the unemployed&quot; means &quot;assisted migration,&quot; and &quot;assisted migration &quot; means controlled migration. If Government money even if it is all British Government money is involved, the Dominions will claim and exercise a right of control. The proposal for a Committee of Trade Union representatives , from the Dominions ignores the fact that the Dominion Trade Unions are bitterly opposed to migration on principle. The Dominion authorities profess to be compelled by this opposition to limit assisted migration, broadly, to agriculture. The unemployed do not want to work in agriculture and are not entirely suited to such work; in many cases it is a waste of their industrial tradition and skill.3. By strenuous efforts it may be possible, over each of the next five years, to send out some 10,000 unemployed as &quot; assisted migrants.&quot; That is probably the most that can be hoped for. Migration is not held up by lack of finance ; the Report is confused in contrasting loan and revenue expenditure. Suggestions for buying large blocks of territory in Canada or Australia (which would require a loan) and &quot; colonising&quot; them under a Government scheme, ignore all the realities of the position. Something on these lines might be done by a Chartered Company, if there is a Rhodes in the Company; but if there is a Rhodes, there is little need of the Company. In the Dominions migration is politics, perhaps the fundamental issue of politics, and &quot; political &quot; migration will never reach high figures. It is for this reason that the Ministry of Labour take the view that migration will only have indirect effects. If the Dominions really want settlers, of all trades and classes, they can get them by going out to get them, with publicity, appeals, inducements, &amp;c. Such migration would be &quot; mixed,&quot; of all classes and trades ; it is the best migration. If it reached proper dimensions, the departure of so many people would undoubtedly create some vacancies which would be filled by the unemployed; it would also increase the purchasing power of the Dominions, and, through the steady Influence of British migrants, direct the use of that purchasing power to this country.4. But if migration is to reach proper figures, it is essential that it should be left mainly to private enterprise and the operation of ordinary commercial factors. The continued, and often changeable, intervention of the Governments in the finance and policy of migration creates uncertainty and so destroys the possibilities of a long-term policy by Shipping Companies and other commercial interests, and immediate results, usually disappointing, are aimed at, to the sacrifice of much greater, though slower, results over a period of years.Chapter XVI. Recommendation 3: Mining Areas.(i.) Memorandum by Ministry of Labour.1. The report states (p. 12, section 4, A. 7) that, in view of the gravity of unemployment in the mining industry, the industry should be considered as a special case. The report recommends that &quot;the Government should recognise that certain mining areas are now unable to provide employment for a large proportion of their population, and they should continue at an accelerated rate relief measures and schemes for a well-organised system of transference to districts where there is a reasonable chance of fresh employment.&quot;2. Everything possible has been and is being done in the direction indicated by the Report. In the course of the year 1927 it became clear that special measures were required to deal with the unemployment position in the coal mining and other heavy industries, and it was gradually becoming recognised that there was attached to these industries a personnel surplus to their requirements, either immediate or prospective.The policy adopted to deal with the situation during 1928 was that of trans-ferring unemployed workers from areas where their chances of absorption into regular employment had disappeared, to employment in the more prosperous areas
both at home and overseas. The machinery for carrying out this policy was already in part to hand in the employment exchange machinery of the Ministry of Labour, supplemented by other facilities, including the Ministry&apos;s training centres for young men for home and overseas employment. Through the Exchange machinery and the training centres a steady movement from depressed areas and industries was already taking place.3. Early in 1928 the first step was taken in the development of a more conscious policy of transfer. A network of Juvenile Unemployment Centres was developed by the Ministry of Labour in association with Local Education Authorities in the depressed coal-mining areas of South &quot;Wales, the North-East Coast and Scotland, and a practical element was introduced into the curriculum of instruction at the centres (hitherto mainly designed to prevent demoralisation during periods of idleness). Such success attended this development that attendance at these centres became recognised as a necessary step towards transfer, and a steady stream of boys, mainly between 16 and 18, began to pass through them from the depressed areas to employment in other parts of the country. In the early summer a further experiment in the direct transference of young single men from the depressed areas was successfully launched.4. In June 1928 the Industrial Transference Board, which had been appointed in January to consider the possibilities of transference, issued its Report: Cmd. 3156. As a result of the Board&apos;s recommendations, which were adopted, the facilities for transference from the depressed areas were widely extended in the latter part of 1928 and in the first months of 1929. These facilities may be grouped broadly under two heads: (a.) Financial Aids to Movement from the Depressed Areas.These include advances to enable workers to travel to employment which is found for them, or which they have found for themselves; and advances and grants to help married men to pay for the removal of their families and furniture to new areas and to maintain two households while they are looking for accommodation, &amp;c.(b.) Training Facilities.These include Juvenile Unemployment Centres, training centres for men for employment, both in this country and overseas, training centres for girls and&apos; young women, &amp;c.5. By the full use of those facilities which are still being developed a great impetus has been given to the movement of unemployed workpeople away from the depressed areas to employment in other areas found for them mainly by the Employment Exchanges of the Ministry of Labour. The success of the Exchanges in finding openings is founded, in no small measure, upon the letter addressed by the Prime Minister in August 1928, to all employers, urging them whenever possible to offer some of their vacancies to men from the depressed areas. As a direct result of this appeal, which was followed up by visits of Exchange officials to a large number of employers, 2,000 openings for men from the depressed areas were found within two months. Since August 1928 about 16,000 persons have been transferred from these areas. It should be remembered that this movement has taken place at a time when the employment market as a whole has been depressed, and that the coming months offer much greater scope for the development of the policy.6. As a special part of the effort to stimulate transference the State has offered financial assistance on generous terms to local and other public authorities in prosperous areas, where employment is relatively good, to carry out works of public utility on condition that they will take 50 per cent, of the labour required from the depressed areas. Schemes have already been sanctioned under these terms in the early months of 1929, which will require the transfer of nearly 2,500 men from the depressed areas. It is anticipated that further schemes will be submitted for sanction in the near future.At the same time, grants are still available to local authorities and public utility companies in respect of works instituted in areas where unemployment is exceptional. The State liability (capitalised) in respect of the annual charges from 1928 onwards in respect of loans approved was  22,300,000.
(ii.) Memorandum by Department of Health, Scotland.Mining&apos;s plight has possibly received extra prominence because of the publicity that the miners&apos; leaders have been able to secure. Yet, according to p. 4 of the Report, other industries show a higher percentage of unemployment. If it is accepted that the mining industry will never again absorb all the workers hitherto associated with it, its position, of course, deserves special consideration. The Report suggests that accelerated relief measures and schemes of transference should be resorted to. In Scotland, and in England for that matter, the coal position appears to be improving. It is safe to say that distress in Scotland has never assumed the proportions that have obtained in South Wales and Northumberland. To-day the Miners Distress Fund is capable of meeting all cases of distress that emerge, and a substantial sum of money is in hand. The speeding up of transference from the mining areas, however, does seem desirable.Chapter XYII. Recommendation 4.Orders for Government and Municipal Departments.(i.) Memorandum by the Treasury.1. The Melchett-Tillett Report recommends that &quot; Orders for Government and Municipal department*allotments should be placed in this country under properly regulated conditions, including scientific costing and the arbitration of cases where it is proposed to place orders abroad.&quot;2. The question of Imperial Preference in Government contracts has been under fairly frequent consideration of recent years; the last occasion being the Cabinet decision of the 14th November, 1928.In accordance with the resOlutions* of the Imperial Economic Conference, 1923, to which His Majesty&apos;s Government have publicly expressed adherence, a considerable Imperial preference is in fact given (the maximum normal limit is 25 per cent, and even this may be exceeded in special cases, but as a rule much smaller percentages suffice), and as a result, partly of this; but mainly of natural causes, the percentage of orders placed in foreign countries is very small. The only controversy has been on a proposal made by the Secretary of State for Dominions and Colonies that the rates of preference should be fixed and made public.3. The objections to thisj largely based on the practical experience of members of the Contracts co-ordinating Committee (a Committee representing the heads of the main Government Department Contract Branches) are-(i) that a fixed percentage would rule out consideration, 6n merits, of cases where a higher percentage might rightly be given;(ii) that it would unduly restrict competition, raise prices, encourage ringsand subsidise inefficiency;(iii) that a fixed preference is the negation of ordinary financial control inthat it prevents proper consideration Of cost.4. The question came to the Cabinet last November in view of a particular case in which the only defence of the General Post Office against a ring was to place an order abroad. In this case the publication of a fixed preference of 25 per cent, (which appears to be the limit which was contemplated) would hot have secured the order for British firms who required a preference of 40 per cent.The Cabinet oh the 14th November, 1928, decided thiat the existing practice should continue, but that in future ho contract&apos; should be placed abroad without the sanction of the Departmental Minister.5. The objects of the Melchett-Tillett Report, so far as reasonable, are thus fully met, and the latest ruling secures that proper extra-Departmental considera-tion is given, where necessary* in a way not open to the obvious practical objections whioh apply to the proposed &quot; costing and arbitration &quot; procedure.* Copy attached.
6. The recommendation pf the Report ip fact classes British territory over-seas with foreign countries, but it is assumed that this is unintentional. In practice a larger preference is given by Government Departments to the home contractor.Imperial Economic Conference, 1923 :  Imperial Preference in PublicContracts.It was decided to adopt the following Resolution :-1. &quot; That this Imperial Economic Conference reaffirms the principle that in all Government contracts effective Preference be given to gpods made and materials produced within the Empire except where undertakings entered into prior to this Conference preclude such a course or special circumstances render it undesirable or unnecessary.&quot;2. &quot; That so far as practicable, efforts be made to ensure that the materials used in carrying out contracts be of Empire pi&apos;oduction.&quot;3. &quot; That State, provincial and local government authorities should be encouraged to take note of the foregoing resolutions.&quot;(ii.) Memorandum by Ministry of Health.The present arrangements in regard to restriction of local authorities&apos; supplies to home manufacturers are as follows : 1. Where unemployment grant is given, local authorities have to place all contracts for, or incidental to, the works in this country.2. Local authorities have also been urged to give a similar preference, in other contracts. They have been told that they should make sure that so far as is reasonably practicable British materials and components only are used in the goods purchased.3. A Circular has also been issued urging Imperial preference (but subject to the first preference for the home market).4. It is not considered that it would be right for the Government to go beyond this limit, and to make grants (other than unemployment grants) or sanction to loans subject to the condition that only British goods be used.5. Local authorities generally are fully inclined to give preference to British goods, but a number of local authorities have experience that to tie themselves down only to British articles would be to pay prices far in excess of what would otherwise be necessary. The Ministry of Health have investigated some com-plainfs against foreign contracts, and practically always the local authority had a good case.6. In their reference to costing and arbitration the Melchett-Tillett Conference presumably have in mind a system on the lines adopted in the War. In criticism it may be said : (1.) That this is an elaborate piece of machinery;(2.) That war conditions, with the absence of competition, present quite a special set of conditions, calling for special measures;(8.) That the proposed cure is drastic for&quot; a small ill, for the percentage of public aqthprity orders that now go abroad that could be placed at home is probably quite small;(4.) Costing is really npt an adequate substitute for competition. Costing xnugt be in terms of prevailing organisation and efficiency. One prirnary need (a real need iu British industry according to many criticsV may be a higher standard in both ;(5.) Lastly, it is a little futile in this respect that, unless English manu-facturers can compete in foreign markets, measures of wider scope than these pow imder consideration woidd seena tp be required,7. A polioy on the lines of the Melchett-Tillett recommendations would probably hieet with strong opposition from a large pumber of the local authorities.[19066] m 2
(iii.) Memorandum by Department of Health, Scotland.1. So far as housing schemes are concerned, the Government and Local Authorities do not themselves place orders for the materials required in building the houses. This is done by the contractors for the respective trades, who are left to find their materials in any market they choose provided the quality is up to standard.In June, 1923, and March, 1925, the Scottish Office issued circulars to all Local Authorities in Scotland recommending that preference be given to goods made and materials produced within the Empire. This recommendation, however, is scarcely applicable to assisted housing schemes, in view of the provision of Section 10 of the Housing (Financial Provisions) Act, 1924, that the Department are not to &quot; impose any condition which would prevent the materials required being purchased in the cheapest market at home or abroad......&quot;2. The principal imported materials now in use for housing are timber, doors, wall boarding, electric fittings, cement, nails, slates and tiles. Of these timber alone may be said to be the&apos; only article that is not produced of suitable quality and in sufficient quantities in this country. Some of the doors and wall boarding are produced within the Empire and imported here, but the rest of the materials come from the continent -principally Germany, Belgium and France.Because of the extent to which they are controlled by rings, the price of building materials is very susceptible to market restrictions, and any exclusion of foreign materials would almost certainly result sooner or later in higher prices.3. In June, 1921, the Committee appointed by the Secretary for Scotland to enquire into the high cost of building working-class houses in Scotland reported as follows : &quot; We cannot but attach importance to the extent to which &apos; rings&apos; and combinations have eliminated competition in the supply of the most important building materials, such as bricks, cement, light castings, pipes and fireclay goods. It is not within the terms of our remit to consider either the circumstances in which combinations had their origin or the services which they claim to render to the community; but we are concerned with the fact that after securing a firm footing they have eliminated competition and deprived authorities charged with the responsibility of spending public money of the protection which a system of genuine open competition used formerly to secure. We think that some action is immediately necessary to regain this - protection to the taxpayer, and that in any trade where monopoly has been established or where for national purposes a preferential or favoured or protected position has been given to those whose products are required for working-class dwellings, the taxpayer or his representatives should be armed with powers to secure such an investigation into costs of production as will protect the taxpayer against abusive or unfair manipulation of prices. Prom the evidence we have received in regard to building materials we endorse the opinion expressed by the Committee on Trusts in their Report, dated the 24th April, 1919 (Cmd. 9236), in the following terms : &apos; We believe that it will be found necessary ultimately to establish further machinery for promptly and effectively dealing with such abuses as the Tribunal of Investigation (on Trusts) may discover.&apos;&quot; We are not a little impressed with evidence of actual and prospective scarcity of several materials; and with a view. to obtaining ampler and cheaper supplies, we are in favour of foreign material being admitted into this country without being subjected to any unnecessary impediment; believing that in this way a more reasonable level of price might be reached for home-produced material.* * * . * * *&quot; The evidence establishes the fact that in certain areas certain trades have by combination eliminated entirely competition for public contracts. Where this practice exists, it must have a very effective bearing on the question of cost.&quot;
4. The actual experience of the Department has been that the importation of foreign building materials has tended to keep down the price of house building. In 1920 and 1921 home prices were unprecedentedly high and were prevented from going higher by extensive importation of such materials as bricks, baths and cement from the continent. Unless, therefore, some adequate safeguard can be devised, it would appear that in existing circumstances the exclusion of foreign building materials will raise the price of house building.5. On the subject of safeguards, the cost of glass may be cited. Practically all the glass used in housing schemes is supplied by a home firm (Pilkington). This firm have an arrangement with the Glazing Trade whereby the trade is supplied with glass at a specially low rate where the purchaser undertakes the glazing at a fixed rate. This fixed rate varies from time to time, but it ia a reasonable one and the arrangement has worked quite well,6. With a view to exercising some control over the price of building materials, a Committee was appointed in 1923 &quot;to survey the prices of building materials and to receive and consider complaints in respect thereof, and to report from time to time to the Minister of Health and the President of the Board of Trade as to the facts, and in particular as to the extent to which in any case the price appears to be unduly high by reason of the operation of any trade combination, trust or agreement.&quot; This Committee have reported periodically, but it is open to doubt whether their operations have contributed substantially to the control of building prices. In their report for the period to February, 1927, the Committee stated that they had reviewed the position and had formed the opinion that, having regard to the general high level at which the prices of certain articles continued to be maintained, further investigation was called for. A Sub-Committee was accordingly appointed, but no reference appears to be made to the subject in the later reports. It is thought that the Committee had insufficient powers to prosecute their enquiries profitably.Chapter XYIII. Recommendations (5) Trade Facilities and (6) crown colonies Development.(i.) Memorandum by the Treasury.1. The original Trade Facilities Scheme was framed in the post-war depression of 1921 when it was thought that many sound schemes of capital expenditure were being held up by high money rates and the expectation of a fall in production costs. The primary aim was to relieve unemployment by the expenditure of the guaranteed loans on plant and machinery in Great Britain. Guarantees were given in respect of loans raised by all kinds of bodies, including Foreign Governments, Public Utility and Industrial Undertakings at home and abroad. In the main the scheme was a transitory expedient based on the &quot; anticipation&quot; of orders which would otherwise have been deferred or placed elsewhere.2. Guarantees under the Acts 1921-6 total over  73 millions. About  10 millions went to finance foreign undertakings,  10J millions went to the Dominions and Colonies and the remaining  52J millions to domestic concerns, the whole amount of the guaranteed loans, together with, in many cases, additional sums raised without any Government guarantee, being expended on British goods. The main benefit of the scheme went to the heavy industries, Iron and Steel, Fngineering and Shipbuilding. Administration was entirely in the hands of an independent Committee of business men and the scheme was run on sound lines. The real point of the scheme was acceleration; cheap Government credit was held out as an inducement to undertake capital works earlier than they would otherwise have been undertaken. The sum total of employment was not really increased, but employment was given earlier in time than might otherwise have been possible. After the lapse of several years virtue went out of the scheme and the objections to it strengthened. It was felt that the use of capital in this way gave employment in one direction by withdrawing it in another and that it added to the difficulty of certain trades where there was already an excess of the means of production, e.g., in the Shipping trade. The announcement in the Budget Speech of 1926 that the scheme had outlived its
usefulness and would not be renewed after the 31st March, 1927, aroused no protest from any side and the end of the Acts passed almost unnoticed in the Press or elsewhere. The main interest now is the cost of the scheme to the Exchequer. The guarantees outstanding total some , 66 millions, which will mostly run off over the next 20 years. Payments by the Treasury in fulfilment of guarantees already approach     million, and will go a good deal higher.3. The recommendation in Item 5 of the Melchett-Tillett summary is that &quot; Trade Facilities should be reinstituted under more liberal conditions.&quot; It would appear, however, from the relative sections of the Report that this is misleading, and that it is intended that the application of Government credit should be restricted to two special cases: (i.) To finance amalgamations and rationalization in the depressed industries in Great Britain (pp. 14-15). (ii.) To encourage development in the Grown Colonies involving the placing of orders for plant in Great Britain (p. 33).Only the second of these proposals is really an extension of the Trade Facilities scheme. The first is fundamentally different, as the use of Government credit is given primarily for the assistance of the industry receiving the guarantee and not for the purpose of capital expenditure to afford immediate employment. In fact such credits to be useful must probably be largely for working capital, and the immediate effect, as the Report admits, would be to reduce the employment given by the combined industries.4. Both these proposals would re-act unfavourably on Government credit. The effect of Government guarantees is exactly the same as additional Government borrowing on the gilt edged market, tending to raise Government interest rates and ultimately general industrial rates. Nor can the effect on Government credit be measured by the actual amount of the guarantees. The original Trade Facilities scheme was regarded as an incubus on the market and its termination was a relief. The revival of guarantees, even if limited in period and amount, would carry with it fears of a continuance of the policy for an indefinite time for annual renewal as in the previous case, and would re-act on Government credit to a greater extent than the actual magnitude of the loans would justify. This would be unfortunate at the present time when heavy borrowing is necessary for other purposes (Local Loans, and Telephones) and would affect the prospects of dealing successfully with the Conversion of 5 Per Cent. &quot;War Loan. Accordingly the renewal of guarantees involves substantial disadvantages to the Exchequer by adding to the cost of Government borrowing and retarding the progress of Conversion as well as indirectly by the payments required to implement the liability a serious matter if the proportion of loans under the old scheme is to be increased by a less &quot; rigid and conservative &quot; administration.5. No doubt the Melchett-Tillett argument would be that these disadvantages niust be accepted in view of the overriding necessity to restore the depressed industries, particularly the Iron and Steel, Coal and Textile Trades, which are the foundation of our national prosperity. Such restoration, it is argued (pp. 14-15) depends on a process of rationalisation and amalgamation. Such reorganisation requires finance, and finance is not forthcoming without reorganisation. In breaking this vicious circle the Committee see a veiy proper use of Government credit.6. Exactly similar proposals were considered last summer by the Unemploy-ment Policy Committee of tfie Cabinet. That Committee laid down the outline of a scheme to ensure that Government assistance would only be given to economical amalgamations with reasonable management and capitalisation unable to obtain finance through the ordinary channels. The combining concerns were to lpave all their assets in the combined business, and creditors were not to acquire any advantage that would not accrue in a sound arrangement without Government participation. New capital was to be used exclusively as working capital and for development, and the guarantees were to be limited to, say,  10 millions,, to be given within a strictly defined period on the recommendation of a very strong Advisory Committee.1 7. . But (a) these conditions, though satisfactory on paper, would, in practice, involve difficulty.   It has been the experience in recent amalgamations that it is
only the necessity for raising new capital in the market which can ensure that amalgamations are framed in the most economical way with the necessary1 changes in personnel and with nothing more than their true value assigned to the rights of proprietors and creditors.(b.y There is in fact no evidence that properly framed amalgamations cannot obtain all the finance they require On the open market on reasonable terms. A scheme that would satisfy the Advisory Committee would satisfy the market. In many cases no additional finance is required at all, e.g., the Vickers-Armstrong fusion, and in mdst the need for working capital is at least as pressing as the need for development expenditure.After consideration the Unemployment Policy Committee did not endorse the scheme of assistance, but left the matter over for further consideration if the need arose.8. It is becoming increasingly difficult to argue that amalgamations cannot proceed without Government assistance. The progress made in the Iron and Steel Trade is evidenced by the arrangements between Vickers-Armstrong and Cammell Laird and Cargo Fleet and South Durham; the negotiations between Bolckow Vaughan and Dorman Long and between the Wigan Coal and Iron Company and other interests. In the Coal Trade there is the Powell-Duffryn arrangement and the Melchett Anthracite Group; and in the Cotton Trade, which the Unemployment Policy Committee had particularly in mind, the arrangements recently made with the assistance of the Bank of England for the Lancashire Cotton Company.9. To impose a scheme of Government assistance at this stage wolild accordingly seem likely to check the spirit of individual initiative, which has1 reasserted itself, to encourage the Banks to maintain a non-possumus attitude, ahd the trades concerned to drift on in the hope of avbiding the necessary sacrifices involved in reconstruction at the expense of the&apos; State. This conclusion is endorsed by the final Report of the Balfour Committee on Industry and Trade (Gmd. 3282 of 19^9), which declares that  (p. 299) &quot;the first steps must come from the industries themselves in the way of financial reconstruction, writing down of Capital and reorganization and management; when these steps are taken the stream of hew capital will begin to flbW. In short, the basic industries can work out their owh regeneration, provided &quot; they are thoroughly convinced that sdeh measures are essential and unavoidable, and that they must be taken by themselves without reliance on any outside authority.&quot;10. It remains to deal with the second part of the Committee&apos;s recommenda-tions in this matter, viz.; the use of Trade Facilities for Colonial schemes involving expenditure in Great Britain: It is not entirely clear what the Committee have in mind here; Guarantees for Colonial schemes could be and were given under the original Trade Facilities scheme. There was also a scheme under Section 2 (1) of the Trade Facilities Act 1924 which enabled the Treasury to make cash Grants under certain conditions towards the interest charges on the portion to be spent in Great Britain on loans raised by the Dominions and Colonies for public utility undertakings. The experience of this scheme was discouraging. Apart from one special scheme to the Sudan, only five schemes were approved in the three years for which the scheme was opened, involving in all an expenditure in the United Kingdom of some half a million pounds. It is very doubtful, therefore, whether there is any genuine demand for facilities of this kind.11. The committee&apos;s proposals possibly have reference to the more coittpre-hehsive attd nbvei scheme ds contained in the Hiltori-Youhg Report on the East and Central African Dependencies, pp. 171 et seq. of Cmd. 3234/28, which recommends the provision of new capital facilities constantly &quot; On tap,&quot; either&apos; (a) by the formation of a Colonial Development PUnd (apparently to be fed by grants from Imperial revenues); or (b) by the creation of &quot;Colonial Loans&quot; machinery analogous to that nbw in force for Local Loans ; or (c) by the provision froin time to time of ad hoc facilities for borrowing under British Government guarantee (as under the East Africa Guaranteed Loans Act), but with a less rigid insistence on the borrowers ability tb meet his obligations&apos; from the&quot; first, Without recourse to the Guarantor.12. Schemes for extension of Colonial development are intrinsically attractive and there are advantages in diverting investment to any extent ttiat may be
practicable from foreign to Empire countries. But in considering proposals of this kind there are certain caveats to be entered : (i.) Attempts to accelerate Colonial development by easy borrowing terms areapt to lead to wasteful and ill-advised expenditure, (ii.) Schemes that are well thought out and skilfully executed occupy a lougtime before they result in any stimulation of British exports.. Morethan half the capital is as a rule spent locally and orders immediatelyplaced in this country for materials are often disappointingly small, (iii.) The capital used for these purposes is diverted from other uses whichmight in many instances have been more immediately productive here, (iv.) The Trustee Securities Acts, giving many Colonial issues trustee status,already give to many parts of the Empire great opportunities of raising the capital they desire.13. The simplest and most economical method of dealing with Colonial requirements which cannot be met by independent Colonial borrowings would be to extend from time to time as may be necessary the principle and scope of the East African Guaranteed Loans Act. (The third of the suggestions of the Hilton Young Committee.) Experience suggests that two amendments are required in the conditions governing the raising of money under that Act. There should be power to pay out of capital and to add to the loan interest accruing during the period of construction or during such initial period as the project cannot be remunerative. And there should be power to extend the period of forty years for the repayment of the loan.14. There is a case also for examining the first suggestion of the Hilton Young Committee, that of a development fund provided out of Budget Revenues. It would need, so it is suggested, to be a primary condition of any such project, if it were adopted, that the provision should not be a fixed sum each year, for unless that were so, either there would be a scramble to spend it or it would pile up from year to year, and in either event Parliamentary and other difficulties would arise, as in the case of the Empire Marketing Board. It would be more appropriate to lay down a fixed policy of providing out of Budget Revenues such sum as may be required each year up to a prescribed maximum, such as the finances of the year can afford. This money might be available (a) for loans to colonies and protectorates not otherwise able to finance their own development; and (&amp;) for payment of interest on loans during the unproductive period. For the protection of the Exchequer and the avoidance of political pressure, grants from the fund should be made only on the recommendation of a duly constituted body of Commissioners on the analogy of the Public Works Loan Commissioners, a body of business men.Such a project has, primd facie, a good deal to commend it. But as it would involve a considerable extra burden on the Exchequer, the actual necessity for it needs more examination.(ii.) Memorandum by the Colonial Office.1. The full recommendation of the Conference, which is to be found on page 15 of the Report, is that: &quot; By the formation of a Crown Colonies Development Committee, administered on the same lines as Trade Facilities, schemes of develop-ment in the Crown Colonies involving considerable expenditure on equipment manufactured in Britain could be undertaken.&quot;No indication is given in the Report as to the exact terms of reference which would be assigned to such a Colonial Development Committee, nor is there anything to show what its personnel would be, but, in view of the reference to Trade Facilities, it might be assumed that, generally speaking, the functions and composition of the proposed Colonial Development Committee would not be very dissimilar from those of the now defunct Trade Facilities Act Advisory Committee.2. Before considering the vexed question of Colonial development as a means of promoting the relief of unemployment in this country, it may be convenient to set out in some detail the history of the previous experience which the Colonial Office has had of development schemes under the Trade Facilities Acts.
3. Section 2 of the Trade Facilities Act, 1924, gave effect to the Resolution of the Imperial Economic Conference of 1923 on the subject of financial assistance towards Imperial development. Copies of the Act were sent to Colonial Governments in August 1924; the Secretary of State explained the scheme and requested Governors to submit proposals to him. Difficulties arising in connection with the fulfilment of the statutory conditions (a) that the expenditure involved in the scheme should be in anticipation of expenditure which would normally have been incurred at a later date; and(&amp;.) that the application of the proceeds of the loan in the manner proposed was calculated to promote employment in the United Kingdom,made it impossible for the majority of Colonial Governments to put forward any schemes, or for the Trade Facilities Act Advisory Committee to accept such schemes as were put forward. It appeared, however, that certain schemes of development by private enterprise in Colonies were assisted by the Committee.4. In the Report of the Advisory Committee, dated the 28th January, 1926, on the work of the scheme, it was stated that: &quot; The Commission feel that to make a grant in order to induce someone to carry out to-day work which is not economically necessary until to-morrow is in itself unsound, while the benefit as regards employment is open to some dispute since the employment which is given to-day clearly cannot also be given to-morrow.&quot;The sentence last quoted overlooks the fact that the works contemplated would lead to a continued demand for British goods and, therefore, to continued employment.The Committee recommended certain alterations in the terms of the Act, but the consent of the Treasury to their proposals was withheld. The Treasury view was that several of the Committee&apos;s proposals involved a reversal of policy deliberately adopted in 1924, and that in any case, having regard to the paramount need for economy and the steps which were being taken to enforce it as regards local authorities in this country, more favourable terms, e.g., on &quot; anticipation,&quot; to public utility undertakings overseas, could certainly not be contemplated. &quot; Anticipation &quot; was, in fact, the essential principle of the Trade Facilities Act and of the Resolution of the Imperial Economic Conference, 1923, in which the Act had its origin.5. In 1926 the Colonial Office again considered the question of financial assistance from the Imperial Government for schemes of development in the Colonies, Protectorates, &amp;c, and the following telegram was sent on the 13th August to all Dependencies : &quot; My circular despatch, 14th August, 1924. I should be glad if you would at an early date carefully go into question whether, and if so what, opportunities are likely to arise within next few years of being able to make use of financial assistance for local schemes of development on approximately similar conditions as those in Section 2 (1), Trade Facilities Act, 1924. Under that Act schemes cannot be considered after May next year; but, if likely to be useful, I would put forward proposals for continuance of financial assistance up to f interest charges for period of five years in pursuance of policy recommended by Imperial Economic Conference, 1923.  Please send earliest possible reply.&quot;Nothing came of this scheme, however, as, after considering the replies which were received from various Colonial Governments, and laving regard to the financial position in this country, the Department felt that ah approach to the Treasury, as contemplated in the telegram of the 13th August, would be useless.6. The question was again investigated in./ connection with the work of the Industrial Transference Board, whose Report was presented to Parliament in July 1928 (Cmd. 3156). The Inter-departmental Committee which was appointed to assist the Industrial Transference Board consulted the Colonial Office as to whether there were any services of possible benefit to employment in this country which could be arranged either (a) by guaranteed loan; or(p) by assistance in the form of freedom of interest for a period. [19066] k
7. The following is an extract from the Progress Report of the Interdepartmental Sub-Committee (Confidential I.T.B. 6.), dated the 20th February, 1928 : &quot; (4.) The Colonial Office view is that there is little or no field for an extension of Trade Facilities in the overseas territories of the Empire, with the exception possibly of the Middle East. A proposal that the British Government should guarantee a loan to provide new capital for the development of the Iraa railway system has been referred to the Cabinet. If the proposal is rejected the possibility of a Trade Facilities loan would merit consideration.&quot; The Colonial Office also suggest that the possibility of a Trade Facilities Loan might in due course be considered in connection with a projected railway from Haifa to Baghdad, detailed proposals in regard to which are at present awaited.&quot;This Report also contained the following notes on the expenditure of the Palestine and East Africa Guaranteed Loan* : The approval of services for execution under the East Africa Guaranteed Loan lies between the Treasury and the Colonial Office. Good progress has been made with all the important works already approved, and as others depend on surveys (now being carried out) which are necessary before approval can be given, it is certain that nothing further can be expected which would affect the unemployment problem during the next twelve or eighteen months.&quot;8. So far as the Colonial Office, therefore, is concerned, experience has been that the efforts which have been made during the last few years to make use of Colonial development as a means of relieving unemployment in this country lead to little but correspondence, committees, and delay. It is probably not realised to wmat extent the Colonies, Protectorates and other Dependencies actually provide employment in this country in the ordinary course of business. It is estimated that the Crown Agents for the Colonies have bought over 33 million pounds&apos; worth of stores in this country during the last five years and over 8 million pounds&apos; in 1927  all out of Colonial funds. These figures admittedly show a very substantial contribution to the problem. During the same five years four Colonies raised over  18,000,000 by way of development loans, and of this amount some  7,000,000 at least has gone in buying goods here. Over and above that sum of  7,000,000, which comes directly and immediately back, a further considerable part of the  18,000,000 has been spent in the salaries of Europeans, a large proportion of which is spent in the United Kingdom, while the remainder goes to swell the purchasing power of the natives. In a country like Nigeria, for example, where about 70 per cent, of the imports are from the United Kingdom, a considerable proportion, again, of the money spent out of a development loan must find its way back to the United Kingdom. That this expenditure also has indirectly developed new valuable markets is clearly borne out by the steady expansion of British export trade to countries like Nigeria.9. It is more than probable that we have proceeded on the wrong lines in our recent attempts at speeding up development by way of a partnership enterprise. We have asked too much of the Colonies, and have offered too little ourselves for what is, after all, our problem, arid unless we change these lines we shall continue to arrive at the same negative results when the Colonies are asked to do more than they are already doing.Further, each time the Colonial Office has been asked to produce material in connection with the unemployment problem it has been treated as if it were an exceptional emergency or crisis ,to be dealt with by special measures taken in a hurry. On the one hand, we have been vsked to produce proposals for putting in hand large Public Works (which obviously call for a great deal of surveying and preliminary work) to enable the Home Government to deal with the problem of distress in the coming winter. On the other hand, we have been offered terms which have never seemed to us to have been sufficient to induce Colonial Governments to make additional efforts, the effect of whicn would be appreciable. It is no use looking for such help if the British Government are going to ask the Colonies to accept liabilities* The Palestine and East Africa Loans Act, passed in 1926, authorised a guarantee by His Majesty *s Government in respect of loans up to  4,500,000 in the case of Palestine, and  10,000,000 in the case of the Governments of Kenya, Uganda, Northern Rhodesia, Nyasaland and the Tanganyika Territory for the following purposes: railway, harbour construction, and port improvements; roads and other development works, including scientific research.
in the shape of debt charges for enterprises which are not ripe for execution, because it is obvious that, if the construction of a railway or a bridge will be an immediately remunerative undertaking, any solvent Colony is only too anxious to build it without pressure from this end. If the Imperial Government wishes to come to business, it must offer, on loans raised in approved cases for development, payment of the whole interest (say) for a&quot; period of five years, and possibly half or three-quarters interest for a longer period until the revenue from the development accrues to the Colony. Further, if a real long-range policy is to be framed, it must be realised at the outset that the question is not one of how to deal with a temporary emergency or even with crises which recur intermittently. The trade depression and unemployment in the heavy industries in this country must be regarded as an economic factor of some permanence, and must be tackled by a continuous policy and not by spasmodic efforts on short notice, from time to time.10. It is therefore suggested as a possible solution of the problem that a certain sum of money should be placed at the disposal of the Colonial Office as a Colonial Development Fund for a series of years, which would be used to meet the interest charges in whole or in part on schemes of development in Colonies and Protectorates undertaken with the definite view of providing markets for the home manufacturer and employment for home labour. The provision of the money suggested would show the Colonial Governments that His Majesty&apos;s Government recognises the fact that the Colonies and Protectorates are being asked to do something for us. On the other hand, it would mean expending a known annual figure, which is preferable to incurring the indeterminate liabilities involved in a guarantee. The Colonial Office hope that the Committee will give this idea their sympathetic consideration, as they feel that on examination it will be found that in its direct effect the scheme will be cheaper than the old ones, leaving out of account altogether its indirect effect in helping engineering firms to take on other contracts.11. The arrangement suggested would apply only to such works as the Depart-ment could sanction as being undertaken in anticipation of the ordinary programme on definite grounds of public policy, viz., the creation of a present demand for British industrial produce, and not to works which would, in any case, have been undertaken at once or at an early date in the ordinary way. In particular, the Department thinks that most, if not all, of the works which are hereafter approved for construction in East Africa under the Palestine and East Africa Guaranteed Loans Act would be included in the scope of this proposal, and are confident that the assistance thus given would turn the scale in the direction of making practicable many services which, without such assistance, will not be undertaken. They think, indeed, that it would be justifiable to apply this suggestion to works under that Act which have already been authorised, and so set free revenue which would enable the Governments concerned to take in hand sufficient undertakings beneficial to employment at home.12. It will be remembered that the whole basis of the recommendations of the East Africa Commission of 1925,* that the total figure should be  10,000,000, rested on the assumption that interest for the first five years would be found by HisMajesty&apos;s Government. The rejection of this basis has made it impossible to proceed with any long-range development projects under this Act. Less than  3,500,000 of the  10,000,000 has been spent in three years.13. It would be difficult to produce figures in connection with the proposal made until the Colonial Governments are consulted and a programme of works to be gradually brought under the scheme drawn up; but the amount which the Depart-ment consider might well be allocated to the Colonial Development Fund should ultimately be at least  1,000,000, in which, however, might be included the  250,000 a year now spent by the Treasury in grants-in-aid to backward Colonies and Protectorates. Here again, however, only a relatively small amount could be usefully spent in the first year, say,  200,000 new money (making with the grants-in-aid a total for 1929-30 of  450,000). The bulk of this ultimate annual grant of  1,000,000 would be expended, on the advice of a Committee or Board, comprising commercial and technical members, under the Secretary of State for the Colonies, in the payment of whole or part of the interest for a certain number of years on loans for railways and other public works in the Colonial Empire in order to expedite their construction or promote other schemes of general development.[19068]* Omd. 2387.
14. Given a free hand in applying this sum to useful works, the Department believe that they could undertake to ensure such development, particularly in Africa, as would give a real impetus to heavy industry at home, and create a permanently increased trade purchasing power in Africa as a growing market for all varieties of manufactured goods.(iii.) Memorandum by Ministry of Labour on Trade Facilities.1. The Report suggests the revival of the Trade Facilities Act, with a view to accelerating (presumably by some compulsion where necessary) schemes of financial amalgamation and productive reorganisation. The argument is that the industries most in need of reorganisation are depressed; they find difficulty in obtaining fresh money except at onerous rates. Rationalisation is essential if they are to survive, and the markets which are a condition of their health will only be regained if they are reorganised and amalgamated. It is not enough to say that &quot;it is markets they need, not capital.&quot; They will not obtain the markets without capital expenditure.2. The immediate effect of rationalisation, including reorganisation of methods of production and centralised direction through financial amalgamation, would probably be the discharge of non-effective labour, and the increase temporarily of the figures of wholly unemployed. The nominal personnel attached to e.g., cotton, coal, iron and steel, shipbuilding and probably wool is too large, but so long as the nominal &quot;attachment&quot; persists, the men do not recognise the need of alternative employment and tend to sit in at home eking out a livelihood by spells of irregular employment often given out of compassion by employers anxious to give as many as possible the benefit of the work available. Every slight and short-lived spurt in employment-is regarded as the sign of a return to full activity. The employment position in coal, where rationalisation has already gone some way, is much healthier than at any time since 1926. The extent of the true unemployment is gradually being measured; it is being seen as a series of problems of differing types of workmen, for whom differing treatment is necessary, instead of appearing as a mass of good material which is temporarily going through a bad time. And even if the first result is to increase the number surplus to requirements, there is an advantage in the better appreciation of its meaning by the displaced workmen.3. Similarly in the other trades, the gradual definition of a recognised &quot; surplus &quot; would help to clear up the position, quite apart from the strengthening of the economic health of the industry that would follow.4. Therefore, although the first effect of rationalisation might be an increase in the numbers unemployed, the Ministry of Labour consider that the argument and suggestion of the Report deserve full and impartial consideration. Rationalisation is good; it is clearly desirable that any financial or legislative hindrances to the process that are within the control of the State should be removed. The question whether the State should be asked to put financial assistance at the disposal of industries in order to accelerate the rate at which rationalisation is going on 1&apos;aises large general issues affecting financial policy, and raises the whole question of the effects of State interference in industry.(iv.) Memorandum by Ministry of Labour on Crown Colonies Development.The Report refers (p. 15) to &quot; the greater stimulation of the immediate purchasing power .... in the Dominions, India and the Crown Colonies,&apos;&apos; and in this connection suggests that by the formation of a Crown Colonies&apos; Development Committee, administered on the same lines as Trade Facilities, schemes of develop-ment in the Crown Colonies involving considerable expenditure on equipment manufactured in Britain could be undertaken. In so far as these schemes resulted in the placement in this country of orders for railway and bridge materials, rolling-stock and other equipment involving the use of iron and steel, they are clearly attractive. From the unemployment point of view, so great would be the gain resulting from any stimulus to the heavy trades, that it would seem worth while to examine again the extent to which increased capital expenditure in the Crown
Colonies is feasible, and to face some risk of loss of interest during the earlier period of development.There seems to be general consent that in these areas the British Commonwealth has important commercial and economic assets, both as sources of raw material required for various industries, and ultimately as valuable markets in which this country will have the same favourable position&apos; as it had in the earlier development of Australia and Canada of being first on the spot.The present rate of development of those areas is slow, principally because the development must be financed broadly on the existing financial position of the areas subject to the facilities for capital expenditure which the East African loan provides.If this is the only safe basis on which capital expenditure can be permitted in those areas, obviously within the next two or three years Crown Colonies and Protectorates will be able to make very small contribution to the employment position here. It is, however, worth examination whether a much higher rate of capital expenditure could not safely be permitted, e.g., on transport facilities, not necessarily through the administration of those areas, but by enlisting business assistance on some guarantee of capital and interest.Chapter XIX. Recommendation 7: Export Credits.Memorandum by the Treasury.1. The report recommends that &quot;with the objective of the greater stimulation of the immediate purchasing power at home as well as in the Dominions, India and the Crown Colonies, every effort should be made in all available directions to develop Britain&apos;s overseas trade. To achieve this purpose Export Credits should be extended in reasonable cases.&quot; The report notes with satisfaction that a Government Committee is now sitting to review the position.2. The Export Credits Scheme has been considerably altered since it was started in 1919. The original scheme took the form of advances by the Board of Trade in respect of goods exported up to an amount outstanding at any time of  26 millions, a figure which has never been approached in practice. As it now stands it has been brought into line with the normal procedure for financing trade, viz., the scheme provides for the Government guarantee of bills drawn by traders in respect of exports to countries included in the scheme.3. The main lines of the scheme now in force were settled by a Committee representative of commercial and banking interests, which reported in 1926. Their principal findings were- (a) that a demand existed for the insurance of credits for export trade, whichwas not unsound in character;(b) that the existing facilities were not adequate to meet the demand;(c) that their extension would be beneficial to the export trade of this countryprovided that due caution is exercised to avoid encouraging unsound business.4. The amended scheme was put in force in July 1926. Under it the Export Credits Guarantee Department may, subject to the advice of an Advisory Committee, indemnify exporters against risk on a bill, without recourse against the exporter, up to 75 per cent, of the amount of the bill. This is the maximum liability which the State accepts without recourse to the exporter in the event of loss. The Department also provides purely financial facilities by guaranteeing 100 per cent, of a bill with full recourse. Any intermediate form of accommodation may be given subject to the maximum State risk of 75 per cent. The scheme therefore possesses a maximum of elasticity.  The premiums charged are on a scale varying with the risk involved.5. The Committee of 1926 took the view that State assistance should be regarded as arising in consequence of the still somewhat abnormal financial conditions which affect the export trade, and they thought that the scheme should not be continued beyond September 1929 so far as new business is concerned.
It was, however, towards the end of 1927 decided to extend the period during which guarantees may be given up to September 1931, and an Act making this extension has just received Royal Assent.6. The working of the scheme was examined in 1928 by the Select Committee on Estimates, who were of opinion that these facilities were of great practical advantage to the Export Trade of this country. following certain recommendations of the Select Committee, a Committee was set up at the end of 1928, under the Chairman-ship of Sir 0. E. Niemeyer, to consider the administration of the scheme and to suggest any changes in its general working which are likely to facilitate the final transference of the business from Government control.7. The above summary shows that steps have been taken to amend and expand the scheme from time to time on the advice of commercial and banking experts. Whether the scheme is capable of further improvements with advantage to the export industries of this country should emerge from the enquiry now on foot. There is no present indication that it can be improved.8. The Report offers no suggestion beyond &quot; extension in reasonable cases.&quot; It is, however, obvious that no scheme of this sort will bring into being additional orders by foreign purchasers; all that it can be expected to do is to encourage our exporters to accept certain orders to which some risk attaches, and to enable them in certain cases to quote somewhat finer prices. Energetic steps have been taken by the Department to bring to the notice of exporters the facilities which are offered. Close cooperation has been established with Chambers of Commerce and similar bodies and explanatory pamphlets have been widely issued.9. Further, the Department has, in consultation with bankers and others, recently produced two types of Floating Contract. Under Contract A an exporter can obtain cover on each of the markets with which he is doing business on the basis of bills of exchange. The Department agrees to guarantee bills drawn by the exporter on a list of customers in the particular market up to a specified total amount. The contract normally covers shipments over not more than six months forward. An exporter can therefore examine offers of business by a foreign buyer, knowing in advance that he will be covered on that name up to certain limits. Under Contract B the object aimed at is to assist the exporter in obtaining financial facilities from his bank, as well as insuring 75 per cent, of his risk. The Contract is similar to Contract A, save that the guarantee is given to the exporter&apos;s bank.10. The business done is substantial, and it has shown great expansion during recent months. Under the Guarantee scheme, in force from July 1921, the guarantees given amounted to  6,305,000. Under the present scheme, in force from July 1926, the Department has approved applications for guarantees to a total of  4,532,000, while the guarantees actually given amount to  2,367,000. These figures represent, of course, only the percentage of risk which the Department has insured; the amount of business actually involved is much larger.11. The view of the Treasury on the scheme is that it is of distinct advantage to the export industries of this country, in that it develops a form of insurance which commercial interests have not yet taken up in this country to any large extent. It is, however, most desirable that the scheme should, if possible, be handed over to private enterprise if and when opportunity offers. In the meantime it should be administered on sound commercial lines, in order to facilitate such a transfer. It is, moreover, in view of our international commercial relations and the fear of countervailing duties, essential that it should not be suspected of being a form of bounty to particular export trades. One of the obvious objections to continued Government control is that it acts as a constant stimulus to other exporting countries to give their export industries some form of Government support. If all the big commercial powers had fully developed Government export credits organisations, the advantage of the system to our trade would be much reduced.12. There does not appear to be any direction at the moment in which the scheme can be further developed. It applies to all markets except Russia, and, so far as textiles are concerned, India and the Far Eastern markets. The present enquiry by the Niemeyer Committee should, however, show whether any further developments can be adopted with advantage to industry.
Chapter XX. Recommendation 9: Development Fund.Memorandum by the Treasury.1. The Report suggests that &quot;the plan of establishing a Development Fund which would effect a real stimulation of industry in times of depression should be favourably considered.....     Such a fund would have some effect upon theoperation of the trade cycle.....   The Government should create and maintain a fund large enough to be used for financing important national schemes.&quot;2. This proposal is vague. It appears, however, merely to envisage the creation of a fund to be used on such works as may appear to be desirable in times of depression.3. Such a Fund can only be created by taxation or by borrowings. The immediate effects, apart from psychological reactions, are much the same in either case. Purchasing power is transferred from the people to the State. Taxation may take more from purchasing power which would have been applied to consumption and less from that which would have been applied to investment. But in the long run, the effective demand for products is diminished by the transfer to the State. That means less employment until the State uses the purchasing power it takes from the people.4. This is the crux of the matter. The existence of the Fund reduces the purchasing power of the people only so long as it is neither spent nor invested nor used in any way by the State. Immediately if is spent or invested the purchasing power is restored to the public. The Melchett-Tillett plan therefore implies that we should borrow or tax heavily in prosperous times, keep the money in a box (like the old German war hoard at Spandau) and spend it in times of depression. Undoubtedly that would steady employment, but it is an absurdly artificial and costly arrangement. Obviously the State would invest the money or, what is the same thing, use it to save other State borrowing. The device is then quite worthless as a means of steadying employment. When money is needed for expenditure on works during a depression the State has to borrow by realising its investments. This means sharp deflation of the purchasing power of the rest of the community, except in so far as there is money lying idle which had not been attracted into Government investments, but which would be attracted by the new Government issue.Chapter XXI. Recommendation 10: Constructional Schemes.Note by the Chairman.The recommendation is that &quot; Further extension of constructional schemes of a permanent character should be undertaken and existing schemes hastened in their application.&quot;This covers in one sentence the whole ground of the pamphlet &quot; We can conquer Unemployment,&quot; and no comment is therefore made on it in this part of our Report.Recommendation 11: Rationalisation.Note by the Chairman.These eminently sound proposals are primarily for industry itself to carry out, and we have not, therefore, thought it necessary to have a separate memorandum prepared on this recommendation, which will, however, be found to be directly and indirectly endorsed in various Departmental memoranda included in this report.
Chapter XXII. Recommendation No. 12: Means should be explored for a more Authoritative Contact between Industry and Agriculture.(i.) Memorandum by Ministry of Agriculture.1. As stated in the Report, the inspiration of this recommendation is to be found in the rapprochement between German industry and German agriculture, which has been brought about largely through the initiative of the Reichsverband der Deutschen Industrie, which is a corresponding organisation to the Federation of British Industries.2. The Reichsverband der Deutschen Industrie has always attached great importance to co-operation with other national organisations for the exchange of ideas on matters of mutual interest, particularly with regard to legislation. Such contacts were, in the first instance, made with representative associations of wholesale and retail distributors, with the banks and with organised labour, but, more recently, a similar measure of co-operation with the National and Central Federations of Agriculture has been accomplished.Although no special organisation has been&apos; established for the purpose, conferences are being convened from time to time between leading German agriculturists and industrialists, at which important issues of mutual interest are discussed, such as the nitrogen industry, the relief of unemployment, the milk supply, the mechanisation of industry, the balance of trade, agricultural co-operation and the financial situation of German agriculture.3. Important questions may sometimes be referred to smaller expert bodies which invoke the assistance of existing research organisations wherever possible. Such questions include the problem of milk supplies, the present state of agricultural technique and the standardisation of agricultural tools and machinery. It is interesting to note that investigations into the production and marketing of milk and meat in Germany have been entrusted to an American commission of research. The results of this Commission^ investigations have not yet been published. On all these questions, close co-operation is maintained between the industrial scientific research organisations and those which deal more specifically with agricultural problems.4. Every attempt is made to give practical effect to the resolutions passed at these conferences between German industry and agriculture. As a result of one of these meetings, for example, a National Committee was formed to promote the consumption of milk, and on this Committee industry is strongly represented. The big industrial federations of the Rhine are members of a special committee for the Rhine and Westphalia, and they do all they can to foster and encourage the milk-supplying establishments which already exist in the works. This policy is also followed in other parts of Germany. The canteens in the works now handle abundant supplies of fresh milk, with the result that the consumption of milk has increased, especially among the younger members of the working classes.5. Mutual understanding and goodwill are also promoted by social functions which are held during the conferences, and by joint visits to agricultural and industrial undertakings. These meetings have undoubtedly helped German agricul-Agriculturists and industrialists to look at their activities from the viewpoint of the national economic welfare as a whole rather than from that of the sectional interests of a single industry. This does not, of course, mean that differences of opinion never occur; but, where they do, the frank exchange of ideas has proved useful in clearing the air and enabling certain points of agreement to be found.German industrialists hold that co-operation with agriculture is indispensable to trade in general, and that the increase in the purchasing power of agriculture, which this co-operation implies, is essential to the extension of the internal market for the products of German industry.6. The idea of closer contact between industry and agriculture is absolutely sound, but at the moment there is no action that the State can usefully take in the matter, except, possibly, to obtain an early and authoritative report from Germany on the progress that has been achieved there, and to give the report wide publicity
here. This publicity would help to bring together the &quot; recognised bodies in Industry and Agriculture,&quot; with a view to these bodies setting up the Standing Committee suggested in the Melchett-Tillett Report.The attitude of the National Farmers&apos; Union is the key to the situation    The Union is never well disposed to the idea of co-operating with other organisations but there Is&apos;no reason to suppose that it would decline to confer with representative industrialists once the significance of the move were fully appreciated.(i;i.) Memorandum- by Board of Agriculture, Scotland.It is assumed that this project has in view a system by which agriculturists and manufacturers and industrial representatives could meet and ascertain at first hand each other&apos;s requirements-each party being at once a producer and consumerIt is doubtful, however, whether a scheme of this kind would be so satisfactory or so practicable as the existing system by which requirements are ascertained through the ordinary channels of trade.Chapter XXIII. Recommendation 13: School Leaving Age.(i.) Memorandum by Board of Education.1. The Melchett-Tillett Report, after suggesting that &quot;the raising of the school-leaving age would help materially to relieve the unemployment situation,&quot; contains a specific recommendation (No. 13) that this question should be further investigated.2. The first point to note is that the raising of the school-leaving age means extending the period during which parents are compelled to keep their children at school. There is nothing to prevent children remaining at school beyond the age of fourteen if they wish to do so, and a certain number do so remain. What the policy of the report represents is that parents should be compelled, whether they like it or not, to keep something like half a million children at school for at least a year longer than they are compelled to keep them at present. Such evidence as there is may be held to indicate that the parents do not desire a raising of the leaving age. Many local authorities find it difficult to enforce even the present law of school attendance under which the child has to attend school until the end of the term in which he reaches the age of 14 years. Out of half a million children who leave the Elementary Schools annually, something like 90 per cent, leave the moment they are legally free to do so. Only about 15,000 have stayed at school until 15. In some places even the selective Central Schools have some difficulty in securing any measure of voluntary attendance. .3. The second point to notice is that this proposal means a general raising of the school leaving age. A Local Education Authority under the existing law may, with the approval of the Board, make a bye-law raising the school-leaving age to 15 within its own area. Out of 317 Authorities for Elementary Education, 4 have made such bye-laws with the Board&apos;s approval, and the Board have intimated to the Authorities their readiness to consider proposals for raising the leaving age in this way. The 4 Authorities who have taken this step, however, have not found it possible to secure more than a very partial enforcement, and they generally have to release any child who can show a &quot;prospect of beneficial employment.4. The Board are not opposed in principle to the raising of the school leaving age, but they have consistently maintained that the age of compulsory attendance should not be generally raised until the children who are to be compelled to remain longer at school can be provided with an education suitable to their requirements. There are two main reasons why this condition is not fulfilled at present. The first is an educational reason, and the second is the difficulty of providing accommodation and equipment.
5. On educational grounds it is essential that, before the leaving age is raised to 15, the schools should be able to offer instruction of the type required. In con-sidering this question we have to remember that since the War the school age has been raised to 14, and that the result has been to make more evident than before the inability of the majority of the schools to give really satisfactory education to the older children. The Board feel that justice can only be done to these children and their time profitably employed after an extensive scheme of reorganisation and the creation of Senior and Central Schools. This can only be achieved by a very slow process, adapting means to needs, and the sudden imposition of another year of school life would make the task an almost impossible one. The fact is that the raisino-of the school-leaving age to 15 does not merely add a certain number of children to the school roll, but it changes the whole character of the old Elementary School, and it is a change not of degree but of kind. To achieve the reorganisation of the schools which the. Consultative Committee of the Board had in mind, in the Hadow Report, there is need not only for more teachers, but better teachers, tmined especially for facing new and difficult problems. To throw this new responsibility on the present teaching staffs of the authorities wpuld not only create chaos, but would prejudice the future development of the type of school which the Hadow Report described under the title of the &quot; Modern &quot; School. Even if it were possible in some rough and ready way to give some sort of instruction to the children in the towns it would not be possible to do this in the country, and it is obvious that the ordinary village school, so often under a head mistress, would be quite unable to cope with the task of instructing and disciplining boys of the age of 15.6. As regards the question of school accommodation, the accommodation avail-able in many areas is at present inadequate for existing numbers. There are still over 16,000 classes exceeding 50 children, due almost entirely to lack of accommoda-tion. There are also many thousands of classes for older children which exceed 40. Moreover, the Local Authorities and voluntary bodies are faced with the problem of replacing or reconstructing defective school premises; out of 2,800 schools which were included in the Black Lists of defective premises, about 1,000 have now been removed from the lists, or plans which would remedy the defects have been approved. At the present rate of progress it will take another seven years to deal completely with the Black Lists. Local Authorities are further burdened with heavy commit-ments in regard to new housing areas. At present at least half of the Local Authorities&apos; expenditure on buildings is devoted to meeting these obligations. The amount of new expenditure on building approved in the financial year now ending will exceed  4,000,000 in cost, easily a record figure. Yet there is very little doubt that considerably increased activity would be necessary if any adequate preparation was to be made for the raising of the school-leaving age during the next few years. The voluntary bodies are already complaining of the strain involved by the present position.  It is difficult to see how they can meet any additional burden.7. It is recognised by the most ardent advocates of the higher school leaving age that something like five years&apos; notice would be necessary, and it is generally admitted that even if legislation were passed in 1930, the actual change could not come into operation until 1935.- But it has been established that if the school age is to be raised, the most inconvenient period to take this step would be the period between the years 1933 and 1936. During those years the number of older children in the elementary schools will reach a very high level in consequence of the abnormally high birth-rate during the years immediately following the war. It has been estimated that the raising of the school leaving age in 1933 would necessitate provision being made for about 350,000 senior children whose places would fall vacant after 1937. This estimate is based on a Report by the Government Actuary on future numbers of children in Public Elementary Schools, which was published by the Board in -Circular 1395.(ii.) Memorandxvm by Ministry of Labour.1. The distribution of juveniles geographically and industrially is dominated by various factors and, as recent enquiries into the shrinkage of the war time birth rate have shown, the numbers of juveniles available for employment in the next few
years vary considerably from place to place and bear no relation to incidence of unemployment among adults.2. At the present time there are certain areas, e.g., in the Midlands and London, where there is little or no juvenile unemployment and in certain cases there is an unsatisfied demand. In other areas, and specially in the districts of heavy industries, mining, and cotton textiles, there is a surplus of unabsorbed boys and girls. In such areas the raising of the school age could not have any appreciable effect on the absorption of adult labour.3. Assuming that the Melchett-Tillett proposal could be put into force, and taking their own figures of substitutes of adults for juveniles and making allowance for unemployed juveniles being absorbed, the additional wages cost would be very-substantial. Reckoning at the very modest wages rates of 15s. for juveniles, 25s. for women and 45s. for men, the excess wages cost would amount to several million pounds.4. A further important consideration arises from the fact that during the next few years the phenomenon of an unprecedented shrinkage in the number of juveniles available for employment annually will occur owing to the shrinkage in the birth rate during the war. Reference is made to this in the Melchett-Tillett report, but without apparent realisation of the extent of the decline. The Balfour Report of 1927 draws attention to the fact and concludes that there are likely to be 259,000 fewer occupied boys and 186,000 fewer occupied girls in 1933 than at the time the Report was written. Although it is also estimated that there will be a recovery in numbers in 1934, this will be followed by a series of years of decline. The adoption of the proposal to raise the school age now in conjunction with the natural decline would produce a reduction in the number of j uveniles available for industry of nearly a million. As a result of the enquiries made by the Ministry of Labour it is shown that the shortages differ materially from district to district.5. The latest information which the Ministry of Labour possesses regarding the effect of any estimated shortage of juvenile labour on the position of the older age groups as regards enhanced opportunities of work is contained in the replies received to a circular issued last year to Juvenile Employment Committees. The question may be conveniently examined on the basis of these reports. It cannot be said that there is any one conclusion that can be drawn from them as regards the effect on the country as a whole of the anticipated shrinkage in the supply over the next few years. It is so largely a question of the needs of each particular district, regard being had to the state of the staple industries in each district. In London and any similar area, where employment both for juveniles and adults is good, the reduced supply may lead, on the one hand, to some adjustment of methods of working, and on the other to migration from other areas.6. Generally it may be said that, if the raising of the school-leaving age were a practicable proposition immediately, there would be serious risk that such a step, at the moment when the supply of juvenile labour will be seriously diminished by reason of the reduced birth-rate during the war years, would constitute quite a serious handicap to industry.7. There is one general point that may perhaps be taken on the possibility of substituting adult for juvenile labour in the event of the possible shortage of juveniles, owing either to raising the school-leaving age or to the reduced birth-rate or to both. Although unemployment amongst juveniles is very much lower than amongst adults, there are always juveniles unemployed. There would inevitably be a &quot;take up&quot; of these juveniles before resort was had to adult labour. Moreover, with the demand, which might be anticipated, there would be quite a likelihood of the greater employment in industry of girls as well as boys where juvenile labour is employed in considerable numbers. Girls, who at present stay at home, would be attracted into the labour market with the result that the opportunites for the employ-ment of adult labour in place of juvenile might well be seriously reduced. Shortly, the effect, so far as the employment of adult labour is concerned, of a reduced supply of juveniles at present ages is highly problematical.
(iii.) Memorandum by Scottish Education Department. Question of Raising the School Age in Scotland.1. Section 14 of the Education (Scotland) Act, 1918, provides that the upper age limit for compulsory attendance shall be raised from 14 to 15 years; and under Section 33 (2) of the Act the provision is to take effect on a day to be appointed by the Scottish Education Department.   No such day has yet been appointed.2. The matter has been closely considered at various times since 1920, with, on each occasion, the same conclusion, viz., that the time for the change, involving, as it does, an addition of about 50,000 to the 800,000 children already in the schools, was not yet at hand. It was realised that the supply of the additional school accommodation and of the additional teachers needed to meet the new requirement was a problem involving many difficult considerations. The nature of the instruction to be given to the children of 12-15 years was felt to be in itself a question of the highest importance and one in which experiment and development were called for. Lastly, the peculiar situation brought about by the exceptionally large number of births in the period 1919-1922, followed by a steady decline thereafter, was obviously a very important factor in determining the date which would be the most opportune for putting the change into operation. It was clear that on all these grounds the problem was one which should not, and indeed could not, be examined merely from the point of view of relieving adult unemployment.The question may now be reconsidered in the light of more recent statistics under the various heads indicated above.Number of Scholars.3. The essential figures are the numbers between the ages of 12 and 15; it is these which will mainly determine the effect of the change under consideration. We have to consider the number of 12-15 scholars that would be in the schools in each year ahead if attendance were made compulsory up to 15, and to compare these numbers with the numbers that are to be expected if attendance between 14 and 15 remains voluntary as at present. For it must not be forgotten that already nearly half the scholars continue their attendance voluntarily beyond the age of 14. Last year the 14-15 group numbered over 45 per cent, of the previous years 13-14 group; and the percentage tends to increase. The change under consideration would, it appears, increase the size of the 14-15 group by about 120 per cent, and this would involve a very serious increase of expenditure, a considerable part of which, as will be seen, would be wasted if the change were introduced prematurely. The relevant figures, estimated on the basis of the birth statistics of previous years but without any attempt at actuarial precision, are as follows: Year (Midsummer). -(1)	Estimated Total Number in Schools, Age 12-15.

The chart in Appendix 1* shows graphically the course and relationship of the figures in columns 2 and 3 over the nine years&apos; period, the lower line corresponding to column 2 and the upper to column 3. In Appendix II a fuller statement is given with explanatory notes.The Accommodation Problem.4. It will be seen that these new estimates confirm the former conclusions, viz. : (a) that in any case, as a necessary consequence of the high birth-rate of the 1919-22 period, the Education Authorities have to face a heavy increase of their burdens after 1931, the demands reaching a climax in 1934;(6) that if (as their statutory duties require them to do) they provide accommodation sufficient for the requirements of 1934 as determined by the existing law of school attendance, they will have made provision not very far short of that which would be needed in 1938 to meet the then requirements as determined by the altered law under considera-tion; and(c) that if the age-limit is raised before 1938, and if the Authorities perform their statutory duties, they will be left with a wasteful surplus of school places on their hands.5. It is interesting to note that the Edinburgh Education Authority have recently made an investigation of the same question for their area, and have independently arrived at much the same results. In their report for the year 1927-28 one of the Authority&apos;s committees came to the conclusion that &quot; if continuous provision is made for the increasing number of children in the Advanced Departments of the schools between the years 1930 and 1933, sufficient school places will have been provided by the latter year to ease the transition to a higher school-leaving age. The number of children not over 14 for whom accommodation will have to be found in 1933 is, it will be observed, not very far short of the number to be provided for in 1938, with a school-leaving age of 15.&quot;6. In considering what is involved by the requirement of accommodation for some 50,000 additional scholars, three facts must be borne in mind: (i.) Some part, indeed, though a small one, of the 50,000 in question could be fitted into accommodation already existing. But the case is not the same as it would be if the added numbers were to be simply distributed over all the various classes of the schools. Coming in at the top of the school system, these new scholars will form a clear addition to the now relatively small section requiring instruction of a special type, (ii.) The existing supply of accommodation for this type of instruction is hardly sufficient even for the existing numbers, and that even in places where there is plenty of elbow-room in the junior classrooms, (iii.) The type of accommodation required is costly. It would be otherwise if the older pupils were merely going to carry on the lessons they have learned up to the age of 12, with perhaps the addition of a language or two. In that case a few lexicons would furnish all the additional equipment needed. But if the teaching is to be such as to justify the retention of the scholars, equipment for all sorts of practical instruction must be proAuded, and the scholars should, where possible, be collected into specially planned central buildings.7. It must be borne in mind that in the last ten years, apart from miscel-laneous arrears left by the War and the post-War restrictions on building, the building problems of most of the Education Authorities have been mainly concerned with the provision of additional accommodation for the more advanced type of education that is required, in one form or another, by the pupils of the 12-15 group. Already in 1919 very many of the secondary schools were over-crowded, and since then not only has the number of pupils technically qualified for &quot;advanced &quot; education increased by over 17 per cent., but new ideas have been introduced as to the character and organisation of such education and the standard -of accommodation that it demands.   As already indicated, the policy of Education* Not printed.
Authorities is generally, except in the more sparsely populated districts, to collect the advanced scholars at centres, for which new accommodation has commonly to be provided. Even by 1930 the Authorities will not all be level with their commitments in this respect quite apart from the increase in the numbers which will ensue in the next three years.8. It is true that over most of the purely rural areas of Scotland the present school provision is not only sufficient for present needs but would enable the Education Authorities to face an increase in the age limit so far at least as accommodation is concerned. But the school population of these parts is only a fraction of the whole, and it must be remembered that the Authorities of the urban districts which would be most affected by the change are just the Authorities who are most beset with accommodation difficulties arising from other causes, especially the shifting of population to the new housing areas, and, in the west, the burden of a growing Roman Catholic population, for which the schools transferred to the Authorities ten years ago were even then inadequate in size and structural condition. Finally, it has to be remembered that the urban areas in question have enjoyed the smallest share of relief from the general decline in the school population, for, in spite of industrial depression, there appears to be still a certain amount of drift into.the big towns. All these difficulties those which exist and those which the new requirement would add to them are to be found in an extreme form in the Glasgow education area (containing 23 per cent, of the school population of Scotland) and in only a less degree in the urban parts of Lanarkshire, Renfrewshire and Ayrshire (these counties, with Glasgow, contain nearly half the school population).9. To impose the new requirement on such areas at short notice would create a situation full of difficulty. To proceed with all the undertakings which the Authorities have already before them and at the same time to do what would be necessary in order to meet the new requirement, would involve an increase of local expenditure which the ratepayers could hardly be asked to bear. The moribund Education Authorities would naturally be disposed to shelve the duty, and their successors would not be likely to address themselves to it actively until they had had ample time to look about them. In the meantime, alternatives would be found in exemptions, over-size classes, double-shifts or mere disregard of the regulations.The Staffing Problem.10. To provide staff for about 50,000 additional scholars, if they had to be dealt with as an independent block, would involve the formation of at least 1,400 classes, requiring considerably more than that number of teachers. The actual conditions would, of course, be rather different, but we may reckon that from 1,000 to 1,200 new teachers would be required. What has already been said in paragraph 6 in reference to the type of accommodation required applies to the type of staffing : the teachers must have special qualifications to teach science, drawing, mechanical science, rural science, domestic science, commercial subjects and the like. In this respect the rural districts which offer less difficulty as regards accommodation would be more difficult to provide for than the towns. A further point to note, and a highly important one, is that at least half the required teachers should be men. There would therefore be an addition of between three and four hundred thousand pounds to the present salary bill of seven millions a year. The cost, however, is only one side of the question. Buildings can be supplied if the cost can be faced, but where is the supply of teachers to come from ? The general supply of teachers is at present rather in excess of the general demand, and the raising of the school-age has been urged in some quarters as a means of absorbing the surplus. But the unemployed teachers , are all women, and few women, if any, are unemployed who would be really suited for the kind of employment under consideration. Three-quarters of the whole existing supply of teachers are women ; there is even now a slight dearth of men for the posts which demand men, and the present rate of output from the training colleges is not diminishing the deficiency. It is evident, therefore, that special measures, demanding a fairly long period of notice, would be necessary in order to-
produce five or six hundred additional men trained for this work. The training could be provided, but the recruitment of candidates is another matter. An increase of the national salary scales might have to be considered. All these facts must be taken into consideration in order to realise how different would be the effect of applying the new compulsory rule in 1934 and deferring its application till 1938 when the number of children in question will have dropped by about 45,000 below that of the peak year.The Instruction.11. This aspect of the problem has to a certain extent been anticipated. But it is worth repeating that before compulsion is exercised, some form of 12-15 curriculum that will commend itself not only to educational experts but to parents, employers, and not least to the children themselves should have established itself firmly under the voluntary system. The employers are asked to sacrifice their cheap juvenile labour, the parents their children&apos;s earnings. Both must be made to feel that it is worth while. A compulsion exercised upon a large mass of ratepayers who do not believe in the virtue of what is demanded is most undesirable. And if the children have any general feeling that they are wasting their time and ought to be out in the real world (a feeling specially to be expected at 14-15), then the additional school year will be almost a waste of time and money. But if, gradually, a system under which schemes of work, teachers, accommodation, equipment adequate to the special call of the three post-qualifying years can be evolved under an organisation which is voluntary in what is the really testing year of instruction, then the eventual transition to compulsion will not only be eased administratively and financially, but may commend itself to all classes of the community.Maintenance Allowances.12. If one thing is more certain than another, it is that the raising of the school age will give a great impetus to the demand for maintenance allowances for all children over fourteen and even over twelve. Will the working classes have it at any other price ? Too many advocates of the change - discuss the question as if, at present, the doors of the school were automatically closed upon children as soon as they reach their fourteenth birthday. In point of fact, education for all between fourteen and fifteen is available to-day free. The neglect to take advantage of it is due to various causes. One of these is the anxiety of parents to utilise their children as wage-earners. That obstacle could be surmounted by the provision of maintenance allowances, but only at great cost.13. It remains to be considered whether it would be feasible to confine the imposition of the requirement, at any rate at the outset, to selected areas. On general grounds this would not be desirable. Employers would complain of economic differentiation, local authorities and parents of unequal and invidious treatment. Further, the educational argument of paragraphs 10 and 11 above is equally applicable to all parts of the country. And, so far as relieving unemploy-ment is concerned, those areas in which that is at its worst, are exactly the areas in which the accommodation difficulties are at present most serious.14. There is more to be said for bringing the requirement into effect by, say, two instalments after the peak years have been passed, i.e., increasing the age to 14J at one date and 15 at a later date. The change could thus be spread over the years 1934-38 when the number of senior pupils is steadily declining.

The total in column 4 is the sum of columns 1 and 2, but it will be observed that the total in column 5 is not the precise sum of columns 1 and 3,   The explanation is as follows:  The figures in column 1 make allowance for the normal percentage of scholars of the 13-14 group who are exempted from school attendance before completing their 14th year (exemption between 12 and 13 is neg-ligible). It has been assumed that under the new compulsory law such exemption would be shifted from tbe 13-14 group to the 14-15 group, and accordingly the figures in column 3 make allowance for such exemption. But if the figures in column 5 were composed by simply adding column 3 to column 1, the allowance for exemption would have been made twice over. To avoid this, column 3 has been added, not to column 1, as it stands, but to column 1 plus the amount actually deducted on accouut of exemption. As the 14-15 group is smaller by about -5 per cent, than the previous year&apos;s 13-14 group, through normal wastage, it follows that the exemption reduction applies to a slightly smaller number at the 14-15 stage than at the 13-14 stage.Chapter XXIY, Recommendations 14 and 15 (Monetary Policy).Memorandum by the Treasury.1. The Conference recommends that &quot; a Government enquiry into currency and banking policy, to be participated in by representatives of industry and finance, should be undertaken immediately,&quot; and that &quot; every effort should be made by the Treasury and the Bank of England to have the recommendations of the Genoa Conference put into operation.&quot;2. The grounds given for these recommendations in the body of the Report are that &quot; the basic factor of the short and long term cycles of activity and depression&quot; is &quot;intimately connected with monetary policy.&quot;    Therefore &quot;it is
felt that the currency and banking policy of the Treasury and the Bank of England should be so framed as to take into more complete account the requirements of industry and to eliminate or as the essential minimum, to lessen considerably the incidence and effects of such fluctuations.&quot; The Conference considers, therefore, that &quot; the currency and banking policy pursued by the Treasury and the Bank of England ought in future to be framed in such a way that the special interests of industry are safeguarded and furthered. How this may best be done, with due regard for other interests and for financial and administrative soundness, can only be determined after full enquiry. The opinion is therefore reiterated that such an enquiry, to be participated in by representatives of industry competent to speak for emploj^er and worker, as well as by representatives of the banks and financial houses, should be undertaken by the Government as soon as possible.&quot;3. The view that the so-called cycles of trade activity and depression are wholly or mainly due to monetary causes is not by any means self-evident and it is probably not well founded. There are a number of factors besides monetazy policy which affect prices : in particular, physical causes such as variations in seasons bringing heavy crops or scarcity, new discoveries of mineral wealth, &amp;c.; mechanical causes such as new inventions and labour-saving devices, transport facilities and psychological causes, affecting the activity of consumption, all play important parts, and it is a profound mistake to suppose that the mere manipulation of monetary policy can afford any sure and certain remedy for industrial depression. Admittedly an unwise banking policy may encourage instead of discouraging such cyclical variations as are harmful and avoidable, but this is so well known to-day by instructed financial authorities that it needs no emphasis here.4. Moreover, it is by no means certain that industrialists are the best judges of national credit policy. They, or many of them, are apt to be prejudiced in favour of an increase of prices, or at least to resist any decrease of prices. But it by no means follows that a fall in the price level of, e.g., wheat or cotton or any other commodity, due to an expansion of supply, is undesirable : and it would be contrary to the national interest that monetary policy should be directed to preventing or counteracting a decline of prices due to such a cause. The country consists of consumers as well, as of producers, and in any event our credit policy must be soundly based upon convertibility.5. The Treasury is, of course, not now responsible in any way for credit policy; with the passage of the Bank Notes Act of last year, this is now completely in the hands of the Bank of England. The Melchett-Tillett recommendations, no doubt, contemplate that the Bank of England should be placed under some outside control, in the interests of industry, if not of politics. But there is no reason to believe that such an alteration is desirable. In order to maintain the right credit policy, a Central Bank must be prepared not only to resist political but also industrial pressure. It must on occasion face a restriction of credit in order to prevent an undue expansion of prices and a collapse of our exchanges. Neither the industrialists nor the Joint Stock Banks are in a position to express impartial views on such occasions, and the controlling authority must be independent if it is to be effective. It should, of course, take into account all the relevant data bearing on prices, trade, exchanges, &amp;c, at home and abroad, tracing their causes and estimating their effects, as a step to the formulation of its policy. But there is every reason to believe that the Bank of England takes all these factors into account already. Parliament having only recently been persuaded to give back the complete control of credit to the Bank of England, it would be a great mistake to revive controversy by having a further enquiry into the economic repercussions of monetary policy and industry.6. No doubt there are still critics who are prepared to maintain that our unemployment troubles have been unnecessarily increased, if not induced, by the rapidity with which we reverted to the gold standard. The theoretic merits of this question might be debated ad infinitum, but the policy of returning to the gold standard was adopted four years ago with the support of all parties, and there can be no question of turning back. Our monetary policy is now definitely and irrevocably dependent on world conditions, and no practical purpose can be served by having a further inquest on the subject. This aspect of the matter has been well dealt with by the Balfour Committee on Industry and Trade in pp. 55-56 of [19066]    &apos; p
their Final Report. The Committee point out that whatever the effect of the resumption of the gold standard during the transitional period, &quot; such effect tends to exhaust its force with the lapse of time, and it is unthinkable that any appreciable body of opinion would favour a fresh departure from the gold standard, with all the renewed disturbance to trade and labour which such a departure would involve.&quot; &quot;This view,&quot; the Committee said, &quot;is fully shared by those Members of the Committee who have been disposed to doubt whether the actual return to the gold standard was not too precipitate, and whether it would not have been possible and desirable to ease the economic difficulties ofthe transition.....It cannot be doubted that certain of the difficulties havebeen smoothed over by some such devices, but this advantage would have been bought at a heavy price by prolonging the period of uncertainty and fluctuatingexchange.....Whether on balance this price would have been excessive for therelief thus obtained is a question on which there will probably always be difference of opinion, and it seems to us unprofitable so long after the event to argue the matter in detail. It suffices that the gold standard has been restored on its pre-war basis and that no one would dream of disturbing the settlement so arrived at.&quot;7. There is more to be said for the second recommendation that all possible steps should be taken to give effect to the Genoa Resolutions. In principle this recommendation is entirely in accord with actual policy. If an increase of prices is wanted, it is not an increase of internal prices in this country alone, but a general increase in the level of world prices, and the possibility of this or of steady prices depends on the general relations maintained between the supply of and demand for gold throughout the world. The question whether fluctuations in the value of gold can be prevented in the future by means of international arrange-ments (as proposed at the Genoa Conference) is being studied by the Financial Committee of the League of Nations, and it is hoped that a special Committee may be set up in the near future to explore the possibilities of agreement on the subject. But at present the intensity of international jealousy is such that no very definite pi&quot;ogress can be made in this matter, and any suggestions volunteered by this country would be likely to make matters worse and not better.8. On this subject, too, the final Report of the Balfour Committee contains some valuable conclusions with which the Treasury are in the fullest accord. The Committee state (p. 57) that they have already discussed in the chapter on Industrial Fluctuations in &quot; Further Factors in Industrial and Commercial Efficiency,&quot; pp. 257-66, the possibility of taking measures, either nationally or by international accord, to promote stability of prices through stabilising the commodity value of gold.&quot; .... &quot; The Genoa Conference of 1922 contemplated an international conference of Central Banks of Issue, to be convened by the Bank of England, with the object of arriving at an agreement for the above purposes.&quot; . . . . &quot; Any such formal conference would in existing circumstances be premature, and it might have the unfortunate effect of bringing to an end the informal exchanges of views between the governing authorities of the various Central Banks, from which very valuable results have already accrued and further advantages may be expected in the future.&quot; .... &quot; We can only confirm the view we have previously expressed, that in present circumstances a formal conference or negotiation would be unlikely to yield fruitful results, while its failure might prove a serious set-back.&quot; On the other hand, &quot; very high importance is to be attached to the gradual, patient and persistent development of the habit of personal intercourse and co-operation among those in control of the Central Banks, based on the recognition that in the largest sense the monetary and economic interests of the different countries of the world are more nearly identical than opposed.&quot;&quot; It cannot be too strongly emphasized that what is needed is not the elaboration of a formula (which of itself might easily be worse than useless), but the growth of a new habit of confidential communication and friendly support among those responsible for the administration of national monetary policy in the various countries. In a matter like this, in which the pre-war tradition was one of isolation, mutual confidence is a plant of tender growth, which can easily be withered by the blast of premature publicity. We desire in this connexion to record our appreciation of the action already begun by the Governor of the Bank of England in concert with his foreign colleagues, and to express the hope that it will be strenuously and continuously pursued independently of all changes of bank personnel.&quot;
PART IV.Chapter XXV. Summary of Departmental Memoranda on &quot;We can Conquer Unemployment.&quot;CHAPTER II (pages 4-12). General Memorandum by Ministry of Labour.I. 1. The statistics of unemployment are examined, and it is shewn that &quot; the unemployed&apos;&apos; are not a standing army of over 1 million persons, but that the individuals in the total vary largely from week to week. To find the &quot;surplus&quot; available for specially created State schemes there must be deducted those temporarily unemployed and casuals, women and girls, boys for whom the work would be unsuitable and demoralising 483,400 in all. Further, in industries where the percentage of unemployment is 5 or less, the labour, so far as employable, must be regarded as attached to those industries; and further deductions must be made for age, physical suitability, difficulty of employing men with dependants away from their homes, &amp;c. After making all due allowances, the number of males who should be regarded as available for direct employment in State-aided schemes of road work and land drainage under commercial conditions is put at 250,000 to 300,000 only.2.   Turning to the detailed schemes, as regards (i.) Housing. Not 35,000, but possibly 20,000, additional workpeople might be absorbed.(ii.) Telephone and Electrical Development. The extra expenditure proposed appears to be uneconomic, but, ignoring this point, a large additional force would be absorbed. Manufacture of electrical work employs a small number of men per  100 spent owing to cost of material, fineness of work and amount of&apos; machine work.(iii.) London Passenger Transport. If the extensions could be done in a year, the estimate of 24,000 men might not be very wrong..(iv.) Roads amd Land Drainage. Quite different considerations apply to the suggested employment of 350,000 the first year and 375,000 the second on roads and 80,000 each year on drainage. The force of unemployed labour really available is quite inadequate. It would be difficult to avoid drawing off labour from other occupations, e.g., agriculture. Accom-modation difficulties (and consequent wage difficulties) will be great, and add enormously to the cost. Concerted measures of compulsion will be necessary if any serious attempt is to be made to draw off to road works most, if not all, the surplus miners and shipbuilders. Wages and accommodation problems for land drainage works will be even more serious, and it is doubtful if miners would take the work.3. The large force envisaged by the pamphlet does not exist, but there is a substantial number, not less than 250,000 men, who cannot count during the next few years on employment in their own industry or locality and are capable of employment of the kind envisaged.II. A big programme of State-aided public works has a disturbing effect on the general industrial position; it can only be justified (i) if the works are urgently required; or (ii) if they will so improve productive efficiency that their cost will be repaid; or (iii) if they will keep from demoralisation a valuable force confident of reabsorption in its own industry in a short period. Point (iii) was the original conception behind the earlier programme of public works, but it has now been abandoned, and the Industrial Transference Board made it clear that in certain industries there was a permanent surplus.The suggestion that 430,000 men put on roads and land-drainage would quickly be absorbed into normal industry is contested. The existing policy of Transfer, &amp;c, is described and commended as better than the plan of the pamphlet.
III. While the programme in the pamphlet cannot be carried out and is based on a misreading of the unemployment position, a much smaller programme employing, say, 15,000 men for six months could be carried out and would assist the policy of transfer. It would be essential that the work should be carried out under economic conditions in areas where the chance of absorption was good. Such a programme would not mean the acceptance by the State of an obligation to find work, but would be intended to help the men to regain the habit of work and put them in touch with districts where a man, if he tries, can get work.It is to the normal working of ordinary industry that the employable population must look for livelihood, and unless this is made clear the institution of a programme of public works will raise the costs of production in other industries.CHAPTER III (pages 13-24).Roads and Bridges  (Ministry of Transport).1. The pamphlet ignores the great progress which has been made and is in contemplation; payments from the Road Fund for roads have risen from  5 millions in 1920 to  19 millions.2. It is agreed that plans should be made in advance, and most of the schemes in the pamphlet are desirable if carried out over a long term of years. All experience, even with emergency powers, is against the possibility, even if it were desirable or practicable, of compressing the work proposed into two years.The steps required are (i) detailed plans, estimates, &amp;c.; (ii) negotiations with property owners;(iii) work by local authorities (unless they are to be superseded);(iv) consultation with railway and canal authorities.Omission of any of these leads to gross extravagance. Apart from this, to concentrate all the work into two years would involve serious interruption of traffic.As compared with the pamphlets  42 millions on trunk roads in two years, the Department recently worked out a scheme for spending  8 to  10 millions over four or five years.3. The number of men to be employed, both directly and indirectly, for a year per  1 million spent is not likely to reach 5,000, and would be nearer 4,000.4. To a large extent the immediate carrying out of the proposals is extravagant and impracticable, particularly the proposed expenditure of  21 millions on district roads.5.   Some of the schemes in the pamphlet are already in train.6. The drastic acceleration of road programmes would have serious effect on the railways and on industry generally.Betterment (Inland Revenue Department).The absence of a definite scheme in the pamphlet precludes effective examination, but some of the practical difficulties are described. Reference is made to &quot; impairment,&quot; which would have to be considered also.CHAPTER IV (pages 24-36).Housing (Ministry of Health and Department of Health, Scotland).1. The Departments&apos; policy is to re-establish housing as a productive industry, meanwhile ensuring a programme to meet the needs of the homeless and badly housed. The pamphlet ignores the cost of houses.2. Statements of &quot;need&quot; of houses based on arithmetic are misleading in relation to effective demand.
3. Reduction of subsidy has been accompanied by a bigger reduction in cost of houses.4. Progress has been very rapid, in fact, twice as fast as ever contemplated, without any extra burden on the public.5. The pamphlet mis-states the unemployment position in the building industry by taking seasonal figures.6. An increase in houses is not necessarily accompanied by a corresponding increase in building employment. 100,000 more houses were built in 1927 than in 1924, but numbers employed in building were increased by only 20,000.7. The statement that reduction of subsidy is a greater deterrent in Scotland than in England is not confirmed, nor is the statement that Scotland has not had her fair share of money.8. Scotland&apos;s output of assisted houses has quadrupled since 1924. Erom available statistics, an increased output of 5,000 houses is not practicable.CHAPTER V (pages 36-38).Telephone Development.Telephone Development is proceeding at a rapid rate. The under-development is not due to lack of capital but to lack of subscribers, despite intensive and extensive canvassing and the cheapness of the telephone. Our people have fewer telephones than the Americans because they are poorer, just as they have fewer motor cars. Further development is not necessarily economic.CHAPTER VI (pages 38-39).Electrical Development (Ministry of Transport).The scheme appears to be merely an optimistic version of the existing scheme embodied in the 1926 Act. The Electricity Commissioners are doing all they can to push development. The expenditure appears to be in fact already not far short of the  18 million a year desired by the pamphlet, and failing an actual subsidy the Commissioners axe not aware of any financial measures which will assist.CHAPTER VII (pages 40-44). Land Drainage (Ministry of Agriculture and Board of Agriculture for Scotland).It is not correct that nothing has been done and the measures are described. The difficulty about land drainage is that generally speaking it does not pay. But the pamphlet proposes that &quot; land which in any degree benefits shall be required to make due contribution,&quot; which leaves matters where they are.About 4,000 men could be employed for a year on each   million spent, so that 50,000 men would involve  12,500,000 in one year. No account is really taken of legislative difficulties and arguments with authorities.The importation of thousands of men into rural areas would raise acute wage difficulties.CHAPTER VIII (pages 44-48).London Passenger Transport (Ministry of Transport).Most of the proposals have been commended by the London Traffic Advisory Committee, but the chief obstacle to the major schemes of tube electrifications and extensions is lack of co-ordination between the various authorities. Bills promoted By the Underground Companies and the London County Council to secure co-ordination are now before Parliament.[19066] Q 2
Such of the schemes as will pay are likely to be put in hand as soon as the Railways concerned are in a position to take them up.All the schemes require legislation and at least a year must pass between date of decision to embark on a scheme and date of starting work. The various proposals and comments thereon are set out in detail.CHAPTER IX (pages 48-52).Land Reclamation (Ministry of Agriculture, Development Commission, and Boardof Agriculture, Scotland).This is not dealt with in detail in the pamphlet. Reclamation must be slow and it is generally speaking uneconomic. The &quot;recovery for food and livelihood of land in Scotland given over to sport &quot; is of no value for relief of unemployment as the lands give more employment now and their agricultural value is low.CHAPTER X (pages 52-53). Afforestation (Forestry Commission).The Industrial Transference Board recommendation for 1,000 forest workers&apos; holdings &quot;in the next three years&quot; went too far from the Forestry point of view. It is agreed that State afforestation should be steadily extended; the  8 million programme of the Forestry Commission would employ about 4,500 men on an average as against the 3,000 of the approved  5^ million programme, i.e., an increase of 1,500. Afforestation builds up a valuable asset, but there is considerable initial outlay and a disturbance of existing land utilisation though not on a significant scale.CHAPTER XI (pages 53-55).Canals (Ministry of Transport).This topic is not dealt with in detail in the pamphlet. It admits that &quot; develop-ment of motor transport is an important new factor,&quot; and the pamphlet&apos;s vast road programme is inconsistent with any scheme of embarking money on improving Canals. Public Expenditure on Canals may be regarded as discrimination against railways.CHAPTER XII (pages 55-61). Land Settlement (Ministry of Agriculture and Board of Agriculture, Scotland).This topic is dealt with summarily in the pamphlet and no details of actual schemes, cost, employment, &amp;c, are given. Land settlement is very desirable and there are plenty of applicants, but it does not pay for the capital involved. The administrative difficulties are described. A scheme of 200 holdings per annum might be embarked on, but it is a very different problem to deal with 20,000 men per annum in haste and would repeat the extravagances of previous schemes.As regards Scotland, the claim &quot;no addition to National or Local Taxation&quot; is not endorsed. Land settlement, desirable as it is on other grounds, has little bearing on unemployment, being neither substantial, quick, nor inexpensive. Detailed remarks are added.CHAPTER XIII (pages 61-68).Treasury Memorandum on Finance of Development Loans.1. The programme would involve additional capital expenditure of at least  125 millions in each of the next two years. The great bulk will have to be borrowed directly or indirectly on State credit, additional to normal local loans borrowing of about  20 millions in 1929.
ill. The question arises whether the financial reactions would diminish employ-ment in other directions. The pamphlet rules out inflation, but argues that State borrowing for capital investment at home could be met from &apos;&apos; frozen savings &apos;&apos; or from money now going to foreign investments, without diversion from other home investments.3&quot;. The new capital issues are examined, and it is shown that Colonial and foreign investments, which in 1914 averaged  174 millions or 80.7 per cent, of the whole, now average only  108 millions or 37 per cent, of the whole. The claim that large &quot;frozen savings&quot; are available is also not sustained.4. It is unlikely that the  125 millions per year could be found without impinging on the supply of capital for other home requirements. But even if it were possible, it would stimulate internal consumption at the expense of export trade.5. The principal, though not, of course, the only, cause of our difficulties appears to be found in the fact that in many branches, particularly of our heavy industries, our costs of production (turning upon organisation and efficiency of capital and labour) still tend to be excessive, and that these difficulties cannot be solved till these costs have been placed on a competitive level and selling methods have been improved. The development loan scheme would not help in this respect and would probably only make matters worse.6. The schemes would have a depressing effect on Government credit with no substantial set-off in increased employment.7. The schemes in the pamphlet should all be tested by the criterion whether they are likely to increase the efficiency of industry and enable it to increase output, particularly in the export trades. To a large extent the main proposals in the pamphlet are to provide not necessities but luxuries, while.the subsidiary proposals are not only uneconomic but have only an infinitesimal reaction on the unemployed.Chapter XXVI. Summary of Departmental Memoranda on Melchett-TillettReport.CHAPTER XIV (pages 69-78).Social Insurance (Government Actuary, Ministry of Health, Ministry of Labour,Department of Health, Scotland).Increased Pensions at 65 to Non-Workers.1. Even if an increased pension of say 10s. a week at 65 would have the effect desired (i.e., of inducing men to give up their work), its cost would be about  21 million a year now and  31 million ultimately, and the suggestion to save this by &quot;Consolidation &quot; is visionary. The total cost of administration of present social insurance services is  12 million a year.The grant wTould check rather than stimulate private pension schemes. Retirement of older men would not give employment to an equal number of younger men.   There would be serious reactions on existing scale of Health and Unemployment benefits.At present there are 4-1 men at the working ages to every person over 65; there will be 3 in 1960 and 2- - in 1980. It is not rig&apos;ht to burden posterity with a pledge that the elderly will be freed from all responsibility for their own maintenance.2.   Extension of Compulsory Insurance. There is no evidence of any desire for this.3.   Consolidation of several Insurance Funds, &amp;c, is undesirable, as the objects . are so different.   There is already complete co-ordination and no overlap of finance. There is no surplus of funds such as the Report suspects.   The Approved Societies would offer vigorous objection.4. Payment to Emigrants from Insurance Funds cannot be justified, and if it could the amount would be only  2 or  3 per head.
CHAPTER XV (pages 79-80).Emigration (Overseas Settlement Department and Ministry of Labour).Emigration can help unemployment only indirectly. It is not held up for lack of funds, but for causes largely originating in the Dominions. It must be left so far as possible to private enterprise.CHAPTER XVI (pages 80-82).Mining Areas (Ministry of Labour).The vieAV that unemployment in these areas is a special case has already been accepted, and transfer and training schemes are in operation to deal with itCHAPTER XVII (pages 82-85).Orders for Government and Municipal Departments (Treasury, Ministry of Health and Department of Health, Scotland).A very large preference is in fact given to home Contractors, but to lay down absolute rules would encourage rings, restrict competition, raise prices and is much to be deprecated.CHAPTER XVIII (pages 85-93). (a) Trade Facilities, and (b) Crown Colonies Developmemt.In the Treasury Memorandum the previous scheme (which expired by general consent) is described. It accelerated but did not increase work, and its main interest now is its cost to the Exchequer.The proposal to use Government credit for purpose, of rationalisation is a new departure. There is no evidence for its necessity : it would react on Government credit and would discourage unassisted effort.The simplest method of fostering Colonial development would be to extend from time to time the East African Guaranteed Loans Act with some amendment of detail to enable the loans to be more readily taken up. There may be a case also for a development fund provided out of Budget revenues to assist Colonies who cannot finance their own developments and to pay interest during the initial unproductive period of a loan.The Colonial Office think that Trade Facilities schemes are of little use as they ask too much of the Colonies. The Department propose that a Fund of  1 million should be entrusted to their discretion for guaranteeing interest for extended periods on schemes of Colonial Development. This they think would have not an immediate but an ultimate and permanent effect on improving employment at home.The Ministry of Labour consider that rationalisation of industry, though temporarily creating unemployment, is so essential for the long-range cure that any financial or legislative hindrances that are within State control should be removed.CHAPTER XIX (pages 93, 94).Export Credits (Treasury).The scheme is described. It is a distinct advantage to our export trade, but it is a form of insurance which should be handed over to private enterprise as soon as possible. Under State auspices it tends to be suspect as a subsidy and stimulates other countries to retaliation. The Board of Trade Committee nowr sitting will show whether any developments are desirable. At present the scheme extends to all markets except Russia and (for Textiles) India and the Far East.
CHAPTER XX (page 95).Development Fund (Treasury).The plan is vague but appears to involve borrowing or taxing heavily in prosperous^times, locking the money up, and spending it in times of depression. It is unworkable but is in any case irrelevant to the present time, which ex hypothesi is a time of &quot; depression.&quot;CHAPTER XXI (page 95).Eecommendation 10 (Constructional Schemes) is covered by memoranda on &quot; We can conquer Unemployment,&quot; and Recommendation 11 (Rationalisation) is mainly for industry itself.CHAPTER XXII (pages 96-97).Contact between Agriculture and Industry (Ministry of Agriculture and Boardof Agriculture, Scotland).The idea is sound, but no State action can be taken except possibly to give publicity to what has been done in Germany.  The key lies with the Farmers&apos; Union.CHAPTER XXIII (pages 97-104).School Leaving Age (Board of Education, Ministry of Labour and scottish education Department).In so far as adults were substituted for juveniles by raising the school leaving age to 15, it would involve readjustments of wages and so add enormously to costs of industry, and for this and other reasons would probably create rather than relieve unemployment. Even if compulsion were politically possible, it would be educationally unsound to raise the age until the schools are in a position to give a satisfactory education to the older children, which cannot be for some years to come. The most ardent advocates of the scheme concede five years&apos; notice, but the most inconvenient period to take the step would be between 1933 and 1936.To raise the age in 1933 would involve provision for 350,000 senior children, whose places would fall vacant after 1937.CHAPTER XXIV (pages 104-106). Monetary Policy (Treasury).The view that trade cycles are wholly or mainly due to monetary causes is contested; mere manipulation of monetary policy cannot cure industrial depression. Nor can national credit policy necessarily study the interests of industrialists to the exclusion of consumers.Credit policy is now for the Bank of England completely and reintroduction of political control is undesirable.Theoretic discussion about return to the gold standard is unprofitable as the policy was adopted with general support four years ago, and the most inveterate grumblers do not suggest turning back. The matter has really been disposed of by the Balfour Committee Final Report.That it is desirable to give effect to the Genoa resolutions is agreed, but progress depends not on our wishes but on the goodwill of other nations.o
