IS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVSRN;..l NT*SECRET. Copy No. 28f?7I5Y(29).CABINET.International Exhibition at Antwerp, 1950. Source of materials for the British Pavilion.Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.I circulate a memorandum prepared in the E^partment of Overseas Trade which raises the question of whether British or Belgian structural materials should be used in the British pavilion at the International Exhibition at Antwerp next year.As Canada is not taking part in the Exhibition, I do not think it necessary to consider the question of Canadian as against Belgian timber.    But I have grave doubts as to the desirability cf using Belgian steel,  and I do not wish to sanction the proposal without the knowledge and concurrence of my colleagues. As the question is urgent I am asking the Prime Minister to authorise those of us who can meet in the immediate future to settle this.question.P.  C-L.Board of Trade,17th May,  1929.
INTERIM AT I ON AL EXHIBITION AT ANTWERP,  1050.Source of materials for the British Pavilion.His Majesty&apos;s Government, on the advice of the Foreign Office and the Board of Trade, accepted in October 19S7 the invitation of the Belgian Government to participate In the International Colonial and Maritime Exhibition to be held under the auspices of that Government at Antwerp in 193 0, as part of the celebrations organised in honour of the centenary of the Declaration of Belgian Independence.    For this purpose the Treasury have sanctioned an expenditure of  100,000.The exhibition authorities have allotted to His Majesty&apos;s Government the best site in the exhibition grounds,  in the confidence that the buildings to be erected thereon for the accommodation of the Empire exhibits would be worthy of such a site.    The work of preparing the site has gone some distance.In connection with the erection of the British National Pavilion, the Department of Overseas Trade, after consultation with the Treasury and Office of Works and with the architect (Sir Edwin Lutyens), entered into negotiations with Humphreys Ltd., of Khightsbridge.    This firm, who have many connections and many contracts in force In Belgium and have specialized for a long period in exhibition work,  tendered an estimate for the completion of the pavilion which was comparable with prices In force for similar work, and which included alljliability for the subsequent removal of the building and restoration of the site.    The estimate was carefully considered by the Office of Works and approved by them, but has not yet been accepted.Messrs. Humphreys were told to work with the strictest regard to economy and they advised, after close calculation, that the steel should be of Belgian manufacture, mainly on account of cost.    They stated that if British steel were used the cost would be Increased by at least  5 per ton, the total
amount of steel involved being approximately 300 tons. Messrs. Humphreys at the same time pointed out that the rates for all materials likely to be used for the purpose of constructing the buildings for the exhibition were rising rapidly land they asked,  in order to safeguard themselves, for authorisation to place a contract for Belgian steel, pending acceptance of their estimate.In these cIrcumstances^  and having regard to the necessity for economy and to the fact that at all exhibitions abroad in which His Majesty&apos;s Government have participated since the formation of the special Exhibitions Division of the Board of Trade in 1908, the ordinary structural materials when available had been procured locally, Messrs. Humphreys were authorised to place the steel contract with Belgian manufacturers.It should be add?d that the question of delivery of the steel is important.    Messrs. Humphreys have a definite promise of complete delivery of the 300 tons by 15th July next.With regard to timber,  there are no stocks of British (i.e.  Canadian) &quot;timber in Belgium, and it would need special importation.    This could be done from stocks at present in this country, but Messrs. Humphreys point out that,  in comparison with&apos; Finnish, Swedish or Norwegian timber,  there would be an additional cost of at least  10 per standard.    The total quantity of timber required is approximately 300 standards.Other structural materials, e.g.,  cement, glass, asbestos sheeting and scrim,  are all obtainable in Belgium at a much lower rate than in this country and could be purchased practically on the site.If British structural materials were used throughout the building, Messrs. Humphreys Limited estimate that an additional sum of approximately  10,000 would be required.    In
view of the fact that Canada and New Zealand who had virtually undertaken to participate and share the expense have withdrawn, the additional cost would have to be borne by His Majesty&apos;s Government and it would be necessary to increase the sum to cover the cost of participation from  100,000 to  110,000.If it is decided to modify the existing arrangements, it is requested that instructions may be issued as soon as possible, in order that the contract may be signed and the work proceeded with.
