S DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT).SI Copy No .  /jjy  ________i-if-TZ. &apos; __.106.(29) CABINET.Memorandum by the Postmaster General on possible telephone concessions .I understand that following consideration by the Policy Committee the Cabinet wish to examine possible telephone concessions to the public in the following three directions -(a) an extension from 1-g- to 2 miles of the radius from the nearest exchange within which a telephone is provided at the normal rental without extra mileage charges:(b) the provision of a call office without charge and without guarantee at most rural Post Offices, whether or not they are telegraph offices:(o) the provision without charge or guarantee either by the Railway Company or the public of a telephone call office at all or most rural railway stations.(a) The extension of the free radius would be of great advantage to the rural districts and is a concession which I have for some time wished to make as soon as an assured surplus on the Telephone Account made it possible.    Its effect would be to relieve subscribers who reside 2 miles or more from the exchange of  4 per annum and those who live between Ig- and 2 miles  of  1 to  3 per annum,   and it would probably attract a considerable number of new subscribers to whom the extra, mileage charge at its present rate is a deterrent.    The immediate cost in respect of existing subscribers would be  87,000 per annum. I recommend this concession which wil] be extremely popular throughout the country.As regards  (b),   there are,  in round figures,   13,100 rural Post Offices of which about 6,800 now have a telephone call office and 6,300 have not;    of the latter all except 800 arenon-
non-telegraph offices,    Excluding some of the smallest hamlets, I presume this scheme would mean the installs^tion of a call office at some 5,500 Post Offices.    Without a detailed examination of each oase it is impossible to give any reliable figure of cost, but,  taking a rough average,  I estimate that a capital   expenditure of between  1,500,000 and  1,700,000 would be entailed.    The annual cost would be from  240,000 to  260,000 and the revenue from call fees from  18,000 to  20,000,  leaving a nett loss of some  240,000 per annum.The existing policy is to instal a call office (l) wherever there is a reasonable prospect of its paying its way or  (2) where the locality agree to guarantee the deficit, if deficit there be.    It may be assumed that the 6,800 rural call offices which have been provided under this system cover most of the villages where the cost would be moderate and the user appreciable.    There are probably some 500 to 1000 other villages where a call office would be useful, but owing to the distance from the nearest exchange would be expensive and no guarantee is forthcoming.But the majority of the villages or hamlets served by non-telegraph offices are quite Insignificant; from a representative test it is estimated that nearly 3,000 have a population under 200 and a thousand more between 200 and 300. In these places a call office would be rarely Lised,  the revenue would be negligible and the cost both of provision and maintenance high;  in many cases the exchange would be remote and none of the inhabitants in the immediate locality would be connected with the telephone.(c) As regards rural railway stations,   about  1,200 are equipped either with a direct exchange line rented by the Railway Company or by a call   office guaranteed by the Companywhere
Illwhere a deficit is expected.    On a rough estimate,  it would cost some  250,000 to provide call offices at the remaining 1,600 stations and the annual charges would be about  30,000 a year.    Even at the stations already connected, which are naturally those where the largest user was expected,  the revenue is disappointingly small 5    in fact,  at a number where the Post Office itself installed a call office experimentally in the hope of its paying its way the loss is from 40 to 50$ of the cost. The receipts from the  1,S00 not yet equipped could not be put at more than  4,000 per annum.    It must be remembered that many of these small stations are seldom used and are closed except at the times when a train is due;    the opportunities for using a telephone if it was put in would therefore be extremely restricted,,    The Railway Companies are gradually putting in telephones on the terms now offered them at stations where they think the use will, be appreciable      if the Pest Office adopt a policy of installing them free,  the result will be to transfer the inevitable loss, both on future call offices and on those already in being,  from the Company to the Telephone Account; the Companies would have to be relieved of their existing guarantees and would probably give notice to terminate the direct exchange lines,  thus converting them into call offices financed by the Post Office.I want to submit to you strongly that if the Government desire a policy of telephone development, whether for el ectoral. purposes or not,  this is the wrong way to set about it.    As you know,  I have had difficulty in the past in getting sufficient capital, for telephone extensions which have a reasonable chance of proving remunerative,  and the amount finally authorised, represents the bare minimum to maintain development at the present modest rate.If
If nore capital is available I can make use of it in directions which would ultimately yield an adequate return.* But it seems to me dangerous to embark on a policy of scattering telephones at the expense of the State  according to a general formula without regard to their cost, the use that is likely to be made of them, or the needs of the particular locality.      I quite appreciate that these schemes are not intended to be- business propositions,  cut there is a wide gap between a policy of enlarging that unr emunerative fringe which brings  In a moderate though not an adequate return and the wholesale provision of call offices which,  on an average, will result in a loss of S*ofo of their cost.    If money is available to provide a telephone costing some  300 at a small village where  it will probably be used less than once a day, I cannot help feeling there are other ways in which it might be much better spent.Alternative re commendation.A very much cheaper alternative would be for the Post Office to offer to provide new call offices where the anticipated deficit did not exceed  10 and to bear the first  10 of the loss if a guarantee  is forthcoming for the remainder I estimate from 1,000 to 1,200 new call offices would be installed on a nett cost of something under  10,000 per annum. Though not so spectacular, this concession would cover practically all districts where there is any demand or where a call office would be of any material    value;    It would exclude those where the capital expenditure is abnormally high or the user Insignificantly low, and it would provide a definite criterion on. which each case could be adjudicated.
I would further ask the  Cabinet to consider carefully whether it is wise definitely to abandon the policy of maintaining the  telephone service on a paying footing.    It is worth recalling that after the purchase of the Telegraphs by the State, the Government of the day adopted a policy of unremunerative rural telegraph offices on a large scale, which have been a contributing factor ever since to the permanent deficit on the telegraph service.    In 1927-28 the telephone surplus was  107,000;    in 1928-29 it is estimated at about  400,000  (a considerable proportion of which is derived from, the foreign telephone services) on a revenue cf  20,000,000. With the heavy charges for development in prospect it will take us all our time  to maintain a surplus at all.    The schemes referred to above would entail a capital expenditure of nearly  2,000,000 and a loss of about  350,000 per annum.    An increase  in the  cost of living or any other adverse factor would immediately produce a deficit, and at the best these unremunerative services would postpone indefinitely concessions which might be of real service both in developing the system and to those who make use  of it.Finally,  if the Government insist  on these  schemes being carried out I would ask that they be regarded as  &quot;services rendered&apos;   and that the Telephone Account should receive a credit equivalent to the annual loss entailed by them.    It is not equitable that the telephone  service, which is by way cf being run as a commercial concern,  should bear the  loss occasioned by schemes which can only be regarded as of a &quot;public welfare&quot; nature and which no telephone  company or telephone administration would willingly embark upon.    We have just as good a title to be repaid the nett annual cost of these schemes as for telephone facilities for defence  or other State purposes,  for which we receive payment at present.W.
