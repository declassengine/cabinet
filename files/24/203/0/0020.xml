D0CUM5NT JES THE  PROPERTY OF HIS BRITft.NNIC  MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)120  (29)copy NO.CAB  I N E T.REDUCTION AND LIMITATION OF ARMAlOENTS,NAVAL    LIMITATION.DRAFT OF INSTRUCTIONS TO LORD CUSHENDUN.(Circulated by the Secretary of State for ForeignmAffairs)
2i2Draft Telegram to Geneva__for Lord CuahendunSituation as explained in your various communications to me has been carefully considered by us,  but it is obviously altered a good deal by GibsonJs statement this morning of which we have just received press report.We do not yet understand why Gibson made his statement at this moment, in view of his previous assurances to you but we repeat that your reply was in exactly the right spirit,To limitation by categories covering all types of ships we of course have no objection.      (Indeed it was our own proposal). Difficulty consists solely in deciding what the categories are to be .Mere acceptance of French proposal for limited transference coupled with insistence on single category for all cruisers of 10,000 tons and under would not help usc      It would indeed revive the very controversy on which 3 Power Conference broke down.      The new and hopeful feature is in Gibson&apos;s recognition that &quot;they needed no exact balance of ships and guii3n and that his Government &quot;would be prepared to give consideration to a method of estimating equivalent naval values whjch took account of other factors than displacement of tonnage alone *&quot;When discussion is resumed we think you might again emphasise this point.      You might say that it seems to us to offer hopeful possibilities of agreement, that we shall most carefully consider it and be glad to examine its possibilities with the United States Government.      We cannot however hope to make definite suggestions on these new lines within the time allowed for the present session of the Commission and we should be glad If the Commission would give time for their examination by adjourning the dlsoussion to their next session.      Meanwhile Craigie or you might explore matter-further in same quite informal way as you have conducted previous conversations.      For instance  (a)  what have they in mind as regards allowances for calibre of guns eto3;  (b)  on what lines and to what extent would replacement be admitted  (see Washington telegrams No. 204 and 205).
Another possible solution would &quot;be some form of 1 gentleman&apos;s agreement&apos; covering the years up to 1936, between the United States of America and ourselves, which in turn might serve as the basis of an agreement between all the Naval  powers.Such an agreement might take the form of a formal statement by us that determined to keep the Kellogg Pact in letter and spirit and confident that such was also the honourable intention of the United States of America we had decided not in any circumstances to increase our declared programme of 10,000 ton cruisers before the meeting of the F-ashington Conference.The maximum of 20 which we thus set to oiffselves compares with a present declared United States programme of 23.      If the United States are willing to reduce this figure we are. prepared to reduce our 20 proportionately.It will be seen from the above that in endeavouring to secure the parity which is the accepted policy of both countries we do not seek exact mathematical equality but a broad parity which allows for special circumstances and needs of each nation, and roughly sets off the one against the other.      America declares a special need for large cruisers and we are ready to admit it as above. In return wp. should look to America to recognise our special need of cruisers of small smaller type -and inferior fighting power.     For these our programme up to 1936 will not exceed 3 a year, In replacement of an equal number of ships which have passed or are passing, age limit..-We might thus get away from the attempt at exact mathematical comparison which Gibson disavows and reach a broad but fair settlement such as we achieved by similar
methods in the case of the War claims.Y&apos;e  could invite the Japanese to make a similar statement and if we three were thus agreed could jo Invite other Naval Powers to agree to proportional limitation of their naval forces.Foreign office, S.F.1.April 23rd,  1929 .
