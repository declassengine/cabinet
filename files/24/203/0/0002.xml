PERSIA.March 18, 1929.-r.CONFIDENTIAL.Section 3.[E 1409/99/34]No. 1.Sir R. Clive to Sir Austen Chamberlain.-(Received March 18.)(No. 107.) Sir,Tehran, February 26, 1929.I HAVE the honour to report that M. Loganovsky, counsellor of the Soviet Embassy here, recently made a tour in South Persia, in the course of which he visited Isfahan and Shiraz.   The Russian military attache accompanied him.2. While at Isfahan, M. Loganovsky appears to have invited some forty of tbe principal merchants to meet him, only fourteen of whom, however, accepted his invitation, the others having been discouraged by the Governor from going to the Russian consulate-general. His principal object in interviewing these people seems to have been to ascertain the effect in Persia of the recent events in Afghanistan, and he was, I understand, reluctant to believe that they had had little or no effect, as all appear to have assured him. He then proceeded to Shiraz, where the manager of the Russo-Persian Bank invited several merchants to accord him an &quot; istiqbal.&quot;3. Unfortunately for the success of this plan, the Chief of Police heard of it, and as the merchants, and a local Deputy who is said to be in debt to the Russo-Persian Bank, were on their way to the rendezvous, had them stopped, and turned back, and personally upbraided them with some vehemence. Certain bill-brokers had, however, proceeded in cars by some other route. These the commandant had followed and brought to the police station, where they were detained for three days.4. M. Loganovsky called upon the Governor next day and interceded for those who had been imprisoned, who were, however, not released until M. Loganovsky had departed. He is also said to have complained on his return to Tehran of the attitude adopted by the officials.5. Mr. Chick reports that the Governor of Shiraz regards the affair as most amusing, and that a telegram from the Central Government has approved the action taken.6. I am convinced that it is at present the settled policy of the Shah and the Minister of Court not to tolerate Russian propaganda in any form. This morning I received a long visit from the newly-appointed Governor of Resht, Mirza Reza Khan Afshar, who told me that he had received precise instructions from Taimourtache to report at once to Tehran any evidence of undesirable Soviet activities and to take all necessary steps to stop Communist propaganda.A copy of this despatch is being sent to the Government of India.I have, &amp;c.R. H. CLIVE.[744 s-3]
