Printed for the Cabinet.   March 1929.SECRET.CP. 103 (29).CABINET,POLITICAL SITUATION IN IRAQ.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.ON the 5th December, 1927, Mr. Ormsby-Gore, in my absence, submitted for the approval of the Cabinet the draft of a new treaty with Iraq to replace the treaties of 1922 and 1926. In his covering memorandum (CP. 304 (27)) he explained that it was not intended to proceed to ratification of the new treaty until the revision of the Military and Financial Agreements of 1924 had been completed. At their meeting of the 7th December the Cabinet approved the draft treaty submitted to them, which was accordingly signed on the 14th December.2. Formal negotiations for the revision of the Military and Financial Agree-ments were opened with the Iraq Government in the spring of last year and continued for some nine months. At an early stage Sir H. Dobbs, who conducted the negotiations on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government, encountered serious opposition. The more vocal elements in Iraq had professed themselves greatly disappointed with the 1927 treaty, and the Cabinet of Abdul Muhsin were determined in the case of the new Agreements to secure a revision which could be represented as a marked advance towards complete independence and emancipation from British-control.3. In framing the revised Agreements every consideration had been paid to Iraqi sensibilities, and throughout the negotiations every endeavour was made to render them more palatable to local sentiment by concessions of wording ; but certain principles were involved upon which, so long as the actual responsibility for the defence of Iraq rested upon Great Britain, no accommodation was felt to be possible, and it was against these principles that Iraqi opposition was principally directed..4. At the end of October I authorised the High Commissioner to make a very stiff communication to King Faisal and his Ministers in the hope that, once having realised that the limits of concession had been reached, they would bow to the inevitable and would conclude new Agreements in terms which we could accept. This action, which I reported to the Cabinet at the time (CP. 337 (28)), unfortunately had but little effect. The Iraq Government professed to believe that nothing less than the concessions which they had demanded would satisfy Iraqi public opinion, and that, even if they were themselves to sign agreements in the terms suggested by His Majesty&apos;s Government, these would inevitably be rejected by the Iraqi Parliament.5. The negotiations dragged on until January last, when, on learning that His Majesty&apos;s Government were not prepared to make any further concessions, Abdul Muhsin handed in the resignation of his Cabinet to King Faisal. He subsequently consented, in deference to King Faisals request and in order not unduly to embarrass Sir Gilbert Clayton, the new High Commissioner, whose arrival was imminent, to remain temporarily in office. His Cabinet have, however, chosen to regard their position as that of caretakers only and themselves as incapable of taking any important decision, with the result that the transaction of public business is very largely at a standstill.6.   The present Cabinet represent moderate opinion in Iraq as opposed to the extreme nationalism which marks the opposition parties, and the High Commissioner [19058] copy No..28
ANNEX.Paraphrase Telegram from the Acting High Commissioner for Iraq to the Secretaryof State for the Colonies.Dated 14th March, 1929.No. 110 of 14th March.My telegram No. 105 of 9th March. I have had further conversations with King and Prime Minister, which have confirmed my first impressions.The Prime Minister and King Feisal both fully recognise necessity of forming a stable Ministry, but say that, unless a way can be found out of the present dilemma, it is impossible to do so.They believe that the immediate questions at issue could be laid aside and a strong Ministry formed if certain assurances were given which would tend to allay the suspicions which undoubtedly exist as to the genuineness of His Majesty&apos;s Governments declarations of policy in regard to Iraq.has reported that if Abdul Muhsin decides to make his resignation effective, no alternative Ministry could be prevailed upon to take office so long as His Majesty&apos;s Government maintain their present attitude towards the revision of the Military and Financial Agreements. In such a contingency it might in the last resort be necessary to administer the country directly through the medium of the British advisers to the various Iraqi Ministries. This would mean the temporary suspension of the Constitution and of representative institutions. The situation would doubtless be exploited by propaganda and political agitation, and conditions might arise in which the British garrison in Iraq would find itself in a position of some difficulty and embarrassment.7. Apart from this consideration, however, such an expedient would imply a confession of failure on the part of His Majesty&apos;s Government. Whether or not. a constitutional government and parliamentary institutions are really suited to Iraq, may be open to question; but there is no question that we have publicly pinned&apos; our faith to the experiment, and in our various reports to the League we have perhaps rather plumed ourselves upon its success. It would be humiliating if we now had to recant and to revert to the system of direct administration which we abandoned as unsuitable eight years ago. . Our confession of failure would be all the worse if accompanied by disturbances in Iraq and military action by the British garrison.8. It seemed essential therefore that every effort should be made to produce some modus vivendi which would enable Abdul Muhsin to remain in office or some alternative Ministry to be appointed ; and to this end Sir Gilbert Clayton, immediately upon his arrival in Iraq, opened conversations with the Iraq Government. I now circulate for the information of my colleagues two telegrams which have been received from Sir Gilbert Clayton indicating the conditions upon which King Faisal believes it possible that a new Ministry could be formed. As will be seen those conditions involve the abandonment of the treaty of 1927 and the proposed new Military and Financial Agreements, and in their place an extension of the currency of the Agree-ments of 1924. King Faisal believes that an Iraqi Cabinet could be found who would accept this arrangement in return for certain formal assurances on the part of His Majesty&apos;s Government. The most important concerns the entry of Iraq into the League of Nations in 1932; its effect would be to retain in force Article 8 of the 1927 Treaty, which contained a conditional undertaking by His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment to support the candidature of Iraq for admission to the League in 1932. After consultation with all interested Departments, I sent to the High Commissioner the telegram of the 25th March, a copy of which is annexed. I now report my action for the approval of my colleagues. I will keep the Cabinet informed of further developments.L. S. A.Colonial Office, March 28, 1929.
I made no suggestions, and took the line that it was for them to form a Ministry, but I told the King that if proposals were put forward I would gladly consider whether they could be submitted to His Majesty&apos;s Government.King has now made the following proposals to me verbally, which he and the Prime Minister consider would enable a Ministry to take office if accepted by His Majesty&apos;s Government : First. Drop the 1927 Treaty and Agreements altogether and carry on under the existing Treaty and Agreements, prolonging the periods prescribed in Article 1 of the Military Agreement and Article 3 of the Financial Agreement to a date to be agreed upon in order to regularise the position of His Majesty&apos;s forces in Iraq.Second. His Majesty&apos;s Government to inform League of Nations at the first opportunity that they propose to recommend the admission of Iraq to the League on a specified date. The question will thus be noted as an item on the agenda for a specified session of the League of Nations.Third. Some communication which will dispel the impression produced by His Majesty&apos;s Government&apos;s statement in regard to a conscription law for Iraq to be made to the Iraq Government. Although His Majesty&apos;s Government have left this question to the Iraq Government to decide, the condition imposed in respect to employ-ment of His Majesty&apos;s forces has produced the impression that His Majesty&apos;s Government are against the measure, and that they do not really wish to see Iraq with an efficient Army. It is the King&apos;s idea that the Bill might be passed through Parliament at an early date, but its operation withheld until such time as it appeared feasible to enforce it without disturbance. He anticipated withholding enforcement for about two years.Fourth. His Majesty&apos;s Government to promise to give to British capital all possible encouragement to finance enterprises in Iraq.Fifth. The Iraq Government to withdraw their rejection of His Majesty&apos;s Governments proposals in regard to transfer of railways on the understanding that negotiations will be reopened as soon as possible without prejudice to either party.King informed me in conclusion that he felt confident of securing a Ministry which would command adequate support in Parliament if the above proposals were accepted. Otherwise, no course was open but that of government by force, the onus of which would fall on His Majesty&apos;s Representative; in this event, a Ministry which was not responsible would receive no support in the Chamber, and government, without Parliament would soon become inevitable.My comments on above proposals are being submitted in a subsequent telegram..Paraphrase Telegram from the Acting High Commissioner for Iraq to the Secretary of State for the Colonies.Dated 14th March, 1929.No. Ill of the 14th March.My telegram No. 110 of 14th March.The following are comments on the proposals made to me by King Feisal: First. Discussion of the revised treaties and agreements was initiated at the instance of the Iraq Government, and His Majesty5s Government would, I presume, lose nothing by continuing the old ones. The new Treaty certainly provides for con-tinuance beyond the date of the entry of Iraq into the League of Nations, but revision is provided for, and, in any case, it seems certain that the change of conditions which would then ensue would render extensive revision necessary. I cannot see that His Majesty&apos;s Government by accepting this proposal stand to lose much; indeed, they might gain by keeping a freer hand for dealing with a future which it is difficult to foresee accurately.Second. Proposal is based on desire to obtain a more binding undertaking in regard to Iraq&apos;s entry into the League of Nations. There is widespread suspicion of the real intentions of His Majesty&apos;s Government in this matter, and even the moderate men are inclined to believe that His Majesty&apos;s Government will find some excuse for not recommending Iraq for admission when 1932 draws near. Article 8 of the 1927 Treaty does bind His Majesty&apos;s Government to recommend Iraq for admission to the League in 1932, and they would have to give convincing reasons for not doing so.   The proviso is, however, vaguely worded, and a more definite[19058] &apos; b 2
assurance would, I believe, have a great effect in restoring atmosphere of confidence which is essential if a satisfactory settlement is to be reached on the many questions outstanding. At the same time the formula suggested by Faisal is too far-reaching. It might be held to bind His Majesty&apos;s Government not only to bring question officially before the League, but also to recommend admission on the specified date, whatever new factors may have arisen in the meantime.I suggest, therefore, that the Iraq Government might be informed that they may apply for admission to the League of Nations as soon as they like and that His Majesty&apos;s Government will forward their application to the League, saying that, although they cannot, in view of various important internal and external questions which are still under settlement, recommend immediate admission, they wish application placed on the Agenda of the League for consideration in 1932, by which time Iraq should be ready for admission.King Faisal evidently hopes for an earlier date, but I recommend holding to 1932. It is convenient to retain principle of revision after periods of four years; moreover, I do not consider the ground can be cleared before that date.Third. I do not recommend withdrawal of the proviso contained in His Majesty&apos;s Governments statement in regard to conscription. Impression that His Majesty&apos;s Government is opposed to conscription may have been produced by it, but to withdraw it would have the opposite effect. However, I suggest that His Majesty&apos;s Government might inform Iraq. Government that they fully sympathise with their desire to create efficient army within the compass of their financial resources and will always do everything possible to help them in their task of providing an adequate and efficient instrument of national defence of the country.Fourth. This request is inspired by the feeling that His Majesty&apos;s Government may not, perhaps, desire to see too great an economic and commercial development in (?) principle. The difficulties which have arisen in finding a really suitable and influential Financial Adviser, which Iraq urgently needs, have lent colour to this idea in certain quarters.Fifth. I see no objection to this proposal. It may, indeed, lead to satisfactory settlement of railway question.To sum up, I believe that, apart from the specific questions at issue in regard to the agreements, the root of the difficulty lies in suspicion and lack of confidence. Until these are counteracted, we must expect increasing friction and a steady deterioration in the situation which may lead to direct British administration with its attendant embarrassments. I hope, therefore, that King FeisaFs proposals may receive very sympathetic consideration and be met in as generous a measure as possible, conditional, of course, on his actually forming a Ministry.I should like to be in a position to give Faisal a reply as soon as possible after his return to Baghdad from the country, where he has gone for three days.Paraphrase Telegram from the Secretary of State for the Colonies to the ActingHigh Commissioner for Jraq.Dated 25th March, 1929.No. 108. Your telegrams Nos. 110 and 111 of 14th March. Proposals made by King Feisal have been sympathetically considered, and His Majesty&apos;s Government are prepared, in order to assist him to form a Ministry, to meet him to the extent indicated below.   I will deal with his proposals seriatim.First. His Majesty&apos;s Government are prepared to agree to dropping of 1927 Treaty and proposed new agreements provided that agreements at present in force are extended in manner proposed until i932.Second. Actual proposal made by the King is impracticable as it is not in accord with League of Nations practice or procedure. League Council would be extremely unlikely to accept notice of question to be considered three years hence when existing circumstances might have changed completely. Alternative suggestion which has been made by you is open to similar objection. It might also lead to submission by Government of Iraq of prejnature and useless applications for membership which, besides embarrassing His Majesty&apos;s Government, would create political unrest and agitation in Iraq. His Majesty&apos;s Government are, however, prepared to inform League Council at earliest opportunity when notifying that body that it is not proposed to proceed with 1927 Treaty, that it is His Majesty&apos;s
.Governments intention, unless in the meantime any serious check in the political or economic progress of the country has occurred, to recommend to the Council at their June session in 1932, by which time various important internal and external questions which are still under settlement should have been disposed of, that Iraq should be admitted to membership of the League forthwith.Third. His Majesty&apos;s Government agree that there can be no question of withdrawing proviso in regard to conscription, and consider it important that Iraqis should be left in no doubt on this point. For this purpose, it is desirable that any further statement on the subject, such as you suggest, should contain a reaffirmation of the principle of non-intervention by the British garrison. Assurance which you suggest, if merely accompanied by restatement of proviso, would seem unlikely to satisfy Iraq Government. You may therefore inform them as follows. Begins:The decision by His Majesty&apos;s Government, to which they feel bound to adhere, that in no circumstances must&quot; British forces to employed to assist in the enforcement of conscription in Iraq, was inspired by no lack of sympathy with the wholly laudable desi re of the Iraq Government to create an efficient army within the compass of their financial resources. On the contrary, His Majesty&apos;s Government fully sympathise with this aspiration, and will do their utmost to assist the Iraq Government in their task of providing an adequate and efficient instrument of national defence. Nor should it be inferred from that decision that His Majesty&apos;s Government have any objection in principle to the introduction of compulsory service in Iraq if it can be shown to be acceptable to the country generally, as to which His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment feel considerable doubt. In their opinion, however, conscription is a measure which, in the absence of any great national emergency, should be adopted only with the general consent of the people; that is to say, only when the people as a whole are satisfied as to its necessity. To impose such a measure by force upon an unwilling country would in any case be objectionable, but to do so with the assistance of alien troops would be wholly repugnant to all British conceptions of justice and good government.   Ends.Fourth. The King&apos;s proposal is evidently based upon misunderstanding of relations between His Majesty&apos;s Government and the City of London. It is open to Iraq, as to any other foreign country, to invite British investors to lend capital for the financing of local enterprises. Extent to which their invitation is likely to meet with success will depend on attractiveness of their offer in competition with other borrowers and in relation to risk involved. It should be borne in mind by Iraq Government that investors, in estimating the risk of investment in a foreign country, look not only to the prospects of the particular enterprise and the ability of its management, but also to the credit and security of the national Government and the extent to which the management of the enterprise can claim to be free from political interference. His Majesty&apos;s Government, beyond furnishing accurate information regarding local conditions if asked to do so, are not in a position to influence the market in its decision. You should explain to the King accordingly, but you may assure him that His Majesty&apos;s Government have no intention whatever of placing obstacles in the way of British capital desiring to interest itself in Iraq. On the contrary, they would welcome the investment of British capital in Iraq so long as the security offered remains satisfactory.Fifth. Precise meaning of this proposal is not clear. It is assumed by His Majesty&apos;s Government that intention is that period of four years mentioned in first and second paragraphs of Article 8 of Financial Agreement should be extended in same manner as is proposed in the case of Article 1 of Military and Article 3 of Financial Agreement, and that Government of Iraq should continue to be responsible for management and administration of railways, while ownership is retained by His Majesty&apos;s Government, but that negotiations for final disposal of railways, either by transfer to Iraq Government or otherwise, should be resumed at once. If this assumption is correct, His Majesty&apos;s Government would be prepared to agree, but must stipulate that Iraq Government for their part will grant forthwith satisfactory contracts to the Railway officials. Having regard, to the delay which has already occurred and to the further delay which continued negotiations might involve, His Majesty&apos;s Government cannot agree to present unsatisfactory position of Railway officials being allowed to continue, and must regard grant of satisfactory contracts as sine qua non.
Treasury Chambers, Whitehall, S.W., My dear Prime Minister, April 2, 1929.The notes which, by your instructions, have been prepared by the Departments concerned on the subject-matter of the pamphlet &quot;We can conquer Unemployment &quot; and of the Melchett-Tillett &quot; Report on Unemployment &quot; are now available for your consideration. As was your wish, these notes represent the views and experience of the various officials who would have the actual business of giving effect to the proposals contained in the two documents ; no sort of pressure, one way or another, has of course been put upon these gentlemen, and where their views differ there has been no attempt to slur or&quot; minimise such differences.There is one point that I should like particularly to emphasise in connection with the pamphlet &quot; We can conquer Unemployment,&quot; and that is that the time-table within which the programme it outlines is to effect its object necessitates the substitution of autocracy for Parlia-mentary Government. The War-time D.O.R.A. would have to be restored at once; and the Government of the day would have to be entrusted by Parliament with absolute powers in a variety of matters. There must be powers for immediate compulsory acquisition and occupation of land: there must be power to override Local Authorities: there must be such measures of industrial conscription as the enforced movement and engagement of some types of labour to the exclusion of other types desiring to volunteer; and, as a likely corollary of industrial conscription, control of the profits of contractors and others benefiting directly or indirectly from the artificial diversion of the channels of normal trade.Even if a Mussolini regime could be proved to be desirable for the &quot; war &quot; against unemployment, speaking as an ordinary British citizen 1 do not believe for one moment that the country would stand it. The full rigour of D.O.R.A. was tolerated during the war because 100 per cent, of the population felt themselves to be in urgent danger of something infinitely worse; to-day 90 per cent, of the population have more material happiness and amenity than in all our previous history, and sad though the plight of the other 10 per cent, is realised to be by those of us who know, the 90 per cent, would never even on that account acquiesce in full peace-time in a bureaucracy invested with such wide and arbitrary powers.Yours sincerely,N. P. WARREN FISHER.The Right Hon. Stanley Baldwin, M.P.[ 19066 a]
