10 9LooCopy No.Cabinet Agricultural Policy/-.ilote by the Minister of Agriculture &amp; Fisheries.I circulate herewith, for the approval of the Cabinet, the report of the Agricultural Sub-Committee of the Policy Committee containing recommendations for our agricultural policy for the General Election.In addition to these suggestions I recommend that we should also announce that the Government grants to Shire Hors Societies will be increased by 25%.     These grants at present amount to about  8,000 per annum, so that the cost of the. proposal would only be  2,000 per annuir,.    The number of agricultural horses in recent years has shown a marked decline, and further Government assistance to the Societies is desirable and would be very popular with farmers.et.112(2 9).try of Agriculture Sc Fisheries. 13th April, 1929.
POLICY   CQMJalTTEB./* &apos; &apos; L     I.IJAGRICULTURAL SuB-COi^ilTIEE, RiPORT.1, In our Report presented in February 1928 we madethe following recommendations:-.(1) That the rating of agricultural land shouldbe abolished. (2 ) That the grants from the Road Fund for themaintenance and improvement of roads In rural areas should be increased. (3) That there should be some alleviation of thepresent burden of death duties on agriculturalestates.(4) That the Government Departments concerned should consider whether it is expedient to Institute further enquiry into the present position of Covent Garden uarket. 2. Recommendations (1) and (2) have been carried out,3. In view, however, of the insistent demands whichare being made that some further action should be taken by. the Government to relieve agricultural depression we have re-examined the subject.. 4. Serious agricultural depression, like the depressionin industry,  is not general: It is confined to certain black spots which cover an area comprising about one-sixth of England and \;ales, chiefly in the Eastern and Southern counties.     Conditions are worst in East Anglia and on the heavy lands of Essex.     Taking the country as a whole unemployment in agriculture exists only in a small degree and is probably for the most-t part of a temporary nature.It
It is most important that the problem should be seen in its right perspective.     The many industries that are commonly grouped together under the term &quot;agriculture&quot; are not all depressed.     Hot even the majority of them are depressed.     Even arable land as a whole is not suffering from severe depression, but only some particular types of arable land. dies. 4. The only way in which farmers in these seriouslydepressed areas could he given help by the Government which will remove their difficulties is by a Government subsidy.      In the V/hite Paper on Agricultural Policy published in February, 1925, the Government definitely declared against a policy of either protection or subsidies, and consequently any policy of subsidies announced on the eve of a General Election could only be justified on the ground that it was designed to relieve the existing localised depression.     A subsidy on wheat growing might be justified on that ground;the areas which are most seriously depressed are generally those areas in which the bulk cf our wheat is grown. 5. It is doubtful, however, whether a temporary subsidy on wheat would be in the best interests of agriculture. Agriculture, like other industries, has to adapt itself to changing conditions and any temporary subsidy from the Government would merely postpone changes which are now being dictated by economic forces.      From the financial point, of view a subsidy would be expensive in relation  -to the result on the production of national wealth; a subsidy guaranteeing the price of wheat at 55s. a quarter would cost-, at least  3?S00..0UG per annum, and might even rise to over 2,9,joj,GuCJ.     From the point of view of the Election a subsidy on wheat would very probably lose more votes than it would gain.      It would certainly please the farmers
3.farmers of East Anglla, but it would inevitably raise a cry from farmers In other parts of the country that they were being left out in the cold.     -Scotland, for example, Would certainly.demand a subsidy on oats. 6. We consider, therefore, that any form of subsidy on arable cultivation is inadvisable and cannot be recommended.7. The economic position of the farmer can,   however,be improved to some extent, not only in the depressed areas, but all over the country by Government assistance aimed at reducing the farmers&apos; costs of production or improving his net receipts or both.     The Government have already advanced considerable sums of money for the reduction of farmers&apos; costs of production by the de-rating of agricultural land and buildings, by the granting of a 10 per cent freight reduction on certain agricultural traffics and by increased grants from the Road Fund for rural roads. 8. There are several, directions, apart from protectionor subsidies  (which are impracticable) In which the Government can do something to assist the farrier to improve his net receipts.     They can be grouped under the two healing of production and marketing. fic   9,, Any Improvement In the technique of production is obviously beneficial.     We attach great importance, therefore, to the work of agricultural research.     There Is probably no form of Government grants to agriculture in which money could be better spent.     We have been informed by the Secretary of State for Scotland that owing to lack of funds he Is sometimes unable to pay adequate salaries to research workers and that in consequence such workers have been attracted overseas by the offer of higher salaries.
la y.e,\7e therefore recommend that the government should grant an additional sun, say , 501000 per anrruca/o^f,i^lt^al rresearch in Great Britain,,11.another means of Improving production is by the drainage of agricultural land.     a  rood deal of useful work has been done throughout Great Britain, with, the assistance of Government grants.      In England and V-ales it is difficult to estimate what amount of money might be spent on a further programme of land drainage schemes similar to those which have been in operation during the past few years, save in the case of the River Ouse, which is exceptional and which is at present the subject of correspondence between the ministry of Agriculture and. the Treasury. The difficulty with regard to future work generally is that agriculturists are already overburdened with drainage rates required to pay merely for maintenance work, and the possibility of embarking on further schemes depends almost entirely on the amount of Government assistance that is offered.      It may be assumed that a contribution from the 3r,ate of at least 75 per cent of the cost would be tho lowest that would be likely to attract any measure of new work, on the assumption that work costing hundreds of thousands of pounds per annum as compared with tens of thousands of pounds per armurn should be  put in hand.12, A survey is, however, now being conducted witha view to the drafting of a bill to carry out the recommendations of the Royal Commission on -and -Drainage,   and we are of opinion that any available Government funds for England and   ales could mostus e fully
usefully be given in this direction.     Y/e do not recommend any definite sum of money as.there are at^, present no figures on which an estimate could he based.     In any case we think the mention of any definite sum of money in our Election programme would be Inadvisable as it would inevitably look meagre as compared with the. figures mentioned in the Liberal Pamphlet &quot;WE CJI CONQUER UNEMPLOYMENT&quot; . 13. We therefore recommend that the Governmentshould announce their intention to pass legislation in the next Parliament on jthe lines recommended by the Royal Commission on Land Drainage in Sa.;dand and Wales., and that assistance from.State funds will be forthcoming,  as suggested by the Roval Commission to facilitate the carrying out of the major works which will become the responsibilitTf of the new Catchment Area authorities which will b e set up.14. In Scotland owing to different conditionsGovernment assistance can more usefully be used for field drainage.      It is estimated that a sum of  40,jgj to  50,000 per annum for five years might usefully be provided. IS. We accordingly recqmr-end that theGovernment should announce that in^atldjtion to the provision forr land drainage in England and   ales, further Government assistance will be given for land drainage in Scotland,
6.16. a further means of improving production is by theliming of agricultural land.     On a considerable part of the land under cultivation in this country regular applications of lime are essential if the full productive capacity of the soil Is to be maintained, and there are few agricultural questions on whicn there is such general agreement as on the need for liming.      During the last ,3 0 or 4o years liming has been neglected.     A short-sighted policy of economy in the first place    ignorance, forgetfulness, reluctance on the part of tenant farmers to spend money on an operation which does not produce results for several years, and to so e extent in recent years high cost of fuel, transport and labour are all factors which have played a part in starving the land of lime.     The harmful effects which follow from neglect become apparent only by small degrees and after several years.     x&apos;he time&apos;has now come, however, when the evil can only be remedied by considerable dressings involving a greater outlay than the farmer is usually prepared to face.      In the vast majority of cases adequate dressings will not be applied without some form of Government assistance.17. There is a good deal to be said on the grounds of national policy In favour of assistance to liming. The farmer is encouraged to carry out operations which are in themselves sound and desirable, and the itate receives a definite return for its expenditure in increased fertility to the land and in greater production of wealth.     There is no doubt that from the agricultural point of view the policy is sound.      From a political point of view, however, the Committee were not fully unanimous as to its desirability.      One view was
was that liming would prove a useful item in a list of small measures of assistance.     The opposite view was that farmers in the depressed areas would say &quot;We ask you for help to prevent us from becoming bankrupt and you-offer us something only on condition that we spend more money, the benefit of which we shall . not reap for years&quot;.     Moreover the proposal is a definite subsidy and farmers might say &quot;If you are orepared to offer us a subsidy offer a little more, then give us a subsidy on our wheat&apos;&apos;&apos; .      The fact that while the political advantages of the proposal are doubtful it is in principle contrary to our general policy not to grant subsidies should be borne in mind, 18c After full consideration of the subject,however, we are generally of opinion that this proposal should be included in our agricultural policy, but only if it forms one of a number of other measures for the relief of agriculture.     We recognise that it offers very little immediate advantage to farmers, and that offered by itself it would be received -with derision. 19. We therefore recommend that the Governmentshould offer to pay on production of the necessary receipts one half of the cost  (delivered at the farm) of lime applied to arable land., 20. Particulars of the scheme proposed are set outin the Appendix.It is difficult to estimate what the cost bo the State would be, but it is unlikely that it would amount to more than  5,000,000 spread over five years, ting.     21. Turning now to an improvement in the farmersreceipts, we consider that a prominent feature of the Government &quot;s agricultural programme should be the encouragement of improved marketing methods,  includingco-operative
r     -   141e.co-operative Marketing.     The i &quot;inistry of Agriculture has already done a great deal of useful work in marketing refona.     This work is very difficult, and while always taking the initiative, the ministry has sought at each stage in the advance to secure the agreement of both pro5.ucers and distributors. The great changes involved can of necessity only he carried out slowly, and it would be fatal to try to force the pace.     We therefore suggest that the work should proceed on present lines.     There is, however, one feature of the !&apos;inistryfs marketing work which is somewhat unsatisfactory.     The work is at present dependent on a grant of  40,000 a year for five years from the Empire Marketing Board.     About., three years of that time has elapsed, and the fact that the position will have to be reviewed by the Empire J:arketing Board in two years&apos; time inevitably creates some uncertainty.     The British farmer, although he has received a fair share of attention from the Empire Marketing Board, is inclined to ask why in the matter of grants of money from the Exchequer his needs should he considered not on their. . own merits, hut only as part of a much largerexpenditure designed for the benefit of the overseas Empire.22. We therefore reoommend that &quot;marketingreform should occupy a prominent position in the government&apos;s agricultural policy, and that an announcement should be made that the work which has been undertaken as an experiment has already proved so fruitful that the Government has decided that it should
o.farm a permanent feature of their agricultural pfilioyy and, that accordingly the work will in future be fina.nced directly^by^.vcted monies instead of by a grant from the Ei.ipi.re Marketing Board. We recormend that a sum of  ^0,COG nej? annum be allocated to the j inistry of Agriculture by the Treasury for this purpose.     Apart from this change -H1       financing of the ministry sf Agriculture&apos;s marketing activities, we do not consider that any . change should be made in the Empire Farketing Board&apos;si activities with, regard to home produce.2J.      A scheme is already in existence under which grants are made by the Kinistry of Agriculture to co-operative societies for the purpose of marketing agricultural produce.     This assistance takes the foni of a loan limited to a maximum of  10,000 which has to be repaid over a period of years by instalments, including interest and sinking fund;   the loan usually being free of interest for the first two years.   These conditions are somewhat onerous, and it would be useful if the conditions could, be relaxed somewhat.2ij.. We therefore recommend that the conditions under which loans to cc -operat ive societies for the marketing of agricultural produce should be relaxed by raising the existing limit of  10,000 for any; one loan and by the extension, of the interest-free perJo&amp; fvon 2. Jo0 5 years and of the peric^d over which the, loans should be repaid.Telephones
At a large number of rural railway stations telephone call offices hare not yet been provided,, and farmers in these areas find it impossible to ascertain from the railway station by telephone whether consignments of their requirements have arrived at the station, or whether empty trucks are available for their produce.     The provision of telephones at all rural railway stations would therefore be of considerable assistance to farmers in this respect.     We understand that the cost of providing call offices at all rural railway stations where they are not already installed would involve annual charges of about  ^OjOOO. The estimated receipts are about  4,000 per annuia, so that the net annual cost would be  26,000-We recommend that telephony call offices should be provided at all rural railway stations.In order further to increase the demand for hone produce we have considered whether it would be practicable to supply hone-killed beef to H.T.. Forces instead of frozen.     The supply of fresh neat all the year round would involve considerably increased expense.     To limit the supply of fresh neat to the six months October to march inclusive, when prices are usually at their lowest would, however, involve an extra cost of only  200,000 per annum, assuming that beef was supplied as atpresent
r        144present cn six days of the week.     (Kutton is supplied on one day a week).     This proposal would benefit both the grazing and arable areas.The substitution of fresh meat during this period would tend to steady markets and would mitigatesomewhat the heavy fall in prices which normallyoccurs in the autumn.     The proposal would &quot;bevery popular amongst the farming community andfrom the political point of view it would &quot;be an attractive item in our Election programme.We therefore recor-mend that the Govei^msntshould announce their intention to supply with.M. Forces home-killed meat instead of frozenon six days a week during the period October to march inclusive.We have also examined the question whether itwould be possible to supply bread to H.H. Forcesbaked from flour containing a fixed percentage erfhome-grr?wn wheat.    We consider that it would be practicable to stipulate in Government contractsthat during the period of six months after harvestflour supplied for the baking of bread for H.I..Forces should contain 25 per cent of flour milledfrom home-grown wheat.     A higher percentage or a longer period of the year would present difficulties.It is impossible to say what increase, if any, inthe cost of tbo bread would be involved in out?proposal, but the amount should ba inconsiderable.There would be some difficulty in determining whetherthe stipulated percentage was adhered to.;   nevertheless we-

appendix.Following are particulars of the scheme for encouraging the liming; of arable land as recommended in paragraph 19 of our report;-1. It is suggested that the State should offer to pay,on production of the necessary receipts, a proportion of the cost (delivered at the farm) of lime applied to arable land.2. In order to discourage unnecessary and wasteful expendi-ture it is essential that the farmer should bear a reasonable part of the cost.    On the other hand, if the scheme is to achieve its object the terms must be sufficiently attractive to induce farmers to take advantage of it.     There is a great deal to be said from these points of view for an equal division of the cost between the farmer and the State.3. It would not be practicable to differentiate betweenthe varieties of &quot;lime&quot;.    The farmer should be left free to apply burnt llxne., chalk or limestone, ground or in the lump, according to the needs of the soil and the sources available.4. The scheme should be accompanied by an active education-al campaign on the part of the Ministry and the county education staffs.      It is to be expected that there would be a considerable amount of Inertia to be overcome and the response to the scheme might be small at first and would probably increase as the benefits became apparent - say, after .two years.    For this reason time would be required for the   achievement -of the. main object, viz. the general improvement of the soli of the country, and it would be desirable to extend the scheme over a period of, say, five years.5, It is very difficult to estimate what would be thedemand and the cost to the Exchequer.    Present prices average abo\;t 35/0d. a ton for lump lime, f.0.r. and 25/0d. a ton for ground chalk or ground limestone f.o.r.   An ameliorating dressing which would start up the permanent improvement of the soil would cost the  aa^tter  4 to  5 per acre apart from carriage, which might be&apos; 1 : 1.
Appendix10/Od. a ton.   His total Pill (apart from cost of labour which would not be eligible for assistance) would be, say,  6 to  7 per acre.     Assuming that 10$ of the arable area, i,e. 1,000,0jJ acres, roughly, for England and Wales, and 3 00,000 acres  or Scotland, were thus lim^,..   the cost to the State would be about  4 million to  5 million spread over five years. The figure taken for England and Wales^ via,, 1,000,000 acres, corresponds approximately with the area estimated to require liming in 1918, assuming (as is reasonable) a dressing of 3 to 4 tons per acre.      It should be remembered, in considering the response which is likely to be made to an offer of this nature,, that the farmer himself would have to pay half the bill, so that one is justified in assuming that lime would be applied only where it was really needed, and further that not all farmers whose land needed lime would, be able or willing to take advantage of the scheme.6:. The que stion of supply and price are of course of greatimportance.     Control of prices is objectionable, and in any event impracticable, but, clearly, steps would have to be taken to ensure that the State contribution was not, even in part, absorbed by the producers of lime.7. There should be no difficulty with regard to supply, whichis abundant.   &apos;/ith regard to price, it is understood that a considerable proportion of the lime trade - sufficient to enable the price to be controlled - is in the hands of Imperial Chemical Industries, Ltd..     It is suggested that if the scheme at present under examination were approved, in principle, consultation should take place with that firm and, if possible, some agreement arrived at, before any public announcement were made.     Having regard to the policy of Imperial Chemical Industries, Ltd., and its associated firm, Kitram Ltd.,in regard to fertilisers in general, it is not contemplated that there would be any serious difficulty in securing an undertaking that the price of lime would not be raised during the currency of the Government; scheme,      I.C.-I. would no doubt readily appreciate the advantages,  from their point of view of a scheme which would
-    148Appendixenable farmers t.o obtain greater- value from Artificial Manures and increase the productivity of the land as. a whole.    It is not.inconceivable that they might even consider it worth while to^assist in furthering the objects of the scheme by reducing the price of lime.8. It is hoped that it would be possible in this wayto regulate the price for the country as a whole, but it would still be possible to prevent exploitation by prescribing maximum f.o.r. prices for, say, each county.    This, however, is undesirable If it can be avoided, as prices would tend at once to settle at the maximum point.9. Legislation would probably be necessary to deal withcertain difficulties, but it would be of a simple character. The Ministry would have to be satisfied before paying the State contribution (i) that the transaction was bona fide (ii) that the lime was  actually applied to arable land.    The first point could normally be met by the examination of vouchers, certified by farmer and vendor, and the second by requiring the farmer to sign a certificate.     There would be  a possibility of fraud on the part of the farmer and of collusion between him and the vendor, but the great majority of transactions would take place with reputable firms and could be easily verified. It would not be so easy to ensure that the lime was in fact applied to arable land, but a system of test inspections, coupled with a fairly heavy penalty for fraud or misrepresentation, would probably be an effective deterrent.    The penalty would involve legislation.10. It would be necessary to make some provision toprevent an occupier of agricultural land, when he leaves his holding, from obtaL ning as a part of his outgoing valuation the value of the improvement effected to the holding by reason of the subvention from the Government.    Obviously the occupier is entitled to that part of the improvement which is due to his own expenditure; but insofar as the improvement has been the
Appendixresult of Government assistance, it would be necessary to ensure that it remains with the land and is not taken away in cash by the outgoing occupier, whether he was previously the tenant, or an owner.   The Ministry has carefully considered whether it would be practicable to secure what is required in this respect merely as a condition under which Government assistance will be granted.   Apparently this would not be sufficient,  as it is not possible for a tenant to contract out of his rights in regard to outgoing valuation   under the Agricultural Holdings Act.   An amendment of that Act would, therefore, be necessary so as to ensure that the outgoing valuation in the case of an occupier who has applied lime partly at his own expense and partly at the cost of the Government should be limited to the improvement of the holding insofar as it has been effected at the occupier &apos;s expense.
