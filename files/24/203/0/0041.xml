MINISTERS ELECTION ADDRESS,1929.(As settled: by the Lord.

INTRODUCTION.Four and a half years ago you returned me to Parliament and to Office as the Leader of a great majority.      Today it Is my duty to lay before you the record of my Government and its policy for the future;    and to ask at your hands a renewal of your confidence.      The Conservative Government has had to face difficulties and dangers at home and abroad which could not have been foreseen at the last Election.      In spite of all obstacles we have fulfilled pledges given in 1924 to an extent which no Government has equalled and as a result of our administration the Empire is more firmly united, the prestige of the country stands higher, the prosperity and welfare of our people Is greater, than ever before in our history.      In submitting myself to the electorate I make no spectacular promises for a sudden transformation of our social ?r industrial conditions, but I am resolved to maintain and consolidate the advance already made,- to bring x-o fruition the schemes on which we are engaged, and to carry still further the solid work of reconstruction on which depend the unity of the Empire and the peace and well-being of its people. *
I.    THE BMP7333.The Imperial Conference of 192s will remain aEeKisi*al3le landnark i;; the c-ons-tituticnal development cfthe British Empire.      The policy of any British G-cvernme.nrtthencf the future must bo based on the principle       laid down:   that the unity cf the British Cocnmenwealth is to he maintained by unfettered co-operation between its partner members, who enjoy an equal freedom under the Crown-.This principle has consistently inspired and shaped our policy^      In foreign affairs, in defenoe. in trade and in migration we have worked, and shall work to prcV-iote unity of aim and every form of helpful, coper-consideration with-the BpminionSo
Imperial Preferenoe.Among these forms of      -operation none is of greater importance than the policy of Imperial Preference,.     That policy we have consistently and successfully pursued from the first moment of our entry Into office.     Reversing the unwise action of our predecessors we at cnoe honoured all the undertakings given at the Imperial Economic Conference of 1925, partly by the preferential remission of existing duties, and partly by the establishment of the Empire Marketing Board.      The preferences to which Tje then gave effect have since been stabilised and extended with excellent results. In sugar, tobacco, silk^ fsoffee, cvooa, dried fruits, wine, there has been a great expansion of Empire production. The Empire Marketing Board he;a proved its value as a new agency of Imperial cornperatlon in many ways-, and iwt least by its encouragement of scientific research-both in Britain and in the Dominions and Colonies.      Throughout the Empire our policy has met with an appreciative response.     The Empire te-day is by far our best market, buying as much of our manufactures as all foreign countries together,.      Cur opponents, both Liberal and Socialist, have, by their action in 1924 and by their declarations since,  shown their determined hostility to the whole idea of Imperial Preference. We,  on the contrary, have demonstrated its great possibilities and subject to my pledge not to impose any protective taxation on food, ve shall continue to promote it as an essential part of our policy of Imperial sieve 1 opinent.
C o lorJ. a I. ..Dey:g 1 o pii^nt^In working ourfe a poll cry of imperial development, we havea special duty towards the vast colonial territories for whichthe British nation Is responsible.     That duty was defined atthe end of last century by Joseph Chamberlain, when he declared .that these territories should be treated as the undevelopedestates of the British Empire to be developed by Britishcapital and British enterprise.    Such a task is frequently beyondthe unaided resour-oas of the Colony c&amp;ncerned, for trade and population will follow rather than precede the opening up of thecountry *     For this purpose transport must be improved and production must be stimulated by scientific research, butcapital expended upon these subjects may often bring in noreturn for several&apos;year a *. 1*We proppce&apos;therefore to extend and expedite the policy already pursued in Africa and elsewhere, whiok. in the past 4-g-years has resulted in sc^oat an expansian ijvthe Colonial market for British pr^vdrxcss-.     A Colonial Beve^r^ent Fund will be created which will assist ColonlaJL Borernmegbs in finland-anoing approved, pr-ojeots-of development.While thus fulfilling our responsibilities-tcws^rds the native populations and towards those of our own raas. who have linked their fortunes/wirbfe-thea, we regard tho employment cf British capital to finance British enterprise as likely to prove a more fruitful investment for this country then speculative loans ^r guarantees to a fcreign G-ckser-nmerit which has-:- squandered its own resources in a futile war against oapitcjJLsm and which has hitherto shown neither a friendly disposition to xvs xioxv any readiness t* i*ecognise past obligations.
This policy of Empire development forms part of a compre-hensive programme directed to stimulate trade and to create permanent employment0     The following are the main features in that programme. Safeguarding.First,  we are pressing steadily on with our policy of helping special industries.      The country has watched with keen interest the progress and effect of safeguarding.     Few people are interest-ed in catchwords;    they want to judge by practical results.      The results of the duties which have been imposed are already apparent. Net only has employment been increased in every one of the safe-guarded industries,  but coal,  steel, engineering, bxiilding,  trans-port and other industries have benefitted by orders received and work created.     The employment thus given directly and indirectly has put thousands of men in work, has increased their purchasing power and has thus benefitted the distributive trades.      Prices have not risen, with unimportant exceptions;    many have gone down, because costs of production have fallen with increased output. Exports over the whole range cf dutiable articles have materially increased;    efficienc?/&quot; has been encouraged;   new capital has been introduced;    new factories have been built and existing factories have been extended.      This  experience has  convinced many people of the wisdom of our policy.      Our opponents have consistently obstructed this policy and are committed to its reversal,  a step which must throw thousands out of work.      We on the other hand are determined to continue it.      We pledged ourselves/ at the last Election that there should be no protective taxation of food and that there should be no general tariff.      We have kept that pledge and we renew it.     But,  subject to that pledge, we intend that no manufacturing industry,  large or small,  shall be debarred from presenting its case for a safeguarding duty to an impartial tribunal,  vtaich will decide erfch case cn its merits.
Export Credits.One nf the main purposes of safeguarding duties, as of empire development,  is to stimulate the expert trade. The decrease-:  of our exports as compared with 1913 is probably one main cause-.8 of unemployment.      For that reason, we are taking steps to improve and extend the export credits scheme which has proved ^f great benefit to industry,
Rating Relief.No greater stimulus could, however, he given to the  export trade than the great scheme of rating relief which we have carried through in the face of persistent opposition from our political opponents, and which we are now putting into force.      By relieving the whole of productive industry from three-fourths of the burden of rates we have not only swept away an unjust form of taxation but have greatly Increased the competitive power of our national Industries.      This is no temporary or sporadic encouragement.      It is on the contrary a continuing benefit, which will add about  27,000,000 every year to the resources of industry. This unprecedented measure of relief operates universally, The assistance is greatest where the need is greatest; but it is not merely a subsidy to the depressed industries it is an essential feature of the scheme that it should also encourage the prosperous Industries in which we rely to create new employment, and the distribution trades will benefit by the increased purchasing power of the wage earners.
Ra (IV)/ay Fre i ght s .One important part of the Rating Reform Scheme h3S already been brought into operation the production of railway freights.      By this means the heavy basic Industries have been granted reductions of freights amounting in all to mere than  3 millions a year, while agriculture is benefitted by similar relief amounting to over  -f of a million.      Already this reduction is having marked effect on the recovery of these industries.
The &quot;tsasio Industries and the. Railways.Here we approach; the central problem of our national trade.      The heavy basic industries of Britain - the coal, iron and steel group - depend upon the railways. Their traffics can only be carried along the steel track. They employ a fifth of our insured wage earners, contain more than a quarter of the whole number of the unemployed and constitute with cotton and. woollens two-thirds of our export trade.      It is to this point especially that help must be directed if unemployment is to be swiftly and effectually reduced to normal.     The raijlng relief scheme and particularly the reduction of railway freights and dock dues is designed to afford a special measure of assistance to these industries and to agriculutre\ire, The remission of the railway passenger duty in the Budget has enabled the railways to undertake a programme of capital expenditure amounting to  6^ millions;,   which will assist to modernize and develop the means of transport, and will facilitate the use of heavier rolling stock. In our view the basic trades of Britain which have to depend on the railways ,as their principal means of transport ; ought to have at their disposal facilities at least equal to any transportation system in any part of the world,, The Government will take such further steps as may seem to them necessary to assist the Railways and the industries concerned to achieve this end.
While we atTt&amp;ah Bpeal^L^js^oyp^Bsuze to railway development we reg&amp;iae&apos;- the part which our great M.g&amp;vrays must play in a national transportation system.The last five years have seen the buijjiing and improvement of roads upon the greatest scale yet known, although our roads are already the best in the world, and welare spending more upon them than any European nation.At the present time we are making provision for an amsuai expenditure from the Road Fund of  23 millionsy- as compared with  15 millions in the year in which ws took office, while the total expenditure on roads out of rates and taxes amounts&apos;to approximately  60 millions a year. The percentages of State contribution to the various classes- of roads have been increased, and the problem of rural roads has been met by&apos; substantial, increases in the grants towards them.Throughout its tenure of office the policy of the Government has been to encourage and assist highway authorities to pursue a comprehensive and orderly programme of road development, improvement and maintenance.We intend to pursue this policy, paying special attention to the improvements which will give immediate^ assistance to our trade and thus bring in a full return for the money expended, rather than to put in hand hasty and ill considered schemes which could only Tleacf to wasteful and unfruitful expenditure, and could be of no permanent benefit to the unemployed.
Electrical Development.If modern -industry needs an efficient&quot; trans-port at ion system,  it needs no less a fully adequate supply of electrical power.      There has teen no more remarkable achievement in recent times than the re-organisation of the generation and transmission of electricity in Great Britain which was effected by the Electricity (Supply) Act, Progress under that Act has been rapid.      It was passed at the end of 1926;    In March 1927, the Central Electricity Board was established and by the coming Autumn detailed schemes will have been prepared covering about 97 per cent o-f the population and 98 per cent of the present sales of current.     The placing of contracts in respoet of the constructional vfork on the transmission system has been pressed on, and the total value of orders already placed amounts to  8,500.060, all of which have been placed with British firms.     Further substantial orders will be placed during the year and unemployment in the skilled electrical trades is practically non-existent.
Training;While we are thus directing cur policy primarily to the permanent restoration of industrial prosperity, on which the solution of the unemployment problem depends, we have also undertaken a wide range cf subsidiary measures designed to enable the unemployed, especially in the depressed areas, to find permanent work.Training Centres have been established which havealready enabled thousands  of men and women tc fit themselves     *for new employment.     The system of juvenile unemploymentcentres has been greatly developed,  and more than 250,000boys and girls have passed through these centres.     As aresult of these and other measures, the problem of juvenile unemployment has been largely overcome.     There is nowlittle unemployment among boys and girls, except in thedepressed mining areas, and ac  a result of the arrangementsmade while we have been in office,  practically every boyin these areas can now attend an unemployment centre whenhe is unemployed, and there be fitted for a carefully chosenjob elsewhere.We shall steadily expand our training system, as needpublierequires, and we shall continue to provide mo*ey for/works with due regard to the requirements of industry where the use&apos; ofpublic credit is necessary.
The Past and the Future In Industry.The policy outlined above has already justified itself.     Employment improved under our administration until the Spring of 1926 when,  for the first time since the great depression of 1920, the number of unemployed fell belcv a million.     Trade then suffered a severe set-back owing to the General Strike and the industrial troubles of 1926.      In the last two years it has made a remarkable recovery.In the insured industries other than the coal-mining industry there are now 800,000 more people employed and 125,000 fewer unemployed than when we assumed office.     The oosl industry itself is now reviving; many thousands of miners displaced by the re-organisation of the industry have been absorbed into other industries and there are    150,000    fewer miners unemployed than nine months ago,This recovery has been achieved by the combined efforts of our people assisted by the Governments policy of helping industry to help itself,,     The establishment of stable conditions at home and abroad has given industry confidence and opportunity.A new spirit of co-operation is abroad in Industry. Fewer days have been lost through, trade disputes in 1927 and 1923 than in any year since records were established forty years ago.     Negotiations on a friendly basis are proceeding between the partners in industry.
If such co-oporation continues with peace at home and abroad,  and if full effect is given toyv ithe Governments proposals for helping trade, thereis every reason to believe that trade and industry willbe placed on a sound basis and that men and womenat their proper trades will find permanent employment/in steadily increasing numbers -
fffae righta and welfare of the partners in trade and industry. This peace and revival in industry opens the way to. yv,ia revision and improvement of the Factory Laws.     This is the one pledge we gave at the last election which we have been unable to fulfil.      It was impossible to legislate wisely for industry while still torn by dissessions and harassed by the uncertainties following the troubles of 1926. In our view the time has now arrived for the enactment of a single and clearly drafted statute which shall protect the health, safety and general welfare of the workers without imposing on industry &quot;burdens which might retard its recovery.Factory legislation of this kind will complete the work we have already done to give greater security to the partners in trade and industry.     By the legislation we have passed during our term of office we have given both to the business tenant and to his assistants a measure of security which they have long demanded.     By the Trades Disputes Act the Trades Unions were protected against the misuse of the strike weapon for political and revolutionary ends, and the Trade Unionist has been secured against intimidation and coercion in the free exercise of his industrial and political rights.     The threat of the Socialist Party to repeal this Act is in itself a ground for asking the -support of the workers for the present Government.
Agriculture.Our policy fcr agriculture has been consistently directed, and will continue to be directed, to the relief of burdens, the finding of markets,  the provision of credit facilities, and the development of education and research.We have crowned the Conservative policy of relieving the essential equipment of agriculture, its land and farm buildings, from unfair burdens by the entire remission of local rateso     We have found it possible to advance our programme by bringing this relief into immediate operation. We have thus conferred upon the agricultural Industry a benefit of not less than ?,\ million for the year ending October 1,  1929 and nearly 5 millions In a full yearD      The substantial rebates on railway freight chax^ges for certain agricultural traffics wkich we have also secured by our derating scheme, and the special grants made from the Road Fund towards the maintenance and Improvement of roads in rural areas, with consequent relief to local rates, are further instances of the same policy of easing the burdens cf agriculture.VJe have endeavoured to increase the farmer&apos;s profits by helping him to reform the methods of marketing agricultural produce.     We are surveying the whole marketing system of the country.     New methods of standardised grading and packing have been introduced and under the Agricultural Produce (Grading and Marking) Act,  1928, agricultural products can now be sold in standard grades under a National Mark*      A most successful beginning has been made In the application of the Mark to eggs and certain kinds of fruit and vegetables *Provision has also been made for the marking of imported foodstuffs in suitable cases.The policy of p?reference to the home producer has been steadily pressed by the Empire Marketing Board and is already-lo- /shewing
showing results.In order to give a lead in this matter by direct government exarnpie we have decided that in future only home fedbeef shall be supplied to the Army- Air Forces and Wavy in Home Portsafter harvest 2\b% of the flour used for these services shall be milled from home grown wheat 0We have initiated a long called for reform In the finance of British agriculture by the Agricultural Credits Act under which both long term and short term credits are being provided; tconsiderable advantage is already being taken by the farming community, of these provisions.Large sums have been provided for improving the drainage of agricultural land, and we propose to introduce legislation, based on the Report of the recent Royal Commission, which should give a fresh stimulus to this work3Recognising that arable farming has been specially affected by the depression in agriculture we have vigorously supported and developed the infant sugar beet Industry, with results which have already exercised a marked influence on the prosperity of agriculture, particularly in the eastern part of England.We have ensured throughout England and Wales that the minimum and overtime rates of wages of agricultural workers prescribed under the Agricultural Wages Act of 1924 are being paid, and where necessary we have secured the enforcement of the Act through the medium of the Courts 0We have extended the facilities.for Small Holdings both for renting and purchase by easy instalments, Including a new type of cottage holding.,  and legislation has also been passed facilitating the provision of allotments.We also propose to afford the public in rural areas improved telephone facilities.-,     The radius from the nearest exchange within   -which, a telephone is provided without extra&apos; mileage charge will be 3x.tond.ed from 1$ to 2 miles.during the six months october to March, and that during six months
Gall offices &quot;Will &quot;b-s provide-d. at- s-Mr 5,000 rural post offices which have at present neither telegraph nor telephone facilities and armors than 1,000 rural railway stations.Tho alectrification of rural areas will he greatly facilitated by the transnissxon system provided under tho Electricity Act.Taken together these measures constitute a practical policy.      They have proved, and. will increasingly prove   thoir value as a contribution to the re-establishment  .. of British agriculture.      It is a policy which enables the costs of production to be rgduoed and tho ?*arxeting of agricultural produce to ho improved.But such a policy must bo assisted by all the resources of modern science and skill.      To this end wo have greatly extended the provision for agricultural education and research, and have directed the attention of teachers in the elementary and secondary schools to the need for closer co-operation between those Soheols and the industry of agriculture.      The further extension of this work will bo one of our main cares.We are utterly opposed both to natJo-nal 3sa-tion the land and to bureaucratic control, the policies- of our Socialist and Liberal opponents.     We do not believe that these expedients can ever overcome the difficulties    &apos; confronting tho Agricultural Industry, orbring prosperity to those who live by the land.
Fisheries.We recognise the great importance of the fishing industry.     We have given and shall continue to give financial assistance towards all forma of research &quot;beneficial to the industry including the search for new fishing grounds and the Investigations now being conducted into the preservation of fish, its transport and the use of by-products,     A start has been made to develop the fish canning industry.and&quot;Ws are taking steps to help the herring/inshore fisher-men by improving harbour facilities, by lightening the burden of existing loans and by the reduction of harbour dues.Share-fishermen have been included in the National Health Insurance scheme and can now qualify for the Contributory Old Age Pensions.-18-
III.    SOCIAL R5F0RI/T.The Conservative Party regards the prosperity q . trade and industry, not as an end in Itself, but as a means to improve the condition of the people.      During our tenure of office we have Quarried through a great programme of social welfare and have thus prepared the ground for the further programme which we now lay before the country.
Pensions.At the last Election a promise was given that a Conservative Government, if returned with an adequate majority, would complete the details of a Contributory Scheme of pensions.for Widows, Orphans and old people at an earlier age, without the irritating enquiries and restrictions that had accompanied the earlier scheme cf pensions at 70 and would put this scheme into operation as soon as practicable.      That promise was fulfilled in the first nine months of our career and already one and three-quarter million persons havo been awarded pensionsj and allowances&apos;und^r our Act.Housing and the problem of the slums.&quot;&apos;e also promised special attention to tiie vigorous promotion of housing -schemes and the 930,000 houses which have been built during our term of office, providing accommodation for nearly four&apos; millions of people,  constitute a record in this respect in the history of the world,Realising that the most pressing need is for houses whieh can be let at lower rents, we have reduced the subsidy which was keeping up prices
and this measure has been so successful that since It was announced the average cost of anon-parlour house has been reduced by no lessthan  112.      With this encouragement LocalAuthorities are now pla.influencing fresh centrantsand we shall continue to urge them to buildhouses,-for the lower paid workers until theshortage, which for this class still remainsacute, is completely overcame.Meanwhile, the success already achievedhas made it possible to attack with a new prospectof success the formidable problem of the slumsfind a siwhich hafe hitherto baffled all attempts tp       /&apos; Plans for the Improvement of the present procedure in slum clearance are far advanced. The present basis, of compensation&quot; to owners, the unfairness of which has had a delaying effect, will be amended after consultation with the various Interests concerned.     New powers will be given to Local Authorities in England and Fairs /&quot;&quot;enabling them to undertake the reconditioning of old houses after acquisition and providing for an enlightened system of careful and sympathetic management./ Where improvement schemes of this kind are carried out it will be possible so to control the tenancies as to put an end t-* the/
exploitation of sub-tenants who occupy furnished or unfurnished rooms and who are often in no position to protect themselves against undue charges. The corresponding problem in Scotland will be dealt with by measures adapted to the special conditions of that country. Rent Restriction Acts.The continuance of these Acts in their present form has created hardship for certain owners of small houses.      But whatever modifications may be made to mitigate their difficulties the protection afforded to tenants by these Acts will not be removed until the shortage of h/ruses has been overcome sufficiently to warrant such a course. Local Government.By the adjustment of financial relations between Local Authorities and the Exchequer an increased national contribution will be directed to the places mostly In need of it.      Under the previsions of the scheme, the vast majority of rate-payers will gain materially. Welfare of mothers and children.Under the p-resent administration special Jattention has been given to mothers and children. The net work of ante-natal clinics and infant welfare centres has been greatly extended and largely owing to these measures Infant mortality has been reduced from 75 tc 65 per 1000 of the population.      The provisions cf the Local Government
Act may be expected to facilitate further expansion of this service in those places where it is most needed by directing to them an Increased proportion of the Exchequer contributions to local expenditure.We desire, however,  that this expansion should be carried beyond the infant welfare centres, whose work is chiefly concerned with children up to 1 year old.     The school medical service Is now providing treatment every year for half a million more school children than in 1924y but there is still a gap between the work of this service and that of the infant welfare centres.     Existing agencies such as nursery schools, have done much and can do more to solve this prob3.em, but the gap cannot be bridged by these means alone.     Vlhile encouraging these agencies, therefore, we shall also immediately undertake a comprehensive enquiry Into the best methods cf providing for the health and welfare of children between 1 and 5 years of age.
Another enquiry is already being carried out intpthe causes of maternal mortality,  and&apos; it is expected that when completed it will throw fresh light upon this grave and urgent problem,      In the meanwhile the Gov-ern-ment have come to the conclusion that the maternity benefit under the national Health Insurance Scheme might be more effectively utilised in the preservation of the health and life of mothers, and they purpose to reorga-nise this provision so as to ensure that proper and adequate midwifery and medical services shall be available to all mothers.,Finally,  the. national provision for child welfare needs to be completed by measures designed to protect the interests of 62.ft.lr children.      Several committee os appointed during our term of office have examined this question and have recommended important reforms.&quot;    One. of our first measures in the next Parliament will be a Bill to consolidate and improve the Acts relating to children and young people and to bring them into -conformity with enlightened opinion.
Welfare of the Blind..Among the sooial services-which affect only a limitel number of the population are the provisions male for the welfare of the Blind.     Much has been done to ease the lot of those who are thus afflicted,and many are now enabled by special training to make at least a considerable contribution towards their own support.    . Pensions are provided at the age ftf 50 for such as have not sufficient moans of their own to be independent, but since at that age it is difficult, if not impossible for a blind person   to take advantage of the training facilities provided,, the- Government have come to- the- oonnluBi-on--4:bat--^a.r)i:t.i.oriR -jxhxm 1 fl .-bp:,27naff&apos;ar-a.-ra.iTfiffiT earlier In life and if they should be returned to power they will i.jibrod.voo- .1 pgislatioy to JB&amp;Tre  the pensionable age 10- *ru? i&apos;.aai of &apos; 50.
Education&apos;.As at&apos; the last election, we are.-issuing-a. separa-jyy statement of our education policy.-     In that statement we show the progress we have raade in carrying cut tho pledges we gave fonr years age,  and we renew those pledges. Further, we place before the electors for tho first time a complete and balanced  scheme of education which has behind it the support both of education reformers and of the trades and industries of the country^      This scheme,  for which we shall pass the necessary legislation,  will offer to all our people the opportunity to pursue a connected course of study from childhood to manhood,  and will give to each phase of education - primary,   secondary,  technical and uniyersity - Its proper place in one coherent structure. In this task we need the co-operation of all types of school ana every kind of educational   effort,  and we-therefore pledge ourselves actively to sgek an agreed settlement which will enable provided and non-provided schools to work together for the accomplishment n  these reforms upon just terms of partnership.      We need,  tooj the speedy completion of the reconditioning of all defective school premises in the interests of the children who attend them,   and we propose to bring forward a special measure for this purpose.     We need,  finally, the/services of a teaching profession enjoying security of remuneration and professional prospects, and we shall endeavour to com-&apos; lets the work in this direction which has already been carried so far during the past four years.
Great War Pensionera.By the end of this year the country will have spent on Great War Pensions  913,000,000,  a sum greater in amount than the combined expenditure of France and Germany on the same object.War pensioners have been relieved by the Government1s action from any anxiety that the rates of their pensions tirlght be reduced owing to the fall in the cost of living.400,000 officers and men have been given security of    pensions for life by the policy of final aware    which is being,  and will be,   steadily pursued.      Altogether over 800,000 men and women have been made secure in the possession of their tTar pensions.Arrangements have been made whereby exceptional * cases of all kinds can and do receiy-o pensionbeyond the seven years&quot;  time limit.-24-
. Tho Household and, the Family.Great as are the benefits conferred upon the community by the public social services, the happiness of the individual depends primarily upon the conditions of his home life.   During these four years there has been a substantial improvement in those conditions. Over the working population as a whole wage rates have risen slightly while there has been a marked fall in the cost of living.Tho reduction of 6a in the standard rate of Income Tax,together with the increase in the earned, income allowance and in the rates of children1s allowances for income tax purposes has effected a striking diminution in the burden of direct taxation, especially in the case cf the family man who is dependent for his livelihood upon his own labours. In the sphere of indirect taxation we have abolished altogether the Tea Duty which has been in existence for over 300 years, and by our rearrangement of the Sugar Duties we have effected a reduction of ^d a lb in the price of sugar to the consumer, and this reduction has been doubled in consequence of world market conditions.    3ut these contributions to a reduction in the cost of living are far transcended by the general reduction which has taken place as a result of the&apos; Government1 s policy In returning to the Gold Standard.    During our term of office wage rates over the working population as a whole have;risen slightly while the cost of living has fallen by 10$.      This fall is equivalent to a reduction of  160,000s000 a year on the household budgets of the insured wage earners of the nation alone, and if it is applied to all wages, salaries, old age pensions and war pensions, ^the increased purchasing power would be the equivalent of  240,000,000 a year.    It Is not surprising that there has been a remarkable growth in the savings and investments of the workers.This growth In the material prosperity of the home has been accompanied by a series of reforms in our legislation affecting family life.    By these reforms, such as the Acts relating to the Adoption of Children,  the Guardianship of Infants, Legitimacy and the Age of Marriage, we have sought especially to improve the position of women and children.
Economy.It is this steady improvement in the resources and spending power of the individual home which should form the main object of our national financial policy.     Our opponents in all their echemes to gain votes never count the cost in cash or credit.     Yet money is the measure of all that can be done.      We are told that immense new burdens are to be placed upon the direct taxpayer by the Socialist Party, and formidable drains upon our  credit will be made by the Liberals.     All this will simply be ?v&amp;ken from the common stock,  and the saving power and economic energy of the country will be reduced accordingly. We do not think that this a time for imposing new and heavy taxes and it is certainly most nedessary to nourish by every means the financial credit upon which  the whole activity of industry and enterprise  depends.      Instead of placing heavy new burdens upon the taxpayer, the process of strict and steady economies in every branch of the public service must continue to be pursued with the aim of lightening the public burdens and leaving larger sums of money to fruotify in the pockets of the people.      The large savings which we have made on armaments are already apparent,  and it is to be hoped that International agreements and further departmental economies will &apos;continue this process in the new Parliament, provided always that national safety is not jeopardised.
House of Inrdp Ref orm.I do not wish to refer to the question of Second Chamber reform in this Address beyond saying that as soon as public opinion has matured on this subject it will be my duty to give lb my close attention with a view of finding a satisfactory solution.** Hote &quot;by the Lord Chancel lor.On re-reading this passage I feel that it is very weak and think that it would be much better- omitted especially In the interests of those in favour of Reform.Ho2 6 A.
IV.    PEACE ABROAD. The promotion, of peace and disarmament has been the prime object of our foreign policy,  and that policy has proved successful over the whole field of foreign affairs.     Under the guarantees given by the Treaty of Locarno,  security, on which peace depends, has been assured in Europe,  and Germany has entered the League of Nations.      This security has been extended from Europe to the whole world by the signature of the Kellogg Pact, under which all nations have solemnly undertaken to renounce war as an instrument of policy and so have assumed the obligation to settle international disputes by peaceful means.The improvement in the international situation wrought by these important treaties leads us to look with confidence for an early advance towards disarmament.      We stand for the reduction and not merely the limitation of armaments and in this field we have set a notable example.Despite the emergence of the Royal Air Force as a third fighting service and the additional defence responsibilities we have assumed for the L2andated Territories, the combined strength of the three Services is to-day substantially lower than the cor.responding figure for the Navy and Army before the War.Pari passu with this reduction in fighting strength, we have progressively reduced the cost of Imperial Defence, despite the considerable prograjumes of replacement and re-armament in all three Services necessitated by modern conditions In 1929-30 the combined Estimates of the Navy, Army and Royal Air Force amount to  112,500,000, a reduction of approximately  7,500,000 as compared with the corresponding cost in 1924-25.
The development of the League cf Nations Is a cardinal principle of our foreign policy.     The importance attached by the present Government to the work of the League is illustrated by the fact that Great Britain has been contin-uously represented by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs on the Council and in the Assembly of the League.We welcome,  as the fruit of this consistent policy, the advance, recently made at Geneva towards an international agreement for the reduction of armaments and we greatly hope for a further advance in this direction on the lines of the proposals foreshadowed by the representatives of the United States of America.As in European and world politics, so also in the special affairs of the Middle and the Far East, we have shown our desire and our ability to settle differences and promote friendly relations.      In the case of both Turkey and China where we were confronted with special difficulties, our policy has fully justified itself:    It has re-established old friendships and afforded new opportunities for British export tradeoWe shall continue In every sphere of foreign policy to act in the closest consultation and co-operation with the Governments of the Dominions^     We believe this to be essential if the unity of the Empire and its influence in the councils of the  world is to be maintained.Finally we stand for the scrupulous execution of all international engagements,   in accordance with the traditions of this country.Peroration (to be drafted by the Prime Minister)
