I Tiiis Document is the Property of His Baatannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]230Printed for the Cabinet.   April 1929.SECRET.Copy No.28CP. 124 (29).CABINET.GRANT OF GENERAL SERVICE MEDAL FOR OPERATIONS AGAINSTTHE AKHWAN TRIBES.1. I HAVE read with surprise the memorandum (CP. 119 (29) ) which the Secretary of State for War has circulated on this subject and must most emphatically dissent from his contention that the proposed grant of the General Service Medal to personnel who took part in the operations against the Akhwan tribes would &quot; cheapen &quot; or &apos;&apos; debase &quot; that award.2. Until reading the Secretary of State for Wars memorandum, I have been under the impression that the Army was as desirous as the Air Force to use the mechanical side in warfare to lessen the loss of human life. Only a few days previously the Chief of the Imperial General Staff in another connection had referred to the need :t from the broad social and humanitarian point of view &quot; of economising man power by the use of material.3. I can sympathise to some extent with the Secretary of State for War&apos;s difficulties so far as they may arise from the wording of the Royal Warrant (Article 653). The words &quot; arduous campaigns and well-fought and well-sustained battles and sieges &quot; are redolent of the wars of Marlborough and of Uncle Toby and Corporal Trim rather than of the conditions of modern warfare. Early opportunity might be taken of bringing the wording of the Article more up to date, but even in its present form the Royal Warrant can, I submit, be reasonably and intelligently interpreted to justify fully the recommendation in this matter which was put forward by the Interdepartmental Rewards Committee with the approval of the members from all the departments represented thereon, except the War-Office.4. I hardly think that my colleagues will wish me to deal in detail with the Secretary of State for War&apos;s arguments and comparisons, but I may remind them of a few salient facts : (a.) The operations against the Akhwan extended over a period of six months;the climatic and other physical conditions were at all times extremely , trying to the personnel engaged, whether on the ground or in the air. .&apos;(6.) A large amount of flying was carried out by the three squadrons mainly concerned nearly 7,000 hours between January and May alone. Much of this consisted of patrol and reconnaissance in the desert by machines operating singly or m pairs, under conditions of isolation which called for a high degree of self-reliance and moral courage on the part of the pilots and other personnel.(c.) Forced landings in the desert were frequent owing to the impossibility of providing repair facilities, and any of these landings might have ended fatally. The feat for which Flight-Lieutenant Barrett was awarded the D.S.O., namely, the landing under heavy fire to rescue another pilot who had been forced to land, illustrates the risks to which the personnel engaged were constantly exposed.   More than 60 forced landings wereMemorandum by the Secretary or State for Air.
recorded during the six months of the operations, and in 20 of them the aircraft had to be written off in most cases they were burnt, and in others abandoned to the enemy. (d.) Lastly, the operations were successful for the purpose for which they were directed, which was that of warding off a concentrated Wahabi attack against Iraq. Had that attack materialised, it might well have set the whole of the Middle East ablaze.5. As to the suggestion that claims for similar awards might be put forward in respect of operations in certain other areas, it seems to me that those in Penjwin and the Sudan were clearly distinguishable by their shorter duration, by their narrower objective, and by the fact that they were necessitated by internal disturbance and not by the menace of external aggression. As to Shanghai and North China, the despatch of reinforcements to those areas was a measure of pre-caution which fortunately proved to be successful without the necessity for any active operations at all.6. I do not follow the analogy which my colleague suggests between the Akhwan operations and conditions of service of the Army of Occupation on the Rhine, but it is, of course, open to the representatives of the War Office to raise a claim on behalf of the Rhine Army at the next meeting of the Interdepartmental meeting of the Rewards Committee.7. The Air arm seeks, and is able, to minimise loss of human life by enter-prising and intelligent utilisation of modern inventions. It would surely be disastrous if the forces engaged in our numerous small wars should be allowed to believe that operations in which they are engaged will be regarded as worthy of reward and distinction only in proportion to the number of casualties sustained in their execution.8. Let me illustrate my argument by a reference to the air operations which were carried out at Aden last year which succeeded in driving the Imam of the Yemen out of Protectorate Territory into which he had been encroaching for several years previously. Arduous and successful as these operations were, we have not asked for the General Service Medal to be awarded in respect of them. The only alternative method of driving the Imam out would have been by a land force. The size of that force would have been according to the opinion expressed by the Chiefs of Staff (CP. 377 (26)) one complete division (less one and three-quarter Brigades of Field Artillery). Only pack transport could have been employed, and it was estimated that 7,000 camels would be required for the purpose. There would have been the inevitable long lines of communication, and there would no doubt have been enough casualties and sick men to make the expedition noteworthy^to the War Office and to earn for it the General Service Medal.9. I cannot but feel that the Secretary of State for War, even by his own standard, applies to Air operations a severer test of eligibility for the grant of the General Service Medal than the War Office has applied to itself in the past. For example, the General Service Medal and clasp was, I believe, awarded to the troops engaged in some brief operations at Sartiru, Northern Nigeria, in 1906, in which our casualties amounted only to two officers and four or five men slightly wounded. The medal with clasp was also, I believe, awarded for some other operations in another part of Nigeria in the same year where, again, our casualties consisted only of a few men slightly wounded. I much hope, however, that my colleagues will set themselves against the view that in modern warfare the test for rewards should be lire magnitude of the casualties inflicted or received.S.
