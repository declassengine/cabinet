SECRET.&quot; Copy No.CP. 139 (29).CABINET.COMMITTEE ON PAY OF THE FIGHTING SERVICES.Taxation of Allowances.REPORT.IN accordance with the Cabinet Conclusion of the 24th April (Cabinet 18 (29) 6), we have considered the question of the taxation of money allowances paid to members of the Navy, Army and Air Force, with special reference to the taxation of Lodging money and Servants&apos; allowances in the Navy.2. In addition to the Memoranda submitted to the Cabinet by the First Lord of the Admiralty (CP. 76 (29)) and the Chancellor of the Exchequer (CP. 95 (29)), we have had before us statements expressing the views of the&apos; War Office and the Board of Inland Revenue on this matter. The latter is attached as an Appendix to this Report.3. The primary object of bur examination of the problem at this stage has been to ascertain whether, in the short time available before the Dissolution, there is any course of action which can properly be taken by His Majesty&apos;s Government to remedy or mitigate the tax inequalities existing between the Navy and the Army. We have given the matter careful consideration, but are of opinion that there is no such course of action which we can recommend.4. It would not be possible to rule by a simple clause in the Finance Bill that Naval officers should in future be taxed on the same basis as Army officers, because Army officers themselves are not taxed on any consistent principle.5. The position within a single Service is full of anomalies, which appear to us to be of no less significance than those existing between the different Services. Legislative action involves as a preliminary a clear definition of a basis of taxation applicable to all the Services. The total exemption of all allowances from taxation would be such a basis, but there are weighty objections to this course, as is pointed out in the Memorandum by the Board of Inland Revenue, and we do not think that a decision to this effect should be taken without a fuller consideration of the question in all its bearings than can be given in the short time immediately available to us.6. We are, nevertheless, strongly impressed with the necessity for clearing up the existing inequalities. In the ordinary course the first step to this end is to ascertain by reference to the Law Officers the true requirements of the existing law. Such a ruling is almost certain to create a position of some difficulty through the alterations to which it will lead in the existing incidence of taxation. It appears, however, to be an indispensable preliminary to placing the whole system on a proper basis. In addition, all the Services have asked for it.[19248]j this Document is the Property of His Britannio Majesty^ Gowning., t. j Printed for the Cabinet.   May 1929.
7. It will be borne in mind that, in the War Office view, if a final settlement of the legal position entails more taxation than at present, it will be necessary for them to press for equivalent increases either in allowances or in pay. This represents one aspect to be considered. On the other hand, if the situation were considered to call for legislative action to secure that allowances in whole or in part are exempted from taxation, the Government would be in a position to state to Parliament a reasoned case for the course it recommends, in full appreciation of the significance of the existing law. Their view would certainly be less open to misrepresentation than if a decision to the same effect were taken now without the preliminary reference to the Law Officers.8. We consider, therefore, that the whole question should be referred to the Law Officers; but, since no ruling could be received for some considerable time, we think that it would be more appropriate that a decision to this effect should be taken by the Government after the General Election.9. We have considered carefully whether, in the meantime, the complaint of the Admiralty could be met, as a purely temporary measure, by the granting of compensatory increases in Naval officers&apos; allowances, pending the straightening out of the whole basis of taxation. The Naval lodging and servants&apos; allowances are on a totally different basis from those of the Army and Air Force; the inequality complained of consists in the fact of taxation in the case of the Navy and non-taxation in the case of the latter two, and not in the receipt by officers of different net amounts in respect of the same services. This inequality results in the charge on the Lodging and Servants&apos; allowances of Naval Officers of a total tax of about  13,000 per annum. In order to ascertain whether this charge forms an unjustifiable burden on Naval Officers, it would be necessary to undertake an assessment of the relative financial position of officers of the three Services, a comparison into which total emoluments, pay and allowances must enter.10. We think that the amount in question is so small in comparison with the total pay rolls of officers of the three Services that it cannot be said to be a factor seriously disturbing the general relativity of emoluments. We are unable, therefore, to find any remedy in this direction, and we cannot recommend that any such temporary increase in Naval allowances should be authorised.11.   Our conclusions, therefore, are as follows :-(a.) That it is desirable that steps should be taken to rectify the tax anomalies existing both within the Services and as between the different Services.(b.) That the first step to this end is to refer the whole question to the Law Officers, to ascertain the true liability to taxation under the existing law, leaving decisions of future policy to be taken in the light of the Law Officers&apos; opinion.(c.) That the question whether such reference should be made to the Law Officers should be decided,by the Cabinet after the General Election.(d.) That, in the meantime, there is no suitable temporary remedy which would mitigate the inequalities existing as between the Navy and the other Services.Signed on behalf of the Committee :JOHN GILMOUB, Chairman.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.

APPENDIX.Liability to Income Tax in Respect of Money Allowances Paid to Members ofthe Navy, Army and Air Eorce.Memorandum by the Board of Inland Revenue.1. THE treatment for Income Tax purposes of the Lodging Allowance and Servant Allowance paid to Naval Officers is bound up with the question of the liability of the numerous other allowances paid to members of the Navy, Army and Air Force. It is also inseparably connected with the much wider question of the taxation of money allowances in general, given for various purposes as additions to the pay, salary, stipend, &amp;o, of many classes of taxpayer.2. Income Tax practice as regards allowances paid to members of the Services (which include, e.g., Command Pay, Extra Duty Pay, Ration Allowance, Colonial Allowance, &amp;c.) has grown up in a haphazard manner, over a long period, in the hands of the several bodies of Departmental Commissioners. Exemptions given with or without authority, showing little attempt at correlation, and sometimes little regard to the law, had already become established when in 1911 the position evoked unfavourable comment from the Public Accounts Committee. In varying degrees the practice involves both inconsistency within the Services and inconsistency between the Services and other professions.3. These anomalies were emphasised after the War by the high rates of tax, and in May 1922 the Admiralty requested that the Law Officers should be consulted in regard to the Lodging Allowance and certain other allowances. With the approval of the then Chancellor of the Exchequer (Sir Robert Home), the preparation of a Case, jointly with the Admiralty, the War Office and the Air Ministry the Departments concerned was undertaken with a view to obtaining the opinion of the Law Officers over the whole wide field of the allowances. The drafting of this Case has proved to be an exceedingly intricate and lengthy task, but it is now complete.4. The view taken by the Board of Inland Revenue is that the law requires all these money allowances to be taxed, subject in some cases to relief on account of necessary expenses. But they concur in the opinion that, in a matter so complicated, and where vested rights have grown up, an essential preliminary to attempting to tackle the problem is to obtain an authoritative and comprehensive statement of the law from the Law Officers. It would then be possible with unimpeachable authority to apply the provisions of the Taxing Acts without inequality and with a duly liberal interpretation in the measurement of allowable expenses. Any question for consideration, as regards the relative financial position of members of the several Forces, would then be purely one of comparative remuneration, without the confusion imparted by variations in the incidence of taxation.5. The Board are led to this view by an examination of the alternative courses theoretically possible.  These appear to be as follows : (a.) Taxation of the Army and Air Force allowances in the same way as the Navy allowances.It is presumed that it would be out of the question to do this unless the Law Officers confirmed the Board&apos;s view as to the taxability of the allowances.(b.) Exemption of the Navy allowances in the same way as the Army and Air Force allowances.It is equally out of the question to do this unless the Law Officers were to pronounce the Board&apos;s view to be wrong. The Naval Allowances have hitherto been taxed and, in the Board&apos;s view, are clearly within the charge to tax.(c.) The grant of compensating allowances to the Navy.This would make matters worse. To give the Navy additional allowances to compensate them for having to pay more tax than the Army would be an attempt to cure one inequality by the creation of another. It would sanction and perpetuate anomalies which the Public Accounts Committee have condemned.
(d.) Legislation to exempt the allowances in all the Services.The Board Avould entertain the very strongest objection to this as being contrary to the principles of the code which they administer.In the first place, it would offend against the basic principle of &quot; ability to pay &quot; under which the tax-burden of the individual is regulated by reference to the size of his total income. The Royal Commission on the Income Tax laid great stress on the necessity of taking into account for this purpose miscellaneous money receipts over and above ordinary regular pay or income. The cash allowances of members of the Fighting Services fall clearly within this principle, and, subject to the deduction of any necessary expenses, should be duly reckoned in the computation of the recipients total income for Income Tax purposes.In the second place, the exemption of these allowances would introduce class privilege into the Income Tax law. The Courts have repeatedly made it clear that cash payments are not taken out of the category of taxable emoluments by the mere fact that they have to be spent in a specific way. Thus, civilians in receipt of allowances for, e.g., food, lodging, &amp;c, bear tax on such payments, and legislation exempting officers&apos; allowances would set up a favoured class, the existence of which would provoke criticism and discontent among the general body of taxpayers. It is true that in the special conditions and atmosphere of the Great War (when the Fighting Services were supplemented from all civilian classes) reduced rates of taxation were, for the time being, conceded to members of the Forces. But after the War the reduced rates were repealed, and it is hardly conceivable that public opinion would be prepared to recognise members of the Fighting Services as a class apart, rightly paying tax on a more favourable basis than any other.Administrative experience suggests to the Board that it would be impossible permanently to confine the relief to the Fighting Services, and that the ultimate cost might be very great. With the publicity given to every measure of relief contained in a Finance Bill, there would inevitably be a widespread demand for similar privileges which could not logically be resisted; nor would it be long before the vast body of salaried taxpayers took steps to have their emoluments divided into two parts, (i) salary, and (ii) allowances to meet all kinds of expenditure, with a view to crettino- legislative exemption for the part described as &quot; allowances.&quot;Board of Inland Revenue, April 30, 1929.o

DRAFT OF THE KING1S-SPEECH ON THE&quot;&quot; &quot;proHoisi iw of&quot; ta:rtto^nt.MY LORDS AND MELBER3 OP THE HOUSE OF COMMONS:My relations with Foreign Powers continue to be friendly.The negotiations for My participation In the mu.ltilateral Treaty for the Renunciation of War in the form proposed by the Government of the United States were successfully concluded on March 2nd last when My ratifications of this instrument in respect of all parts of My Empire were deposited in Washington.I have entrusted My son, the Duke of Gloucester, with the Mission of conferring the Insignia of the Order of the Garter upon the Emperor of Japan as a token of My high regard for His Imperial Majesty, and as a pledge of the friendship which unites our two countries in their determination to co-operate for the peaceful settlement of international questions, both in the Far East and In the world at large.I hope that events in China will continue to show improvement and gradual progress towards more stable conditionso      I am glad that it has been possible for My Government to accord full recognition to the National Government established at Nanking and to conclude with them a Treaty recognising the principle of complete tariff autonomyo
Owing to the uncertain situation in Afghanistan and the absence of a settled Government, My Representative was  withdrawn from Kabul at the end of February.      It is MyA earnest hope that internal peace may soon be restored and a Government established which shall be accepted by the people generally and with which My Government will be able to resume the friendly intercourse of the past.My Government have continued to press for the reduction of armaments in consultation with other Governments at Geneva.     New hope of an early settlement of the question of further naval disarmament has recent-ly been   given by the speech of the United States delegate there of which My Government were not slow to express their appreciation.All My Governments have announced their intention of taking the necessary action to enable Me to accept, subject to reciprocity, the Protocol prohibiting chemical and bacteriological methods of warfare.The seven members of your two Houses, to whom, eighteen months ago,  I Issued a Commission to enquire into the working of the existing system of government in India^ have now completed the first part of their task.      They have made two journeys to India to acquire information and collect evidence for the purpose of their enquiry.      They have enjoyed the co-operation of Committees of the Provincial Legislatures, as well as that of a Committee of members of the Central Legislature who,   at the Invitation of My Government, will be associated with them also In the final stages of their enquiry.     There lies before them, to complete their
arduous task,  the duty of framing a Report which, when drawn, will be presented to the Parliament at that time assembled. I pray that success may crown their labours.It is a matter of deep satisfaction to Me that, through the proceedings at the meeting of the Imperial Conference in 1926, the foundations on which the prosperity and security of My Empire rests were still further strengthened by a declara-tion of the principles governing the relations between My Governments,  and by the recommendation of many practical measures for their mutual support and co-operation.In pursuance of the recommendations of the Imperial Conference, arrangements b;.ve been made for the meeting in London in October next of an Expert Committee on the Operation of Dominion Legislation,  consisting of representatives of My Governments, and of a Sub-Conference on Merchant Shipping Legislation..Amongst the measures taken by My Ministers during their term of office to encourage inter-Imperial trade, there stands out the setting up of the Empire Marketing Board in 1926.      I am confident that the establishment of the Board,  which has devoted constant attention and activit;; to its special&apos; function of promoting the marketing of Empire produce, including home agricultural produce,  in this country, has done, and will do, much to bring home to My People the practical advantages of the development of commercial relations between all parts of the. Empire.
Steady progress has been made with the development of the Colonies, Protectorates and Mandated Territories, more particularly in the matter of communications, the promotion of scientific agriculture, the Improvement of health conditions and the encouragement of education. A clearer Insight into the problems of the Colonial Empire has been gained by the holding of the first Colonial Office Conference of Governors in 1927 when matters of common Interest came under discussion, and by means of a number of missions, parliamentary and official, sent to examine and report upon specific questions of outstanding importanceoMEMBERS OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS:I thank you for the provision you have made for the public service.MY LORDS AND MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS:The number of persons unemployed in certain Industries during the past year has continued to cause anxiety, but a substantial improvement has taken place and there are good grounds for the belief that we are moving towards a higher level of employment In all parts of the country.      The re-organisation of industry, and its deve3cpment in new channels, are steadily proceeding and, with continued co-operation and good-will between employers and workers, will lay the foundation for a lasting Improvement.      It is clear, however,  that owing
3o to the altered needs of industry a redistribution of workers must take place on a large scale and it has been the policy of My Ministers to aid and guide this movement by schemes of training and transference.I have given My assent to the measures giving effect tc the comprehensive scheme which has been before you for reforming the rating system on a more equitable basis,  for the re-organisation of local government and for the re-adjustment of the financial relations between the State and the local authorities.     The limited measure of relief from rates which it has been possible to give in respect of selected industrial and agricultural traffics in anticipation of the general scheme has proved of value.      It is a hopeful augury of the greater and more widespread benefits that should accrue, particularly to the basic trades whose conditions are least satisfactory, when the full scheme of relieving agriculture and other productive industries from the burden of rates comes into force.I have given My assent to a measure providing that in the case of agriculture this relief shall come into force immediately. ,My Ministers anticipate that the reforms in local government,  which include recommendations made by My Commissioii on Local Government, and the re-organisation of the financial relations between the State and the Local authorities will promote efficiency/ and economy in local administration, will enable better provision to be made for the health and welfare of the people, and will
9 9 9 Oddin particular direct special relief to those areas whose needs are most pressing.Progress continues to be made in the provision of houses,and the reductions in costs which are being secured should materially facilitate the erection of houses for the less well-paid members of the community.My Ministers have initiated an enquiry into the radium requirements of the country in the light  of the knowledge and experience gained as to the importance of radium in the treatment of cancer, and in accordance with the recommendation made to them they have agreed to contribute to a fund for the acquisition of a stock of radiumd     -It is My earnest hope that this action may prove a substantial step forward in the campaign against one of the most distressing maladies known to mankind.I have given My assent to a Bill effecting a consolidation of the law as to companies.A Bill has also been passed which, it is hoped, will assist the further development of the gas industry.I have been glad to welcome delegates from a number of maritime countries at a Conference on Safety of Life at Sea0Measures have, boon passed for the reform of Local Government in Scotland and for granting substantial relief from the burden of rates to agricultural, industrial and freight-transport lands and-heritages.
Provision has also &quot;been made to increase the available facilities for the supply of credit to the agricultural industry in Scotland.The Scottish Departments of Health, Agriculture, Prisons and other Departments have been re-organised in accordance  with the terms of the Re-organisation of Offices (Scotland) Act of last Session.In bidding you farewell,  I pray that the blessing of Almighty God may rest -qcpon your labours.
