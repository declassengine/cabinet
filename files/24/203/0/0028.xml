SECRET. Copy No.       24COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE.Extract from the Minutes of the 241s  Meeting, held on April 23, 1929.(1.)-CHEMICAL WARFARE POLICY.Ratification of Protocol for Prohibition of Use of Poisonous Gases (C.I.D. Papers Nos. 939-B, 940-B and 941-B.)(Previous References:  C.I.D. Minutes of the 226th Meeting, Minute 8; 234th Meeting, Minute 3; and 239th Meeting, Minute 14.)[This meeting of the Committee of Imperial Defence was summoned at very short notice; the High Commissioners of the Commonwealth of Australia, Union of South Africa and New Zealand were invited to attend, but, owing to the short notice given, it was only possible for representatives of the Commonwealth of Australia and New Zealand to be present.]THE COMMITTEE, at the request of the Cabinet, had under consideration a Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air, covering a Note by the Chief of the Air Staff on Chemical Warfare Policy (OLD. Paper No. 939-B), together with a Telegram from Lord Cushendun, asking for the instructions of His Majesty&apos;s Government (C.I.D. Paper No. 940-B).SIR AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN said that he had asked for a meeting of the Committee of Imperial Defence because the Cabinet, after considering the paper circulated by the Secretary of State for Air on the subject of Chemical Warfare Policy, had asked for the advice of the Committee. On the top of that, a telegram had been received from Lord Cushendun (C.I.D. Paper No. 940-B) saying that Chapter IV of the Draft Convention* relating to Chemical Warfare had unexpectedly come up for discussion at Geneva, and suggesting that his position would be made considerably stronger if he were empowered to announce the decision of His Majesty&apos;s Government to ratify the Protocol. Since then he had received the following further telegramt from Lord Cushendun : &quot;Preparatory Committee met in private session this afternoon to consider various amendments to Chapter IV (Chemical Warfare).After some discussion, it seems to have been more or less agreed to suppress paragraphs 3 and 4, and the only question that now remains is whether paragraphs 1 and 2 shall be retained with an amendment as to reciprocity, or whether the whole chapter shall be suppressed, the question being possibly dealt ..  with in a separate protocol.&quot;SIR AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN, continuing, said that paragraphs 1 and 2 referred to obligations which we had signed and not yet ratified, and in regard to which the meeting had been called. Paragraphs 3 and 4, however, which were apparently to be suppressed, were quite another matter. It was absolutely impossible for us to undertake to abstain in peace time from continuing our defensive preparations until all other Powers had agreed to do likewise. And even if other Powers did ratify the Protocol, we would scarcely be justified in entirely abandoning all our research and defensive preparations, since it was incumbent on us to be prepared for a breach of faith.  For these reasons he was of the opinion that* Printed as Appendix to C.I.D. Paper No. 940-13. t Subsequently circulated as O.I.D. P riper No. 941-B.Printed for the Committee of Imperial Defence.   April 1929.
paragraph 3 was quite inadmissible and that paragraph 4 was so vague and indeterminate as to make it impossible to enforce. Many of the substances used f the manufacture of poisonous gas were of everyday commercial use, and it would be extremely difficult to prove, not only the fact of importation, but also the motive6 The questions to be decided, therefore, were : &quot; Shall we ratify the Gas Protocol and shall we approve the first two clauses of Chapter IV of the Disarmament Pro gramme ? In that connection the Committee should know that the following countries had actually notified their ratification : Austria, Belgium, Egypt, Italy Liberia, France and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the two last-named with certain reservations,$ safeguarding themselves against gas attack by Powers which had not signed the Protocol or who might be guilty of a breach of faith. There was also reason to believe that Germany intended to notify her ratification at an early date.LORD SALISBURY stated that he was in entire agreement with the memorandum circulated by the Secretary of State for Air.Mr. AMERY, in reply to a question from the Prime Minister, said that the following answers had been received from the Commonwealth of Australia, New-Zealand and the Union of South Africa : &quot; Telearam from Prime Minister of the Commonwealth of Australia,No. 87 of April 23, 1929.With reference to your circular telegram A, No. 13,* His Majestv&apos;s Government in the Commonwealth of Australia are prepared to concur in the ratification of the Geneva Gas Protocol subject to reservations similar to those which the signatories have already made and subject also to any definite recommendation from the Committee of Imperial Defence against such action. The Commonwealth Government would, in latter case, desire to be acquainted with the ground(s) on which recommendation of the Committee of Imperial Defence is based.Telegram from the Governor-General of New Zealand, No. 45 of April 23, 1929.Your telegrams No. 401 of 22nd April and Circular A, No. 13* of 20th April, and Circular A, No. 16f of 22nd April. Subject to the reservation stated in Circular A, No. 13,* and in view of considerations and advantages set forth therein, His Majesty&apos;s Government in New Zealand are in favour of ratification of the Protocol.We are informing High Commissioner for New Zealand accordingly.Telegram from the Minister of External Affairs, Union of South Africa,No. 47 of April 23, 1929.Your secret telegrams, Circular A, Nos. 13* and 16t of 20th April and 22nd April.

Please advise Louw of the position taken up by us.&quot;Answers^: had not yet been received from Canada or the Irish Free State. But it was to be remembered that it had been the original intention that this question should not be discussed until the 2nd May, and therefore the Dominions had been asked to deal with this at unexpectedly short notice. Sir Granville Ryrie was present and might wish to elaborate the views of the Commonwealth. But Sir James Parr and Mr. Louw had unfortunately been unable to attend.SIR MAURICE HANKEY observed that a Military representative of New Zealand was present.SIR GRANVILLE RYRIE said that he had received a copy of the cable which Mr. Amery had just read out.  He had nothing to add to the views expressed therein.SIR SAMUEL HOARE stated that Sir Hugh Trenchard was extremely sorry that he was unable to be present, but that he had been prevented by a previous official engagement which it was impossible for him to cancel.I See Appendix &quot; B.&quot; * See Appendix &quot; B.&apos; t Not printed.X Eeplies subsequently received are printed as Appendices &quot; 0,&quot; &quot; 1) &quot; and &quot; E.&quot;
SIR LAMING WORTHINGTON-EVANS said that when the question of Chemical Warfare Policy had been before the Cabinet, he had particularly asked that it should go to the Committee of Imperial Defence before a final decision was taken, because the decision to hang back until it was known what other nations were going to do, had originated in advice given to the Government by their Military Advisers; and it was clearly desirable that no fresh decision should be taken on political grounds&quot; without hearing what the Military Advisers had to say about it. He had again discussed the question with the Chief of the Imperial General Staff. I If it were left to them, and if there were no political considerations at stake, they I would prefer to adhere to their previous expression of opinion and not to ratify the I Protocol, but the matter could not be looked at from the purely military point of I view alone.   It was essential to take into account political considerations.   In these I circumstances he was prepared to concur in ratification, and he had ventured to prepare a draft reply to Lord Cushendun as a basis of discussion, in order to focus I attention on  to  the  salient  points  at  issue and  to  shorten  the discussion. I (Copies   of   this   draft   were   circulated   to   the   Committee.)     Sir   Laming I Worthington-Evans,  continuing,  suggested that  Chapter IV was  unnecessary, I since all that we were prepared to agree to was included in the Protocol itself. Sir Austen ChamberlanTs remarks in regard to paragraphs 3 and 4 entirely coincided with his own views.  Paragraph 3 was most objectionable in that it would I be said that we had no right to make any defence or research preparations.   This might lead to a demand that the Gas School at Porton should be closed, and, in that event, the Army would not be prepared to defend itself against gas attack.   As regards paragraph 4, it was obviously impossible to place restrictions on the importa-tion of substances utilisable for chemical or bacteriological warfare, since these could be and were used commercially.   In fact, would it not be better to reject Chapter IV in totof   He noted that the recent telegram from Lord Cushendun was to the effect that it had been &quot;more or less &quot; agreed to suppress paragraphs 3 and 4.   That was not sufficient; we should insist on their absolute suppression. Unless we did that we should be continually being asked what we were doing. As the Committee were aware, the Soviet Government were doing much more gas preparation than ourselves, as were the United States, who had not even ratified the Protocol.SIR SAMUEL HO ARE agreed generally with the Secretary of State for War, but he thought that, as Chapter IV was bound to come up, it might put us in an invidious position if we opposed it in toto. He thought that we should, if necessary, agree to it, provided paragraphs 3 and 4 were taken out altogether. It was to be hoped that we would get considerable credit for ratifying, and it would be a pity if the credit were to be watered down by an unnecessarily obstinate attitude.LORD SALISBURY agreed generally with Sir Samuel Hoare. We ought not to allow ourselves to be put into a negative position if it could possibly be avoided.Mr. AMERY was anxious that no action should be taken by Lord Cushendun until replies had been received from Canada and the Irish Free State.There was considerable discussion as to whether the instructions to Lord Cushendun should or should not be sent until definite replies had been received from Canada and the Irish Free State. It was ultimately agreed that, in view of the fact that both Canada and the Irish Free State were almost certain to concur, instructions should be sent to Lord Cushendun forthwith, and that he should be informed at the same time that replies had not yet been received from Canada and the Irish Free State, but were expected momentarily; and that therefore he should, if possible, avoid making any announcement until their assent had been received.SIR MAURICE HANKEY pointed out that at the 217th meeting of the Committee of Imperial Defence, at which the Dominion Premiers were present, Mr. Mackenzie King himself had stated that, in his view, &quot; there was little value in self-denying ordinances unless we could insure that all parties would agree to the ordinance and would carry out their agreement. He thought that in no circum-stances ought we to deprive ourselves of the means of making use of gas should the necessity arise.&quot;SIR AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN enquired whether the concurrence of the Government of India had been received.F19195] r 2
LORD PEEL replied that he had not actually had a definite reply from the Government of India, but that he was quite sure that they would concur. He had discussed the question with his military advisers who expressed entire agreement with the War Office views. He recalled that India, under considerable pressure from the military authorities at Home, had recently started certain gas defence preparations.Conclusions.The Committee of Imperial Defence recommended (1.) That the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should telegraph* instruc-tions to Lord Cushendun on the lines of the discussion that had taken place to ratify the Geneva Gas Protocol, subject to certain reservations.(2 ) That the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs should communicate with Canada and the Irish Free State explaining the urgency of the question and asking them to expedite their replies.******2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1, April 23, 1929.* Copy of the telegram as despatched is attached as Appendix &quot; A.&quot;

His Majesty&apos;s Governments in Australia, New Zealand and South Africa have concurred. We have not yet received replies from Canada and Irish Free State, but expect them momentarily. It would be desirable that you should, if possible, avoid making announcement till their assent has been received, but if forced to deal with our objection to paragraphs 3 and 4 of Chapter IV, you may announce decision at once.&quot;(ii.)Telegram, from the Foreign Office to His Majesty&apos;s Consvl, Geneva, No. 41, datedApril 23, 1929.FOLLOWING for Lord Cushendun :-&quot; My immediately preceding telegram.His Majesty&apos;s Government have decided to ratify the Geneva Gas Protocol subject to following reservations : (a.) His Majesy&apos;s Government is bound by the Protocol only vis-a-vis those other States which have signed and ratified the Protocol or adhered thereto.(b.) His Majesty&apos;s Government ceases to be bound by the Protocol vis-a-vis any enemy State whose armed forces or whose allies do not respect the Protocol.You may announce this decision before entering on any discussion of Chapter IV of the Draft Convention.With regard to Draft Convention itself, His Majesty&apos;s Government consider inclusion of a special chapter on chemical warfare to be unnecessary in view of fact that the same matter is covered by the Gas Protocol. We have, however, no objection in principle to the first two paragraphs, and if other Powers wish them repeated here we willingly concur.As regards paragraphs 3 and 4.Your action is approved. If necessary, you may give the following as expressing the views of His Majesty&apos;s Government.Paragraph 3 does not in any way modify the definite pledge undertaken under first two paragraphs. On the other hand, it might open the door to objections being raised against defensive research and every nation must preserve the right of defence against non-signatories or transgressors of the Protocol.Paragraph 4 is incapable of enforcement certain gases, for example, phosgene and chlorine, have definite commercial uses and at the same time can be readily employed for war purposes. It is impossible to ensure that such gases, even if manufactured solely for commercial purposes, will not be made available as war gases; only safeguard would be reliance on good faith of producers. Inclusion of such illusory safeguard is valueless and can lead only to suspicion, especially of nations who manufacture such commercial gases on a large scale.&quot;
APPENDIXB.Paraphrase Telegram from the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs to the Secretary of State for External Affairs, Canada, the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth of Australia, the Governor-General of New Zealand, the Minister of External Affairs of the Union of South Africa and the Governor of Newfoundland.Important, Circular A, No. 13, Secret, 20th April, 1929.My secret despatch, Dominions, No. 90, of 4th February, 1927 : Geneva Gas Protocol. The question of ratification in respect of the United Kingdom has again been raised in view of the fact that several other countries have ratified, as to which Dominion Governments have been previously informed. It has been suggested that our continued abstention may be regarded as the more marked in the light of ratifica-tion by His Majesty of Treaty No. 2, signed at Washington on 6th February, 1922, which provided inter alia for prohibition of use of poisonous gases.Most of the Governments, including those of France and the Soviet Union, which have ratified the Geneva Gas Protocol to date have made reservations (1.) That they are bound thereby only vis-a-vis those other States which have signed and ratified or adhere.(2.) That they cease to be bound thereby vis-a-vis any enemy State whose armed forces or allies do not respect the Protocol.In favour of ratification it has been urged that (a.) Our own ratification with similar reservations would leave us free to continue any necessary preparation of measures against gas attack.(b.) So long as we do not ratify we give an enemy some excuse for using gas against us.(c.) It is unlikely that this country would initiate the use of gas in war.\d.) Any measure is to be supported which reduces the risk of gas attack from the air launched not primarily against troops who can be supplied with protective equipment and trained in anti-gas measures, but against the civil population of great towns. The dangers involved in such attack, it is argued, outweigh considerably any advantage to be secured by retaining freedom of action.It is proposed that the question should be considered at a meeting of Committee of Imperial Defence on 2nd May, and it would be of great help to the Committee if the views of His Majesty&apos;s Governments in the Dominions on the foregoing suggestions and the considerations adduced in support could be made available to them at their discussion on that date.Telegram from the Secretary of State for External Affairs, Canada, to the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.Dated 23rd April, 1929.(Received 11-50 p.m. 23rd April, 1929.)State, No. 71, Confidential.

H.March 25, 1929.[19162]
Enclosure to Appendix. Note by the Chief of the Air Staff.Secretary of State,1. I think that the question of the ratification of this Protocol by His Majesty&apos;s Government should be further considered. When the question was last considered by the Committee of Imperial Defence and by the Cabinet in 1926, it was&quot; decided to defer ratification for the reasons (a) that very few other countries had ratified they being France, Venezuela and Liberia; and (&amp;) that the General Staff considered that the question of the inhumanity of gas as compared with other methods of warfare merited further consideration.2. The position has now been considerably changed as regards (a). In the last few months Soviet Russia, Italy, Austria, Belgium, Egypt and Poland have ratified the Protocol. If we continue to withhold ratification, we lay ourselves open to the reproach, however unjustifiable in fact, tha,t we are refusing to ban the use of poisonous gases. We signed and ratified Washington Treaty No. 2 of the 6th February, 1922, Article V of which prohibited the use of &quot; asphyxiating, poisonous and other gases,&quot; &amp;c, &amp;c. That Treaty did not come into force because France, for other reasons (i.e., objection to the articles of the Treaty dealing with submarine warfare), did not ratify it, but our own ratification of that Treaty makes more marked our continued abstention from ratification of the Geneva Protocol.3.   As regards the doubts expressed by the War Office, I would point out (i.) That most of the Governments which have ratified, including France and Russia, have done so subject to the following reservations : (a.) The Government is only bound by the Protocol vis-a-vis those other States which have signed and ratified the Protocol or adhered thereto;(&amp;.) The Government ceasea to be bound by the Protocol vis-a-vis any enemy State whose armed forces or whose allies do not respect the Protocol.(ii.) Our own ratification, with these reservations, leaves us free to continue any necessary preparation of defensive and offensive measures against gas attack.(iii.) So long as we do not ratify we give an enemy some excuse for using gas against us.(iv.) Whatever the comparative inhumanity of gas, as compared with other methods of warfare, it is unlikely that this country would initiate the use of gas in war.(v.) Lastly and chiefly, from the air point of view, any measure is to be supported which reduces the risk of gas attack from the air launched not primarily against troops who can be trained in anti-gas measures and supplied with protective equipment, but against the civil population of our great towns. The consequent risk of dislocation of vital services and of collapse of moral would, I believe, far outweigh any possible advantage to ourselves in other directions which might be secured by retaining freedom of action.: H. TRENCHARD,Chief of the Air Staff.March 25, 1929.

Having only yesterday made promulgation of our general policy, it was evidently difficult to-day to go very far in criticism.&quot; First two paragraphs of chapter 4 were adopted subject to the possibility of inserting something to show that they are limited to reciprocal operation as between parties only. Text to give effect to this will be submitted later. I saw no reason to comment on either of these paragraphs. They do not go beyond Geneva gas protocol, which we have signed though not ratified. (I had under-stood that question of ratification was to be re-examined immediately. If this has not been done, I should be glad if it could be done soon. If we could decide on ratification it would be of great value if I could make declaration to that effect here, similar to that made on behalf of four or five Governments this morning.)&quot; in regard to paragraphs 3 and 4, I pointed out that wording was unsatis-factory, and that it would not be clear to what signatories would be binding themselves. German delegate explained that it was necessary to have some prohibition of preparation for chemical warfare, i.e., manufacture of implements for the discharge of gas, flame-throwers, gas bombs and shells, and training men in their use. French delegate pointed out that under first two paragraphs signatories would give pledge not to employ methods of chemical warfare, and under third and fourth paragraphs would bind themselves not to break that pledge, which seemed rather superfluous.&apos;&apos; German delegate moved additional paragraph forbidding discharge from air of all chemical or bacteriological substances. He will submit definite text. Soviet delegate observed that, if chapter 4 were cut down so as to amount to no more than gas protocol, what was the point of it ? It would merely give Govern-ments pretext for delaying ratification of that protocol. It would be better merely to pass resolution urging Governments to ratify.&apos; As so many various amendments have been proposed, the President asked delegates to submit them in writing to-night, and they will be considered on Monday morning.* Reproduced as an Appendix to this paper.[19179]Copy No.       Si
