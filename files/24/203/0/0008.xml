I This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.] Printed for the Cabinet.   April 1929.SECRET. Copy No.     %CP. 108 (29).CABINET.POSITION OP THE HIGH COMMISSIONER FOR THE UNION OF SOUTH AFRICA IN LONDON.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.WITH reference to my memorandum on the above subject, circulated as CP. 387 (28), my colleagues will already have seen, among the Dominions Office telegrams circulated to the Cabinet, copies of two telegrams sent to the Imperial Secretary in South Africa on the 4th January as a result of Cabinet Meeting 58 (28), Item 7, and of an interim reply from the Imperial Secretary, dated the.26th January. Copies of these telegrams are annexed for convenience of reference (Appendices &quot;A,&quot; &quot;B &quot; and&quot; C &quot;).I now circulate a copy of a despatch from the Imperial Secretary, dated the 1st March (Appendix &quot; D &quot;), from which it will be seen that General Hertzog, subject to the agreement of his Cabinet, has, for the time being at any rate, accepted the arguments advanced in favour of the retention of the existing title of the High Commissioner in London, and has expressed himself as content to rely upon the, &quot; Gazette &quot; Notice and Letter of Appointment &quot; to emphasize the plenary powers and the political functions entrusted to the High Commissioner.&quot;In this connexion, I annex a copy of a notice in the Union of South Africa &quot; Official Gazette &quot; for the 1st March, regarding the appointment of Mr. Louw as High Commissioner for the Union in London (Appendix &quot; E &quot;). together with a copy of the letter presented to me by Mr. Louw on taking up his duties in London (Appendix &quot; F &quot;).I would further draw the attention of my colleagues to the statements attributed to Mr. Smit, the retiring High Commissioner, in the &quot;Cape Times &quot; report of the 28th January (enclosed in the Imperial Secretary&apos;s despatch of the 1st March), in explanation of the reasons why representatives of the Dominions in London could never be &quot; diplomatists in the ordinary sense.&quot;L. S. A.Dominions Office, Downing Street, April 10, 1929.APPENDIX &quot;A.&quot;Telegram from the Undersecretary of State for Dominion Affairs to the ImperialSecretary, South Africa.(Sent 5-45 p.m. 4th January, 1929.)No. 1, Confidential.Your telegram 17th November, No. 101.   Question raised by General Hertzog as to making some addition to title of next High Commissioner for Union of South Africa in London has now been before the Cabinet.   View of Cabinet was that [19114] b
existing title appears fully to carry out intentions of Union Government as regards status of their representative in London as set out in your telegram No. 98, and that any addition to that title is strongly to be deprecated. Title &quot; High Commis-sioner &quot; is; indeed, the highest one used in inter-Imperial relations and one of such high dignity and importance that, in the view of the Cabinet, it fully indicates status contemplated without any addition. No other Dominion has made any suggestion for addition to existing title of its &quot;High Commissioner in London, and title &quot; High Commissioner &apos;&apos; has been adopted by Government here as the designation of its repre-sentative in Canada corresponding to Union High Commissioner in London. Term &quot; High Commissioner &quot; has equally important significance in so far as it is employed in international usage, and it is noteworthy that, in the course of negotiations with Egypt in 1927, then Egyptian Prime Minister asked that status of British repre-sentative in Egypt might be altered from that of High Commissioner to that of Ambassador on the ground that the former implied a higher degree of authority than the latter. Further, during the War &quot;High Commissioner&quot; was the highest title conferred on any representative of Great Britain abroad.Please bring these considerations to General Hertzog&apos;s notice, and use every effort to induce him to withdraw suggestion for any addition to the title.APPENDIX &quot; B.&apos;Telegram from the Under Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs to the ImperialSecretary, South Africa.(Sent 8-15 p.m. 4th January, 1929.) No. 2, Confidential.   My telegram of to-day, No. 1.Mr. Amery has informed Smit of view taken by Cabinet. Smit reiterated opinion that it was desirable that word &quot; diplomatic &quot; should be associated in some way with High Commissioner^ title. His reason apparently was that use of this term would indicate that appointment was of a permanent character and that High Commissioner would not be liable to change with a change of Government in the Union. Secretary of State explained that use of word &quot;diplomatic&quot; was not necessary to secure this. (Indeed, it may be observed that its use would not necessarily have any such effect, e.g., the diplomatic representatives of the United States are frequently changed on a change of Government.) But Mr. Amery intimated that he felt sure that it would be entirely in accordance with views held here if, in the defining resolution of the Executive Council of the Union, and in the letter of appointment to the High Commissioner, it were made absolutely clear that he was in the fullest sense a representative of his Government and that his appoint-ment was either for a term of years or, at any rate, not liable to be terminated should a Government of a different complexion come into power. Smit also observed that Dominion High Commissioners sometimes experience difficulties when visiting Geneva or foreign capitals in that the term &quot; High Commissioner &quot; did not convey to foreign Governments adequate idea of their status and that, in consequence. High Commissioners find themselves sometimes debarred from privileges and courtesies accorded to diplomatic representatives. Mr. Amery promised to consult with the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs on this point, but he now understands that Smit, as the representative of the Union at Geneva, is, in fact, on the same footing when there in the matter of privileges and courtesies as the representatives of all other Governments attending meetings of the League.
APPENDIX &quot; C.&quot;Telegram from the Imperial Secretary, South A fried, to the Under-Secretary of Statefor Dominion Affairs.(Received 11-31 a.m. 26th January, 1929.)No. 20, 26th January. Your telegrams 4th January, Nos. 1 and 2: High Commissioners Title. Raised this question with the Prime Minister, who expressed the wish to leave decision in abeyance owing to other urgent matters. He promised to consult me again before taking further action. He may subsequently overlook above undertaking, and in that event obliged if you will notify me or remind Prime Minister of his promise. Imperial Secretary.APPENDIX &quot;D.&quot;(No. 37.   Confidential.) High Commissioner&apos;s Of/ice,Sir, &apos; Cape Town, March 1, 1929.I CALLED on Dr. Bodenstein and drew his attention to the Press report of Mr. Smifs views on the question of the proposed additions to the title of the Union High Commissioner in London, and enquired whether they reflected the opinion of the Union Government, suggesting that, if they did, there was no further need for me to discuss the matter with the Prime Minister. Dr. Bodenstein replied that Mr. Smifs interview must be considered to be an expression of his personal opinion not strictly in harmony with Union policy. I explained that I was awaiting an opportunity to discuss the matter with the Prime Minister at his convenience, and was subsequently informed that General Hertzog did not wish to pursue the question any further until he had had an opportunity of consulting Mr. Smit on the latter&apos;s arrival in South Africa.2. I saw Mr. Smit later on and learned from him that he had discussed the matter with the Prime Minister and had concluded that General Hertzog would not go further into the matter for the present.3. This morning, however, the Prime Minister reverted to this question, and I acquainted him with the views of His Majesty&apos;s Government as conveyed in your telegram No. 1 of the 4th January, supplementing them by instancing the prestige of the High Commissioner in South Africa in relation to the Governors of the British South African Colonies arid the custom of conferring this title on officers occupying positions of exceptional responsibility in other parts of the world. I added that, when the Dominions complained that a much higher status should be given to their Agents-General, His Majesty&apos;s Government in Great Britain had responded by giving them the title of High Commissioner, which denoted an exceptional measure of prestige. I concluded by saying that the title was well understood and its importance appreciated by foreign countries, and stressed the value of retaining it for the above reasons and because it was adopted in other Dominions and provided a uniform title for the persons deputed to discharge inter-Dominion representation throughout the Empire.4.   General Hertzog admitted that, from the point of view of His Majesty&apos;s Government in Great Britain, the undoubted prestige of the title could not be assailed.   He explained, however, that in the Union it was associated with Trade representation, and reminded me that when the Act establishing the post of High Commissioner had been brought in shortly after Union, he and Mr. Merriman and several others had deprecated the large sum of money voted for this post on the rounds that the occupant was merely a glorified Trade Commissioner.   From the outh African point of view, therefore, I would see that the title of High Commis-sioner as applied to Union officials had an insignificant genesis incompatible with the present-day importance of the post, and was reminiscent of days when the Dominions were in a subordinate constitutional position.   He admitted, however, [19114] b 2
that the arguments put forward by His Majesty&apos;s Government in Great Britain exhibited the title in a much better light, and he was less inclined as a consequence to press for a change.5. I pointed out that the important consideration was to secure the prestige of the High Commissioner in London and on the Continent where he had to exercise his functions, and expressed the view that even in South Africa the former less important aspect of the title was rapidly being obscured by the new and greatly enhanced prestige associated with the post.6. After further discussion, General Hertzog said he would be content to rely on the &apos;&apos; Gazette &apos;&apos; Notice and letter of appointment to emphasise the plenary powers and the political functions entrusted to the High Commissioner, and would ask the Cabinet to accept the title as adequate.I have, &amp;c.

Smit.(From our Correspondent.)London, Saturday.Mr. J. S. SMIT, the Union High Commissioner, accorded me an interview on the eve of his departure from England, after his four years&apos; office, for the purpose of discussing the relations between Britain and the Dominions.The present position, Mr. Smit says, is governed by the resolutions passed at the last Imperial Conference, and he expressed his conviction that the new status of the Dominions, confirmed at that Conference, had worked out very well in practice.Revolution in the Work.It had already brought about a revolution in the actual work of the High Commissioner, for, instead of being, as formerly, more or less the head of a trading organisation, he was now compelled to undertake important diplomatic duties.For instance, the Union Government used him more and more as the channel for communicating with the British Government, while, at the same time, the British Government consulted him on matters affecting South Africa. Thus the tendency of the High Commissioner was to become a diplomatist rather than a Trade Commissioner.For two reasons, however, representatives of the Dominions in London could never be diplomatists in the ordinary sense. Firstly, it would be absurd for the King to have Ambassadors at his own Court. Secondly, the relations of Great Britain with the Dominions could never be the same as those between Great Britain and foreign countries, and would, therefore, be outside the nature of ordinary diplomatic transactions.Important Problem.Mr. Smit repeated his conviction that the new status was working well, but he thought one important thing still remained to be done, namely, to define the precise way in which Dominion representatives in London were to have access to the Sovereign, who, of course, was as much King of the Union of South Africa as of Great Britain. No doubt, however, in time a satisfactory solution of this somewhat difficult problem would be reached.With the growing importance of the High Commissioner, Mr. Smit thought the appointment should no longer be merely a party one; it should be independent of the vicissitudes of party politics. The mere fixation of a time limit would not, however, solve this question.

The mere fixation of a time limit would not, however, solve this question.
Public Opinion.What was wanted was realisation by the various Dominions of the importance of the High Commissioners office under the new status, which, in time, would make him as immune from party politics as, say, Great Britain&apos;s Ambassadors and Ministers in foreign countries.Mr. Smit, in conclusion, expressed his sincere appreciation of the help he had received from members of the British Government during his stay here and their readiness to help him in his task, which had thus been made comparatively easy.He also spoke, in terms of high praise, of his colleagues of the other Dominions and of the great value of the conferences which the various High Commissioners of the Dominions had been holding regularly among themselves in London.APPENDIX  &apos;:E.&quot;Union of South Africa &quot; Official Gazette,&quot; March 1, 1929.(No. 402.) March 1, 1929.IT is hereby notified that his Excellency the Governor-General, under the powers in him vested by section one of the High Commissioner^ Act, 1911 (Act No. 3 of 1911) has been pleased to appoint Eric Louw, Esquire, as High Commissioner for the Union of South Africa in the United Kingdom, with effect from the 1st March, 1929, vice Jacobus Stephanus Smit, Esquire, who relinquishes the appointment.APPENDIX &quot; F.&quot;Department of External Affairs, Sir, Cape Town, February 7, 1929.THE bearer of this letter, Mr. E. Louw, B.A., LL.B., has been appointed by His Majesty&apos;s Government in the Union as High Commissioner for the Union of South Africa in Great Britain and Northern Ireland for a period of one year as from the 1st March, 1929&quot;His Majesty&apos;s Government in the Union have, therefore, the honour to request His Majesty&apos;s Government in Great Britain and Northern Ireland to give entire credence to all that Mr. Louw shall communicate to them on the part of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the Union, and to extend to him the same favours, facilities and courtesies as have been enjoyed by his predecessors.I have, &amp;c.
