; Tfcf a. Docnment is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.&quot;!      n ,---------------------------------    2oPrinted for the Cabinet.   April 1929.SECRET. Copy No.    28CP. 127 (29).CABINET.FRENCH DEBT TO AMERICA FOR WAR STOCKS.Memorandum by the Treasury.(Circulated by Direction of the Chancellor of the Exchequer with reference to cabinet 18 (29), Conclusion 1.)1.   THE French War Debt to the United States Government includes (a) The debt for supplies during the continuance of the War,  720 millions;(b) The debt for surplus War stocks handed over to the French government after the War,  80 millions.The Agreement for funding the French Debt to America, which was signed in 1926, but has not yet been ratified, covers both portions of the Debt. But the Debt of  80 millions for war stocks is due for repayment on the 1st August, 1929, and, if the Funding Agreement is not ratified before that date, France will be under the obligation of making an immediate payment (in dollars) of  80 millions to the United States Government. The interest on this particular Debt has always been paid in cash, and accordingly France could not refuse to -repay the Debt on its due date without being confessedly in default.2. M. Poincare has made it clear that he sees at present no prospect of obtaining the ratification of the War Debt Agreements with America and with Great Britain unless there has been a final settlement of German reparations. If, therefore, the Experts&apos; Conference now sitting in Paris should not achieve a settlement, it is possible that the Agreement for funding the French War Debt to America may not be ratified, and that the payment of  80 millions for war stocks may have to be made on the 1st August next.3. If there is any possibility of this  80 millions being paid by France to the United States of America, the question arises whether His Majesty&apos;s Government should put forward a claim that a proportionate payment (say,  60 millions) should be made to this country in accordance with the pari passu principle. This principle is one which His Majesty&apos;s Government have always regarded as fundamental. On the 10th December, 1924, the Chancellor of the Exchequer stated in the House of Commons as follows : We consider it essential that any payments made by our debtors in Europe to their creditors in the United States should be accompanied simultaneously part passu by proportionate payments to Great Britain.&quot;Moreover, the French Government were notified on several occasions of our views on this point, including a formal letter from the Foreign Secretary to the French Ambassador of the 27th July, 1925, in which he reiterated &apos;&apos; (1) That in the event of any payments being made by the French Govern-ment to the United States of America, His Majesty&apos;s Government expect payments not less in amount, due regard being had to the proportion of the amounts of the Debts in each case, to be made simultaneously to this country; and(2) That, while the settlements in each case must be substantially equal in value, they need not be necessarily identical in form.&quot;[19217]
Subsequently, the principle was stated in somewhat different terms. In the Press Communique issued on the 26th August, 1925, only war debts were referred to : &quot;His Majesty&apos;s Government have from the outset made it perfectly clear that any arrangements which they can come to with France must be governed by the principle so often declared that they must receive from France proportionate and pari passu payments to any she may eventually make to the United States &quot; in the settlement of her war debt.&quot;But in communications addressed to the French Government, the principle was stated in quite general terms: e.g., the Chancellor wrote to M. Peret on the 18th May, 1926 : &quot; I had agreed with M. Caillaux that, in the event of France making an arrangement more favourable to the United States than that which we had agreed together, the British Government should be entitled to press for a proportionate augmentation of the  12^ millions standard annuities. As we do not consider that the Franco-American debt proposals now awaiting ratification are substantially more favourable to the United States than those which I had agreed with M. Caillaux, this point does not arise.&quot;Similarly, he wrote to M. Caillaux on the 1st July, 1926 : :&apos; There was the understanding that no settlement would be made by France with the United States more favourable to the United States than that which you were discussing with me. That also is satisfactorily settled.&quot;Taking these statements as a whole, therefore, the French Government can scarcely argue that we are making a. novel and unexpected demand upon them if we claim a proportionate payment to any that they make to America in respect of the Stocks debt.4. It must, however, be recognised that such a claim may provoke considerable resentment in France and possibly also in the United States. The French Govern-ment have always regarded their so-called &quot; commercial &quot; War Debts as quite different from their &quot; political &quot; War Debts. They will, no doubt, argue that their &quot;commercial&quot; War Debts to this country, namely, the debt of  72 millions from the Bank of France to the Bank of England (which, in fact, was not an inter-Governmental Debt at all), and the debt of  6 millions for surplus stores to the Ministry of Munitions, have already been repaid in full, and that it is, therefore, unjustifiable for His Majesty&apos;s Government to found any claim on the repayment at its due date of the similar &quot; commercial &quot; War Debt to America. Thus, the argument against putting forward a claim is that it seems improbable that we shall be able to enforce payment of the  60 millions claimed as due to us, and, accordingly, that it would be unwise to make a claim which may cause resentment and is unlikely to be conceded.5. On the other hand, there are weighty reasons in favour of putting forward a. claim. His Majesty&apos;s Government have never accepted the distinction which the French Government have sought to make between &quot;political&quot; and &quot;commercial&apos;&quot; War Debts, and in our view, this distinction is a mere quibble. The War Debt to America for stocks is a part of the total volume of Governmental obligations arising out of the War, and there is no logical reason for treating it as more binding than other inter-Governmental War Debts. The sole difference between the Debt for stocks and the rest of the War Debt is that the Debt for stocks represents the value of the surplus War material shipped to France for the American Armies and handed over to the French Government after the war, when the United States Government were anxious to dispose of it, while the rest of the War Debt represents the value of War material supplied during the war to the French Armies, when it was a vital necessity. The United States Government formally recognised the identical character of the two Debts by agreeing to include the Debt for war stocks with the rest of the War Debt and funding them both together.6. This being the position, His Majesty Government might well be said to have abandoned the pari &quot;passu principle if they allowed France to pay  80 millions to America without making a proportionate payment to us.It was easy to show in the recent Budget Debate that the funding agreements made by America with her debtors were not much more favourable, all things considered, than the funding agreements made by this country with our debtors. But if tht French Government paid to America this year, not the comparatively small annuity of  7 millions prescribed in the Funding Agreement of 1926, but an out and out capital sum of  80 millions without making any corresponding payment to this country, criticism would be difficult to rebut.
7. There is another quite different but very important consideration in favour I of making the claim. The French Government are believed to hold sterling balances I amounting to some  60 millions, accumulated out of the surplus reparation receipts I they have obtained, over and above their payments for debts, during the past four ) years. On the other hand, they are understood to have comparatively few dollars, ! and if they had to repay the  80 millions due to America, they might have to transfer their sterling balances in London to America at very short notice and thus cause a, most embarrassing strain on the sterling-dollar exchange.It is known that (in addition to the sterling balances held by the French Government) the Bank of France owns very large sums both of sterling and of dollars, and there is every reason to think that the French Government could obtain dollars from the Bank of France with which to repay the  80 millions to America without transferring any funds from London. If this is so, it would be a most unfriendly as well as a very embarrassing act if the French Government were to sell their sterling balances hastily for this purpose. The Bank of England, however, has reason to believe that there is a possibility of this; and it may be that if the Stocks debt has to be repaid, some French politicians would not be loath to cause the maximum possible disturbance to the sterling exchange, as a demonstration of the economic danger of inter-Allied debt payments. In the interests of our commercial credit, we cannot take the line that the French Government are not entitled to transfer their sterling balances when necessary, and, if we are to prevent such action, -we must find other means of obviating it.8. It is understood that the French Treasury would be willing to give an assurance that if they have to make their payment to America they would consult us with a view to causing the minimum possible disturbance to the sterling-dollar exchange, but they would give such an assurance only on condition that we agreed not to put forward any claim for a pari passu payment to this country. This, however besides being a somewhat humiliating arrangement for us to enter into -would involve giving up our legitimate financial claim to  60 millions in return for an assurance of a vague and temporary character, which would leave us open to similar threats in future whenever there was any controversy between us and the French Government;, while, if a payment of  60 millions were made simultaneously to this country, we should both obtain satisfaction of our financial claim and avoid the danger of sterling being transferred to America.9. It may be asked what answer we should have if the French Government not only refused to admit our claim, but proceeded to selling their sterling balances for dollars without regard to the damage done to our exchange. In that event, we should be forced to use our ultimate weapon viz., the French Treasury Bills for  720 millions now in our possession. Blocks of these bills mature every month, and though, hitherto, they have, always been automatically renewed, we have never undertaken to renew them indefinitely, and so long as the Debt Agreement has not been ratified by France, we are entitled to let the bills run off and to present them for payment as they mature. The amounts maturing during the next few months are as follows :  1st May      ... ... ...      10,085,7001st June     ... ... ... ...      72,978,6001st Julv      ... ... ... ...      24,451,0001st August ... ... ... ...      28,827.800The Bills due on the 1st May are being renewed under existing arrangements (i-e., for a year); but the maturities clue on the 1st June and the 1st July might well be renewed only up to the 1st August, so that there should be a substantial block falling due, like the American debt, on that date. The French Government attach much importance to small points of legality such as this, and M. Poincare has just reaffirmed that, &quot; as debtors, we have always been faithful to our engagements, and we have so little thought of repudiating them that up to now we have regularly met all the foreign maturities (&apos; echeances&apos;) that have been fixed.&apos;5Thus, the French Government could not repudiate their Treasury Bills due for payment, and they would be bound to settle with us in order to avoid such a contingency.10. If it is decided to assert our claim, a convenient opportunity to do so exists. No definite arrangement has as yet been concluded as regards the French debt payment this year. M. Cheron, the French Minister of Finance, on the 13th April wrote to the Chancellor of the Exchequer a letter stating that the French
Government &apos;&apos; were disposed to pay &apos;&apos; during the financial year 1929 the sum of  10 millions in respect of the French War Debts to Great Britain in continuation of the provisional payments alreadv effected on the scale laid down by the Agreement of the 12th July, 1926. It was explained that this letter was not a firm engagement to pay, but amoffer to renew the provisional arrangement hitherto in force, and that the French Government hoped that we would enter into a binding arrangement for the year. If this offer were accepted without any reservation, His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment would be precluded from claiming anything more during the next year than the  10 million annuity prescribed in the Agreement. It is not considered that we should bind ourselves&apos; in this way, and it is suggested that we should, in acknowledging receipt of this letter, say that &quot; His Majesty&apos;s Government would be willing to accept this continuation of the provisional arrangement hitherto in force, provided that the payments by France to the United States Government continue similarly on the scale&apos;provided for in the Berenger Agreement. But, if the French Government make any capital payments to the Government of the United States in respect of any of the obligations covered by that Agreement, His Majesty;s Govern-ment will be bound to claim a proportionate capital payment in respect of the obligations due to this country.&quot;11. It is considered that a reservation of this kind is most necessary. It is not very likely that it will result in obtaining a payment of  60 millions. But it is likely that it will furnish the French Government with a strong additional induce-ment to press upon their Parliament the ratification of the War Debt Agreements with both this country and America, and thereby prevent both the payment of  80 millions to America in August next and the adverse effects that such a payment might have upon our exchange.Treasury Chambers, SJV. 1, April 29, 1929.o
