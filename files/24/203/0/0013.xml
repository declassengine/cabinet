SHIS gOggMKBjg IjS THE PROPERTY OF HIS MAJESTY1 S GOVERNMENT,.CAB I li E 1 -REPORT OP THE IKTER-DEPARTMENTAL COMMITTEE ON UNEMPLOYMENT,(CP.104 (29))copy hortr.JliX113(29 J. IT PTE BY THE Mill I ST ER OP LABOUR.1.      I would suggest to my colleagues that it is the duty of the Government of the day to provide the country with an official and impartial report on such proposals as those which have recently teen made in the pamphlet &quot;We can conquer Unemployment&quot;.      We have, as yet,  done nothing of the kind, in the case of these propio^als, but have confined ourselves to attacking them on the platform and in parliament. 2.     The Report of the Inter-Departmental Committee on Unemployment (CP*104(29)J provides a wealth of material for an unbiassed analysis, but the Report itself is not, of course, in a form suitable for publication.     And,  even if it were, there are obvious objections to the publication of a document prepared for Cabinet use and containing, as Sir Warren Pisher says, &quot;the views and experience of the various officials who would have the actual business of giving effect to the proposals&quot;.      But I see no reason why the Cabinet should not take responsibility for a memorandum which would be based on the material contained in the Repiort and might be issued as a White Paper.3*      I suggest, therefore, that a small Committee of the Cabinet should be appointed at once to prepare, on the basis of the material contained in CP, 104 (29), a memorandum for approval by the Cabinet.(intd. ) A.S-M.Ministry of labour. 16th April, 1929.
