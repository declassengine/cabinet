Printed for the Cabinet.  April 1929.SECRET. - Copy No.    2 8CP. 109 (29).CABINET.IRISH MIGRATION.Memorandum by the Secretary of State eor Dominion Affairs.IN pursuance of the Cabinet decision of the 6th March (Cabinet 10 (29), Conclusion 7), I have given further consideration to the question of the possible deportation of persons of Irish Free State origin who have become a charge on public funds in this country.The question was raised in the Cabinet whether legislation to provide for the deportation of Irishmen would not be contrary to the Articles of Agreement. I am advised that, so far as the Articles of Agreement are concerned, there would be no objection to such legislation on the understanding that it would be general in form, that is, would apply to all British subjects who have entered Great Britain from other parts of the Empire within (say) a limited number of years and not merely to those who entered from the Irish Free State.I feel bound to say, however, that I should view with some concern any legislation which would violate the existing principle whereby all British subjects of whatever origin are free to enter and reside in the United Kingdom. Further, I doubt whether, in view of the memorandum by the Home Secretary (CP. 45 (29) ), any sufficient case for such legislation is made out. I am, of course, aware that the other Dominions (excepting the Irish Free State) have taken and freely exercise powers to exclude or admit British subjects; on the other hand, the adoption by the United Kingdom of a similar attitude in this respect would admittedly involve a very important change from traditional policy.I should not, however, regard agreed legislation for the mutual repatriation, as between the Irish Free State and the United Kingdom, of persons who have become a public charge, under conditions such as before the creation of the Irish Free State would have permitted the transfer of such persons from Great Britain to Ireland, as a violation of the principle referred to in the preceding paragraph. As my colleagues are aware, proposals for legislation on these lines have already been submitted to the Irish Free State Government, and it is understood that a Committee appointed by that Government has them at present under consideration. - I shall, of course, take such steps as are possible to expedite the Free State reply to our proposals.L. S. A.Dominions Office, April 10, 1929.[19113]
