Printed for the Cabinet.   April 1929.SECRET.Copy No.CP. 116 (29).CABINET.CIVIL SERVICE :   REMUNERATION OF  &quot; P&quot;   CLASS  CLERKS  and temporary MALE CLERKS.THE Guinness Agreement with the Association of ex-Service Civil Servants, dated the 12th January, 1925, provided, inter alia, for the selection of a certain number of ex-service temporary clerks for permanent non-pensionable employment in Government Departments, and for the payment of these clerks (now known as &quot;P &quot; Class Clerks) at the same rates of remuneration as those from time to time in force for temporary male clerks. These &quot;P&quot; Class Clerks at present number approximately 7,300, and there are, in addition, approximately 850 ex-service clerks in War Office Out-Stations establishments (known as &quot; P.U.&quot; Clerks) to whom this provision of the Guinness Agreement has, in principle, been extended. Temporary male clerks (including some 2,000 clerks employed in War Office and Air Ministry Out-Station Establishments) at present number approximately 10,700.&quot;P &quot; Class Clerks and temporary male clerks are divided into three grades (I, II and III). There are approximately 300 clerks in Grade I and 1,500 in Grade II; all the rest are in the lowest Grade (Grade III).The pay of these Grades is revised twice a year on the basis of the average cost of living figure for the previous six months. At the present time the maximum rates payable on the scale approved for Grade III Clerks employed on the basis of a. 42-hour week in the London area, are as follows : Slightly higher rates are prescribed for men employed on the basis of a 44-hour week, and lower rates for men employed in the provinces. E.g., the maximum of the Grade III scale for men working a 44-hour week is, in certain large provincial centres, 64s. Qd. (rising from a minimum of 54s. Qd.), and in smaller provincial centres, 61s. 5d. (rising from a minimum of 51s. 5d.).Claims have now been submitted by the Association of ex-service ;Civil Servants on the one hand, and by the Civil Service Confederation on the other, for a substantial increase in the remuneration payable to &quot; P &quot; Class (and by analogy to &quot; P.U.&quot;) Clerks employed throughout, the country. It is estimated that the ultimate extra cost of agreeing to the increases recommended by these two Associations would amount respectively to  636,000 and  443,000 per annum.It is part of the case presented that the &quot; P &quot; Class is an enduring class and that temporary rates are designed for temporary employment during an emergency and do not provide an adequate basis for the remuneration of permanent employees. This particular argument, however, is purely theoretical;  it might, indeed, be moreMemorandum by the Treasury.[Circulated by Direction of the Chancellor of the Exchequer.&apos;]Grade I Grade II Grade III102s. 9d. 80s.   2d.63s. Ud. (rising   to    this   figure.after four years&apos; service, from a minimum of 53s. 11^.).[19161]
convincingly argued that the permanent clerk, who is not exposed to the risk of unemployment, would appropriately be paid not more but less than a temporary clerk on the same work who is liable to discharge at any time. The plain fact is that the &quot;P&quot; Class Clerk is employed on the same kind of work as the temporary ex-service clerk; he is certainly no better qualified than the temporary ex-service clerk to carry out this work; and in such circumstances it would be impossible to find any satisfactory defence for an arrangement which denied to temporary ex-service clerks the benefits of any pay concession made to their &quot;P &apos;&apos; Class colleagues. If then the claims now presented by the Association of ex-service Civil Servants and by the Civil Service Confederation were to be admitted it would inevitably be on the basis of conceding equally good terms to the temporary ex-service clerks; and on this basis the ultimate extra cost involved in acceptance of the two claims respectively would amount to no less than  1,758,000 per annum and  1,260,000 per annum.In support of these claims the Associations argue that &quot;P &quot; Class Clerks are employed on duties appropriate to the established clerical class, which in London is on a scale rising to a maximum of  250 per annum, plus bonus. If this -were the only argument behind the claims there w-ould have been no difficulty in deciding against them, for, in fact, the duties of &quot; P &quot; Class Clerks (and of temporary ex-service clerks) are markedly inferior to those of the established clerical class and akin to the duties appropriate to the lower class of women writing assistants.There is this further argument against accejDtance of the claims now submitted, that the pay nowr prescribed for temporary ex-service clerks was settled by the Arbitration Board so recently as July 1927. The duties assigned to these clerks are no more responsible now than they were then, and the pay assigned to them is lower to-day than at the date of the Arbitration Board&apos;s award merely because the index figure of the cost of living has been falling since that time.But there are important arguments in favour of a considerable improvement in the present standard of remuneration of &quot; P &quot; Class and temporary ex-service clerks.A. These men are now for the most part receiving a maximum wage of approximately  3 a week. This is, no doubt, as much as many clerks outside the Government Service are receiving. But the Government is pledged to the principle that it will follow good outside practice, and there is no doubt that a higher rate of remuneration than  3 a week could be defended on any such comparison.B. The present rates compare unfavourably, when due allowance is made for the recognised difference between mems and women&apos;s rates, with the scales now prescribed for women writing assistants in the Civil Service.C. The present rates compare unfavourably with the rates paid by the Post Office to their manipulative grades. A sorter, for example, goes to a maximum, inclusive of bonus, of 102s. Qd. a week.D. It can plausibly be represented that a maximum wage of  3 a week for ex-service clerks who are on the average nearer 40 than 30 years of age, and who, for the most part, are married, is hardly a living wage, and that it is not right for the Government to continue to employ them on such terms. .The whole question has been exhaustively discussed by representatives of the &apos; Treasury and the Departments chiefly concerned, and the unanimous conclusion has been reached that in all the circumstances, it would be desirable to arrive, if possible, at an agreed settlement with the Associations on the basis of an offer to extend the scales of Grade III clerks (&quot;P.&quot; &quot; P. IT.&quot; and temporary) by three annual increments of 2s. Qd. a week; the scales of Grade II clerks in the intermediate centres and provinces by three increments of 2s. Qd. a week; and the scales of Grade II Clerks in the London area by one increment of 5s. a week. On the basis of present numbers it is estimated that these proposals would involve an ultimate extra expenditure (maturing in three years) of  350,000 a year; but this increased expenditure would, of course, be offset by any reduction of numbers that may prove possible as time goes on.Treasury Chambers, April 18, 1929.
