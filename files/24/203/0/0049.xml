That report dealt in particular with their impressions of the financial situation in Australia, which had caused some anxiety before the Mission started, but he would like to assure the Council that the Mission had found the financial position, of Australia to be very sound.    No doubt experiments had been made in recent years in the way of expenditure on schemes which proved unprofitable.    Some of that expenditure was due to sentimental reasons such as making homes for returned soldiers, which meant big irrigation schemes and so on.   But half or more than half the Australian national debt of about 1,100 millions, was held by Australians themselves; and, according to the Missions estimate, a large proportion of that debt was reproductive, if one omitted the 290 millions of war debt, which naturally was not reproductive.   The whole aspect of Australian finance seemed quite sound, more especially as, having learnt from their mistakes, the Commonwealth had started a Development and Migration Commission, who are employed to vet - if he might use the term - every new scheme which would claim finance.    That Commission was composed of very able men and had a very able staff.    They work in alliance with a second Body, the Council of Scientific Research under Sir George Julius. The members of that Council were men of outstanding ability equal to any scientists in this country, and the general equipment of the Development and Migration Commission and the Council of Scientific Research spoke well for future develop-ment.   The Commission look at things more from the building and development point of view;    the Council busy itself when schemes odme forward connected with the study of the soil, the study of grasses, parasites and anti-parasites, and the improvement of the products of farming.Now it stood to reason that a young country like Australia had a difficulty in producing sufficient first class men for the work which lay before it, and it was essential that the people of this country should realise that they ought to collaborate with Australia if the best results were to be obtained.    It should be remembered that, partly owing to the climate, the Australian continent had been neglected by the human race for thousands of years, and it was only in the last 40 years or so that the best specimens of the British race had made it their business, by self-abnegation, by determination, and by taking all the risk that the pioneer had to run, to tackle the work and to make of Australia what it was today.

A 0 9NEXT MEETING.The next meeting is to be held on the second Wednesday in June, - June 12th - at 10 a.m.THE MISSION TO AUSTRALIA.SIR HUGO HIRST said that the members of the Advisory Council were probably aware that the report vrhich the Mission had submitted to the Australian Government had been published both in the Commonwealth and in this country.    That report dealt in particular with their Impressions of the financial situation in Australia, which had caused some anxiety before the Mission started, but he would like to assure the Council that the Mission had found the financial position, of Australia to he very sound.    No doubt experiments had heen made in recent years in the way of expenditure on schemes which proved unprofitable.    Some of that expenditure was due to sentimental reasons such as making homes for returned soldiers, which  &apos; meant big irrigation schemes and so on.   But half or more than half the Australian national debt of about 1,100 millions, was held by Australians themselves; and, according to the Mission1s estimate, a large proportion of that debt was reproductive, if one omitted the 290 millions of war debt, which naturally was not reproductive.   The whole aspect of Australian finance seemed quite sound, more especially as, having learnt from their mistakes, the Commonwealth had started a Development and Migration Commission, who are employed to vet - if he might use the term - every new scheme which would claim finance.    That Commission was composed of very able men and had a very able staff.    They work in alliance with a second Body, the Council of Scientific Research under Sir George Julius. The members of that Council were men of outstanding ability equal to any scientists in this country, and the general equipment of the Development and Migration Commission and the Council of Scientific Research spoke well for future develop-ment.   The Commission look at things more from the building and development point of view;    the Council busy itself when schemes come forward connected with the study of the soil, the study of grasses, parasites and anti-parasites, and the improvement of the products of farming.Now it stood to reason that a young country like Australia had a difficulty in producing sufficient first class men for the work which lay before it, and it was essential that the people of this country should realise that they ought to collaborate with Australia if the best results were to be obtained.    It should be remembered that, partly owing to the climate, the Australian continent had been neglected by the human race for thousands of years, and it was only in the last 40 years or so that the best specimens of the British race had made it their business, by self-abnegation, by determination, and by taking all the risk that the pioneer had to run, to tackle the work and to make of Australia what It was today. As much as could be done by empirical methods had now been done, and done successfully.   Further progress would have to
be made by the application of science and engineering.    These were^a few outlines of what Sir H. Hirst wished to say about the primary industries.The Mission&apos;s report dealt with suggestions of all kinds, with weaknesses that it was their business to find out, and the first of them was this.    Apart from wheat and wool, which Australia still produced as the world&apos;s paragon., they found that in- all industries that had been started and were to have helped Australia to attract people more radidly - industries such as sugar,  tinned and canned fruits, and others - there were certain difficulties in the v.&apos;ay of economic production, and they had taken the opportunity of bringing home to those industries that, owing to the assistance which they had had from Governments in the past, they had not made sufficient efforts themselves, but had relied too much on assistance from Government, by means of bounties or other devices imposed by legislation.    That could not go on, and it was quite clear that if those industries were to help Australia,  the assistance they required should come from the world-experience of the people of our own country,  our wider experience in lay-out, in transport,  in marketing in the markets of the world.      The Australian producers could not go to thoir Government any more for more protection and more bo-unties, and efforts must be made to make those Industries more efficient.That was one of the most important conclusions arrived at by the Mission, but it was more essential till when we came to what might be called the secondary industries.    It was not understood here why a country like Australia should wish to go in for manufacture at all.    But those who had visited Australia would have been struck,  as the members of the Mission were struck, by the fact that some QQ% of the population is urban population. The towns were in every way as modern and as  comfortable as ours; their lay-out was probably better; and the people had all the pleasures of the life that we lived.    They were particularly anxious to lead the same life; they naturally had the same aspirations; and, particularly after the scarcity of everyday materials during the war, were anxious to develop their own industries.    In that development, he thought, economics had not been sufficiently studied.    Everybody had been allowed to go ahead just as he thought fit; everything that involved a factory had been supported, and if at the end of the year there had been a loss,  the Government was approached for higher protection. That&apos;resulted in a. corresponding reply from Labour,.&apos; who wanted higher wages, and we were all familiar with,   (and it was dealt within the Mission&apos;s report), the effect cf these higher wages and higher protection.Now that had created a two-fold position.    Australia had not generally made Itself effective in the development of industries, and It had created an Industrial position which was very nearly a hold-up.    Sir Hugo wished to make an exception in the case of a few industries.    The Mission had been struck by the remarkable efficiency of some of the&apos; enterprises; and these were usually concerned with things for which the Australian population provided a consumption big enough to warrant the lay-out of production on a good scale.    More usually, however, Australia produced things haphazard.    For instance, Bradford, as one of the
tcentres of our woollen trade, might be making for the supply of the world&apos;s markets some, say, 400 different fabrics.    There had^been nothing to prevent Australia endeavouring to make every one of the fabrics that Bradford was making.    There had been no control, but tariff duties had been accorded with Insufficient regard to whether those duties were really justified or gave real advantage to their manufacturers.    Now Australia had wakened up from that condition, and Government and people realised, that those duties must be reconsidered.    It was the general desire to confine the duties to such things as Australia could manufacture efficiently, and to let other things be imported.    This was an important message which both the manufacturers and Mr. Bruce had impressed upon the Mission, to bring home.    Therefore those industries in this country that believed they had a market in Australia should endeavour - not each firm Individually but each industry collectively,- to study the present conditions there.    Australia had not at present a big enough demand to justify British electrical manufacturers or motor manufacturers or textile producers in competing with each other, whilst at the same time competing with the other countries as well.    Each industry that wanted &apos;to benefit by the Australian market ought to think in terms of,  say,  General Motors for the purpose of the service which should be given. If we were to go out with the desire to assist the Australians in their different industries in regard to those lines for which Australia offered a ready market, we could agree with them that in respect of,  say, twenty fabrics in the textile industry they were well, able to produce efficiently and make a profit under present conditions&apos;? and,  as for other fabrics, we could agree with them for a preference to be accorded on these when they were imported from this country.They all preferred that goods should be imported from Great Britain rather than from Jap*n or from Italy.    They preferred to deal with vis, but we had allowed the United States, in particular, to find a footing there from which It would be very difficult to dislodge them unless we introduced certain industries for which Australia offered a big market.    Australia was a country with a solid body of 6-g- million British people anxious to remain British,  and he had come back feeling that if Australia were built up in the North of Scotland he would not resent their starting certain factories, but would find It most natural.    Because, however,  they were far away, we were apt to think it was not their business to run factories, but in this our judgment was wrong.    We must realise that if we helped them they would remain an integral part of the British economic system.    They wanted to remain an integral partthey desired to be treated industrially as If Australia were where the Isle of Wight or where Scotland was,  and it was for us producers, for us who wished for co-operati,on with Australia,  to realise that and look at it in that way.    On the other hand, however efficient they might be In some respects,  only a very small proportion of Australians came to England,  and as a result most of the people had no standard of comparison except a standard of comparison with each other.    They were too far away from the white industrial countries of the world, and conscience was easily self-satisfied.    If they had machinery of 1927 they thought they were right up to date.    Without experience,  their economics were very hazy.
Now there was one thing that was almost tragic in the discussions which the members of the Mission had.    Quite apart from the special objects of the Mission, Australian business men found that they reaped certain benefits by personal discussions with the members, by having four other business men with wide experience to look at their problems from a fresh angle.     They did not realise that those men were a type of the business people who existed generally in this  country.    They knew nothing of the industries in this country which gave us the right to be proud; what they did know was the number of our unemployed.    They got those figures wired out every day.    They thought we were effete.    He wanted this Council to know that; it was most important.    They heard of all the good things in every other country,  and of all the bad things in our country. When he stood up in every city with his colleagues to tell them what the electrical and artificial silk industries were doing; when he told them we were employing nearly three quarters of a million people more th?n before the war; when he spoke of the fight we were waging against American and continental competition   when he gave these facts to them,  it was just like a revelation to them.    The one thing they had thought of was to go over to learn from America.    All the members impressed on them that the mass production methods of America would not teach the Australians much.    They must come to the more elastic methods of this country; we had an organisation here which would be more useful to them.Now every one of us must use his best endeavours in his own way of business to ensure that Australia did not think  -again what they had been thinking before the Mission went out.  -By the help which Mr. Bruce and the Government gave them, they had had the good fortune to win the confidence of business men and manufacturers in every State, and had fortunately been able to adjust the perspective advantageously but something should be done by every industry in this country to let Australia know what v/e were doing here.    In his own industry Sir Hugo Hirst had been impressing on engineers how wrong we were in this matter,  including indeed himself, although he had had a big organisation in Australia for over 30 years.    For example, his company had been given a contract for the London Electricity Board.    That meant a vast deal of work and organization of the very latest kind.    It had never struck him until he was in Australia that Australia would know nothing about this interesting enterprise until in about two years&apos; time the job was finished and a short notice of it might be published in some papers.    Australia wanted to know to-day what we were doing in Industry.    We must arrange so that they should live with us.    They wanted to be up to date.    He mentioned these matters because he wanted to show the effect the visit had had upon himself.    It was not true to say that they really knew what we were $ there was just that want of touch and Intimate contact  which every business organisation should promote.      Sir Arthur Duckham   had invited them to come over here, not only the employers but also the labour representatives, in order to discuss with the leaders of labour here why our leaders of labour to-day made different speeches from those
they made thirty years ago.    They would not take it from the Mission.    The best experience that we had got here should be put at the disposal of the Australians.    It had been frequently hinted that when Australians came over here they did not receive the same encouragement that they received in other countries,  to study processes and factories; that British manufacturers were not so ready with information and advice,  and the Australians were reluctant to ask for what was not freely given.To turn to a special case in which co-operation would be desirable,  the Australians did not like to have to buy so many American cars.    They would like a British design, - a joint design embodying some Australian industry; certain parts such as the bodies could be made in Australia, and for a period of ten or twenty years the making of those parts would be handed over to Australian production; the rest would be made here, and for the parts which were made in this country an increased preference should be given in the Commonwealth tariff. Sir Hugo was not a motor car manufacturer but he was encouraged by the presence of Sir Y/illiam Morris to refer to this proposal for co-operation, and he hoped it would, open out ideas for other industries to take up.Finally,  although the official work of the Mission was finished,  they had decided to keep together ss an unofficial body,  to give guidance and assistance to any industry or to any individual,  to make of themselves, for a time at least,  an unofficial liaison to give such advice as they could from the experience they had had and the knowledge they had gained to anybody who was interested in promoting better relations between this country and Australia.SIR ARTHUR BALFOUR said that he had very large connections in Australia and had heard from every part of Australia that this Mission had impressed people there and been welcomed by them.    The tact they had displayed from the beginning was admirable and their report had been generally accepted.    Their visit would lead to great developments In Australia if followed up in the way Sir Hugo Hirst had suggested.    There was no doubt that in the smaller industries one could not manufacture In Australia with success.    He had a saw factory of his own in Sydney and he could  still make saws in Sheffield, beat the 25 per cent, duty,  and deliver them better and quicker.    In many industries, however,  the Australians were going rapidly ahead.MR. HAYHURST asked how it would be decided which branches of the various industries were to be given up in the working out of schemes of co-operation.    He added that the Co-operative Wholesale Society had. a Mission in Australia now,  establishing canning factories for Australian fruit.    The Society were, in fact, making an effort on behalf both of Australian fruit and their meat.    When Sir Joseph Cross was here, he had said that a great deal of any necessary data could already be obtained at Australia House for any British trader who wanted it.
CONFIDENTIAL. THE MISSION TO -AUSTRALIA (QOHTD.)SIR HUGO HIRST replied that in regard to the first point, it would be the least efficient branches of business that would go out of existence.    The Austra3.ian cost of living had gone up to such an extent that it was adversely affecting the development of the country, and this was partly due to the protection of so many inefficient industries.   The Australians were aware of this and the report of the Mission had stated it in no uncertain terms.   &quot;In self-defence Australia would have to see to this if she wanted to avoid the crisis which was otherwise bound to come, because economics would always assert themselves in the end.    He believed that they were quite willing to put their house in order.SIR WILLIAM AlORRIS wished to refer to one of many cace3 in which the Australians were endeavouring to manufacture, but in which the limited demand prohibited them from manufacturing at a profit.    When he was in Australia he had been asked to Bee a shook absorber, a very good one, which had been locally manufacturedj    and he was asked if he would fit these shock-absorbers on all his oars in Australia,   He inquired the price of them, and was told, &quot; 7,10.0 a set&quot;.   He said &quot; 2.12.3d is my price&quot;.   His Interrogator was dumbfounded, but after a moment said, &quot;Well, I think we had better get you to manufacture them for us in England and send them to Australia.&quot;    Sir W. Morris said, &quot;That is&quot;quite impossible?    your duty is too high&quot;.   He confirmed Sir H. Hirst&apos;s report generally, and agreed in particular that more should be done to let the Commonwealth know about some of the things we were doing in this country,  and to prevent so many misleading reports, as for instance about unemployment, being sent out.    He said, &quot;They simply live on this stuff, because they are fed on it from morning to night.&quot;&apos;MR.WALKER stated that the hosiery trade in this country were greatly interested In Australia where there were many hosiery factories.    Possibly in the case of several articles of hosiery, such as underwear for men, which could always be produced with profit on m^ss production lines, the needs of Australia oould be provided to advantage by her own factories; but the variety of goods in the hosiery industry was so great that a considerable proportion of her requirements oould probably be more advantageously supplied by this country. Accordingly,  if our respective industries would mutually look at the problem in that way, and if Australia would thoroughly protect certain portions of the hosiery trade,  and allow us the opportunity of providing the other portions, including more the speciality goods,then no doubt we could, as Sir Hugo said, co-operate to the benefit of all.SIR HUGO HIRST added that when one spoke of there being six and a half million people in Australia, it should be realized that owing to the high purchasing power of the average Australian, and owing to certain social conditions which made -some commodities a necessity there whilst over here &quot;they were not so, the extent of the Australians&apos; requirements in many trades represented much more than what was meant to us by a population of six and a half millions;    it would bo ntore
A Q Olike ten, twelve, or fifteen millions to us in this country in some trades, motor cars for instance.    The number of cars in Austral a was one to every eleven persons, while over here it was only about one for every thirty-three.    That was true also in a many other industries,MR, LENNOX LEE mentioned that, in the cotton industry, the variety of goo^s required by Australian women was so great that to produce them all in Australia would not be possible.    The Oalico Printers&apos;  Association, however, sent there regularly, maintained a large house there and did what was possible to get into olose touch with their customers.SIR W, RAINS mentioned that two or throe years ago, on behalf of the Chambers of Commerce, he had discussed with Mr, Samuel at the Department of Overseas Trade the question of propaganda abroad and had joointed out how the Americans spent a lot of time, and possibly money, in getting first class reports boosting their country, put not only into Australia but into all other countries, while little or nothing ever appeared   about our trade.   He thought, after what had been stated by Sir Hugo Hirst, that it might be to the advantage of the country if the Department of Overseas Trade could devote some attention to that very     . &quot; &quot; important question.MR, HACKING pointed out that very much more appeared in the newspapers now as to what this country was achieving.    There was a time when every contract lost was published in the Press but that was   very, rarely seen now.    There was a service of news of a helpful character sent out by the Foreign Office from Rugby every evening, and that was doing a great doal of good.COAL.MR, WARHAM stated that the weekly output of coal in the United Kingdom in April was somewhat less than in March;    for the weeks ending 15th and 20th April it was 5,352,000 tons and 5,281,000 tons, but the average output for the eight weeks ending 20th April was 5,166,000 tons, or 93$ of tho 1913 average. Tho number of persons employed in the industry for the wook ending April 20th was 940,700,  equal to 84,7 per cent, of the 1913 average.   Unemployment for the month of March was 13,2 per oent, as compared with 15.3 per cent, in February and 15,8 per cent, average for 1925       The quantity of coal exported from Groat Britain for the month of March was 4,763,297 tons, as compared with 3,890,030 tons in February 1929 and 6,115,677 tons ayerage for 1913.    The value per ton in March was 18s.Id. as compared with 15s,8d. in February.The increased production in March and April showed that tho output had very nearly reaohed the level of 1913.     Our share of the European capacity for production was much smaller
COAL (OGNTD).than it used to be. so that a rise of our output to such a level could only be due to the extreme col d. No doubt the consumption of fuel was increasing, but not enough to cover the 15% increase in the British rate of production,    Good coking coal was very firm, reflecting the better position of the European steel trade, but there was not such a great demand for house and steam coal0    On the other hand,  increases in wages were taking place in Germany and in Poland, though it was not clear whether they would be on a scale large enough to make any serious difference to their competitive position. On the whole, he was doubtful whether a market could be found for British coal upon the March and April scale of production, at any rate, during the summer months.The local scheme of control of output in Scotland had broken down, and it had not yethoen found possible to persuade a large enough number of the coal owners to adopt the new plan. The result seemed to have created almost a panic, prices falling from 17s.6d. to about 13s. a ton for best East of Scotland steam coal.    It was rumoured too, that some alteration might be made in the Midland scheme.   It seemed so far to have been found impossible to propose any selling arrangement which would not fail to aatisfy a substantial minority of the interests involved.The interim report of the Economic Committee of the League of Nations on the coal trade put the difficulties with which we were faced very clearly.    There was no doubt that if by some miracle trade could again be carried on on natural economic lines, with no subsidised railway rates, no reparations in coal, and no restrictions \-.pon free imports, this country would again get a much larger share of the international coal trade.    Unfortunately there seemed very little prospect of that at the present moment.LORD GAUM FORD observed that steam coal was in fair request but very little business was being arranged at the present moment in connection with next half-year.    The blast furnace trade had somewhat improved.    Basic iron was in demand, but no additional furnaces were likely to be put in except those already arranged for, until prices had improved.    There had -been an almost entire lapse in the export of coke recently, and although the price had fallen something like four shillings a ton, very little business was being done.    It was not anticipated that contracts   would be made just now on a remunerative scale for the next half-year; but we were living in hope as we had -done before.SIR. WALTER RAINE stated that the Durham gas coal trade was very busy at the present time, and it was not possible to get sufficient of this class of coal, which wae produced on the sea board between Sunderland and Hartlepool and which was the best gas coal in the world, to satisfy the demand.    The price had risen in the past month from about 13s.6d. to at least
COAL (COiiTD).16s,,6d,    There was no doubt that the Dawdon strike had accentuated the position to a certain extent, but even if that output   were available it would not satisfy the present demand,    Members of the Council would have noticed in the Press that Lord Londonderry had made a quite definite statement, which had been known to those concerned in the North of England for some time, that there was no difference of opinion between himself and the miners&apos;  leaders in Durham as to the situation at Dawdon,   and that the strike was being run by Communists who were determined to keep the men out of work.In connection with the export coal trade, there was a f irm-ness in the freight market which was unusual at this time of the year;   particularly in the Mediterranean freights there had been a rise of about Is, over those obtaining six weeks ago.   That was oaused, apparently, by many ships being out of employment through the ice trouble in the Baltic and other places, with the result that on the one hand there was an undoubted shortage of tonnage and on the other the ship repairing yards on the North-east coast and at Liverpool were very busy.IRON AND STEEL.MR.BOND reported steady business in iron and steel during April.    Progress was slow, but there was a constant increase in the volume of production of iron and steel in the country. Tne pig iron position had been exceptionally strong as compared with the past few years and was likely to continue so.    The consumption of steel in the world was showing a distinct increase, and that must result in a larger demand for pig iron,THE PRESIDENT mentioned that he had just set up a small committee of three to go into the scrap position, because he did not think any one had really all the informauion that was wanted.    He hoped that committee would be able to  arrive at some useful conclusion,MR. BOND, continuing, said there was much less foreign competition in semi-finished steel; semi-finished steel was being produced in this country today at a price which would compete with that at which it was being offered from-abroad. In   South Wales the demand for tin plates was better, and order books were fairly well filled.    There would probably be this year a larger export of tin plates from this country than ever before.    The capacity for production was large and prices were rather cut, but the volume of business was good, and, as a result of our arrangement with the United States, we had got a good deal of business which we should not otherwise have had.    The sheet trade remained in an unsatisfactory condition.Generally, speaking, there was steady progress in the iron and steel industry.    Costs of production were still too
3 illIROK AND STEEL ( CONTD ).high, but that matter was being Investigated in different districts.    The iron and steel trade would welcome very much (when the matter could be made public) the announcement which the president  had made confidentially, of a mission to South America, because that was a big market   where we were not likely to be faced with Internal competition in manu-facturing:- see the section on South American trade.LORD GAINFORD reported that on the North-East coast the finished steel trade had had a considerable amount of work and an improved position lately;    but what one was frightened of was the future.   No new orders, apparently, were coming in for shipbuilding nor for constructional or any other work for the next half-year.     The railway companies were sending forward at this period of the year tenders for rails, and these might help. Prices of semi-finished steel up to the present time had been well maintained.    The imports in March of iron, steel, including scrap, were 183,000 tons, and the exports were 382,000 tons.   As in former months, an interesting feature was that whilst we exported a greater quantity of pig iron and finished steel, we were making more semi-finished products than we exported. In Germany and Prance the cost of production appeared to be going up and the competitive capacity of their products was rather less than it had been.    That was a satisfactory feature, - Belgian miners had just got a   five per cent, increase in their wages and In the engineering trades the men were asking for ten per cent., and the owners offering them five per cent.STEEL.SIR ARTHUR BALFOUR observed that he had only been home for about three weeks after his journey, but he thought that trade prospects were decidedly better.    Home trade was very much better and (what he regarded as a very good guide) the alloys, tungsten and vanadium, were being produced today in this country, and sold, almost at the war level; this showed that there was a tremendous consumption of alloys, tungsten and vanadium.    They were also being made in this country for consumption abroad, v/hich was a very hopeful sign.    The special steels generally were doing well, except, of course&apos; in the United States which was a bad market; but generally all our export markets were doing quite well and prospects were very good, -much better than they had been at any time in the last six or seven years.
NON-FERROUS METALS.CAPTAIN LYTTELTON stated that the demand for copper had been quiet, but when confidence in the market had been restored, good orders for cables would probably be placed. The high price had affected the brass industry slightly, and had led to a certain increase in the use of substitutes. The tinplate works in South Wales were operating at 75% to 80fo of capacity, but fresh orders were rather slow in coming in. The cable trade had bought fairly well in lead.    In spelter the galvanisers reported that Indian orders were slow in coming in, and South Wales works were making to some extent for stock.    There was considerable improvement in the galvanising trade in the Black Country.    One interesting point about spelter was that the English production of the metal had gone up by 500 to 700 tons a month, -which was an increase of 10/o to 14^.    That seemed to show that the industry was getting properly established here, and when the Government contract ran out there would be a large production of the metal in the country.There was considerable activity in the aluminium industry, which was turning out bigger and bigger castings.SHIPBUILDING AND MARINE ENGINEERING.MR. RICHMOND wrote:-&quot;In marine engineering, the current position shows an improvement over recent returns and a steady volume of work is assured for 3ome months to come.    Lloyd&apos;s returns at the end of March show that there were&apos;3&apos;38 vessels of 1,357,375 tons gross under construction in Great Britain and Ireland. The number is greater by 13 and the tonnage is less by 83,467 tons than at the end of March 1938. On the north-east coast, there has been a slight cessation of orders recently, but moat of the engine shops are -veil booked ahead and the repair business is very active.    Enquiries from abroad are increasing and further Canadian orders are anticipated.&quot;The access of foreign work may be taken to indicate that not only are British prices satisfactory in comparison with foreign, but that other factors - rapidity in delivery, high quality in design and workmanship, - are playing their part in attracting orders to this country.    At the end of March, next to the British Dominions, Norway had the largest amount of foreign tonnage under construction in the United Kingdom and France the next.&quot;On the Clyde, an important order has been placed by the Lloyd-Brasiliero of Rio de Janeiro for 18 steamers.&apos;&quot;&apos; Greenock has secured 6 of these as well as 4 high classtfThe 3oard of Trade have since been informed by Mr. Hose that the Company have instructed their London agents to make a public denial of this report.

The work already booked should maintain a steady level of employment until the autumn.    The possibility of higher   wages and the tendency of raw material prices to advance may accelerate the placing of further orders rather sooner than the autumn, when an expanding demand for cargo vessels is expected to develop.    The unemployment figures in the district although still bad, are showing an improvement, but it would appear that the possibility of reducing these to a pre-war percentage is remote.    The Clyde shipbuilding output in   1928 was 604,611 tons, a figure which is little belpw the average in immediate pre-war years, and during the year the unemploy-ment figures fluctuated closely around 12 per cent for marine engineers and 25 per cent for shipbuilders and repairers. This would appear to indicate that   with their increased and improved facilities, more efficient management, and the absence of labour disturbances, an annual output of 600,000 tons can be secured with a large decrease in labour force. Taking the monthly unemployment figures of marine engineers on the Clyde for 1998, these average 1,420 unemployed, and for shipbuilders and repairers 8,453.   While an improvement in world trade would favourably influence the demand for ships and engines, the excess of shipbuilding and marine engineering facilities, both in thi3 country and abroad, make it doubtful if the Clyde figure of round 600,000 tons is likely to be exceeded.

MOTOR INDUSTRY.^SXR WILLIAM MORRIS observed that trade was steady, business was good, and it appeared that it would continue so for some time if weather conditions continued favourable. Overseas orders were not specially good.    The industry was not getting support from the Government in that direction, whioh was a great pity.SIR CYRIL HURCOMB thought the Council might like to have the figures of motor vehicles registered for the first time in recent months.    These were figures that the Ministry of Transport had hitherto published quarterly, but, in view of the importance attached to them by motor manufacturers, the Ministry had now arranged to publish   them every month.    The number of motor vehicles newly registered in March 1929 was greater than the number so registered in any previous month since the record started two years ago.    The figures, which for March 1929 were provisional,  showed that oars taxed on horse power were more numerous in March 1929 than in March 1928 by 584.    Of goods vehicles there were 1,769 more, and of hackney vehicles 411 more0    Even motor cycles, which had been declining,  shewed an increase in March 1929 as compared with March 1928.    The total figures for the three months, December 1928 and January and February 1929, compared with the corresponding three months of the previous year also showed increases.     The number of oars taxed on horse power newly registered in those throe months was 37,193 as against 33,633 a year before.     There were 10,590 goods vehicles as compared with 7,925 a year before, while hackney vehicles were about the same.    These figures of new registrations, of course, included imported vehicles as well as those manufactured at home.COTTON.MR. H*W, LEE observed that the cotton textile trade as a whole was still in a wretched condition and was running to a certain extent short time in both the American and Egyptian sections,     Th6y were handicapped by the rise in the bank rate, and they were v*sry considerably handicapped by the nearness of the Election.    Reductions in the price of cotton had also brought about a very weak condition of values.    On .&apos;the whole the position was not any worse than a month ago, but there was no real improvement.With regard to the dispute about the Alma Mill, the oardroom section of the Oldham trade had oaused the trouble, but the general amalgamation of labour in the industry was entirely against it, and had advised the operatives at the Mill to resume work.    Under those circumstances, he did not think there was any likelihood of a general stoppage taking place.
COTTON (CONTD.).The schemes of amalgamation of mills were going on very slowly.   That In the American trade was possibly making a little progress, but that progress was undoubtedly very slow and there -was a great amount of ground to be covered before the fortunes of the trade would be affected.     Another combination was being proposed among the mills in the spinning trade using Egyptian cotton, though nothing was settled for the moment on that subject.Sift EEOTfcTH STEWART sent the following:-&quot;The exports of cotton piece goods for the first three months of this year show how stabilised this business has become.The linear   yardage of these exports has been:-1,032 Million Yards for 1927.1,072 &quot; w      it    ig28.1,065 &quot; &quot;      n    1929.or an average of 1,035 million.yards.For similar periods pre-war the averages were:-1907/9 average 1,490 million yards,1910/12      &quot;        1,616       &quot; &quot;&quot;The effect has been, as is well known, disastrous to the mills, especially in the American section of the trade where most of the loss of business has occurred,      I have had an opportunity of analysing the balance sheets of some 200 mill companies in this section of the trade, and a number of profit and loss accounts.      The effects of the situation which has arisen from this tremendous fall in exports is evident. A short summary may be interesting.     These mills owe to their creditors about  29,000,000.      The value of their assets, generously estimated does not amount to more than  28,000,000. Their earnings, before deducting interest and depreciation, amount to about  460,000.     Allowing a minimum&apos;amount of depreciation and interest, these mills are getting worse off yearly at the rate of about  2,000,000.    Wholesale liquidation is inevitable, but if It occurs, then our export trade in piece goods must dininish at a rapid pace.    Obviously this is a. case for rationalization, if ever there was one. Such a oourse must entail great sacrifices all round and great restraint on the part of creditors.    So far from the case being hopeless, there appears to me to be little doubt that if the&apos; affair is promptly taken in hand, much may be saved from the wreck and Indeed with a deliberate policy of careful reconstruction much of the lost trade regained.
COTTON  (CONTD.).nOne&apos;s reports on the trading position must be rather colourless.    The trade has stabilised itself on this lower level for the time being.    Generally, the reports of merchants are not very encouraging for the immediate future. Most markets are dull, which is being felt not only by ourselves, but by every other exporting country.    Disturbances in India and uneasiness in China are affooting our Far Eastern markets and are curtailing orders.     South America is quiet, and there are no markets which&apos;-give much cause for encouragement,&quot;Spinners&apos; losses are increasing for the time being. With the present state of affairs there is little demand and the few orders offered are being scrambled for.    So far as we can see, the total business will be much on the same scale as previous years.&quot;MR. LENNOX LEE said that, in view of the recent date of his appointment to the Council as the representative of the Federation of British Industries, he was unable at that meeting to say anything on behalf of the Feieration,     As regards the cotton textile trade, the position was distinctly bad. Some idea of the state of our trade with India,whioh was our large market,  could be given by the fact that seven years ago the Japanese Imported into India 90,000,000 yards of- cotton pieoe goods,     while last year they delivered 350 million yards.NOTE.    See the Appendix (page 29 ) for a memorandum by the Board of Trade and Ministry of Labour on the question of hours of labour in fine cotton spinning in the. United States, which was raised at the last meeting of the Advisory Council on 10th April (see page 13 of the minutes of that meeting).WOOL.SIR FREDERIC AYKR0YD observed that the wool textile industry of the West Riding was rather better employed and  . there vVas more machinery running, but a great deal pf the business had been obtained by out-throat competition.    The published figures of the shipments of wool from Australia during the period 31et July,  1928, to 31st March, 1929, showed that the United Kingdom had obtained 40,000 bales less than last year, and he regarded this as a little serious towards the end of the year, since the quantity of raw material obtained was after all the basis of production. Belgium and Holland had bought 33,000 bales more than last year, while Japan had now reached the large figure of 255,000 bales as against 5,000 pre-war.   Russia had imported from Australia just twice as much wool as last year.
WOOL (CONTD.),In wool combing the position was quite as good as last month - 65$ of the machinery running as against 67$ in February.    In the spinning section, the fine spinners were busy;    80$ of the spindles were running, which was 2-g$ more than a month ago, and the highest point reached since the Spring of 19 28.    In oross-*bred spinning business was bad.In manufacturing,  the dress trade was very bad.    44$ of the looms were running full time, 28$ half time, and 28$ standing,    Bradford was emerging from the lowest point experienced during the last three years.    In the other section of manufacturing, the men&apos;s wear trade, in the Huddersfield and Keighley districts, was on the up grade and was steadily improving.    In Yeadon and Guiseley, business was quieter, and where firms were previously running overtime, they were now only moderately employed.There was a very keen desire in the West Riding that the Board of Trade should watch the Spanish tariff and do all they oould to prevent higher duties.    The mission had just returned from Russia, and revealed various opinions. Some regarded trade with Russia as not a very great risk, while others thought it should be left alone.     He personally believed that the West Riding had benefited as a result of trade obtained from Russia.    Traders as a whole were certainly taking more risks than they had taken.    They oould not discount their bills, but a number of firms were taking Russian orders and locking up their bills. .HOSIERY, BOOTS AND SHOES.MR. WALKER reported that there had been a marked improvement in the boot and shoe industry.   Most of the firms had been working full time.    Export trade had been better, though not quite up to the usual standard for the time of year.In regard to hosiery, the position   was very much the same as in the previous month, perhaps a little better. Makers of silk and artificial silk hosiery continued to,be buoy.    It might be of interest to the membors of the Council to know that the price of silk and artificial silk stockings had fallen Binoe the imposition of the silk duties. Mr,, Walker produced a pair of artificial silk stockings the wholesale price of which had oome down since 1925 from 15/9 to ll/6 per doz.  pairs.   A second sample, made of silk, cost 59/- per doz, pairs in 1925, but was now sold at 5l/-j but, still more interesting was the fact that in 1925 the panel of silk in this stocking was 20 inches long and today it was 5^ Inches longer, showing a really remarkable reduction in price since the duties came in.
CHEMICALS.MR. HILL said that the chemical industry had been quite uneventful during the last month, and there had been no setback from the favourable situation reported at the previous Council.    Mr, Hill handed in the following note on a matter which was of great interest to the chemical trades.NOTE TO THE PRESIDENT HANDED IN BY MR. HILL.&quot;A matter of great interest, which has become increasingly prominent, is the question of patent law.    The chemical industry welcomes your announcement of the setting up of a committee to investigate the patent la?/.    The Association of British Chemical Manufacturers-, through its Patents Committee, is giving much consideration from the point of view of the chemical industry to the recommendations contained In the valuable report of the British Science Guild, and is now engaged on the preparation of a memorandum of its views regarding the amendments which are desirable in the Patents Acts from the chemical manufacturers&apos; point of view.Mpartiou3.arly is a thorough revision of the position required in the case of medical and biological products.    I need only remind you, as an instance, of the case of synthetic vitamin D, in whi&amp;h a year ago you gave me such extremely valuable sympathy and assistance.    Here is an outstanding example of an important discovery, made by British workers in this country, in a British Government institution, the fruits of which are snatched by an American-owned British patent.    There are other rather disquieting features in regard to patents covering the outcome of bio-chemical and biological work, rendering the thorough investigation which you are proposing to hold extremely welcome.&quot;In regard to these biochemical products, this country continues to maintain the leading position which it has won in this field of fine chemical manufacture.    It is of interest to report that a scheme of co-operation has been agreed between the Medical Research Council and the Association of British Chemical Manufacturers in connection with research work on new therapeutic compounds.    Strenuous efforts are being made to maintain our leading position and independence in regard to insulin, despite the determined invasion by a German product which is now taking place.    As each new medical discovery is made, industrial workers in thjLs country are ready immediately to take advantage of it.    The- same equipment, technique and personnel for one product are available for the unknown thing directly it comes along; and this position, which has given happy results in making available so quickly new remedies for the relief of human suffering, is a direct outcome of the operation of the Safeguarding of Industries Act.    The price of insulin has just been reduced.    Prices of other biochemical products have recently been redtioed.     This is due to efficient manufacture, which in turn is due to Safeguarding&quot;.
CONFIDENTIALRUBBER.SIR GEORGE BEHARRELL reported that the rubber industry was reasonably busy, the main product being, of course, motor tyresj and they were slightly better than last year.   Export was difficult, the competition from America being very keen at the present time.   The trade in motor oyole tyres was not quite so good as last year    there was a big demand for oyole tyres, but there we were meeting with very low price foreign competition from the Continent.    General rubber goods were fairly satisfactoryj    there were isolated articles in respect of whioh there was keen competition and low prices, but, generally speaking, there was a reasonable demand for mechanical and surgical goods and hose and belting.GENERAL TRADE.SIR WALTER RAINE reported an increase in the exports of Nottingham lace for the first quarter of this year over the preceding quarter.    Artificial silk was finding increasing favour for the manufacture of window decorations, and the beautiful effects produced were attracting considerable attention.    As soon as methods could be found of preventing the crushing and creasing of the fabric there would be a still greater demand for artificial silk.    The making-up trade in the textile industry in Nottingham was experiencing the greatest difficulty in getting sufficient skilled workers to cope with the business in hand.    The provision trade of Liverpool was very active.    Bacon was1 dear at the beginning of April, but it fell by as much as ISs. to 18s. per cwt. during the month.An interesting fact in his report from Liverpool in connection with the West African trade was the gradual tendency for the transfer of the oontrol of these businesses from Liverpool to London.   Up to now it was having no effect on the actual trade from Liverpool.   The prioe of palm kernels had fallen  3 during the past year-, the price being  17,15s, a ton at the end of March as compared to  20,15s. in March twelve months ago.   The ascertained wholesale price of   landed fish at Hull in March was about 2d. a pound, and it was therefore no wonder that there was a great outcry amongst the rank and file of people in this country with regard to the retail price of fish.Op-operative Wholesale Society.MR. HAYHURST referred to the continued increase in savings, as mea-sured by the deposits of the banking department of the
GENERAL TRADER (OOSTip. )Go-op er at iv e , Who lg a ale Society.Society.   He understood that a similar increase was taking plaoe in Scotland as well.   He was glad to be able to say that the fear he had expressed at the last meeting of the Council that the benefit of any reduction in the duty on-tea would not he passed on- to the consumer had not been realised.   The 3-g-d had boen passed on, with another halfpenny added, to it.    At the time of the Budget there were great withholdings of deliveries, but there would now be an increased consumption.The following is an extract from a statement handed in by Mr. Hayhurst:-Total trade of the Go-operative Wholesale Society for the year 1928, 872 million pounds sterling.Some of the principal items of sale are as under:Valuo of Butter sold .......10h million pounds sterling,&quot;      &quot; Flour &quot; .......72       &quot; &quot; &quot;&quot;      &quot; Sugar &quot; .....&quot;      &quot; Tea &quot; r....&quot;      n Bacon &quot; .....rt      &quot; 3oap &quot; .....n      n Cheese &quot; .....n      &quot; Lard &quot; ......ft      &quot; Coal &quot; -&apos; .....n      &quot; Drapery &quot; .....Boots &amp;Shoes &quot; .....tt tt8	1!	n	n6^	n	ft	ft5	ti	tt	woi -	ft	it rt	n			o	n	it	fto	it	ft	tt2	it	ft	n72	K	rt	n2*	tt	tt	ft3*	tt	o *	tfThese figures must not, however, be confused with the sales of the whole of the Oo-operative Movement, inasmuch as they represent our Bales to Co-operative Societies only.    Tho last Statement prepared, viz., for 1927, shows the following remarkable figures for the United Kingdom:Membership. ......... . .over 5-1- millions;       tTrade................324^- million pounds sterling;Employees ...........225,000;Wages paid............over 29 million pounds sterling.The figures for 1928 are expected to be considerably more than for 1927.Grocery and Provisions. - Butter.

Following a decline in wheat prices, the flour market has been on the easy side - orders, however, have &quot;been of a satisfactory charaoter.bacon and Hams. During last week there was a reduction of 10/- per ewt. on Oontinental supplies.    No doubt the Continental attitude will influence the position, and a lowering of values appears to be imminent.Tea. During April the Budget annofjncement was made, and the trade as a whole immediately dropped prices over-the-counter by 4d. per lb.    Because of this, on^the Empire grown teas, the trade at once stood to lose over f-d per lb., and on the average the loss   Is about &quot;id., because some 75$ of the total consumption of tea in Britain is now Empire-grown.It is expected in the trade that the cheapening of teas by the Budget drop will put a further impetus on the demand, and it is encouraging to note that packet tea at the present time is being retailed over-the-counter at as low a price as Is.2d. per lb.coffee. Oosta Rioa coffees, continue to be in demand, notwithstanding the efforts of the Empire-grown coffee from East Africa, and the trade, seems to have a great faith in the keeping qualities of Oosta Rioas, so that they are able to be bought well ahead for storage.Ooooa.    There has been no change since last report, because there Is no buying in west Africa until the middle crop next month.DISTRIBUTIVE TRADES.SIR WOODMAN BURBIDGE wrote -&quot;Trade comparisons with April 1928 are unfortunately again affected by the fact that the Easter trade fell in April last year, whereas this year the distributive trades had to contend with the period of quiet    trading which normally follows the holiday.    As against this, the figures for April this year are improved by the fact that they cover three extra working days.    It is a fact that the distributive trades are probably more affected than others by variations in the date of Easter, and they are therefore more anxious than most to see International agreement with regard to a Fixed Easter&apos;.&quot;The month was clearly marked by variations in trade. After a period of flatness at the beginning of April, following the holidays, trade improved considerably, and became quite brisk during the middle fortnight, and then tailed off in the last week, largely owing to the inclement weather.&quot;The figures to hand show that the west-end stores had a curiously different experience to the other parts of the country, and the rest of London.   Last month it will be remembered that &quot;there was a definite tendency for piece-goods to fall off in favor of the fashion departments, and this was largely explained by the buying
DISTRIBUTIVE TRADES  (CONTD.)of women&apos;a wear prior to the holidays.    As anticipated, piece-goods departments made a better showing this month, and a practically uniform series of improvements are reported over 1S28, arid such decreases as are reported are accounted for by special circumstances.    During the month the general impression had been&apos; that the fashion departments v/ere moving slowly,  and it Is therefore the more surprising to find the majority of the west-end stores reporting substantial increases as compared with April last year, which had, in addition, the benefit of the pre-Easter Trade.    The increases amount in some cases to as much as 24^, and instances of shrinkage in sales in the fashion departments in the west-end are of comparatively minor importance.    This is quits contrary to the experience in the other parts of London, and for the rest of the country. Furniture shows a very welcome recovery, increases of from 15% to 20$ being common, and no decreases reported.    The west-end has suffered, however, with the rest of the country, from the weather,  in the boot and shoe departments; the exceptionally dry spell has seriously affected sales,  and the figures have been maintained only with the greatest difficulty where there are no shrinkages to report.&quot;In the suburbs of London very definite tendencies are to be observed in accordance with the experience of the rest of the country.    Sales of piece-goods are up, fashion departments uniformly down, boots and shoes down, and furniture well up. These movements can be accounted for by the weather, and the effect of the different dates of Easter on the character of the buying.&quot;The reports to hand from the North show a curiously uniform experience, more or less on the lines of the outer London stores. Piece-goods are up fully 10$; in the fashion departments sales in some cases have been maintained with difficulty, but general experience has been a fall of between 8 and 10$; men&apos;s wear is about level, with a.falling off in one or two instances; boots and shoes are down at least 12% on the average; while furniture shows an improvement in the neighbourhood of 15$.  In Wales and the South of England the same tendencies, can be observed, but not to such a marked extent.&quot;From all parts of the country, as anticipated,  cheerful reports are to hand regarding the sales of sports goods, and sports wear generally, and the trade in these sections has been very brisk, with a marked improvement over last year.&quot;SHIPPING.MR. ALEXANDER SHAW said there was no marked change in the position of the shipping industry.Recently enquiries had been made to find some substance for door fittings in ships, handles for windows and perhaps scuttle fittings,  instead of the usual brass or lacquer, because, even when lacquered, these things,  owing to the action of sea air,  soon became full of verdigris, and caused a tremendous amount of labour.    Chromium plating had been suggested, but he had been informed that at the present stage it was unreliable.    If a reliable system of chromium plating which would not peel off were available, then it would be of enormous advantage to shipowners.

RAILWAY TRAFFIC.SIR CYRIL HURCOMB pointed out that the receipts  or April were, affected by the Incidence of Easter, and it was better to look at the receipts for the first 17 weeks of the year.   The coal traffic receipts, in.the 17 weeks of this year as compared with the corresponding period of 1928, showed a substantial increase of  1,100,000 distributed over the four railway groups, but the merchandise receipts were down by  860,000, and the passenger reoeipts were down still more, by  945,000.   The net result for all traffics was a decrease of  694,000.    These were the gross receipts of the railway companies and did not represent the actual volume of charge paid by traders who were getting the rebate on the selected traffi&amp;s.    As regards the individual traffics, the colder weather in february-ry brought about some reductions, notice-ably in the building trade.SIR JOSIAH STAMP sent the following:- ...A comparison of the railway traffic receipts of the four groups for &quot;the seventeen weeks ended 28th April, 1929, corn-pared with the corresponding period of 1928, shows the following results:-PASSENGER TRAIN RECEIPTS   are down 4 per cent, decreases beingrecorded on each Groups as under:-  %L.M.S.                          393,000 4.72L.N.E.                          256,000 4,63G.W..                              148,000 4.09S.R.                                146,000 3.05Total .......        945,000 4.24MERCHANDISE, -OTHER .MINERALS AND LIVE STOCK RECEIPTS show adecrease&apos; of&quot;  860,900 or 4 per cent, each Company&apos;s share of the losses being:-  %L.M.S.                          473,900 4.79L.N.E.                          309,000 4.29G.W.                                15,000 0.41S.R.                                 63,000 4.72Total........      860,gQO 5.89COAL AND COp^REGglPTS continue to record an improvement, the total increase being  1,109,900 or nearly 10 per cent.

EMPLOYMENT.MR. PHILLIPS stated that the unemployment figures in April were on the whole disappointing.    There was a set back after Easter, followed by some recovery in the txvo following weeks, but on the 29th April there vvas an increase of 23,000. This last increase took place almost entirely in the Midlands and North of England; it was confined to persons temporarily stopped, and apparently was due to short time working in the coal industry.    Taking the month as a whole there was an increase in unemployment of 58,000 in the Midlands and North of England, and a reduction of 28,000 in the rest of England and Wales.Preliminary figures for the industrial classification of the unemployed on 22nd April showed an increase as compared with a month earlier of 2,6 per cent, in coal (entirely among the, temporarily stopped), a reduction of 2.6 per cent, in building, an increase of 2.2 per cent, in cotton, a reduction of 1 per cent, in woollen and worsted, and a reduction of 1,8 per cent, in shipbuilding and ship repairing.The table of numbers of insured persons in employment, which Mr. Phillips handed in, showed a total of 10,147,000 on 22nd April.    This was the highest total so far recorded, being 30,000 higher than that for April of last year, which was the previous highest.Monthly Statistics of insured persons aged 16 to 64 in employment.Estimated number of insured per-sons in employment after deducting from col.4 3^ per cent, of the numbers in col.2 to allow for sickness^ and other unrecorded non-employment, exclusive of temporary holidays.Bate.Hi)Estimated number of insured persons.(2)Number ofinsured persons urv-employed (including two months file  of lodged books).(S)Difference betweencolumns 2 &amp; 5  (to nearest hundred).(4)Including persons directly involved in trade disputes.Excluding persons directly involved in trade disputes.(6).  _18:Apr... may...

AUSTRALIAN TRADE.SIR FREDERICK YOUNG sent a report to the following effectBales of wool received Into store from 1st July to 31st March last were 2,517,677; 2,201,755 were sold and 23,266 shipped for sale overseas.   The recent rain in New South Wales and Queensland had practically assured the growing clip in those States.    The Commonwealth sheep flocks were estimated at 105 millions, &quot;being 35 per cent, larger than in 1920.    In the closing sales at Melbourne and Geelong the competition came particularly from Yorkshire, with keen support from Japan and Continent.    The butter exported during the ten months ended March last totalled 38,664,000 lbs. the largest quantity since the record 1924/25 season.    The export operations in the beef exporting States were rapidly increasing and slaughtering was expected to reach the peak by second week in May.    Australia secured&quot;during April a Hawaiian contract for two million pounds of tinned meat.    A conference of wheat growers last month passed a resolution that the Commonwealth Constitution be amended to give power to enforce compulsory pools managed by representa-tives of growers when the majority desired.    Since the opening of the present season 60,184,000 bushels of wheat and 247,000 tons of flour were exported from Commonwealth, compared with-25,358,000 bushels and 158,000 tons last season.The shipping conference last month between Sir Alan Anderson&apos;s overseas shipping delegation and representatives of Australian exporting and Importing interests unanimously recommended the formation of committees representing shipowners and shippers for consideration of various questions with a view to the improvement of shipping services. - Action was now proceeding to form such committees.A body called the Australian National Travel Association has been formed for the purpose of raising  100,000 with the object of attracting to the Commonwealth tourists., investors and investor settlers.    The Commonwealth Government contributes  1,000 per annum for five years and the Development and Migration Commission co-operates in the scheme.    Export for trade purposes of Australian birds has been prohibited.    The Commonwealth Tariff Board is to investigate the desirability of reoealing the coastal clauses of the Navigation Act and the substitution either8 of a tax on inter-State passengers and cargo carried by overseas ships, or a subsidy or bounty to Australian shipping, or the licensing on payment of the overseas vessels engaged in Australian trade.    The Commonwealth Government decided to continue the English trade publicity scheme for a further three years under A.E. Hyland.INDIAN TRADE.MR. GREEN mentioned that he would have to postpone his remarks about the trade figures for the month ending March 30th, as he had as yet only received telegraphic advices.
INDIAN TRAPS (CONTD).Climatic conditions were, on the whole, favourable in India,,,    The final estimate of the wheat crop showed a lower acreage sown, but a probable out-turn higher by some half a million tons than that of the preceding year, which had been a bad one.       The estimated out-turn, however, of a little over 8^-million tons was by no means high, and imports were likely to continue.    The final estimate for cotton had been delayed, owing to the difficulty of arriving at the amount of damage caused by frost, but he had just heard that It was 5,638,000 bales.    The prospects for the new jute crop were good; there had been ample rain in Bengal in the middle of April, with excellent results for the germination of the new crop and for the growth of the young plants.    It was anticipated that the area sown would be larger than last year and, consequently, prices of raw jute had been falling.&apos;Some anxiety had arisen in the Indian tea trade regarding the remission of the duty and the consequent loss of the preference on tea of 2/3&amp;.    This would undoubtedly mean greater competition in the coarser grades of Indian tea,    There was no anxiety about the higher grades, but in the present year it was anticipated there would be a larger crop,  including a good proportion of the lower grade teas, and some of the trade were a little despondent. Opinion, however, was fairly evenly divided, and a large section thought that what was lost on the cheaper teas would be made up on the good.    Although it might be argued that there would be in-creased consumption, it was felt that consumption was already so high in England that there was not room for much expansion.The Government of India had recently published their scheme for an enquiry into banking in all its    aspects.    They hoped to bring under review the financing of internal as well as external trade.    Similarly, they hoped to consider the financing of the small as well as tho large organised industries, and in particular to secure more ample credit facilities for the greatest industry of all in India, agriculture.    They desired to encourage the banking habit,  and to improve banking education.    Committees would be appointed, in each Province to explore local conditions, and there would be a central committee to co-ordinate the labours of the Provincial committees,    At the final stage they proposed to call in outside experts to advise the central committee.    In view of the geographical extent of India and its varying conditions, the enquiry was bound to be complicated and lengthy, but the Government of India considered that such an enquiry was a necessary preliminary to any agreed scheme for a Central or Reserve Bank.COLONIAL TRADE.MR. VERNON stated that the exports of rubber from Malaya for the first three months of this year were 150,000 tons&apos; compared with 84,000 tons for the corresponding period of last year. That was an increase of 7 5 per cent.       Generally speaking,
COLONIAL TBADL  (CONTD.)It seemed that the rubber Industry in Malaya had quite satisfactorily faced the conditions-resulting from the abolition of restriction.    There was also a considerable inorease for the month of March as compared with the previous month, in the export of tin from Malaya.The exports of cocoa from Trinidad had in 1928 reached a higher figure in volume than they &quot;had&quot; ever reached, but in value they had gone down a little.    The most important feature in Trinidad had been the progress made by the oil industry? production had risen to a maximum figure in 1928, which placed Trinidad at the head of the list of oil producing countries within the British Empire, in front even of Burma,    There was also a record export of sugar in 1928, but at the present time it could not be produced except at a loss, and the situation, both in the West Indies and in Mauritius, was exceedingly berious.SOUTH AMERICAN TRADE.THE PRESIDENT announced, as a matter which was at present very confidential, that the Government was proposing; to send a small economic mission to the Argentine.    It would be under Lord D!Abernon, who, as a great diplomat and sportsman and with his knowledge of commerce and finance, would be an ideal leader, and he would have with him three others representing the engineering, textile and iron and steel industries. Until the formal approval of President Irigoyen had been obtained, however, nothing could be said about the mission.MR. HOSE welcomed the President^ announcement as to the mission which he had himself suggested some time ago.The position in the Argentine had improved, and the crops for the past year were larger in quantity and of lowor value, with a total value this year to about the same as last.   A distinct change had recently occurred in Argentine monetary conditions,   aioney had previously been in superabundant supply, but with the advance in the bank rate in London, the movement of the cereal crops had been to a large extent financed on the other side, and, at the present time Inoreased stringency was in evidence.    There had been some discussion regarding the possibility of an Argentine Government loan being negotiated abroad, but any such project appeared to have been shelved in favour of an internal issue.    It remained to be seen whether the resources of the Buenos Aires money market would be adequate, if the contemplated programme of public works was to be carried out in the early future.Trading conditions in Uruguay continued generally satisfactory.With regard to Chile, a commission was coming over here, which would get intercommunication with those concerned with synthetic nitrate, with a view to making some arrangement. He believed both parties would welcome an engagement.    In the
 i *j oSOUTHiAMERICAN TRADE (CONTD.).Si &apos;meantime, the position of the market was suffiolent to enable-many of the Chilean companies to make some money.    On the other hand it was rather disconcerting that a company &quot;which, a little while ago was ordered by the Chilean Government to put up some new ofioinas, could not get the necessary money in England, and went to America and got a fusion &quot;with Guggenheims, which brought them up to something between 25$ and 30^*    The policy of concentration was not altogether unsatisfactory from some points of view, but it was unfortunate, in this instance, that the money could not have been found in England.&apos;   A large quantity of capital in the industry was, however, held in this oountry.The Government of Erazi.l had decided to oreate a Central Bank.    Brazil was to be&quot;congratulated if they got this Central Bank, as it would help them very much in their present financial predicament.
CONFIDENTIAL. APPENDIX.HOURS OF LABOUR IN THE FINE COTTON SPINNING INDUSTRY OF THE UNITED STATES.(Note by Board of Trade and Ministry of Labour).1. The, spinning of fine yarns is  carried on mainly In the older cotton manufacturing areas of New England and the Atlantic Seaboard, but to an increasing extent also in the cotton growing states of the South.    In his &quot;Report on the 1928 Journey through U.S.A.&quot;   Mr. Arno Pearae, General Secretary of the International Federation of Master Cotton Spinners&apos; and Manufacturers&apos; Associations,  states that &quot;whilst ten years ago hardly any fine counts  (above 60&apos;s) were produced in the South of U.S.A.,  conditions are changing and 80&apos;s and 100&apos;s are getting quite an ordinary count.      In one mill I saw 120&apos;s being spun on a ring frame,  and 130&apos;s were being produced in Gastonia, N. C. 112.  In the older cotton manufacturing states, hours of labour in the cotton mills are as a rule shorter than in the Southern States, and this may be illustrated by the following examples relating to legal working hours for women, quoted by Mr. Pearse on the authority of the United States Department of Labour.    In only a few States does it appear that restrictions are enacted regarding the working hours of men, but where men and women are both employed,  the working hours of the men are doubtless as a rule limited by those of the women.Women.&apos;s hours of work.Maine.........Massachusetts.

While In the principal cotton manufacturing States of New England and the Atlantic Seaboard, weekly hours range from 48 to 55, in the five chief manufacturing States of the South the lowest figure is 55, 60 hours Is the legal limit in North Carolina, Georgia and Virginia, and in Alabama there Is no legal limitation of hours at all.4. In an article published in the &quot;Monthly Labour Review&quot; (the official journal of the United States Department of Labour) for October,  1928,  some of the results of an enquiry into wages and hours of labour at 158 representative cotton&apos;
APPENDIX (CONTD. ) .mills in 11 States are summarized.    Statistics are given which show^that the average full-time weekly hours in the spring of 1S2S were as follows :-State.	Male	s.	Females.			1	54.	0		7	47.	9		1	52.	2		9	50.	7		6	48.	4		9	53.	3		8	55.	8		0	55 c	0		2	56.	0		0	55.	0		2	55.	15. As regards North Carolina, which appears to be the principal centre of the fine spinning industry in the South, it was stated in the present year by two witnesses at the U.S. Tariff Readjustment hearings that the hours normally worked are 55, but &quot;there may be some mills in North Carolina under special arrangement that work 60 hours.&quot;6. The factory legislation of the various States does not restrict working to a single shift (though some States, e.g. Massachusetts, prohibit night work for women): and, where a second shift is worked,  the machinery might of course be in operation double the hours stated.7. No exact information is available as to prevalence of a two shift system.    In the Report previously referred to, Mr. Pearse writes&quot;I was told at the Cotton Textile Institute that night work was going out of favour,  and there are rumours that some States in the South are going to legislate against it; but particularly in the South, I found many mill men in favour of night work, and most of the mills which I visited were running at night.    As all the mills have their villages to house the operatives for double shifts, it is not likely that we shall see soon the abolition &quot;of night work in the South&quot;.8. On the basis of official returns of active spindles and active spindle hours,  the period of activity of the machinery during the twelve months ending July 1927 averaged about 12f hours per day in the cotton-growing States,  compared with slightly under 8 hours per day in all other States.    These figures, however,  are minimum figures, since the data regarding active spindles in each month relate as a rule not to the average number of spindles operated during the month, but to the total number which have at any time been in operation during the month.9.    It may be added that the published results of an enquiry made by the United States Department of Labour in 1926 Included some particulars as to the hours of labour on
APPENDIX  (CONTD.).day-work and night-work respectively, at 151 cotton mills in 12 States.    These particulars are summarised below%-State.Day Work.Number of Mills.Full-timeHours per week.Night Work.Number of Mills.Full-timeHours per week.Maine.........Massachusetts.

It would appear from these figures that the States in which night shifts are most frequently operated are North and South Carolina, Georgia, and Alabama.    It is not definitely stated In the Report on the Enquiry whether the numbers of mills shown under the heading &quot;night work&quot; were actually working two shifts In 1926, but it would appear that in those 4 States combined 37 mills out of a total of 90 covered by the Enquiry were sufficiently accustomed to work at night to bs able to give particulars of the recognised full-time night work hours, whereas in the other 8 States only 6 mills out of a total of 61 gave any particulars as to night work hours.11. The root of the trouble lies in the fact that in the South, where till recently there had been little or no manu-facturing Industry, wage levels are much lower than in the North.    Indeed it is largely because of this that mill owners
APPENDIX (8QKTD),have been moving their mills of late years down to the South where the &quot;poor whites&quot; who had hitherto been working out poor--existences on poor farms were at first only too happy to seek employment in the mills at wages much lower than those in force   in the prosperous and industrial North.    So great, in fact, was the difference in wages, that real estate companies offering factory sites in the South have been in the habit of including in their advertisements comparative state-ments of the cost of labour in their districts and in the industrial North.    The result has been, not unnaturally, that labour in the South feels now that it is being unjustly exploited, and that labour In the North feels that its own prosperity is seriously menaced by this undercutting and that it is highly important that labour in. the South should be efficiently organised for competitive bargaining and wages in the   South brought up to the same level as prevails in the North. ,12.   The problem involves -also a further Issue which was explained recently by Mr, Davis, Secretary of Labour, who pointed out that if wages in the South were not brought up to the prevailing high level of the North, and the tendency to shift factories from the North to the South consequently continues, wages in the North and everywhere in the United States will be forced down to the same level as in the poor South.   The result would be a severe blow at the purchasing capacity of the American internal market and American prosperity would be very seriously menaced.13,   The American Federation of Labour is talcing a keen interest In the problem and has been sending labour -organisers to the South; two of these, were recently kidnapped at Elizabethton In Tennessee by gangs said to consist of business men and real estate agents, and were warned not. to return to the district under pain.of death.    This incident has been accorded very considerable publicity by the press.May, 1929
