SECEET. Copy No.     28CP. 150 (29).CABINET.ADEN PROTECTORATE: RELATIONS WITH TRIBES.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.THE tribal affairs of the Aden Hinterland were last before the Cabinet in the summer of 1927 (see Cabinet Paper No. 231 (27)).Since then the situation has been materially altered by the transfer of control over Protectorate affairs from the Government of India to the Colonial Office, and by the appointment for the first time of a Resident at Aden not drawn from the Indian Army. Further, thanks to the successful operations of the R.A.F., the Imam of Sanaa has been expelled from the portions of the Protectorate upon which he had so long encroached.The new Resident (Sir Stewart Symes) lost little time in applying himself to the problem of the Protectorate. I attach, for the information of my colleagues, the correspondence that has passed between him and myself upon the subject. I think that this correspondence explains itself. It shows that Sir S. Symes has tackled the question on practical lines and has inaugurated a policy which, it is to be hoped, may place our relations with the tribes on a more satisfactory footing and may lead in due course to a material reduction of our commitments. I have conveyed to Sir S. Symes my general approval of the steps that he has taken. I propose to accord him my full support, as may from time to time be required, in carrying out the policy upon which he has embarked.L. S. A.Colonial Office, May 24, 1929.I.Despatch from the Resident, Aden, to the Secretary of State for the Colonies. (No. 14.   Secret.)Sir, The Residency, Aden, January 30, 1929.I HAVE the honour to submit that the time is ripe for consideration by His Majesty&apos;s Government of a constructive policy for the Aden Protectorate and our relations with its Chiefs. That the problem is essentially more an Imperial and Arab than an Indian concern has been recognized by transfer of control of Protectorate affairs to the Colonial Office. Nevertheless, the existence of the Protectorate has hitherto been regarded as essential to the security of Aden Settle-ment, which remains legally a part of British India and administratively under the Bombay Presidency. Where Imperial and Indian interests are so closely interwoven, and not always identical, as at Aden, I have apprehended that their proper recon-ciliation may be complicated if, at a future date, the Provincial (Bombay) Government were to be given a largely increased measure of autonomy. With this contingency in mind, and also for administrative convenience, I have suggested to the Government of India the desirability of making the Aden Settlement a local Government with a separate budget, and dependent from the Central Government at Delhi.[19342] bv , -Printed for the Cabinet.

2. In any case, while Aden retains importance as a fuelling base and port of transit and I see no immediate reason for its decline its security from attack by land and relations with the interior are matters of vital concern. The purposes for which the Protectorate was instituted were : (1.) To interpose a barrier, or neutral zone of friendly tribes, between the Yemenand Aden Settlement. (2.) A point d&apos;appui for commercial and other relations with South-WestArabia.(3.) An insurance against occupation by a Foreign Power of ports or coastal tracts near the main line of our marine communications.3. Before considering the extent to which these purposes are being, or are still required to be, achieved, it will be relevant to describe very briefly the origin and circumstances of the existing Protectorate system.In 1728, the Governor of Lahej of the Shafei sect threw off all allegiance to the Zeidi Imamate in the Yemen, seized Aden and became independent in alliance with the neighbouring (Shafei) tribes. In 1839, when the British occupied Aden, a treaty made with the Abdali Sultan of Lahej stipulated that His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment should pay the stipends previously made by the Sultan to the Fadhli, Yafai, Haushabi and Amiri tribal chiefs in order to secure their goodwill. This was the beginning of the system of treaties which has provided the fabric of our Protectorate. Subsequently, some 30 separate treaties were made with local chiefs, whereby, in return for &quot; gracious favour and protection &quot; and a fixed stipend, a chief engaged neither to have relations with nor to alienate territory to a foreign Power. Five of these treaties impose the further obligation on a chief to protect trade routes in his territory.The zone within which British influence was more immediately felt may be said to be comprised by a semi-circle having a radius of about eighty miles with the Aden peninsula for its centre. In this zone are included the territorial districts of the tribes and tribal groups quoted in the previous paragraph. Beyond the zone to the east and in the Hadramaut, but especially on the seacoast, Great Britain was regarded as a kind of paramount Power which, while recognising Home Rule, yet was ready to prevent alienation of territory to foreign nations and inter-tribal disputes which threatened the public peace and commerce. The district of Behan, one of whose chiefs is in treaty relations with us, is isolated to the north-east of the zone.   Sokotra island is 300 miles distant by sea from Aden.4. Prior to the war British influence in the Protectorate was rarely exerted by force. Usually we relied on grants of stipends and presents of arms and money to the more authoritative chiefs to promote our occasional interventions on behalf of public security and neighbourly relations. Our practice in this respect at times came near to indiscriminate buying off potential public nuisances, as witness a list of annual &quot;presents and entertainment &quot; received by 100 heads of families in the small but troublesome Subehi tribe. Nevertheless, treaty relations with the chiefs were maintained, and the boundary of our Protectorate as delineated with the Turks in 1904 was kept inviolate until the war, when the Turks over-ran the greater part of the zone referred to above. Zeidi soldiers of the Imam, who occupied a lesser part afterwards, were ejected mainly by Air operations last July.5. In either a geographical or an ethnological sense the Protectorate is an artificial institution. Its boundary with the Yemen follows minor tribal divisions, and separates a minority of the Snafei a Sunni sect of Islam--from the majority of their fellows, who pay unwilling allegiance to the Zeidi (Shia) Imam at Sanaa. The Imam regards its existence as being detrimental to his prestige as a Moslem ruler, and also prejudicial to a satisfactory settlement of his Shafei problem in the Yemen. He suspects us of deliberate encouragement of Shafei opposition to his rule, especially among the chiefs of the Red Sea littoral. His sense of grievance is aggravated by knowledge that we neither tax nor administer our proteges. His hostility is a permanent and important factor in the situation.6. We have thus been required to deal with the problems of a congeries of tribes and sub-tribes, several uncertain tribal confederations, and of two districts onIy the Sultanates of Lahej andMokalla (Hadramaut) which present the semblance of an orderly native State. The tribesmen for the most part are wild, intensely conservative and used to modern firearms. The authority exercised by their chiefs is local and often precarious. Even a British officer travelling on duty las usually to obtain permission to enter a tribal territory, and is expected to make
presents in cash, for the most&quot; trifling assistance he may receive. In these circum-stances the continuance of a policy of aloof indifference diluted with bribes will be difficult, and the success of our endeavours by diplomacy and, on occasion, Air force to ensure quiet if no progress or trade development in our Protectorate seems very problematical. It is, I consider, essential to decide on our future policy,, and to begin its execution at a time when, by the tardy fulfilment of our treaty obligation Jdf protection, our prestige is higher than it was and other local circumstances are not unfavourable.7. A possible policy, in view of the growth of the Arab National Movement and the emergence of an independent Yemen State, would be to renounce our Pro-tectorate over the greater part of the territory and leave the inhabitants to the not very tender mercy of the Zeidi ruler. However satisfactory the effect on our immediate relations with the Imam, the inevitable consequence of this would be to make enemies of tribesmen who are now passively our friends and to leave them to a Government which is, I think, incapable, so far away from its centre, of preventing their enmity finding constant expression in interference with trading caravans and other aggressive acts against us. A more serious objection is that it would be a flagrant violation of our treaty engagements with the chiefs and prejudicial to our good name and prestige in S.W. Arabia. Similar objections can be urged against any considerable modification of the present boundary with the Yemen.Another possible course would be to introduce a simple form of direct adminis-tration of the Protectorate or of such parts in the vicinity of Aden as may be required for the protection from sudden attack of the Air base and settlement. I feel sure that this Would impair, if it did not altogether destroy, two of the more solid bases of our Protectorate system, viz. : Home Rule and no taxation. It would certainly prove costly in view of the unproductive nature of the country, and troublesome on account of the unruly character of the inhabitants. I do not recom-mend it.8. My view of the situation is briefly this. If we are to remain securely at Aden as of right and not on sufferance by an Arab ruler, a friendly hinterland in which our political influence will be paramount is necessary. The Protectorate comprises all perhaps more than  the hinterland required, and provided it could be given a suitable political system would adequately fulfil the three purposes quoted in paragraph 2 of this despatch. If we decide to maintain our Protectorate, the main problem will be how to promote such cohesion among the tribes as will enable them, with such assistance as we can afford, to present a common front against Zeidi aggression and for the better organisation of the territory. The solution of this problem must, I think, be sought along native and, as there is no local family which possesses attributes of sovereignty, federal lines. Its approach is bound to be slow, but can be facilitated by a policy of giving consistent support to those para-mount chiefs who, in our opinion, are necessary for the proper ordering of the tribes, and by encouraging them to enter into closer relations with each other and with us. By these relations may be cultivated the sense of common interest and spirit of mutual confidence which could provide the basis for more regular and effective co-operation. It is noteworthy that in Baluchistan, where local traditions are not very dissimilar, the method of government by Jirga, or tribal councils, has given good results; and I conceive that it may be possible eventually to constitute in this Protec-. tor ate one or more Chiefs&apos; councils to be the central authority for the settlement by arbitration and otherwise of tribal affairs and to become the principal and native  instrument of our political direction. We have a valuable agent for the promotion of such a policy in the present Sultan of Lahej, who by his hereditary position, personal qualities and proven loyalty is well fitted to preside, as pi-imus inter pares, over any Council that may be assembled. I think that the consummation of a policy of this kind would not necessarily preclude, and might even increase, the likelihood of a future amicable settlement of the frontier and other questions now at issue between us and the Imam of the Yemen.9. The effect of the policy on our treaty arrangements would require considera-tion. Circumstances have changed since the treaties were made. But it was felt that revision of them could not be undertaken while Turks and Zeidis were in occupation of tribal lands and also that considerations other than mere expediency should not be ignored. We have for our own purposes encouraged political separation of these tribes from the Yemen and it would not be right to withdraw our protection without first giving them an opportunity to organize for the maintenance of the independent status they profess to desire, but, in many instances, have done little to ensue. If, [19342] b 2
however, tribal chiefs could successfully combine to form a native organ for the control of Protectorate affairs a single treaty imposing a collective guarantee might replace the present separate engagements. If not, we should consider ourselves free, after due notice had been given, to annul or amend the existing treaties in accordance with our needs. It is probable that knowledge of our intention in this respect would be a further incentive to the chiefs to become amenable to our policy and requirements of them.10. I intend in the latter half of March to convoke a meeting of as many as possible of the leading chiefs in order to make their acquaintance and confer with them collectively as to tribal dispositions for defence of the territory against any renewal of aggression from the Yemen. This meeting, which would be almost the first of its kind, will probably take place at Lahej, and would provide a suitable occasion to discuss Protectorate affairs in general and to make discreet inquiry as to the extent of co-operation in an elementary organization that may be expected from individual chiefs, and also as to the federal system which might be evolved in the near future.Before I embark on an inquiry of this sort I should be grateful to receive, if possible by telegraph, your sanction and general observations on the tentative policy for the retention of the Protectorate and a better organization of the territory which I have outlined in this despatch.I have, &amp;c.

I sanction discussion with leading chiefs and discreet and tentative enquiries as suggested in your despatch No. 14 of the 30th January. Despatch follows.III.Despatch from the Secretary of State for the Colonies to the Resident, Aden.Sir, Downing Street, March 21, 1929.I HAVE given careful consideration to the views which you expressed in your Secret despatch No. 14 of the 30th January as to the policy to be pursued in regard to the Aden Protectorate and the relations between His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Protectorate tribes.2. I have already sanctioned, by telegram, the suggested discussion with the leading chiefs of the Protectorate and the discreet and tentative enquiries which you then intend to make. The constructive policy outlined in your despatch is, in my opinion, deserving of the fullest encouragement, but, as you will observe from the accompanying copy of a lettert from the India Office on the subject, the Secretary of State for India desires that the Government of India should be afforded an opportunity to consider the correspondence before general approval is given to the scheme. I will address you further on the matter when it has been ascertained whether the Government of India have any observations to offer in the matter. In the meantime I would merely draw your attention to the comments made in the India Office letter and to those made in the Air Ministry letterl on the subject, copies of which are enclosed. A copy of the Air Ministry letter of the 22nd January, regard-ing the payments made to the chiefs of the Protectorate, accompanied my Secret despatch of the 31st January.I have, &amp;c. (Signed) L.

Despatch from the Resident, Aden, to the Secretary of State for the Colonies. (No. 57.)Sir, The Residency, Aden, April 10, 1929.I HAVE^the honour to report that, at my suggestion, the Sultan of Lahej issued invitations to a number of the leading chiefs of this Protectorate to assemble and confer at Lahej between the 1st and 7th instants. His Highness&apos;s invitation was accepted by the following : The Upper Yafa Sultan and his father.The Naqibs of the Mausatta, and the Hadhrami, Dhubi and MuflahiSheikhs, all of Upper Yafa. The Lower Yafa Sultan. The Padhli Sultan. The Haushabi Sultan. The Amir of Dhala. The Lower Aulaqi Sultan. The Qotaibi Sheikh. The Alawi Sheikh.2. I opened the conference ceremoniously at the Sultan&apos;s Palace on the morning of the 1st instant, and represented to the assembled chiefs the need for unity and co-operation between them in order to withstand Zeidi penetration and for the better rorganisation of the territory. I said that the degree of assistance they could expect in the future would depend on evidences of their desire and capacity to make a good use of the independence which was secured to them by the Protection of His Majesty&apos;s Government, and suggested the desirability of a formal statement of their good intentions. The matter was subsequently discussed by the chiefs among themselves and also at a further meeting with me, at which I was asked for and gave-assurance that their signature of a pact or statement of this kind would not eo facto invalidate their individual treaties with His Majesty&apos;s Government. Agree-ment on the principle and formula was reached eventually, and a pact of which the English version is attached was signed by each chief in my presence on the afternoon of the 6th instant.3. Opportunities were taken during the week to discuss with the chiefs arrangements for their co-operation, collectively and individually, in a simple frontier defence scheme, and also for arbitration by the Sultan of Lahej in respect of certain inter-tribal disputes which have prevented peaceful development of cultivable lands in the Abian region between the Yafa and Fadhli tribal districts.4. The proceedings were generally harmonious, and the assembly, besides promoting a better understanding between individual chiefs, has, I think, led to a clearer realization by them that existing treaties involve obligations as well as benefits, and that cohesion between the tribes is a common interest.The presence at Lahej of a number of the Subeihi chiefs who lately submitted, but who were excluded from the meetings and social gatherings, afforded mute but tangible evidence of the ability of Government in case of need to assert authority by other means than arguments.5. The arrangements made by the Sultan of Lahej for conference and hospital^ were excellent, and His Highnesses personal ascendancy with his fellow-chiefs was shown on several occasions.I have, &amp;c.
