[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty^ Government.] Printed for the Cabinet.   April 1929.SECRET. Copy No.     ^QCP. 107 (29).CABINET.NAVAL LIMITATION.f Circulated to the Cabinet by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.](1)Sir E. Howard to Sir Austen Chamberlain. (Received April 5.)(No. 170.)(Telegraphic.) Washington, April 4, 1929.MY telegram No. 159.Secretary of State to-day handed me memorandum in reply to one which I left with Mr. Castle on 28th March. It stated that United States Government appreciates candour with which British Government has set forth its views on slight prospect achievement at next meeting of preparatory commission and desire of British Government to secure some result. United States Government cordially agree that progress towards settlement of naval question would be more probable if preceded by consultation between the two Powers, and United States Government would be most happy to examine in a friendly spirit any proposals which Great Britain may put forward.As British Embassy&apos;s memorandum stated certain Powers have always insisted on concurrent treatment of land, naval and air limitation. It therefore seems impossible to avoid discussion of naval question without risking impression that naval Powers are preventing discussion of entire problem. Also obvious that time before meeting of commission is rather short for discussion between the two Governments. Memorandum of British Embassy states that purpose of preparatory commission is &quot;to elaborate a convention which would in practice amount only to an agreement of signatory Powers not to exceed certain maximum limitation which would be fixed by each for themselves.&quot; United States Government understood purpose of commission to be agreement of method of limitation and preparation of draft treaty, which would serve as frame work for ultimate quantitive limitation and reduction to be agreed on later by plenary conference. In other words, preparatory commission was not authorised to deal with quantitive proposal. Commission made up of limited number of Powers and its decisions must receive approval of numerous others before agreement may be reached. United States Government, therefore, does not entirely understand suggested proposal that each nation be asked to submit its own programme in the hope that these separate programmes might eventually be assembled and embodied in convention binding on signatories not to exceed them. Such proposal would seem to call for material modification of functions of commission. Quite true that this technical aspect of competence of preparatory commission should not be permitted to interfere with ultimate agreement amongst naval Powers, but, on the other hand, this proposal so completely alters character of work of commission, that United States Government doubts whether it would receive general assent.Furthermore, it does not appear that suggested change would constitute advance in limitation and reduction of armaments. Building programmes of naval Powers are generally published, and mere statement that such programmes would not go beyond agreement to perpetuate existing armaments and projected increases which is hardly useful achievement in cause of limitation and reduction.4834   [19104]
United States Government sincerely hope that some progress towards agree-ment on method may be made in the course of forthcoming meeting. On the other hand, if agreement even of this nature cannot be reached United States Government believe that ultimate agreement would rather be advanced by a clear statement of reasons for failure than by an expedient that might disappoint hopes of effective reduction and limitation.If meeting of commission takes place the 15th April there will obviously be no time for discussion beforehand with British Government.United States Government, however, welcomes friendly spirit exhibited by Great Britain in its memorandum and will at all times be disposed to examine in a friendly spirit any suggestions that latter Government may care to advance as a basis for discussion.Mindful of instructions in your telegram No. 171, I made no comment on this beyond saying that I would at once inform you of its contents.Secretary of State then asked why His Majesty&apos;s Government wished to avoid naval limitation discussion at Geneva. I said I had no information on this point and could only make a guess, as I thought it would be better to avoid anything in the nature of further public discussion until our two Governments had had some private discussion. He then said that what United States Government wanted to see was not limitation of armaments to their present size or to projected increase, but a rigid economy. I said I felt sure that His Majesty&apos;s Government were in agree-ment with this aim if it could be attained, but a limitation to status quo might serve as a pis oiler, giving us time to consider further reductions later.Copy of memorandum goes by bag to-morrow7.(2.)Sir Austen Chamberlain to Sir E. Howard (Washington).(No. 191.)(Telegraphic.) Foreign Office, April 8. 1929.YOUR telegram No. 170 of 4th April.United States memorandum seems to show that United States Government have not fully understood our proposal. My telegram No. 180 will already have made it clear that we are not really proposing to enlarge functions of committee or to alter basis of its work. Committee has been trying to prepare framework of convention under which Governments would make estimate of their requirements for duration of convention in uniform tables or categories. As committee cannot, at present, agree on tables, it occurred to us that approximately the same result might be attained by making returns, even though these were not uniform. It is quite true that committee is not authorised to deal with &quot;quantitative proposal,&quot; and we did not mean to suggest that it should. It is, of course, also true that committee is composed only of limited number of Powers. But this limited committee is now trying to agree on formula for uniform returns, which it would ask Council to submit to Disarmament Conference as basis for its work. We merely propose that same committee, if forced to recognise difficulty of. securing completely uniform model for returns, should recommend Council to invite States to send in returns in their own way (though they could, of course, be based on the tables in so far as these are agreed).Our proposal was meant to be a short cut to the same result. We realise that the committee&apos;s convention, if attainable, would be more satisfactory, but we considered that, if agreement could not be reached, our short cut would be better than nothing, as it might at least put some check on competition in armaments, some symptoms of which can unfortunately be observed while committee continues its hitherto fruitless discussions.It is, of course, true that our proposal might not &apos;&apos; constitute advance in limitation and reduction,&quot; but it should at least achieve as much as the committee&apos;s draft convention, for under that convention each signatory will insert its own figures in the tables annexed to the convention. This is surely nothing more than announcing its programme, and undertaking to be bound by it. In any case we feel that this may prove the best way of preparing the ground for a pari passu reduction in the future.It is conceivable that, if given full latitude as to form in which they submit programmes, some Governments might produce them in very unsatisfactory or
incomplete form. That might render it impossible eventually to conclude convention. But they would be placed in very invidious position, and pressure of public opinion will make them anxious to show themselves in best possible light. , In any case, same difficulty might arise when Governments came to fill in tables under committee&apos;s convention.You rightly took line indicated in last sentence of your telegram. It is mainly with a view to achieving something practical without further loss of valuable time, rather than adjourn with nothing done, that His Majesty&apos;s Government have put forward idea. We did not, however, wish to propose it at committee unless we could be assured that United States Government would not oppose it. It might be difficult to resist demand for its application in naval as well as other spheres, and we were anxious not to complicate already difficult naval question by further unacceptable proposal.Discussion of naval problems on lines hitherto followed has led to point where, for our part, we do not see immediate prospect of issue (unless, possibly, United States Government were to think idea of programmes might pave way to solution), and that is why we were anxious to avoid public discussion at Geneva that might do no more than revive old controversies.We note the renewed expression of willingness of United States to consider any further proposal which we may be able to devise, but we are bound first to discuss such questions with the Dominions. Near approach of our own elections makes ii difficult to take final decisions at this moment. But we are most anxious to avoid further public discussion, and perhaps controversy, until there has been opportunity for full and confidential exchange of views between our two Governments.Please make reply to United States memorandum on lines of this telegram and of my telegram No. 180.I shall be glad to know whether, in view of the above explanations, we can count on American support or, at least, discount opposition.
