199 i   ^f!this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRIT AM IG MkJESTY&apos;S GOTEKKMBanE).SECRET.QoP, llljg2l&apos;--&apos; CAB IKE T.COMMITTED ON SUGAR PREFERENCE DUTY. REPORT.1. At their Meeting on April 10th 1929  (Cabinet 15(29)Conclusion 3) the Cabinet considered the question of theserious effect of the fall in sugar prices on certain british sugar producing Colonies, and agreed. tha&quot;5 aCommittee composed of -The President of the Board of Trade(In the Chair). The Secretary of State for Scotland The Minister of Health The Minister of Isabour,-should meet with the Secretary of State for the Colonies, the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries,, and the Chairman- of the Board of Customs and Excise, for the purpose of oonsidoring and advising the Cabinet whether the emergeney in the Colonies was suoh as to render it desirable to give in the forthcoming Budget an increased measure of Imperial Preference on SugarOn 11th April, 1929, the Chairman made a preliminaryverbal report to the Cabinet in regard to the conclusions reached by the Committee, and undertook to circulate thepresent Report in due course (Cabinet 16(29) Conclusion 3)).&apos;2o The existing rates of Imperial Preference an Sugar were,settled in 1928 after prolonged negotiations with the Interests concerned, those interests must be ccnsu.lted before the existing arrangements are modified and it would clearly have bGen quite impossible In the two or three d&amp;ya a-vailablo to have settled a new scheme and incorporated&quot;it in the First Finance Bill of 1929. If the Government decided-to increase the rate of preference and announced their decision some timeCOPY HO.&apos;
before its Parliamentary ratification, a most serious situation would result from clearance and other difficulties and there would &quot;be grave risk of shortage and rises of price.      In these circumstances we recommend that any announcement of the Government&apos;s decision be deferred until the time of the Intro-auction of the Second Finance Bill, after the General Election.30 The disastrous effects of the present sugar war on those British Colonies in which sugar production is the sole industry of any consequence arc set out in a Memorandum by the Colonial Office attached, hereto (Appendix     )6     Both in Mauritius and in tho West Indian Colonies sugar producers of all grades of efficiency are incurring very heavy losses * There is no indication that sugar prices will improve in the near future or that the undertakings in question can become more efficient, so long as the present depression lasts. The West Indian, proposal,, which we are Informed, would be acceptable to Mauritius, Is that the present preference should be increased by l/- per ewt0    This concession would not suffice to wipe out losses and would still leave the planters with a substantial inducement to improve their ur.dertaki.ugs and methods4c In liauritius it ha-&apos;-\ been necessary to land the planters 500^000 to finance the coming crop and In the absence  of any change cf circumstance, similar relief will have to be given next yeai-a    The largo fortunes: mads in the War have left the island and the local Development Fund Is already fully earmarked for other services..    If no action   im taken the planters TJill&quot; go baj-j.kru.pt and tho rest of the population 8Of0 cf which Is Indian.,will be destitute;, and will have to be relieved.on In the West ladies, B8.rtad.os, British Guiana.. Antiguaand Sto Kitts are mainly dependent on their sugar production,,
12ZIf nothing is lone the Imperial Government will have to assume financial responsibility for possibly 50f0 of the present expenditure of the Colonies and for the cost of famine relief.     Encouraged by local preference duties Great Britain exports annually goods of the value of about  6  million to the British West Indies, a figure which will shrink materially in the event of their bankruptcy.      If the increased preference is given this market and its potentialities will be kept alive.6.       We have reached the following conclusions on theinformation before U3(1) It appears certain in the case of^Mauritius and probably in the cases of Barbados   British Guiana and certain cf the smaller \7est Indian Islands that, if no action is taken, the British Government will before long have to make sttbstanti&amp;l grants for the maintenance of the Governments of those Colonies and . the relief of their inhabitants comparable with the grants in aid which would be necessary after some earthquake or other catastrophe.(2) Whatever the form cf f inane IsJL help now given, there must always be some risk that further assistance In other ways may have to be given later.(Z) The most economical and defensible expedient would seem to be a temporary increase In the sugar preference to enable the under-takings to remain at wort.     An. increase in the preference of l/- per cwto would, still leave the planters to bear some portion of their losses and they would thus have strong incto-agreement to add, to the efficiency of their under takings..7- Ihe increase in the preference could not of course be limited to these Colonies which need assistaiioe  but would have to be extended to the whole Empireo      The annual consumption in Great Britain of Empire produced sugar is about 700,000 tons of which approximately
 10,000 tons come from Colonies needing help fMauritius a:A tho West Indies) and the remainder (390.000 tons) from the British Isles  (Kciae grown bo-ssi),     Australia and Katal, which need no assistance.So       In the case of hose grown &quot;beet the increased prefer-enoe would, minimise the effect of the reduction in 1930 of the be*t sugar subsidy.      She additional l/- would represent about 2/Sd0 to 3/- a ton   of be.a&amp;3 the allocation of which between the be-&quot;it growers and the factories would be a natter for negotiation^9u It is estimated that the annual cost of increasingthe preference by I/- a ewte would be about  900,000; If the proposal took effect In July next the cost for 1929/30 would be rather more than  700,000*100       As a result of the arrangements reached in-1928 with the sugar interests, the importation of foreign refined sugar has greatly decreased and the British refiners are now only in competition with the home grown beet sugar and the 40$ of the Mauritius crop which Is sent home relinodc      It has been represented to us that the refiners will be against any change which will have the effect of depriving them of some of the benefits of the 1928 concordat and may indeed revive their opposition, to the be.et industry.    It seems to us. however,  that the position is now very different to that of a year ago when the scheme as a whole was being negotiated to some extent in the dark as regards its possible effects.--.      The consumption of home grown beet sugar and refined sugar from Mauritius together represents a very small fraction of the total British consumption and substantial develop-ment of the imports of such Maur.itius sugar could hardly&apos;4o .

Whitehall&apos;Gardens, S.Wolaffect the benefits which the refinex^s have gained, from the redaction of the Imports of foreign refined sugar.11. &quot;    We have requested the Chairman of the Board, of Customs and Excise to consider whether any objections which the refiners may be expected to raiso are likely to give rise to serious difficulty, and if so to advise whether any variation of the proposal would remove or minimise those objections.12a       While it is impossible to say whether the proposed increase of preference will effect its object, it will at ell events afford a solution for the time being aa.&amp; may con-tribute towards bringing about a settlement of the sxigar war. If given, the increase should be limited to a period not exceeding the duration of the present preference arrangements13o      We are satisfied that it would be impracticable to insist on the reformation of the sugar industry in the distressed Colonies as a condition of the increased prefer-ence.    It has been suggested that in the case of Mauritiussteps should be taken to create an efficient marketingorganisation.    The Secretary of State for the Colonies has agreed to make the strongest possible representations to theColony on ths subject., and to use the possible withholding of his sanction to future borrowing, as a lever.14o If the Cabinet appx^ove in principle our proposalfor an increase of l/- a cwt. in the preference on EmpireGrown sugar9 we recommend that negotiations should beundertaken with the Refiners and other interests cone erredforthwith.Signed on behalf of the Committee.P.

APPBHDIX.COMMITTEE. ON BUG-AH PBBpEREIJlOB DUTY.Memorandum prepared in Colonial pffiee for information of Chancellor&quot; of&quot; Exchequer&quot;.The sugar war now existing between the two great sugar producers,   Cuba and Java, has created such competition in the world market that the price of sugar has fallen to a level much below the cost of production,  except possibly in Java,      With a powerful financial organisation behind them the Cuban sugar producers are able to continue the struggle and are now stated to be selling at 9/3d. c.i.f. United ?Iingdom as against a cost of production of lo/ll-g-d f .o.b. This state of affairs has had serious repercussions upon the small British colonial producers who, not having the benefit of arx Internal market of their own with a high protective tariff,  are compelled to export all their produce. The market price for Mauritius white sugar is  12.10.Od.  a ton as against a cost of production which is stated to be about  14. 0. Od,        The price paid for Barbados sugar at the beginning of this year was  lie 4.  Od.  per ton as against a cost of production which is stated to be  12. 1-5.  Od. and since then the market has weakened.      On an estimated crop of 225,000 tons in Mauritius and 70,000 tons in Barbados,  the total loss to the planters during the forthcoming year is likely to amount to  237,500 and  108,500 respectively. The acuteness of the present crisis in Mauritius is shown by the fact that it has been found necessary to pay planters a bounty amounting to  500,000 in respeot of their last crop to enable them to purchase the manures,  sacks,  etc.,  necessary for the forthcoming crop.      In Barbados, where the estates are not large and for-the most part are held by individuals without the resources to enable them to stand a prolonged
financial strain,  a similar situation is rapidly approaching. Pressing appeals for assistance have been received from the Governments of Mauritius,  Barbados and British Guiana and on behalf of all the sugar producing Colonies in the West Indies from the recent Conference of all the Vvest Indian Colonies which net in Barbados at the end of January.The economic structure of the Colonies concerned accentuates the gravity of the crisis.      Mauritius and Barbados are islands with an area of 460,800 acres and 106,500 acres respectively.      Both are relatively thickly populated,  Mauritius with 400,000 and Barbados with 160,000 inhabitants.      Both are  cultivated up to the hilt and in both the area under cultivation is devoted almost entirely to sugar, which accounts for over 90^ of their exports.      In both Colonies efforts are being made to foster subsidiary Industries,  of which the most important are the aloe fibre in Mauritius and cotton in Barbados, but it must be many years before anything material can be effected in this direction. Practically the whole of the population of both islands are thus dependent for their livelihood on the continuance of the sugar industry, on which vast sums have been spent by way of capital expenditure on plant and machinery,  of which the British -vest Indies and British Guiana alone have imported over  1,000,000 worth between 192S and 1927.      In the absence of effective assistance or of an early or unforeseen Improvement in prioes,  these Colonies,  together with British Guiana, Antigua and St. Kitts,   are threatened, not only with disaster., but with economic extinction.
The difficulties of Mauritius have &quot;been materially increased by the change in the treatment .of preferential sugars made in last year&apos;s budget.     For many years, the -Mauritius manufacutrers have been making white sugar polarising over 99;&apos;-      Owing to the equipment of their factories, on which large sums of money are spent every year on machinery imported from the United Kingdom, coupled v/ith the constituency of the cane Juice in the Colony, the economic point in manufacturing raw sugar lies round about 99;% of polarisation.     Experience has shown that it is very difficult to ensure that sugar so manufactured will not exceed 99$ on delivery.    But under the present tariff, as amended last year, sugars pay the following customs duty :-lion Pref.Pref .exceeding 95Q but not exceeding 96D pays 8/l     4/4*8 per cwt.11 9gO        11 tt tt 97o        ,, Q/4 4/6.3        &quot; &quot;&quot; gyO     it        it n ggO     it -    8/7        4/7*7     &quot;       &quot;tt 980       ,, 1, it 99o       ,, 11/8 4/9.2        &quot; &quot;990 pays 11/8      5/lOd. &quot;It will be seen from this that, while the preferential duty on sugars not exceeding 99$ increases by only l-3rd per degree of polarisation, the increase on sugarsexceeding 99$ is l/0o8 pence.    Consequently, sugar exceeding99$. which is the type Mauritius has been manufacturing for years, is penalised by llo3 pence by the new (1928] tariff:Amount nayable on sugar exceeding 99$&quot; &quot; Tf     &quot;     not exceeding 99$Extra &quot; n      &quot;      exceeding 99$Deduct lijrd for the 1 extra degree as. ifthe above scale applied...............PENALTY suffered by sugar exceeding 99$In practice, however, owing to the great refining quality of the Mauritius sugar the actual loss is 9d. per cwt.
In these circumstances, the assistance which Mauritius requests is as follows :-That the preferential duty on sugar polarising over 9%fv should be 4/10 n 7 instead of 5/10 per ewt.It this is not practicable owing to the opposition of the refiners, then Mauritius would wish that the above increased preference should be given to such sugar if delivered to the refiners and not put on the market for consumption.Besides the above requests, Mauritius joins with the West Indies In the request which is formulated in the following paragraph.The situation in the West Indies differs in certain respects from that of -lauritius.    Manufacturing sugar polarising about 96$j they are not affected by the above change in the British tariff, and they also enjoy a preference from Ceinada amounting to one dollar per 100 lbs, of which Mauritius, for climatic reasons, is not able to avail herself.    in practice, however,, the amount of this preference which goes into the pockets of West  Indian producers is limited to the amount accorded in their only alternative market, that is to say, the United Kingdom, which amounts to 3/9d a cwt.      So fax&apos; as Barbados is concerned, it Is reckoned that a profit on the sale of the crop could be obtained only if West India sugar were admitted free of any duty to this country, but the Colony has not put forward any such extreme request.    It asks only for an increase of l/-d per cwt.  in the preference.
thus bringing the United Kingdom preference to the Canadian level, which,  the producers anticipate, would reduce their loss by about  50,000 and probably enable the industry to be carried on in the hope of better prices next year.It is,  of course,  realised that there are great difficulties in altering the customs tariff which was settled last year after prolonged discussion and deliberation.      But what are the alternatives?    It may be asked why,  if the British  sugar growing Colonies cannot survive without the injection of successive and increasing doses of preference,  the;/ should not be left to their economic fate like English agriculture when brought into competition with the prairie lands.    But the position of the British sugar Colonies cannot be treated solely from the economic point, of view.    If they go to the wall, His Majesty1 s Government are not likely to be allowed to forget their responsibility for the descendants of the slave population -which they imported to grow sugaro    How expensive those responsibllities may prove is shown by our experience in the opening years of the century, when a quarter of a million of Imperial money was spent in meeting the effects of foreign bounties on the West Indies alone.,      On a small so ale, Dominica,  at the moment,  is an example of the results on the, Imperial Exchequer which may be expected if,  owing to the failure of the principal crop, half the West Indies come on the dole.Apart from large grants-in-aid, the only alter-native is that of rationalisation,  including,  not merely amalgamation 2nd modernisation of the sugar industry itself, but the production of new
agricultural industries on a large scale and,  if necessary,  the transfer of surplus population to other Colonies where there is room for them.      Although these possibilities should certainly be explored,  they would require,  not only&quot;thorough investigation and mature consideration, but also substantial capital expenditure. The main problem in carrying out rationalisation will be financial rather than agricultural,,      It is much to be feared that private enterprise would not be forthcoming in tho present conditions and that, in the long-run, the problem will be too large to be solved without the assistance of Imperial credit.      The tine has hardly come to put this forward as a definite proposal and,  in any case,  it would be not an alternative but a supplement to the alternative policies of enabling the sugar industry to carry on by a alight increase in the rate of preference or of allowing it to collapse and accepting the conse-quencer,.,  that Is to say,  large scale grants-in-aid,
