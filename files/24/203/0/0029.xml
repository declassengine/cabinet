THIRD REPORT.I. INTRODUCTORY.At their meeting held on the 18th October, 1926 (Cabinet 58 (26), Conclusion 6), the Cabinet took note that, in accordance with the Second Report of the Select Committee of the House of Commons on Estimates (No. 119), recommending that more attention should be given to the co-ordination of Government research with a view to economy and efficiency, the Prime Minister had decided to ask the Committee of Civil Research to report under the following terms of reference : &quot; To consider the co-ordination of research work carried on by or under the Government, to report whether any further measures should be taken to prevent overlapping, to increase economy and efficiency, and to promote the application of the results obtained.&quot;2. The Prime Minister constituted the following Sub-Committee of the Committee of Civil Research to undertake this inquiry : The Right  Hon.  W.  G.   A.   Ormsby-Gore,  M.P.,  Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies (Chairman);Major W. E. Elliot, M.C., M.P., Under-Secretary of State for Scotland;Sir  Warren  Fisher,   G.C.B.,   G.C.V.O.,   Secretary  to  the Treasury;Sir George Barstow, K.C.B., Controller of Supply Services, Treasury;Sir Daniel Hall, K.C.B., F.R.S., Chief Scientific Adviser, Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries;Sir Frank Heath,  G.B.E., K.C.B., Secretary, Department of Scientific and Industrial Research;Sir Walter Fletcher, K.B.E., C.B., F.B.S., Secretary, Medical Research Council;Sir Robert Greig, M.C., Chairman, Board of Agriculture for Scotland;Mr. Vaughan Nash, C.B., C.V.O., Vice-Chairman, Develop-ment Commission;[18918]
II. ORGANISATION OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH.5. Responsibility for Agricultural Research in Great Britain is shared in varying degrees between the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, the Board of Agriculture for Scotland and the Development Commission. If it were desired to modify the existing arrangements the only way to do so would be by legislation. It is clear that no such legislation could be obtained in the life-time of the jjresent Parliament. In view of the pressure of Parliamentary business we feel difficulty in making any proposals that would involve early legislation.6. Our survey of the existing arrangements which we have set out in our First Report (C.R. (C) 24) has satisfied us that a need exists for the establishment by the Government of some body charged with the duty of considering the present develop-ments and needs of agricultural research not only in this country but also in the Empire in view of the connections that have been and are being established between the research organisations in thin country and-corresponding organisations overseas.7. Of equal importance and urgency is the establishment of an organisation dealing with agricultural research as a whole, which can consult, and co-operate with, the scientific organisations already existing under Government in other branches of science. We refer in particular to the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research and the Medical Research Council, both of which have represented to us the importance of such a liaison from their respective points of view. The co-ordination of Government activity in these several fields is, indeed, one of the principal problems referred to us. It would be unfortunate if no steps were taken for several years to set up a body to carry out the double functions referred to in this and the preceding paragraph.Mr.   A.   E.   Widdows,   C.B.,   Assistant   Under-Secretary  of State, War Office;Mr. F. E. Smith, C.B., C.B.E., D.Sc, F.B.S., Director of Scientific Research, Admiralty.Mr. H. E. Wimperis, C.B.E., Director of Scientific Research, Air Ministry.Mr. A. F. Hemming, C.B.E., Assistant Secretary to the Committee of Civil Research (Secretary to the Sub-Committee).3. In December 1(J27 we submitted our First and Second Reports. In our First Report (C.R. (C) 24) we endeavoured to draw a picture of the research organisation of Government in this country as it exists to-day. By direction of the Committee of Civil Research this Report was subsequently issued as a Stationery Office publication. In our Second Report (C.R. (II) 64) we submitted recommendations on various matters in which it seemed to us that some modification in existing practice would lead to better co-ordination of the scientific work of the Government. On that occasion we reserved for later considera-tion the question of the future organisation of agricultural research which forms the subject of our present Report.4. We have been greatly assisted in our task by the information regarding existing practice placed at our disposal by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, by the Board of Agriculture for Scotland, and by the Development Commission. In particular, we are indebted to the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries (Rt. Hon. Walter Guinness, D.S.O., M.P.). and to the then Permanent Secretary to the Ministry (Sir Francis Floud, K.C.B.), who attended one of our meetings for the purpose of giving the views of the Ministry on this important question.
8. For the reasons given above it is impossible at present to establish a permanent body, but there may actually be advantages in setting up in the first instance a temporary rather than a permanent organisation. Beginning in a small way such a body would be able to learn valuable lessons from its own experience, and at the end of the transitional period it would be in a position to offer instructive suggestions for the consideration of whatever body was then charged with determining the form of permanent organisation to be adopted for agricultural research. If His Majesty&apos;s Government decide to establish a temporary body such as we suggest, we think it important that care should be taken to avoid any action which would imply the continuance of the organisation at the end of the transitional period on the lines first adopted, or its development in any one particular direction. Accordingly, we consider that the temporary body should not be attached either to the Development Commission or to the Lord President of the Council, or jointly to the Minister of Agi-culture and Fisheries and the Secretary of State for Scotland. The suggestion which we put forward for considera-tion is that the Committee of Civil Research should appoint for this purpose an ad hoc Committee, the life of which should be definitely limited to the transitional period.9. Such a Committee would of necessity have no funds at its disposal, and it would have to rely on its recommendations, backed as they would be with high scientific authority, being of sufficient weight to secure that effect would be given to them in appropriate cases by the Departments concerned and by the Empire Marketing Board. We recommend that this Agricultural Research Committee of the Committee of Civil Research should be entrusted with the following functions : To consider and report on (a.) Matters of importance to agricultural science to which in their opinion the attention of the Government shall be drawn;(b.) Questions involving co-operation between the English and Scottish Departments of Agriculture and other Govern-ment Departments in the United Kingdom, especially the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research and the Medical Research Council;(c.) Questions involving co-operation between the Departments of Agriculture or Agricultural Research Institutes in this country with corresponding Departments or Institutes overseas;(d.) Specific problems referred to them.It is not our intention that the Departments concerned should necessarily refer to the Agricultural Research Committee questions affecting the normal development of, or the day-to-day research undertaken by, the existing Research Institutes. It will, however, be open to them to make such a reference in any case where they so desire, under sub-section (d) above.10. Problems of major importance would, we conceive, be dealt with in the first instance by the Agricultural Research Committee as a whole. In the case of many problems, the Committee will probably find it convenient to refer them to Sub-Committees.11. In the transitional scheme outlined above, we contem-plate that the Agricultural Research Committee- should not be charged with the consideration of matters connected with Forestry research, since responsibility for this is at present entrusted by statute to the Forestry Commission.. 12. The promotion of scientific research is now one of the major functions of the Ministers responsible to Parliament for[18918] b 2
Agriculture, and a large proportion of their votes are devoted to this subject. In fact, it is being increasingly recognised that in discoveries and application of science lie many of the main hopes of prosperity in the industry. It is therefore all important that Ministers themselves and their chief administrative officers should be regularly in contact with general scientific thought. This could be brought about in part by regular meetings of the proposed Agricultural Research Committee with the Parlia-mentary chiefs of the two departments. These meetings might take the form of the main Committee of Civil Research, consisting for this purpose of the Lord President of the Council, the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries, and the Secretary of State for Scotland, and the members of the Agricultural Research Committee. It may also be desirable that the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs and the Colonies should attend some of these meetings in view both of his responsibility for the Empire Marketing Board and of the growing importance of scientific work in connec-tion with agriculture in the Empire overseas. The value of such meetings would depend on their affording opportunities to the scientific members of the Agricultural Research Committee for bringing to the personal notice of Ministers matters to which on scientific grounds they attach importance. At these meetings scientific questions could be brought up not only on the initiative of Ministers but of the Agricultural Research Committee. But this is only one method of improving the liaison between science, policy, and administration, and we feel that every opportunity should increasingly be taken both by Ministerial chiefs and their administrative staff to establish contacts with such a scientific group as is proposed.13. If the Agricultural Research Committee is to prove an effective machine for the promotion of agricultural research it is important that it should be relatively small in size, so that each of its members may feel that he has a personal contribution to bring to its discussions. After careful consideration we recommend that the Committee should be constituted substantially on the model of the Medical Research Council, and should consist of eleven members, including the Chairman. In accordance with the normal practice of the Committee of Civil Research, the appointment of the Agricul-tural Research Committee would rest with the Lord President of the Council as Chairman of the Committee of Civil Research, after consultation with the Ministers primarily concerned, in this case the Minister of Agriculture and the Secretary of State for Scotland.14. We consider that the Chairman of the Agricultural Research Committee should be a man of affairs Independent of the Administration, not necessarily chosen for his scientific attainments, but able to present the needs of agricultural research.15. The members of the Agricultural Research Committee-should, in our view, be chosen on the following grounds. They should, above all, be of high scientific standing in one or other of the basic sciences underlying agricultural science and should be chosen for their qualities as good counsellors. They should not be appointed on any territorial or institutional basis.16. Agricultural research differs from medical research and industrial research in that almost all the leading workers are employed in one or other of the research stations financed by the Development Commission and the Departments of Agriculture. In these circumstances we consider that there is no objection that workers in the Institutes financed by Government should be eligible for appointment to the Agricultural Research Committee if they personally possess the qualities indicated in the preceding paragraph.17. It will be seen from the foregoing outline that we make no provision for the representation on the Agricultural Research Committee of any Department or Research Institute as such. As regards the Institutes, the Agricultural Research Committee
cannot fail to secure effective relations with them when considering problems falling within their scope. Further, in a case of inquiries conducted through Sub-Committees (paragraph&quot; 10 above) we have no doubt that officers of the Institutes concerned would be invited in suitable cases to serve on the Sub-Committees.^,18. If the Agricultural Research Committee ie to function effectively it will obviously require to maintain close and constant touch with the Ministry of Agriculture, the Department of Agriculture for Scotland and other Departments that may from time to time be concerned; and it will be for the Committee, in consultation with those Departments, to devise the best means of securing this object.19. The success won by the Advisory Council on Scientific and Industrial Research and by the Medical Research Council has no doubt depended largely on the extent to which the personnel of those bodies has commanded the confidence of the highest scientific opinion in this country. Under the existing constitution of both Councils the members are appointed by the Lord President of the Council &quot; after consultation with the President for the time being of the Royal Society.&quot; &quot;When the time comes to set up a permanent body to replace the Agricultural Research Committee we think that the same rule should be followed. As regards the Agricultural Research Committee, we realise that it would not be appropriate formally to apply such a rule to the appointment of a Cabinet Committee, but we think none the less that its chances of success would be enhanced if before making a final selection of its members, the Lord President were to consult informally with the President of the Royal Society.III.-SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS.20. For the convenience of the Committee of Civil Research we summarise our principal conclusions as follows : (i.) A need exists for the establishment by the Government of some body charged with the duty of-(a) considering the present development and needs ofagricultural research not only in this country but also in the Empire in view of the connections that have been, and ajre being, established between the research organisations in this country and corresponding organisations; over-seas;(b) consulting, and co-operating with, the scientificorganisations already existing under Government in other branches of science, e.g., the Depart-ment of Scientific and Industrial Research and the Medical Research Council (para. 7) ;(ii.) The establishment of a permanent organisation of the kind referred to in (i) above would involve modifications in the existing relations between the Ministry of Agrioultuve and Fisheries and the Department of Agri-culture for Scotland and the Development Commission (para. 5);(iii.) Such changes would involve legislation which, in view of the pressure of Parliamentary business, it would probably not be possible to obtain for some time (para. 5);
(iv.) It is desirable to set up some temporary body charged with the duties indicated in (i) above for the transitional period which must elapse before any permanent scheme involving legislation could be brought into effect (para. 8).21. In the light of the foregoing conclusions we submit the following recommendations for the consideration of the Committee of Civil Research :-(i.) That as a transitional measure the Committee of Civil Research should constitute a Committee, to be known as the Agricultural Research Committee, with the following functions: To consider and report on: (a.) Matters of importance to agricultural science to \vhich, in their opinion, the attention of the Government shall be drawn;(b.) Questions^ involving co-operation between the English and Scottish Departments of Agriculture and other Government Departments in the United Kingdom, especially the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research and the Medical Research Council;(c.) Questions involving co-operation between the Departments of Agriculture or Agricultural Research Institutes in this country with corresponding Departments or Institutes over-seas;(d.) Specific problems referred to them (para. 9).NOTE. It is not intended that the Departments concerned should necessarily refer to the Agricul-tural Research Committee questions affecting the normal development of, or the day-to-day research undertaken by, the existing Research Institutes, but that it should be open to them to make such a reference, in any case where they so desire, under sub-section (d) above.(ii.) That in addition to the ordinary meetings of the Agricultural Research Committee, arrangements should be made for regular meetings to be held by the Committee of Civil Research, consisting for this purpose of the Chairman (the Lord President of the Council), the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries, the Secretary of State for Scotland, and on occasions the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs and the Colonies, at which the members of the Agricultural Research Committee should be invited to be present (para. 12);(iii.) That the Agricultural Research Committee should consist of eleven members, including the Chairman (para. 13);(iv.) That the Chairman of the Agricultural Research Committee should be a man of affairs independent of the Administration, not necessarily chosen for his scientific attainments, but able to present the needs of agricultural research (para. 1$);
(v.) That the members of the Agricultural Research Committee should be men of high scientific standing in one or other of the basic sciences underlying agricultural science, and should be chosen for their qualities as good counsellors, and should not be appointed on any territorial or institutional basis (para. 15) ;(yi.) That members of the staff of State-aided Research Institutes (e.g., bodies financed by the Development Commission, &amp;c.) should be eligible for appointment as members of the Agricultural Research Committee if personally possessed of the qualities defined in (?) above (para. 16) ;(vii.) That the Agricultural Research Committee, when constituted, should maintain close and constant touch with the Ministry of Agriculture, the Department of Agriculture for Scotland, and other Departments that may from time to time be concerned, and in consulta-tion with those Departments should devise the best means of securing this object (para. 18).(Signed)      W.
