THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY CP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVSRNMENT*SECRET. CABINET.C.P.115(29). BATTERSEA   POWER    STATION.Memorandum by the Minister&apos; of Transport.A letter appeared in the Times of the 9th April, signed by Lord Dawson of Penn among others, expressing apprehensions as to the effect of fumes from the new power station which, with the consent of the Electricity Commissioners and the First Commissioner of Works, is now in process of erection at Battersea.     The letter will be found in Appendix 1,The faets In connection with the approval of this station are fully set out In a report by the Electricity Commissioners (Appendix II).I am assured that the problem of dealing with smoke and grit presents no difficulties and that fully efficient measures can and will be taken to prevent any harmful results from this cause. The present operation of the obsolete power station at Lots Road, Chelsea, is no indication of what will happen at the new Battersea Station, and I understand that in fact the steps now to be taken to modernise the Lots Road Station will procure a marked Improvement In the unsatisfactory method of consuming coal at present in use.As regards the emission of fumes, a problem exists of which I do not wish to minimise the importance.     The Power Company are under obligation to take the beat known precautions for preventing, so far as is reasonably practicable, the emission of oxides of sulphur and, with a view to complying with this obligation, the Company have for some time been employing Research Chemists.      I am informed that their experiments promise a solution.    Briefly, I understand that the fumes can be filtered through water and that the circum-stances of a power station are such as to make this process more practicable than it would be at ordinary industrial works,    I feel, however, that the public is entitled to the utmost protection that can be afforded and that the effioacy of the steps contemplated
by the Company should.be specially investigated and reported upon by those responsible for advising the Government.    I propose therefore that the Government Chemist end the Department cf Scientific and Industrial Research should be requested to examine the results already obtained by the Company, to keep in touch with the progress of the Company&apos;s investigation, and to report to and advise the Electricity Commissioners and the First Commissioner of Works in the matter.    I believe that this procedure will be acceptable both to the Coinmisb loners and to the Company, and I do not think that at this stage there is any ground for setting up a separate Committee to undertake investigations which can properly and conveniently be conducted     by   the Department of Scientific &amp; Industrial Research in conjunction with the Government Chemist.A parliamentary question is down for answer on Thursday next and I should be glad to have approval to the following reply:-Viscount Sandon,-   To ask the Minister of Transport, whether he will immediately refer the question of the complete elimination of sulphur fumes from the workings of electricity generating plants to some body for scientific investigation and research; and whether, in the meantime, he will insist on sites for such purposes being chosen with full regard to the public interest, especially in the case of Battersea, in view of the effect of such fumes on the fabric of the Houses of Parliament. Proposed Answer:-In approving sites for power stations regard is, of course, had to the public Interest and opportunity is given for the hearing of any representations made, and no site in the County of London can be approved without the consent of the Commissioners of Works.When consent was given to the erection of the Battersea Power Station which is now und reconstruction, an obligation y     was placed upon the London Power Company to take the best known precautions for the due consumption of smoke and for preventing so far as reasonably practicable the evolution of oxides of
-3-esulphur,    I am informed that, with a view to compliance with this obligation, the Company have been employing Research Chemists to work on the problem of the elimination of sulphur fumes, and have stated that satisfactory results have already been obtained in laboratory experiments.In view, however, of the public interests Involved, the Electricity Commissioners, with my approval, have asked the Government Chemist to examine these results and to keep in closo touch with the progress of the Company&apos;s investigation.     In conjunction with the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research he will advise the First Commissioner of Works and the Electricity Commissioners as to the measures necessary to be adopted to comply with the conditions on which consent has been given to the erection of the new st at Ion.W.A.
Sir,It appears to us that the schemes of the Central Electricity Board to erect super generating stations at Battersea and elsewhere in the midst of large towns have been framed without sufficient regard to the welfare of the community as a whole.We are particularly apprehensive in respect of the station at Battersea for the following reasons:-(1) The proposed concentration of coal combustion is on a scale unprecedented in this country, and experience at generating stations of similar character but on a much smaller scale with modern appliances eliminating smoke indicates that the emission of large quantities of sulphurous acid causes serious damage to vegetation, besides corroding stonework, ironwork, end other metals and injuriously affecting paintings, coloured fabrics, and the like. It has also been found that the modern methods of burning coal result in the discharge of large quantities of fine dust and grit, which are a serious inconvenience to surrounding residents.(2) In the case of Parnworth versus Manchester Corporation, recently decided in the Court of appeal, it was admitted that the Barton power station had caused serious damage to crops for a radius of at least one mile.    This on a daily consumption of some 500 tons as compared with a minimum daily consumption of 2,000 tons as now proposed at Battersea.(3) As the prevailing winds in London are south-west, the normal flow of fumes from a station at Battersea would take a line over the Tate Gallery, Lambeth Palace, St. James !s Park, Westminster Abbey, the Houses of Parliament, St.  Thomas&apos;s Hospital, Whitehall, the National Gallery, &amp;c. , while Battersea Park and Chelsea Royal Hospital are both close to the site of&apos;the proposed station.    The corrosion of the stonework of the Houses of Parliament is known to be due to sulphurous vapours: the fumes from Battersea will be far more corrosive than the present atmosphere.
(4) The riverside is especially susceptible to fog, and when such occurs a great concentration of sulphurous and carbonic acids will take place.    These acids (the fumes of which, apart from condensation, are heavier than air) would descend on the surrounding district to the serious detriment of health, vegetation, and buildings whether of 3tone or brick.(5) Consequently, it seems evident that a generating station of this magnitude should not be permitted in or close to a large town, unless sure provision is made for preventing the emission of these deleterious gases and for eliminating all dust and grit from flue gases.    It appears to be doubtful whether sure provision is at present contemplated or whether it is even economically possible on the Battersea site.(6) There is the further point to consider namely, that if such a station were erected and the damage that is anticipated took place, it is inevitable that injunctions would be sought or claims for damages put forward.    The promoters would, therefore, be faced with the possibility of closure, the certainty of expensive litigation, and the probability of having to face costly c ompe ns a t i on.(7) In Germany, where large scale electricity production is farther advanced than it is in this country, the general practice is to produce the current on the coalfields.    Current of high voltage is transmitted for as great a distance ae 300 miles, and in some cases the difficulty of carrying overhead cables through the outskirts of big cities is obviated by laying a cable in the river Rhine - an accoinmodation which could as readily be provided in the Thames.(8) With regard to London, there is no need to cope with any distance approaching 300 miles, because in East Kent, some 60 miles away, there is a coalfield ready at hand, where a generating station on the seaboard could be so placed that the
prevailing wind would take any fumes out to sea and where any damage done would at least be a minimum.    A further advantage of a generating station on a coalfield would be the avoidance of additional transport of coal and removal of ash at a centre already over-burdened with traffic.(9) With these considerations in view and, above all, the danger to our national treasures, to the health and comfort of the near by population and to the vegetation of our parks  and open spaces, it seems manifest that the present prolect is ill-advised, particularly as there are  alternatives which have technical and economic advantages.Fortunately little has yet been done on the Battersea site and, in view of the considerations set out above, we ask the Government to institute an immediate and searching inquiry Into the proposal from all points of view.Yours faithfully,C.3.

APPENDIX II. Electricity Cor.tm.issIon. Battersea Power Station. Memorandum by the Commissloners.The correspondence and articles which have recently appeared in the Times with reference to the Eattersea Power Station sanctioned&apos; last year by the Electricity Commissioners and Office of Works and now under oonstruotion, suggest that in view of the creation of a National transmission system under the 1926 Act and other modern developments, the need for power stations in the centre of Cities has disappeared, since it is possible to transmit the energy from distant sites, while on the other hand, their presence is objectionable owing to the emission of smoke, grit and fumes.While the National transmission system certainly gives greater latitude in the siting of new stations the transmission of heavy loads over long distance remains a relatively costly process and a site central to the load with good water and coal facilities is still very desirable.Other factors have of course to be considered and no generalisaticn applicable to all large Cities is possible.     From such information as the Commissioners have available the tendency in other capitals is to build new large stations in the suburbs, e.g. Issy on the Seine opposite the Bois de Boulogne, but the -large new Edison station in New York Is being erected near the centre of New York and the circumstances vary greatly in each case.The propriety of sanctioning the site at Battersea for the Central station required by the London P(?v/er Company had to be decided by the Commissioners and Office of Works with reference to the conditions in London and in particular the other sites available, the most suitable of which are on the lower Thames, e.g. at Dartford,
In the Times suggestions have been made by several of the correspondents and In particular by Sir Richard Redmayne that the best alternatives are in the Kent coal fields at Richborough or Dover.The Commissioners understand that this view has been pressed on the Central Electricity Board by an. Influential deputation of persons interested in the rapid development of the proposed   new industrial district In Kent and that prominent industrialists are anxious to build a station there for the Board.     A capital station may very likely be some day required in connection with Kent development but this question is not immediately relevant to the Battersea station, the whole output of which is required for London,     An alternative site is not at Dover or Richborough, between sixty and seventy miles distant, but Dartford sixteen miles away.     The Battersea Station has advantages over a site at Lartford or elsewhere on the lower Thames which may be summarised under three heads:-1.    Convenience of operating a station in the centre of the load.2,    Economy in transmission system.3,    Avoidance of physical difficulties in laying mains in London.1.       Although a station with the exceptional advantages at Battersea placed right in the centre of the load Is a great convenience In the operating of a big inter-connected system the Commissioners do not consider this in itself would have any great weight if the objections on other grounds were substantial, 2,      &quot;The cost of the additional transmission system required if the Battersea Station had been placed at Dartford is, together with the capitalised value of transmission losses, estimated at  3,000,000 sterling, the annual charges on which would amount to  250,000 a year.     The magnitude of the extra costs thus placed
upon the Electricity Industry may be illustrated by pointing out that this link line would be equal to nearly half the cost of the whole of the main transmission system of the Central Board&apos;s South East England Scheme estimated at  6.000,000 and is very much greater than the cost of the whole of the transmission system of the Central Board in Scotland, contracts for which have been let at under  2,000,000.Apart from the cost, the physical difficulty of finding the necessary spaoe for the underground cables in the already over-crowded roads of London is very serious.     For example if the load to be generated at Battersea in 1933 had to be carried by underground cable, 36 separate 66,000 volt cables would be required, the road space required for such high tension cables is very large.      Overhead transmission is obviously impossible and the suggestion that cables might be laid in the bed of the Thames is regarded as impracticable by the Commissionj    and tho^&quot; understand from the Port of London Authority that there are strong objections to any such proposal.Objections to Dattersea Site.The objections raised in the recent correspondence fall under two heads:(1) that dioxide of&quot;sulphur will be emitted in such largequantities as to be Injurious to health and damaging to vegetation and stone-work. (2) that smoke, grit and dirt will be emitted in large quantities.This second suggestion has no foundation in fact and may be rebutted with certainty.     Very special attention has been given to the design and size of the combustion chambers of the boilers and to the method of admitting and utilising pre-heated air so as to secure smokeless combustion.     The liberal installation of seperators and extractors in conjunction with a system of water screens will ensure the elimination of grit
and dust from the flue gases before they emerge from the ohimneys.      In this connection references to or comparison with other stations designed many years ag;o have no relevance and nothing like the objectionable results of Lots Road Station, which is quite out of date,  is possible,The Company will also exercise the utmost care In the selection and preparation of fuels for utilisation at Battersea and in this connection there is no bar to the use of Kent coals, provided they compare favourably on price with supplies from other coal fields.With regard to the first and more important point as to the emission of dioxides of sulphur, the position is as follows: (2)    The Company being placed under a stringent obligation to use the best known means to prevent the emission of oxides of sulphur.      In this connection they will have the advice of some the most eminent chemists in this country to assist them in the design and installation of special plant and apparatus to secure the desired end.No such steps have ever been attempted before in any power station in this or any other country,,      It is manifestly unreasonable to pre-judge the final Issue or to say In advance that remedial measures are impossible of attainment because not hitherto attempted.The Commissioners are assured that the Company are sparing no expense In this matter and based on the results of their experimental work up to the present they are confident that with the continued co--ope.rato.on of their Engineers and Chemists success will attend their efforts in reducing the emission of sulphur oxides from the chimneys to a negligible quantity,(b)    it must be noted that the concentration of the anticipated additional load on the Company&apos;s system at the Battersea Station in contrast to any extended user of the existing stations of the Company must result in a lesser
consumption of coal, in removing altogether the smoke and grit and in lessening the amount of oxides of sulphur emitted by about 30 per cent,, even without special precautions. With the special precautions proposed the transference of part of the output now generated at existing stations to Battersea should improve the general condition of London atmosphere.The Company had arranged with the Electricity Commissioners that in the course of the next few months they should remit detailed plans of the apparatus which they propose to instal together with the results which have been obtained from Laboratory experiments, and the Commissioners then propose to obtain the best independent chemical advice available on these proposals.While the Commissioners consider it desirable to adhere to this course which will enable full criticism to be made in the Company&apos;s proposals before .the installation of the apparatus, the Commissioners would, if it is thought desirable, suggest to the Company that the work should be followed step by step by the Government Chemist acting on behalf of the Commission and Office of Works.Present Position of Battersea Station.The present position is that the necessary consents of the Electricity Commissioners and the Office of Works were given to the Company in June, 1928, and the Company have an indisputabi legal right to proceed with the work up to the limit of the first section, that is, 120,000 kw. out of the contemplated 360,000 lew. (see Appendix).    They have purchased and acquired the site; contracts for the Civil Engineering Works and the plants have bee let to a&apos; total of  1,500,000;    the site has been cleared and work on the foundations is in progress.15th. April. 1929.
Statement of the formal stepsi In the approval of Battersea Station.The Electricity Commussioners have already given their formal consent under Section 11 of the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1919, to the establishment by the London Power Company, Limited, of a new generating station on a riverside site at Battersea to contain initially 120,000 kw. of generating plant.The proceedings on the Company&apos;s application&quot;may be briefly indicated as follows:-1.       A notice of the application dated 15th March, 1927, was duly published by the Parliamentary Agents to the Company in the &quot;Times&quot; on 16th March and again on 21st March, and a public Inquiry was &quot;held by the Commissioners at Savoy Court on   21st June into the application and the objections which had been lodged thereto, Including objections dealing with the question of amenities,2,       In accordance with the provisions of Section 19 of the London Electric Supply Act, 1908, the Company also communicated with H.M. Office of Works applying for the approval of the Commissioners of Works to the erection of a generating station on the site in question.    This matter formed the subject cf correspondence   between the Office of Works and the Electricity Commissioners with reference more particularly to the question of amenities, and the Company subsequently Intimated that they were prepared to accept the inclusion in any consent issued by the Commissioners under Section 11 of the Act of 1919 of a condition to the effeot that the Company should, in the construction and use of the generating station, take the best known precautions for the due consumption of smoke and for preventing as far as reasonably practicable the evolution of oxides of sulphur, and generally for preventing any nuisance arising from the generating station or from any operations thereat.3.       After careful consideration of the evidence given at the public Inquiry and of all the circumstances of the case, the
Commissioners came to the conclusion that a case had boon made&apos; by the Company for the establishment of the proposed gonerating station at Battorsea in the interests of the electrical development of Greater London0    The Commissioners notified ELMa Offico of Works accordingly and intimated that subject to the Commissioners of Works giving their approval under Section 19 of the London Act of 1908 the Electricity Commissioners were prepared to givo their consent under Section 11 of the Act of 1919 to the establishment of the station and to attach to such consent a condition on the lines Indicated above.4.       The Office of Works subsequently informed tho Commissioners that the Commissioners of Works had given their approval to the Company under Section 19 of the Act of 1908 on the understanding that the Company would accept a condition of the above-mentioned character.    The Office of Works also asked that the Electricity Commissioners in giving their consent under Section 11 of the Act of 1919 would attach thereto the above-mentioned condition and this was duly   done by the Electricity Commissioners when issuing their formal consent on 27th October, 1927,5a       The consent given by the Electricity Commissioners also provides for the due submission by the Company of ai ch plans and drawings of the generating station as the Commissioners may require and for the construction of the -station to be In accordance with any such plans or drawings as approved by the Electricity Commissioners!,   Such plans wore submitted and approved by the Commissioners on the 1st November, 1928.6.       The original application of the Company indicated that the station was being designed with an ultimate capacity of   360,000 kw.  in view.   Any extension of the station beyond the initial capacity already sanctioned will Involve a further consent of tho Coinmissloners under Section 11 of the Act of 1919e
