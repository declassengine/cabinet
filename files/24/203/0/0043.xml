[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government, j      ^ ^ ^Printed for the Cabinet.   May 1929.SECRET. Copy No.   28CP. 143 (29).CABINET.DRAFT CONVENTION CONCERNING SEAMEN&apos;S ARTICLES OFAGREEMENT.Memorandum by the Minister of Labour.ON the 1st August, 1928, the Cabinet- considered a Memorandum, CP. 246 (28), dealing with the attitude to be adopted by the Government towards this and certain other Draft Conventions and Recommendations. My colleagues will remember that this Draft Convention is in complete conformity with our existing legislation, except in regard to one point of detail contained in Article 5, which provides that the documents to be issued to every seaman containing a record of his employment on board the vessel shall not contain any statement as to the quality of the seaman&apos;s work. Article 14 of the Convention provides for the issue to the seaman of a separate character report if desired. Under the Merchant Shipping Acts the seaman has the option of having his character report either endorsed on his certificate of discharge or not, as he pleases, and both the shipowners and seamen of this country have expressed through their organisations an emphatic preference for the maintenance of our present practice. In accordance with the decision of the Cabinet, I informed the International Labour Office of this difficulty, pointing out that apart from this one point there was nothing to prevent our immediate, ratification of the Convention. In reply, the International Labour Office agreed that British law affords all the protection to the seaman in regard to this matter that is contemplated by the Convention, and made a suggestion for altering the actual form of the discharge book. This suggestion was, however, considered by the Board of Trade to be impracticable, and accordingly I communicated again with the International Labour Office, pointing out the advantages which British practice gives to the seaman, and -stating that if our present arrangements could be accepted as fulfilling the require-ments of the Convention, His Majesty&apos;s Government would propose to ratify the Convention with a declaration in the following terms : &quot;His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government, in ratifying the International Convention concerning Seamen&apos;s Articles of Agreement, wish to draw attention to the law and practice existing in Great Britain affecting the issue of records of seamen&apos;s service, and statements as to the quality of their work. Article 5 of the Convention provides that every seaman shall be given a document which contains a record of his service in a ship, but contains no statement as to the quality of his work or as to his wages; and Article 14 provides that the seaman shall be able to obtain, in addition, a separate certificate as to the quality of his work. British law and practice enable every seaman who so desires to obtain each of these documents. They provide, in addition, that seamen may, if they so desire, have reports of character endorsed on their discharge certificates whether the certificates are in the form of sheets relating to single voyages or of books relating to several voyages. His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government take the view that British law affords all the protection to seamen that the Convention contemplates, and they ratify the Convention on the understanding that the provisions described above are regarded as satisfying its requirements.&quot;[19268]
No official reply to this suggestion has been received. I understand, however, semi-officially that the International Labour Office do not anticipate any objection being raised. I propose, therefore, that we should proceed at once to ratify this Convention, attaching to our ratification a declaration in the terms set out above.I should add that I have consulted the Board of Trade as the Department immediately concerned, and I understand that they are in agreement with this proposal.(Initialled)        A. S.-M.Ministry of Labour, May 6, 1929.
