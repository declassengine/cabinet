Terms of Reference.The terms of reference are as follows :  (a.) In Peace.To collect and examine information in regard to departmental estimates of oil and tanker tonnage requirements for all purposes in time of war, and the position in respect of stocks, supplies, sources of production and tanker tonnage, and at least once a year to report to the Committee of Imperial Defence thereon, with such recommendations in regard thereto as they may think proper.(b.) In War.(i.) At the outbreak of war to make immediate recommendations to the Committee of Imperial Defence or to the appropriate departments as to any action necessary to conserve and maintain adequate supplies, including the provision of tanker tonnage, on the basis that it is of vital necessity that Admiralty requirements be met (whether by allocation of a minimum supply of fuel oil and . tanker tonnage or otherwise) to the fullest possible extent compatible with the maintenance of other essential war services.(ii.) The Board, with such additions as it may itself decide, will then be constituted as an Oil Control Board for the control and rationing of all oil supplies, and will deal with all demands for tanker tonnage put forward from time to time on behalf of the various departments of State and Allies, and adjust, as far as possible, all questions of priority in case of conflicting demands.
REPORT.Introduction.During the past year some difficulty has been experienced in the collection of figures from commercial sources, and this has entailed the postponement of the Annual Report. The present date is now so near the time when figures for 1928 will be available that it has been considered advisable to leave the revision of oil require-ments and tanKers to the next Annual Report, and in this Report to deal with the Report of the Sub-Committee on Oil Supply in Time of War (Annexure &quot; A &quot;), a Report on Benzol (Annexure &quot; B &quot;), a Report on Civil Oil Requirements of Canada (Annexure &quot; C &quot;), and the consideration of the Baghdad-Mediterranean oil pipeline referred to us by the Committee of Imperial Defence at its 234th Meeting.Time of rendering the Annual Report.2. In view of the fact that figures regarding the production and shipment of oil for the year are usually available in March, it is recommended that the Oil Board should present its Annual Report in June of each year instead of November.Importance of Benzol.3. In view of the importance of benzol for both civil and military purposes (aircraft are at present using a benzol mixture normally containing 20 per cent, of benzol, but sometimes as much as 40 to 45 per cent.), the members of the Corrrmittee representing the Air Ministry and War Office were asked to prepare a paper, in con-junction with the Petroleum Department of the Board of Trade on Benzol.4. From this paper (Annexure &quot; B &quot;) it appears that approximately one-third of the benzol used in this country in 1927 (about 40,000 tons) was imported, and that in war the additional requirements of the Services will be considerable. As the installation of the necessary plant for increasing the supply of benzol takes time, it will be necessary at the outbreak of hostilities to take measures to conserve stocks and increase supplies.Recommendations regarding Benzol.5. In view of the above considerations the Oil Board recommends that the following action should be taken on the outbreak of hostilities : (-a.) Benzol and petrol to be placed on the list of commodities of which export is prohibited except under licence.(o.) The production and distribution of benzol should be controlled from the outset of hostilities, for which purpose the organisation of the National Benzol Company (who control 95 per cent, of home-produced benzol) could be employed. Measures should also be taken to control the impor-tation of benzol in Great Britain and Northern Ireland.(c.) Arrangements should be made to (i.) Instal at Gas Works, selected in agreement with the Board of Trade, the necessary plant for the extraction of benzol and toluol, (ii.) Have an Order made by the Board of Trade under the appropriateDefence Regulation prescribing lower calorific value for gas.&apos;, (iii.) Import Borneo crude oil, from which both benzol and toluol can be extracted.   (In a Far Eastern War this may not be practicable.) (iv.) Ensure that an adequate supply of benzol is made available for the dye industry.Oil Requirements of Dominions and Colonies.6. In August 1928 the First and Second Annual Oil Board Reports were circulated to the Dominions under cover of a despatch, dated the 9th August, 1928, in which His Majesty&apos;s Governments in the Dominions were invited to forward such information as they considered might be of assistance to the Oil Board in its future work.
7. The Canadian Government referred the Reports to the Director of Naval Intelligence, Ottawa, who prepared a comprehensive report of Canadian oil requirements (Annexure &quot; C &quot;) on the basis indicated in the Oil Board Reports. This valuable Report confirms the estimates on which the Oil Board have based their investigations on the subject of supply in war.8. The Minister for External Affairs, South Africa, in a despatch, dated the 15th February, 1929, has&apos; intimated that the estimated requirements of the Union of South Africa during the first year of war would be: The despatch points out that these estimates are necessarily very approximate, but that it was thought the military requirements might largely be met by restricting civil consumption.9. The Governor-General of New Zealand, in a despatch dated the 30th November, 1928, states that the question of oil fuel requirements in New Zealand in the event of war has been referred by his Ministers to the New Zealand Supply Committee for investigation, and that a further reply will be forwarded in due course.10. The Officer Administering the Government of Newfoundland, in a despatch dated the 8th October, 1928, states that, as none of the large oil-burning ocean-going vessels take fuel at St. John&apos;s, no developments have taken place at that port for the supply of oil fuel since the war, and that the quantity of fuel required in Newfoundland in the event of war would depend upon the amount of tonnage calling at Newfoundland ports. His Ministers therefore advised that they could not provide any further particulars for the assistance of the Oil Board.11. The Oil Board, in complying with their terms of reference have found that, in order that the requirements oi the Empire might be met in a war, it would be necessary not only that the military needs should be known, but also that the civil requirements in the Dominions and Colonies should be known with some accuracy. Until now the Oil Board have estimated the needs of the Dominions and Colonies in the contingency contemplated on figures available in London. For the proper prosecution of the Board&apos;s work, however, periodic reports from the Dominions and other parts of the Empire regarding the consumption, &amp;c, of oil are necessary.Recommendations regarding Oil Requirements of the Dominions and Colonies.12. The Oil Board recommend that the Governments of the Dominions and Colonies should be invited to forward information, as soon after the 1st January as possible each year, under the following headings : (a.) The estimated consumption in the previous year of fuel and gas oil, petrol,kerosene and lubricating oil. (&amp;.) The imports of fuel and gas oil, petrol, kerosene and lubricating oil duringthe past year, their sources of supply, and method of importation, whetherby tanker in bulk, package, pipe-line or rail, (c.) The total production of oil during the past year within their territories. (d.) The capacity, in crude oil, of existing refineries within their territories. (e.) Any information regarding : (i.) Developments in the transport of oil by pipe-line or rail instead of tanker.(ii.) Development  of  the  production of oil  from  coal  either  by hydrogenation, low temperature carbonisation or other methods, (iii.) Development of the production of benzol at gas works and coke ovens.Aviation spiritBenzol ... ...Mechanical Transport PetrolGallons. 120,000 12,000 750,000
Supplies, Sources of Production and Tanker Tonnage in relation to the Oil Requirements of the Empire in Time of War.13. During the past year a Sub-Committee of the Oil Board has been collecting and examining information with the object of advising how the oil requirements of the Empire in war could best be met. The terms of reference to this Sub-Committee required that they should examine the question under two hypotheses firstly, that the United States was a friendly neutral, and, secondly, that the United States was an unfriendly neutral.The Oil Board are in general agreement with the proposals contained in the Sub-Committee&apos;s Report (Annexure &quot;A &quot;) regarding the organisation of supplies in war for meeting Empire oil requirements under the hypotheses given, and the recommendations of the Board thereon are set out in paragraph 18.14. From their Report it would appear that with the U.S.A. &quot;friendly,&quot; the full requirements of the Empire under war conditions could eventually be met, but that, owing to the additional production and refining required to meet the enhanced demand and to the rearrangement of sea-transport necessary, there would be a critical period following the declaration of hostilities during which it would be impracticable to ensure full supplies to all parts of the Empire.15. Should the U.S.A. be &quot; unfriendly &quot; and withhold supplies of oil from the Empire, the situation would be precarious. Vigorous efforts to develop production and refining at all suitable places under British control or influence would be necessary. The critical period during which full supplies could not be assured for the Empire would probably be of considerable length in such circumstances.16. The Sub-Committee recommend inter alia that sufficient reserves of fuel oil and lubricating oils should be accumulated in time of peace to meet the anticipated needs of all the Fighting Services of the Crown (including supplies required for Munitions Establishments) during the first year of hostilities; and that consideration should be given by the respective Governments of the Empire to the preparation of schemes for rationing civilian oil requirements ready for institution on the outbreak of war.17. In order to implement the recommendation regarding rationing, it will be necessary for the Oil Board to prepare a scheme for rationing petroleum products in the United Kingdom. The scheme would have to be sufficiently flexible to allow the rationing of only such petroleum products as are short or are likely to be short after the outbreak of hostilities. If the outlined scheme is adopted by His Majesty&apos;s Government in Great Britain, particulars thereof should, it is suggested, be sent to the Dominion and Colonial Governments for their information.Recommendations regarding Oil Supply in Time of War.18. In forwarding their report the Oil Board wishes to draw the attention of the Committee of Imperial Defence to the following considerations which have arisen from the study of how the oil supplies of the Empire can be met in a maritime war : (a.) In existing circumstances it is possible to meet the requirements of the Empire only if supplies from the Anglo-Persian field in South Persia are assured. Thirty-seven per cent. (7,000,000 tons) of the Empire&apos;s requirements will have to be obtained from this source.(&amp;.) In view of the rapid change in the development of oil interests all over the world, it is recommended that the scheme for meeting Empire oil requirements in war should be revised triennially.,(c.) In view of our present dependence upon foreign refineries it is of importance that in peace every encouragement should be given to the installation and development of petroleum refineries within the Empire, and that our preparation for war should include the consideration of the steps that should be taken to construct extra refineries on British or British-controlled territory as soon as war becomes imminent.
(d.) As is pointed out in the report of the Sub-Committee, the supply of lubricating oil in war time is a very difficult problem. The stocks held commercially are small: the main sources of supply are the United States, a source which the Sub-Committee assumed not to be available if the United States were &quot; unfriendly,&quot; and Russia, which it was assumed could not be relied upon. To obtain lubricants from other sources would take time, and in any event their quality might not be such as to make them suitable. The Admiralty, whose demands for lubricating oil exceed those of the other Services are building up a reserve of one year&apos;s supply. lo is recommended that the War Office and Air Ministry should be asked to consider the advisability of building up a reserve of lubricating oil to meet their requirements for the first year of war, and that the Principal Supply Officers Committee should be invited to advise the Oil Board as to the quantity of lubricating oil likely to be required for munitions manufacture during the first year of war in order that the recommendations of the Sub-Committee as to accumulating a reserve for such work may be considered.(e.) The difficulty of meeting the oil fuel requirements of the Navy, as indicated in the Oil Board&apos;s first annual report, in a maritime war is so great that unless one year&apos;s supply for the Fleet is in reserve at the outbreak of hostilities, the requirements of the Fleet, as stated in that Report, cannot be assured.(/.) War requirements entail such a large increase in the output and refining of oil, and the reorganisation of distribution by tankers, that the following measures are recommended in order that the needs of the Empire in time of war should be met: (i.) The preparation of schemes to ration oil products for civilian use. (The Oil Board proposes to undertake this work for the United Kingdom in the coming year, and will circulate their recommenda-tions to the Dominions and Colonies for their information.) (ii.) The co-operation of all parts of the Empire in the purchase, refining and distribution of petroleum products in time of war. This question might, it is suggested, be taken up as part of a discussion on defence matters on the occasion of the next Imperial Conference and Colonial Conference.Effect of the Construction of an Oil Pipe-Line from Baghdad to the Mediterranean.19. The Committee of Imperial Defence at its 234th Meeting held on the 29th March, 1928, instructed the Oil Board to examine what effect the construction of an oil pipe-line from Iraq to the Mediterranean would have on Empire require-ments. As the output of the proposed pipe-line and the location of the refineries is not known, the Oil Board has made certain assumptions which are based on the expressed expectations of the Oil Companies in Iraq and Persia.20. There are three oil-bearing areas which could be served by the proposed pipe-line, the Turkish Petroleum Company&apos;s Field in Iraq, the Anglo-Persian Company&apos;s Field in the Transferred Territory (also in Iraq), and the Anglo-Persian Company&apos;s Fields in South Persia.The Turkish Petroleum Company is surveying and testing the various potential oil-fields that lie between Mosul and the Transferred Territories. The drilling is confirming the accuracy of the surveys, four wells having come into oil at very high pressures in the Bada Gurga (Kirkuk) field, while two other wells, in a field 55 miles to the west-north-west, have also come into production. In the areas further to the south-east pressures of 1,200 lbs. per square inch have been met with and two wells are expected to come into production within the next few weeks. No estimate of the capacity of the fields can, however, be made until their limits are known and the effect on the pressures as a result of heavy production have been ascertained.   The
indications are that a number of very rich fields are about to be opened up by the Turkish Petroleum Company. A memorandum, regarding the Turkish Petroleum Company&apos;s concessions in Iraq, is attached (Annexure &quot; D &quot;).The Transferred Territory oil-field has been proved and a number of wells have c&apos;.&apos;me into production, but have been shut down pending the construction of a pipe-line to the Mediterranean.In South Persia the existing field has been proved and its limits defined. It is found that the oil-bearing strata extends over an area some 13 miles long and 5 miles wide from which the existing pipe-lines could, if worked to their maximum capacity, take 7,000,000 tons a year : new fields at Haft Kel to the eastward of Ahwaz in South Persia are now being proved, and the Company anticipate thai! they may be even as rich as the existing South Persian Pield.21. The oil transported by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company to markets west of Suez suffers the disadvantage of having to be transported some 3,200 miles from Abadan to Suez and then has to pay heavy Canal fees which in the year 1927 amounted to nearly  900,000. Should a pipe-line be constructed from Baghdad to Haifa and the demands for Anglo-Persian Company&apos;s Oil west of Suez exceed the amounts which the Company could obtain from their holding in the Turkish Petroleum Company and their own field in the Transferred Territory, a pipe-line from the South Persian Fields to Baghdad might be constructed so as to avoid the long and costly sea route.22. The Turkish Petroleum Company have intimated that they must develop their fields so as to ensure the production of 3,000,000 tons of oil a year before they can undertake the construction of a pipe-line. Under the provisions of the Companies Convention with the Iraq Government, the capacity of this pipe-line has to be large enough to allow 30 per cent, of the oil carried to be the property of Companies, other than the Turkish Petroleum Company, that are successful at an auction of plots. The pipe-line will therefore have a minimum capacity of 3,900,000 tons per annum when first constructed.23. The Oil Board are, in view of the above-mentioned considerations, assuming for the purpose of this report that 4,000,000 tons of crude oil could be made available, in the event of war, at the Mediterranean terminal of the pipeline from Baghdad. It is next for consideration what percentage of this oil would be obtainable for the use of the Empire.24. From the statements made in paragraph 19 above, it is assumed that 3,000,000 tons of the oil arriving at the Mediterranean terminal will in any event be the property of the Turkish Petroleum Company. By the composition of the Company and its terms of agreement, 31-375 per cent, of the oil will be British (Anglo-Persian), and the Royal Dutch-Shell, French and American groups will each possess 21-375 per cent., while Mr. Gulbenkian will own 4-5 per cent., (see Annexure &quot;D&quot;). Having taken into consideration the interests and composition of the Royal Dutch-Shell Group, the Oil Board considers that reliance may be placed on the British Empire being able to obtain in war the Royal Dutch-Shell quota of oil as well as that of the Anglo-Persian Company. It can be assumed, therefore, that the British Empire can rely on the use of 52-75 per cent, of the oil obtained by the Turkish Petroleum Company, which, if only the minimum amount to justify the construction of the pipeline is obtained, will amount to 1,582,000 tons. Further, the Oil Board considers that the American interests would be quite prepared to part with their oil to the highest bidder, and that, therefore, in practice the. British Empire would be able to obtain the American quota of oil also; with the object, however, of making a conservative estimate, it is proposed not to include the American oil in the quantity that might prove available to the British Empire.25. It is next for consideration what quantity of the oil. obtained by companies successful at the auction for plots in Iraq which have to be held annually is likely to become available for the British Empire. As is explained in Annexure &quot;D&quot; to this report, the Turkish Petroleum Convention is so worded as to suggest the possibility that the Turkish Petroleum Company could outbid any competitor at an auction, which would mean that a subsidiary Company representing the Turkish Petroleum Company could control the remaining 30 per cent, of the pipeline output. If this were to occur, the British (Anglo-Persian) and the Royal Dutch-Shell would together be able to dispose of a further 13-75 per cent, of the Iraq oil, which would bring the total oil available for the Empire.to approximately 2,000,000 tons. [19158] c
26. On tne other hand, should the auction of plots not result in an agreement satisfactorily to the Turkish Petroleum Company, it is reasonable to suppose that British and Dutch interests will be able to obtain a fair proportion of the oil.In these circumstances, the Oil Board considers that it may be estimated that, of the 30 per cent, of pipeline capacity made available for interests other than the Turkish Petroleum Company, 13-75 per cent, may be counted upon for the use of the Empire.27. A total of 2,000,000 tons of oil will, on the assumptions made above, be. added to the stocks that the British Empire could draw upon when the pipelines from the Iraq and the Transferred Territory Oil Fields have been completed to the Mediterranean. In other words, 10 per cent, of our estimated Empire requirements for a war in the year 1937 could be met from this source, providing the pipeline were not damaged and the conditions did not make the supply susceptible to foreign control.28. On the other hand, if the terminal were to exist at a French Syrian port, His Majesty&apos;s Government could not rely on obtaining oil for its Fleet from this source, and the unsatisfactory situation would exist of a vital interest of the British Empire being under the protection of a foreign Government. It might also prevent the construction of a Mediterranean outlet for the Anglo-Persian oil, as, by the San Remo Agreement, 25 per cent, of oil exported by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company from a French Syrian port is liable to purchase by the French Government, an arrangement that might prove embarrassing to the Company and His Majesty&apos;s Government. Further, it has to be recollected that, although by the Articles of the Mandate &quot;there shall be freedom of transit under equitable conditions across the Mandated Area,&quot; it would be possible for the Syrian Government to levy an export tax on oil shipped from a port under their control.29. As has been indicated in the Sub-Committee&apos;s Report on oil supply in time of war, the Empire would in a big maritime war be dependent upon the receipt of no less a quantity than 7,000,000 tons of oil from the Anglo-Persian fields in South Persia. The construction of a pipeline from the Iraq and Transferred Territories&apos; oil fields to Haifa would reduce the dependence of the Empire on the goodwill of Persia, and should a pipeline also be constructed from the South Persian fields to the Baghdad-Haifa pipeline, the possibilities of interference by Persia on grounds of neutrality would be minimised.30. One of the greatest difficulties in meeting the demands for oil in war, particularly in the early stages, is the provision of an adequate number of tankers. Should war occur to-day there would be a shortage of some 50 of these vessels to meet Empire requirements if no rationing is instituted. Until a Mediterranean outlet to the Iraq and Persian Fields is provided, tankers carrying oil from the reserves in Great Britain to the Fleet in the Far East would proceed to Abadan on their return trip to embark crude oil for the Home refineries. This journey to Abadan would mean an extension of the ordinary voyage by 21 days for each tanker. Should a pipeline to Haifa exist, however, these tankers would call at Haifa instead of Abadan, and a saving of 16 days in the voyage of each of these tankers would be effected.31.    Conclusions regarding Baghdad-Mediterranean Pipeline. The Oil Board advise that (1.) If the terminal of the Baghdad pipeline is at Haifa, then (a.) The British Empire may anticipate receiving 52 - 7 per cent, of the oil raised by the Turkish Petroleum Company&quot;, and even if this quantity should not exceed the minimum required for the construc-tion of the pipeline, some 10 per cent. (2,000,000 tons) of the total petroleum required by the Empire in a war in the year 1937 could be met from this source.(b.) An additional source of oil supply under British control would become available for the Empire and would be of immense importance in time of war in the event of either (i) the United States of America being unfriendly, or (ii) the maximum output from the South Persian Fields being unobtainable for any reason.
Should the demand for Anglo-Persian Oil west of Suez justify the construction of a pipeline from the Southern Persian Fields to the Baghdad-Haifa route, a saving of a 6,400 miles&apos; journey by sea and the Suez Canal charges ( 900,000 in 1927) would be effected. In these circumstances it would not be necessary for Tankers fuelling the Fleet from Great Britain, in the event of a war in the Far East, to carry oil from Abadan homewards as they could ship oil at Haifa. The result would be an important saving of tanker tonnage, as the time saved in deviation to Haifa instead of Abadan would be 16 days. Further, whatever the theatre of war, Anglo-Persian oil would be readily available, as it could be diverted east or west as required.(2.) If the terminal is at a Syrian Port, then (d.) The British Empire could not rely on the receipt of oil from this source.(e.) On account of the San Remo Oil Agreement, by which the French Government can claim the purchase of 25 per cent, of the oil shipped by the Anglo-Persian Company through a Syrian Port, it would be less likely that the Anglo-Persian Oil Company would develop a Mediterranean outlet for their oil and the full advantages (b) and (c) above would not be obtained.(/.) The danger of an export tax being placed on the oil by the Syrian Government would exist.(a.) The protection of a pipeline vital to the Empire would be in the hands of a Foreign Power.(3.) In view of the- above considerations it will be of first importance to the Empire in a maritime war that the oil pipeline from Iraq should have a terminal at Haifa.Signed oh behalf of the Oil Board, PEEL, President.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1, April 26, 1929.[19158]d

OIL BOARD SUB-COMMITTEE (1928).Composition and Terms of Reference.AT the 7th Meeting of the Oil Board, held on the 14th March, 1928, it was agreed that a Sub-Committee should be set up to collect and examine information in regard to supplies, sources of production and tanker tonnage in relation to the oil requirements of the Empire in time of War as outlined in the Second Annual Report of the Oil Board.Tbe Sub-Committee was constituted as follows : The Rt. Hon. Earl Stanhope, D.S.O., M.C.,  Civil Lord, Admiralty (Chairman).Mr. J.  W. L. Oliver, C.B., C.B.E., Director of Stores  Department, Admiralty.Mr. E. J. Foley, C.B., Director of Sea Transport, Board of Trade. Mr. J. J. Wills, Director of Petroleum Department, Board of Trade. Mr. R. A. Pitcher, Naval Store Department. AdmiraltyMr. C. E. W. Justice, O.B.E., Mercantile Marine I    Joint Department, Board of Trade (Secretaries.*Mr. G. Haly, Petroleum Department, Board of Trade&quot; Co-opted after the first meeting of the Sub-Committee.The Terms of Reference were : &quot; To collect and examine information in regard to supplies, sources of production and tanker tonnage in relation to the various oil requirements of the Empire in time of war, as scheduled in the 2nd Annual Oil Board Report, on the supposition that (1) the United States of America was a friendly neutral; (2) the United States of America was an unfriendly neutral; and to report the steps that would be necessary to meet those requirements at the , present time.&quot; &apos;[191581
Report of Oil Board Sub-Committee.Introduction.1. In considering our terms of reference at our first meeting, we agreed that it was essential to give an interpretation to the terms &quot; friendly &quot; and &quot; unfriendly &quot; neutral in connection with obtaining supplies of oil from the United States of America, and we decided to proceed on the following alternative assumptions (1) that supplies could be obtained from the United States of America; and (2) that supplies could not be obtained from the United States of America.With regard to the second alternative, we have assumed that the intervention of the United States Government would take the form of a prohibition of exports from United States territory, and would not extend to restrictions on the activities in other countries of United States nationals. Consequently, we have assumed that oil in the possession or control of American citizens or companies would be obtainable from countries outside the United States.We have taken the &quot; present time &quot; as 1927. and have dealt with the problem as for that year.2. We have further assumed that, even as an &quot; unfriendly&apos;&apos; neutral, the United States of America for various reasons would have continued to supply the Dominion of Canada with oil in quantities not less than those that normally cross the common frontier either by pipe-line, rail or water.Treaty Relations with Oil-Producing Countries.3. It is relevant at this stage to refer to the fact that the Government of the United States is under a treaty obligation to allow the export of oil to this country as freely as to other foreign countries, and that twelve months&apos; notice is necessary to terminate the treaty; though we are conscious of the possibility that, as in the last war, the needs of the Empire might call for the restriction of trading in certain commodities with the United States of America, and that this might afford an opportunity for the United States Government to retaliate by restricting oil exports to the Empire. A note by the Board of Trade on our treaty relations with oil-producing countries is appended (Appendix VIII).Effect of Increased War Requirements of Japan.4. We understand that the Advisory Committee on Trading and Blockade have advised the Committee of Imperial Defence in their 3rd Annual Report that the war requirements of Japan for oil fuel for naval purposes may be estimated at one and a half million tons per annum. Her purchases of oil in 1927 for naval requirements amounted to about half a million tons, so that the requirements of the Japanese Navy which a war would impose amount to about one million tons of fuel oil additional to her normal supply.5. The total import into Japan of petroleum products (excluding those from Formosa and Saghalien) in 1926 was nearly three million tons, of which about two and a quarter millions came from the United States of America, and the remainder mainly from Dutch East Indies. It can be assumed, therefore, that the war import of petroleum products by Japan would be in the neighbourhood of four million tons, and, as the Dutch East Indies cannot be relied on as a source of supply, the major portion would have to be obtained from the United States of America. Of this four million tons only one million tons (additional naval fuel) and three-quarter million tons (normally imported from Dutch East Indies) are additional to the quantities usually exported to Japan by the United States of America.6. We are of opinion that this one and three-quarter million tons of additional oil could be supplied to Japan by the United States of America without seriously affecting our supply position. This movement would increase the total demand for tanker tonnage, but not sufficiently to alter the estimate on the Second Annual Report of the Oil Board as to the neutral tonnage we can &quot;expect to secure in emergency.
7. If the United States of America withheld oil from Japan it is difficult to see how the latter could obtain adequate supplies, Japan&apos;s position being infinitely worse than our own under a similar stoppage of supplies by the United States of America.Chief Factors Governing Oil Supply.8. In considering such a problem as that set by our terms of reference, there must inevitably De a number of indefinite factors. To make our conclusions as definite as possible, we have worked mainly on the basis of the facts of oil production and movement for 1926.9.   The problem of oil supply rests, in the main, upon three factors : (1.) World oil production. (2.) World refining capacity. (3.) Means of transport by sea.However great potential production of oil may be and there is no doubt that it is amply sufficient to meet needs even on a war basis the problem will not be solved unless refining capacity exists or can be installed to produce the oil products necessary, and unless shipping can be made available to move those products from the place of production or refining to the consuming areas.10. Obviously the oil production, the refining plant and the tanker tonnage situated within British territories or sailing under the British flag are all that we can be certain of controlling&apos; in an emergency. These are not sufficient to meet our war needs, and later portions of this Report will show the supplies we can reasonably expect from the Empire and those we hope to get from foreign countries to make up deficiencies.Empire Requirements.11. On the basis of the data given in the Second Annual Report of the Oil Board, we have endeavoured to form a picture of the supply problem involved if the Empire had been at war with a Far Eastern Power in 1927, and we have rearranged the figures to show the requirements East and West of Suez respectively (Appendix I). We would, however, emphasise the fact that, as already stated in the Report of the Oil Board, the figures relating to the oil requirements of the Dominions, Colonies and Dependencies represent only the balance of imports over exports, and that it is essential to obtain more complete data at the earliest opportunity. This can only be done with the assistance of the Dominion and Colonial Governments.12. It will be observed that the crude petroleum and liquid petroleum products to be imported into the Empire during the first year of war reach the figure of nineteen and one-third million tons. If drastic rationing is imposed on civilian requirements in the United Kingdom the total is reduced to about seventeen and one-third million tons. Of these totals the military requirements amount to 7,807,000 tons, including the additional naval requirement for fuel oil of six and one-half million tons. This six and a half million tons represents an increase of 100 per cent, (about) over the normal imports of fuel oil necessary to meet all Empire requirements in time of peace.Rationing.13. It will be seen from succeeding paragraphs that, even on the assumption that rationing is applied in the United Kingdom to the drastic extent indicated in the first Annual Report of the Oil Board, we have found very great difficulty in suggesting sources of supply in the event of the U.S.A. being &quot; unfriendly.&quot; We are convinced that rationing would in any circumstances have to be enforced from the outset of any extensive war, since the rate of consumption would at once rise rapidly, while the increased supplies to meet it would not become available for some time. We are consequently of opinion that it will not suffice to limit the application of rationing to the United Kingdom, and that the question of rationing civilian oil requirements in the event of a war of any magnitude must be considered by all the Governments of the Empire.
Commercial Oil Stocks in United Kingdom.14. A statement of the stocks of oil held by the larger oil importing and storing companies in Great Britain on the 31st December, 1927, is attached (Appendix VII).15. While for the reasons given in the Appendix the position in regard to lubricating oil is not completely known, it will be seen that on the 31st December, 1927, there were only three to three and a half months&apos; supply of motor spirit; four to four and a half months&apos; supply of kerosene; about four months&apos; supply of lubricating oil and only one and a half to two months&apos; supply of both fuel oil and crude oil. These periods refer to civilian requirements in the United Kingdom only, and to normal rates of expenditure.Maximum Production.16. We have ascertained by informal enquiries from the chief British oil-producing companies what could have been the maximum production during 1927 in the various fields over which they have control. The information obtained, together with the estimates formed thereon, is set out in Appendices III and V.Reliance placed on Supplies from Persian Fields.17. When considering the sources of oil supplies within the sphere of influence of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom, we have assumed that the output of the Persian Oilfields would be available to meet the requirements of the British Empire up to the maximum that could be transported to Abadan. It is outside our province to consider whether this assumption is justified, but we desire to call attention to the fact that any action by the Persian Government restricting the availability of this oil for Empire use would have most serious effects. In this Report we have relied on obtaining 7,000,000 tons of oil from the Persian field, of which 4,500,000 tons are to be refined at Abadan, but these totals can be increased if the proposals in the next paragraph are put into effect.Expansion of Persian Output.18. We have ascertained from the Anglo-Persian Oil Company that, if the necessary steps were taken to ensure priority in the manufacture and shipment of material, another pipe-line from the Persian field to Abadan could be completed by the end of the first six months of hostilities. This would increase the total throughput of crude to Abadan during the first year of hostilities by 20 per cent., or 1,400,000 tons. Corresponding extensions to the Abadan refinery to deal with this extra crude would, however, take nine months.Expansion of Refineries to deal with additional Venezuelan and other Crude.19. We are informed that, even if priority in construction and provision of materials were afforded, it is improbable that extra refinery plant could be installed and brought into use in less than six months in Great Britain and Curacao.Suggested Sources of Supply.20. Appendices IV and V show in detail the manner in which we consider supplies for the Empire might be obtained in the alternative conditions set out in paragraph 1 of this report, viz., U.S.A. &quot; friendly &quot; and U.S.A. &quot; unfriendly.&quot; We wish to draw attention to the comments on these appendices in the following paragraphs.21. Appendix IV (U.S.A. &quot; friendly &quot;) includes provision for the full require-ments of the civilian population of the United Kingdom. Appendix V (U.S.A. &quot; unfriendly&quot;) includes provision for the civilian requirements of the United Kingdom under drastic rationing. With U.S.A. &quot;unfriendly&quot; the full Empire requirements of lubricating oils are not procurable and the shortage must be met by rationing.
22. With, the U.S.A. &quot;unfriendly &quot; we have relied on Venezuela to the extent of one and three-quarter million tons of crude, and three and three-quarter million tons of refined products, the latter to be obtained from Venezuelan crude by the Curacao refinery. To ensure obtaining such large quantities both the drilling of new wells in Venezuela and the installation of additional refining plant at the Curacao refinery are necessary, and these additions cannot be brought into full effective operation under six, months. Without adequate reserves, serious shortages during the interim are inevitable. Special attention must also be given to the provision of shallow draught steamers or lighters to enable the extra crude to be ferried from Lake Maracaibo to Curacao or Aruba.Russia disregarded as a Source of Supply for the Empire.23. It will be seen from Appendix V that Russia has not been treated as a source of supply for the Empire. This omission is based on the assumption that in such a war as that now contemplated Russia would not be likely to assist the British Empire to obtain essential supplies.East Indies not available as a Source of Sup*ply.24. In view of the probable war activities of Japan, we have disregarded the Dutch East Indies and Sarawak as possible sources of supply for the Empire during the first year of hostilities.Essence of the Problem.25. Apart from shipping considerations, which are referred to later, the main difficulty will be to provide adequate supplies of fuel oil and lubricants. With the U.S.A. &quot; friendly &quot; this difficulty will, be overcome as soon as arrangements can be made for producing and refining the additional oil required, but there will be several months of difficulty while production, refining and transport are being rearranged to meet war conditions. With the U.S.A. &quot;unfriendly&quot; the difficulties will be greatly increased, and the problem of obtaining adequate and suitable supplies of refined products will take much longer to solve. Indeed, in the case of lubricants, the problem might not be capable of full solution. We must point out that the additional lubricants manufactured to meet war requirements from Venezuelan and Burmah crude oil may at first be of a somewhat makeshift character compared with the highly refined and specialised oils to which industry is accustomed, and therefore the provision of munitions might be seriously impeded.26. Whether the U.S.A. is &quot;friendly&quot; or &quot;unfriendly&quot; there will undoubtedly be a critical period while production and refining facilities are being augmented to meet the enhanced demand, and while sea-transport is being rearranged, to meet the requirements of the Fighting Forces. Many factors will affect the length of this period, and it is impossible to estimate closely its duration, but it is essential to make provision in time of peace for the accumulation of adequate reserves to ensure that the operations of the Fighting Forces and the production of munitions for their use are not seriously hampered by insufficiency of supplies during the critical period referred to. For this purpose we regard one year&apos;s war supply of fuel oil and lubricating oils for the Fighting Services and for the manufacture of munitions as the minimum to be aimed at. .&apos;Tanker Position.27. In Appendix VI we have reviewed the tanker position in the light of the altered scheme of distribution arising out of the increased quantities of Persian crude and products assumed to be available. It will be seen that the number of tankers required for the transport of the total requirements of the Empire is 465, compared with the 476 referred to in the second Annual Report of the Oil Board. The shortages shown in that Report are, therefore, reduced to 49 if no rationing cuts are imposed on the U.K. civilian requirements, or to 3 if drastic rationing is enforced in the U.K., and would entirely disappear if rationing were enforced throughout the Empire.
28. The effect of an &quot; unfriendly &quot; United States on the general tanker position is difficult to estimate. Even if U.S.A. refuse to charter tankers to the British Empire it is inconceivable that the tankers would be laid up, and, so long as they are available for charter by someone else, the total pool of tanker tonnage on which, we can draw is not affected. We have also to remember that there is a considerable quantity of Scandinavian tanker tonnage employed in the American oil trade, and in the circumstances now under consideration these neutral tankers would undoubtedly become available for chartering by the British Empire. On the whole, while there would be disturbances and delay, it does not appear that such an attitude on the part of the U.S.A. would seriously affect the total tanker tonnage available, and the position would remain very much the same as we have assumed to be the case if the U.S.A. were friendly.Recapitulation of Important Assumptions.29. Before stating our conclusions it is advisable to reiterate certain important assumptions we have made : (a.) That the full output of the Persian field will be available.(&amp;.) That in the event of U.S.A. being an &quot;unfriendly &quot; neutral, the oil from American-owned Companies outside U.S.A. territory will still be avail-able for the Empire, and that U.S.A. will continue to supply Canada with the quantities of oil which the latter obtains from U.S.A. in normal times.On the other hand, we have assumed (c.) That no oil will be obtainable from either the East Indies or Russia.30. Conclusions.(a.) The main disturbing factor is the additional 6A million tons of Fuel Oil required for the Navy during the first year of hostilities&quot; which alone represent an increase of about 100 per cent, over the peace-time imports of Fuel Oil for all Empire services (paragraph 12).(&amp;.) While production and refining facilities are being augmented to meet the enhanced war demand, and while sea-transport is being rearranged, there will be a critical period during which it will be impracticable to procure and deliver at all points of consumption throughout the Empire the full quantities of petroleum required (paragraphs 25 and 26).(c.) Civilian requirements of petroleum throughout the Empire would, there-fore, have to be rationed from the outbreak of war until supplies to meet full requirements were forthcoming (paragraph 13).(d.) In order that the operations of the Fighting Forces and the provision of munitions may not be seriously hampered by insufficiency of supplies during the critical period referred to at (&amp;), adequate reserves of Fuel Oil and Lubricating Oils must be accumulated in time of peace (paragraph 26).(e.) In the event of a Far Eastern war it is essential that the full quota of crude oil and refined products stated in paragraph 17 should be obtained from the Persian Field (paragraph 17).(/.) If U.S.A. should withhold supplies of oil from the Empire, immediate steps would be necessary to develop production and refining in Venezuela and at Curacao. Special attention would have to be given to the provision of lighterage facilities for ferrying crude oil on Lake Maracaibo, and also to the production of lubricants from Venezuelan crude at Curacao and in the United Kingdom (paragraph 22 and Appendix V).(g.) The dependence of the Empire on the U.S.A. and Venezuela for oil and refined products in time of war gives cause for great uneasiness. If U.S.A. is &quot; unfriendly &quot; and withholds supplies, the dependence on Venezuela becomes alarming (paragraph 22 and Appendices IV and V).(h.) The additional oil required by Japan as an enemy Power would not seriously affect our position in regard to obtaining oil at suitable sources of production, but it would increase the demand on the limited world tanker tonnage (paragraph 6).(*.) Under the scheme of supply and distribution proposed in this Report it is possible to reduce slightly the tanker tonnage requirements of the Empire as shown In the 2nd Annual Report of the Oil Board (paragraph 27 and Appendix VI).
31. Recommendations.We therefore recommend that: (1.) Reserves of fuel and lubrioating oils be accumulated in time of peace to meet the anticipated needs of all the Fighting Services of the Grown and for the manufacture of munitions during the first year of hostilities.(2.) Every encouragement be given to the installation and development of petroleum refineries in the United Kingdom and countries under the British flag overseas.(3.) In all dealings with the Persian Government the necessity to the Empire of full accessibility to Persian oil supplies be kept constantly in mind.(4.) Reliable data should be collected of civilian oil requirements in the Dominions, Colonies and Dependencies.(5.) Schemes for rationing civilian oil requirements be prepared by the respective Governments of the Empire ready for institution on the outbreak of war.STANHOPE (Chairman). J. W. L. OLIVER. E. J. FOLEY.

Appendix III.CAPABILITIES OF THE PERSIAN FIELD AND ANGLO-PERSIANREFINERIES (1927).; THE following information has been obtained partly from official sources and partly by informal enquiries from the Anglo-Persian Oil Company.The actual production of crude oil from the Persian oil-field in 1927 was 5,210,000 tons, which, it is understood, could have been increased by 100 per cent, or even more if there had been means of transporting the crude from the field to the coast. Unfortunately, however, the present pipe-line could not have carried more than a maximum of 7,000,000 tons. Moreover, the refinery at Abadan, which dealt with 3,364,821 tons of crude during 1927, could not have treated more than 4,500,000 tons. This would have left 2,500,000 tons of crude oil to be carried away and refined elsewhere.The 4,500,000 tons of crude refined at Abadan would have yielded Tons.Petrol (20 per cent.)    ... ... ...        900,000Kerosene (12 per cent.)... ... ...        540,000Fuel Oil (64 per cent.) ... ... ...      2,880,000Practically the whole of the Petrol and Kerosene produced at Abadan would have been available for allocation against Empire requirements, but the following essential services would have had to be met in the case of the fuel oil, viz.: Tons.Local deliveries ...         ...         ...         ... 90,000Abadan Refinery Consumption      ...         ... 140,000 (Estd.)Bunkers required at Abadan for tankers removing surplus crude and the fuel and light   products   allocated   for   civilianrequirements     .....         ...         ... 200,000 (Estd.)430,000This would have left only 2,450,000 tons of fuel oil for allocation against Empire requirements.The disposable surplus of the various products that could have been produced at Abadan in 1927 are, therefore, as follows :      -Tons.Crude ... ... ... ...      2,500,000Petrol ... ... ... ...        900,000Kerosene       ... ... ... ...        540,000Fuel oil        ... ... ... ...      2,450,0006,390,000Particulars of the 19.27 throughputs (in terms of tons of crude) of the other refineries controlled by the Anglo-Persian Company, and the possibilities of rapid expansion have been obtained from the Company, and are shown below : Llandarcy GrangemouthUphall Laverton (Australia)Actual	Possible	MaximumThroughput (1927).

There should, however, have been no difficulty in arranging for any balance of crude from the Persian Field that could not have been dealt with by the Anglo-Persian Company being refined by other refineries in England (e.g., Thameshaven, Southampton). Similarly, it should have been possible to arrange for refineries in Australia -(including Laverton) to deal with a total of 100,000 tons crude; 250,000 tons Persian crude could possibly have been treated at the Suez refinery of the Shell Company and another 400,000 tons at the Rangoon refinery of the Burmah Oil Company.Generally speaking, it will be seen that the AbadaU refinery, with the help of the Australian, Rangoon and Suez refineries, would have been able to provide from Persian crude for all the Petrol and Kerosene requirements for both the Fighting and Civilian Services of the Empire East of Suez; and there would still have been considerable surpluses of these products that would have had to be transported elsewhere. The fuel oil produced at Abadan, however, would only have been sufficient to meet about half the needs of the Fighting Services East of Suez, even if all of it could have been appropriated for military service, and civilian requirements in the East disregarded.[19158]F
Appendix IV.CONSIDERATION OE THE POSITION (1927) IF U.SA. HAD BEEN a friendly NEUTRAL.THE annexed Statement A shows the proposed distribution of crude, and a suggested allocation of refined products from the estimated crude output of the Persian field in 1927 on the understanding that U.SA. had been a friendly neutral.Statement B, following, shows the quantities of crude and refined products which would have had to be obtained from Oil exporting Countries mainly outside the influence of the British Empire, together with the suggested sources of supply. These requirements, however, would have been met to the extent of 68 per cent, by the continuance of the normal exports of oil to the British Empire from such countries, as shown in Statement C.The remaining 32 per cent., vide Statement D, would have had to be met by increased buying on the open market. The exports of producing countries to the British Empire can be augmented in three ways, viz., either by (a) Increasing production, or (b) Increasing quantities available for export by economy in con-sumption in country of origin, or (c) Increasing supplies to the British Empire at the expense of other importing countries. As regards (a), production in the United States, Venezuela, Roumania and Trinidad has been increasing during the last few years, and, as there is a large potential production in proved areas in the three first-named countries, there is little doubt that sufficient supplies would have been forthcoming, especially as the prospect of rising prices due to the war would have stimulated production.

CONSIDERATION OF THE POSITION IN 1927 IF U.SA. HAD been an UNFRIENDLY NEUTRAL.IF the U.S.A. had been an unfriendly neutral, and supplies of crude oil and refined products had been unobtainable from that country, the position would have been most critical.Drastic rationing would have been inevitable. Rationing in the U.K. would have reduced the total Empire requirements of crude and refined products to about 17,384,000 tons.In 1926 the production of crude oil in the United States of America was 106,474,000 tons, and imports of crude oil were 8,626,000 tons. During the same period 120,200,000 tons of home and imported crude oils, together with partly refined oil, were put through the refineries and yielded the following products : (Thousands of tons.)Fuel and Gas Oil.

In these circum-
stances, and in view of the close inter-connection between Canadian and U.S. oil concerns, it is most probable that Canada would obtain her normal supplies from the U.S. despite any restriction of export to other parts of the Empire.Even with supplies being made to Canada on a normal basis, the cessation of export to other parts of the British Empire would have caused serious inconvenience to the U.S. oil trade.British Refineries in the East.All the refineries in the East under British control (except Miri, Sarawak, which for military reasons could not have been relied on) would have been fully employed dealing with Persian or Indian crude.Canadian Refineries.The throughput capacities of the Canadian refineries in 1926 were 2,778,000 tons. To keep these refineries fully employed Canada would have imported 1,825,000 tons of crude from the U.S.A., and the balance, 953,000 tons, from Peru, Colombia and Venezuela. The products of these Canadian refineries would only have partially satisfied Canadian and Newfoundland requirements. The balance of requirements for these two countries would have been met by the import of refined products from the U.S.A., as under normal peace conditions.United Kingdom Refineries.The estimated throughput capacities of the refineries in the U.K. in 1927, in terms of crude, Avere about 3,650,000 tons. Taking into consideration the 157,000 tons of crude from the Scotch Shale works, and the 1,750,000 tons of Persian crude brought from Abadan, there would have been a refining capacity for about If million tons of crude still available. This surplus refinery capacity could have been utilized during the first year of war by the import of crude from Venezuela, where there is a large &quot; shut-in &quot; production.The refineries in the U.K. would produce from 1,750,000 tons of Persian crude and If million tons of Venezuelan crude, the following refined products, viz. : Products from U.K. Refineries.

It may be assumed that during the first year of hostilities 1 million tons crude could have been dealt with under (6) process, and the remaining f- million tons under (a) process.

Russia has been disregarded as, in a contingency such as that now under consideration she also might be unfriendly to the British Empire.Trinidad.Enquiries made of Trinidad Leaseholds, Limited, the: Company handling the greater part of the production of Trinidad, elicited the information that&apos; this particular group, with their associated companies, had an emergency occurred during-1927, could have produced 1,000,000 tons of crude oil, and-an estimate that the other companies in the Island could have produced another 190,000 tons. This,total of 1&quot;, 190,000 tons would have yielded the following quantities of products if they had been put through the local refineries, namely : Tons.Petrol ... ... ... ...      119,250White Spirit and Kerosene ... ...        81,500Light Gas oil  ... ... ... ...       32-250Fuel and i Gas oil. ....      ... ...      957,000It is-anticipated that in 1927 the Trinidad Leaseholds&apos; refineries could have dealt with 840,000 tons in the year: and that the other, companies&apos; refineries could have dealt with another 160,000 tons, so that there is no doubt that, with small additions to the refining capacity which could have been secured during: the year, the whole of the yield could have been refined locally.[19158] g

(Civil).50,000      23,000 Colonies (W.).27,000 U.K. (Civil).Venezuela and Dutch West Indies (i.e., Curacao and Aruba).It is necessary to consider the Venezuelan production in conjunction with the neighbouring Dutch Islands of Curacao and Aruba for the following reasons : The crude oil is produced from the territory adjacent to the shallow waters of Lake Maracaibo, and after local requirements are satisfied at the small refinery of San Lorenzo, the remainder of the oil is transported in the form of crude in light-draught vessels to (a) Curacao, where the Royal Dutch-Shell Group have a very large modern refinery, and (o) Aruba, where the crude oil won by the American companies operating in Venezuela is transhipped to ocean tankers for conveyance to refineries in the United States and Great Britain. Practically the whole of the American companies&apos; production goes to United States ports, only 400,000 tons having reached Great Britain during 1927 according to His Majesty&apos;s Customs import figures.In 1927 Venezuela produced just over 9,000,000 tons of crude oil. Of this total 4,859,859 tons were handled by the Shell group, of which the greater part was refined at Curacao, the remaining production having been obtained by American companies and exported as crude as explained above.Enquiries elicited the fact that, while Venezuelan crude oil is of very varying types, the proved production of crude oil is so large that it can be governed to suit the fluctuating requirements of trade or of His Majesty&apos;s Government. The following is an approximation of the products yielded on refining heavy Venezuelan oil, viz. : 10 per cent, petrol and 90 per cent fuel oil. This 90 per cent, could be further split up into 30 per cent, of light gas oil, 30 per cent, of lubricating distillate capable of producing excellent lubricants of all classes, and the remainder would be a thick asphaltic substance only fit for roads. It must be emphasised that these lubricants can only be made in suitable types of refining plant, such as the Shell Group have now in operation at Curacao and Shellhaven. The 30 per cent, gas oil can be mixed with the heavy asphalt to form a thick commercial fuel oil.It was further ascertained that production of crude could be increased enormously, given the necessary time, personnel and plant. Speaking generally, no appreciable increase could be made in the first six months, but, after that, the yield could be increased by 50 per cent., and progressively thereafter as long as necessary. The personnel required would principally consist of American drillers, and the plant would also be mainly of American origin. In the same way, the refinery capacity could not be greatly augmented during the first six months, but after that could keep pace with production. Some of this refining plant might have to be manufactured m Germany.The throughput of the Curacao refinery was adequate to deal with the oil produced by the Group in 1927 plus that purchased from the British-Controlled Oilfields, Ltd., which, together, amounted to the 4,859,859 tons mentioned above, and it is accordingly assumed that with 6.J million tons of crude available, not less than 4,000,000 tons of refined products would have been obtainable during the year from Curacao with the Company working at full pressure. It is computed that, in order to meet the Empire requirements, refining should have been on the following lines, namely : 750,000 tons of crude to be treated with a view to obtaining their lubricating oil contents, yielding 75,000 tons of petrol, 225,000 tons lubricants. 450,000 tons commercial fuel oil; the remaining 3,250,000 tons to obtain the maximum quantity of fuel oil, i.e., 90 per cent., giving 325,000 tons of petrol andIt is, therefore, proposed to assume that the following products could have been exported to meet Empire requirements during 1927, namely : 
2,925,000 of fuel oil. tons as follows : Fuel and Gas OilThis would have made the total products from the 4,000,000PetrolLubricating OilTons. 3,375,000400,000 225,000Proposed Allocation. 2,377,000 Military (W.). 39,000 New Zealand. 44,000 Colonies (E. and W.). 703,000 U.K. and Irish Free State.

Taking into consideration decreases in production, due partly to the intrusion of salt water into the main producing fields and partly to political influences which have prevented the big oil companies developing their concessions at the normal rate, it is deemed unsafe to have expected to have obtained much over a million tons of fuel oil from this country. The only British group operating in Mexico on any considerable scale is the Shell group, and although their crude production amounted to about 1% million tons in 1927, a third of this quantity was of a very heavy character, more suitable for use on roads than as fuel. It might possibly have been rendered suitable for fuel if sufficient quantities of gas oil had been available to mix with it. The refinery capacity under the control of the Shell Group is more than sufficient to deal with present production.Tons.

This production is almost entirely in the hands of the International Petroleum Company of Canada (a subsidiary of the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey) and of the Lobitos Oil Company, a purely British concern, which, however, at present is understood to sell practically all its production to the International Petroleum Company. This latter Company operates a considerable refinery at Talara with a reported throughput of over 2,000 tons per day, or, say, 700,000 tons per annum, and is understood to do practically all the refining that is carried out in Peru.The exports of petroleum products for six months of 1927 are reported as follows : Crude Petrol Kerosene .

The crude oil was equally divided between Canada and the United States. Most of the fuel oil went to South American countries, but about 40,000 tons were consigned to Canada, and 17,000 tons were used as bunkers;; -

On the basis of actual 1927 exports to Empire destinations and Egypt, plus the whole 50 per cent, increase, it is considered that we should be justified in anticipating obtaining the following products from Roumania : Fuel and Gas oil PetrolKerosene - ..

(Ditto.)40,000      Australia;-Conclusions as to Possibilities of obtaining. Supplies.The: enclosed Statement E- shows the suggestedL sources from which Empire requirements could have been met.If the extra drilling and extension of refineries in Trinidad, Venezuela and the Dutch West IndieSi forecasted in the foregoing, had matured in 1927, we should have been able to meet all essential Empire requirements except 5,000 tons of lubricants for Australia and 4j000 tons of lubricants for India and Ceylon. It has been ascertained, however, from the Burmah Oil Company that they could have produced another 5,000 tons of lubricants at Rangoon. This would have met the unsatisfied requirements of India and Ceylon and reduced the Australian deficit to 4,000 tons. This shortage might have been shared by imposing rationing cuts on lubricants required by the United Kingdom and other Dominions.It must not be forgotten that the Lubricating Distillates, obtained :at both West Indian and United Kingdom refineries from Venezuelan crude, would have required further refining, and that-for a considerable period there would have been a distinct shortage until supplies under the new arrangements became available. This shortage would have been&apos;: felt; more-acutely i at the.more distant Dominions and Colonies dependent, on lubricating; oils obtained from Venezuelan crude.The -withdrawal of supplies by theU.S.A:. would have caused such a dislocation of the normal scheme of production, refining, and distribution, that serious shortages of all products would have been felt throughout the Empire until the new arrangements for supply and distribution could nave been perfected.Owing to its excellent lubricating oil content, the crude oil is normally exported to Canada and the United States lor refining, while considerable quantities of Californian fuel oil are imported into Peru for bunker purposes and for the nitrate companies. In the event of? an embargo onthe export of oil from U.S.A. to the British Empire, the large exports of refined products from California to Australia and New Zealand would be cut off and these products would, therefore, be available for South American oountries. It is assumed that the following quantity of fuel oil could have been secured from Peru : Tons. Proposed Allocation.Fuel oil .. - -        40,000 New Zealand.Apparently only sufficient lubricating oils are refined at Talara to meet local needs and those of immediately adjoining countries, and it would not be safe to assume that this refinery could turn out large quantities of lubricants (although the Peruvian crude oil is eminently suited to such treatment) without the building of additional plant. Possibly this might be done by the Lobitos Oil Company either in Peru or on its oil-field in Ecuador.
Russian supplies would have been specially valuable to tide over the period until full production could have been obtained from Venezuela, and the extensions necessary for refining Venezuelan crude in the Dutch West Indies and United Kingdom completed.[19158]hRussia.This dislocation would have been slightly eased if we could have obtained supplies from Russia, which, in 1926-27, exported approximately-Gf which U.K. took-Tons.

Appendix VI.SHIPPING CONSIDERATIONS (1927).OWING to the estimated increases in the production of Persian crude oil and the refineries&apos; throughput for 1927, as indicated in Appendix IV, and in order to carry out the scheme for distribution proposed in Statement A, it would have been necessary to vary the transport arrangements set out in the Second Annual Report of the Oil Board.In arriving at an estimate of the gain or loss in tankers resulting from the new scheme for distribution, due regard has been had to the increase or decrease in the times occupied in the voyages of the tankers concerned, and the following are the necessary adjustments: 1,706,000 tons of fuel oil, an increase of 506,000 tons, would be carried from Abadan to the Far East for Naval services instead of from U.S.A.      ... ...      15 less tankers.231,000 tons of fuel would be carried from Rangoon to eastern Naval services instead of from IT.S.A.      ...        9 ,,144,000 tons of fuel would be carried from Suez to EasternNaval services instead of from U.S.A.      ....      ...        3   ,,      ,,Against this gain in tankers employed for carrying Naval fuel must be set the extra tankers required for carrying 1,750,000 tons of crude from Abadan to U.K. This requirement can be met up to 1,008,000 tons by a 21 days&apos; diversion of the tankers carrying fuel from the TJ.K. to the East on their homeward voyage, and for the remaining 742,000 tons of crude by diversions equivalent to 32 days per cargo for vessels carrying fuel from America to the East. These arrangements would necessitate an increase of 2 tankers after allowing for the 15 tankers mentioned in the Second Annual Report in connection with the conveyance of 1,500,000 tons of crude oil from Abadan to ILK. ... ... ... ...      2 extra tankers.Similarly, the carriage of 250,000 tons of crude to Suez would entail diversion of 21 days per cargo   ... ... ... ... ...      2 extra tankers.The carriage of 400,000 tons of crude from Abadan to Rangoon would entail employment of ... ... ... ... ...      5 extra tankers.The carriage of Persian crude under the new scheme would, therefore, entail the employment of ... ... ... ... ... ...      9 extra tankers.The carriage of 250,000 tons of extra crude to U.K. would release in the U.K. 80,000 tons extra of Petrol and Kerosene for civilian requirements and would save the transport of equivalent quantities of these products from America to U.K. ... ... ... ... ... ... 2 less tankers.As the whole of the fuel oil content of the 1,750,000 tons of Persian crude brought to the U.K. has been allocated for the purposes of Naval services in the East (including bunkers for the tankers required for the carriage of such oil), it would have been necessary to import 960,000 tons of fuel oil from America to make up the loss of the fuel oil content of the 1,500,000 tons of Persian crude which in the Second Annual Report of the Oil Board had been allocated for civilian consumption.This would have meant further requirements of 20 tankers, but against this increase there would have been a set-off amounting to 11 tankers through carrying 1,008,000 tons of fuel oil from U.K. to the East instead of America to the East. The net result in this case would have been an extra requirement of    ...      9 tankers.

Appendix VIII.MEMORANDUM BY BOARD OF TRADE AS  TO POSITION UNDER EXISTING COMMERCIAL TREATIES.IT is a common practice to include in commercial treaties a provision to the effect that no prohibition or restriction shall be imposed on the exportation of goods from the territories of one Party to the treaty to the territories of the other Party which does not apply equally to exportation to any other foreign country. Thus, under the Commercial Treaty of 1815 between Great Britain and the United States of America, the United States would be debarred from prohibiting the export of oil to Great Britain if they allowed it to go to other foreign destinations; and, in order to be relieved of this obligation, the United States would have to terminate the treaty, which would require twelve months&apos; notice. There are no such treaty obligations in the case of Mexico, Russia, the Dutch. East Indies or Peru, but there are treaty provisions which we could invoke in the case of Venezuela, Roumania, Colombia, the Argentine and Poland, if those countries discriminated against us in the matter of export prohibitions or restrictions. As regards Persia, the treaty position is somewhat doubtful pending the conclusion of the commercial treaty now in course of negotiation, in which it is proposed to include the usual Treaty Clause.It should be noted, however, that the treaty provisions above referred to are of a reciprocal character. In the event of war we might (as in the Great War) find it difficult or impossible to fulfil our obligations, and might therefore not be in a good position to insist on our treaty rights. For example, we might find it necessary to impose prohibitions or restrictions on the export of rubber or tin, and to operate them in such a way that it became difficult for us to object to the way in which an oil-producing country administered a prohibition or restriction on the export of oil.Board of Trade, December 13, 1928.
ANNEXURE   &quot;B.&quot;Benzol.Its Nature, Origin, Production, Distribution and Importance.1. Benzol is substantially a mixture of benzine, toluene and xylenes. The first named compound is solid at 0oC. and boils at approximately 80oC. The other constituents of the mixture melt below the freezing point of water and boil at higher temperatures than benzine. Mixtures of hydrocarbons marketed under the commer-cial description of benzol, though similar, vary slightly in the proportions present of the above three main constituents.2. Benzol is a bye-product in the destructive distillation of bituminous coal. This distillation is undertaken industrially primarily for the production of either metallurgical coke or coal gas, and the major portion of benzol made in the United Kingdom originates in the coke ovens, or, strictly speaking, from coke oven tar. Many of the coke ovens and gas works send their tar to tar distillers, who produce therefrom benzol creosote pitch and many other bye-products. Pulverised and washed coal is rammed into red-hot and continuously fired ovens, from which issues gas containing ammoniacal liquors, light and heavy oils. The last named are partly obtained by condensation and partly by &quot;scrubbing&quot; the gas with creosote oil. Although the method and duration of the retorting for the production of coal gas differs materially from that employed for the manufacture of blast furnace coke, the method of freeing the gas from light oil is similar. Very little benzol is, however, now obtained by &quot; scrubbing &quot; gas. The bulk of the benzol is contained in the &quot;light &quot; oil dissolved by the creosote. The former is driven off from the solution by heat, condensed and washed with caustic soda and sulphuric acids to remove impurities. It is then subjected to fractional distillation. The quantity of rectified benzol produced from a ton of coal varies from 1-J to 2J gallons according to the type of coal employed.3. There are about 150 firms engaged in producing benzol, chiefly collieries, possessing coke ovens, and their works are chiefly at or near the pit heads in Durham, Yorkshire and South Wales. A few of the gas companies have such plants, but in most cases the smaller gas companies sell their tar to tar distillers for treatment. A large coking plant, such as that of Dorman Long &amp; Co., Ltd., at Middlesborough, produces approximately 2,000,000 gallons of benzol annually, whereas the output of a large gas company, such as the South Metropolitan Gas Co., averages about 250,000 gallons per annum. In certain cases colliery companies have decided to market foundry coke, and to that end have erected coke ovens at the pit head. The residual tars of the coking process are sent to a central tar distilling plant, where the benzol, creosote, pitch, &amp;c, are extracted and refined. Some of these arrange-ments are on a co-operative basis, and were set up primarily to secure a new direct market for the coal industry. One such plant belonging to the British Tar Products Co., Ltd., is situated at Cadishead (near Manchester), and its output of benzol is at present about 2^ million gallons annually. This plant takes the residuals from about 100 pit head coke ovens situated in various parts of Yorkshire and Derbyshire.4. The tar is distilled for its various bye-products. From the crude naphtha thus obtained is distilled the crude benzol, from which is obtained the refined benzol used as motor spirit. Many of the coke ovens and gas works do not produce refined benzol, but sell their crude benzol to the tar distillers for further treatment. Crude benzol is distilled into the following products : (1) benzol; (2) toluol; (3) solvent naphtha; (4) heavy naphtha, &amp;c. Formerly solvent naphtha was sold to the rubber companies, but these companies are now using white spirit distilled from petroleum to a large extent in place of solvent naphtha, so that the latter is at present thrown in with the benzol and toluol fractions to form the quality of benzol sold for motor spirit. In this way out of 100 gallons of crude benzol only 65 gallons suitable for dyeing purposes would be produced, but 75 gallons of motor benzol would be forthcoming. The heavy naphtha is used for making compositions for coating ships&apos; bottoms.

The Air Ministry requires benzol as an addition to Aviation Spirit on account of its &quot; anti-knock &quot; qualities. The proportion of benzol in the complete mixture is at present 20 per cent., and it is probable that the amount may be increased m the near future. The total annual requirements of the Royal Air Force are at EJft &amp;h?v* 750,000 gallons, 500,000 gallons being needed at home and about ^5U,000 gallons being shipped abroad, chiefly to Iraq. In the event of a great war it [19158]5. Owing to the incidence of the production of benzol as a bye-product the existence of a selling agency to market the finished product is inevitable. The National Benzole Co., which controls about 95 per cent, of the benzol supplies in the United Kingdom, are agents for most of the coking firms ^and gas companies. This company has bulk storage at South Bank (Middlesborough), Manchester, Sunderland, Keadby and elsewhere, in which supplies from the members of the National Benzole Association are concentrated, and from which distribution is made. Most of the benzol in the hands of this company is mixed with petrol and sold throughout the country as National Benzole mixture.6. During the late war a certain amount of benzol was used for the manufacture of phenol for picric acid, though by far the greater proportion of phenol used was obtained from coke ovens and coal tar. in a Far Eastern war, or a war on the basis given the Principal Supply Officers Committee, natural phenol (obtained from coke ovens and coal tar) would meet all requirements. The demand for explosives in war must, in fact, increase the supply of benzol, as scrubbing plant would have to be introduced into gas works for the extraction of toluol, and benzol is found in combination with the toluol as a result of the scrubbing process.7. The production of benzol in Great Britain was small prior to 1914, but in 1918, during a period of great activity in the steel trade, it exceeded 140 million gallons. The following Table A shows home production, imports, exports, re-exports and balance retained. The latter figure may be taken as fairly representative of consumption. Information as to stocks is not available, but it is not considered that they would vary much year by year.
is estimated that atleast 700,000 gallons would be required in the first month, with a reserve of 6 million gallons, say 20,000 tons. The monthly consumption would rise to 1,800,000 gallons in six months and 4,400,000 gallons at the end of the first year. The Flying Services did not use benzol in the late war, although at the end of the war a small stock of 100 tons was kept for Royal Air Force purposes at Portishead.9. The stimulus to steel production consequent on military activity would result in an increased output of benzol, but its very nature as a bye-product, and the relatively unexpansible character of coking plants, renders any great increase out of the question. The extreme vulnerability of coking plants from the air is a factor which may still further jeopardise benzol supplies.10. Summary of Estimated Air Ministry Requirements.Tons.(a.)

As regards War Office requirements, it may be mentioned,&apos; although experiments have been made and continue to be made in the army to standardise one or more spirits for use in war, no definite results have been obtained to date. At the present time benzol is used as a partial fuel for both tanks and dragons, at the rate of 25 per cent, benzol and 75 per cent, petrol. On this basis the War Office peace time requirements of benzol are at present 47,750 gallons (say 160 tons), but this amount will increase as mechanisation develops.12. In the event of a war in the Far East (5 Division basis) the estimated requirements of the War Office for petrol-benzol mixture are as follows : Benzol at 2o per cent.Includes 2 Months&apos; Mixture of Mixture.Reserves.

In the event of a war where the rate of expansion would be similar to that given the Principal Supply Officers Committee for the estimation of their

The principal Civilian uses of benzol, outside purposes of motor transport by land and air, are understood to be in dye-making, for which benzol is essential, the manufacture of the new lacquer paints, in the rubber waterproofing trade, in the treatment of leather. &amp;c. The material used as a rubber solvent is really the fraction of the crude benzol known as solvent naphtha, but the use of this solvent is being discontinued in favour of white spirit, derived from petroleum, except by the old fashioned firms. As a consequence, the major part of the solvent naphtha is now put back in the motor benzol, and it is also bought by the petrol distributing companies to add to their motor spirit. Reliable trade authorities reckon that about 85 per cent, to 90 per cent, of the benzol used annually in this country is consumed for motor transport (including aviation), and the remainder, which amounted to about 5 million gallons in 1927, for the above purposes.Summary of Situation in time of War.15. Summarising the position in time of war, it would appear from the fore-going estimates of the Air Ministry and War Office that, as regards use in internal combustion engines, their joint requirements for the first year of a great war in the Far East would not amount to more than about 11 million gallons, or about half the home production in 1927, and, in a war on the basis given the Principal Supply Officers Committee about 23^ million gallons, or nearly the whole of home production to-day. No doubt the supply in war time would be stimulated by increased activity in the iron and steel industries, and could be further augmented by special arrangements with gas companies and other producers, so that an estimated output of 30 million gallons would be a conservative figure; hence there would be no difficulty&apos; in meeting the foregoing requirements for aerial and land transport. Moreover, it seems probable that so long as petroleum substitutes for benzol were available for industrial purposes there would be no difficulty in cutting out civilian requirements altogether in war time, except, perhaps, for dye-making (which is believed to account for about 4 million gallons in peace).16. It is improbable that any benzol will be required for the manufacture of explosives in the wars contemplated in this paper, as the picric acid required could all be manufactured from the natural phenol recovered from coke ovens and coal tar.[19158]

Since this report has been compiled, information has been received from a very reliable source that there is a large and influential body of people in the United States who are pressing for a bill to be presented to Congress forbidding the export to belligerents of any natural resources of the United States.   This would include oil.If such a bill should ever be passed it would affect Canada (if a belligerent) very greatly.   This should be borne in mind when reading this report.Fot&amp;uoord.1. THIS report has been compiled with a view to providing information which may be useful to the Oil Board of the Committee of Imperial Defence in further consideration of the requirements and imports of oil of Canada.2. An effort has been made to present data to conform with the general trend of the first and second annual reports of the Oil Board, but due to the present small requirements of the Fighting Services in Canada and the uncertainty of their future development, totals only are shown representing both civil and military requirements.3. Quantity figures quoted have been obtained from statistical tables of Dominion Government Departments, from information supplied by Canadian oil companies, and.by a study of ships&apos; manifests.4. Estimates of requirements based on information obtained in conversation with officials of oil companies are higher than are shown by Government tables, and reports based on Government returns may, therefore, be safely assumed to be not over-stated.5. Tons quoted are 2,240-pound tons. Estimates of the number of tankers required are based on the actual cargoes carried during eight months of 1928. The high average of cargo capacity is accounted for by the large capacity tankers operated by the Imperial Oil (Limited). It will be noted that the average of the total tanker cargo carried is 10,000 tons. The figure of 335 days, as average ship&apos;s yearly operating time, is used.
Oil Requirements of Canada.  .6. No attempt has been made to estimate requirements under a scheme of rationing, as Oil Board reports indicate that the least possible disturbance of civil requirements is desired, and because it appears quite possible that a very considerable portion of requirements, if not all, might be obtained by Canada overland from the United States if necessary.7. Oil imports by Canada are approximately 50 per cent, by ocean tanker and 50 per cent, overland, the latter including that received by railway, pipe line and lake tanker. Imports overland are wholly from the United States, while those by tanker are approximately 37 per cent. California, 48 per cent. Gulf (Venezuela, Colombia, Mexico, Texas and Dutch West Indies), and 15 per cent. Peru.Exports.8. The export total for the year ending the 31st March, 1928, was 92,000 tons^ of which 69,000 tons was classed as crude. Part of this might more properly have been listed as &quot; stripped &apos; crude, as there is included in this item the residue of imports of United States crude from which the petrol has been taken by Canadian refineries.  Crude exports may be proportioned as follows : 35,000 tons to U.S.A. from middle west provinces. 13,000 tons to U.S.A. from Toronto and Sarnia. 21,000 tons to United Kingdom from St. John, N.B.69,000 tons-total.9. The balance of 23,000 tons represents coal, oil and kerosene refined, gasoline and naphtha and &quot; other &quot; oils, of which 7,000 tons went chiefly to the United States and 16,000 tons to Newfoundland.10. This export total of 92,000 tons represents only 2 per cent, in proportion to total imports, and, as the bulk of that figure was originally imported from the United States by rail, it is therefore considered that the import total by ocean tanker would not be affected to any perceptible extent and exports may be completely disregarded in estimating Canada&apos;s requirements by ocean tanker.11. The amount to be deducted as exports from imports for the purpose of estimating Canada&apos;snet import requirements, less the 16,000 tons to Newfoundland, is approximately 76,000 tons.Imports.12.   Estimates of amounts of imports by various manner of conveyance are asfollows: 1,ogs &quot;&quot;iTG&amp;rBy seaboard     ... ... ... 2,083,000 1928*By railway      ... ... ... 975,250 1927By pipe line    ... ... ... 825,950 1927By lake tanker ... ... ... 80,000 1927Total ... ... ... 3,964,20013. This estimate, compared with Government reports, is approximately 130,000 tons short of the amount of total imports reported for the year ending the 31st March, 1928.14. Figures, as shown above, for oil entering Canada by seaboard, pipe line and lake tanker are considered to be fairly reliable, but due to the large number of distributers, in addition to refineries, that are concerned in imports by railway, it is impossible to obtain an independent estimate.15. The Government report of railway imports does not include oil brought in for use by railways, but the amount is not thought to be large. The oil used by engines in the Rocky Mountains is brought in by tanker via. Vancouver.* Note.   Does not include oil for use by railways.
16. The balance of total imports over exports for the year ending the 31st March, 1928, is slightly more than 4,000,000 tons, while the imports by ocean tanker for the year 1928, estimated by reference to ships&apos; manifests,* are as follows:  mTons.To Vancouver, B.C.....     ... ... 800,000To Montreal, P.Q.......... 675,000To Halifax, N.S.......... 525,000Total by tanker ... ...      2,000,00017.Tankers Required for the Conveyance of Oil Assumed to be Necessary in 1928 to canada.Requirements.

While the present proportion of tanker imports is fifty per cent, of total imports, the expectation is that tanker imports will represent sixty per cent, by 1937, attributed to the probable increased development of South American fields. This proportional increase has, therefore, been assessed in the above table to requirements from Gulf (Venezuela, &amp;c.) and Peru.* Note.-Ships&apos; manifests for 1927 are not available.t Note. &quot;Gulf&quot; includes Texas, Mexico, Venezuela, Colombia and Dutch West Indies.

The tanker fleet of the Imperial Oil Limited registered in Canada comprises nine ocean-going ships and six lake ships. One new lake ship is contemplated for 1929.5. The combined capacity of the nine motor tank ships is approximately 152,000 tons, while the six canal size steam driven ships have an average capacity per ship of 2,680 tons. During 1927 these six lake ships transported 508,700 tons of oil, being continuously in service during the season of navigation. They are employed in the movement of refined products for refineries at Halifax, Montreal and Sarnia.6. One lake tanker is operated by the McColl-Frontenac Company, which makes two round trips per week between United States lake ports and Canadian ports, having a capacity of 6,000 barrels (895 tons).7. A contract has been awarded to the Furness Shipbuilding Company, England, for a two-thousand-ton-capacity steel tanker for service on the Great Lakes. Delivery is to be made on the 1st April, 1929.Oil Pipe Lines United States to Canada.8. Only two pipe lines cross the border from United States to Canada, both of which are owned by, and supply refineries of, the Imperial Oil, Limited.9. One line enters Canada from the State of Montana with its terminal at Coutts, Alta., having a maximum capacity of 1,117 tons per twenty-four hours, and the other line crosses St. Clair River, terminating at Sarnia, Ont., with a maximum capacity of 2,606 tons per twenty-four hours.Consumption of Oil in Canada.Contributing Causes of Increasing Consumption.10. The consumption of oil is affected to a great extent by the very large number of American tourists who travel extensively on Canadian highways, and the number is increasing yearly. An oil company estimates that one million American motor cars entered Canada during 1927 and consumed thirty million gallons of petrol in this country. As prohibition in the United States is largely responsible for this influx of tourists, a change in the Volstead Act, permitting in some form the sale of intoxicants in the United States, would tend to decrease the number of American cars on Canadian roads, with a consequent effect on the consumption of oil in Canada.11. The estimated number of new motor cars in Canada averaged 80,000 cars per year for the years 1918 to 1924. During 1925 the figure was 102,110, during 1926 158,577, and during 1927 157,832.
12. Whether it is a case of following American custom or because of the advantage of better roads, it is apparent that Canadians are now spending more time in automobile travel than was the case a few years since. Long week-end tours are general, and constant use of the automobile is made for business, shopping and pleasure.f3. The use of oil furnaces in private homes (large and small) as well as in business houses is becoming very popular, and motor car fuel tanks now form part of the fuel merchant&apos;s regular equipment.14. Consumption of fuel oil by railways has increased enormously, due to the use of oil-burning engines and diesel-electric trains.Past estimated Consumption and Annual Increases. 15. Annual Consumption of Oil for Past Three Years.Balance of imports over exports plus crude production : Years ending  March 31, 1926 March 31,1927 March 31,1928Tons. 2,820,000 3,380,000 4,070,000It will be noted that the increase of annual consumption is roughly 20 per cent. Of the 1927 figure, it is estimated that about 1,400,000 tons of naphtha and 62,000 tons of lubricating oil were used by motor transport, and 521,000 tons of fuel oil were supplied to ships&apos; bunkers at Canadian Ports.16. Particulars of future oil imports by tanker will be tabulated by this Division, and this should within the next year provide a comparison which will indicate the actual trend of increasing requirements.Future Predicted Consumption.17. To predict what the consumption is likely to be in 1937 is necessarily difficult and must depend on many eventualities, but providing no change occurs in Canada&apos;s immigration policy, it is anticipated that total requirements may be in the nature of between 8 and 11 million tons, and that some 60 per cent, of this oil will be carried by tankers.Production of Petroleum Industries in Canada.18. For the year 1927 the crude used by the industries were 66,520 tons of Canadian crude and 2,981,862 tons of imported crude. ,19. Certain products of the industry made for sale during the year 1927 were: Gasoline for saleGasoline for petroleum industry use Petroleum spirits for sale Kerosene for sale       ... ...Kerosene for industry use        ...   -Fuel and Gas oil for sale Fuel and Gas oil for industry use Lubricating for sale   ...

It is suggested that, in the event of a world shortage of tanker tonnage, Canada might be in a position to obtain all her requirements from the United States overland, thereby releasing the tankers employed to Canadian ports for use elsewhere, and the production of South American fields to supply the demands of other parts of the Empire. To meet such a situation a very large increase of tank oars would be required, and Canadian oil companies would be faced with the necessity of arranging new contracts in United States fields.23. While the railways of Canada own approximately 500 tank cars, a very large number are owned by oil companies on which the railways allow free trans-portation on return when empty.24. The present transportation of oil into Canada&apos;by rail is 500,000 tons of crude by tank car and approximately the same amount of distillate by package freight, practically all confined to the three interior provinces.
25. Should the railways be required to carry the amount of oil now being moved by ocean tanker, the rail lines affected would evidently be from California to Vancouver and from Lake Erie area to Montreal and Halifax. To the Lake Erie area oil is piped from the fields to Sarnia, Toledo, Cleveland and Buffalo, and it seems reasonable to suppose that the movement of oil to Montreal and Halifax might partly.be carried by lake tanker during the season of navigation.26. If the problem of obtaining all oil overland is considered of sufficient importance, a study of the question can be conducted from the point of view of transportation and supply of refinery requirements.
ANNEXURE &apos;*f&apos; ).Memorandum on the Turkish Petroleum Company-&apos;s Concessions in -Iraq prepared by the petroleum department of the board of trade.1. UNDER the terms of their concession from the Iraq Government, the Turkish Petroleum Company are bound to order a pipe-line as soon as it shall be commercially justifiable, and complete its construction as soon as practicable. The Groups comprised in the Company have agreed that, as soon as sufficient oil production has been secured to justify, in the opinion of the Board of the Company, the construction of a trunk pipe-line, the Turkish Petroleum Company will proceed, through one or more of its general Operating Companies, with the construction of a pipe-line to a Mediterranean port, together with the necessary gathering lines. (It should be noted that, under the terms of their Concession, the Turkish Company are at liberty to form one or more subsidiary companies for the working of the Convention. As. a matter of fact, the Groups comprised in the Turkish Company have agreed that the actual working of the oil fields in Iraq shall be carried out bv one or more Operating companies and that the pipe-line shall be constructed by an Operating Company. Generally speaking, these Operating companies will be representative of all the Groups comprised in the Turkish Company, but in special cases in which all the Groups may not wish to participate a &quot; Special Operating Company &quot; may be formed representing some only.)2. The Concession from the Government of Iraq covers the whole of Iraq except the &quot;Transferred Territories&quot; and the Basra Vilayet. In the Transferred Territories oil has, of course, been found, but is not being worked to any considerable extent owing to the absence of transport facilities. In the Basra Vilayet there is probably no oil, at any rate no interest is at present being taken in this area. Under the terms of the Concession the Turkish Company have to select 24 plots for exploitation by a specified date, and other plots in the area of their Concession may be put up to auction. The lessees of such other &quot;plots are&quot; entitled to 30 per cent, of the capacity of the pipe-line. It should be noted, however, that there is nothing to prevent nominees of the Groups comprised in the Turkish Company from bidding for such plots outside the 24 selected in the first instance by the Turkish Company. If such nominees were successsful at the auctions and they transferred their leases to Operating Companies, or if (as is contemplated) the American Group or its associated companies bid successfully for plots which they decided to retain and develop on their own account, it would mean that a larger proportion than 70 per cent, of the pipe-line would be available for Companies representing the same oil interests as the Turkish Company itself, with a corresponding reduction in the capacity utilisable by independent Companies. In fact, it might very well happen (as, no doubt, is the wish of the Groups comprised in the Turkish Company) that the whole of the pipe-line capacity and the whole of the plots worked in the area of the Concession would come into the hands of the Groups which form the Turkish Company. At this date, however, it is obviously impossible to say what will happen.3. If the pipe-line capacity were not completely taken up by the Companies operating in the area of the Concession, it would no doubt be possible for the Anglo-Persian Oil Company operating in the Transferred Territories to make an agreement with the Pipe-line Company for the carriage of their oil from the Transferred Territories to Haifa. On the other hand, the Anglo-Persian might construct their own pipe-line independently from the Transferred Territories to Haifa (possibly in part along the same route as the Turkish Petroleum Company&apos;s pipe-line, with which there might be a junction somewhere in Iraq with a line from the Persian oil fields). Were this plan adopted, the long sea voyage around Arabia and the payment of a very large sum annually to the Suez Canal Company would be avoided in the case of Persian oil sent west of Suez.4. Neither the Turkish Petroleum Company nor the Operating Companies above referred to will refine oil in Iraq or at the Mediterranean terminal of the pipe-line, except small quantities for local consumption. They will instead sell the crude oil produced to the Groups comprised in the Turkish Company or the Operating Companies in the proportion in which the Groups hold shares in the
Anglo-Persian Group      ... ^q0^&apos;Royal Dutch Shell Group ... &apos;&quot; %%&apos; 1% French Group    ...      P ... g-^American Group ... &quot;&apos;Gulbenkiap23-75 5-00It should be noted, however, that the Anglo-Persian Group has a first claim to 10 per cent, of the crude oil produced from the 24 plots selected by the Turkish Company, or other plots chosen by the Anglo-Persian in exchange for such selected plots. Assuming that the entire production was from the 24 plots, the Anglo-Persian would be entitled to 10 per cent., plus 23-75 per cent, of 90 per cent, of that oil, that is to say their total share would be 31-37 per cent, of that oil, but it is, of course, impossible to say how many plots will, in fact, be worked and what proportion of the total oil production of Iraq will be from the 24 plots selected by the Turkish Company as distinct from the plots put up to auction.5. There is nothing to prevent any of the Groups or their associated Companies from owning or operating refineries at the terminal of any main pipe-line at a point accessible to tankers, and it is believed that large refineries would probably be constructed by the Anglo-Persian at Haifa if that were the terminal of the pipe-line, but the intentions of the other Groups with regard to refining at Haifa are not known.
Printed for the Committee of Imperial Defence.   May 1929.SECRET.Copy No.  58COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE.Extract from the Minutes of the 242nd Meeting, held on May 2, 1929.**(2.)-oil fuel: SUPPLY AND CONTROL.(C.I.D. Paper No. 937-B.)(Previous Reference : C.I.D. Minutes of the 234th Meeting, Minute 1.)THE COMMITTEE had under consideration the Third Annual Report of the Oil Board (C.I.D. Paper No. 937-B).LORD PEEL said that the Report dealt with four different items. These consisted of firstly, the importance of benzol; secondly, the oil requirements of the Dominions and Colonies; thirdly, Empire oil supplies in war; and fourthly, the effect on the oil supplies of the Empire in war should an oil pipeline be constructed from Baghdad to the Mediterranean.The first part of the Report regarding benzol indicated the very great importance of benzol for both aircraft and motor transport. There were two specific recommendations which the Oil Board made for the approval of the Committee of Imperial Defence. The first that the Principal Supply Officers Committee, who were preparing a list of articles for which export should be prohibited, except under licence, as soon as war was declared, should place benzol on that prohibited list. The second to invite the Board of Trade to prepare an order under the appropriate Defence Regulations to enable gas works to reduce the calorific value of the gas they provided, which was necessary should benzol be extracted at gas works, and that the order should be forwarded to the War Emergency Legislation Sub-Committee.The next item of the Report dealt with the Oil requirements of the Dominions and Colonies. A very comprehensive report had been supplied by His Majesty&apos;s Government in Canada on this subject which would prove of the greatest value; a less detailed report had also been received from South Africa. It was essential if the requirements of the Empire in a maritime war were to be met that the co-operation of all parts of the Empire in matters of the purchase, refining and distribution of oil should take place, and that the Oil Board should have accurate information regarding requirements of the different parts of the Empire. With these objects in view the Board recommended that the Governments of the Dominions and Colonies should be invited to forward annually certain information which was detailed in paragraph 12 of the Report, and that on the occasions of the next Imperial Conference and Colonial Conference the subject of co-operation should be taken up as part of a discussion on matters of Defence.The next part of the Report, which dealt with the supplies, source of production and tanker tonnage in relation to the oil requirements of the Empire in time of war, had been the main business of the Board during the past year. A Sub-Committee, with Lord Stanhope as Chairman, had gone into the question in great detail and elaboration, and considerable research Tiad proved necessary. The scheme for meeting Empire oil requirements had been investigated under two hypotheses, firstly, that the United States was friendly, and secondly, that the United States was unfriendly.   It would be seen that, in either event, considerable difficulty would
occur in meeting requirements, and that in either event there would be a period when supplies could not be ensured. Should the United States of America prove unfriendly, it would only be possible to meet demands by the introduction of severe schemes of rationing. The Oil Board drew the attention of the Committee of Imperial Defence to certain points in paragraph 18 of the Report, and pointed out once more the importance of our having one year&apos;s oil reserve for the Fighting Services in our possession before war was actually declared. They advise, in view of the shortage of refining plant within the Empire, that every encouragement should be given to the installation and development of petroleum refineries on British soil, and they also ask that the Principal Supply Officers Committee should forward to the Oil Board the estimated requirements in lubricating oil for the manufacture of munitions during the first year of war. The Oil Board had been much impressed by our dependence on foreign countries for practically all our lubricating oil, and also by the statement of Mr. Tizard, of the Department of Scientific Research, regarding the importance of obtaining the different grades of lubricating oil that were needed for different forms of machinery. The Oil Board had recommended that the War Office and Air Ministry should be invited to consider the advisability of building up a reserve of lubricating oil to meet their requirements during the first year of war.The last part of the Report, which dealt with the effect of the construction of an oil pipe-line from Baghdad to the Mediterranean, had been undertaken by the Oil Board by direction of the Committee of Imperial Defence at its 234th Meeting. The Oil Board had come to the definite conclusion that it was of the greatest importance that this pipe-line should have its terminal at Haifa. Provided such a terminal were arranged, they had estimated that, if only the minimum of oil were found in Iraq to justify the pipe-line, the Empire could rely upon receiving no.lesser amount than 2,000,000 tons of oil from this source. This pipe-line would not only serve the fields that were in Iraq, but also the Anglo-Persian Oil Company&apos;s field in the Transferred Territories, and might even carry their supplies from South Persia. In view of these circumstances, the Board had stated that it would be of first importance to the Empire in a maritime war that the oil pipe-line from Iraq should have a terminal at Haifa.There was one further point he would like to make, and that was regarding the control of oil in time of war, which had been raised in the recommendation regarding benzol. By the terms of reference of the Committee, it was laid down that the On Board should, after a certain amount of reconstitution of its personnel, carry out the duties of controlling and rationing oil supplies. It was clear, however, that the Board would have to come under some Ministry to enable executive action to be taken on its recommendations; he thought this would probably be the Board of Trade, but the whole question would be gone into in the near future and an organisa-tion for the control of oil. supplies would be worked out.SIR WARREN FISHER said that, from the Treasury point of view, he hoped that the approval of the Report by the Committee of Imperial Defence would not result in any immediate action being taken which would entail expenditure. The hypotheses on which the Sub-Committee had worked were distinctly, alarmist, for they assumed a war with Japan, in which no supplies would be available from the United States of America, Russia or the Dutch East Indies. The likelihood of our being in such a parlous position was, he suggested, not warranted if the despatch from Sir Esme Howard, which appeared as Item 12 on the agenda (C.I.D. Paper No. 934-B), meant anything. Further, the Committee had to recollect that the policy which had been accepted regarding the preparation of estimates of the Service Departments was that there would not be a major war for 10 years.SIR HUGH TRENCHARD observed, that the Air Ministry were of the same opinion as the Treasury with regard to any immediate expenditure. He suggested that, in view of the fact that the Principal Supply Officers Committee were basing their calculations on the hypothesis of a war against Russia in Afghanistan, the Oil Board should be asked to prepare a. scheme for meeting oil requirements in such a war.        -&apos;,::^!\   ^ ... .\-.,,.Mr. BRIDGEMAN said that, so far as immediate action was concerned, under the present rate of accumulation of fuel oil for the Navy, it would take some 32 years to build up the reserves required, and he felt the Committee of Imperial Defence should be aware of this situation.   He had had a conversation with Lord Melchett
regarding the possibility ; of lubricating oil being produced by the process of hydrogenatioh now being developed by Imperial Chemical Industries. Lord Melchett had informed him that he was not aware of the need for manufacturing lubricating, oil in Great Britain, and he would take steps to make investigations in this direction. He (Mr. Bridgeman) had informed Lord Melchett that if Imperial Chemical Industries ^could produce the right kind of oil for the Navy, the Admiralty would&apos; probably be in a position to purchase stocks from them.GENERAL CHARLES remarked that there was one point on page 8 of the Report to which he would like to draw attention. This was with regard to the &quot;War Office considering the advisability of building up a reserve of lubricating oil. The amounts required by the War Office would, in any event, be very small, and, owing to the small turnover in peace, it might not be economical for the War Office to build up a reserve, but he suggested that, as the Navy had to collect a considerable amount of lubricating oil, the requirements of other Departments might be pooled and placed under the charge of the Admiralty. It would not be difficult for the necessary financial adjustment to be arranged between Departments.SIR HORACE HAMILTON stated that the Board of Trade took a very serious, view of our dependence on other countries, particularly the United States of America,! regarding the supply of lubricating oil, and he suggested that, when the Principal Supply Officers Committee were approached to give the estimates of lubricating, oil required for the manufacture of munitions, they should also be invited to indicate the amount that would be required for civil purposes.Mr. AMERY called the attention of the Committee to the recommendation in paragraph 18 (/) (ii) of the Report, regarding the desirability and need for co-operation between all parts of the Empire in the purchase, refining and distribu: tion of petroleum products, and suggested that the subject might, On the occasion of the next Imperial Conference, first be raised at a meeting between the Oil Board and the service representatives of the Dominions in London; and the recommenda-tions arrived at should then be brought up before the Committee of Imperial Defence for the consideration of the Governments. He could not agree with Sir Warren Fisher that no immediate action should be taken on the recommendations of the Committee of Imperial Defence on the Oil Board Report, at any rate so far as they bore on the construction of a Baghdad-Mediterranean pipe-line. It was becoming an urgent matter that some action should be taken to ensure that the terminal of the pipe-line should be at Haifa. The construction of a railway from Iraq to the Mediterranean would, in all certainty, determine the alignment which will be taken by the pipe-line, and, as the Committee knew, the French were already considering the construction of a railway from the Euphrates to the Syrian Coast. It was, therefore, a matter of urgency that a decision should be reached by His Majesty&apos;^ Government regarding the construction of a railway from Haifa to Baghdad. He had prepared a Memorandum on the subject for the Cabinet, and the Report now submitted by the Oil Board strengthened his arguments in favour of. prompt action. He also drew the Committee&apos;s attention to page 47 of the Report regarding the production of benzol in Great Britain, which showed that, although the actual home production at the present moment was bnlv 26,000,000 gallons, the amount produced when the steel industry was exceptionally active during the late Avar was in the nature of 140,000,000 gallons. As the production of benzol was directly affected by the output of the iron and steel industries, and our requirements of benzol in war were so much greater than we were able to produce to-day, it was of importance that every assistance should be given to the iron and steel industries.SIR MAURICE HANKEY asked that, when preparing their scheme for control of oil in war, the attention of the Oil Board should be drawn to the principles which had been laid down by the Principal Supply Officers Committee on thissubject.SIR AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN observed that he had no detailed remarks to make regarding the Report, but he had a few points on the broader aspect of world politics. He fully appreciated that the Committees of the Committee of Imperial Defence had to prepare for any conceivable war, and the Oil Board had taken their most difficult war, namely, a war with Japan. In his view, however, war with Japan was so unlikely in present circumstances that this country need not in practice take any immediate measures of defence against such a contingency. By far the most dangerous point in the world was Russia, where, with its internal state as it [19243-1] b 2
was, it was impossible to tell what might happen in the future, and he&apos; was glad that the suggestion had been made that the situation should be considered by the Oil Board from the point of view of oil requirements in the event of a war with Russia in Afghanistan. He did not wish Members of the Committee who had not been present on the last occasion of his giving the Committee a review of our foreign relations to imagine that His Majesty&apos;s Government considered a war with Japan to be in any way likely.He was in full agreement with the Secretary of State for the Colonies with regard to the urgency of coming to a decision about the construction of a railway from Baghdad to Haifa, and, although no decision could be come to at this meeting, he hoped the necessary action would be taken before long.The Report clearly emphasised our dependence on the oil-fields in Persia for obtaining the oil we required, and he hoped that the Departments, when considering items of a minor kind now being negotiated with Persia, would bear in mind the broader aspects of the problem, and he invited them to yield where possible, so as to ensure our obtaining the most cordial relations with that country. We could only be assured of obtaining the oil supply we needed in war if a complete understanding existed between the two countries.Mr. BRIDGEMAN remarked that he hoped that, in our agreements with Persia, it would be made possible for us to send forces into the Persian oil-fields, so as to give them protection should the necessity arise.SIR GRANVILLE RYRIE stated that the Australian outlook, so far as oil was concerned, was a precarious one. The refineries in the country only dealt with a small percentage of the oil actually used; all the remainder was imported by private companies. There were, however, large deposits of shale, which might be used in war, should the import of oil prove impracticable, but in peace it was not an economic proposition to obtain oil from this source. In answer to a question from Mr. Bridgeman, he said that good facilities for transport existed from the shale areas. The production of benzol from brown coal was not considered a practical proposition at present.Mr. EOTJW said that it might be of interest to the Committee of Imperial Defence to know that the South African Government were taking steps to obtain oil from their very large deposits of coal. The Prime Minister of His Majesty&apos;s Government in South Africa had recently announced the decision of that Govern-ment to proceed with an oil research institute. One or two experts had been sent already to examine developments in the United States and Germany, where the Bergius system was being advanced. It could be anticipated that they would be producing oil from coal in South Africa within a reasonable time.THE PRIME MINISTER observed that these developments were of con-siderable importance, and would, without doubt, prove of great value to the Union of South Africa.SIR AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN asked that the information just given to the Committee by Mr. Louw should be communicated to the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research.LORD STANHOPE pointed out to the Committee that, whether the United States was friendly or unfriendly, our difficulties in obtaining sufficient crude and fuel oil would be considerable. On page 31 of the Report it was pointed out that, if the United States were friendly, there would be a deficiency of some 4,752,000 tons of crude oil, and the pessimistic view taken by the Sub-Committee of the Oil Board in its report was therefore fully justified. On page 30 of the Report, in Statement C, our dependence upon the United States of America and Venezuela were clearly demonstrated.SIR AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN remarked that, should the United States be unfriendly, it would be very unsafe for us to rely upon getting any oil from Venezuela.LORD PEEL stated that it had been essential to give the Sub-Committee certain hypotheses on which to work, and the situation from the point of view of the United States being friendly or unfriendly was given them&apos; in order to bring out our
dependence upon supplies from that country. He pointed out that no expenditure would he incurred by the adoption of the Report by the Committee;1 all they asked, so far as lubricating oil was concerned, was that an investigation by the Departments concerned and the Principal Supply Officers Committee should be made.SIR WARREN FISHER said his remarks applied only to sub-para-graph 18 (e), which stressed the importance of a one year&apos;s supply of oil fuel for the Fleet.LORD PEEL remarked that this conclusion merely bore out the statement that had previously been made on this subject, and which had been adopted by the Committee of Imperial Defence on former occasions. ,THE PRIME MINISTER said that the Committee owed a debt of gratitude to Lord Peel and his colleagues on the Oil Board and Oil Board Sub-Committee for the comprehensive report which had been prepared by them. He did not consider that the approval of the Report by the Committee need cause any anxiety to the Treasury, as no action could be taken which would entail expenditure unless Cabinet approval had first been obtained. The different recommendations that had been made at the meeting would be circulated in the usual way to the Departments and Committees concerned. With regard to lubricating oil, he hoped that a stimulus would now be given to its production in this country.Conclusions. The Committee of Imperial Defence agreed (1.) To approve the Third Annual Oil Board Report (C.I.D. Paper No. 937-B).(2.) That the Principal Supply Officers Committee should be informed of the need for placing benzol on the List of articles for which export is to be prohibited, except under licence, as soon as war is declared.(3.)

(7.) To invite the War Office and Air Ministry to consider the advisability of building up a reserve of lubricating oil to meet their requirements during the first year of war, and, should such a reserve be considered necessary^ to examine the feasibility of arranging that the Admiralty should 1 maintain the stocks on their behalf.(8.) To request the Principal Supply Officers Committee to prepare and forward to the Oil Board an estimate of the quantity of lubricating oil which will be required during the first year of war for the manufacture of munitions and for the civilian population of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.(9.)
