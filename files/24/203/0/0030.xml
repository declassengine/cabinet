Printed for the Cabinet.   May 1929.SECRET.Copy No.28CP. 130 (29).CABINET.INTERNATIONAL LABOUR CONFERENCE-ELEVENTH SESSION.Draft Convention and Recommendation concerning the Creation of minimum wage-Fixing Machinery.I SUBMIT for the consideration of my colleagues the following proposals as to the action to be taken by the Government in regard to the Draft Convention and Recommendation adopted by the Eleventh Session of the International Labour Conference. The text of these documents has already been presented to Parliament as Command 3209 of 1928, and a summary of the provisions of the Draft Convention will be found in the Report of the British Government Delegates, Command 3226 of(1.) Draft Convention concerning the creation of Minimum Wage-Fixing Machinery.This Convention requires the setting up or maintenance of machinery whereby minimum rates of wages may be fixed for workers employed in certain of the trades or parts of trades (and, in particular, in home working trades) in which no arrangements exist for the effective regulation of wages by collective agreement or otherwise and wages are exceptionally low. For the purpose of this Convention the term &quot; trades &apos;&apos; includes manufacture and commerce.The placing of this question on the Agenda of the Conference was due to the persistent efforts over a number of years by the representatives of His Majesty&apos;s Government on the Governing Body, and is a further proof of the determination of the Government to protect the standard of living of workpeople in this country by bringing Continental standards more nearly up to our own. The Convention leaves each Member who ratifies it free to decide (a) in which trades or parts of trades the minimum wage-fixing machinery shall &apos; be applied;(6) the nature and the form of the machinery and the methods to be followed in its operation (though these are the subject of the Recommendation which follows);with a proviso that the representatives of both Employers and Workers shall be consulted before the machinery is applied, and shall be associated in its working in equal numbers and on equal terms.The Draft Convention imposes no obligations other than those already imposed by existing legislation in Great Britain, which is considerably in advance of the requirements of the Convention. No objections have been received from any quarter, and there would appear, therefore, to be no obstacle to its immediate and unconditional ratification by His Majesty&apos;s Government, which I recommend accordingly.Memorandum by the Minister of Labour.1929.[19224]
(2.) Recommendation regarding the Application of the Wage-Fixing MachineryThe Recommendation contains a number of detailed suggestions as to the methods to be adopted in the application of the Minimum Wage-Fixing Machinery Of these, only two call for any comment: (i.) Paragraph 2 (a) of A. II lays down that independent persons appointed to a wage-fixing body &quot; should, as far as possible, be selected in agreement with or after consultation with the Employers&apos; and Workers&apos; representatives on the wage-fixing body.&quot;The Appointed Members of Trade Boards are appointed by me and I am under no obligation to consult the Trade Board before making these appointments. The acceptance of the claim embodied in this Recommendation would in all probability prove to be a source of real embarrassment to my Department. Our representatives spoke and voted at Geneva against the inclusion of these words, and there can be no misunderstanding if w:e refuse to accept them now.(ii.) The first paragraph of Part A. Ill reads :  &quot;For the purpose of determining the minimum rates of wages to be fixed, the wage-fixing body should in any case take account of the necessity of enabling the workers concerned to maintain a suitable standard of living. For this purpose regard should primarily be had to the rates of wages being paid for similar work in trades where the workers are adequately organised and have concluded effective collective agreements, or, if no such standard of reference is available in the circumstances, to the general level of wages prevailing in the country or in the particular locality.&quot;The Trade Boards Acts do not lay down any criteria by which the Boards are to be guided in fixing minimum rates. In fact, there is no doubt that they do take into consideration the factors mentioned above along with others, and though it is true that we have no power to compel them to do so, I feel satisfied that we can accept this Section of the Recommendation.I therefore propose that His Majesty&apos;s Government should accept the Jlecommehdation, with the exception of the stipulation referred to in (i) above.(Initialled) A. S.-M.Ministry of Labour, May 1, 1929.
