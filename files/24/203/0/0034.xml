Printed for the Cabinet,   May 1929.SKUttET.Copy No.  28CP. 134 (29).CABINET.THE OIL POSITION IN IRAQ:   TRANS-DESERT PIPE-LINE AND RAILWAY TO THE MEDITERRANEAN.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.MY colleagues will remember that the Memorandum on the above subject which I circulated to the Cabinet on the 11th March (CP. 73 (29)) contained a copy of a letter from Sir H. Dobbs, the retiring High Commissioner for Iraq, recording a conversation in February last with the High Commissioner for Syria. Sir H. Dobbs reported that M. Ponsot informed him that the French Government had decided to build at an early date a railway from Horns to the Euphrates, the terminus of which would be either Abu Kemal or Deir-ez-Zor. I explained at the time that this report was of importance as indicating the lengths to which the French Government were prepared to go in order to influence the Turkish Petroleum Company in favour of the adoption of an alignment through Syria for their pipe-line to the Mediterranean. Since Sir H. Dobbs&apos;s letter was circulated, a certain amount of information (mainly from secret sources) has been received, all of which points to the fact that the French are really in earnest in their professed intention to build a railway across the Syrian desert to the Euphrates. That such is their intention has recently received confirmation from the British Liaison Officer at Beyrout, who has reported that two experts from Paris have lately arrived in Syria to study the question of constructing the railway.2. At their Meeting of the 20th March, the Cabinet decided, inter alia, that the British Ambassador at Paris should make it clear to the French Government that His Majesty&apos;s Government did not conceal their desire for the adoption of Haifa as the terminus of a pipe-line and railway, and that they reserved their full right to promote this end by such means as the complete or partial construction of the railway, a guarantee of interest or a subsidy, or other methods of a similar nature. The decision to make this pronouncement (which might be expected to have the effect of stimulating the French to press on with railway construction in Syria), was, I think, prompted by something more than the mere desire to provide for all possible future contingencies. There was, I think, a definite intention underlying it. The general feeling of the Cabinet, as I understood it, was that, if. in order to get the Baghdad-Haifa railway built it was essential that His Majesty&apos;s Government should provide some measure of financial assistance, financial assistance should be forthcoming.3. Hitherto His Majesty&apos;s Government have relied upon that fortunate identity of British and Iraqi interests upon which I remarked in the memorandum which I circulated to the Cabinet on the 24th April (CP. 125 (29)). For reasons other than those influencing His Majesty&apos;s Government, the Iraq Government wish to see a railway built to Haifa, and have shaped their policy vis-a-vis the Turkish Petroleum Company to that end.   Taking advantage of this happy coincidence, His[19235] b
Majesty&apos;s Government have been content to stand aloof, leaving the Iraq Govern-ment to do all the work, while expecting themselves to secure the major part of the reward. In short, they are trying to get something for nothing, which is rarely a successful policy. To allow the execution of a vital Imperial purpose to depend upon the vagaries of Iraqi local politics is clearly in the highest degree unsafe. King Faisal and his Ministers are, no doubt, eager to secure the construction of a railway from Baghdad to Haifa. But who can say how far this eagerness may not&quot; have evaporated six months hence&apos;? With a person of King Faisal&apos;s mercurial temperament, momentary pique with His Majesty&apos;s Government might be enough to put him into the opposite camp. Moreover, the fundamental weakness of our position is accentuated by our self-denying ordinance to the French. If the need arises, we can no longer very well bring political pressure to bear on the Iraq Govern-ment to keep them in the straight path. But even if the Iraq Government&apos;s attitude towards the Baghdad-Haifa Railway remains unchanged, is it not asking too much to expect that, in the face of the determined opposition of the French Government, they will succeed in persuading an unwilling oil company to go outside its normal sphere and build a highly speculative railway across a desert ? Clearly, the risk of failure is considerable, and, having regard to the important Imperial interests involved, I submit that the risk is one which His Majesty&apos;s Government are not justified in taking.His Majesty&apos;s Government must, I consider, abandon their attitude of detach-ment and put their hands in their pockets, since it is evident that the only certain way of ensuring that the Baghdad-Haifa Railway is built is for His Majestv&apos;s Government to contribute towards its cost.4. Once that railway is built, it seems almost certain that, whatever may be the internal dissensions within the Turkish Petroleum Company, the pipe-line from the Iraq oil-fields will eventually follow the railway, unless, of course, in the mean-time the French project for a railway from Horns to the Euphrates has materialised, in which event it is conceivable (although to my mind unlikely) that the Company would choose the Syrian route. In any case, the construction of the Baghdad-Haifa railway would certainly ensure the adoption of that route for the Anglo-Persian Oil Company&apos;s pipe-line connecting the great Persian oil-fields, and the new oil-field in the Transferred Territories in Iraq, with the Mediterranean. To secure that end alone would, I think, justify some considerable expenditure of Imperial funds upon the Baghdad-Haifa Railway. If Great Britain were involved in a war in which France occupied the position of a neutral, the product of the oil-fields of Persia and the Transferred Territories would, I imagine, be sufficient to meet our essential naval and military needs, although in such circumstances arrangements could probably be made with the French Government for our oil tankers to load with oil from the Iraq fields at a Syrian port. On the other hand, if France were in the enemy camp, it should not be a difficult matter to cut any pipe-line from the Iraq oil-fields to a Syrian port and to deflect the oil along the Anglo-Persian Company&apos;s pipe-line following the route of the Baghdad-Haifa Railway.If these premises are correct, namely (1) that by promoting the construction of a railway from Baghdad to Haifa we could ensure that at least the Anglo-Persian Oil Company&apos;s pipe-line followed that route (and probably the Turkish Petroleum Company &apos;s pipe-line also); and (2) that the product of the oil-fields of Persia and the Transferred Territories would be adequate for our needs; then I do not think that it can be questioned that in order to ensure the construction of that railway this country might reasonably be expected to make some financial sacrifice.5. Financial assistance might take one of two forms. Either His Majesty s Government might guarantee, wholly or in part, the capital required, and thus accept an indefinite liability of a character which I believe to be particularly objectionable to the Treasury, or they might directly subsidise the enterprise to the extent of agreeing to meet a proportion of the interest charges on capital during the period of construction and the first few years of pioneer development. I recommend the latter course. PBrigadier-General Sir H. O. Mance, who carried out in 1927 on behalf oi Sir Albert Stern (with whom are associated Messrs. Schroders, &amp;c), a preliminary
investigation into the question of constructing a Railway from Baghdad to Haifa, estimated that, including the cost of survey, this could be carried out at a cost of  8 000,000, and that a year or two after the opening of the Railway (he anticipated that the railway could be built in three years) the undertaking should show a return, of about 3 per cent, on capital, and 7 per cent, after ten years. Sir Albert Stern has professed himself ready to proceed with the project if His Majesty&apos;s Government will guarantee annual contributions by the Iraq and Palestine Governments, which altogether would represent 4 per cent, on the capital to be raised, these contributions to continue for the first 50 years of the enterprise. The proposal that the Iraq and Palestine Governments should subsidise this undertaking for so long a period as 50 years can scarcely have been intended to be taken altogether seriously; it was probably put forward to serve as a basis for negotiation and with full expectation of its rejection. There is, however, much to be said for a Government subsidy during the period of construction and early development. Financiers cannot be expected to put up so large a sum of money on an enterprise of this character unless they can safely count upon some immediate return on their money, or unless they are confident of very large future profits. On the basis of Sir II. O. Mance&apos;s report there seems little prospect of any very large return on capital during the first ten, or even twenty, years-of the enterprise.6. Palestine cannot at present afford any subsidy which would count in the balance. Iraq, in a few years&apos; time, might be both able and willing to contribute to an undertaking from which she would derive considerable economic advantage; but until the Railway is open and actually carrying goods and passengers to feed the Iraq Railway system and swell the local revenues, any idea of a substantial subsidy by the Iraq Government may be ruled out as impracticable. It seems not unlikely that Sir Albert Stern or others could be induced to undertake the con-struction of the Railway if they could be assured of a subsidy representing 4 per cent, of the capital involved during the first five years and a progressively reduced subsidy during the following five or ten years. The Iraq Government might, I think, be prepared to produce the latter subsidy if His Majesty&apos;s Government were ready to provide the subsidy during the first five years (i.e., from the beginning of con-struction). This would involve on the part of His Majesty&apos;s Government an annual contribution of some  300,000 for five years. As I have attempted to show, by the expenditure of this sum there is reason to believe that the Empire would be assured of an adequate supply of oil for purposes of defence in case of war.7. This expenditure would, moreover, serve another and more immediately beneficent purpose. It would cause several millions of money to be spent upon railway material with the heavy industries of this country, and would thus materially contribute to the relief of unemployment. For that reason the proposal might, I think, properly be brought within the scope of the proposed Colonial Development Connnittee and the expenditure met from the fund which that Committee would administer. The railway project cannot, however, be allowed to stand or fall upon its merits as a commercial venture or as a contribution to the relief of unemployment. In this case economic criteria must give place to the more important consideration of Imperial strategy.8. I do not suggest that we should look no further in this matter than Sir Albert Stern and his associates. There may well be other groups willing and capable of carrying out the project at less cost to Imperial funds. I would not propose at this stage to tie the hands of those charged to negotiate the arrangement on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government, but should leave it to their discretion either to negotiate with Sir Albert Stern or with the Turkish Petroleum Company, with the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, or even with the B.O.D.9. Urgency is, however, of the essence of the problem. Once it becomes known that the French have really decided to build a Railway from Horns to the borders of Iraq, the knowledge will undoubtedly act as a deterrent to the construction of a Railway from Baghdad to Tlaifa. &quot;The construction of two railways across the desert could not but lead to cut-throat competition. It is doubtful whether, even without a Syrian rival, a railway from Baghdad to Haifa would be commercially remunerative; it is almost certain that if there were two trans-desert railways neither would pay its way.   Should, therefore, confirmation of the rumours of the[19235]   &apos; b 2
French Governments intention reach British groups interested in the Baghdad-Haifa Railway project, they would be the less disposed to proceed with that project and the more exorbitant in their demands for Governmental financial assistance Consequently, any delay in offering that assistance and any delay in coming to a definite agreement with the prospective concessionaires is likely to prove costly to His Majesty&apos;s Government. &quot;I fully appreciate that the negotiation of an agreement governing so wide-reaching a proposal and involving the expenditure of Imperial funds must inevitably take time. Clearly such an agreement should not be hastily conceived Careful preliminary study, involving consultation with the Governments of Iraq and Palestine, will be necessary. The negotiations with the prospective concessionaires will probably be protracted, and many months may elapse before final agreement is reached and the construction of the railway put in hand. There is. however, one step which could, I think, profitably be taken in advance of definite agreement with the concessionaires. I think that, if His Majesty&apos;s Government were to finance a survey of the Haifa-Baghdad route, using for that purpose railway Engineers of such eminence and repute as would ensure that the results of the survev would be accepted without question by any group which might subsequently obtain the concession, this would not only be generally regarded as an earnest of their determination to see the project carried through, and thus influence the Turkish Petroleum Company in favour of that route for their pipe-line, but it might effectively discourage the French from proceeding with their own plan for a railway to Deir-ez-Zor. The French Government could not fail to realise that a second trans-desert railway would be unremunerative, particularly as the Iraq Government would probably decline to extend the Iraq railway system to connect up with it. Moreover, even if the French were prepared to face the financial loss, they could not count upon the Turkish Petroleum Company deciding to adopt that route for their pipe-line.10. The cost of a detailed survey was estimated by Sir H. 0. Mance at slightly over  100,000. The Iraq Railway Directorate, on the other hand, consider that it&quot;could be carried out for something in the neighbourhood of  30,000. In any case, the amount involved is relatively small; it could, moreover, be ultimately recovered from the group which obtained the railway concession.I do not suggest, however, that His Majesty&apos;s Government should finance the survey so long as there is a real prospect of anyone else being ready to do so within a reasonable time. When the Iraqi Cabinet resigned on the question of the Military and Financial agreements, they had before them an offer by the Turkish Petroleum Company to carry out a detailed survey of the Baghdad-Haifa route in return for the grant of an extension of time within which to select plots for development. The Iraqi Cabinet, although prevailed upon to remain temporarily in office pending the appointment of another Ministry, have consistently refused to deal with matters other than those of a purely routine nature. Consequently, they have declined either to accept or to reject the Turkish Petroleum Company&apos;s offer. That offer, so far as I know, still stands, although, as my colleagues are aware, the French are using all the influence at their command to secure its withdrawal.11. I have just learnt that King Faisal has been successful in forming a new Ministry, but that does not necessarily mean that the new Cabinet will reach an early decision in the matter of the Turkish Petroleum Company&apos;s offer. They will, I imagine, have a sufficiently difficult time resisting attacks in Parliament against the decision (of which the Cabinet were informed in my Memorandum of the 28th March, CP. 103 (29)) to abandon the Anglo-Iraq Treaty of 1927, and to maintain m force the agreements of 1924, without wishing to introduce highly controversial matter such as the Turkish Petroleum Company&apos;s application for an extension, which will inevitably invite a good deal of hostile parliamentary criticism. Probably they will temporize, and postpone a decision from week to week and from month to month until the opportunity is finally lost. In this matter we cannot afford to wait upon the vacillation of the Iraq Government, and I suggest that, if within (say) three months from this date no final agreement has been concluded between the Iraq Government and the Turkish Petroleum Company whereby the latter will be definitely bound to carry out a survey of the Baghdad-Haifa route, His Majesty&apos;s Government should come forward with an offer to the Iraq Government to finance the survey themselves.
012. To sum up, the conclusions which I have set out to establish and which I now ask the Cabinet to accept are (a) that the construction of the Baghdad-Haifa Railway cannot be assured without financial assistance from His Majesty&apos;s Government;(&amp;) that&quot; financial assistance should take the form of a contribution towards interest on capital, preferably to be found from the proposed Colonial Development Fund; and(c) that, if within the next three months no agreement is reached between the Iraq Government and the Turkish Petroleum Company which will ensure the carrying out of a detailed survey of the Baghdad-Haifa route, His Majesty&apos;s Government should themselves offer to find the funds for such a survey.L. S. A.Colonial Office, April 30, 1929.
