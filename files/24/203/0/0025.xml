Printed for the Cabinet.   April 1929.SECRET.Copy No.28CP. 125 (29).CABINET.OIL POSITION IN IRAQ.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.1. AT their meeting of the 13th March, 1929, the Cabinet requested me to cause a memorandum to be prepared and circulated to show, inter alia, &quot; whether any pressure had been put by the British Government on the Iraq Government to insist on Haifa as the terminal port of the railway and pipe-line.&quot; On the 16th March I circulated (CP. SO (29)) an &quot;Historical Note&quot; prepared in my Department summarising the correspondence and negotiations which had led up to the present situation between the Iraq Government and the Turkish Petroleum Company and to the dispute with the Trench Government. In my covering memorandum I stated that I did not think that anyone reading the Historical Note could be left with the impression that His Majesty&apos;s Government had exercised any such pressure upon the Iraq Government. At the Cabinet meeting held on the 20th March it was decided that a complete disclosure of the evidence should be made to the Trench Government to prove to them that they were wrong in believing that political pressure had been put by His Majesty&apos;s Government on the Government of Iraq to insist on the Haifa alignment for the pipe-line and railway as one of the conditions of an extension of the period of time allowed to the Turkish Petroleum Company for the selection of plots for development, and that this condition was imposed spontaneously by the Iraq Government.2. Since that decision was reached my attention has been drawn by the Foreign Secretary to a letter written by the High Commissioner for Iraq to King Eeisal on the 10th August, 1928 (Appendix E), which he considers throws doubt upon the statement in my memorandum of the 16th March that no pressure had been brought to bear upon the Iraq Government to cause them to insist upon Haifa as a terminal port for the proposed railway and pipe-line. He has pointed out that in that letter Sir Henry Dobbs, in commenting on certain undesirable features in a Resolution by the Iraqi Cabinet (Appendix D) on the subject of proposals recently submitted by the Turkish Petroleum Company, used the following words : &quot;In any event, it seems necessary for paragraph 4 of the Resolution of the Council to be amended so that it shall stipulate that Haifa shall be the terminus of the railway. The Resolution, as it stands, merely stipulates that the railway shall be &apos; to a certain port on the Mediterranean,&apos; which would permit of its being a port in Syria. I understand that this is contrary to the wishes of Your Majesty and of the Iraq Government, and it is important that the point should be made clear.&quot; The instructions sent by the Turkish Petroleum Company to Baghdad, on which was based the offer which the Iraq Cabinet had under consideration, authorised their local representative to inform the Iraq Government that the Turkish Petroleum Company were prepared, &quot; (a) to make at once a surve)&apos; for a pipe-line and railway to the Mediterranean . . . .&quot;3. The Foreign Secretary, I understand, infers from this that the actual insertion of Haifa in the agreement which was subsequently drawn up between the local representative of the Turkish Petroleum Company and the Iraq Government, must have been the result of the action taken by Sir Henry Dobbs, recorded above. L am unable to accept this view.[19200]B
4. In order to understand the significance of the High Commissioner&apos;s action it is necessary to examine the events leading up to it. On the 6th July, 1928. the High Commissioner telegraphed (Appendix A) reporting that Sir Adam Ritchie the General Manager of the Turkish Petroleum Company, had seen King Feisal and the Iraqi Premier, and as a result was informing his Company by telegraph that such strong public feeling existed in Iraq in regard to the necessity of a Haifa railway that he recommended that a definite assurance should be given by the Company that,, if they constructed a pipe-line to the Mediterranean they would by some means or other simultaneously arrange for the construction of a railway. It is quite clear from Sir Henry Dobbs&apos;s telegram of the 6th July (Appendix A) that Sir Adam Ritchie intended the assurance, which he sought authority to give, to apply to a railway to Haifa. But it was not at that time equally clear that the Turkish Petroleum Company had the same intention. That such was, in fact, their intention was subsequently shown to be the case by the instructions telegraphed to Sir Adam Ritchie on the 12th July authorising him to inform the Iraq Government that the Company would &quot;do their utmost to promote arrangements so that simultaneously with the construction of a pipe-line the construction of a Baghdad-Haifa railway would be commenced.&quot; The Haifa alignment was also definitely specified in the communication which Sir Adam Ritchie made to the Iraq Government upon receipt of these instructions.5. There can be no doubt, therefore, that at that time the Turkish Petroleum Company fully realised that the Iraq Government were determined that the railway should run to Haifa and that they themselves were prepared to promote the construc-tion. of such a railway. The Company\s revised offer, submitted only some three weeks later, was not, however, so precise (Appendix C), in that it referred to a &quot; Survey for railway and pipe-line to Mediterranean.&quot; Sir Henry Dobbs noted this lack of precision, and, observing from their resolution of the 8th August that the Iraqi Cabinet had not seized this point, naturally enough thought it as well to point out to them that they would be well advised to make their stipulation more precise. His sole object was to make sure that they did not forfeit, through any verbal ambiguity, what he knew to be their primary object. There was no &quot;pressure&quot; whatsoever. (A copy of the telegram in which he reported his action will be found in Appendix F.)6. In acting as he did, the High Commissioner was, in fact, giving effect to a suggestion made by myself some weeks earlier. On receipt of Sir H. l)obbs&apos;s telegram of the 6th July, I had anticipated that some such situation might possibly arise, and had telegraphed to him (see Appendix B) pointing out that it was not clear whether the assurance which Sir Adam Ritchie had asked nis Company to give would specify the route to be followed by the proposed railway to the Mediterranean. I suggested that, if there were any doubt, the High Commissioner should advise the Iraq Govern-ment to examine closely any assurance that the Turkish Petroleum Company might give in order to ensure that it definitely committed the Company to the Haifa align-ment, and could not be so interpreted as to leave it open to the Company to discharge their obligation to the Iraq Government by offering to extend the existing Baghdad Railway to link up with the Iraq system.7. A word of general explanation is perhaps needed here. In the first place, I conceive it to be the duty of His Majesty&apos;s Government, as Mandatory for Iraq, to advise the Iraq Government in their dealings with concessionaires, to assist them to get what they want provided their desiderata be reasonable, and generally to safe-guard their legitimate interests. One of my principal duties has been to guard against any ambiguity of phrasing in the legal instruments governing the grant of concessions in Iraq. Where an inexperienced native Government is faced with not over-scrupulous concessionaires, great care in this respect is obviously needed. To take one example, the Iraq Government some years ago were so ill-advised as to grant, without consulting the High Commissioner or His Majesty&apos;s Government, an important concession for land development to a gentleman of indeterminate nationality called Asfar, who promptly unloaded the concession upon certain important financiers in London. The concession was carelessly drawn and its phrasing loose and ambiguous to a degree. The result was that the Iraq Government soon found themselves faced with a formidable claim for damages owing to a factor over which they had no control whatever (unusually low flood levels), and it was only with the utmost difficulty that I succeeded in extricating them from their dilemma.
8. In this matter of the Trans-desert railway I knew that the object which the Iraq Government had in view was a railway having its terminal at a Palestine port. As explained in my memorandum of the 11th March (CP. 73 (29)), their primary-purpose was to remove the menace of a northward expansion by Ibn saud, which would separate Iraq from Trans-Jordan. I knew also that, for economic reasons, the Iraq Government were (and still are) strongly opposed to any connection of their own railway system with the old Baghdad Railway, whose present eastern terminus is Nisibiii, It occurred to me that unless the route for the proposed railway to the Mediterranean were definitely specified, the Turkish Petroleum Company might possibly, having once obtained the extension which they sought, argue that it would be consistent with the terms of their assurance merely to link up the old Baghdad Railway with the Iraq Railway system, and that, by doing so, they would acquit themselves of any obligation on the subject. The Iraq Government might, therefore, find themselves in the position of having granted an extension of time to the Turkish Petroleum Company -without having, in fact, secured the quid pro quo which they intended to obtain, and, moreover, of having definitely alienated the Turkish Petroleum Company&apos;s rivals, the B.O.D., and thus lost the opportunity of securing the construction of a railway to Haifa through the agency of the latter Company. The fact that what the Iraq Government wanted was also wanted by His Majesty&apos;s Government did not influence my action. I should have felt compelled to enter a similar caveat Avhatever had been the nature of the Concession and whether or not Imperial interests had been involved.9. The suggestion that Haifa was specified in the Agreement, which was subsequently drawn up between the two parties, only because of the intervention of Sir H. Dobbs recorded above is, I think, clearly without foundation. There was, I suppose, a remote possibility that this point might have been overlooked (otherwise there would have been no occasion for the action taken by Sir Henry Dobbs), but in so important a document as that concerned with the development of oil over two-thirds of Iraq, in which every word is necessarily most carefully weighed, it is scarcely likely that so ambiguous a phrase as &quot; a railway to the Mediterranean &quot; would have been allowed to stand.10. The position of the Colonial Office, who are frequently called on to adjudicate upon both the interests of the Iraq Government and those of this country, which are sometimes conflicting and difficult to reconcile, is, in any case, a somewhat delicate one. I confess that had not the Iraq Government spontaneously pressed for the Haifa alignment, I should have found myself in a position of some embarrass-ment. Happily, that situation did not arise; and although the fortunate coincidence of interests in this case might give colour to the view that the action of the Iraq Government had been actively inspired by His Majesty&apos;s Government or was thd result of British political influence, that action was the result of no such inspiration and no such influence was brought to bear.11. It has been suggested that the High Commissioner^ letter of the 10th August ought in any case to have been brought to the Cabinets notice, and that my Department was at fault in making no reference to it in the &quot;Historical Note&quot; circulated on the 16th March. I would remind my Colleagues that that note was prepared in response to a request by the Cabinet for more detailed information on, four specific points. The first related to communications between the Iraq, Govern-ment and the Turkish Petroleum Company. This was fully covered in the Note, as were also the second and third points, which raised questions of international law. The fourth point was that quoted at the beginning of this memorandum, viz. : &quot; Whether any pressure had been put by the British Government on the Iraq Govern-ment to insist on Haifa as the terminal port of the railway and pipe-line.&quot; No question arose until a later stage of making any disclosure of evidence to the French Government; and the Note was not prepared with any such object in view. Its primary purpose was to deal with the question whether or not &apos;&apos;&quot; pressure &quot; had been exercised. In order to keep the Note within reasonable compass it was necessary to make selections from a vast mass of documents and to reject anything that was not strictly germane to the question put by the Cabinet, or necessary for the clear exposition of the sequence of events. Sir H. Dobbs&apos;s action was not regarded as. covered by either of these conditions, and consequently no reference to it was thought necessary. The Department were not asked to consider whether any action had. been taken by His Majesty&apos;s government or their&apos; representative which, taken out of its.[19200] b 2
context, might conceivably appear to a Foreign Government as partaking of the nature of &quot;pressure&quot;; they were concerned only with the question whether any such &quot; pressure &quot; had or had not in fact been applied. I fully support their view that, judged by this criterion, Sir H. Dobbs&apos;s letter was not an essential clement in the information required. In any case, I am quite satisfied that no charge either of culpable negligence, or of any intent to withhold relevant information, can reasonably lie against the Department.L. S.

Paraphrase Telegram from the High Commissioner for Iraq to the Secretary of State for the Colonies. Dated July 6, 1928(i\To. 349.)YOUR telegram 22nd June, No. 256. Ritchie has seen King Feisal and Premier, and as result is informing his Company, by telegraph, that such strong public feeling exists here about necessity of Haifa Railway that he recommends that definite assurance should be given by Company that if they construct pipe-line to the Mediterranean they will by some means or other simultaneously arrange for construction of railway. Company, in return for such assurance, would receive five years&apos; extension for which they have asked, and in addition right within the period of five years after conclusion of extension to exchange any out of twenty-four plots which may prove to be of inferior value for any similar number of new&quot;plots. Feisal and Premier would apparently be prepared to accept such an arrangement. Meanwhile, Stanley, as result of interview with Premier, has telegraphed to B.O.D. Company requesting that some definite offer be made to Iraq Government at once.APPENDIX B.Paraphrase Telegram from the Secretary of State for the Colonies to the High Commissioner for Iraq. Sent 3 p.m. July 11, 1928.(No. 275.)JULY 11.Your telegram No. 349 of 6th July. It is not clear from your telegram whether assurance which Ritchie has asked his Company to give would specify route to be followed by proposed railway to Mediterranean.I suggest that, if there is any doubt, you should advise Government of Iraq to examine closely any assurance which Turkish Petroleum Company may give on Ritchie&apos;s recommendation in order to ensure that it definitely commits Company to Haifa alignment, and could not be so interpreted as to leave it open to Company to discharge their obligation to Iraq Government by offering to complete existing Baghdad Railway to link up with Iraq system.APPENDIX C.Paraphrase Telegram from the Secretary of State for the Colonies to the High Commissioner for Iraq.

Ends.APPENDIX D.Extract from- the Proceedings of the Iraq Council of Ministers Meeting, held ohWednesday, August 8, 1928.* * **,*&apos;*.6. The Council of Ministers considered Ministry of Communications and Works letter No. 478, dated the 6th August, 1928, regarding the extension of the period of the Turkish Petroleum Company, and Sir Adam Ritchie&apos;s letter, dated the 2nd August, 1928, containing new proposals from the Board of Directors of his Company. After discussing the subject, the Council of Ministers resolved as follows :  The extension of the  five years should be granted under the following conditions :  (1.) The Company should undertake to increase the drilling operations provided for in the concession by 50 per cent.(2.) The Company should undertake to amend, within a period of one year and a half from the date of this extension, Article 15 of the Concession in a manner which is more advantageous to Iraq and in a way which insures to it the obtention of oil with prices cheaper than those obtained by the interpretation of Article 15.(3.) The Company should undertake not to ask in accordance with Article 39 of the Concession any further extension to the periods stated in Articles 5 and 6 on account of the delay of the operations of the Company arising from the non-delimitation of the frontier between Syria and Iraq and the non-settlement of the dispute between the Company and the Anglo-Persian Oil Company on the western frontier of the transferred territories.(4.) The Company should give a decisive undertaking, to be agreed upon between the Company and the Government within a period of one year and a half from the date of this extension, to construct or insure to construct a railway line, the width of which should not be less than a metre, from Bagdad to a certain port on the Mediterranean at the same time in which the pipe-line is constructed, without any financial responsibility to be imposed upon the Iraq Government. The Iraq Government, however, would have the choice to purchase stocks.(5.) If the Company failed to give undertaking No. (4) regarding the railway line, then the remaining part of the extension, namely the period of three and a half years, should become null and void. Undertakings (2) and (3), however, should remain effective.
APPENDIX E.Letter from Sir Henry Dobbs to His Majesty King Feisal. (D.O. No. R.O. 209.   Confidential.)Y&quot;our Majesty, The Residency, Baghdad, August 10, 1928.I HAVE seen Resolution No. 6 by the Council of Ministers, passed at their meeting of the 8th August, 1928, on the subject of the latest proposal submitted by the Turkish Petroleum Company. I had already informed His Excellency, the Prime Minister, in a letter dated the 3rd August,&quot; 1928, of which I now submit a copy for Your Majesty&apos;s information, that Mr. Amery considered the solution suggested by the Company to be a reasonable one, and I had asked the Prime Minister if he had any doubt on the subject, to give me an opportunity of discussing it with him before he submitted it to the Cabinet. I am surprised that His Excellency ignored my request and gave me no opportunity for discussion.I would now ask Your Majesty to consider whether it would not be wise to move Your Majesty&apos;s Ministers to review this resolution. I have the gravest doubt whether the Company will accept the stipulation that they shall promise now to decrease the price of oil products, although Sir Adam Ritchie&apos;s undertaking to submit the proposal to them for favourable consideration is of course still in force. Nor do I believe that they will accept the reduction from two years to eighteen months of the period within which they are to make up their minds about the construction of the railway. If the Company rejects these proposals of the Iraq Government and does not obtain an extension of the period for choosing their plots, the British Oil Development Company will, of course, withdraw all its offers regarding a railway, since it will be able to tender for plots without incurring any obligation regarding railway construction. The Iraq Government will thus be left with no kind of assurance regarding the construction of a railway.In any event it seems necessary for paragraph 4 of the Resolution of the Council to be amended, so that it shall stipulate that Haifa shall be the terminus of the railway. The Resolution as it stands merely stipulates that the railway shall be &quot;to a certain port on the Mediterranean,&quot; which would permit of its being to a port in Syria. I understand that this is contrary to the- wishes of Your Majesty and of trie Iraq Government, and it is important that the point should be made clear.I am sending a copy of this letter to the Secretary to the Council of Ministers.I remain, &amp;c. (Signed) H. DOBBS.His Majesty King Feisal. Baghdad.APPENDIX F.Paraphrase Telegram from the High Commissioner for Iraq to the Secretary of State for the Colonies. Dated August 10, 1928.IMPORTANT, No. 406.Your telegrams of the 2nd August, Nos. 310 and 311. Ritchie, in letter of the 2nd August, forwarded to Iraq Government final proposals of Turkish Petroleum Company. He left Baghdad on the following day. I informed the Prime Minister by letter on the same day that proposals had your support, and asked him if he had any doubts regarding their acceptance to give me opportunity, before he submitted them to Cabinet, to discuss them personally with himself and any of his colleagues whom he might choose. My request was ignored and Premier laid proposals before the Cabinet on the 8th August without further consultation with me. Cabinet has resolved (1) that period within which Turkish Petroleum Company must arrive at decision in regard to railway shall be reduced from the two years proposed to eighteen months; (2) that Company shall undertake to amend Article 15 of the Original Concession within the said period of eighteen months so as to make oil supplied for consumption in Iraq cheaper than it would be under present Article 15;
(3) that Company shall undertake not to make request for further extension of period under force majeure clause on account of delay arising from non-delimitation of frontier. I have not yet commented on the foregoing resolution to King Feisal, nor has he accepted it. &apos; Bull, the General Manager in Iraq, is informing Turkish Petroleum Company of these proposals by telegraph in anticipation of their acceptance by the King. It seems to me result may well be that Turkish Petroleum Company will lose patience with Iraq Government^ methods, as I confess I have done, and may simply decline negotiation in the end. In that event I would suggest following procedure most likely to bring Government to their senses. First, that Company should present to the Iraq Government immediately claim for indefinite extension of period under clauses No. 5 and No. 6 of Convention on account of non-delimitation of frontier, and state their intention of going to arbitration if this claim is not accepted. Second, that I should be authorised to state that His Majesty&apos;s Government have no intention of negotiating with B.O.D. for construction of railway-through Palestine and Trans-Jordan, and that, therefore, if they reject proposals of Turkish Petroleum Company they will lose all chance of obtaining assurance of construction of railwav. -itI am writing to King Feisal in the meantime stating that I am disappointed at Cabinet resolution and must again urge that due weight be given to opinion of His Majesty&apos;s Government and that Company&apos;s proposals he accepted as being in the best interests of Iraq, also pointing out that resolution of the Cabinet mentions merely a port on the Mediterranean and does not specify Haifa as terminus.The result of my letter will be reported to you, but I would suggest that in the meanwhile you consider how far action which I have proposed is advisable in the event of King Feisal refusing to reject Cabinet resolution and Company refusing to accept it.o
