Printed for the Cabinet.   May 1929.CONFIDENTIAL. Copy No.       28JCP. 13$ (29). cabinet.THE SHANGHAI SITUATION.[Circulated by Direction of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.]THE Secretary of State for War desires me to circulate to the Cabinet the memorandum on the Shanghai situation presented by Mr. Huntley Davidson. The value of the memorandum in the eyes of the Secretary of State lies, I understand, in the passages dealing with the defence of Shanghai, but Mr. Davidson covers a much wider field, and his single constructive proposal is one which I am cjuite unable to support. I feel bound, therefore, whilst complying with Sir Laming&apos;s wish to have the memorandum circulated, to prefix to it a statement of my own views.Mr. Huntley Davidson&apos;s memorandum, apart from certain errors which are. noted below, is on the whole a fair presentation of the difficulties attending foreign municipal administration of the International Settlement. An efficient municipal administration of Shanghai is necessary for that stability and security without which it would be difficult to carry on the foreign trade of China. The Chinese, however, are aiming at gaining complete control of the settlement, and are adopting the method of undermining the present foreign administration. The chief instrument of this undermining process is the provisional court which the National Government uses for political purposes (the other methods mentioned on page 9 are not very convincing). Therefore it is argued that the solution of the Shanghai problem must &quot; pass into foreign initiative,&quot; and the Shanghai Defence Force must not be with-drawn until the solution has been achieved. In the final section headed &quot;Future of Shanghai &quot; (pages 12 and 13) we are told what this solution is, namely, the establishment of a special international area the FYee Port of Shanghai.Unfortunately this solution is quite impracticable. The proposed Free Port would include not only the International Settlement and the French concession, but also the harbour and other areas which have hitherto been completely under Chinese control, and it would be &quot;guaranteed&quot; by an international garrison. It is improbable that the National Government of China would willingly allow themselves to be deprived of their wealthiest city. This solution would therefore have to be imposed by force upon China by a concensus of the Powers. It is not possible to reconcile any such proposal with the assurances in the memorandum that &apos;&apos; No foreign Power, much less Great Britain, entertains any real imperialistic designs upon China &apos;&apos; (page 7); nor does it appear to have occurred to the authors of this memorandum : (1) That such action would be contrary to the Nine Powers Pact of Washington, to which China is a party; (2) that no other Powers would join us in such a policy; and (3) that China would immediately put us in the dock at Geneva.Even apart from this fundamental objection, a Free City of Shanghai is not the attractive proposition which it seems at first sight. The governing body-^an elected council would have to set up their own legislative and judicial machinery. The provisional court is the chief difficulty under the present regime, but any court established by the municipal council might present even greater difficulties. The foreign Powers would not relinquish their extra-territorial rights or their consular courts. The municipal court would, therefore, be a court for Chinese only. We have had experience of such a court in Shanghai during the years 1911 to 1927 when the old Mixed Court came under the control of the consular body and municipal council. Such are the delicacies of international intercourse that the bare statement by any consul that he claimed &quot;interest&quot; in any particular case was sufficient to put an assessor of that consuTs nationality on the bench for the trial of that case. It resulted from this system that illicit traffic in opium and arms and many other nefarious practices flourished under the protection of the Portuguese, Spanish, Italian and other consuls; and it was mainly the existence of these abuses, which4881   [19204] b
struck at the very root of extraterritoriality and all other foreign privileges, in China, that rendered it essential to return the court to Chinese control on the 1st January, 1927. Similar difficulties arising out of the peculiar condition that obtains in China would confront the council in many other departments of their administration, such as harbour control, conservancy, &amp;c.The committee in Shanghai which inspired this memorandum has proceeded on the assumption that it is possible to find some cut and dried solution of the Shanghai problem. If, as appears to be the case, there is no such solution the basis of the whole memorandum is knocked away. Whatever concessions may be made, the Chinese will continue pressing for more until Shanghai passes completely under their control. In such a situation there is no finality. The council and the foreign community must keep their shoulder to the wheel all the time and endeavour by all means in their power, and especially by cultivating good relations with the Chinese authorities,&apos; to make existing institutions work even while they are undergoing a process of change in the direction of admitting a constantly increasing degree of Chinese control? Rather than face this unpleasant alternative it is to be feared that they have deluded themselves with the belief that deus ex machind can provide them with a cut and dried solution. .The paragraph on page 8 headed Constitution of Shanghai Municipal Council &quot; is wrang and misleading. The reference on page 11 to the violation of the Chen-0&apos;Malley Agreement is not borne out by information in the Foreign Office - it is also much too early to judge with certainty whether the existing taxation of trade amounts to intentional violation of Annex 3 of the recent treaty with China. ^  qApril 28. 1929.
MEMORANDUM ON CHINA (FEBRUARY 1929) BY MR. R. HUNTLEY DAVIDSON, A.C.A.Introduction.IT is necessary to emphasise at the commencement that this memorandum is taking for granted the manifestation in China as elsewhere in Asia of indigenous &quot;nationalism,&quot; which should be welcomed and helped in its struggle to survive and grow. This indigenous Nationalist movement is evident throughout the whole of the Far East and constitutes an entirely new factor in the modern situation as compared with the 19th century. China during the past five years has witnessed the rapid development among her people of a Nationalist movement, resulting in the establish-rnent at Nanking of a Nationalist Government composed on the civilian side of many men either educated in America or Europe or with some experience of Western countries. For the first time since the revolution of 1911 we have now a Government in China with a definite constructive programme both as regards internal and foreign affairs, but faced with the colossal task of attempting to exert its authority and carry out its programme in a country of the size and proportions of China. Left with a legacy of anarchy and chaos, disruption and provincial independence, financial bankruptcy and military intimidation, it is evident the task to which the Nationalist Government have set their hands is of enormous magnitude and difficulty.The purpose of this memorandum is a limited and definite one, namely, to summarise the dangers and difficulties which beset both Chinese and foreign commercial interests in China. That no mention is made of other, possibly more hopeful, aspects of the China problem does not imply their denial or that their presence is not acknowledged or welcomed, as they certainly are by responsible British residents in China. Certain fundamental difficulties and unpleasant facts must be faced if genuine Chinese nationalism is to survive, and fear lest it should fail through lack of true discernment of the actualities of the situation at home is one of the chief concerns of British residents here who wish China well.British interests in China ask for no imperialistic policy; they welcome any changes which will lead to closer co-operation and understanding with the Chinese, but ask from their Government such firmness of action and direction of policy as will secure for British residents and traders in China that respect, security and freedom which are their legitimate rights. The entrance of China to a position of equality among the nations of the world must surely carry with it the responsibilities and duties of such equality. To grant the former without insisting upon the execution of the latter constitutes one of the greatest dangers in Sino-British relations. No solution is possible without earnest goodwill and sincerity from China.That the present position of British interests in China calls for adjustment, in the attainment of which sacrifices must be made, is fully acknowledged and sacrifices&apos; will be readily borne if the policy resulting therefrom justifies some confidence in a. solution being definitely reached of the problems which now make such adjustments necessary. Any concessions granted by us to satisfy the demands of present-day Chinese politicians must prove futile if we ignore the fact that the fundamental characteristics of the Chinese race cannot have changed appreciably during the short space of half a century. Therefore a reversion, a mere drifting back, to the state of affairs which gave rise to the so-called &quot;unequal treaties &quot; will indicate no progress in the permanent establishment of better Sino-British relations nor hold out any hope for the future of Sino-British trade and commerce which have always been the main concern of the British Government in formulating its China policy.There is nothing more misleading than to argue Chinese questions from European premises.     What may seem obvious in the West, is likely to be quite preposterous in the East, particularly in China, and it would be easy to draw up a ist of blunders committed by foreign statesmen in their dealings with the Chinese imply because they assumed what was logic in the West would also be logic in China. [19204] n 2
Predictions as to the probable result of certain actions in China have again and a^am proved wrong because such foreign prophets have ignored the most important link in their argument, namely, a correct knowledge of Chinese character and psychology, and this one unknown quantity has upset all calculations.Writing in 1859 Sir Harry Parkes said : &quot; These Chinese questions, instead of reaching a settlement, have only attained a greater growth, and now give promise of greater trouble than ever. Our mild undecided policy has had much to do with this. . . . The Government at home appear ready to do anything almost to get the matter off their hands, but the evil that they have to take in hand is not one that can be dealt with rapidly. It is not sufficient to make engagements with the Chinese; we must also see them executed, and this latter is a slow process.&quot;This memorandum urges that failure to acknowledge and to deal firmly and resolutely with the difficulties now threatening British interests in China is only to court far more serious trouble at a later date, the dangerous consequences of which it is hardly possible to estimate. The mere signing of new treaties with China without firm insistence that they are carried out in both letter and spirit will no more solve our China problems to-day than in the days of Sir Harry Parkes.During the crisis of 1898, when other Powers were united in a policy for the dismemberment of China, Great Britain alone directed the whole of her diplomacy and efforts to preserving the integrity of the Chinese State. During that important period of modern Chinese history British statesmen felt it their imperative duty to safeguard the great commerce which their nationals had developed in China, in the growth of which Chinese, no less than British, interests have been mutually served. Do we ask too much to-day when we ask for our trade and interests to be similarly safeguarded now as thirty years ago ?A correct analysis of the events of the last decade of the 19th century does not indicate any fundamental change in Great Britain&apos;s China policy to be necessary, for the mutual trade and political interests of China and Great Britain are now, as then, identical. Britain has always been pro-Chinese for no other reason than that it serves her own commercial interests to be so. Chinese statesmen, both in the 19th century and to-day, have failed to recognise this basic characteristic of British China diplomacy, hence, as in 1895-98 so again in 1925-28, China turned to Russia for help rather than to Great Britain. Other nations, particularly Russia, have only been too eager to misrepresent Great Britain to the Chinese and the world at large. But that is no reason why we should encourage any acceptance of this misrepresentations-tion of Great Britain&apos;s China policy by adopting an apologetic attitude. The countries who, during the past few years, have most welcomed this misrepresentation of Great Britain are those who, but for England, would have dismembered China thirty years ago for their own selfish political ends. Our sole interests in China are, and always have been, commercial and not imperialistic. But unequal civilisations, the difference between Occidental and Oriental conceptions of morality, ethics and legal justice called for some adjustment by means of treaties and agreements which have given rise to what has so easily been proclaimed as the :  injustice of unequal treaties.&quot; For foreign commerce with China to survive, certain conditions of security and confidence are absolutely essential. To sacrifice these can neither benefit China nor help us to escape the dangers or solve the complex problems which so seriously threaten and encompass the future of Sino-British political and commercial relations.In approaching a study of our China problems it is therefore obviously impossible to divorce them from the historical past out of which they have arisen. Chinese and British commercial institutions have been created in the confidence that security and stability of trade will be maintained. To adjust and revise such conditions of trade and of foreign residence in China, with no insistence that new agreements will be held inviolate, is to undermine the very foundations upon which foreign relations with China rest. To drift across such shifting quicksands of insecurity in the blind hope that Chinese nationalism or British commerce with China will either survive or eventually find stability is to court disaster endangering the future peace and prosperity of the Far East.There is as yet little evidence whatsoever that the time has yet arrived when the Chinese can, or intend to, meet the obligations of a position of international equality which they so insistently claim for themselves and which Great Britain is no less ready to welcome.With these various aspects of Sino-British relations this memorandum largely deals.
General Political Situation in China.There are strong evidences that there is increasing opposition to the Nanking Government, as dissension is still rife between the main military and political factions that exist in China to-day. There are three main lines of demarcation, which again can be sub-divided : 1. Military. 2. Political. 3. Communist.1.   The military spheres of interest are roughly as follows : (a.) Chiang Kai-shek, controlling the Provinces of Kiangsu, Kiangsi, Chekiang and Anhui, also two railways Shanghai-Nanking, Hangchow-Ningpo.(b.) Feng Yu-hsiang, controlling Shantung, Honan, Shensi, Kansu and three railways Tientsin-Pukow,Lunghai,Peking-Hankow.(c.) Kuangsi faction, controlling the Provinces of Kuangtung and Kuangsi, Hupeh and Hunan; Pei Chung-hsi in Northern Chinli and Tientsin.In the north this group controls part of Tientsin-Pukow, Peking-Mukden Railways, and in Central China part of the Peking-Hankow line. Their centres of activity are Hankow and Canton.(d.) Yen Hsi-shan, who controls the Province of Shansi and also the Pekingarea, as well as the Peking-Suiyuan Railway. (e.) Chang Hsueh-liang, who controls Manchuria and Jehol. (/.) Western China the Provinces of Yunnan, Kweichow and Szechuen areeach acting in complete independence, giving nominal allegiance toNanking.On the borderland of these areas control becomes indistinct, and, in fact, within the areas themselves there are more or less constant fluctuations in the balance of power.2. Political Activities. Officially in China to-day there is only one party, namely, the Kuomintang, which, in an attempt to establish itself, with the Nanking Government as its executive, has supplanted the dictatorship by military war lords with dictatorship by the party, which is proving extremely difficult, as the Kuomintang has never really been homogeneous in its theories or practice; for example: (a.) The Western Hills Conference Group (Hu Han-min and others) was drivenfrom the party by Borodin. (5.) Communist members expelled after the break-up at Hankow, (c.) The Kuangsi members in open defiance at Wu-Han.The entire history of the Kuomintang relates a conflict between internal cliques. Thus, the dictatorship is not really of the party, but by some clique, except when all cliques were under the powerful domination of Borodin.Dictatorship by the clique has resulted in the movement for party purification. This terrorism, which justified the killing of thousands suspected of being &quot;Communists&quot; or &quot;reactionaries,&quot; is bringing rapidly its own reaction. The Communist movement has been driven underground; the Chinese press has become merely an echo of the clique in power; capable men are either driven from office or become mere opportunist politicians, fearful lest they involve themselves in &quot;purifiable&quot; complications.The most recent development has been the revival of the old Revolutionary Secret Society of pre-revolution days known as the Tung Men-whei (Elder Brother Society) under the name of the San Ming Tsu I Ta Tung Men (the Three Principles Great Brotherhood), which is attracting to it many disgruntled and discarded political and military leaders.&apos;   The Nanking Government, to exert its authority, recently
made an attempt to suppress or control the activities of the local or district Kuomintang committees, but this was so greatly resented that action has had to be deferred and the third Party Congress postponed from January to March The sectional or district committees of the Kuomintang openly voiced their opposition to Nanking, and now show indications of joining forces with the San Ming Tsu T Ta Mung Men, in an attempt to overthrow the clique now in control of Nanking and the Central Executive Committee. This movement is watched with grave concern by Nanking officials, and it is asserted in many quarters that, unless Nanking can&apos; control this movement, startling developments may occur before or at the comine third Party Congress to be held in March. The Kuomintang dominates the Nationalist Government in a manner similar to the Third International domination of the Government in Moscow. The Kuomintang is torn between conflicting factions  Leftist, Kuangsi-ites, Rightist, Western Hill Conference Confederates&quot; and Communists. All are represented on the Central Executive Committee, in addition to whom we must add General Feng Yu-hsiang, with his North-Western Army Yen Hsi-shan and Chang Hsueh-liang, of Mukden. The general revolt against party-ciique dictatorship is giving the Communist movement in China another opportunity to enter the field openly. The disappointed are retiring from positions of responsibility or being attracted to communism in the hope that they can revive the enthusiasms once stirred by the leadership of Borodin and the propaganda of Eugene Chen.3. The Communist Revival. The revival of the Communist movement is one of the most serious factors in China, especially in view of the situation described above. After the Communists were expelled from the Kuomintang they decided their only hope of success lay in developing their party independently of the Kuomintano&apos; or other political associations. In its revival it is only natural that the Third Inter^ national should take considerable interest, and there are evidences of Moscow direction and attempts once again to control the whole movement. &apos;&apos; Down with the Kuomintang&quot; and &quot; World revolution throughout the East&quot; are their slogans. To further these ends the Chinese Communist party is developing a political organisation with clearly defined party tactics. The new movement is being concentrated up-country among the peasants, whose distressed condition and sufferings after years of civil war make them the most fertile field, as some 60 millions of them live on the verge of starvation. While Nanking and the militarists squander money, nothing is being done to relieve the lot of the long-suffering peasants, who are the only truly oppressed class in China.In many provinces the peasants have already armed themselves in self-defence, against the ravages of soldiery. Local Min-tuan (village militia) form armed villages, to-which must be added such organisations as the Big Sword Society and the Red Spears and the Min Chun People&apos;s army organised in the course of the Northern Expedition. The peasant village autonomy movement is spreading throughout China. This process of disintegration constitutes one of the most important developments; and only the Communist party appear to be making definite efforts to capture and lead the peasants&apos; movement.The weakness of the Chinese Communist party is its inability to prevent sporadic outbursts, such as were seen in Hunan. Canton and Swatow during 1927-28, and more recently near Shanghai. The policy of the Third International is to delay active operations until the whole peasant revolt has been thoroughly organised and the forces co-ordinated. As the present movement is being concentrated on the peasantry, there is probably little likelihood of serious disturbances in large industrial centres until the agrarian revolt is mature. The Communist party cannot afford to run the risk of powerful labour unions in large cities getting out of control, as was the fatal error during 1926-27, which error Borodin did his utmost to avert.The seriousness of this movement in China to-day cannot be minimised as there is no indication that the Nationalist Government or the Kuomintang are attempting to do anything materially to improve the lot of the masses. The real difficulty of the Nanking Government is the Left-Wing movement, a difficulty manifesting itself throughout China, The fact is the country is in a bad way economically and the poor feel the Government has done nothing for them. In other words, the estabhsn-ment of a Nationalist Government has brought nothing approaching the millennium as the people thought it would. The Communists are naturally making the most of this. .        . f  ,.Foreign Policy.-The only point of agreement between all parties and factions is their unanimous demand for the abolition of so-called unequal treaties and tin&apos;
I recovery of China&apos;s sovereign rights.  The existence of the former and the loss of the 1 latter, one and all proclaim to be legacies of their one common enemy &quot;imperialism.&quot; I Were the sole purpose of this aim genuine and sincere, the meeting of it by the Powers I would give grounds for hope of better Sino-foreign relations.   But the situation is by no means so simple.   Any student of the history of the 19th century must be aware that the &quot; unequal treaties &quot; were the definite outcome of the efforts of foreign nations to secure recognition of their equality of status by the Chinese and such conditions for&quot;&quot; trading and living in China as would mitigate the friction and impossible conditions experienced in the days of the East India Company.   Two-. civilisations. East and West, fundamentally different in many respects directly opposed in every important characteristic, made it necessary to regulate their intercourse upon a system of treaties which made up for the lack of a common ground upon which to meet.  Whether the adoption by China of certain Western conceptions of civilisation yet justifies the extensive abrogation of these treaty conditions is still open to question.  But it is significant to note the Chinese to-day do not really demand equality, but inequality in their favour, a reversion to the pre-treaty state of affairs.  Furthermore, it must be now obvious to all concerned that mere treaty revision cannot solve the difficulties by which China is still encompassed.   If and when all the &quot; unequal treaties &quot; have been revised the fundamental problems, above indicated, will still remain.  It will then be no longer possible for Chinese politicians and propagandists to continue deceiving their long-suffering people by assuring them that all their ills are due to &quot; foreign imperialism &quot; and the &apos;&apos; unequal treaties.&quot; But this mere awakening to the realities of the situation would, in itself, hardly justify the sacrifices now being made to meet the demands of Chinese nationalism.The Third International. Russian attempts to injure British trade and discredit Great Britain in the Far East are nothing new to the student of Sino-foreign diplomacy during the years 1894-1900. Russian desire to dominate Chinese political affairs is as evident to-day as during the last decade of the 19th century.The activities of the Third International in China are of no mere local significance to Great Britain, for the British Empire is receiving their concentrated attack along the whole of our Far Eastern &quot; frontier,&quot; from Afghanistan to China. If the British Empire can be undermined and British statesmanship discredited in the Far East, the main bulwark against -world revolution will have given way. The Russians have learnt that a war of propaganda is both more effective and cheaper than a war of bullets. The Chinese, to their own cost, are fast learning the power of propaganda. Propaganda has carried them a long way during the past three years, but threatens the life of any Chinese Government which is thus attacked. Russian propaganda methods helped the Kuomintang from 1924 to 1927, but threatens the latter&apos;s own existence to-day.Finance. In a statement issued recently, Mr. T. V. Soong, the Minister of Finance, shows that Nanking also must face the menace of national bankruptcy.. Providing the disarmament proposals recently adopted at Nanking are carried out  which is as yet very problematical T. V. Soong estimates a deficit of 50 million dollars a year, limiting military expenditure to 192 million dollars. But in fact the military expenditure for 1929 can hardly be less than 280 millions, which will involve a deficit of 140 millions. The Minister of Finance further complains that only four provinces furnish any figures or remit any revenue to the Central Exchequer, namely, Kiangsu, Chekiang, Anhui and Kiangsi. It is no wonder he claims that unless the country can be unified &quot;the future is dark indeed.&quot;These are in general outline as far as it is possible to gauge them the main political features of the present China situation in the light of which we.now proceed to consider the problem of Shanghai.Shanghai.So far as foreign interests-and British particularly-are concerned, Shanghai is the central factor. If Shanghai should be lost it would spell ruination to British trade as well as Chinese foreign commerce itself. Chinese&apos;&quot; anti-imperialism&quot; to-day is in reality fundamentally a revival &apos; of the anti-foreignism of 1842-65 skilfully fostered and encouraged by the Third International for its own aims; &apos; clothed in their language and armed with their slogans. No foreign Power, much ess Great Britain, entertains any real imperialistic designs upon China. The&apos; only power actively interfering in China is the Third International. &quot;&apos; &apos; &quot;:
Until recently, foreign administered areas have kept free of the disruptive influences so manifest in China of recent years, hence in large measure their commercial prosperity and security. But now these areas are threatened and if once permeated must result in the ruination of China&apos;s foreign trade and commerce. China is one of the great potential markets for British products and all that such trade means for British employment and labour. To retain any influence for stability and moderation in China, Britain cannot afford to lose her position in Shanghai, the greatest commercial and shipping port in China (fifth in the world), for China&apos;s sake as much as for her own. Hence the urgency of a positive and practical programme to save the situation from drifting past redemption in our day and generation. For Great Britain to fail in China must mean loss of her leadership in the Far East and in time may threaten the existence of our Eastern Empire which is the fond dream of the Third International.It has been pointed out that there is unity among all Chinese parties on the question of abrogation of treaties and the retrocession of settlements and foreign concessions. The methods adopted for securing these ends have been demonstrated clearly at Hankow and elsewhere. There still remains for solution the problem of Shanghai, to which the Nationalists are giving more and more attention. Economic, political and judicial forces, aided by constant propaganda in China and abroad, are being brought into action and skilfully marshalled against us. Communism is not the immediate danger as already indicated. Pressure from the Chinese is incessant and, unless the solution of the Shanghai problem can pass into foreign initiative, we must prepare to accept the entire Chinese programme without regard to the Chinese and foreign commercial interests jeopardised thereby. Should the Shanghai defence force be withdrawn or reduced beyond safe limits, we shall witness the present incessant undermining of the authority and status of the International Settlement immediately intensified. Such a situation must inevitably involve grave risks of incidents arising at least as serious as those which preceded the loss of the British concession in Hankow.Constitution of Shanghai Municipal Council. The foreign settlement of Shanghai derives its authority and status from the Land Regulations of 1854. The limits of the settlement were extended by agreement with the Chinese authorities in 1898; It is important to note that the settlement does not depend exclusively upon treaty provisions, but rests upon a tripartite agreement between :  1. The Chinese Government. 2. The Treaty Powers. 3. The Ratepayers.Any constitutional change in its status or regulations must have the sanction or approval of all three parties involved. The Land Regulations do not provide for Chinese representation upon the municipal council, for the foreign settlement was originally set apart for residence of foreigners only. However, to meet modern circumstances, Chinese representation was finally introduced in 1928, though in 1860 and again in 1898, when it was proposed by the foreign councillors and Powers, the Chinese showed no interest in the proposal whatsoever. Chinese representation on the council was adopted in 1926, but owing to Chinese political reasons was not accepted by them until last year.At present the Shanghai Municipal Council consists of the following councillors appointed annually : 5 British. 2 American. 2 Japanese. 3 Chinese.Six Chinese have also been added to the Advisory Committees.While on the question of Chinese representation on the Shanghai Municipal Council, it must be noted that there is no popular representation on any Chinese Municipal or Provincial Assembly, not even for the Municipality of Greater Shanghai (Chinese area), though the Chinese are insistent upon no taxation without representation in foreign or Sino-foreign controlled areas, which now are the only areas in China enjoying representation for Chinese civilian interests.Taxation. It is true Chinese residents contribute 55 per cent, of the revenue collected in the.Shanghai foreign settlement, but on a per capita basis each foreigner pays about 145 taels annually as compared with 6-6 taels paid by each Chinese.
Furthermore, it must be pointed out that 84-2 per cent, of capital expenditure is contributed by foreign investors in municipal debentures, while only 15 - 8 per cent, are held by Chinese.Much Chinese-owned land in the settlement is held by them under &quot; fangtan &quot; deeds, which, not being registered, are not subject to municipal land tax/ This results in Chinese not contributing their full proportion of municipal revenue, thouglVif unregistered land is surrendered to the council in connexion, with public improvements, owners are fully compensated on the usual basis. In this connexion it is interesting to note the Nanking Government pay no compensation whatsoever to owners of land and buildings taken over in Nanking by the Chinese authorities in connexion with the construction of the great boulevard now being made there, costing, it is said, 5 million taels, over which the remains of Dr. Sun Yat-sen are to be conveyed on the occasion of his ceremonial burial in the new mausoleum at Tiger Hill on the 12th March next.Finance. The latest municipal balance sheet shows debentures issued and outstanding as amounting to 50 million taels; total assets to just under 100 million taels. The budget for 1928 provided for an ordinary expenditure of over 12 million taels.New Problems facing Settlement. It has been pointed out that the Nationalist programme insists upon the immediate retrocession of all foreign-controlled areas, but it is significant that up to the present no demands are being made for the modification of foreign control in areas held by the Trench, though the demand for the return of areas in which British interests predominate or have been under British control grows more and more insistent.In Shanghai the problem presents itself in an unique manner. Its solution by negotiation on terms safeguarding mutual Chinese and foreign civilian rights and interests is already being prejudiced hy subversive propaganda and interference with the existing administration. The manner in which these activities manifest themselves may be summarised as follows : 1. Despite the quiet of 1928 and the relegation of Communist activity to a secondary position, nevertheless such activity continues &quot; underground &quot; waiting for any incident which may serve as a pretext for creating trouble on a large scale.2. Should the fall of the Nanking Government materialise at any time, the result would bring about chaos not only in China, but a repetition of previous dangers locally.3. All classes of Chinese, except possibly the mercantile community, are united upon a policy of gaining control of the municipal administration of Shanghai irrespective of the greater issues involved in the abrogation of existing treaties. To further this end a consistent policy of undermining the foreign control and administration of the settlement is in active operation : (a.) The Shanghai Provisional Court, the only court of appeal for the execution of Chinese legal jurisdiction in the foreign settlement (for both the Municipal Council and the public), acts in the dual capacity of a public judicial tribunal and a political instrument of the Nationalist Government and the Kuomintang. This is seriously interfering with the work of the municipal police in maintaining law and order.(&amp;.) The Social Bureau for Labour established outside the settlement, together with the sectional committees of the Kuomintang&apos; for this area, are persistently interfering with, when not instigating, labour disputes within the settlement area for purely political purposes. The attitude of these organisations is both domineering and provocative towards foreigners as well as towards Chinese and foreign employers of labour. Nanking&apos;s ineffective control over the activities of the Social Bureau and the sectional committees is very evident. , ,(c.) Pood-stuffs entering the settlement are being illegally taxed and. the removal of-refuse from &quot;the settlement is being interfered with.(a!.). The Public Health Bureau of Greater Shanghai (Chinese territory)while seeking co-operation with the Municipal Health Department, resents, the insistence of foreign standards of health - &quot; i administration as a conditio sine, qua non to reciprocity. While taking exception to municipal inspection outside the settlement, the Chinese[19204] c
Health Bureau is continually interfering with the work of the Municipal Health Department inside the settlement.(e.) Attempts are already being made to assume jurisdiction and control over municipal roads outside the settlement before the question can be settled by negotiation.(/.) The settlement is being hemmed in by a military road adjacent to the western boundary, which road will cut right across all municipal roads leading out from the settlement, and places the municipal sewage works beyond settlement protection should serious trouble arise.(g.) In view of the political atmosphere existing in China generally, free and frank discussion, in council meetings, of many matters relating to the conflicting political interests of Chinese and foreign communities is often impossible. To attempt to avoid individual politico-military dictatorship, the Kuomintang, as already explained, have adopted the committee or Soviet system of government. This frequently results in resolutions being passed without anyone having the power to make such resolutions effective. Each member of the committee is a spy on the others for the party each.represents. Individual and party jealousies have been intensified. As with all committee work, unless there is individual executive power and authority, resolutions and decisions never get further than the paper they are written upon. Chinese control of the Shanghai Municipal Council under these conditions would raise very serious and far-reaching dangers. These difficulties are gradually manifesting themselves in the Shanghai Municipal Council through its Chinese councillors and committee members very able and excellent men but themselves powerless against the intimidation resulting from the disruptive party strife so manifest in Chinese political life to-day, of which they are the accredited representatives.These constitute some of the major dangers with which Shanghai is faced at the present time.The Defence of Shanghai,In view of the dangers and magnitude of the problems set forth above, the importance of retaining an adequate Shanghai Defence Force is of the utmost urgency. Its departure prior to a settlement of outstanding issues would expose Shanghai to very grave risks and involve not only the withdrawal of effective military defence, but what is even more important, the withdrawal, in Chinese minds, of the moral support of the Powers, which is so essential if adjustments are to be made by constitutional and evolutionary processes.I.   Difficulties of increasing the Shanghai Volunteer Corps: (a.) In 1926, only by dint of personal appeals to commercial organisations and utmost sacrifices was the Shanghai Volunteer Corps increased to 2,000. This number included, a considerable percentage of special constables, professional and single-handed commercial men who had to abandon their occupations, while staffs of the large firms were reduced to thinnest skeletons.(b.) Refusals by consuls of countries not enjoying extra-territorial rights topermit their nationals to join the Shanghai Volunteer Corps for fear of chinese retaliation, (c.) Inability of indigent Russian refugees to volunteer except in paid units. (d.) Refusal of certain American firms to allow their staffs to join, based uponthe doubtful assumption that the foreign Powers could be relied upon todefend Shanghai.(e.) Refusal of the Japanese to volunteer in larger numbers owing to Japanbeing able to land regular forces here within forty-eight hours.   Owing . to conscription in Japan, volunteer service is not in vogue. (/.) The comparatively small population contribute practically the wholetechnical and indispensable staff to large public utility bodies, essentialland and shipping services. (g.) Whilst practically all nationalities contribute, the result of the above means that the greater part of the burden falls upon the British community,though, of course, British interests predominate.
(h.) For long periods the greater part of the staff of British organisations have-done continuous military duty to the detriment of their business and to the advantage of their competitors of other nationalities. This has been most discouraging to British merchants.(i.) Any additional service would necessitate increasing staffs quite unsoundly from viewpoint of business policy.2. A&quot;partial palliative would be to augment the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Force, which is semi-military, by increasing the present White Russian contingent.(a.) At best this expedient would be of doubtful permanent value.(b.) The Chinese pay more than half the rates and are opposed in principle toan armed defence force upon political and patriotic grounds. (c.) Special precautions are necessary to avoid including Russians inocculatedwith Bolshevik doctrines.3. Shanghai is criticised for relying too much for defence upon foreign Powers and too little on its own resources.   It must, however, be pointed out that: (a.) Out of an ordinary income of 12 million taels, 3^ million (29 per cent.)is devoted to defence in the upkeep of police and volunteer forces, towhich must be added the cost of any increase in the White Russian units. (b.) The foreign adult male population, according to the census of 1925, is approximately 10,000.   Of this number 3,600 (36 per cent.) are serving in the Shanghai Volunteer Corps or police units, (c.) A considerable proportion of the remainder of the personnel is engaged inindispensable services mercantile and public utilities while there areothers engaged in one-man business concerns. (d.) It is doubtful if any municipality anywhere else is so heavily taxed forpurety defence or where so large a percentage of its adult male population is serving in its defence.For the Shanghai British community, responsible for investments considerably exceeding  100 million, and all that this trade means for employment of British labour in England, to live under the constant danger of having to resort to arms in self defence is certainly not conducive to a sense of. security. The issues and problems thus presented, involving as they do serious international complications, are a responsibility which should be shared by home Governments both as regards their defence and solution.China&apos;s Treaty Obligations.Recent developments in Hankow revealing the violation of the Chen-0&apos;Malley Agreement by the Chinese Government and the disregard, already manifest, by the imposition of taxes contrary to Annex III of the new Sino-British Commercial Treaty indicate the serious problem of enforcing any new treaties or agreements made with China. It would appear very evident that treaties made to-day with any Chinese authority, just as Sir Harry Parkes found during the years 1842-65, are-valueless unless the Chinese are made to realise that such treaties can and will be enforced after they have been accepted by the parties thereto. Agreements made between Chinese themselves are only kept when the parties thereto are in a position to enforce them. It took British statesmen many years last century before they realised what Russia knew all the time, that to the Chinese political agreements are not made with the prime object of being kept, but only as a move for position in an endless game of bluff. Any student of Chinese politics to-day can see this is true of all Chinese internal political strife. It is only natural that the same conception should be held by them regarding Sino-foreign political relations.Presented with the difficulties and issues which have been set forth in this memorandum, the urgency of some solution to the Shanghai problem becomes apparent. The situation if left to drift in its present direction must lead sooner or later to a crisis of first-class magnitude. The question therefore arises as to what effective measures are practicable to avert such a crisis?   .[19204] d
In the first place there seems nothing to be gained from making any further concessions to China or any new agreements if the Chinese on their part refuse to abide by the terms of the new treaties which have already been made during the past two years. It is therefore urged that the time has now come when Great Britain should indicate in no uncertain language that she is not prepared to consider any further negotiations pending the carrying out, in letter and in spirit, by the Chinese of the new treaties already granted in Hankow and Nanking.The purpose of general treaty revision and adjustment of the existing status&quot; of concessions or settlements is to remove causes for friction existing between China and Great Britain and place Sino-British relations upon a more friendly and stable basis. The treaties already signed demonstrate Great Britain&apos;s readiness to meet Chinese national aspirations. But if revised treaties are to be binding for one party thereto only, and disregarded by the other, the resulting consequences entirely defeat the main purpose in view. Instead of placing Sino-British relations upon a more permanent and friendly footing, these relations will revert to those existing prior to the enforcement upon China of the so-called &quot; unequal treaties.&quot;A stand will have to be made sooner or later, if catastrophe is to be avoided. We must be fair and just to the Chinese, but unless we are firm also, a policy of conciliation must fail. This application of justice tempered with firmness in dealing with China constitutes the great task of modern statesmanship. The difficulties of this task are perhaps hardly realised by those who do not know China intimately, and who are apt to judge things and minds Chinese from standards of Western civilisation.&apos; Chinese&apos; constructive leaders find it impossible to withstand the power of disruptive intimidation so powerful in China to-day, and their task is made more hopeless because the foreign Powers also appear helpless when confronted by these disruptive forces. Rather than acknowledge or face the difficulties this situation reveals, it would appear we yield when we should remain firm, drift when the situation demands positive action, thus involving us in an eleventh-nour evacuation because we have permitted developments to pass beyond our control. To recover, therefore, the initiative in dealing with China, and particularly with the Shanghai problem, before it is too late, is of utmost urgency.Future of Shanghai.The present unsatisfactory state of animated suspension is likely to continue indefinitely.The Chinese will press for a change in status of the settlement and work to this end through attempting to secure larger representation on the council.In view of Hankow experiments as well as the general political situation in China, it is evident the Chinese will endeavour to present the Powers with a fait accompli in Shanghai as at Hankow.Insistence upon the status quo being maintained is unlikely to receive sympathetic consideration in London and Washington. Any further accommodation of Chinese present demands will only create a worse situation, as these demands cannot be satisfied except by immediate total surrender, which would spell ruination to Shanghai. The difficulty of persuading Home Governments to retain all international garrison here indefinitely under the existing constitution of the settlement, makes some further adjustment of the present position necessary.The prosperity of Shanghai is dependent upon the maintenance of three institutions in a state of efficiency and security : 1. A Municipal Council.2. A River Conservancy Board.3. The Maritime Customs.If any of these institutions should pass into corrupt or inexperienced Chinese control, and be subject to Chinese political intrigue or intimidation the stability and credit of Shanghai would, be seriously jeopardised.It should also be pointed out that though this memorandum deals with the problems of the international Settlement, any solution of the Shanghai problem must recognise the mutual interests and interdependence of the International Settlement and the French Concession adjacent thereto. The issues at stake in Shanghai are those of foreign interests as a whole.   As already pointed out the
ressure from Chinese in favour of changes in the status of Shanghai is practically ntirely concentrated upon the International Settlement where British interests redominate and British responsibilities are greatest.1. It is suggested that an alternative is to propose positive action in requesting the establishment here of a Special International Area The Free Port of Shanghai.(a.) With  equitable   Chinese   representation  on  the   GoverningCouncil;(&amp;.) Guaranteed by International Garrison, pending such time as the Chinese Government have demonstrated their intention and ability to fulfil treaty obligations, and provide the security and confidence which have hitherto been given in foreign administered areas.2. Unless some positive constructive action is proposed by foreign interests, the initiative remains with the Chinese, who have proved themselves past masters in securing their aims by means which it is most difficult or impossible to resist through diplomatic channels.3. It is further suggested that the temporary removal of the whole Shanghai area from Chinese political contention would :  (a.) Assist in stabilising the general China situation and strengthen the hands of the moderate constructive elements.(b.) Make the question of future concessions to Chinese legitimate national aspirations dependent upon China effectively assuming the obligations of international equality, and would be a most effective way of bringing pressure to bear upon the Chinese to fulfil treaty obligations.4. It is further submitted that this proposal is in accordance with the defined policy of Great Britain and America towards China, inasmuch as it merel3^ postpones the carrying out of their declared programme pending evidence of Chinese good faith and ability to assume the responsibilities of the position she demands. Meanwhile, the Shanghai area would thus be removed from the maelstrom of Chinese political strife and would be an excellent training ground for Chinese to obtain municipal administra-tive experience with foreign co-operation by utilising the present municipal organisation or such modification thereof as experience may justify. When the defined programme of further concessions to China could be proceeded with would then entirely depend upon Chinese demonstrating their ability to assume their responsibilities and giving evidence of their good faith.5. The alternative to some such proposal as the above seems to place the Shanghai Municipal Council in the false position of unreasonably main-taining a &quot; die-hard &quot; position which, as time passes, must inevitably embitter existing relations between Chinese and foreign interests in Shanghai, which can only lead sooner or later to a crisis jeopardising the whole credit and prosperity of this port. The responsibility for dealing with such a situation without adequate support from the Powers is manifestly unfair to Shanghai. A continued resistance by the Shanghai Municipal Council alone to further Chinese demands must have most serious and dangerous consequences. There is as yet no evidence whatsoever that Chinese insistence upon the immediate abolition of concessions and settlements will moderate. In fact, there is every indication of this insistence becoming greatly intensified in the near future.Note.
