THIS IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY!S ;GOVERNMENT.Secret.c.p.  137 (29)Copy No,28CABINET. SAFEGUARDING OF INDUSTRIES. REPORT. OF THE WOOLLEN AND WORSTED COMMTTEB. Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.ara.96It will be recollected that a committee of enquiry appointed under the safeguarding of industries procodure reported in 1926 that a case was not at that time established for Imposing a duty on imported woollen and worsted tissues, although the situation required careful watching.     As the result of a renewed application from the industry and after consulting tho Cabinet,  I appointed a cammitteo at the end of last year to consider the case in the light of the present position,  and I now circulate to my colleagues their roport.The death of the chairman of the previous committeo rondorod it impossible to refer the second application to the samo persons,  and I remitted it accordingly to the three gentlomon who constitute the committeo of enquiry under the Merchandise Marks Act, Sir       Llewellyn Smith, G.C.B., Mr. G.N.Barnes and Mr. F.R. Davenport.    TheiP terms of referonoe wero &quot;to inquire into tho application for the imposition of a duty on all dyed or undyed imported tissues or fabrics manufactured from warp and weft in a weaving loom (whether in the piece or in any other form) and made wholly or partly from wool or hair of any woight from 2 ozs. per square yard up to and including 11 ozs. por square yard but excluding folt,  rags and tailors&apos; clippings&quot;.The Committee find that the applicants havo established a claim to a duty so far as ooncorns those tissues and fabrics between the weight limits of 2 ozs.  and 11 ozs. por square
ra.99.ra.109ra.102.-ra.107.ra.108.-r*a. 110.yard which fall within the category of women&apos;s dress goods.They state that if the above finding be accepted it will probably be necossary for administrative purposes to apply the duty to all classes of woollen and 7/orsted tissues within the weight limits.     The great bulk of the imports of these tissues are women&apos;s dress goods.Tissues containing only a snail proportion, say up to 10 por oent. by weight, of wool or hair should be exempt from duty .The Committee do not definitely specify the rate of duty but suggest that the rate required to countervail the unfair competition lies between 10% and 15% ad valorem, and draw attention to the figure of 12?t% arrived at by the previous Committee.A specific duty is recommended on garments containing woollen or worsted fabrics on a scale sufficient to cover tho material in them.    The suggested range is from 6d. an article on garments the import value of which is 10/- and under up to a maximum of 3/6d. in the case of garments valued at  4 and over.   Por administrative reasons any such duty would have to be levied whether the fabric was between 2 and 11 02s. to the square yard or outside those limits, but the Committee are satisfied that the imports of garments made with fabric outside the weight limits is relatively small.They consider that all other classes of manufactured goods containing woollen and worsted tissues should be specifically exempted from duty as no case for &quot;safeguarding&quot; was made out in respect of any of these goods, and in some oases the collection of a duty would be oxtremely troublesome for the Customs and would involve great interference with trade.So drawback is recommended&apos; beyond the usual drawback on artioles re-exported in the same form in whloh they were imported..

Tho applicant industry is of substantial importance.s.22 &amp; 27,      In applying the test of &quot;abnormality&quot; of imports,the Committee find that it is impossible to compare pre-war and post-war figures, as comparable data are not available. They tako as their standard of comparison the trend of production and imports between 1924 and 1928.    They eliminate the earlier post-war years as they consider that Gorman and French competition had not developed its normal post-war capacity.a.25. If the test of abnormality has to bo answered by takingtho aggregate of all classes of woollen and worsted tissuesand comparing the total production of all classes with totalImports of all classes,- importation is not abnormal.s.29 to But when consideration is limited to lighter tissues37.(the application related to tissues from 2 to 11 ozs-) the ratio of imports to production and home consumption is much more serious *    The Committee consider it legitimate and reasonable to concentrate attention on &quot;women&apos;s dress goods&quot; and they find that in this olass of goods importation is abnormal.a.47. They find that Women&apos;s Dross Goods are being sold oroffered for sale in the United Kingdom at prices which are below the prices at which similar goods can under existing conditions be profitably manufactured&apos; or produced in the United Kingdom.    It will be seen from Paragraph 40 that the applicants submitted 32 samples,  and that roughly 30$ would on an average have to bo added to the price of tho foreign articles to equal the British prices, as.49-50. It was abundantly proved by Ministry of Labour figures and Trade Union evidence that employment in this industry is suffering from serious - depression.    Not only is the percentage of unemployment high, but no loss than 17*,000 persons
.72..68.havo left the industry since 1925.    There is also considerable under-employmont, which usually takes the form of a woaver minding one loom instead of two. ,55. &quot; Tho Committee found that tho principal cause of thedeprossion was the falling off in consumption, but that tho increased imports of recent years have contributed to make this depression more acutely folt, especially as the outlets for British goods in overseas markets have been simultaneously curtailed both by tho world decline in demand and by the growth of wool textile industries in various overseas countries under the shelter of import tariffs.The applicants proved their claim that thoir foreign competitors derive an advantage through the inferiority of conditions of employment of labour-    The average level of hourly earnings in the wool textile industry in France is from one-third to one-half less than the level in this country. .69.       As regards Germany the available data indicate a probable over-all average of between 70% - Q0%- of the British average hourly earnings..81. They consider that judged by the standard of what iscommercially practicable under present conditions, the appli-cant industry is carried on with, reasonable efficiency and economy..94. Provided that any duty be effectively applied to tissuesembodied in imported made-up garments they state that there is no likelihood of tho duty exercising any seriously adverse effect on employment in the garment-making trades. No -34. evidence was called by the opponents of injury likely to be caused to any other using industry, and it is reasonable to -infer that other industries do not consider their interests to be seriously menaced-

SAFEGUARDING     OF      INDUSTRIESB.e-port of the woollen AND WORSTED COMMITTEE.
The Right.Hon. Sir Philip Gunliff^e-Lister, K.B.E.,M.C, M.P., President of the Board ef Trade.1. We were appointed on the 22nd December, 1928, to be a Committee to enquire into the application for the imposition of a duty onALL DYED OR UNDYED IMPORTED TISSUES OR   FABRICSMANUFACTURED FROM WARP AND   WEFT IN A WEAVING LOOM (WHETHER    IN THE PIECE OR IN ANY OTHER   FORM)  AND MADE WHOLLY   OR PARTLY FROM WOOL OR HAIR, QF ANY WEIGHT FROM TWO OUNCES PER SQUARE YARD   UP TO AND INCLUDING ELEVEN OUNCES PER SQUARE YARD, BUT EXCLUDING FELTS, RAGS AND TAILORS1  CLIPPINGS.2? We began our Enquiry on the 4th February, 1929.    We held twenty-four meetings,  and heard the evidenoe of 37 witnesses, 22 on behalf of the applicants^ and 15 on behalf of the opponents.     The greater part of the evidence was given in public, but it was found necessary to hear certain confidential evidence in camera.3. We have been furnished with valuable statistical data by the Statistical Departments of the Board of Trade and the Ministry of Labour and we have had the advantage of a conference with the Customs Authorities.   - We desire to express our thanks to all these Departments for their assistance.4. The applicants were the Bradford $nd District Manufacturers&apos; Federation, the Ksighley and District Manufacturers&apos; Federation,  and the Textile Commission Manufacturers&apos; Association, They were represented by   Mr, Oyril Atkinson, K.0.,M.Pa,  and Mr. N.L. Macaekie,  instructed by Mr. J^H. ^ockwood.The opponents were a group of manufacturers.and merchants, and they were represented by Mr. A.S.0omyns Garr, K.C;,  and Mr. C.F.Entwistle, instructed by Messrs. Stikeman and Company.5. The applicants are primarily concerned with the manufacture of worsted tissues, but the evidence showed that the following Associations of woollen manufacturers supported the application and had briefed the same Counsel -
(a) Huddorefield Woollen Safeguarding Association.  (This is an ad hoc Association of Manufacturers&apos;in the KudderefieTa district who are in favour of the application) i(h) Heavy V.roollen District Manuf acturers&apos;  Association;(c) Leeds and District Woollen and Worsted 1-ianufacturers1Association;(d) &apos;i&apos;eadon and Guiseley Manufacturers&apos; Association;(e) Calder Vale and District Woollen and WorstedManufacturers&apos;  and Spinners&apos; Association.The applicants    stated that they had also the support of the British Wool Federation,  the Worsted Spinners&apos; Federation, and the Bradford Dyers&apos; Association (Wool Branches).We are satisfied that the application ha3 the support of the bulk of the manufacturers engaged in the production of the goods included in the reference.6- It   was also chov/n in evidence that the application was supported by the National Association of Unions in the Textile Trade.    It appeared however from the evidence that there was a very considerable difference of opinion on the subject among the executive oomriittees of the various Unions represented on the National Association.7. The application was supported in evidence by    the Wholesale Mantle and Costume Manuf act tubers? Federation, but it appeared from a   resolution of the Executive Council of this Association that the support given was conditional on the    tariff treatment to be accorded    to apparel containing dutiable woollen or worsted tissues,    This matter is referred to below,  see para.88.8. The applicants informed us that they did not desire their application to cover cloth imported as a component of furniture,  toys    and tennis balls,   and they suggested that the reference.should be amended accordingly.9.    We do not propose to attempt to make a general summary of the arguments and evidence submitted tc us on behalf of the
applicants and opponents, but to deal with the chief points which appear to us to be relevant under the various headings set out in the White Paper.    There is, however,  one matter to which we think it desirable to refer at the outset.10. A difference of view manifested itself between the applicants and the opponents as to the exact intent and effect of question 8 of the White Paper.      The applicants appeared to hold that the scope of the Enquiry was strictly confined to the specific questions set out in the White Paper,  and that if all these questions were answered in a sense favourable to the applicants,  the recommendation of a duty must follow automatically.    On the other hand,  the opponents urged that while an    -affirmative answer to each of the specific questions was an essential condition without which no duty could be recommended, the language of question 8 implied that the Committee had a discretion,  even if all these conditions were fulfilled,  to refuse to recommend a duty on grounds other than those expressly referred to in the White Paper,  since these do not cover,  and could not have been intended to cover,  all the considerations which have necessarily to be taken into account In arriving at a decision.11. As the questions here raised are of crucial importance, we think it right to say at the outset that we take a view of our duties which is somewhat different from that expressed by either of the parties.Vi/e agree with the applicants that the only questions which we are expected by   the White Paper to decide are the specific questions enumerated therein,  and while we are not proJiibited from referring in general terms to other considerations we are of opinion that our conclueion must be based upon the general tenor of the answers to these questions.    We do not agree with the opponents that we are entitled to take extraneous considerations into account in arriving at our finding, for this would imply that we are entitled to take decisions on matters
which are not before us.    Nevertheless it is.impossible for us to ignore the fact that the questions referred to ua only cover part of the ground.    In the case of a great industry such as that to which the present application relates, there are aspects of the problem which may be of considerable if not of decisive importance, but which lie outside our reference.12.    The woollen and worsted industry is, and for many years has been, one of our great exporting trades, and in such circumstances the effect of any duty both on the exporting power of the industry as a whole, and on Its means of access to foreign markets, must be matters of grave importance. Though we were unable within our terms of reference to consider this aspect of the question in detail, it was evident that some of the witnesses who appeared before us are anxious as to the possibility of the branches of the woollen and worsted trade In which they are interested suffering reprisals in foreign markets.    Again the White Paper includes no question as to the effect likely to be produced on the interests of the ultimate consumer by a duty on Imports, though it is manifest that this also is a matter of importance in the case of an industry the products of which are among the most essential materials for the clothing of the people..13.    We fully recognise that questions of this order are reserved for the consideration of the authorities responsible for the final decision, and in any case the machinery of the present Enquiry is not such as could be readily adapted for their elucidation.   We only refer to them as Illustrations of the view which we hold that the scope of our Enquiry la necessarily restricted, and that therefore any finding at which we arrive cannot by itself be decisive either in favour of or against the imposition of a duty. -14.    We consider that the only reasonable construction to put upon the language of the question &quot;Whether, having regard to
the above conditions, the applicant industry has; in theopinion of the committee proposed, established a claim to a duty&quot; Istnat we  -are desired to report whether or not the claim ef the applicants has been established in so far as this depends onthe answers to the questions set out in the White Paper.We now proceed to consider these questions seriatim.(1) Whether the applicant industry is, by reason of the volume of employment engaged in the production of the good3 to which the application relates, or by reason of the nature of the goods produced, an industry of substantial importance.15.   We have no hesitation in answering this question in the affirmative.    It was agreed by the opponents that the Industry te which, the application relates is of substantial importance.16.    The Census d Production of 1924 showed that of the total amount ef woollen and worsted tissues manufactured In this country (I.e., 443 million square yards) over 245 million weighed under twelve ounces to the square yard;    and after making due allowance for tissues between eleven and twelve ounces and for those under two ounces, it is clear that more than half the total production calculated in yardage must fall within the weight limits specified in the application.    The exact number of workpeople to whom the production of these tissues afforded employment cannot be stated, but according to the evidence it cannot have been less than 100,000 persons.17.   Between 1924 and 1928 there has been some shrinkage both in the numbers employed and in the volume of production, but this decline is insufficient to affect the broad conclusion that the industry is of substantial importance by reason of the volume of employment and of production.18.    The applicant industry is also, in our opinion, of substantial importance by reason of the nature of the goods produced, since these goods form&apos;an essential part of the materials with which the population of Great Britain are clothed,
9 o o (Cooand also make a considerable contribution to the exports ofBritish products, whereby the country is enabled to secure theimport of foodstuffs and materials of industry which arenecessary to sustain the national life.19.    WE, THEREFORE, REPORT THAT THE APPLICANT INDUSTRY IS rpSUBSTANTIAL IMPORTANCE, BOTH BY REASON OF THE VOLUME OFEMPLOYMENT, AND OF THE NATURE OF THE GOODS PRODUCED.(2) Whether foreign goods of the class or description to which the application relates are being imported Into and retained for &quot;cons imp b ion in the United Kingdom in abnormal quantitfes.2o.    In considering whether foreign goods of the kinds covered by the application are being imported into and retained for consumption in the United Kingdom &quot;in abnormal quantities&quot;, we are faced with the difficulty not only of interpreting the true meaning of this expression, but also of finding a practicable test or standard of comparison which Is capable of being applied, in view of the want of comparability of the statistical, data available.21.    Various tests of abnormality were proposed by the parties, including the ratio of retained imports to British output, exports, and home consumption, as compared either with pre-war conditions, or with the conditions that prevailed in the early years following the war.    Some of these tests are impracticable through absence of comparable data;    others are defective through tbe want of normality in the period with which comparison is made.    The applicants also urged that the volume of unemployment wa3 itself a test of abnormality, and that if a comparison with pre-war imports be admissible it should be limited to the classes of goods which are really competitive.   The opponents, on the other hand, urged that the only valid test of abnormality was an over-all comparison with pre-war years.&quot;8$-.    We expressed the view at the Enquiry that there is no mechanical test of abnormality which is universally applicable,
and that all the -circumstances must be taken into account with a view to seeing whether, in the aggregate, they point to an abnormal situation.   We consider, however, that a comparison between the present and the pre-war situation, if it were feasible, would furnish the most satisfactory standard, and that the ratio of retained imports, either to home consumption or to total production,, would on the whole afford the best test of &quot;abnormalityw.     Unfortunately there are great practical difficulties in applying either standard or test.23.    The available official figures give no direct means of measuring the importation of woollen and worsted tissues within the weight limits named in the application, since the present statistics only show the quantities under twelve ounces (instead of eleven ounces) to the square yard.   Moreover, the statistics of imports and production before the war made no distinction of //eights, and the linear yardage then shown needs for comparative purposes to be transformed into square yards by the application of a conversion factor which involves an element of doubt.    In these circumstances, it is obvious that any comparisons with pre-war years must involve a considerable conjectural element.24. Beginning -with the most general comparison (i.e., ignoring weights altogether) we have the following figures for production, exports, retained imports and consumption of woollen and worsted tissues of all descriptions in certain pre-war and post-war years, which, with the exception of the year 1928, are selected as being the years for which statistics of 3ritish production are available.    In this table linear yards   have been converted into square yards by the addition of 35 per cent in the case of worsteds, and 53^&apos;S  per cent in the case of voollens, a formula which tfe understood has been generally used by the Board of Trade, and by the Balfour Committee.

The figures do not include Danaslcs, tapestry, and other furniture stuffs; wool and mohair plushes; and flannels and delaines, except for a small quantity of the last-named in the Retained Imports for 1912.&quot;[&quot;Estimated by the method described in paragraph 25 below.25.    Any estimate of the total production of woollen and worsted tissues in Great Britain in 1928 can only be very rough as no official production statistics exist for that year.    On the whole, after careful consideration, we are disposed to think that the change in the aggregate wages paid in the industry which according to the Board of Trade Journal of the 24th January, 1929 (see page 122) declined by 7.3 per cent between 1924 and 1928, is the best measure available of the general trend of production in the industry as a whole.    On this basis, the estimated production in 1928 was in the neighbourhood of 410 million square yards, giving a total home consumption of 279.7 million square yards,  to which the retained imports- p -
contributed between 13 and 14 per cent.    Even allowing for a wide margin of error in thia estimate it is abundantly clear that the trend of the figures showing the aggregate yardage of retained imports of all classes of woollen and worsted tissues and the proportion of the home market supplied by such imports gives no indication of any abnormal growth.    On the contrary it is evident that the requirements of British consumers for woollen and worsted tissues,  taken as a whole, are now being met in a higher proportion by British manufacturers than was the case before the war.    The figures showing the ratio of retained imports to production show the same general trend.26.    Ve have endeavoured to make a similar comparison limited to the categories of goods covered by the present application, but the necessary data are wanting.    In the first place, as already stated,  there are no official figures relating directly to goods under eleven ounces in weight, and the best that can be done is to substitute the v/eight limit of twelve ounces - which probably makes only a slight difference in the calculation.    A- much more serious difficulty is chat the pre-war statistics do not classify imports, production, or exports by definite weight categories, and all our attempts to draw comparisons by conjectural adjustment and regrouping of the pre-war figures have failed to yield results on which we think it safe to base    any inferences.27. vYe are,  therefore, reluctantly compelled to abandon any effort to compare production, imports, or consumption of the goods falling within the weight limits specified in the application with the corresponding figures for pre-war years, and the best that we can do is to trace the changes which have taken place within the post-war period.    Even here we are met with great difficulties.    There are no official figures for post-war production, except for a single year, 1924, and we have been compelled, in order to obtain some sort of estimate of
production in 1928,  to make the assumption that practically the whole of the decline in total production shown in the previous table as between 1924 and 1928 was in the lighter classes of goods.    Though this assumption introduces a certain doubtful element into the estimate we think that,  in view of the evidence,  it Is not ah unreasonable one to make.28.    On the above assumptions we have the following comparison between 1924 and 1928.    We do not consider that it Is proper to take post-war years before 1924 into account, partly because the means of estimating production for those years are lacking, partly because the years 1920 to 1923 were themselves highly abnormal, owing inter alia to the temporary cessation of effective competition from Prance and Germany arising from the war.WOOLLEN AND WORSTED TISSUES DESCRIBED IN THE OFFICIAL STATISTICS AS BEING UNDER TWELVE OUNCES IN WEIGHT &apos; PER SQUARE YARD.(Millions of square yards).	.    1924.	1928.Production- in Great	245.2	212.5f	165.5	135.8	79.7	76.7t	20.2 i	33.3	99. 9	110.OtRatio of retained imports to -	20.2 8.2	30. 3t 15. 7ttEstimated by the method described in paragraph 27 above,.
T-ll-29. We hesitate to base any positive conclusion on this table, in view of the shortness of the period over which the comparison extends, and the conjectural nature of some of the essential figures.    All that can safely be said is that so far as they go the figures corroborate the evidence of the previous table as to the general trend in the last four years, and at the same time confirm the view, which we have also derived from the evidence, that the rate of Increase of retained imports and the   I ratio, of retained imports to consumption and production have both risen more sharply in the case of the lighter tissues than    I of tissues as a whole.30. So far the evidence as to abnormality is inconclusive.-We do not think, however,  that the expression&quot;foreign goods of the class or description to which the application relates&quot; necessarily restricts us to the consideration of the aggregate of these goods,   and we are of opinion that we are not precluded from considering separately any important category included therein.    By this is meant some broad general class or description of goods.    We do not of course mean that we should be justified in answering the question in the affirmative solelyIbecause there may have been &quot;abnormal1&apos; imports of goods of some particular appellation., e.g., repps or serges or face-cloths or any other of the multitude of designations applied in the trade to different varieties of fabrics used for the same purpose.    It is obvious that the continual changes of fashion lead to constant though minor changes in the character of the goods  chiefly in demand, which nevertheless in spite of altered nomenclature serve substantially the same object, and for the purpose of the present --inquiry must be regarded as goods of the same class or description.31. The Applicants invited us in effect to say that the classes of foreign goods which are being retained in this country in abnormal quantities are those which are directly
competitive with the products of manufacturers of the Bradford district.    For this purpose, the applicants presented an analysis of pre-war Imports classified so as to distinguish the categories of goods.    According to this analysis only 12-g-million square yards of the 70 million square yards of pre-war retained imports of woollen and worsted tissues were in the opinion of the Applicants competitive with Bradford manufactures.A good deal of difference of opinion arose between witnesses for and against the application as to the precise categories of goods which were,  in fact, included in the pre-war imports, and still more as to the extent to which they were then &quot;competitive&quot; with Bradford products.    It is, however, unnecessary to enter into the latter question,  since it is clear to us that the expression &quot;goods of a given class or description&quot;, cannot properly be used to signify goods which are competitive with the products of a particular area.    For this reason we reject the suggestion implied in the applicants   arguments and evidence that we should confine our attention to the goods which at any given time are competitive with the products of the Bradford area.33. We are disposed, however,  to think that it would be legitimate and reasonable to concentrate attention on the category of  &quot;women&apos;s dress goods&quot;, which In our judgment con-stitutes a class or description of goods to which the test of abnormality may be properly applied.    Though this is a category which does not figure separately In the official trade statistics, it appears from the evidence to be well recognised In the trade, though no doubt,  as in so many other cases, there is an indefinite border line.    We understand that according to trade usage the term includes all manner of woven fabrics and tissues ordinarily used for women1s dresses,   costumes,  or coats, but excludes those used for underclothing and of course all kinds of .goods primarily destine:&apos;1 for men&apos;3 wear or for purposes other than apparel.
34.    It is the category of womeris   dress goods to which the evidence and arguments of the applicants were almost exclusively directed, and we formed the Impression that other classes of goods were only included within the application because of the difficulty of devising a formula which would exclude them.    In fact no serious attempt was made by the applicants to make out a case on merits for imposing a duty on any classes of fabrics other than women&apos;s dress goods.     No doubt the difficulty of definition is a real and serious one, which we shall touch on when dealing with question 8, but this difficulty does not arise on the question to which we are at present addressing ourselves.35.   As stated above there are no separate statistics of the imports of women&apos;s dress goods, but a table submitted by the applicants affords the means of making a rough estimate of these imports just before the war.      If from the estimated aggregate of seventy million square yards of retained imports of all classes we deduct materials which were presumably above the weight lim.it, or were used for underwear or other purposes than women&apos;s dress goods in the strict sense of the term, we arrive at a total of between 30 and 40 million square yards, or say round about 35 millions.     At the present time the retained imports of these goods probably amount to about the same total calculated by yardage, but the volume of home consumption has fallen so greatly in the meantime, that the percentage of the home demand for women&apos;s dress goods supplied from abroad has undoubtedly risen very considerably compared with the pre-war period.     We are satisfied on the evidence that the consumption in the United Kingdom of women&apos;s dress goods of the materials falling within the application has seriously declined, owing partly to the competition of goods of other materials (e.g., artificial silk) and of knitted goods,  and partly to the decreased yardage necessary to make a dress, viz., from about 7 to 3 linear yards, a decline which, according to
the evidence, has by no means been balanced hy the Increased number of garments purchased.      Of this contracted demand for women&apos;s dress goods an increasing share has been met in recent years by imported fabrics, which at present appear to predominate in the home market as regards this particular class of goods. Though, therefore, it is impossible, owing to the classification of the trade returns and the absence of recent figures of production,  to give an exact figure as to the relative shares of the home market in women&apos;s dress goods supplied by British and foreign manufacturers, we cannot doubt from the evidence put before us that the retained imports can fairly be described as &quot;abnormal&quot; in comparison with any previous experience.36.    This conclusion is confirmed by an examination of the course of trade since 1924.     According to the evidence, practically the whole of the increase of retained imports of tissues below twelve ounces to the square yard as between 1924 and 1928 (viz., 13 million square yards or over 60 per cent.) was accounted for by women1s dress goods.37.    Our answer,  therefore, to question 2 is that it has not been proved to our satisfaction thet the aggregate quantity of retained imports of foreign goods of all classes and descriptions to which the application relates is abnormal, but WE ARE SATISFIED THAT FOREIGN GOODS OF THE GLASS OR DESCRIPTION KNOWN IN THE TRADE AS WOMEN TS DRESS GOODS, BEING GOODS OF A KIND TO ^HICH THE APPLICATION RELATES, ARE BEING IMPORTED INTO AND RETAINED FOR CONSUMPTION IN THE UNITED KINGDOM IN ABNORMAL QUANTITIES.(3) Whether the foreign goods so imported are being sold or offered&apos; for sale in the United Kingdom at prices which are belof? the prices at which similar goods &quot;can be profitably manufactured or produced in the United Kingdom.38.    In dealing with this question,  a difficulty arises asto the meaning to be attached to the term &quot;similar&quot;.     There aregoods, of which in the course of the Enquiry many samples were
produced, which at least to the inexpert purchaser, are indistinguishable in appearance, and (so long as they last) serve precisely the same purpose.      Nevertheless they may differ in some quality such as durability, which affects the price at which they can be profitably produced.      As we understand the matter, such fabrics though practically identical to the eye of the purchaser would (rightly in our opinion) be regarded in the trade as dissimilar, while, on the other hand, goods which differ in colour and appearance may be regarded as similar, If they are identical in essential quality and construction.     When we add that, according to the evidence, the current practice in Yorkshire and abroad differs appreciably in regard to the use of long and short wool, single and double warp yarns, and ether technical matters affecting the quality as distinct from the appearance of the goods, it will be evident that any comparison between the dress goods produced respectively in this country and abroad, which are in actual competition with each other, cannot, strictly speaking, be regarded as a comparison of like with like.      For there is no question of the superior durability of the British product though according to the evidence this information is not always passed on to the ultimate purchaser.39.    It was suggested in evidence that the averagetpurchaser cares little for durability as compared with appearance and cheapness, and no doubt the present inclination in favour of frequent change puts a certain premium on cheapness as compared with quality.      Still we are- by no means convinced that there is not a market for durable goods, If salesmen understood and explained clearly to their customers the difference of quality and construction of goods which may under-lie their superficial resemblance.     We return to this matter when dealing with question 6.
&apos; 40.    It was doubtless in order to eliminate the difficulty and ambiguity referred to above that the applicants did not . rely wholly&quot;or mainly on any aomparison between competitive goods actually in the market, but endeavoured to present a straight com-parlson between the prices of identical articles.     For this purpose they submitted 32 samples of imported fabrics of which 13 were French, II German,  4 Italian, 3 Dutch and 1 Belgian,  together with particulars of the prices at which they were being, or had recently been sold or offered for sale In the United Kingdom, and the estimated price at which similar goods could be profitably made by British manufacturers.      If these estimates were correct, roughly 30 per cent would on an average have to be added to the price of the foreign articles to equal the British prices.     The applicants claimed that the goods represented by the samples covered the great bulk of the imported competitive fabrics to which the application relates.     The samples included 11 repps^ 7 suitings, 5 face-cloths, 2 serges,2 crepes,  and 5 ticnuos of other descriptions.41.    The opponents contended that these samples were not fairly representative of the whole range of goods which would be affected by the proposed duty, and it is clear that they were more representative of imported Women&apos;s dress goods than of all classes of woollen and worsted materials falling within the weight limits specified in the application.      It is further probable that worsteds were somewhat over-represented among the samples c6mpared with woollens, and It is quite likely,  as urged by the. opposition, that some of the samples, which had been purchased several months before the Enquiry, represented goods which have since gone out of fashion.      None of these criticisms, however, seems to us to be of substantial importance,  and we accept the results put before us as sufficiently establishing the proposition that in existing circumstances, British manufacturers are not, or at least believe
themselves not to bo, in a position to meet the competition of all or most of the foreign goods represented by the samples. How far this belief is justified depends on the costings on which tjie comparison of selling prices was founded.12.      It will be seen from what precedes that the comparison submitted was between actual sale transactions in respect of imported goods, and. estimated costings made of the same goods by selected British manufacturers with the customary allowance for profit.      It was common ground that the system on which these costings was carried out ?/as the usual system followed in the trade when tendering against a sample.      It is, however, clear from the evidence that this system, as carried out in practice does not always yield very precise results, and that in some cases the margin of error may be appreciable.43.      In a few cases evidence was produced by the opponents as to the actual costing or mode of manufacture of certain imported fabrics included, among the applicants&apos;  samples,  and the results showed considerable differences as compared with the estimates made by 3ritish manufacturers on the basis of the samples.     These differences related to such matters as the weight of the finished fabric, the quantity, nature and quality of the materials necessary for its production,  and the nature of the finishing processes employed.     As the evidence on costings was given in camera    it is not possible in this Report to give detailed examples, but it may be said generally that the discrepancies were in some cases sufficient to have a&apos; material influence on the total price at which the goods could be profitably manufactured.44A    The applicants did not admit the accuracy of some of the foreign costings, and in those cases in which they were not supported by the oral evidence of the actual foreign manufacturer, the possibility of effectively examining them in detail was somewhat limited.      iVhile, however, we are fully satisfied that
the British manufacturers who analysed the samples framed their estimates to the best of their ability according to the system usual in the trade, we are of opinion that they had not always appreciated or allowed for various methods of economy, which, as shown by the evidence, were actually practised by the foreign manufacturer, especially as regards the economic use of material. It also appeared that different manufacturers might genuinely form different opinions as to the composition and cost of production of substantially similar fabrics as the result of analysing small samples.     The evidence showed that, especially in the cheaper classes of fabrics, the weight of samples taken from different &quot;pieces&quot;, or even from different parts of the same &quot;piece&quot;, is liable to vary within somewhat wide limits. An example was afforded by the widely divergent analyses and costings of two samples of cloth, which were subsequently proved in evidence to be interchangeable products supplied by the same foreign manufacturer at the same price.45.    Relying on divergencies such as these, and also   on other criticisms  (e.g., the alleged excessive allowance for wastage and charges for dyeing and finishing in the British costings) the opponents urged that the real differences between the British and foreign prices were not as a rule greater than could be bridged by the exercise of greater skill and care on the part of the applicant-industry.      They, therefore,  contended that the present differences of price afforded no ground for concluding that it Is Impossible to produce similar goods at competitive prices in the United Kingdom.46.    &apos;,7e consider, however, that the question of the efficiency of the industry and of the possibility of increasing that efficiency so as to reduce the costs of production, falls to be considered under question 6 rather than under the present heading.      We take the view that we are bound to answer the
present question on the basis of the present structure, organisation and degree of efficiency of the British industry, iioreover, for the purpose of this question, it is not necessary for the applicants to establish the precise amount of the average difference between the British and foreign prices of the goods under consideration.    It suffices that there should be a substantial difference, and as to this we do not think that on the evidence it is possible to entertain any reasonable doubt. In this connection we were impressed by the evidence given to us in camera by merchants accustomed to purchasing both British and foreign goods, as to the growing proportions of their purchases of women1s dress goods from foreign sources in recent years, a change which they ascribed mainly to differences of price,470    Having in view the above considerations, we do not feel that the criticisms of the opponents materially affect our broad conclusion that foreign goods of the types represented by many of the samples submitted to us by the applicants, i.e., &quot;women1s dress goods&quot;, are being sold or offered for sale in the United Kingdom at prices which are below the prices at which similar goods can, under existing conditions, be profitably manufactured or produced in the United Kingdom.48.    WE, THEREFORE,    ANSWER QUESTION 3 IN THE AFFIRMATIVE-, SO FAR AS IT RELATES TO WOMSN&apos;S DRESS GOODS.(4) Whether, by reason of the severity and extent of suchcompetition, employment in the manufacture or production of such goods in the United Kingdom is being, or is likely to be, seriously affected.49.    It was abundantly proved in evidence that employment inthe wool textile industry is  suffering from serious depression.This is evident from tho official statistics of the Ministry ofLabour which show a continuous shrinkage in the number ofinsured parsons following the trade which, after makingallowances for the change of age limit, cannot be less than
17,000 or approximately 6.4 per cent as between 1923 and 1928.50.    Apart from this &quot;attrition&quot;&apos; which is a sure sign of decreased demand for the products of the industry, the proportion of persons following the trade who are recorded as -unemployed has during the last five years averaged 11.7 per cent, while during the years of acutest depression in 1925 and 192S the proportion of unemployed averaged 14.7 and 16 respectively.    During 19 28, the percentage averaged 11,7 rising from 8.4 in the first half of the year to 15 in the last half. Moreover these statistics take no account of a form of under-employment which is not unusual in the wool textile industry in times of depression, viz., the sharing of work so as to avoid discharge,  so that(for example) a weaver who ordinarily minds two looms may in such times only mind one.51.     The evidence of the above statistics was corroborated by the figures given in evidence on behalf of the Bradford and District Power Loom Overlookers&apos; Society, which showed that in the Bradford district the number of such -overlookers employed had diminished from 1,250 in 1920 to 1,087 in 1928, and that this diminution had been accompanied by a decrease in the average number of looms supervised by each overlooker.    Other figures were supplied to us by the General Secretary of the National Onion of Textile Workers which showed that the per-centage of members of this Trade Onion signing their &quot;vacant book&quot; in the Bradford, Shipley and Keighley districts;(which cover- the bulk of the women1 3 dress goods trade)  averaged 6,0 and 19.4 respectively for the first and second halves of 1928,52,    Other methods of estimating the decline in employment were suggested by the applicants, including the statistics of idle looms, and an ingenious method of tracing the course of employment in the Bradford area by means of a &quot;chain&quot; index number, based on statistics returned to the Ministry of Labour by a number of worsted manufacturing firms.    Both the last
mentioned methods indicated a greater percentage decline than the official statistics of unemployment and of the number of Insured persons supplied to us by the Ilinistx^y of Labour, hut all thelse methods are subject to various criticisms and qualifications, if used to measure the volume of unemployment as distinct from indicating the general trend.We do not think it necessary, however, to enter minutely into the question of the best method of measuring unemployment, or of its precise volume, since we are satisfied, both by the statistics and by the evidence, that employment in the industry as a whole is being seriously affected by the depression in the trade, and that this decline in employment has been more marked in the women&apos;s dress goods section than in the other branches of the industry.53.   This was not indeed contested by the opponents, and the only question at issue is how far this depression is to be ascribed to the competition of imported goods.    In answering the previous questions we have stated clearly our opinion that the taproot of the troubles in this industry is the falling off in the consumption of its products, a decline clue to causes unconnected with the competition of imported goods.    This decline of demand hss.been common to the whole Western World, and its effects on Industrial activity have only been partially offset by the increased demand for wool textiles on the part of those Eastern countries which are adopting Western modes of dress.54,    So far as concerns the woollen and worsted industry of Great Britain, the effect of this decline in consumption was partly masked during the years immediately following the war by the almost complete cessation of imports from abroad, which in 1920 amounted only to 2 million, and in 1921 to 3 million square yards of the goods falling within our reference.   This cessation was In itself &quot;abnormal&quot;, owing to the temporary prostration of Germany and the devastation of the woollen
textile districts of Prance, but while it lasted the British industry did not feel the full force of the depression due to the fall in consumption.   When, therefore, the imports from France and Germany began to revive, their competition was the more severely felt in Great Britain, inasmuch as the home market which they Invaded was much more limited than before the war.    It may be noted that the retained imports of the -;oods falling within the reference rose to 30 million square yards in 1927 and 33 million square yards in 1928.55.   We, therefore, find that the principal cause of the depression in employment in the applicant industry is the falling off in consumption, but that the increased imports of recent years have contributed to make this depression more acutely felt, especially as the outlets for British wool textile goods in overseas markets have been simultaneously curtailed, both by the worDd decline in demand and by the growth of wool textile industries in various overseas countries under the shelter of import tariffs.56.    IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES AND SUBJECT TO THE QUALIFICATIONS INDICATED IN THE PREVIOUS PARAGRAPH WE ANSWER QUESTION 4 IN THE AFFIRMATIVE.(5) Whether such exceptional competition comes largely from countries where the conditions are so different from those in this country as to render the competition unf a ir.Competition for the purpose of such enquiry is not to be deemed to be unfair unless it arises from one or more of tbe following causes;-(a) Depreciation of currency operating so as to&apos; create an export &quot;Bounty, (b ) Subs1dies\ bounties, or&apos;other artificial advantages.(c) Inferior conditions of employment of labour,&quot;whether as respects remuneration or hours of employment, or otherwise, obtaining amongst the persons employed in the production of the &quot;imported goods in question as compared witE those obtaining&apos; amongst persona employed In the production of similar goods in the United Kingdom.
57.    The applicants claimed that the foreign competition of which they complain is &quot;unfair&quot; under each of the headings (a),  (D) and (c).    They laid, however, much the greatest stress on (c), via,., inferior conditions of employment of labour.5S\    As regards (a) , we are not disposed to attach serious importance to the contention of the applicants that an export bounty is caused by depreciation of the currency in any of the countries from which the bulk of the imports are derived.    In all these countries the currency is now upon a gold basis, which makes impossible the continued depreciation and fluctuation of the exchanges which, at the time of the previous enquiry,  were shown to operate as an export bounty by creating and perpetuating a difference between the internal and external values of the currency.59.    Some of the applicants   witnesses suggested that the low rate at which the French currency was stabilised in 1928 created an export bounty, but this claim was not very seriously pressed end it seems to us to be inadmissible.    It may be that stabilisation in France has not yet been long enough in force to have entirely put an end to the former difference between the internal and external value of the franc, but any difference that may yet persist can only be a comparatively small and disappearing remnant of the differential advantage previously derived by French manufacturers from the continuing deprecia-tion of the  franc.   The same is true of Belgium and Italy, both of which countries have stabilised their currencies since -the date of the previous enquiry.    Germany had already put its currency on a gold basis before that enquiry.    The precise rate at which the currency of each country has been stabilised as comp?.red with its pre-war value has in our judgment no effect except a purely transitional one in creating or maintaining an export bounty, the continuance of which depends essentially   on continuing depreciation and instability.60,   Under heading (b) the applicants claimed that the
collapse of the German&apos; currency in 1913 had. the effect of wiping out mortgages and other financial obligations,   end thus operated as a &quot;subsidy, bounty or other artificial advantage&quot; in &apos; favour of German manufacture.    Similarly they claimed that the financial assistance given by the French Government to the &quot;devastated areas&quot; had been used to re-equip and modernise the woollen end worsted industry in those areas, and had thus greatly increased the competitive power of that industry.    It is to be noted that both these advantages were in existence at the time of the previous enquiry in 1925, and it seems to us that they must have since diminished, and that they must be offset to a material and increasing extent by the higher rates which German and French manufacturers have since had to pay for new capital to extend or improve their equipment.    No attempt was made by the applicants to substantiate their claim under this heading by positive evidence, and we consider that the claim is inadmissible.61.   There remains for consideration paragraph (c) to which the applicants attached chief importance and which was the only branch of the present question on which they submitted specific evidence, viz., the possible advantage that may be derived by foreign competitors through inferior conditions of employment cf labour.62.    On this subject a great volume of evidence was submitted to us by the applicants on the subject of rates of wages or earnings prevailing for various occupations in the wool textile industries in France, Germany and certain other countries.    We are convinced that this mass of information was compiled by the applicants with every desire to present a fair statement of the position.    Statistics, however, of the con-ditions of employment in different countries are always difficult to obtain and interpret on a really comparative basis in the absence of minute knowledge of the precise nature of the
occupations compared; the distribution of the various classes of workpeople, skilled and unskilled, male and female, adult and juvenf].6, in such occupations, and in the varicus areas in which the industry is carried en; the true significance of the rates cf wages qux-ted  (e0g0, whether representing minimum time or piece rates cr actual earnings), and the varicus qualifications tc be introduced in respect of allowances cf all kinds.63.    It is perhaps net tc be wondered at that the material presented has proved on detailed examination to be of very unequal value, and in many cases the basis cf the figures was by no means certain, e.g., It was net always possible tc be certain whether the rates quoted were the averages of actual earnings, cr minimum rates which might be considerably exceeded in actual practice.    Moreover, certain comparisons submitted by the applicants seemed to us open tc considerable criticism, as for example the comparison cf the wages cf men weavers in Germany, where a majority cf the weavers are men, with those cf men weavers in the Bradford district where weaving by men is almost non-existent,    The result of such a comparison is, in cur opinion, tc give an incrrrect- impression of the relative labour cost of weaving as actually practised in the two countries,64.    In the course of the proceedings, the wages statistics submitted by the  applicants were supplemented by the results cf the official German enquiry into wages In the textile Industries In 1927, which were communicated tc us by the Ministry cf Labour, together with such information as is in their possession with regsjrd to changes since the date of that enquiry.65.    The opponents did not submit comprehensive figures with regard to foreign wages, but they strongly criticised some of the statistics submitted by the applicants, and urgeo that the only satisfactory evidence of foreign wages costs must be
that derived from actual costings of woollen and worsted fabrics.66.   We are sc far in agreement with this contention of the opponents that we consider that the only way in which &quot;inferior conditions rf   the employment cf labour&quot; could give rise to &quot;unfair competition&apos;&apos;&apos; is by unduly depressing the viagss cost per unit of product of  the foreign go rds which come into competition with British manufacturers.    Satisfactory evidence, however, of relative labour costs in different countries per unit of product is extremely difficult to obtain, and in view of the language of the White Paper, we did not think It reasonable to expect the applicants to do mere than to prove that in countries from which the exceptional   competition largely comes, the conditions cf  employment of labour In the production of  the imported goods in question are substantially inferior to those prevailing in this country in the production of similar gocds.     This in our opinion was sufficient to establish a presumption that labour costs are lower in the countries in question, which it was for the opponents to displace.67.    We have been at great pains with expert assistance to examine and summarise the mass of  evidence with regard to wages placed before us by the applicants, taking into account not only the criticisms of the opponents, but also the various qualifications, adjustments and amendments which seemed to us necessary to enable sound comparisons to be made.    It is unnecessary for the purposes of this Report to state in detail all the difficulties which presented themselves owing to defects in the data, or to dwell upon the means which we adopted to surmount those difficulties, including, where necessary, reference to any sources of  information to which we had access,68. It suffices to nay that as a result we have satisfied ourselves that the level of average hourly earnings in the wool textile Industry in France is not less than a half and not mere
than two-thirds cf the c err re- spo riding level in this country.   The level cf hourly-earnings for weavers  (men and women combined) is net  less than 6C  per cent cf that prevailing in Yorkshire, and probably somewhat higher.69.    As regards Germany; the available data Indicate a probable over-all average r f between 70 tc 80 per cent of the British average hourly earnings.    This result was obtained by two different methods which, though neither of them was free from qualification, corroborated each ether fairly closely. As in the case cf Prance, the average hourly earnings cf German weavers are far nearer the British level than the average &amp;j  all occupations in the industry, being prcbabiy as much as 90 per cent of the average earnings in Yorkshire.    The general &quot;over-all&quot; average of German weel textile earnings is, however, lowered materially by the inclusion cf  classes other than weavers, whose earnings are probably only from 6C to 80 per cent of those prevailing in this country.    It is tc be observed that women and especially women weavers were not represented in the German wages enquiry cf 1927 in their full numerical proportion, the result being to raise somewhat the ever-all average as shewn by that enquiry.*   T7e have made allowance for this so far as possible by re-weighting the figures on the basis of the German Census.70,    It appears, therefore, that the average hourly earnings in the French wool textile industry are very considerably below the corresponding British level, the average deficiency-being between one-third and one-half.     While German average hourly earnings are. also below the British level, the discrepancy is much less marked, prcbabiy lying between 20 and 30 per cent.    The contribution of other countries to our imports of the classes of goods included within the application appears to us not  tc be sufficiently large to warrant a similar analysis of the conditicns of rerauneration o f labour in these countries. German OfficiaT^Snquiry was maas i-ntejr alia vrith the object cf   com-ing rates of wages&quot;with average earnings, and for this purpose it sufficient tc select certain important occupations and districts..-27-
71.    In judging, therefore, whether or not &quot;the conditions are so different from those in this country as to render the competition unfair&quot;   (within the meaning of &quot;unfair&quot; set out in question 5) we have to consider primarily the case of Prance. Here the deficiency of average hourly earnings compared with Great Britain appears to be so great that, unless this inferiority were shown to be balanced by an equal inferiority in the average efficiency of labour, the conclusion is unavoidable that the condition specified i n question 5  (c) has been established.    No specific evidence was submitted on the subject of the comparative efficiency of labour, but whatever allowance it may be thought reasonable to make under this heading when we come to deal with question 8, we find it quite impossible to believe that any difference of efficiency between the labour of the two countries could be sufficient to counterbalance the great inferiority in earnings.72.    Vve therefore consider that the inferiority in hourly earnings must operate to some extent to lower the labour cost of producing French wool textile fabrics.   Admittedly the great bulk of the French exports of such fabrics to Great Britain come within the present application, and therefore must In our opinion enjoy a competitive advantage through the inferiority of conditions of employment of labour.    ACCORDINGLY VvE ANSWER QUESTION 5 IN THE AFFIRMATIVE.(6) Whether the a pp.1 leant industry is being carried on in the united TCihgd om. with rli a &quot;sellable 6f.fi b&quot;i e contingency&quot; and e c on economy.73.    The applicants claimed that their industry (by which,generally speaking, they appeared to mean the industry concernedwith the production of women&apos;s dress goods) is as efficient asthat of any of their competitors;    that they are capable ofmaking and have in fact made, on a commercial scale, fabrics ofevery kind similar to those which are being imported, and at least
equal in quality to those fabrics;    and that the only factor which prevents them from competing successfully with the foreign imports Is the difference of productive costs and hence of price, arising in their view mainly from causes beyond their control.74.    They pointed to several steps which had been successfully taken by the industry to increase its efficiency and to reduce the cost of production, including the joint establishment of companies for such purposes as the disposal of i.aste products, the mutual insurance of employers&apos; liability, and the manufacture of reeds and healds.    They also claimed credit for trie support given by the industry to technical education and scientific research, and urged generally that the industry showed every mark of vitality and of constant effort to secure higher efficiency and reduced costs.75.    The opponents did not question the efficiency of those branches of the Industry which are concerned with men&apos;s wear, in which Great Britain is admittedly supreme, but they criticised the Bradford trade for alleged want of initiative, foresight and energy in adopting the more economical methods of producing women&apos;s dress goods which are common on the Continent, as regards the use of materials, the restriction of waste and the adoption of cheaper processes of production and finishing. Among these cheaper processes they laid special stress on the production of single warp fabrics, which were shown in evidence to form the great bulk of French exports of dress goods, and also on the cheaper qualities of face-cloths In which German manufacturers specialise,    ithile aomitting that the British goods are superior in durability, they urged that the present demand is not so much for durable tissues as for Inexpensive tissues of good appearance and draping qualities, and that the applicants were not sufficiently adapting themselves to these conditions of demand.
further specialisation and better organisation on the part of the British manufacturers, and that if the benefit of all possible economies were secured, the applicants could meet the foreign competition of which complaint was made, without the aid of any Import duty.    Lastly, they urged that one cause of the present Inability of the applicants to compete was that the initiative in setting the fashions in women&apos;s dress fabrics lies with the foreign (mainly the French) manufacturers,  just as Great Britain sets the fashions and consequently has the initiative as regards fabrics for men&apos;s wear.77.    It seems to us that for the purpose of answering this question it Is necessary to distinguish between two somewhat different conceptions of what is meant by &quot;reasonable efficiency and economy&quot;.    If It means the level which an industry might reasonably be expected to attain after adopting all possible means of economy and the elimination of waste, and after utilising to the highest possible point the results of the latest research and the most modern and effective forms of industrial equipment and organisation, then we should certainly hesitate to answer the present question in the affirmative, and indeed there are probably but few industries with regard to which an affirmative answer could without qualification be returned if such tests were applied.78.    If, on the other hand, the expression &quot;reasonable efficiency and economy&quot; is to be interpreted in a relative sense, as meaning the level to be reasonable exacted under existing economic conditions, the question assumes quite a different aspect.    For example, it would be unreasonable to expect an undertaking to realise the full economies of mass production by specialising in the bulk production of goods for which the available market demand is too limited to carry off the supply.   Ho at far a remedy for difficulties of this order coulc be found in amalgamation or trade agreements which would
permit or enjoin a greater degree of specialisation In particular mills and thus secure the advantages of a longer run&apos; of production,  is a matter for the consideration of the industry, and we have reason to believe that this and other aspects of the problem of &quot;rat ionaligat ion&quot; are at present occupying the minds of some of the leaders of the Industry.79.   We do not conceive it to be our duty within our terms of reference, to attempt to give specific advice to the applicant industry as to its own internal economy and organisa-t ion, and in any case the evidence which is before us is insufficient to enable us to do so with advantage.     Any movement towards internal re-arrangement and re-organ isat ion must, to have the best chance of success, be a spontaneous movement from within.     The fact, however, that leaders of the industry are more and more realising the importance of eliminating all forms of wasteful and duplicated effort, may be regarded as being pro tant o a mark of &quot;reasonable efficiency and economy&quot; within the meaning of the White Paper.      It  is to be remembered that each step towards &quot;rationalisation&quot; usually demands fresh capital expenditure, which it may be financially difficult for a depressed branch of trade to incur, although ultimately the result of such expenditure may be improved efficiency and economy.      It would, we think,  be unreasonable to exact from an industry, as a preliminary condition of safeguarding the realisation of economies that could only be attained as the result of financial rehabilitation, which may possibly be at present beyond its unaided powers.80. It was not quite clear whether the opponents claimed that the mere fact that fashions in women&apos;s dress goods mostly originate in Prance, is evidence of want of efficiency on the part of this country (an argument which, if valid, would apply also to all Continental manufacturers except those of Prance), or whether they only intended to urge that the applicant manu-facturers were unduly sluggish in following the fashions.      Si
any case we are unable to attach much importance to the argument,  in view of the evidence of the alertness of British manufacturers to symptoms of changing fashion, and the steps which, according to the evidence, are being taken by the Yorkshire manufacturers to confer and keep in touch with the wholesale and retail distributors.81.   ^hile, therefore, we give full weight to the criticisms which have been put before us by the opponents, and while we are far from holding that there is no room for improvement in the organisation of the applicant industry both on the productive and distributive sides, wE CONSIDER THAT, JUDGED BY THE STANDARD OP WHAT  IS COMMERCIALLY PRACTICABLE UNDER PRESENT CONDITIONS, THE APPLICANT  INDUSTRY IS CARRIED ON WITH REASONABLE EFFICIENCY AND ECONOMY .(7)   Whether the imposition of a duty on goods of the class or description in question would exert a seriously adverse effect on employment  in any other industry,  being an industry using goods of that class or description in product ion.&amp;2.    In the first place it is to be observed that this question relates solely to the effect of a duty on employment  in the &quot;using&quot; industries, and has no direct reference to the effect of a duty on the cost or standard of living of the ultimate consumer.     The interest of the consumers, however, enters into account  indirectly from one point cf view,  inasmuch, as a rise in price may restrict their demand for the products of the &quot;using&quot; trades, and hence exert an adverse effect on employment  in those trades.83.    In the second place it must be noted that though the question refers generally to &quot;any other industry&quot; which uses the products on which It is proposed to impose a duty, the applicants in the present case w e re a ppa rent ly only concerned to safeguard the interests of the garment-making trades, by applying a .duty not only to fabrics imported in the piece,  but also to- 32 -
fabrics Imported in the form of made-up garments or cut ouc for the purpose of making-up.     They expressed themselves as not interested in extending the duty to all the miscellaneous manu-factured articles, ranging from upholstered furniture to tennis balls, which may contain a certain quantity of woollen or worsted tissues within the specified weight limits.     They desired, however, to apply the duty to woollen and worsted tissues imported in such forms as curtains, tablecloths, rugs or shawls.84 o    Of course the fact that the applicants did not ask for any duty on tissues embodied in the products of the miscellaneous manufacturing trades above referred to, though it would simplify the task of the Customs in assessing and collecting the proposed duty,  is by no means a conclusive proof that the effect of such a duty would exercise no &quot;seriously adverse effect&quot; on these trades.     As, however, no evidence was called by the opponents throughout the Enquiry as to any injury likely t o be caused by the proposed duty to any using trade other than the &quot;making-up&quot; trade, and as none of these other trades appeared in opposition to the application,  it  is reasonable to infer that they do not consider their interests seriously menaced.85.   The following observations, therefore, will be solely concerned with the effect of the proposed duty on the industries concerned with the making of apparel.      On this subject three witnesses appeared for the applicants and one for the opponents. One of the witnesses for the applicants represented the IShdlesale Mantle and Costume Manufacturers&apos; Federation of Great Britain. The other witnesses were manufacturers of apparel who gave evidence in an individual capacity.86.   The general effect of the applicants&apos; evidence was that the garment-making industry ^hich makes use of women&apos;s dress goods, whether home manufactured   or imported, has no anxiety as regards the effect of the proposed duty on the volume of demand for garments by consumers.     They appeared to be confident that
iiiowing to tho wide range of prices for garments, the duty would not be felt, or at all events would not be consciously realised, by the public,    Garments are made to be sold retail at fixed prices ranging from a few shillings to several pounds, and it would, it is claimed, be possible to maintain the same range of prices by slightly adjusting the quality of the material or the method of trimming or making-up.    It was admitted that no such adjustment was possible in the case of the lowest grade garments.    Of course the purchasers of the various grades of garments would, in effect, be paying more for equal goods, since the goods which they would be obtaining at the same price would presumably be inferior or less attractively trimmed.    As already pointed out, however,  question 7 is not directly con-cerned with the consumers&apos;  standard of living,  except in so far as their demand for garments may be restricted, and on the whole we feel bound to give weight to the evidence submitted on behalf of the garment-making industry, that this demand will not be seriously diminished in volume, though it will be somewhat changed in incidence.87. The evidence called by the opponents was directed mainly to the effect of a duty on the export and re-export trade, but their witness expressed the view that a duty on these goods would deflect demand towards garments made of other materials such as artificial silk.    Question 7, however,  is concerned solely with employment in the &quot;making-up&quot; and other using trades (which are not restricted to the use of wool textile goods),  so that there seems no reason why employment in these trades should be adversely affected even if tho suggested diversion took place.88. The sole point on which, according to the evidence, the organisations of the making-up trades feel serious anxiety is the possibility that they may be exposed in the home market to keener competition from imported garments, unless the duty on
the tissues embodied in such garments be so assessed and leviedas &quot;to make it effective&quot;.    The attitude of these trades, sofar as it he.s been represented to the Committee is apparentlyexpressed by the following resolution of the trade Federation:-&quot;That this Executive Council of the Wholesale Mantle and Costume Manufacturers&apos; Federation of Great Britain is prepared to support the Bradford manufacturers in their application under the Safeguarding of Industries procedure, providing any duty imposed on imported woollen or worsted material contained in imported made-up garments is on a&apos;n ad^valorem basis, the rate of duty on such imported made-up garments to be not less than the highest rate of duty which may be imposed on imported woollen and worsted material by the yard.&quot;As the language of the applicants&apos;  statement of case appearedsomewhat ambiguous, we thought it our duty at an early stage ofthe Enquiry to express Our view clearly as to the extent towhich it was possible, within the limits of our reference, to contemplate a duty levied in respect of imported made-up goodscontaining dutiable tissues.    The statement made by the Committeewas as follows:-&quot;The Committee are unanimously of opinion that the reference before them is solely in respect of import duties on certain specified categories of woven tissues and fabrics, and that the words &quot;whether in the piece or in any other form&apos; do not extend the reference to cover safeguarding duties on any of the various classes of imported made-up or manufactured articles into which these tissuos or fabrics may have entered. These words only provide that th6 tissues or fabrics which are the subject matter of the reference may be dutiable when imported in some form other than piece goods, for example,  in the form of garments or other made-up or manufactured articles.    This interpretation does not of course touch the question of the character,, amount, or modo of assessment of any duty on tissues which on technical or other grounds may be deemed appropriate to the form in which they are imported. That is a matter not of interpretation at all but for evidence and argument, always on the assumption that any claim for a duty is .established.&quot;89. As will be seen from the above statement we are clearly of opinion that within the limits of the presentreference it would not be admissible to claim that the proposedduty should be levied on the total value of imported garments,sinoe that value is not wholly,  or for the most part mainly,derived from the value of the material which is tho sole subject
matter of any proposed duty.    As, however, we pointed out, this finding does not exclude the possibility of overcoming technical Customs difficulties by suitable adaptations of the duty whether in respect of form, amount or method of assessment, when applied to made-up articles, provided always that it remain     in essence a duty on the fabric and not in respect of tho whole value of the garment.    We return to this point in connection with question 3.90. Though the resolution of the Council of the Wholesale Mantle and Costume,Manufacturers&apos; Federation was passed before the Committee&apos;s announcement,  the evidence of the representative of the Federation was given a month after that announcement was publicly made,  and it must be presumed that this evidence in favour of the application was given with full knowledge that the specific conditions laid down in the resolution could not be literally complied with.      It was admitted in evidence that no consultation with the constituent members of the Federation had taken place subsequent to the Committee&apos;s announcement, but in the absence of any evidence to the contrary, we presume that the Executive Council acted within its constitutional powers as exponent of their views.91. The representative witness urged that the duty ^evied on the cloth in imported garments should be higher than that levied on material in the   .piece, both in order to take into account wastage in manufacture,  and generally to prevent Increased competition in made-up goods.      He did not attach any substantial importance to a drawback on the export of garments made in this country from imported materials.93. On the other hand, the witness called by the opponents who was a manufacturer and importer of women&apos;s apparel, expressed
the opinion that some of his own trade &quot;both for export and re-export would be lost if the proposed duty were imposed, seeing that a drawback would be unworkable, and that if the exported goods were raised in price some of his oustomers would buy the made-up garments direct from the Continent.93.    We may say at onoe that we are in agreement with the opponents that a drawback on exported garments made of imported dutiable material would not be praoticable, and we have ascertained that this view is strongly held by the Customs authorities.     The case of artificial silk goods is not really analogous, since the import duty on artificial silk is accompanied by an excise duty.      It is, however, unnecessary to enter into technical details,  since the . applicants did not make it an essential part of their case that a system of drawbacks should be established, though some of their witnesses favoured such a system.94.   We take the view that the weight of such evidence as was given supports the conclusion that, provided that any proposed duty be effectively applied to tissues embodied in imported made-up garments, there is no likelihood of it exercising any seriously adverse effect on employment In the garment-making trades.      ACCORDINGLY,  (SUBJECT TO THE ABOVE-MENTIONED CONDITION) OUR ANSWER TO QUESTION 7  IS IN THE NEGATIVE.(8) Whether, having regard to the above conditions, theapplicant Industry has, in the opinion of the Committee, established a claim to a duty;    and, if so, what rate or rates of duty, in the opinion of the Committee, would be reasonably sufficient t&quot;o countervail the&quot; unfair competition.95.    In replying to this question we desire to recall the observations which we made earlier in this Report as to thelimits of our reference.     The question to which,  in accordancewith those observations, we now address ourselves, Is in effectwhether or not the tenor of the replies which we have given tothe previous questions taken as a whole,  supports the claim of
the applicants for the imposition of an import duty, always assuming that any cDaim so established be not over-ridden by other relevant considerations which lie outside the scope of the White Paper.96.  ON THE WHOLE, WE HAVE COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT (SUBJECT TO THE CONSIDERATIONS SET OUT IN PARAGRAPH 94 WITH REGARD TO THE MAKING-UP TRADE) THE ANSWER TO THE QUESTION THUS FORMULATED MUST BI US THE AFFIRMATIVE, SO FAR AS CONCERNS THOSE TISSUES AND FABRICS BETWEEN THE WEIGHT LIMITS OF TWO OUNCES AND ELEVEN OUNCES TO THE SQUARE YARD,  WHICH FALL WITHIN THE-CATEGORY OF ViOMIN&apos;S DRESS GOODS,  AS DEFINED IN PARAGRAPH 33,97. We do not consider that on merits any case was made out by the applicants for a duty on any class of Imported fabrics other than women&apos;s dress goads.    It was common ground that, as regards woollen and worsted woven tissues for men&apos;s wear, this country is capable of holding Its own without a duty, and that the imports of this class of woollen and worsted tissues are at present very small.    The light tissues used for underclothing, which were imported to a considerable extent before the war, have since been largely displaced by cotton or artificial silk or by knitted goods.98. The conclusion at which we have arrived undoubtedly gives rise to a practical question of some difficulty.    Although the present imports of tissues to which the application relates are mainly women&apos;s dress goods, the other categories .&apos;of goods which are within the application form an important section of the British woollen and worsted industry.    Moreover, we are convinced that a duty confined to &quot;women&apos;s cress goods&quot; would be administratively impracticable.    A Customs officer could not be expected to decide whether any particular articles were or were not &quot;women1a dress goods&quot;* and in fact there would be a number of difficult boroer-line cases in which, the same material was used both for women1 a dresses and for other purposes
99.  IP THEN OUR FINDING BE ACCEPTED IT WILL PROBABLY BE NECESSARY FOR ADMINISTRATIVE PURPOSES TO APPLY THE DUTY TO ALL CLASSES OF WOOLLEN AND WORSTED TISSUES WITHIN THE WEIGHT LIMITS.. It is tr^ie that such a course would nominally have the effect of rendering dutiable certain classes of goods for which no need of &quot;safeguarding&quot; has been shown, but, as pointed out above, these classes of goods though forming an important section of British production, form only a small proportion of the Imported goods. It may, therefore, be thought preferable to extend an?/ duty to these classes of goods In order to render the duty administratively practicable, rather than to reject the application altogether, which seems to be the only alternative.100.   If on the above grounds it be decided to impose a duty, the question arises as tc the rate or rates &quot;vrhich would be reasonably sufficient tc countervail the unfair competition&quot;.101. In accordance with the reply given to question 5 we estimate that the average rates of hourly earnings in the French woollen and worsted industry are probably on the whole lower than those prevailing in Yorkshire by between one-third and cne-half.    The evidence showed that the average labour costs form roughly 30 per cent of the total cost of production of British woollen and worsted tissues.    If, however,  it were possible to assume that the average efficiency of the labour employed was identical in the two countries,  the difference of hourly earnings would   correspond to en average deficiency of from 10 to 15 per cent in total productive costs as compared with those of Great Britain.102.    Before applying the above percentage,  to determine the rate cf duty which would be reasonably sufficient to counter-balance the competitive advantage arising from the deficiency, two qualifications have to be made -  (1) the assunroti.cn of equal efficiency in the French and British labour employed Is probably not justified, and some deduction ought,  therefore, to be made
far the superior efficiency of British labour, (2) the per-centages are based not on the selling price of the foreign good-but on British productive costs, which according to the evidence are generally higher than the foreign selling price, in the case of women&apos;s dress goods.     The ad valorem duty necessary to countervail the deficiency would be somewhat raised on this account.      The information before us does not enable us to estimate either of these allowances exactly, but as they act in opposite directions it seems not unreasonable to set them offagainst each other.      ON THIS ASSUMPTION, THE REQUIRED RATE OP DUTY WOULD LIE BETWEEN 10 AND 15 PER GENT AD VALOREM.      The uncertainty of some of the data precludes us from putting forward a closer estimate with confidence.      It is noted, however, that the figures&apos; of 12-g per cent, arrived at by the previous Committee lies midway between the limits of the above range.103.    The applicants desired, in order to prevent evasion by the addition of moisture, that the upper weight limit should be raised to twelve ounces.     We are not competent within our terms of reference to make any. recommendation with regard to goods which do not fall within the scope of the application.     Woollen and worsted, tissues contain a certain amount of moisture, and we were informed that the Bradford Conditioning House experience no difficulty in measuring this moisture content. The applicants&apos; fear can, therefore, be met by providing that not more than the standard of moisture content usually obtaining in the trade be allowed in ascertaining the weight of imported fabrics.   &apos; &apos; -104.    The further question arises of the mode of assessing the duty on tissues imported in other forms, e.g., in the form o  made-up   garments.
105.    The special difficulties to be surmounted in applying the duties to goods imported in this form arise from the fact that it is impossible without taking the garments to pieces to ascertain whether or not the goods fall within the specified weight limits, or what is the yardage of the dutiable tissues. As, therefore, for reasons already given it is inadmissible to levy the duty on the whole value of the garment it will be necessary to resort to more or less arbitrary estimates of yardage, e.g., that 3 linear yards of 54 inches width, or 4^ square yards are used on an average for each dress or costume, including due allowance for waste in cutting.     We think that in the case of women&apos;s garments  (which are readily distinguishable as such) it would be a safe assumption that the great bulk of the material used falls within the weight limits specified in the application.106.   Doubtless, however, a certain quantity both of women&apos;s and of men&apos;s garments is imported which consists of woollen or worsted fabrics falling outside the weight limits, though in viexv of the evidence as to the character of the foreign competition this quantity must be relatively small.     We have considered carefully how to meet the difficulty of assessing the weight per yard of fabrics imported In the form of garments, but after consulting the Customs authorities we can see no practicable way of solving the problem.     We have, therefore, come to the conclusion that if a duty is to be levied on any , class of woollen or worsted tissues Imported in the form of garments it is essential that it should be levied on all such tissues irrespective of their weight.     Our own reference being limited to tissues within given weight limits, we can only commend to the consideration of the competent authorities whether as the only means of making the duty administratively feasible in respect of the dutiable class of woollen and worsted tissues
Imported in the form of garments, it may not be justifiable to extend somewhat the application of the duty so far as concerns made-up garments in the way indicated above.107.   Assuming that the above administrative difficulty be surmounted, we have to consider the form and amount of any duty on tissues Imported in the form of made-up garments.     An import duty of between 10 and 15 per cent, on 4i? square yards of dress goods valued at 3/6d. per square yard (which appears to be a fair average import price for tissues within the weight limits), would amount to between l/7d. and 2/4d. per dress or costume, the wholesale selling price of which would probably be between  2   and  3.      If this be taken as an average, WE THINK THAT THE ACTUAL DUTY SHOULD BE GRADUATED ACCORDING TO A SUITABLE SCALE OP VALUES, RISING PROM (SAY) 6d.  IN THE CASE OP THE CHEAPEST GARMENTS,  THE IMPORT VALUE OF WHICH IS TEN SHILLINGS AND UNDER,  UP TO A MAXIMUM OF (SAY) 3/6d.  IN THE CASE OP GARMENTS VALUED AT  4   AND OVER.      WE THINK THAT THE ABOVE SCALE WOULD BE EQUALLY   APPLICABLE TO MEN&apos;S HEAR.108.    We consider that all other classes of manufactured goods containing woollen and worsted tissues should be specifically exempted from duty, as no case for &quot;safeguarding&quot; was made out in respect of any of these goods, and in some cases the collection of a duty would be extremely troublesome for the Customs and would involve great interference with trade109.    We think that provision should be made for the exemption from duty of woollen and worsted tissues in the piece which contain only a small proportion,  say up to 10 per cent, by weight of wool or hair.     We also hold the view that certain considerations put before us by the Huddersfield Chamber of Commerce, with the view of avoiding the double imposition of
duty on woollen and worsted tissues containing an admixture of silk or artificial silk, should receive favourable considera-tion.110. &quot;&quot;We understand that it is the usual practice tc allow a drawback of import duty when dutiable goods are re-exported in the same form in which they were  imported.      We,  therefore, think that if an import duty is levied upon fabrics and garments; a corresponding drawback should be granted on re-exportation.      As already stated  (paragraph 93) we consider that a drawback on exported garments made from imported dutiable material would not be practicable.We cannot close this Report without recording our warmest appreciation of tho able and devoted services rendered through-out this prolonged Enquiry by our Secretaries.      Both Captain Brady and Mr. Reardon have been most assiduous and helpful In a case which has made unusual demands on their time and involved an exceptional amount of exacting detail.We are, Sir,Your obedient Servants,H.
