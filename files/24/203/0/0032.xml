Printed for the Cabinet.   May 1929.CONFIDENTIAL.Copy No.      28CP. 132 (29).CABINET.[F 1697/250/10]Memorandum on Shanghai by Sir F. Whyte.[Circulated by direction of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.]I GIVE you my appreciation of the Shanghai situation. It is composed, as you will no doubt realise, from information from all sources; but the interpretation is my own. The matter on which I am most in the dark is the present intentions (if any) of His Majesty&apos;s Government.1. The retention of Shanghai as the secure economic base of operations for Chinese and foreigner alike is very important. This does not mean that the present form of municipal government is the best, but it does mean that a definite guarantee of security from disorder and a minimum of municipal service are essential.2. The Chinese will be satisfied with nothing less than Chinese control. ;1 The Chinese&quot; here means the local caucus of the Kuomintang, the labour unions and other elements which compose the organised propagandist force of the Nationalist movement. At present the Nanking Government takes little stock in the &quot; Shanghai question,&quot; (a) because it does not want to pick an open quarrel with the foreigner, and especially with us; (b) because it is after bigger game and isn&apos;t quite sure what the result of Japan-baiting is going to be; (c) because it can trust to the local agitator in Shanghai to keep the pot simmering.3. The status quo, which is unstable, leaves the question of Chinese representation in an unsatisfactory position; and I hold the opinion strongly that one of the real reasons why the whole foreign interest in Shanghai is in such jeopardy to-day is Shanghai&apos;s refusal to look ahead in the past. That is spilt milk; and I only mention it because it suggests a very serious weakness in the political judgment which directs Shanghai policy of which we must take account now.4. There are two ways of looking at Chinese representation : (1) The open door to municipal decay; (2) the opportunity, through Sino-foreign co-operation, to train the next generation in decent government. Precipitate action leads straight to the first result, therefore any large increase of Chinese municipal councillors must be rejected. Please observe that I say rejected, not resisted; for we must continue to act as though we were responsible. If we act responsibly, and get the necessary Government support, we can gradually solve the representation question, and with it the Shanghai question as a whole; if we act irresponsibly, we may as well shut up-shop. The rejection of a large increase is not the end; we must offer a-reasonable increase, coupled with an effective programme of Chinese entry into all branches of the council&apos;s administration. I know all the objections to this form of signification (faked architects plans, tuberculous cows passed by Chinese vets, &amp;c), but they can all be silenced by this one challenge : &quot; What is your alternative ? &apos;&apos;5. Assuming we agree among ourselves (i.e., British Chamber of Commerce, British Government, &amp;c), we still have to secure the assent of Japan and the United States of America; and the process of securing their assent will raise if it has not been raised before the question of increasing the numbers of the Shanghai Municipal Council, which, when settled, will leave us in a permanent minority. These two facts must therefore be faced : (a.) This is an international question, in which the Japanese and American claims are now serious rivals to ours, and it is no longer possible to retain British control, which in practice no longer exists, even if there were no Chinese demand for municipal rights.
(b.) Any new agreement, when made, will probably put us actually in ;1 recognised minority in the council, while probably still leaving our majority in the ratepayers intact. In a word, for the sake of a settlement, we shall have set the seal of an international compact on our sacrifice of municipal power, without being sure that our chief partners in the compact (the United States of America and Japan) will take their full share of responsibility for it. Once more we shall be carrying the baby; and we&apos;ve got to do it. If Japan and the United States of America come in and take their part in guaranteeing the International Settlement against disorder, no one will be better pleased than I; but we must devise our plans on the only-too-valid assumption, that America will shirk her international duty; and Japan will say that Nagasaki is near enough to absolve her from keeping troops in China. We can count on Japan as the more reliable, but she looks at Shanghai through. Manchuria; and she takes, moreover, a different view of the position of the foreigners in China from ours.6. The conclusion from this is that His Majesty&apos;s Government must take the principal part in any negotiation re the future of the settlement, that the agreement (if any) must be between the two (or more) Governments, and that His Majesty&apos;s Government must take the responsibility of saying that England will regard any attempt to disturb the then existing status quo as a breach of the agreement, which gives her the right to guarantee the security of Shanghai by the best available means. In a, word (1.) We make our agreement, in terms which amply recognise Chinese rights in Shanghai, but not Chinese ambitions in present form, with the deliberate intention of preparing the way for the Chinese to exercise greater responsibility.(2.) We make it through His Majesty&apos;s Government because the Government holds the sanction which can enforce it, and the municipal council does not.(3.) We take effective steps to see that it is not disturbed during its currency.7. The key to success in a ticklish question like this is courage : of two kinds. First, we must be far-sighted enough to look forward to the true goal of our effort and brave enough to back our judgment in framing a policy Avhich depends partly on common sense, partly on goodwill, partly on luck, and partly on the courage to use force at the right moment. Second, we must not be afraid to say that we will yield nothing to the threat of disorder; or, in other words, we will use force to defend ourselves, our people and our rights. We have said this a hundred times in other parts of the world, and we can say it in China without offence. No one can accuse me of swashbuckling, and there is no diet I like less than &quot; blood for breakfast.-&apos;8. Two questions remain:. (1) When to negotiate? (2) What armed force is necessary, and where? On the first, practically every foreigner in Shanghai, including even moderate Englishmen, says that this is not the moment to move. I detect a distinct hardening of opinion which is the inevitable result of recent occurrences in Hankow, the Kiangnan opium case, the provisional court, &amp;c. It is also partly due to the prevailing uncertainty about His Majesty&apos;s Governments intentions. I sympathise with those who take that view, but since it tends to become a permanent and inelastic frame of mind, I scent danger in it. At the present moment there is just as good reason for optimism as pessimism, and having little use for either feeling I can only interpret the facts of the case in the light of my general reading of the whole situation. I am preparing a review of the position to-day. Avhich I will send you soon; and, meanwhile, I can sum it up by saying that by midsummer the Chinese domestic problem will be clearer than it is now; and, either stability will have increased, or else there will be a real crash. I put my money on &quot; stability &quot; for reasons which I shall state in the review referred to.Since there is good reason to await the resrdt of the Third Kuomintang Conference in March, and since that result will only be clearly visible after the lapse of a month or two, my view is that we should allow the next three months to pass, get a new council in office, and use our best endeavours in the meantime to persuade His Majesty&apos;s Government to accept the conclusion stated in paragraph 6 above. I do not conceal from you the possibility that local elements may try to force the pace by boycott or other mass movements in the immediate future, but I think
we can face that issue with some composure, because we have two battalions here and because I do not think that local agitation will get active support from NankingThe answer to my first question, therefore, is : &quot;Not immediately, but soon.&quot; The choice of the actual moment may be left to future decision; but &quot;we must use the next few months in securing His Ma.jesty&apos;s Governments assent to the principle 1 have outlined and in laying the foundation of constructive progress in the settlement. If we wait too long we may find ourselves driven to make a patchwork agreement in a crisis which will satisfy no one.I leave aside, for the moment, the question of the number of Chinese councillors, and also the eventual size of the council. These are essentially questions to be settled in the negotiation itself.9. There remains my second question: the armed force necessary to guarantee the new regime a sufficient period of undisturbed operation.Now. it is quite certain that the War Office and the Treasury will use every effort to keep the total strength in the Far East as low as possible. It is equally certain that the Foreign Office wall seek to withdraw the present Shanghai force very soon. We are on a twodmttalion basis now, and probably these two will be withdrawn from Shanghai during the trooping season of 1929 (October-November). I consider that it is politically wise to do this: and the guarantee must therefore be found in the maintenance of an effective mobile force at Hong Kong (i.e.. not on Chinese territory); and in making our final depositions we must leave no doubt why we make them.&apos; Normally, the maintenance of order within the settlement must be in the hands of the council: and equally we must rely on the Chinese to cope with any limited threat to law and order throughout Greater Shanghai, but the final sanction on which the new regime will rest must be our powder, and we must not be afraid to use it.Shanghai, February 22, 1929.
