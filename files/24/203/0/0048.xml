Printed for the Cabinet.   June 1929.SECRET. Copy No.   24CP. 148 (29).CABINET.IRISH FREE STATE.Compensation for Civil Servants under Article X of the Articles ofAgreement.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.THE previous history of this complicated and difficult question is set out in a memorandum (CP. 357 (28)), circulated to the Cabinet by my predecessor, a copy of which I annex for the information of my colleagues.On consideration of that memorandum it was decided by the Cabinet that the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs should initiate discussions with Irish Free State Ministers as to the action to be taken on the Report of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in the case of Wigg and Cochrane; and as a result of those discussions an agreement was reached which was approved by the Cabinet and announced to the House of Commons on the 20th February last in the following terms : &quot;An agreement has been reached between His Majesty&apos;s Governments in the United Kingdom and in the Irish Free State that as soon as the necessary detailed arrangements for the purpose can be made, His Majesty&apos;s Government in the Irish Free State shall pay to all transferred Civil Servants who before the 1st March next have either already been awarded compensation under the provisions of Article 10 of the Articles of Agreement or nave given notice of intention to retire under the provisions of that Article, compensation on the basis laid down in Article 10 as interpreted by the Judicial Committee in Wigg and Cochrane&apos;s case, together with any arrears of compensation which may be due on that basis, and that His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom shall recoup to His Majesty&apos;s Government in the Irish Free State the difference between the amount so paid and the amount which would have been paid but for the decision of the Judicial Committee.I am informed that a further Agreement has been reached between His Majesty&apos;s Government in the Irish Free State and representatives of the transferred officers still serving in the Irish Free State under which such officers as may give notice of retirement under Article 10 on or after the 1st March, 1929, will be entitled to compensation on the basis of the terms set out in the Govern-ment of Ireland Act, 1920, together with the Treasury Minute of the 30th March, 1922; conlpensation in such cases will be assessed finally by a special statutory tribunal, the membership of which will provide for representation of the transferred officers; and certain statutory safeguards will be provided for the position of transferred officers in respect of such matters as conditions of service, &amp;c. To enable effect to be given to this Agreement concurrent legislation will be required here and in the Irish Free State, and His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom have undertaken to introduce the necessary legislation here.&quot;Inasmuch as this Agreement involves a modification of Article 10 of the Articles of Agreement of the 6th December, 1921, it was necessary that, as in the case of the [19315] b
two previous amendments of the Articles of Agreement, it should be embodied in precise terms to which statutory effect could be given by legislation in the Parlia-ments of the United Kingdom and of the Irish Free State, ft was also desirable to ensure that the terms of the Agreement should be such as would be acceptable to the transferred Civil Servants concerned.An Agreement on&apos; these lines has been drawn up, and has been the subject of full discussion between representatives of the Irish Free State Government and of the Civil Servants concerned on the one hand, and between officers of the Irish Free State Government and of the British Government on the other. A copy of the draft Agreement is annexed. The Irish Free State Government are prepared to sign an Agreement in this form and I understand that it will be accepted by the Civil Servants concerned. I therefore recommend that it should be accepted by the British Government.It will be seen that the Agreement provides as follows : (1.) In the cases referred to in the announcement of the 20th Februarycompensation shall be awarded on the lines laid down by the JudicialCommittee in the Wigg and Cochrane judgment (Articles 3, 6 and schedule), the British Government to repay the Free State Governmentthe excess payment involved (Article 13).In all other cases awards to be in accordance with the Britishpractice which was adopted prior to the Wigg and Cochrane Judgment(Article 6 and Schedule).(Payment of the extra compensation involved to date has alreadybeen made by the Free State Government and repaid to them by theBritish Government.) (2.) All outstanding and future claims to compensation shall be referred to a statutory tribunal, whose decision shall be final (Articles 4 and 5). (3.) Subject to (1) above, all awards made up to 1924 on the advice of theCommittee presided over by Mr. Justice Wylie shall be deemed to be final and conclusive (Article 3). (4.) As regards awards made by the Free State Government since that committee ceased to function, an appeal will lie to the new tribunal(Article 7).(5.) The opportunity has been taken to clear up certain doubts which have arisen (a) as to the right of a transferred officer to compensation in the event ofthe conditions of his service being altered to his detriment (Article 8),(b) as to suspension of compensation on re-employment in the publicservice (Article 12), and(c) as to the method of assessing compensation in the case of officers whohave been promoted (Articles 10 and 11).(6.) In view of the delays which have occurred, the &quot; transitional period &quot; within which notice of retirement may be given is extended (Article 9).The draft Free State Bill which gives the force of law, so far as the Free State is concerned, to the Agreement has been carefully examined, and my advisers are satisfied that it contains nothing which is inconsistent with the Agreement or which modifies in any respect not sanctioned by the agreement the rights conferred on civil servants by Article 10 of the Articles of Agreement.The legislation (which will consist simply of a one-clause Bill) required on this side to ratify the Agreement cannot of course be introduced until July at the earliest, but it is, in my opinion, very desirable that the Agreement should be signed immediately, in order that the necessary legislation may be introduced at once into the Free State Parliament, which rises at the end of June until October. The Free State Government cannot set up the proposed Tribunal until the necessary legislation has at least been introduced into their Parliament, and the legislation cannot be introduced until the formal Agreement is signed. There has already been inevitable delay since the lines of agreement were first announced in February last, and there is reason to fear that if the Agreement is not signed in time to enable the Free State Bill to be introduced into the Free State Parliament before it rises at the end of this month the settlement laboriously negotiated by the Free State Government with the transferred officers may be jeopardized and a fresh series of actions commenced in the Courts.
The Agreement represents a negotiated settlement with the staff concerned of a question which has been dragging on since 1924, when legal proceedings were first instituted. For all this time several hundred Civil Servants who wished to retire have been retained in the Free State Service pending a decision as to the basis on which compensation was to be awarded to them, and no further progress can be made with the settlement of their claims until the proposed new Compensation Board has been set up.On this side no objection whatever has been raised to the proposed settlement, and public faith has been clearly pledged by the announcements of the 20th February.In these circumstances, I ask that I may be authorised to sign the Agreement forthwith.S. W. -Dominions Office, June 18, 1929.APPENDIX I.Draft Agreement.Agreement Interpreting and Supplementing Article Ten of the Articles of Agree ment for a Treaty between Great Britain and Ireland to which the Force of Lai.&apos; was given by the Irish Free State (Agreement) Act, 1922, and by the Constittitior? of the Irish Free State (Saorstdt Eireann) Act, 1922.1. ARTICLE 10 of the Articles of Agreement for a Treaty between Great Britain and Ireland signed at London on the 6th day of December, 1921, and confirmed and ratified by the Irish Free State (Agreement) Act, 1922, and the Constitution of the Irish Free State (Saorstat Eireann) Act, 1922, shall be construed with reference tojthis Agreement, and the said Article 10 shall have effect and be deemed always to have had effect accordingly.2. In this Agreement the expression &quot;transferred officer&quot; includes every official, civil servant, or other public servant who by virtue of any transfer of services has been transferred from the service of the Government of the late United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland to the service of the Provisional Government or the service of the Government of the Irish Free State or has heretofore been or shall hereafter be transferred from the service of the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland to the service of the Government of the Irish Free State, but does not include any member of a police force nor any person whose services were lent by the Government of the said late United Kingdom to the Provisional Government.3. Where the Minister for Finance of the Irish Free State has, before the date of this Agreement and in acordance with a recommendation, whether general or particular, made to him by a committee set up by him to advise him as to the payment of compensation under the said Article 10, granted or refused to grant com-pensation under the said Article 10 to a person claiming to be a transferred officer, such grant and the award made thereon (but subject as respects cost of living borms to the terms of this Agreement) or such refusal (as the case may be) shall be and be deemed always to have been a final and conclusive determination of the claim of such person for such compensation and such person shall be entitled accordingly to such compensation or to no compensation as the case may be.4. There shall be established in the Irish Free State in the manner prescribed by legislation to be passed for that purpose by the Oireachtas of the Irish Free State a board (hereinafter called the Board) to hear and determine every claim pending at the date of this Agreement or hereafter to be made by any person claiming to be a transferred officer for compensation under the said Article 10 and to hear and determine every other matter which shall be referred to them in pursuance of this Agreement.5.   The Board shall have exclusive jurisdiction to determine the right of any person claiming to be a transferred officer to compensation under the said Article 10 [19315] b 2
and the amount of such compensation (if any) and all matters incidental to such determination, and the Board may for the purpose of such determination take into consideration in relation to any transferred officer any matter which the Civil Service Committee mentioned in section 56 of the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, might under that Act have taken into consideration when considering a claim by such person for compensation under that Act, and every such determination by the Board shall be a final and conclusive determination of the claim of such person to compensation under the said Article 10.6. The amount of compensation payable under the said Article 10 to a transferred officer who is found by the Board to be entitled to such compensation shall be determined by the Board in accordance with the Rules set out in the Schedule to this Agreement.7. Where the Minister for Finance of the Irish Free State has before the date of this Agreement granted or refused to grant compensation under the said Article 10 to a person claiming to be a transferred officer, every dispute which shall hereafter arise between the said Minister and such person in relation to such grant or refusal or (in the case of a grant) the compensation granted and, in particular, every dispute which shall so arise as to whether such grant or refusal is or is not, by virtue of this Agreement, .a final and conclusive determination of the claim of such person for such compensation shall be referred to and decided by the Board, and the decision of the Board thereon shall be final and conclusive.8. Provision shall be made by legislation, to be passed by the Oireachtas of the Irish Free State, for enabling a transferred officer who is required to perform duties which are not analogous and are an unreasonable addition to his duties at the time of his transfer, or whose position has been materially altered to his detriment owing to changes in the conditions of his employment, to retire from the service of the Government-of the Irish Free State with the same right to compensation as if he had been discharged by the said Government within the meaning of the said Article 10 and for the determination by the Board of any dispute as to the right of a transferred officer so to retire.9. Notice by a transferred officer of his desire to retire from the service of the Irish Free State in consequence of the change of Government within the meaning of the said Article 10 may be given at any time up to, but not after, the 5th day of December, 1929, or,- in the case of a transferred officer who is transferred to such service after the 5th day of December, 1929, within one year after the date of such transfer.10. Where a transferred officer has received or hereafter receives promotion (whether by way of increase of salary or by appointment to another grade or situation) in the employment of the Provisional Government of Ireland or in the employment of the Government of the Irish Free State, any compensation to which he has become or hereafter becomes entitled under the said Article 10 shall (save in the cases provided for in the next following paragraph of this Agreement) be computed by reference to the salary and emoluments of the grade or situation which he held immediately before he received such promotion or the first of two or more such promotions and as if he had continued in that office or situation.11. Where a transferred officer in the service of the Provisional Government of Ireland or the service of the Government of the Irish Free State has received or hereafter receives promotion (whether by way of increase of salary or by appoint-ment to another grade or situation, but not including acting-promotion) in either of those services, and such promotion was or is in the customary course of promotion in or from the grade or situation which he held at the time of his transfer to the said service and was or is otherwise promotion such as he would normally (at the time he was so promoted) have received in or from the last-mentioned grade or situation if the change of government mentioned in the said Article 10 had not taken place (whether such promotion was or is received in or to a department which was, or in or to a department which was not in existence at the time of such change of government), any compensation to which he has become or hereafter becomes entitled under the said Article 10 shall be computed by reference to the salary and emoluments of the grade or situation held by him immediately after such promotion or the latest of two or more consecutive such promotions.12. The Oireachtas of the Irish Free State may provide by legislation that when and so long as a transferred officer in receipt of compensation under the said Article 10 is employed in any situation in a public department in Great Britain, the Irish Free State or Northern Ireland, such compensation may be suspended wholly
where his remuneration in such situation equals or exceeds his remuneration in the office on account of retirement or discharge from which such compensation was granted, and in any other case to such extent as will render the total of such com-pensation and his remuneration in such situation equal to his remuneration in the office on account of retirement or discharge from which such compensation was granted.In this paragraph the expression &quot;situation in a public department&quot; includes (a) any situation which is remunerated wholly or partly out of moneys (otherthan a single grant or occasional grants not renewed from year to year) provided by the Oireachtas of the Irish Free State or bv the Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland or by the Parliament of Northern Ireland; and(b) any situation in Great Britain, the Irish Free State or Northern Irelandwhich is a public office within the meaning of the Superannuation Act, 1892, or any enactment amending the same; and(c) any situation in or under or as a paid member of the Currency Commission,the Electricity Supply Board, or the Agricultural Credit Corporation, Limited; and(d) any situation in or under or as a paid member of a board or body establishedby or under the authority of an Act of the Oireachtas, passed after the passing of this Act, which the Minister for Finance of the Irish Free State shall by order declare to be a public department for the purposes of this paragraph.13. His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland agree to pay to His Majesty&apos;s Government in the Irish Free State the amount by which the compensation payable in accordance with this Agreement to transferred officers who have given notice, before the 1st day of March, 1929, of their desire to retire under the said Article 10 from the service of the Govern-ment of the Irish Free State, or have been discharged before that date from the service of the said Government, exceeds the sum to which such compensation would amount if the same were calculated in the manner prescribed by this Agreement in respect of compensation payable to transferred officers who give notice on or after the 1st day of March, 1929, of their desire so to retire from the said service or are discharged on or after that date from the said service.14. His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and His Majesty&apos;s Government in the Irish Free State respectively shall as soon as possible introduce into their respective Parliaments such legislation as may be necessary to give statutory effect to this Agreement, and this Agreement shall not take effect until such legislation in such Parliaments shall have been passed into law.Schedule to the Foregoing Agreement.1. In the case of a transferred officer to whom the Eighth Schedule to the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, would apply if the compensation were being calculated under that Act, the compensation shall, subject to the provisions of this Schedule, be calculated in accordance with the Rules contained in the said Eighth Schedule, and for the purposes of such calculation-(a) the Rules contained under Head A of Part I of the said Rules shall applyto retirement in consequence of the change of Government within, themeaning of the said Article 10, (J) the Rules contained under Head B of Part I of the said Rules shall applyto discharge by the Government of the Irish Free State within themeaning of the said Article 10,(c) the transitional period referred to in the said Rules shall be deemed to end. on the 5th day of December, 1929, save that, in the case of officers who are transferred to the service of the Government of the Irish Free State after the 5th day of December, 1929, the transitional period shall be deemed to end at the expiration of one year after the date of such transfer, and .(d) where a transferred officer (not being an officer transferred to the service ofthe Government of the Irish Free State after the 5th day of December, 1929) who has duly given notice on or before the 5th day of December,
1929, of his desire to retire from the said service in consequence of the change of Government within the meaning of the said Article 10 continues in the service of the Government of the Irish Free State after the 5th day of December, 1929, the period between that date and the actual date of retirement of such officer shall be reckoned in calculating his years of service, but increments of salary accruing to him after the said 5th day of December, 1929, shall not be taken into account in calculating the compensation payable to him..2. In the case of a transferred officer to whom section 54 of the Government bf Ireland Act, 1920, or any subsection thereof wOuld apply if the compensation were being calculated under that Act, the compensation payable to such officer shall be of such character and amount as the Board shall think proper having regard to all the circumstances of the case and, in particular, having regard to any limitation which would apply to such compensation by virtue-of the said section 54 if such com-pensation were being calculated under the said Act.3. In the case of a transferred officer to whom none of the foregoing Rules apply, the compensation payable to such officer shall be of such character and amount as the Board shall think proper having regard to all the circumstances of the case.4. The following provisions shall apply to that portion (if any) of the compensation payable to a transferred officer tinder Article 10 of the Treaty which consists bf an annual allowance computed on cost of living bonus on the civil service sliding scale, that is to say (a) the said annual allowance shall be computed by reference to a standard ratebased upon the bonus appropriate on the Civil Service sliding scale to a cost of living figure of 105, this standard rate being increased or reduced, as the case may be, by one twenty-first for each complete 5 points by which the index figure appropriate to the quarter in which the officer retires (or if he retires on the last day of the quarter to the ensuing-quarter) exceeds or falls short of the said index figure of 105-;(b) the annual allowance so computed shall (subject to the limitation hereinaftermeutioned where the same applies) be re-assessed quarterly on the above basis by reference to the official cost of living index figure for the Irish Free State appropriate to each quarter :(c) the said quarterly re-assessmehts Of the said annual allowance shall be madeon fixed quarterly dates, which shall be the same for all such annual allowances, and the first such quarterly re-assessment of any particular such annual allowance shall take place on whichever of the said fixed quarterly days first occurs after the commencement of such annual allowance :(d) in the case of a transferred officer who gave or shall give notice on or afterthe 1st day of March, 1929, of his desire to retire from the service of the Government of the Irish Free State, or has been or shall be discharged on or after that date from the service of the said Government, the said annual allowance shall not at any time exceed the amount at which it would be calculated if it were computed by reference to the cost of living index figure on which the cost of living bonus paid to such officer immediately before his discharge or retirement was computed.5. That portion (if any) of the compensation payable to a transferred officer under Article 10 of the Treaty, which consists of a gratuity calculated according to the provisions of section 6 of the Superannuation Act, 1859, or of ^an additional allowance or lump sum calculated according to the provisions of the Superannuation Act, 1909, shall, in so far as the same is computed by reference to cost of living-bonus, be computed,(a) in the case of a transferred officer who gave notice before the 1st day of March, 1929, of his desire to retire from the service of the Government of the Irish Free State, or was discharged before that date from the service bf the said Government, on the full amount of the cost of living bonus, computed by reference to the official cost of living index figure for the Irish Free State for the time being in force, appropriate oh the civil service sliding scale to the salary of such Officer on which such gratuity, additional allowance or lump sum is calculated, and
(b) in the case of a transferred officer who gave or shall give notice on or after the 1st day&apos;of March, 1929, of his desire to retire from the service of the Government of the Irish Free State, or has been or shall be discharged on or after that date from the service of the said Government, on seventy-five per cent, of the cost of living bonus which, if computed by reference to the official cost of living index figure for the Irish Free State appro-priate to the quarter in which the officer retires, would be appropriate on the civil service sliding scale to the salary of such officer on which such gratuity, additional allowance or lump sum is calculated.APPENDIX II.IRISH FREE STATE.Compensation for Civil Servants under Article X of the Articles ofAgreement.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.MY colleagues will be aware that in their Report delivered on the 13th November (a copy of which is annexed as Annex I) the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council upheld on every point, although on different grounds, the decision of the previous Board in Wigg and Cochrane&apos;s case. The effect of this Report, arid of the previous decision, is that the civil servants concerned, some 2,000 in number, have been declared to be entitled to arrears of pension and lump-sum payments, estimated by the Treasury to amount to some  50,000, and to a future increase in pension, estimated to amount to some  3,000 to  4,000 per annum.According to Press Reports, Mr. Blythe (the Free State Minister of Finance)&apos; has announced that the Free State Government decline to pay these amounts. I have asked the Minister for External Affairs how soon we may expect to receive a com-munication as to the action contemplated in the matter, but have not yet received a reply.  Meanwhile it is necessary to consider the position which has arisen.For this purpose it is desirable to summarise very briefly the previous history of this matter.The Government of Ireland Act, 1920, contained certain provisions as to the compensation of civil servants transferred from the service of the Government of the United Kingdom to that of the Government of Southern Ireland or Northern Ireland, as the case might be, who, as a result of such transfer, might lose their employment, either by dismissal or voluntary resignation. Briefly stated, the com-pensation was to be calculated in the same manner as the pensions of British civil servants are calculated under the Superannuation Acts, but for the purpose, of calculating their compensation, the civil servants concerned were to, be allowed to count more than their actual years of service, and to include certain hypothetical increments of pay. Apart from these additions, it was clearly the intention of Parliament that transferred Irish civil servants should be placed in as favourable, but not in a more favourable, position as regards pensions than British civil servants.So far as the Irish Free State was concerned, the Government of Ireland Act never came into operation; but the provisions referred to above were imported into the Articles of Agreement between Great Britain and Ireland of 1921, Article X of which states that &quot; The Government of the Irish Free State agrees to pay fair compensation on terms not less favourable than those accorded by the Act of 1920 (i.e., the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, referred to above) to ... . public servants who are discharged by it or who retire in consequence of the change of Govern-ment effected in pursuance hereof.&quot;
Ike Articles of Agreement were given the force of law by the Irish Free State (Agreement) Act, 1922, and Article X was subsequently imported into the Irish Free State Constitution, Article 78 of which provides that &apos;&apos; Every such existing officer who was transferred from the British Govern-ment .... shall be entitled to the benefit of Article X of the Scheduled Treaty.&quot;The Constitution further includes a provision (Article 66) that &apos;&apos; Nothing in this Constitution shall impair the right of any person to petition His Majesty for special leave to appeal from the Supreme Court to His Majesty in Council or the right of His Majesty to grant such leave.&quot;The Constitution was made statutorily binding upon the Free State by Act 1 of Dail Eireann, and upon Great Britain by the Irish Free State Constitution Act, 1922 (Session 2).In the course of the passage through Parliament here of the various Acts by which the Irish Free State was constituted, amendments were moved to insert clauses providing for the payment to transferred civil servants, who might be dismissed or resign, of the compensation laid down in Article X of the Articles of Agreement. These amendments were successfully resisted by the Government (although one of them was carried in the House of Lords) on the ground that the provisions of that Article were already made statutory by their inclusion first in the Irish Free State (Agreement) Act, and then in the Constitution Act; but at the same time the Government stated explicitly and on several occasions that, in the event of the Free State Government failing to pay the compensation provided for in Article X, they themselves and their successors stood as guarantors for the payment of such compen-sation to the persons entitled thereto As the exact terms of these guarantees are of importance, it will be well to set them out at length.On the 19th December, 1921, Mr. (now Sir) Austen Chamberlain stated: &apos;&apos; The .... officials concerned are assured of treatment not less favourable than that provided in the Government of Ireland Act, and His Majesty&apos;s Government will be the guarantor of their pensions.&quot; (Debates, the 19th December, 1921, Col. 413.)On the 8th March, 1922, the then Colonial Secretary (Mr. Churchill), in the course of the Debate on the Report stage of the Irish Free State (Agreement) Bill, quoted the above statement, and added :  . -&quot; In the ultimate issue we are the guarantor of their pensions.&quot; (Debates, the 8th March, 1922, Col. 1342-3.)On the 22nd March, 1922, Lord Peel stated in the House of Lords: &quot;The position is that, in the first place, the obligation of paying thesepensions .... falls on the Government of the Free State.....   behind them, of course, there stands the British Government, who have given their guarantee that if these men suffer the British taxpayer will come to therescue.....These men are perfectly safe.   In the first instance, they haveto rely upon the Government of the South of Ireland, and if that Government fails, the pledge has been most distinctly given that behind them is the guarantee . of the British Government.&quot;   (Debates, the 22nd March, 1922, Cols. 780-781.)On the 31st March, 1922, Mr. Churchill said :-&quot;I take this opportunity of renewing what we have repeatedly said on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government, namely, that, in the event of default on the part of the Irish Government, the British Government accepts full responsibility for the liability which is prescribed in the present legislation. What is that liability? It is the liability laid down in the Act of 1920.&quot; (Debates, the 21st March, 1922, Col. 1753.)
On the same date, the Chief Secretary for Ireland, Sir Hamar Greenwood, said : &quot; I come now to what is, I think, the only outstanding point, the question of guarantee. As has been said again and again, the pledge of Ministers is considered by the Government to be sufficient guarantee that the pensions and all payments to these public servants in Ireland will be paid, if not by the Free State Government, then by the Government that sits upon this Treasury Bench. Let me say that I know of no question that has been before the House in the present generation which has been supported so unanimously by the heads of all the parties in the House and by the House generally. The suggestion that the undertaking given to-day would be cancelled by some succeeding Government was unreasonable.&quot;  (Debates, the 21st March, 1922, Col. 1772.)On the 28th November, 1922, the Lord Chancellor (Lord Birkenhead) said : &quot; I have not, and never have had, the slightest doubt that the ultimate &apos; position of this country, by whatever. quasi legal terms you may attempt to describe it, must be that of a guarantor to a liability which was incurred in pursuance of Imperial interests.&quot;  (Debates, the 28th November, 1922, Col. 66.)On the 1st December, 1922, the then Lord Chancellor (Lord Cave) stated that-&quot; The Constitution provides that all of them (i.e., transferred civil servants) shall be entitled, in the event of their giving up office, to the benefits of Article X of the Treaty, i.e., to be compensated by the Free State Government for loss of office. Article X provides the form and the extent of the compensation. It is to be regulated by the provisions of the Act of 1920 provisions which were fully considered at the time with representatives of the Civil Service, and accepted by them as satisfactory.&quot;   (Debates, the 1st December, 1921, Col. 195.)It will be seen from the above quotations that the form of the guarantee varied somewhat. Sometimes the Act of 1920 is mentioned, sometimes the Articles of Agreement. It can hardly be doubted, however, that the guarantee was understood at the time, and is still understood, to be a guarantee of the Compensation payable under the Articles of Agreement whatever that might be. Until recently, i.e., until judicial proceedings were instituted, it was assumed that the compensation payable under the Articles of Agreement would not differ from that payable under the Act of 1920. Indeed, we have ourselves admitted to the Free State Government (see the despatch of the 20th January, 1928, of which a copy is annexed as Annex II) that we agree that it would not be equitable that the transferred civil servants should receive more favourable treatment in the matters in question than if they had remained in the Civil Service of this country.The possible courses of action open to us may be summarised as follows :  (a.) We may attempt to persuade the Free State Government to accept the decision of the Judicial Committee, that is to say, themselves to pay in full the amounts involved in that decision. It could be pointed out to them that the right to apply for leave to appeal to the King in Council, and of His Majesty to grant leave, is clearly stated in the Constitution, and equally clearly implies that the decision on any such appeal will be regarded as binding on the Government and Courts of the Free State; and that the Constitution was the result of a solemn bargain entered into as recently as 1921. I feel certain that any such attempt would be foredoomed to failure. The Irish Free State Government is so deeply committed to a refusal to find the money that for them to yield now would probably mean their fall; indeed, even if they had not committed themselves, I doubt whether they could safely agree. Their position is by no means secure; and it is certain that the only alternative Government, namely, a Government under Mr. De Valera, would be even less likely to pay regard to the Judicial Committee&apos;s decision.(&amp;.) We can inform Messrs. Wigg and Cochrane, and any other of the persons concerned who apply to us for payment of the sums withheld by the Free State Government, that we are not prepared to pay until they have taken such steps as are open to them to secure payment from the Free State Government by an application to the Free State Courts. It seems to me to be likely that the Free State Courts would regard themselves as bound by the decision of the Judicial Committee in Wigg and Cochrane&apos;s case and would give judgment accordingly. But it seems to be equally likely that, in the event of such an application being made to the Free State Courts, the Free State Government would at once introduce and rapidly pass into law[19315] c
legislation to the effect that Article X of the Articles of Agreement was to be deemed to mean, and always to have meant, that the compensation therein provided for was to be assessed in the manner hitherto adopted by the Free State Government. It will be remembered that it was in this manner that they evaded the effect of a previous adverse decision by the Judicial Committee, but oh that occasion the legislation so introduced only purported to interpret one of their own Acts and not an Article of the Treaty. Unilateral legislation purporting to interpret one of the Articles of the Treaty would be an unquestionable breach of the Treaty; and whether or not the Free State Courts were to regard such legislation as valid (in view of the provision in the Free State Act giving the force of the law to the Constitution, that &quot; if any provision . ... of any law .... is in any respect repugnant to any of the provisions of the Scheduled Treaty it shall .... be absolutely void and inoperative&quot;), it is clear that the passage of such legislation would create a constitutional crisis far more serious than that created by the refusal of the Irish Free State Government to accept the decision of the Judicial Committee.(c.) We may say to the Free State, in effect: &quot; We agree that it was not the intention of either party to the Treaty that the transferred civil servants should receive more favourable treatment in the calculation of their pensions than if they had remained in the Civil Service of this country. The Judicial Committee has now decided that, if that is what the Treaty was intended to mean, it did not, in fact, carry out that intention. Both parties are equally responsible for the bad drafting of the Treaty and both parties should therefore share the extra cost involved. If you will pay half (or any other proportion), we will pay the remainder.&quot; To this the Free State Government would probably reply : &quot; This particular provision of the Treaty was inserted at your request and in your interests. It was for you to see that it was properly drafted and we are not prepared to accept any responsibility for your mistake.&quot; It could hardly be denied that there would be considerable force in this contention; and, in any case, for the reason given at (a) above, namely, that they are too deeply committed, I see no likelihood that the Free State Government would agree to pay even half of the extra sums now payable.id.) In agreement with the Irish Free State, legislation might be introduced both here and in the Irish Free State interpreting Article X in accordance with what was undoubtedly the intention of both parties to it. There is, of course, no question that the Articles of Agreement can properly be amended by bilateral legislation of this kind-indeed, two such amendments, have already been made and it will be remembered that it had already been agreed between the two Governments and announced in Parliament (both here and in the Free State) that such legislation would be introduced, before, at the suggestion of Lord Reading in the course of the Debate in the House of Lords on the 25th April last, it was decided to refer the matter back to the Judicial Committee. There seem to me to be serious objections to this course. In the first place, the justification for the previous decision to legislate was that the decision of the Judicial Committee was vitiated or tainted by a mistake of fact. No such justification can be how alleged; and it would, in my opinion, be a very dangerous precedent to acquiesce and co-operate in legislation to reverse a decision of the Judicial Committee in the circumstances now existing, whatever may be the abstract merits of the point at issue. Secondly, it is to be observed that the recent Report of the Judicial Committee raises a point which has not hitherto been under consideration. The terms of Article X of the Treaty are that the persons affected thereby shall be entitled to &quot; fair compensation on terms not less favourable than those accorded by the Act of 1920 &quot; ; but the Report appears to be to the effect, not that the compensation actually awarded wras less than that which would have been awarded under the Act of 1920, but that &quot;fair&quot; compensation might, and, indeed, should be, something more. We may agree or disagree with the view taken by the Judicial Committee (if that is, in fact, their view), but Ave should find it yery difficult to.justify to Parliament the introduction of legislation to enforce a level &quot;of compensation which the Judicial Committee has pronounced, rightly or wrongly, to be less than fair. . Finally, apart from either of the considerations mentioned above, it seems tome to be very unlikely that, even if such legislation could be passed through the House of Commons, it could be passed through the House of Lords.(e.) The last possible course is that we should decide, and announce forthwith to Parliament, that in pursuance of our predecessors&apos; guarantee, we will ourselves put the Irish Free State Government into a position to pay the extra sums involved in the Judicial Committee&apos;s decision. That decision must presumably be held to be binding
not only in the cases of Wigg and Cochrane, but also in the case of all those who have been or may in the future be dismissed, and of all those who have retired or may retire before the 31st March next (that date being the end of the period, within which voluntary retirement on the terms of Article X is allowed) in circumstances entitling them to compensation. It is not possible to estimate with very close accuracy the amount involved, but as indicated above, it may be assumed that such a decision would necessitate an immediate payment of some  50,000, and an annual payment, diminishing until it disappears on the death of the last pensioner, of some  3,000 to  4,000.On the whole I feel that this course is open to less objection than any of the others. It will no doubt be pointed out in Parliament that we are acquiescing in a deliberate flouting of the authority of the Judicial Committee by the Free State Government, and we shall probably be urged to take drastic action to compel them to recognise that authority. For the reasons given at (a) above, I do not think that any useful purpose would be served by protesting to the Free State Government. Furthermore, while the form and tone of the recent statements made on behalf of the Free State Government is to be deplored, and while I would not suggest that we should in any way appear to countenance a defiance of the Judicial Committee, I am bound to say that, on the strict merits of the case, there seems to me to be much to be said for their point of view^ as, indeed, we have ourselves admitted in the despatch of the 20th January, referred to above. They accepted Article X of the Treaty and have, until now, faithfully carried it out, but they have always regarded the liability for the pensions of Judges, civil servants and police as an unduly heavy burden upon a small and impoverished country. Those pensions are based upon salaries substantially in excess of what would normally have been paid, or are now being paid, in a country of the size of the Free State; and the number of public servants who have seized the opportunity to retire on substantial pensions and engage in other pursuits at a salary in many cases in excess of their previous salary has been very considerable. When on top of this a totally unexpected decision calls upon them to increase these pensions in a manner which was certainly not intended by either party to the Treaty, and so as to place the persons coneeined in a position substantially more favourable than their colleagues in this country, it is not altogether to be wondered at that they protest, much as we may regret the form of their protestation.If course (e) is accepted by the Cabinet as the most probable ultimate solution, it is, in my opinion, of considerable importance that we should proceed in such a way as to forestall as far as possible any open defiance of the Articles of Agreement by the Irish Free State Government. From this point of view the most effective procedure would appear to be that we should not ourselves, either now or in future, make the additional payments necessary to implement the judgment, but, as I have indicated above, that we should provide the Irish Free State Government with funds to enable them to do so. This procedure would not only be administratively more convenient, but would also create a situation in which the Free State Government would appear to be formally complying with the judgment. From the Parliamentary point of view we could defend the action taken on the ground that, whilst the Report of the Judicial Committee has created a situation in which we no longer feel justified in following the procedure which had been previously agreed upon with the Free State Government as equitable, we nevertheless have a special responsibility towards the civil servants affected, and have acted in accordance with that responsibility.The immediate action which I propose is that the Chancellor of the Exchequer and I should initiate discussion with Free State Ministers at the earliest possible date, and that we should put to them proposal (c) above, on the understanding that if, as seems likely, that proves to be unacceptable, we have authority to proceed as at (e).(Initialled) L.

Annex 1.Special Reference in the matter of Certain Questions relating to the Payment of Compensation to Civil Servants under Article X of the Articles of Agreement for a Treaty between Great Britain and Ireland.Report of the Lords of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council,delivered november 13, 1928.Present at the Hearing:Marquess of Reading. Lord Alness.Lord Phillimore. Chief Justice Anglin.Lord Han worth.[Delivered by the Marquess of Reading.]This matter was referred to the Judicial Committee by an order of His Majestv in Council made under Section 4 of the Judicial Committee Act, 1833.The questions in issue relate to the principles applicable to the determination of the compensation payable to those Civil Servants in the service of the Crown who were transferred to the Irish Free State after the 20th March, 1922, and were discharged or have retired in consequence of the change of Government, effected by the establishment of the Government of the Irish Free State in pursuance of the Articles of Agreement for a Treaty made between Great Britain and Ireland. The amount of the compensation payable was determined by the Government of the Irish Free State in accordance with the principles laid down in certain minutes of the British Treasury, and in particular the minute of the 20th March, 1922. The question referred to their Lordships is whether the payment of compensation so determined in respect of Civil Servants or other officials or public servants trans-ferred to the service of the Provisional Government or of the Government of the Irish Free State after the 20th March, 1922 is a payment of compensation within the meaning and true intent of Article X of the Articles of Agreement.Article X is as follows :- &quot; The Government of the Irish Free State agrees to pay fair compensation oh terms not less favourable than those accorded by the Act of 1920 to Judges, Officials, Members of the Police Forces and other Public Servants who are discharged or who retire in consequence of the change of Government effected in pursuance hereof.&apos;&apos;This Act of 1920 is the Government of Ireland Act, 1920.The arguments before their Lordships covered a wide range, and raised some problems difficult of solution which lay on the fringe of the question referred, but which fortunately it is not necessary for their Lordships to solve.Before proceeding to deal with the arguments at the hearing before the Board it is desirable to pass in brief review the facts and circumstances which have led to the present dispute.In the year 1920 it was contemplated that changes should be made in the government &quot;and administration of Ireland, and accordingly the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, was passed. Power was given to establish Parliaments in Southern and Northern Ireland and executive authority within the limits reserved by the Act. It was further provided by Section 55 that existing Irish officers in the service of the Crown should continue to serve in Ireland and in the new Govern-ments to be formed, and should hold their offices upon the same tenure and the same conditions as hitherto. In order to protect those officers who might be removed from office or might wish to retire in consequence of the change to be effected in the govern-ment of Ireland, provision was made for payment to them of compensation to be calculated in like manner as the superannuation allowances or gratuities had been applicable to them, with certain additional concessions on the terms and conditions contained in the Eighth Schedule of the Act and the Rules thereunder.Under these provisions an officer in an established capacity in the service of the Crown who wished to retire under the statutory conditions would receive as compen-
sation under this Act an annual allowance or pension calculated in like manner as the superannuation allowance he would be qualified to receive under the Superannuation Acts, 1834 to 1914, if he retired on the ground of ill-health, supplemented for the purpose of that calculation by certain additional years of service and certain notional increments of salary.The annual allowance or pension payable under the Superannuation Acts, 1834-19,14, to a Civil Servant who retires on the ground of ill-health after not less than ten years&apos; service is one-sixtieth of the salary and emoluments of his office at the date of his retirement for each year of service. A new system was introduced under the Superannuation Act of 1909 for the benefit of those officers who elected to avail themselves of it. They became entitled to an annual allowance calculated upon one-eightieth instead instead of one-sixtieth per year of service, and in addition to a lump sum payment of one-thirtieth of the salary and emoluments for each year of service, such payment not to exceed one and a half times the amount of the salary and emoluments. During the War the remuneration was increased by what was termed a bonus. At first no part of the bonus was included for the purpose of the calculation of these allowances, but gradually it was recognised by the Treasury and particularly by the minute of the 20th March, 1922, that the bonus had become a regular part of the Civil Servants&apos; remuneration, and that it should be taken into account in computing the retiring allowances. The bonus is not a fixed sum like the salary, but is variable and is calculated on a sliding scale by reference to the official index figure of the cost of living.The scheme of Government under the Act of 1920 was superseded in December, 1921, by the Articles of Agreement for a Treaty between Great Britain and Ireland, which by Article 17 provided for a provisional arrangement for the administration of Southern Ireland during the transitional period, pending the constitution of a Government of the Irish Free State. By Irish Free State (Agreement) Act, 1922, passed on 31st March, 1922, force of law was given to these Articles, and provisions were made for carrying the Treaty into effect. . In pursuance of this Act an order in Council of 1st April, 1922 was issued transferring the functions in connection with the administration of public services in Southern Ireland to the Provisional Govern-ment, and in &quot;December, 1922, the Irish Free State was established, and the Con-stitution was enacted by Act No. 1 of the Dail Eireann. Article 77 of the Constitution (1st Schedule to the Act) provides that every existing officer (subject to the exception therein mentioned) of the Provisional Government at the date of the coming into operation of this Constitution &quot; shall on that date be transferred to and become an officer of the Irish Free State . . . and shall hold office by a tenure corresponding to his previous tenure.&apos;&apos; By Article 78 &quot; every such existing officer who was transferred from the British Government by virtue of any transfer of services to the Provisional Government shall be entitled to the benefit of Article X of the Scheduled Treaty.&quot; This statute made the Articles of the Treaty part of the municipal law of the Irish Free State. In consequence of these enactments existing Irish officers transferred to the Provisional Government, and later to the Irish Free State, became entitled by Irish Free State law to the benefit of Article X of the Treaty.The compensation payable by the Irish Free State Government to those officers who were discharged by the Government or who retired because of the change of Government effected in pursuance of the Articles for the Treaty, and who came within the provisions of Article X, was assessed by the Minister of Finance of the Irish Free State assisted by a Committee carefully selected for this purpose. It is not disputed that the Minister of Finance assessed the compensation in accordance with the principles set forth in the minutes of the British Treasury, including the minute of the 20th March, 1922, but the Civil Servants were dissatisfied with a part of the award and claimed that the compensation so determined was not fair compensation within the meaning of Article X. They raised objections to the award in respect of, inter alia, the following two matters : (1.) In regard to the portion of the annual allowance which: is computed on the bonus as distinguished from the fixed salary it was made a condition of the award that this portion should be adjusted quarterly by reference to the official figure of cost of living, and should be reduced according to the sliding scale when the cost of living figure fell, but that it should not be increased beyond the amount ascertained at the date of retirement if the cost of living figure rose. This principle is known as the over-riding maximum.    ----- -
(2.) In regard to that portion of the lump sum payment which is computed on the bonus, the award was based upon 75 per cent., and not urjon the whole of the bonus payable for the quarter preceding the date of retirement.The meaning and intent of Article X and the principles upon which the compen-sation payable under it should be assessed, including the principles relating to the over-riding maximum and the 75 per cent, above mentioned, were considered by the Judicial Committee on the hearing of the Appeal in the case of Wigg and Cochrane v. The Attorney-General of the Irish Free State [1927] A.C., p. 674. The plaintiffs in the action were two Civil Servants who sought to enforce their claims under Article X in the Courts of the Irish Free State. In expressing their opinion allowing the appeal in favour of the two Civil Servants, the Board, when referring to the effect of the minute of the 20th March, 1922, upon the claims, assumed that these officers had at the date of the minute been transferred to the Government of the Free State, and held that the minute could not affect their rights. These officers were, in fact, not transferred to the Government of the Irish Free State until after the date of this minute, and it was contended that the advice tendered to His Majesty was tainted, if not vitiated, by this error of fact. It is because of this misapprehension by the previous Board (its effect upon the decision will be considered later) that the present reference was ordered.At the outset of the hearing in this reference, Mr. Dickie, who attended their Lordships on behalf of the Council of the Transferred Officers&apos; Protection Association, argued that the Board is bound in law, and without examination, to follow the decision in the appeal in Wigg and Cochrane&apos;s case, whether they considered it to be right or wrong. He maintained that if it was wrong, nothing short of an Act of Parliament could rectify it. Their Lordships are unable to hold that this proposition stated in such an extreme form is established. It may well be that the Board would hesitate long before disturbing a solemn decision by a previous Board, which raised an identical or even a similar issue for determination; but for the proposition that the Board is, in all circumstances, bound to follow a previous decision, as it were, blindfold, they are unable to discover any adequate authority. In other words, no inflexible rule, which falls in all circumstances to be applied, has been laid down.Mr. Dickie based his argument mainly upon cases in which one of the parties to a suit which had been decided against him, or a person who Avas not a party to the suit, applied for a rehearing of it. Their Lordships must hoAvever point out. in considering these cases, that they have no direct application to the matter before the Board, as this Reference is not a rehearing of the claims in Wigg and Cochrane&apos;.&apos;! case. Now there can be no doubt that, in the early cases, a rigid standard Avas applied to the competency of a rehearing. Thus, in Rajiindernarain Rae v. Bijai Govind Sing, 1 Moore&apos;s P.C. Cases, p. 117 (1836) (also reported in 2 Moore&apos;s Indian Appeals, p. 181) Lord Brougham, in deliA^ering the opinion of the Board, permitted himself to make some general observations, Avhich seem, at first sight, to favour Mr. Dickie&apos;s contention. In that case an application Avas made for a rehearing. The decision in the earlier case had been given ex parte, and Avas pronounced by default. The earlier order Avas in these circumstances rescinded, and a rehearing Avas allowed. Lord Brougham, in giving the opinion of the Board, hoAvever, said (p. 126) : &quot; It is unquestionably the strict rule, and ought to be distinctly understood as such, that no cause in this Court can be reheard, and that, an order once made that is, a report submitted to Her Majesty, and adopted, by being made an order in Council is final, and cannot be altered.  The same is the case of the judgments of the House ofLords.....Whatever, therefore, has been really determined in these Courts must stand, there being no poAArer of rehearing for the purpose of changing the judgment pronounced.&quot; Lord Brougham then pointed out that trivial errors in draAving up the judgment of the Board might competently be corrected. He then proceeded to add : &quot; With the exception of one case in 1669, of doubtful authority here, and another in Parliament of still less Aveight in 1642 (AAdiich Avas an appeal from the Privy Council to Parliament, and at a time when the Government was in an unsettled state), no instance, it is believed, can be produced of a rehearing upon the Avhole cause, and an entire alteration of the judgment once pronounced.&quot;The case referred to by Lord Brougham as &quot;of doubtful authority&quot; Avas Dumaresq v. Le Hardy, 11th March, 1667-68, (p. 127 of the report stipra). There it was alleged that a matter of fact had been misrepresented to the earlier Court, that consequently the point in question was mistaken, and that the cause had been determined against the petitioner^ clear and undoubted right and contrary to laAV.
An order for rehearing was there made and the case was reheard though, in the result, the Boafd adhered to the former decision.The case of Fenton v. Hampton (1858), 11 Moore&apos;s P.C. Cases, p. 347, cited during the argument related to another proposition which dealt with the binding character of an earlier decision upon the Board in a later case. The Board there said (page 396): &quot;We think that we are bound by the decision in the case of Kielly v. C&amp;person (1841), 4 Moore&apos;s P.C. Cases, p. 63, the greater authority of which, as compared with Beaumont v. Barrett (1836) 1 Moore&apos;s P.C. Cases, p. 59, it is quite unnecessary to enlarge upon.&quot; In Kielley v. Carson the Board had refused to follow the earlier decision of Beaumont v. Barrett for reasons which do not touch the argument in the present case. These decisions do not contribute to the solution of the problem in issue.Reference may also be made to the case of the Singapore (1866) L.R. 1 P.C., p. 378, which again related to rehearing. In refusing a petition for rehearing, the Board at p. 388 said : &apos;&apos; We do not affirm that there is no competency in this Court togrant a rehearing in any case.....Although it is within the competency of theCourt to grant a rehearing, according to the authorities cited above, still it must be a very strong case indeed, and coming witliin the class of cases there collected, that would induce this Court so to interfere.&quot;The case which in comparatively recent times comes nearest to formulating a general proposition with reference to the competency of a rehearing is Hebbert v. Purchas L.R. 3 P.C., p. 664. The decision of the Board is thus set out at p. 671 : &quot;Their Lordships are of opinion, in respect of the two petitions addressed to the Crown, that no further proceedings should be taken therein. Having carefully weighed the arguments, and considering the great public mischief which would arise on any doubt being thrown on the finality of the decisions of the Judicial Committee, their Lordships are of opinion that expediency requires that the prayer of the petitions should not be acceded to, and that they should be refused with costs.&quot; It will be observed that the decision turned on expediency, not on competency, and that&apos; the Board abstained from laying down any general rule which is applicable to all cases.The case of Hebbert v. Purchas was considered in Ridsdale v. Clifton, L.R. 2 P.D., p. 276. That was a case which raised the question of the finality of a previous decision, not inter partes, but as against strangers. Having regard to the fact that the case was not concerned with questions of law affecting civil rights of property, but related to the public worship of the Established Church, and that in Hebbert v. Purchas the decision was pronounced ex parte, the Board stated that &apos;&quot;&apos; these considerations have led their Lordships to the conclusion that, although very great weight ought to be given to the decision in Hebbert v. Purchas, yet they ought in the present case to hold themselves at liberty to examine the reasons upon which the decision was arrived at, and, if they should find themselves forced to dissent from these reasons, to decide upon their own view of the law &quot; (p. 307). The Lord Chancellor, Lord Cairns, in giving the decision of the Board, added with reference to decisions relating to civil rights of property : &quot; Even as to such decisions it would perhaps be difficult to say that they were, as to third parties, under all circumstances and in all cases, absolutely final, but they certainly ought not to be reopened without the very greatest hesitation &quot; (p. 306). The door is thus not closed against a request for a rehearing at the instance of a stranger to an earlier decision, even in a case concerned with civil rights of property, although it is plainly indicated that the Board would be slow to accede to such a request.The case of Hebbert v. Purchas was followed in Venkata Narasimha Appa Row v. The Court of Wards and Others, 11 A.C., p. 660 (1886), in which again a petition for rehearing was refused. In delivering the judgment of the Board, however, Lord Watson said (p. 663) : &quot; It is quite true that there may be exceptional circumstances which will warrant this Board, even after their advice has been acted upon by Her Majesty in Council, in allowing a case to be reheard at the instance of one of the parties.&quot; But, he added : . . . . &quot; Even before report, whilst the decision of the Board is not yet res judicata, great caution has been observed in the rehearing of appeals &quot; (p. 663).Again, in the case of Tooth v. Power [1891] A.C. (p. 284), in which a previous decision was urged upon the Board as binding upon it, the Judicial Committee said : &quot; Their Lordships think it right to add that, although, for obvious reasons, the case of Barton v. Muir was relied on as an authority absolutely binding upon them by both parties at the Bar, yet it would have been their duty, had the necessity arisen,
to consider for themselves whether the decision is one which they ought to follow. It was given ex. parte; and, that being the case, although great weight is due to the decision of this Board, their Lordships are at liberty .to examine the reasons upon which that decision was arrived at, and if they should find themselves forced to dissent from these reasons, to decide upon their own view of the law. These are the words used by Lord Cairns when delivering the judgment of the Board in Ridsdale v. Clifton, which contains a full exposition of the law upon this point&quot; (p. 292).In Read v. Bishop of Lincoln [1892], A.C., p. 644, their Lordships referred to Hebbert v. Pnrchas and Ridsdale v. Clifton, and quoted the relevant passages from these decisions to which reference has already been made. The Board proceeded to say: &quot; In the present case their Lordships cannot but adopt the view expressed in Ridsdale v. Clifton as to the effect of previous decisions. Whilst fully sensible of the weight to be attached to such decisions, their Lordships are at the same time bound to examine the reasons upon which the decisions rest, and to give effect to their own view of the law &quot; (p. 655).The result of these decisions is (1) that there is no inherent incompetency in ordering a rehearing of a case already decided by the Board, even when a question of a right of property is involved, but (2) that such an indulgence will be granted in very exceptional circumstances only. It is of the nature of an extraordinarium remedium.The matter now before their Lordships, however, presents features which are widely different from those presented in the cases cited.In the first place, as has already been pointed out, this is not a petition for a rehearing. It is a reference to the Board, under section 4 of the Judicial Committee Act of 1833. If, however, Mr. Dickie is right, the reference may be a futile and sterile proceeding, for, on his argument, one of the parties to it is foredoomed from the outset to failure because of the previous decision. If by that decision the matter of the present reference is res judicata, then the Board has been invited to take part in a solemn farce, involving the waste of judicial time.In the second place, the reference was granted because of an alleged mistake of fact into which the previous Board was alleged to have fallen, and which is said to have been material to the issue determined by it. To suggest that, if that proposition be made out, this Board is constrained, blindfold, to adhere to a decision based on a material error in fact, appears to be repugnant to good sense, and to attribute to the Board, as a Court of final resort, an impotence which would be deplorable. None of the cases cited, unless it be the case of Dumaresq--\vh.ich., quantum valeat, is inimical to Mr. Dickie&apos;s argument deals with such a situation; and none of them appears to present an insuperable obstacle to a different decision being reached by the Board in this case from that pronounced in the case of Wigg and Cochrane.In these circumstances their Lordships considered, after careful attention had been given to the argument on behalf of the Civil Servants, that it was ill-founded in law, and they accordingly informed the learned Attorney-General that they did not think it necessary to require him to reply on this topic.The Transferred Officers Protection Association only challenge in this reference the award of the Government of the Irish Free State upon the two matters above mentioned, the one relating to the over-riding maximum, and the other to the calculation of 75 per cent, in assessing the lump sum payment.Mr. Dickie, on behalf of the Transferred Officers, argued that the claim to fair compensation under the Article was not limited or restricted by limitations or restrictions in the Act of 1920, or in any British Treasury Minute, and that the award in respect of these two matters was not fair compensation within the meaning of Article X.The Attorney-General, who attended their Lordships on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government, and Mr. Overend, on behalf of the Attorney-General of the Irish Free State, contended that the compensation awarded was fair compensation not less favourable than that accorded by the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, that it had been calculated on the principles laid down in the Treasury Minutes, including the Minute of the 20th March, 1922, and that the compensation so assessed was fair compensation within the meaning of the Article.The solution of the problem depends in the first instance upon the meaning to be attributed to the language of the Article. The Articles are part of the statute law of the Irish Free State, and must be construed according to the principles of interpretation applicable to the language, of a statute. Under the Article the Transferred Officers who come within the statutory conditions are entitled to com-
litpensation which is fair and on terms not less favourable than those accorded by the Act of 1920. In their Lordships&apos; opinion, the language of the Article imports that the terms of the Act of 1920 are the minimum which should be receivable by the officers, but these terms are clearly not the maximum that may be awarded. The words are not on the terms accorded by the Act of 1920, but are &quot; on terms not less favourable than those accorded,&quot; and imply by &quot;not less than &quot; that more may be awarded. The words &quot;not less than&quot; cannot be construed as if they were synonymous with &quot; equivalent to &quot; or &quot; the same as.&quot; Their Lordships therefore cannot doubt that the compensation to be awarded is not limited by the terms under the Act of 1920, although these should be considered for the purpose of arriving at the proper award under the Article. It is indeed essential that regard should be had to them, for the compensation would not in any event be fair which was less-favourable than would be awarded under these terms.Their Lordships have next to consider whether an award which imposes two conditions : (1) the over-riding maximum, and (2) the limitation of 75 per cent, of the bonus in regard to the lump sum, is fair compensation under the Article as interpreted by the Board. It follows from the observations already made by their Lordships that the mere fact that the assessment was calculated in accordance with the principles contained in the Treasury minute of the 20th March, 1922, does not establish that the compensation awarded is the true measure of the compensation to which the transferred officers have a legal right under the Article and the constitu-tion of the Free State. Theirs is a legal right, as was decided by the previous Board in Wigg and Cochrane&apos;s case, and the right is not questioned in this reference. The position of the transferred servants under the Article thus differs materially from that of servants of the Crown who have no such legal right. Section 30 of the Superannuation Act, 1834, expressly negatives it: &quot; Nothing in this Act contained shall extend or be construed to extend to give any person an absolute right to compensation for past services, or to any superannuation or retiring allowance under this Act.&quot; Further, it is provided by Section 2 of the Superannuation Act, 1859, that &quot; if any question should arise in any department of the public service as to the claim of any person or class of persons for superannuation under this clause, it shall be referred to the Commissioners of the Treasury, whose decision shall be final.&quot;Their Lordships are not unmindful of Mr. Dickie&apos;s argument that the Treasury minute could be challenged in the Courts by a servant of the Crown, but their Lordships find no justification for this contention. Section 30 of the Superannuation Act of 1834 is unrepealed, and is still the enactment that governs the position. The hvw was clearly stated in Cooper v. The Queen (1880) (L.B.., 14 CD. 311) and. Yorlce v. The King (L.P. [1915], 1 K.B. 852), and was recognised by the House of Lords in Considine v. Mclnerney (L.R. [1916], 2 A.C. 162). In Wigg and Cochrane&apos;s case the previous Board approved these decisions, and affirmed the pro-position that no action could be brought to set aside or vary a decision of the Commissioners of the Treasury. At the hearing in this reference their Lordships were in complete accord with this opinion of the previous Board, and intimated to the Attorney-General that they would not require argument from him in reply. Although their Lordships hold that the Treasury minute of 20th March, 1922, is not binding upon the transferred officers who come within the statutory conditions, the minute requires most careful consideration in arriving at the amount that should be awarded under Article X. The minute was issued by the Commissioners of the Treasury in pursuance of the discretion entrusted to them. It was submitted tc Parliament and is binding upon the servants of the Crown. It announces the decisions of the Treasury on certain disputed matters regarding the calculation of the bonus for the purpose of computing the retiring allowances. After stating that the bonus had now become a regular part of the Civil Servants remuneration, it recites that hitherto 75 per cent, of the bonus payable at the time of retirement had been included in the emoluments upon which, together with the salary, the retiring allowances had been computed. It directs that henceforward all awards of pension should be calculated on the salary and emoluments, together with an addition of the bonus calculated on a sliding scale, by reference to the average cost of living for the three preceding months, and subject to reassessment quarterly. It further directs that, as under the Superannuation Acts the retiring allowances could not exceed a prescribed proportion, appropriate to the retiring Civil Servants length of service, of his salary and emoluments on the date of his retirement, the additional allowance or pension payable at any time will be subject to the over-riding maximum.   This[19315] - d
condition is imposed in relation to those Civil Servants whose rights are limited by the Superannuation Acts, but their Lordships cannot think that it should be applied to the annual allowance or pension payable to transferred Civil Servants, whose rights are governed by Article X and not limited by the Superannuation Acts. It is difficult to understand why in such circumstances the annual allowance, which will be reduced according to the sliding scale when the cost of living figure falls, should not be increased if the cost of living figure rises. The amount of the bonus ascertained at the date of retirement is not conclusive, it may be made to vary and the annual allowance will vary accordingly, but, if it be capable of reduction, it should equally be capable of increase. If, notwithstanding the rise in the cost of. living, the annual allowance was not increased, it would obviously be to the disadvantage of the officer who must submit to reduction should the cost of living fall, and there is no sufficient reason why such a condition should be imposed in regard to officers who are entitled to the compensation granted by the Article. Their Lordships are therefore of opinion that the condition known as the over-riding maximum attached to the award cannot be maintained.In regard to the lump sum payment the Lords of the Treasury came to the con-clusion, having regard to all the circumstances, that it was not possible to devise a more satisfactory plan than to base the award as hitherto upon 75 per cent, of the bonus, to be calculated by reference to the cost of living figure as in the case of annual allowances or pensions. It is to be noted that the proportion of 75 per cent, is retained in regard to the lump sum payment, although it is abandoned for the purpose of the calculation of the annual.allowance. It does not purport to be based upon exact calculation; it is retained at 75 per cent, as a practical method of allowing for the variability factor. The lump sum is calculated (as provided in the Superannuation Act, 1909, Section I, Subsection 2) at a sum equal to one-thirtieth of the annual salary and emoluments multiplied by the number of completed years of service. It is stated in the minute that the adjustment of the lump sum according to this formula could only be based upon broad assumptions and could not be exact. Their Lordships find themselves in agreement with the reasoning in this respect of Meredith, J., who tried the case in the first instance. The calculation on 75 per cent, is an arbitrary rule; it is a rough and ready way of dealing with the difficulty. It was adopted by the Treasury in their discretion as a way out of a perplexing situation. It seems difficult to justify its application under Article X. The lump sum is intended to provide a sum for capital expenditure, it may be for the purchase of a house, or to make provision for dependants, or otherwise. It is a commutation, payable immediately, of part of the pension, which under the Act of 1909 is reduced from the one-sixtieth proportion to one-eightieth. In assessing compensation under the Article their Lordships think it fair and reasonable to arrive at the sum by calculating it on the pension payable at the first year of retirement. Their Lordships therefore agree with the opinion of the previous Board and of Meredith, J., iii this respect, and hold that the calculation should be made upon the full amount of the bonus, and that the limitation to 75 per cent, cannot be sustained.After careful consideration, their Lordships have thus arrived at the same con-clusions as the previous Board. In view of this result, it becomes unnecessary to deal with the ingenious argument of Mr. Dickie, whereby he sought to establish that, although the two officers in Wigg and Cochrane&apos;&apos;s case had not at the date of the minute of 20th March, 1922, been transferred to the Irish Free State, they had on the 2nd March, 1922, that is, before the date of the minute, been transferred from the service of the British Government and, according to his contention, to that of the Government of Southern Ireland, and consequently the minute could not be held to apply to them. No order in Council had been issued which effected this transfer, but Mr. Dickie argued that it must be taken as matter of law that the officers had been transferred on the 2nd March, 1922, because by virtue of section 73 of the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, this was the latest date at which an &quot; appointed day&quot; under the Act could be fixed. Further, he sought to prove by reference to various orders in Council that a Government of Southern Ireland had been set up before 2nd March, 1922, and that existing Irish officers had been transferred to it. He contended also that the Board in Wigg and Cochrane&apos;s case would have been fully justified in assuming that the officers had at the date of the minute been transferred to the Government of Southern Ireland instead of &quot;to the Government of the Irish Free State,&quot; and the same decision would have been reached. The arguments were complicated and raised difficult questions. At the hearing their Lordships were not convinced of the soundness of the propositions advanced, but, in
view of the conclusions of the Board, it has become unnecessary to examine them more closely or to pronounce a final opinion upon them.Their Lordships have given careful consideration to the decision of the previous Board in Wigg and Cochrane&apos;s case, and they are satisfied that the statement regarding the date of transfer of the two officers had no effect upon the advice tendered by that Board to His Majesty. The Lord Chancellor, when expressing the opinion of the Board upon the appeal, said: &quot;The question to be determined is whether and to what extent the disputed conditions are in accordance with the statutes,&quot; and his Lordship then proceeded to give the reasons of the Board for arriving at their conclusions. These are independent of the particular date of transfer, for they are based upon the view that when an existing Irish officer had been transferred to the Provisional Government or the Government of the Irish Free State he became entitled to the benefit of Article X.Their Lordships are of opinion that the claims made in this reference on behalf of the Transferred Officers in relation to the award have been established, and their Lordships will humbly advise His Majesty accordingly.Annex II.(No. 24.)Sir, Downing Street, January 20, 1928.I HAVE the honour to state that your despatches No. 291 of the 9th November and No. 339 of the 23rd December on the subject of the payment of compensation to Civil Servants under Article 10 of the Articles of Agreement of the 6th December, 1921, have been under the consideration of His Majesty&apos;s Government in Great Britain.2. The questions involved have required careful examination, but 1 am now able to state that His Majesty&apos;s Government in Great Britain accept the view that it would not be equitable that the transferred Civil Servants should receive more favourable treatment in the matters in question than if they had remained in the Civil Service of this country, and after fully reviewing all the circumstances they will accordingly be prepared, subject to information in greater detail as to the lines of the legislation which His Majesty&apos;s Government in the Irish Free State have in contemplation, to give their concurrence and co-operation in the general policy outlined in your despatch of the 9th November.3. One important point which will need decision relates to the question of the reimbursement of the expenditure incurred by or on behalf of the persons concerned as Plaintiffs in the case of Wigg and Cochrane versus the Attorney-General of the Irish Free State. His Majesty&apos;s Government in Great Britain would wish to commend this question to the sympathetic consideration of HisMajesty&apos;s Government in the Irish Free State.4. A further point which requires consideration is that of the most appropriate time for a public announcement. His Majesty&apos;s Government in Great Britain fully realise the desirability of such an announcement at the earliest practicable date, but they feel that misunderstandings are likely to arise if a public statement is made before the question of the action to be taken has been examined in further detail and agreed. /I have, &amp;c. (For the Secretary of State), LOVAT.
