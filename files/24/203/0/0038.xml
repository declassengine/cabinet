N^ots by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I circulate to ray colleagues the draft of a letter in which the Foreign Office suggest to the various other departments concerned the formation of a standing inter-departmental committee In order to co-ordinate British policy at inter-national conferences and particularly at the Assembly of the League of Nations.    The object and scope of the proposal are explained In the draft0    I need only say that the growing import-ance of the Assembly and the great increase in the rcomber and complexity of questions which are dealt with at International conferences render it most desirable that steps should be taken to secure a closer co-ordination of British policy than exists today o .&apos;reign Office, S,Y/Q1*

It may -happen that a number of separate Departments all take exception to different proposals which are
due for discussion by the Assembly.     Although all these proposals may be objectionable, they are so in.varying degrees, and if it should seem impolitic to maintain opposition on all pointse it might be possible to decide, after inter-Departmental discussion, to forgo opposition to some of the less unacceptable Items.     Further, any one proposal may Interest two or more Departments, whose views may not coincide, and discussion might be the easiest way of reconciling them 3.     To a less extent, a similar difficulty arises with regard to international conferences generally.     The Interests of all the Departments concerned may not be identical:   instructions which in a particular case may be reasonable may, in the light of general policy and taking into account the line followed or proposed at other conferences, appear inconsistent or undesirable: without some regular system of centralisation there is a danger that some Department,&apos; !. ultimately affected may not be consulted.4.      It has been suggested that a remedy might be found in some system co-ordinating and centralising all the work in connexion with international Conferences, and that this should be done by the institution of a Standing Inter-De part mental Committee, which might meet,, when necessary, at the Foreign Office under the 1 chair-manship of an official of this Department,, 5.      Invitations to International conferences are received in the Foreign Office and forwarded to the Departments concerned.      The latter would be asked in each case to indicate the nature of the instructions which in their view should be issued to the British Delegate., in tho event of the invitation being accepted.
On receipt of the replies, it would be decided whether to call a meeting of the Standing committee      A meeting would of course be summoned if any Department made a request to that, effect -60      In cases where there was any doubt, the Committee would decide which Department or Departments should select and settle the instructions to the British Delegates,  who should in all cases receive    their formal appointment from the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.7.     As regards the co-ordination of the instructions to the British delegation to the Assembly of the League, it Is clear that a full attendance of representatives of all departments would make the Committee unwieldy and tend to impede rather than expedite business, especially if each department were represented by more than one official0 It is Important to reduce as far as possible both the attendance and work cf the Committee and in order to achieve this it is suggested that the following procedure should be followed^     After the circulation of the Assembly Agenda it will be the duty of the Secretary, taking into account any observations which Departments may make, to consider in consultation with the Chairman which items should come before tho Conimlttee and which departments are concerned. Only representatives of-these departments will be summoned to attends      By this means not only will the labours of the Committee be restricted so far as possible but the Committee itself will be kept within manageable dimensionsa 8.      It is not intended that the proposed committee should normally deal with questions connected with the Independent Labour Organisation which will for the present continue to be dealt with by the existing Inter-departmental committee appointed foe the purpose u
