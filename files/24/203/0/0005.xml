(THIS LOOULSBT IS TH3 PRQP32TY 01? HIS ERITAimiC MA JEGTT &apos;S G0V2RM..LEHT ).. SECRET.O.P. 105(29). COPY HQ.   gfj)C A 3 I 3 B Tt EOTCATIOff POLICY. Memorandum by the President of the 3oard of Education.I have not troubleo the Cabinet with questions cf future educational policy because I thought it would be unnecessary to include any reference to them in our election programme.       I have now oome to the aonclusion, however, that we ought to give some indication of our policy on twa points,  in addition to the point relating to non-provided schools which the Cabinet has already considered.The Education A^t is based on a olassifioation of schools into &quot;elementary&quot;, containing the vast mass of tho school children of the country, and &quot;higher&quot;,  centaining a comparatively small number of selected children. Thisclassification cannot be made to fit the present accepted policy of re-organising all schools with a break at 11 years of age and a re-vision of the whole structure of the Act is becoming increasingly necessary.     Advantage can be taken of such a revision to simplify and consolidate many provisions of the Act, the drafting of which has recently been criti-cised in the Courts.       Such a revision may also greatly facilitate a settlement pf the religious difficulty.I?or the same reason, the structure of the Burnham agreement governing the salaries of teachers is out cf date and ought to be revised.      The present agreement is
terminable by cither the local authorities or the teachers1 organisations at one year1s notice,  but not earlier than March, 1931.      If either side wish to terminate it at that date, notice will, therefore, have to be given by next March and a decision to give such notice would probably have to be taken in the summer or autumn.      It seems to me most undesirable that a reconsideration of the structure of the Bur Chain agreement should be complicated by a renewal at this moment of the old business of bargaining about increases or reductions of rates of salary.        I should, therefore, like to see the existing agreement run on for the present, until proposals for a new system of classifying and grading ... teachers havo been thoroughly discussed.     This view is,  I believe,  shared by the great bulk&quot; of the teachers and I do not think that the local authorities generally wish to re-opera the salaries question at this juncture.The discussion of a revision of the Education Act should proceed concurrently with the discussion of a new Burnham Agreement, for the two problems are interdependent. To these two lines of discussion a third can be added,    if desired - a discussion of a new grant system, but this possibility can be &quot;left for further consideration,,I should like , therefore, to announce in general terms,  in our education programme at the election,  that in our view, the legislation which governs the administration of education and the  classification of schools should be brought up to date and that the principle of national settlements governing the salaries and conditions of service of teachers should be embodied in a permanent form,  in harmony with the1 new conditions.        I should like to add that, while the Government cannot interfere with the discretion of theSo
local authorities and the teaching profession, we hope that no notice will be given to terminate the existing Buirnharn agreement until the problem of a permanent settlement has been fully dlsoussed;I do not,  of course,  seek to commit the Cabinet to any details of the new legislation, still less to any decision which would involve increased expenditure or prejudice the. prospects of economy. An announcement onthe lines suggested in the preceding paragraph would leave our hands completely free in such matters and it would, moreover, diminish the danger of Parliamentary candidates being asked for specific declarations about rates of salary.Board of Education,8th April, 1929.
