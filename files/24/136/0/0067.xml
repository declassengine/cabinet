In March 1919, by authority of the war Cabinet, a copy was forward.-3d to tho Secretary of the Admiralty for issue- to tho Committee- about to proceed to Constantinople under Commodore F,H,. Mitchell, to- investigate the course of the operations and the defences in the Dardanelles, the Admiralty to be responsible for tho contents&apos; being kept secret.    With the above executions- no one has had access to the complete report, but a few witnesses who appeared before the Commission have been. pro vi ded with a copy of their own e vi d e nc e.The same procedure would . pr esumably apply to the use of the records of the Mesopotamia Commission..In 1913 for the purpose: of a chapter in &quot;The Oxford Survey of tho British Empire&quot; devoted to problems&apos; of Imperial Defence, ear tain confidential information contained in the files of the Committee . of Imperial Defence-was given to the compiler.- With regard to-the records of the War Cabinet, etc..,, the procedure governing their -use for the -purposes of the official history is shown in the following Note dated 11th May,  1921*...... v.......... .*   ( Signed ) E.YDANI3L.20.  3.    2.THE OFFICIAL HISTORY&quot; OF THE WAR.THE USE OF THE -PROCEEDINGS OF THE WAR COUNCIL AMD SIMILAR .BODIES.Note by the Secretary of the Historical Section.- On&apos; May 5th, 1921,. the Cabinet considered -a memorandum by-the Secretary to the Cabinet asking, f or their direction as to the eytent to-which the proceedings of such bodies as the War Council, Dardanelles- Committee,- VAar.
