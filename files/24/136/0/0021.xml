/[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Magestys Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.   April 1922.SECRET.CP. 3921.THE   CABINET.THE SITUATION IN PHOENICIA.I circulate a report -which the Civil Secretary for Palestine has received from the Governor of Phoenicia.w. s. c.Colonial Office,April 3, 1922.The Governorate, Haifa, Palestine, February 5, 1922.I THINK it desirable to set forth at some length the reasons for discontent and disaffection amongst the non-Jewish population of this district. I feel sure that the wild reports and alarms which occur here periodically are not merely the results of factious agitation, but do represent or reflect popular distress and anxiety. Economic conditions have, of course, a powerful influence on political sentiments, and the former especially are most unsatisfactory. The state of the peasant proprietors is substantially unchanged, but whilst no cogent grounds of disaffection are present, the villagers are no less sensitive than they were to incitements and anti-Government agitation from the towns. In these latter the non-Jewish mass of the population is thoroughly disgruntled. At Acre and Shefa Amr business is at a standstill. At Haifa nearly all trades which are profitable to the Arabs show a decline. The Customs returns of the port give no true indication of this, as their inflation is due to imports which are almost exclusively in Jewish hands. The Customs barrier with Syria is evidently killing the transit trade, which was the special preserve of local Arab (many of them ex-Syrian) merchants, who have also lost heavily on a dull cereal market. Mainly, but not entirely, through lack of capital and credit, the non-Jewish shopkeeper is being &quot;frozen out&quot; of the retail business. Even porters and other casual labour are beginning to be affected by the preference shown by Jewish firms and employers towards immigrant labour. To the loss of trade and an easily acquired livelihood are added the burden of high rents and the cost of living. These burdens fall at least as heavily on the Jews ; but whilst a relatively small number only of Arab landlords benefit from the rents, all classes of townspeople suffer from the high cost of living. And the Arab tenant, accustomed to spread himself in a house of three to five rooms, looks angrily at the immigrant Jewish family living in a single room, which they call &quot; a house.&quot; Higher up in the social scale the merchants and the effendi class are in a state of mind bordering oh despair; they find it increasingly difficult to live by the proceeds of trade or other employment; those of them who own several houses in a town live off the rents, but realise that, in a little while, Jewish building activity will deprive him of this profitable source of revenue; many of them are faced with the alternatives of bankruptcy or emigration. The case of the large landed proprietor is little better; he is heavily in debt, and can obtain no more credit; the price of cereals is low; foreign markets, for one reason or another, are practically closed to him ; he is even finding it difficult to dispose at a fair price of lands he may have to sell.To the Arab dweller in a town, his disabilities and distress appear to be the direct consequence of the present British policy and its corollary the Jewish immigration. And until, and unless, his economic condition improves, nothing loill persuade him to the contrary.Looking at the question from my (perhaps rather narrow) standpoint at Haifa, I confess that, personally, I see very little hope for the native merchant and the ellendi [8173]
class as a whole. Their opposition to the present policy, and to the Government that will execute it, is, to me, perfectly intelligible, and 1 can see no means, consistent with that policy, of overcoming it. The case of the peasants who are the mass of the population is different, and, given the necessary protection and assistance (which the British mandate should secure), there is do reason why they should not thrive in the future. The Bedouin, of course, will have either to become fellahiu or to quit the country as it becomes settled and populated.The foregoing analysis does not touch upon the question whether, even if there were no political commitments, it would be worth while to perpetuate the effendi class; but if, as I believe it to be, this analysis is substantially true, then it foilows that there can be no stable political truce, far less an alliance, between this Government and the effendis. The conflict of interests is too acute, and no sophistries about pau-Arabism or the universal benefits of economic development can make it appear otherwise. The most we can reasoimely hope to do is to mitigate by judicious concessions to their amour-propre the venom of the effendis against us. Thus, and by showing keen and practical concern for the welfare of the fellahin, we may be able to prevent the total alienation of the latter from us, and to secure the fulfilment of the present policy. This policy is anathema to the large majority including the most enlightened elements of the non-Jewish population of Palestine, and only by a wonderful combination of firmness, tact, and good luck, can we hope to execute it by pacific means.(Signed)        G. S. SYMES,Governor.
