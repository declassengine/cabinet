3&quot;r-00UMENT If, THE ^O^K OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJORITY&apos;S CrOWJOTls. C A B I y ^ T .      .- Qftp,5963. . REPORT BY GETTER Ah OFFICER 0OHMANDING- IN-GRIEF       ^JT&quot;^ ON THE SITUATION IN IRELAND FOR V.&apos;j&quot;rT*T?EEK ETIDTHO    &apos;6th MAY. 1982o &quot;I(C irculated by the Secretary of St at e for Mar.)GENERAL SITUATION.1.     During the early part of the week the situation was even more chaotic than usualcThe rebel element in the I,R,a. v/e^e raiding hanks, removing considerable amounts, capturing Motor Oars., occupying buildings both in Dublin and in the Country Districts *The Provisional Government authorities regained generally inactive.At Kilkenny on 2nd-&quot;[ay the two opposing forces cane into conflictj the Provisional Government troops were successful and slight casualties were inflicted on the rebels who were evicted from buildings they had occupied.Later in the week a more hopeful situation developed, ten prominent I.R.A;   Officials five supporters of the Provisional Government and five Republicans, issued a manifesto urging the unification of the Army, the holding of the elections without interference or intimidation, and admitting that the majority of the people were willing to accept the Treaty.Conferences are being held between the representatives of both parties,, and a truce has been agreed to from 1600 hoisr s 4th May till 1600 hours 9th May.    This has now been extended indefinitely,2, No news has been obtained of the three officers and private soldier kidnapped at Maeroom on 26th April.On 2nd ?*ay a column of troops from Cork accompanied by a leading local official of the -I ,R . A-. - Piad 3 investigations in the neighbourhood without&apos; result, this action the Irish Press termed   provocative&quot; in its usual desire to inflame unruly passions against the Government.Efforts to discover trace of these British soldiers is now being carried out by the leaders of both parties of the I.R.A.. who assure me,  and I think in good faith, that they know nothing of the incident.    This may be true as there are armed-bands in existence who admit allegiance to no party.     . On the other hand it is difficult to believe that the Republican garrison of -acroom can be entirely ignorant.3,     In order to embarrass certain operations whioh were being undertaken by the Provisional Government, -the Republicans exit all railway lines in County Tipperary in several places, and prevented, by force all attempts at repair-,A passenger train to which a military ambulance coach   -(containing 4 lying and 6 sitting military cases) was cut off between two of these breaks in the line on afternoon of 1st May.    The train returned to Thurles where it remained for night 1/2 May,On morning 2nd May a column of ambulances with escort of  -troops and armoured, cars left the Curragh to b -ing in the occupants of the ambulance coach. &apos; The provisional Government troops at towns en route gave every assistance to the column,giving ......
giving information&apos; as to roads that were-impas s able, etc; The column&apos;,arrived-at Thurles on.afternoon to find that the ambulance coach had. &quot;been detached from the-. train and had been permitted to proceed alone with engine to Dublin via Nenagn.., The inhabitants of Thurles expressSQd themselves delighted at seeing British troops again and provided the men with tea,, The column arrived safely--back at the Curragh at 0600 hours on 3rd May,4.     In Dublin on night 1/2 May the Republicans seized further buildings:- ...TaLDARE STREET CLUB.BALLAST BUILDINGS &apos;LEVER BUILDINGSAs it was known that certain British officers were in this Club I informed the Provisional Government that if they were not set at liberty in an hour I should be obliged to take action myself.   Thereupon the Provisional Government troops surrounded the Ktldare Street Club and came to an agreement with the leader of the Republican garrison, by which the Club was to be evacuated by 0700 hours on 2nd May, and the officers referred to were released.The Provisional Government troops withdrew early on -morning Of 2nd May; the Repxiblicans are still in occupation.BALLAST Buildings&apos; and LEVER Buildings command the approaches to the OcConnell and Grattan Bridges respectively on the Southern side.   The.Ballast Buildings have now been partially evacuated, evidently owing to pressure by the Laboir, Party.Two military motor vehicles, one of them an ambulance, ha^e been held up, and removed by Republicans.   The latter is understood to be now in possession of the Provisional Government-Forces who have promised to restore it.5.     The-situation in BELFAST has been quiet, this I largely attribute- to- the. withdrawal of the &quot;0&quot; Special Constabulary from duty In the- street at the. request of General Cameron.In the country districts attacks have been made by I,R.A. forces on Police Barracks and on a patrol of &quot;B&quot; Special Constabulary as follows:-On 2nd May, BELLAGHY Police Barracks&apos; attacked - 1 constable killed, 1 sergeant 1 constable wounded.   2 of the attackers were captured.On 4th May, BALLYCONAN Barracks attacked - 1 constable killed, 1 sergeant 2 constables wounded;6.     On 1st May a :number of English M&quot;*T-idrivers of the,R. 1.0. at GORMANSTOWN, enraged at the murder of one of their number by Republicans on 30th April, broke out of camp and proceeded to DROGHEDA, whei*e they burnt De Valera&apos;s election Offices and fired into an hotel) on the way back to 0ORMANST0WN they burnt the cottage near which their comrade was murdered. It is understood that they recaptured their car which had been taken by the Republicans and considerably frightened the Republican Garrison of Erogheda Barracks *   In this connection I again wish to emphasize the danger of having several thousands of R.I.C personnel with nothing to do waiting far so long for disbandmentv7.     A new methad of Impressing&apos;the Belfast Boycott is inoperation in Dublin,-Influential Protestants are totake In.and feed:so-called Roman Catholic refugees from Belfast&apos; The MASONIC:flail in Molesworth Street has also been taken over OstensIbly, for this, purpose,(Signed) C.F,N.MACREADY* GeneralG,H.-,.&apos;:, Ireland,. .
