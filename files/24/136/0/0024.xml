Ho. 182 on its receipt ana have since discussed with their.,- liCth individually and together, at great length the xmJiHOi, nte 1 issue regarding the I/ten date.      I have not yet succeeded in finding a solution.That both of them are completely staunch to the principle of exclusive relations and treaty with Great Britain is altogether- beyond question;     and the hint that we might abandon Iraq and evacuate is regarded by them with dismay. They oannot however, oonceive it possible.The Naqib oannot visualise things from the point of view of Eis Ma,jeJgtyTs Government nor can he really appreciate their difficulty from international point of view*     He says that if we wish it he is quite prepared to retire from the scene, but for the sake of his good name now and with posterity he is not prepared to. sign a treaty in which parties are In a position of Mandatory and Mandated State - a position which he regards as Inobmpatible with Maude&quot;s Proclamation that we came to Iraq in the role of liberators.The King has a better appreciation of the real&apos; difficulties of His Majestyfs Government but feels that if he accepted the above relationship in a Treaty his failure ?jould- 1 -
&quot;bo certain.     He is convinced that the Constituent Assembly would repudiate both hire end the Treaty.On the above I have to comment as follows The origin of their objections is much more the sinister meaning attached to the hated word and theory of &apos;* mandate&quot; than any fear that our control may ;.rove too strict in practice and that we should come to a rupture or a deadlock over a mere question of terminology or that we should fail to find a formula, would be deplorable I beg your assistance in the search.    Is (Tit) not conceivable that in consultation between Allies and League of Nations the name and theory of &quot;mandate&quot; could be modified in the caso of Syria., Tales tine and Mesopotamia alike?     so that in the last paragraph of Preamble of cur Treaty we might say something like this: Begins :-&quot;They have in exercise thereof become satisfied that, in the case of certain states, designation and theory of TMandate&apos; and lMa:idated State 1  as contemplated at Peace Conference have no^ become inappropriate and consider that position of Great Britain towards Iraq may henceforth be regarded as that of holder of a trust from League of Hations to induce Iraq Government to establish and develop oountry on lines which while ensuring performance of Iraq&apos;s recognised obligations to Great Britain shall., be in best interests of the People of Iraq and of civilisation.    It is further considered that these relations can for the future better be defined by a Treaty of Alliance than by any other means and it has been agreed as follows:&apos;1    ;.Snds.&apos;  COX. 7h i te ha] 1 Gar d m s, S.
