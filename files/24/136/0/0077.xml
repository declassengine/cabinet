The failure of the, rorresentat&amp;vea of.the ProvisionalSo79rmerit and Re publicans to come to ahy: form, of .settlement at the conference held in DUBS IK- lastw-ae-ic-&apos;haS come as a . . surprise and a disappointment to a large majority, of the people, though thara ware many who believed that any settlement reached would ,only have been a temporary one ^ and. based on the ultimata intention to. overthrow the Sre-a Stata and proclaim a Republic.Though there has baen no official termination to the &quot;truce&quot; there has been a large increase to the number of outrages taking place, nflt that - the re was a cessation of these outrages during the &quot;truce&quot;.   Those outrages include roids on bonks,, trains, private houses/whoa ttha owners have been given a fow minutes notice to leave, silver pi.:to, money,; valuables, etc., being seizedthe buildings either burnt, or occupied by tho raiders..    In the towns cases have occurred of business premises being burnt.There has also been an increase in the number of cases of eviction and incendiarism due more to agrarian than political reasons, though -tha victims in most cases have been, loyalists and Protestants,     Other Protestants have received, notice to - leave the country.The prospects if tha elections being held ne:-:t month do not appear to bo universally go id. -   At a recent -.aeeting of the C:rk County Council it was decided by 14 votes to 12 votes... to take no -action in preparation for the elections until the register had boon revised.A further indication of the manner in which the Republican Party mean to treat all attempts at an election may be gathered from the &quot;fact that,- whereas the Pro-Treaty party has&quot;decided to &quot;contest every seat, as yet the Republicans have selected, hardly any candidates. ..2. Bp further:, reliable, information has been received fromany source regarding the 3. jf ficars and one private soldier who were kidnapped at MaCROOM at the end of last month.3. In DUBLIN- no &quot;further buildings have been taken overi      by the Republicans though raids for money and cars hsva recommenced since the&apos; announcement of the failure of the Conference to come to an agreement.Sovsral cases have occurred of soldiers wearing bandolierequipment being held up by armed men and deprived of their equipment-     On night of 12/13 May, Gunner I..H.J. Rolf a (aged 21 years) was&apos;shot in one of the main thoroughfares after having been, deprived of his bandolier;    he has since died.,    his assailants&quot; were recognised as belonging&apos; to the Republican forces occupying the FOUR COURTS *   This fact
was brought, out ot tho inquest, at which a verdict of murder was no t brought ;;in. .  - I. have e ommun ic a ted wi th 0 hairman.

The casualties for  trie week (6th - 13th May) being:-KILLED *WOUNDED,PROTESTANTS Roman CATHOLICS POLIOS ARMY ,&apos;,,&apos;&apos;1 110. .9.:l.TOTAL.20-  The sequence of these/outrages is interesting.    On 1.2th May a tram conductor (Protestant) was killed by a bomb placed in his tram.    This led&apos; to an outbreak&apos;of shooting which caused the death of a man called Cullen (a Catholic)?. . -   &apos;Early, on the morning of the 13th a &quot;Protestant on his .way -to work was. shot andv-severoly- wounded, -and shortly afterwards a Postman (Protestant and ex-soldiar)&quot; going- his .rounds was murdered.5.   -        .   In Northern I ro-1 and - the&apos; If R .1.. &apos;-&apos;f^ro&apos;e s nave been less active, there being only one attack .on a Police Barrack (PORE HILL, Co. ARMAGH) on 10th &quot;May, there were -no--casualties.6. On 12th May the -tireless and Coastguard Station atBUNBEC (Coo DONEGAL) was-burnt by the- T,R*A* garrison, the damage according to the .press reports is estimated at  30:000.     The station was handed over to the representatives of the Provisional Government,some months-ago, who piaced a detachment of troops there, theso apparently later joined the Republicans-.7. The final evacuation of the CURRAGH will -be completed on16th May. when the 14th Infantry Brigade will be concentrated in DUBLIN, its four battalions &quot;-,2nd Royal Welsh.Pu3iliers, 1st Leicester Regt&apos;., 1st Northampton Rogt. and the 2nd Loyal Regt. being encamped, in PHOENIX PARK.8. , The final evacuation of CORX and QUEENS TOWN will becompleted by 18th May when the 17th.Infantry Brigade will be - -transferred to - ULSTER.    The. evacuation of YOUGHAL and BALLINCOLLIG is already in engross.h The Provisional Government, . I am informed, have sentrepresentatives to take over the &quot;barracks in Co. CO.BK*9* As can doubtless be ..understood the opportunities. fortraining are very limited:-both. on account of lack, of training facilities now and small numbers &quot;available for-guards and other military duties. V:
It has however been possible in tho 6th Division-for &apos; a company to fi.ro its musketry oourse at YOTOHAl&quot;, while eight Companies, and&apos; parties of recruits are continuously doing thoir musketry in Ulate r Distr ict.In Dublin District as &quot;all classification ranges have been handed over to the provisional Government, no musketry except on 30 yards ranges can bo carried out,    It is however hoped to exorcise all mon in a condonsod course of platoon and section training by tho end of June,(Signed)     OmFvS-MAC HEADYiGeneral, Command!ag-in-Phlef..
