NOTES ON GLAUSES. Clauses 4 and 5.Forfeiture of relative seniority for purposes of promotion involves at present no real penalty on officers whose promotion depends on length of service. These clauses remedy this anomaly, and at the same time confer power on the Army Council to restore both relative seniority and forfeited service in proper cases.Clause 6.The object of this clause is to enable boys under 18 to be enlisted as boy artificers or for special technical branches of the service in such a way that service before they attain the age of 18 will be in the nature of appren-apprenticeship, and that their 12 years&apos; enlistment will only count as from the time when they attain the age of 18.Clause 7.This clause will have in the case of the Air Force a similar effect to that of clause 6 in the case of the Army. The difference is that all enlistments in the air force are for service of a special technical character, and the service of all boys so enlisted will be in the nature of apprenticeship until they attain the age of eighteen.Clause 8.This clause removes doubts which have been raised as to the power of retaining soldiers in colour service for a year, if, at the time when they would otherwise be transferred to the reserve, they are serving overseas.It also makes clear that a soldier at the end of his colour service need not be sent home and transferred to the reserve if at that time a Proclamation calling out the reserve is in force.94-2a
Clause 9.Section 190 (8) of the Army Act contains the definition of the expressions &quot; regular forces &quot; and &quot; His Majesty&apos;s regular forces &quot; as used in that Act. The expressions are there defined as meaning &quot; officers and soldiers who by their &quot; commission, terms of enlistment, or otherwise are liable &quot; to render continuously for a term military service to His &quot; Majesty in any part of the world.&quot; This clause removes a doubt which has arisen as to whether officers and soldiers may be commissioned or enlisted in the regular forces for service in a particular area, as well as generally for service all over the world.
