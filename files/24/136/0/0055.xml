IlkEXPLANATORY MOTS BY LORD.JKHUTSFORD,On Thursday, 50th March, I am going to move the second Reading of a Bill to amend the Places of Worship (Enfranchisement) Act.In 1920 this Act passed through both Houses without opposition.Very briefly, this Act enabled Trustees of Leasehold premises used as Places of Worship to turn their Leaseholds into Freeholds upon compensation to the Landlord for the cost of the land.The only exception made was ivhere the premises had been acquired by certain specified public bodies, or by the owners, for the purposes of a Railway Dock, or Canal, or Navigation, under an Act of Parliament.     Such premises could not he enfranchised.My amendment is merely for the purpose of extending this exception to premises owned by a Charity, provided, that the Charity can/prove to the^satisfaction of the Charity Commissioners or Board&quot; of - Fduoation&quot; that^such pVemises are&quot;needed f or&quot;&quot;tEe&quot;&quot;extenaion oT&apos; the work of &quot;such Charity.It Yfas never Intended by the promoters of the Act of 1920 that the Trustees of c%h? Charity should by this Act be put into the position of damaging; the prospects, or work, of another Charity.(Sgd)    KNUTSFORD.London. Hospital, .   March, 1922.An actual example how this Aot can harm a Charity.     If my amendment is passed such harm could never occur again.100 years ago the Governors of the London Hospital, who own a small Estate round the Hospital, let to the Wesleyans a Site for a Chapel and a Burial Ground,     Fotirteen years ago the Wesleyans sold the remaining years of their Lease to the Trustees of a Jewish Synagogue, who subsequently applied to the Hospital for an extension,- and. were told that it was quite impossible, as the land was urgently needed by the Hospital, there being no other site in the whole of Whiteohapel.Suddenly this 1920 Act was passed, and the Jewish Body have the right now to take the Chapel and Burial Ground from the Hospital in spite of tha fact that they were told when they purchased the few remaining years of the Wesleyan Lease that the Hospital needed the land for the extension of its own work.If the Act had been In existence when the Wesleyans sold the rest of their Lease to the Jews they would have had to give the Hospital the first offer before parting with the Lease.

COPY OF LETTER RECEIVED FROM THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL.

27th April, 1922.

Dear Mr. Wicks,

Lord Knutsford has been to see me this morning to ascertain whether it would be possible for the Government to take up "the Places of Worship Enfranchisement-Amendment Bill" which he has got passed through the House of Lords. He has secured a large measure of agreement for the Bill in the House of Commons; the Labour Party will not oppose it and the Welsh Party, who were at the back of the original Bill passed in 1920, assent to it.

I should like to get the Bill passed, for I think it stops a rather serious gap in the Bill of 1920.

Will you please bring the matter to the attention of Mr. Fisher, and ask if he will allow the matter to be put upon the Agenda for consideration by the Home Affairs Committee?

And believe me, etc.

(Sgd) ERNEST M. POLLOCK.
