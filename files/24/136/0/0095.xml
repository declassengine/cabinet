THIS PQOUMBMT IS THE. PROPERTY OP -HIS BRIT-MMIO MA JEST V S GOWBMMl^,GAB 1, NE T,fTHE ROYAL POOCTAHD^,AND, OTHER INDUSTRIAL ^EggABL.tSEMEM.ES   ffHJkf .. THE  ^ADMIRALTY t -PROPCfeE3) WAfiES.PEpUOJIOKS.SECBE.T3994. &apos; Memorandum by; the Minister of Labour.-I have read the Memorandum by the First Lord of the Admiralty (CP,3980) about the recent agreement in the Shipbuilding Industry for a, reduction of wages and its effect upon the position in the Royal Dockyards.The Amalgamated Engineering Union is not a party to this agree-ment and, until an agreement is made by the Engineering and National Employers&quot; federation with that Union, the members of that Union whether employed in the Shipbuilding or in the Engineering Tradeswill as a result not suffer the reduction.The oustom of shipbuilding firms (who are usually members of both the Shipbuilding Employers&apos; Federation and the Engineering and national Employers&apos; Federations) except in tho case of the smaller firms who have no engine shops, is to regulate the wages of their engineering craftsmen, such as engine fitters, ooppersmiths, and other trades embraced by the A.E.U., in accordance with the practice of the engineering trade in the district.     At Southampton in respect of all engineering craftsmen and in certain other districts in respect of coppersmiths it is the established practice for the wages of these workers to follow shipbuilding wage movements and to this extent the shipbuilding reduction is already operative In the case of members of the A.S.U.   It appears however, to be impossible to base a decision on this isolated case. .The Shipbuilding Employers&apos; Federation recognise that until the general engineering trade effects a reduction of wages, the
relation &quot;between the wages paid to   members of the A.B.U. and other craft unions vitfiich existed as a result of the practice of paying uniform increases of wages in both industries, will be considerably disturbed, and that serious anomalies may result.     For example, in many yards engine fitters will continue to receive their present wage rates while their labourers will suffer a reduction of 16/6d. They feel, however, that it is necessary to maintain the established practice by which their members regulate wages of some craftsmen in accordance with the wage movements in the engineering trade.The practice of the Admiralty during the War and since has been t\sf    put into operation general increases .or reductions of the wages of all classes of workpeople simultaneously and until the present time the wages in both the Shipbuilding and Engineering Trades have moved pjari p.assumed.-      Reductions in the Engineering Trade are in the air but have been delayed by the lock-out.The administrative dilemma in which the Admiralty find them-selves. as a result of the present divergence of wages between the engineering and shipbuilding trades is shared by the private ship-building employers in whose case, however, the present anomalies arise out of recognised practice.     The organisation in the Admiralty jrards is different from that in the private yards and it may well be that a sudden and marked disturbance of the long established relation-ship between the wages of different classes of workers, e.g. shipwrights and fitters, might effect the spirit of the men in the yards with results adverse to production.If, for the sake of administrative convenience, the Admiralty put into effect an equal reduction for all classes of workpeople, employed in the dockyards, the A.S.U. would have ground for complaint that this action by a Government Department prejudiced the position of their ( members in respect of forthcoming wage negotiations in the engineering industry.
r -    583/Ci, If the Admiralty put into operation a general reduction forall men employed in the dockyards of &amp; lesger amount than that accepted in the shipbuilding industry, they would be dpen to criticism.,that the Government is incurring, at the expense of the taxpayer, higher rates of wages in the dockyards than are paid in private yards.    They would also be open to criticism hy the Bngineering Employers&apos; Federation who might urge that the acceptance by a -Government Department pf ft lees reduction -than 16/6d. for members of the A.E.U. preJudioeA   the   position of the Engineering employers in the forthcoming wage negotiations.^        It is not possible to say definitely at this stage at what date wage negotiations in the engineering trade will begin and will be completed or on what figure a settlement is likely.     It may be that after the disturbance caused by the dispute on managerial functions the employers may decide to wait two or three months before, effecting a reduction in wages.      If the Admiralty made no reduction in the meantime in the case of any of their workpeople in the dook-yards it would be difficult to justify suoh a situation to the tax-payer, especially in view not only of the reduction of 16/6d in the shipbuilding industry, but also of the reductions in other trades of substantial amounts.Assuming thet, from a financial point of view, it is impossible to await a settlement in the Engineering Trade, and as any course of action is open to serious criticism, the oourse which oan be most easily defended should be chosen.The whole situation should be discussed in all its hearings at the Shipbuilding Trade Joint Industrial Council the objective to be reached being the adjustment of Admiralty wages to outside &apos; conditions.((Sgd) T.J.
