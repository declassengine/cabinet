like the total amount of claims that have been made all over the country, but is an indication of the vast amount which will eventually be claimed If the Statute is not amended.oWe attach herewith a suggested Bill, together with an explanatory memorandum.     The Bill has been drafted by the legal representatives of the interests involved, and, for the information of the Cabinet, we are in a position to state that the injnstioe caused by the Act is felt, not only be a very large and important section Cf the community generally,&quot;but by a very large majority of the Members of the Kcuse of Commons.We strcngly urge that the Government should either introduce into the House of Commons a Bill on the lines suggested.,., or, preferably, undertake that any such Bill, after its nassage through the House of Lords, shall be adopted by the Government in the House of Commons,(Sgd) CHARL33S A,McCURDY.(Sgd) LESLIE WILSON.29th March,. 1922.     -2 enclesures^1,    Statement of Claims for repayment of bets ) notpaid by. cheque.. ) repT,oduc2,   Draft of a Bill to amend Section.2 of the Ci.v.uLng Act of 1835, together with an explanatory memorandum,
MEMO RAW IJUK.The object of this Eill is to remove the right to recover money paid by cheque or bill in discharge of a gaming or honour debt, which it would not have been possible to recover had the money been paid in cash.There is nothing in the Bill to legalise or render recoverable a gaming debt or to facilitate gambling save that if the debt is paid by bill or cheque then the Bill prevents the drawer or his personal representative or trustee in bankruptcy, by taking proceedings within six years, from recovering the money actually paid.The judgment in Butters v. Briggs. Times Newspaper 26th October, 1921, sSofts thaiTl^Ispouse of   lords&apos; considered that if the effect of section two of the Act of 1835 had been appreciated it would have been&quot;repealed by the Act of 1845, which by section eighteen made void all gaming contracts and prohibited&apos;actions to recover wagers.Accordingly it is proposed that the repeal of section two of the Act of 1885 (which enables the drawer if he pays the holder for the time being of the cheque or bill to recover the money from the original holder) should take effect as if contained in the Act of 1840 *It is however recognised that the repeal must not be retrospective in all respects.     Thus money recovered before the Bill comes into force must be irrecoverable.     Past orders made as to cos .,s must stand, for the Plaintiff was legally correct when he commenced proceedings. - Further, for the same reason, the. Court, must be given power to award a plaintiff his costs even though the Bill intervenes and prevents his action from being successful .     There is however no reason why, if tho Plaintiff has not actually recovered his money before the Bill is passed, he should be able to do so thereafter.It-is not of course proposed to interfere with section one of the Act of 1835, which prevents the person, to whom the bill or checue is given in discharge of a wager, from suing on it.   &apos; All the Bill&apos; seeks - to do is to confirm the payment if the bill or cheoue is actually &quot;honouredso that the original holder will not be liable to refund&apos;..
