In coal-mining the position is good in some areas and, generally, men are being absorbed. In iron and steel there is, on the whole, a slight improvement. In shipbuilding and ship-repairing the future prospects are bad, but the amount of repairing work available, although small, shows some improvement. The effect of the lock-out on the engineering industry is not uniform, and in some areas is far less serious than was anticipated. The slight improvement in the motor engineering section is maintained, Improvement in the cotton trade is again reported, although it does not, as yet, indicate an early general return to full-time work. The woollen industry continues to show improvement, and in the jute trade discharges are decreasing, and there is considerably more work on hand. Hosiery is also improving, and there is some indication of a revival in two branches of the lace trade. There is no marked improvement in the boot and shoe industry, but a general revival in the clothing and making-up trades is indicated. Building is slowly improving, and the demand for plasterers, painters and decorators is good, but trades concerned with building supplies are generally slack. There is an indication of some temporary renewal of activity at the docks, although this is by no means general. The reduction in Government establishments is shown in heavy discharges throughout the South of England.T. J. MACNAMARA,Ministry of LabourNOTE.-No Report was published for week ended March 24,1922.

[From Autumn 1920 to Autumn 1921.]Cabinet Unemployment Committee.The prospect of a severe trade depression first became evident in the early autumn of 1920. On the 13th August, 1920, there was a special discussion at a meeting of the Cabinet, when the Cabinet Unemployment Committee was appointed to consider the whole question and devise means for relieving unemployment.(A.) Unemployment Insurance.An Unemployment Insurance Bill of general scope was passed into law on the 9th August, 1920, and came into operation on the 8th November following. The Act applied compulsory insurance against unemployment to 12,000,000 persons as compared with 4,000,000 previously. Subsequent amending Acts modified the conditions as regards rates of benefit and the amount thereof which could be drawn. Contributions were also increased and authority given to borrow money from the Treasury up to  20,000,000.Table showing amount paid out in Unemployment Benefit and the contributions during the period November 8, 1920, to March 11, 1922.

176 A(B.) Emergency Works and other Measures.A full statement of the measures taken in the autumn of 1920 and of the later measures from autumn 1921 onwards has been set out in previous issues of this Report. At least 250,000 men have had employment on these schemes at various times, and at the present time over 139,000 men are employed, exclusive of the work provided for men in ancillary occupations and the effect of the Export Credits and Trade Facilities Act schemes (see table below).SUMMARY SHOWING THE LABOUR EMPLOYED AT MARCH 24, 1922, ON CERTAIN OF THE SCHEMES REFERRED TO ABOVE.&apos; Scheme.
