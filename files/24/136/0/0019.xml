ERSBAS ?TLEiviElTT,L The Committee had under consideration thefollowing namoranda relative to the question of OverseasSettlementT*emo. bv the Vice Chairman, Overseas Settlement Department,  (S.0,1.)note by the Secretary to the Committee.covering Memorandum by the Treasury. (S.0v2,)Copy of Paraphrase Telegram from theGovernor-General of&quot;Australia to the Secretary of State for the Colonies ,, (S.0 ,3 ,)THE CHANCELLOR OF THE KXCHEQ.UER   stated that theimmediate question appeared to relate to the Draft Bill,copies of ^-hich were attached to the memorandum by theSecretary of State Cor the Colonies (CP.,3582), As aresult of the Dominion Conference in the Summer of 1921it had been agreed that HJU. Government should make amaximum contribution of  2 millions a year for a periodof 5 years,        -half the money being devoted to &quot;Assisted...Passages   and the other half to making loans to settlorsup to a maximum of  300 per head,    The vrhole arrangementbeing conditional on the Dominions finding contributions of like amount;.     Australia had, however, put forward amuch more ambitious proposal, involving the raising of loans up to  50 millions, the British Government beingresponsible for half the interest on the loans payableat five yearsoThis latter proposal was open to very serious objections.-, . ,%s        (Mr. Amery)THE CHAIRMAN-OF TEE OVERSEA.   SETTLsfelHT COM IT TEE/remarked that there was.no question Of any British guarantee of the principal or int,.v    r; 0f the Australian loans.Australia merely wished thb British Government to make a contribution equivalent      &quot;days.lt the Interest frur       f five years on money actually expended.   It v/as not impossible that the half/
might be reduced to one-third.     The Australian scheme however required further examination, and the real point at issue r&apos;8 3    -hether the Government should maintain the maximum of  2 millions per annum, or increase that amount substantially so       to enable the Oversea    Settlement Committee to negotiate nith the Dominions, andjif necessary to enter into future commitments of a la.eS limited character than had &quot;been contemplated at the Dominion Conference.     rhen the principle had once been approved it would be     possible for the Committee to go into details rith the Dominions end the Treasury; which -ould in any case have to sanction each individual scheme0He personally was convinced that Oversea Settlement was the best cure for the industrial situationj. and for thn serious overcrowding in this country,    Rut it was essential that any scheme adopted to meet these evils must bo on broad lines, and designed to cover a substantial period of &quot;rears.,   ?&apos;itb a vie- to being in a position to negotiate ouccossfullv vsith-Australia. Canada and tho other Dominions, he wished a. maximum provision of  5 millions per annum inserted in the Bill, but it was not his intentic that  -&apos;oro than P2 millions nor annum should be actually expended in each of tho next two   years. far.&quot;mery pointed out the advance.nta.--es from the financial point of view of using money to settle the unemployed, rather than in the grant of doles,      It should be remembered that the percentage of failures was very small,T?-r. C!14.FCi;LL0R OF THE EXCHEQUER informed the Committee that he had. always been favourable to schemes of Bmpire Settlement on the ground that by so doing ve should promote the security of the Empire, ensure larger mar-cei-s for British, goods, and. meet to some extent the seriousquestion/-2-
question of unemployment at home0     He thought that the unemployment situation mifbt veil be unsatisfactory for many years to come., and if th--? schemes in contemplation provided an immediate remedy, be thought there was much to be said for entering upon a large and active policy of Oversea    Settlement-     The great difficulty, however, was to find the money.   Tho next few years were goinr to be much more difficult for the Chancellor of the Exchequer even than the present year, and he sas most reluctant tc add to the burdens of those years0   He   as quite prepared to agre- to the terms of the Bill except as regards the  5 millions mentioned in Clause 3(c), but he thought that there .&apos;&apos;ere serious Parliamentary objections to any increase of the S.2 millions to ^hich the Government ^are already committed *Some discussion then took place as to the form of the financial resolution anc! tho actual nature of the financial provisions to te inserted in the Bill.The Committee agreed to   recommend, to the cabinetto approve the proposed Draft Settlement Bill, subject to- th3 f o 11 o ? nr mod ficetions(1)    The insertion in the Bill of a provision to ensure that the liability of the British . Exchequer was limited to a period of 15 years;(2)    The deletion of sub-clause(c) of clause 3 of the Draft Bill- and the addition to clause 4 of the Bill of - a proviso to the following effect the agreed &quot;amount advanced or expended by the Secretary of State under any scheme or schemes shall not exceed .fli millions In the financial year 1922-23, and  3 million,, in any sub-sequent financial year.The Committee also agreed:-(i)   That the Chairman of the oversea settlement Committee should, inform - Mr * hughes that doubts hoc! been ex-pressed as to the possibility of the ,Australian -Commonwealth Government
