,L, 370flTHIS DOCUMBNT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S GOVERNMENT. secretary.CP.3962. ACQUISITION OF PR IV AT ELY- OWNED WAGONS. ^- memorandum by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Transport.The Cabinet will remember that Section 13 (1) of the Ministry of Transport Act, 1919, confers upon the Minister of Transport power to purchase privately-ownod railway wagons.     This power was deemed to be most Important when obtained as upon its exercise economies on a very large scale would be effected.     Owing to the financial position subsequent to the passing of the Ministry of Transport Act this power was not exercised and the enactment of the Rail-ways Act, 1921, has altered the position.     In any case in the present financial conditions I do not contemplate that the exercise of this power will be practicable, as a sum of possibly betxveen 35 and 40 million pounds sterling would be required.     Further, I think that the advantages which would accrue from the abolition of privately-owned wagons can progressively be secured, when the time Is ripe, * by prohibiting further construction of such wagons at some future date under the power conferred by Sub-section 5 of Section 13 of the Ministry of Transport Act.I have received from a leading representative of private wagon builders a letter enquiring whether the power to purchase privately-owned wagons still exists or whether it is likely to be abolished.     The letter states that the trade as a whole are satisfied that this power has handl-capped the purchase and manufacture of wagons.I am not satisfied that any restriction of the purchase and manufacture of railway wagons which may have taken place can reasonably be attributed to the possession

The main causes of any such restriction are, I believe, the general condition of trade at the present time and the un-certainty which existed as to the future of the coal-mining industry.     I consider, however, that an authoritative statement should be made that it is not the intention of the present Government to exercise the power of acquisition con-tained in the Ministry of Transport Act, and I ask for the authority of the Cabinet to make this statement.(Sd.)    ARTHUR NEAL.I endorse the foregoing.(Sd.) CRAFFORD AMD BALCARRES.
