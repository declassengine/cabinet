Efforts are also being made to prooure an adverse ballot.Mass Picketing is maintained but the only disorder reported occurred at Langley on May 19th when about 700 men attempted to reach Messrs. Hughes Johnson&apos;8 works.On May 15th the wholly unemployed on the live registers ftotalled approximately 1,553s500, a decrease of 33*625 on the I previous week:   short time workers on the same date numberedapproximately 130,000. J1Communists are trying to work up agitation among the unemployed against the present system of unemployment benefit.On May 17th about 1,500 organised unemployed came into collision with the Birmingham police, who made a baton charge.Extreme shortage of funds has forced the Communist P&amp;rty to reduce its paid staff to a mini urn.The Young Communist League has received money from the   Berlin J Bureau of the Young Communist International.Extracts are given from the &quot;Resolutions and Theses of the Second Congress of the Young Coroivninist International &quot;:   these indicate the seditious netme of the organisation^
TEE ENGINEERS .It seems probable that extremists will try to proiaire an adverse rote in the forthcoming ballot of the 47 unions: their efforts to extend the dispute hare been divided between &amp;     the non-federated shops and the pub11o utility eerrioee.Tom Mannfs views on the situation are set but in a eon-fidential document whloh has come into my possession: \&quot;It would have been awkward for me to have encouragl ed the men to have; oome; out of the non fed. shops at the.&apos; moment - as here in London bartioularly we are much con-: &apos;   cerned to get them out of; the 79, ?ower Houses. affeo*iag swwage^ water, gas and eleotrio light and power and f* oan11 get these out unless they are palled out by the Executive Committees this is due to blunders made on &quot;Jimi lar job during the Miners1 strike:., the, Eleotrioal 9rl4dV Union men are really good on Fight policy, but are ve/yy anxious the Exeoutive Comtidttees shall draw out the nben and so make it successful, and they believe it will /borne off by the polloy being pursued - ana they believe it would not oome off if at the same time we pulled out the non feas and so as not to have divided action I am suppor ing their policy.     If it pans out the Executive Committee wont. then etc. (?)   Things iare going well here, BpiritUf men good, more sturdy (?) than ever, no signs of funk, \ I good educational work going^on.&quot; A f&apos; The Chief Constable of Birmingham informs mo that oil May A17th a oonxerenoe of trade. unions, and, the Central Lock-outCommittee passed a resolution calling upon their Executives tobring out men employed in non-federated firms and in all publicutility services.It is reported that a similar resolution was passed by asfa&amp;a meeting of Sheffield engineers on May 14tfc.Ihe. Executive o  the National Administrative Counoil of   ] Unemployed recently considered a plan for the organisation of ,- : unemployed;in groups?   the ohief object of these groups is toI --        cause/    ffi
cause confusion in demonstrations as the organisers are of opinion that if sections of about 50 men, under the control, of a leader, break away from the main processions at given points, control by polioe will be rendered difficult:   the present intention is to try this scheme in London within the next week or so and it is hopeay in the words of the Camber-well secretary, that &quot;as many windows as possible will &quot;be broken&quot;.....It is reported that arrangements are being made for a demonstration of unemployed to visit the Minister of Health on May 29 h&apos;v Extremists say that they expect a conflict with the Police and will go suitably prepared as they are deter-mined to get within the precinots of Parliament, if it he sitting or not:   it is added that certain sections of the main body have been told that as soon as the Polioe form a cordon in Whitehall they are to break away and reach the rendes-vous through the side streets.The Chief Constable,of Birmingham. informs me that on May 17th a crowd of some 1,500 organised unemployed attempted to demonstrate before the Guardians1 Offices:   they were stop-ped by a oordon of police- but threw showers of stone chip-pings, which had been collected for road mending, at the polios a baton charge was made, but no one was; injured;.The Chief Constable of Plymouth informs me. that some of the local unerap loyed, inspired by  bury are marching in pro-cession to various works to ask for employment:   about 400 visited Messrs.Coles but their request that each man1e paper should be signed with a statement that no work was available was refused.   ; The men think that if they can get these statements, the present policy of the Labour Exchanges may be altered. , -,&quot;)
*m   3   wiTHE COMMUNISTSThe headquarters of the Communist Party appear to be ap-proaching bankruptcy arid It is possibly significant that theannouncement of this fact more or less synchronized with theknowledge that no loan should be granted to Soviet Russia:   onMay 16th the acting secretary sent the following communication to all divisional organisers:&quot;At the Executive meeting held last week-end eon-Bide ration was given to the report and recommendations of the Commission which had reoently &quot;been appointed to deal . .     with the reorganisation of the Party,    Among the recommendation-v&apos; &quot;   mendations accepted careful consideration was given to the proposal that the financial responsibility for divisional organisers should &quot;be removed from the Executive Committee and placed upon the divisions, and with great regret I have to Inform you that it has &quot;been found necessary to dispense with the paid services of all divisional organisers&quot;You can &quot;be sure that such a serious step would not have been t aken except for the most urgent reasons and no reflection Is cast upon yourself in consequence.   The Committee indeed wish me to acquaint you with their ap-preoiation of your services whilst you have held your present position.   The Committee is confident, however, that you will do your utmost to make such arrangements that will permit of the continuation of the present work being done by you, and I should he glad to hear from you at the earliest possible moment what steps have &quot;been taken in this direction.&quot;Prom this date therefore it is proposed that the salary for the position held &quot;by you shall oease at the end of three weeks.   During this period you will of course continue your duties as heretofore.&quot;Further light was thrown on the position by a communication sent by the acting national organiser to Robert Stewart on the same day:WI can assure you this last week-end has been a very worrying time indeed and you will be Interested to know that the Exeoutive Committee, acting upon the recommenda-tions of the Commission in accordance with the flnanoial position, have decided that in-a few short days the paid list of the Party shall conform to its dues-paying capaei-ty... You will understand what I mean when I say that the financial problem concerning the Party is rendered more aoute by the faot. that we have in the course of a few short weeks swung from one extreme to the other, and we
must now inevitably pay the price of living up to our income, nay, beyond it.&quot;Two days later the 3xeoutive deoided that:&quot;On June 3rd the only paid positions in the Party will be held by; the.; Secretary and Organiser.   As one of these comrades is on the Continent and the other in prison., their places are being temporarily filled by two other oomrades.    Other persons employed will be the editor, a circulation manager and shop manager.     The salaries for these positions will be  4 per week.&quot;On May 19th divisional organisers were officially in-formed that:&quot;For the current week the normal average expenses will be allowed, but for the following two weeks there must be a cut of 50 per cent, aftor which the situation will be in accordance with the letter forwarded to you by the Acting Secretary.&quot;This is the actual position confronting us and is in no way exaggerated, which means that if .expenses are incurred following the period stated above, such ex-pens es will be divisional responsibility, for it is oertain that the Centre, by this time will be unable to meet these obligations.&quot;As an additional economy the Executive Committee has de-cided that its meetings shall be attended by only one member from each division:   the dismissal of practically all officialj leaves only three of four departments in being:   the FamineFund and the London District Council are to return to King1aStreet..-.In regard to the &quot;Communist Review&quot;, William Paul, whofinds the possession of considerable means not incompatible with his communist principles, states that:&quot;We can now cut out parasitic growths and nourish the real roots.   He the &quot;review, it will go on.   Some time ago I sent in a budget, based on a 48 page issue, showing how the. r Re view! oould maintain itself if editor-ship were done voluntarily.    At the same time I offered to do the Job.&quot;. Scotland appears to be the most hopeful division from tfcfpoint of view of -self-maintenance, but the organisers haverealised the pertinent question of headquarters! dues and askif it is still to receive 3d. for every ld* retained in the division.J.R.Wilson/

Last week William Gallaoher was instructed by his executive to go to Moscow to relieve Tom Bell:   he stronglyobjected/
objected to the journey and it seems probable that Fred Feet, who has just applied for a passport, will go instead.    Bell is believed to be travelling on a passport belonging to        i Measure, who has notified the Passport Office that he has &quot;lost&quot; his. THE YOUNG COMMUNIST LEAGUESomewhat to the surprise of British Coranunists and in striking contrast to the present treatment of the Party Officials, Moscow has decided to send a regular subsidy to the Young Communist League:    180 has been sent over as a gift and the promise of  100 monthly has been given. &apos; The first sum is now in the possession of James Stewart and the dismissed officials, such as William Sarroll, are doing their utmost to obtain a share of this money:   Stewart, on the othtj hand wishes to use it for the forthcoming national confer-enoe of the League and has asked the Berlin Bureau for in-struct ions claiming that if men like Carroll get their way the whole sum wil 1 be swallowed up in salaries.The Executive of the Young Communist League has decided I that Whitsuntide meetings are to be held in Dpsseldorf ,GmUnd Teplitsk Jena, Heilbrdnn, and Jjtf bee:.-..   Delega ies from France, Belgium, Alsace-Lorraine, Holland and Great Britain are to go to Dusseldorf and the expenses of one delegate frcg England will be borne by the Berlin Bureau.The Young Communist League has been instructed by the International Executive to arrange a children&apos;s week from June 25th-July 2nd and detailed instructions for each day&apos;e propaganda have been sent: stress is laid upon the assertioi that:-&quot;We are, furthermore, witnessing the attempts of the clergy to regain the lost ground In the schools.

JThe Young Communist - International represents the Central Body of the Young Communist Movement throughout the world;   Its tasks consist of assisting and furthering the Young Communist Movement both by ;    spiritual and financial means, and the forming of new - Young Communist Leagues...&quot;...The primary duty of the Young Communist International is to ooudUct the work&apos; among the younger strata of the army and the mobilised, and to assist in the establishment of illegal military organisations of the proletariat.   The anti-militarist activity is only a part of a vigorous methodical Communist work within the general proletarian class struggle, because it may lead to a one-sided absorption of the forces of the organisation and to misguided anarohistic tendencies.&quot;In the aamies modelled on the principle of universal military service, the revolutionary propaganda must be   pushed within the ranks, undermining this support of the bourgeois dictatorship by&apos; thoroughly spreading Communist ideas...      -&quot;Communist/
&quot;Communist nuclei must be formed within the military assooletions to conduct an intensive revolutionary propaganda, working for the disintegration of, the bourgeois army and preparing for the proletarian Red Army.   Under, a favourable political and revolutionary situation, the Communists must further the establishment of soldiers1 committees and oouncils.&quot;Wherever it is required by the revolutionary movement, revolutionary organisations must be formed within the military associations (soldiers&apos; circles, councils, eto.) It is, however, the duty of these organisations not to seek any petty alleviations for the., soldiers, but to intensify the Revolutionary propaganda and to work for the &quot;rapid. . disintegration of the entire army..*&quot;As regards the- purely bourgeois military organisations with their consciously counter-revolutionary standard-bearers there is only one tactical method possible:   violence against violence. &quot;. - -        . .;:&quot;The propaganda; among the colonial troops must be of a particular character...&quot;But the demand for demobilisation and disarmament is also counter-revolutionary,,--because5 it beclouds the necessity&apos; for the working class in.every country for an armed conflict&apos; with the bourgeoisie, because, it raises deceptive: Illusions of, peaceful evolution into the.

r^ISTS AND LABOUR EEHiESEMTATIOJBiThe oommunistB are straining every nerve to secure eleotlox^as delegates to the annual conference of the Labour party and the Trades Union Congress,   an instance of their methodsis given in the following communication:&quot;I em now going to offer some criticism to,the .   industrial section of the Openshaw Branch, or at least the Amalgamated Engineering Unionrs section.   The threeballots/arming of the proletariat represent b an important-element of the-aotlvlties in the rural dirtrlots&apos;,..Alongside the resolute and indefatigable&quot; struggle for the physical welfare of its ohildren, it &apos; must conduct an equally energetio oampaign against the bourgeois class spirit in school and bhuroh, against all forms of bourgeois moral and political persuasion over the proletarian child...&quot;... In the schools the members of Communist Children&apos;s Sections form oentree of proletarian opposition against Clericalism, nationalism and Bourgeois morality.   They form a battle front against the tyranny of the school bureauoraoy, they agitate for the formation of pupils&apos; councils, for the abolition of corporal punishment, home tasks, etc...&quot;fhe Oommunist Children^ Sections have furthermore i       the task1 of awakening and cultivating among the children, ;\     adhesion and enthusiasm for the power of the Soviets, for the military defence of the Devolution end the international solidarity of the Proletariat of all countries.    As long as the majority of the professional teachers and guardians still remain reactionary or indifferent, the Communist Children&apos;s Sections serve as an effective means of preventing open or covert abuse of the Communist teachers and the older youth, the Communist Children&apos;s Sections will wage a decisive war 6n all Survivals of religious superstitions, bourgeois morality and nationalism among children&apos;a masses..  &quot;The Exeoutive Committee presides over and leads the entire Young Communist International,   it gives out the fundamental and tactical directions for the entire Young Communist Movement:   it supervises the entire 1 activities of the Young Communist international:   it, finally,, organises and leads all.the International Actions of Youth.   The Exeoutive Committee assists the Young Communist Leagues in a large measure in their propaganda and agitation and forms Young Communist Leagues wherever there are none in existence...n...If neoessary, the Executive Committee erects in various oountries technical and other auxiliary Bureaus - &quot; which are, however, absolutely subordinated to the International Exeoutiye Committee. &quot;
- iosiballots of the Amalgamated Engineering Union vis.t delegate to Annual labour Party Conference, delegate &quot;to Fi: ,    Appeal Court, and delegate to Trade Union Conference, are items which should oommand the attention of your Amalgamated Engineering Union Groups.   I hare the monthly report of the Amalgamated/Engineering Union before me and &quot;   ; see in the ballot of all three you have several oomrades running.   First the Annual, Labour Party Conference.    You have been successful in getting Jimmy Shaw in the final ballot and Siddall, who also ran, secured 345 votes.   This is a bad policy as J. Shaw only reaches the final ballot bjj 15 votes and can be said to be very luoky to get there at&apos; all.   Next there is the Final Appeal Court.   This shows the; leakage completely.   The top figures are 796 and 685.   Herd ,  is a list of the communists, that were running in the same ballot:   Tommy Dickson 530&apos;, Bob Howarth 84, Siddall 85. If you had done the Job properly you would have requested Howarth and Siddall to: stand down and run Diokson, who &apos; would have been in the final ballot, instead of which, twos &quot;   reactionaries are in the final, ballot.   Now the Trades      I Union Congress, not yet voted upon,.   I see you have made   1 the same mistake only worse.   Here are the list of oommunil T. Dicksonj,&apos;B . Howarth, J. Shaw, P. Siddall.    Your/Amalgamated Engineering Union members.,lc?i0W; full well that 1 they have about a week, to decide whether they will contest! the ballot and if your industrial group, is working, they. should call a meeting as soon as the nominations are in . and decide which: one is torcontest.   By this means they could capture the seat every. time.   Pass this on to the bo as:a hint for the future and&quot;see that the tellers get busy.-when&quot;the voting is On ^t^e&apos;branch., la order to secure thai success of J. Shaw at the Labour Conference., ana do the be they can for T. bickson in the Trades Union Congress ballo Tommy has.the best chance as will be seen from previous figures.   I have topped the poll for the Labour Party Conference and will go to &apos;. the final ballot in my district and am not running; for the other two, by arrangement.&quot;On May 15th Harry Webb informed divisional organisers official!that: .&quot;You will be&quot;fully aware about the forthcoming Labour Party Conference to.be. held, in Edinburgh in June. This Conference is all-import ant to the Communist Party in view of the decisions.ofr the Party; Conferences.&quot;Already there are indications that quite a number of our members will be representing Trade Unions, Labour Parties, etc, on this occasion, and we are anxious that 8 co-ordinated effort be made by all Communist Party members&quot;Therefore I want you to supply me with names and addresses of oomrades who will be attending the Labour :: ;   Party Conference so that we bah attend to this matter when the Conference is held.   Boh Stewart, Scottish organiser, is anxious to get such comrades together on the j day before the Conference.&quot;Ellen Wilkinson has been nominated by the Exeoutive of her Union, the national Union of Distributive and Allied Workers, for the woman1 s group on the parliamentary committeeox/
- n -of the Trades Union. Congress and. has reported that she is concentrating, on.the miners&apos; vote:   she has asked Harry Pollitt for. assistance, in,, regard to the railway and iron votes and has offeree, to reciprocate if he is nominated for any group. &apos;.THE RED XHTERJ^^mjAL^pli1 LABOUR UMIOHSLosovakys the general seoretary.of the Red International of Labour Unions, has informed the British Bureau that the second international congress will he held in Moscow, ^     &quot;beginning on October 25th of this year:   the executive bureau has decided upon a preliminary agenda covering: 1.     Rex^ort of the Executive Bureau.2.     Tasks of the revolutionary trade unions and the united front.-3.     The Comintern and the profintern.4,   ; -question of organisation.5.     Position of trade unions in colonial countries. The British Bureau has been instructed to consider the agenda and to send concrete &quot;propositions&quot; to Moscow.ARRESTS &amp; OOiTVlOTIOHSThe Chief Constable of Sheffield informs me that on May 17th a boiler maker named Ernest Kill, was sentenced to three months&apos; hard labour at the locaD Polio6 Court for assaulting a constable;    the offence occurred on May 15th when massed picketing at Messrs. Jessop^s Works resulted in an attack upon the premises.The Chief Constable of Barrow informs me that on May 19th the following persons were convicted in the local Police Court:James Eveason, fined 15/- for using obscene language; William Seorge Biddulph, sentenced to 1 months imprison^ment for assaulting a constable; and John Power McMahon, tinted 20/- for using threats.Irish/
IRISH REVOLUTIONARY ACTIVITIES IN GREAT BRITAINThe Midlands gun-running conspiracy continues- to develop along satisfactory linesc   0&apos;Dalaigh still evades arrest out his schemes have been nullified.   He first came under notice in Flcvember last in connection with a similar conspiracy to steal and export arms and explosives.   In that case also he managed to escape although numerous arrests were made end large quantities of war material fell into the handsof the Police.Documents seized in the present ease show that O^alaigh and Scan!on had considerable dealings in material for/use of &quot;General&quot; Rory   0T0crinorT3 army, and were the chief agents operating in this country      Active Republicans in London are perturbed over these arrests.In the course of those enquiries it transpired that live ammunition,, sold by the Disposals Board to private firms for the purpose of being broken up, was being transported from place to place openly end without any precautions being taken.   This matter has been brought to the notice 03? the Board with the result that measures are being taken by them to see that all lorries conveying war material are safeguarded.The moderate Irish in this country regard the de Valera-Collins pact with suspicion for, although most of them trust Arthur Griffith to carry out his under baking, they have littla faith in Collins,   The general opinion is that ds Valera has scored,   ia &quot;exchange for a withdrawal of the threat of civil war he harv secured his position and avoided what would have been absolute defeat if a free contested election had been allowed to take place.   Previous experience has shown them that the Republicans, and especially de Valera, will only keep to an agreement so long as it suits their purpose.With/
With the object of organising; Irish opinion in London in favour of the Treaty a meeting was held at the &quot;Four Provinces&quot; Club, Hussell Square, on the 16th May.   A letter was read from the old time Fenian, Dr. Marie Ryan, approving of the Treaty and condemning the reprehensible methods of the extremists.   A Committee was formed for the purpose of oolleotlng funds to aid the people at home &quot;who would carry out the tangible purpose of the Treaty.&quot;The officials of the Irish Self-Determination League, most of them Republicans, are availing themselves of the temporary settlement in Ireland to endeavour to infuse new life into the League, now almost defunct.   The agreement a will give both sections   an opportunity of coming together but the trouble is only being deferred;   the rank and file of the League appear to have lost all confidence in its present leaders, who are accused, among other things, of having squandered the funds of the organisation.A correspondent Informs me that the Bolsheviks hope to make Ireland the jumping off ground for a European revolution. A communist named Hughes, of Liverpool, who has been in Dunlin, says that Roderick Qonnolly, president of the Communist Party of Ireland, and Rory 0*Connor of the irregular Irish Republican Army, understand each other and last week are alleged to have had an interview with one of the direct agents of Tchitcherine.    De Valera is said to be cognisant of all this and to be well pleased with the progress made.The reported agreement between the two seotions In Ireland was the subject *f much criticism at the Connolly Club. 171, Renfield Streets, Glasgow, on Sunday, 21st May.   The President, Philip Flanagan, advised the meeting to be careful and not travel too fast as the report was one from a hostile press.   He asked them to remain steady and united until official oonfirma-tion reached them .    Personally he had full confidence in the Bepublioan Party and every faith that they would carry the question to a successful issue.
