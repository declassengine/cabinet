0 dhb(This document 1b the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government).IDENCIAL Q A B III SI.3991EXCLUSION PROM THIS COUNTRY OF FORMER ENEMY ALIENS. Memorandum by the Home Secretary.I desire to take the opinion of the Cabinet on the question whether section 10(1) of the Aliens Restriction (Amendment) Act, 1919, is to be allowed to lapse in December next.     This Section provides that wno former enemy alien shall, for a period of three years after the passing of this Act, be permitted to land in the United Kingdom either from the sea or from the air, or, if he should land without permission, to remain in the United Kingdom, without the permission of the Secretary of State, to be granted only on special grounds, and such permission shall, save as hereinafter provided, be limited in duration to a period of three months, and may,   upon special grounds, be renewed from time to time for a like period&quot;.The period of three years mentioned in the Section will expire on the 23rd December, 1922, and I have not included in my programme of legislation this Session any Bill to extend the operation of the Section.My attention has recently been drawn by the Colonial Office to the desirability of definitely settling the question now for the following reasonss-Provisions for the excluoton of former enemy aliens similar to those in Section 10(1) of the Act of 1919 have been adopted in all the Crown Colonies and Protectorates, and the Colonial Office have received communications from some of the Colonies pressing for information as to the policy the Government intend to adopt in this country after   December next.     For example, a aespatoh has been received by the Colonial Office from the Governor of Hong Kong pointing out that many Germans have
returned to Oanton and are carrying on business there and suggest-ing that British firms in Hong Kong will be placed at a &apos;disadvantage in their   dealings with Chinese;if the policy of exclusion of Germans from Hong Kong le continued indefinitely. The existing Ordinance for Hong Kong expireB in August next and the Governor wishes to be informed at once what is to be the policy of the United Kingdom.     The colonial Office have sent me a copy of the despatch for my observations.My own view is that Section 10(1) should be allowed to&apos; lapse.     There 1b sufficient power to control the entry of former enemies into this country without thiB Section - which in fact has been found to impose very difficult limits oh the discretion of the Home Secretary.Section 1 of the Act of 1919 extended for one year the powers of making Orders in Council for the control of aliens given by the Aliens Restriction Act, 1914, and this Section has been continued annually by the Expiring Laws Continuance Act.     Under the current Order in Council the entry into the United Kingdom of any individual alien or any class of aliens can be prevented or can be made subject to limitations as to the length of stay in this country or to such other conditions as may be desirable.-    Moreover, the existing regulations can, if necessary, be quickiy and accurately adapted to the changing necessities of the case by amending Orders in Council.So far as there may be reasons for discriminating against former enemy aliens in the matter of leave to land in this country, all proper effect can be given to them more conveniently under the general powers than by the process of making exceptions from an indiscriminate prohibition such as that contained in Section 10(1). This provision was inserted in the Bill, at a time when anti-German feeling ran high, owing largely to a fear in some quarters that the Borne Off Joe was not to be trusted to exercise sufficient

But recently there has been little evidence of such feeling, and such public comment as there h&amp;B been on the subject has been mainly hostile to the provision, on the ground that it necessitates the exclusion of harmless aliens (as e.g. in the much advertised oaee of Dr* O-Bcar Levy) or that it hampers trade by preventing German traders settling or making prolonged stays in this country.If thiB Seotion is allowed automatically to expire, I do not think there will be any substantial orltioism or any serious effort to secure   its resurrection.If the Cabinet agree that the Section be allowed to lapse for the United Kingdom, it will not of course neoesoarily follow that the same polioy should be adopted by all the Colonies and Protectorates.     The needs and wishes of the Colonies and Protectorates may no doubt differ according to the circumstances of each, and I will confer with the Colonial Secretary as to the best method of dealing with Colonial requests for guidance.Arother Section of the Act of 1919 - Section 11 - which prohibits the acquisition by former enemy aliens of any land in the United Kingdom or any interest in a key industry -also expires at the end of this year.     This is not a provision with which I am primarily concerned, but I do not know that there is any sufficient ground for fresh legislation to keep it alive.E.S.24th May, 1922.
