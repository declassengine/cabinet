December relative to my proposals retrain-; the Imperial Institute, -end to our brief conversation on the matter at a subsequent inter-view, when you suggested that I should sec you after I had consulted the other High Commissioners and the Agents General of the Australian States, I have not found it possible to   -approach my colleagues, the representatives of tho other Dominion;;;, until the proposal to house the Imperial War Kunoup in the Imperial Institute, which- has been before the Committee presided ever by Lord Crawford, has been dealt with.   If it is decided to house the Imperial War Museum exhibits in the Imperial Institute building, then I foel there will be no object in my proceeding with my proposals.   Further, I feel that, considering the response which the prime Ministers of Australia and Eew Zealand made to the appeal to support the Imperial Institute by contributing last year the sum. of  2,000 and  1,000 respectively, which sums would very likely be made available each year, it would seem something like a breach of faith if steps were taken which, would contract the space at present at the disposal of the Imperial Institute to such an extent that the exhibits would not be displayed to the bent advantage,  to say nothing of there not being room for legitimate expansion.    It seems to me also that it would be entirely opposed to the Charter under which the Imperial Institute was,formed, and which has, I understand, been endorsed by subsequent Acts, of parliament, if exhibits repre-santing the products and industries of the Dominions were to be replaced by exhibits mostly of a warlike character.Merely from the point of view of economy I think that the Mother Country and the Dominions should concern themselves with the suggestions I have put forward to concentrate Imperial organisations and prevent overlapping,  for I am con-vinced that there is overlapping, for instance between the Mineral section of the Imperial institute and the Imperial Mineral Resources Bureau.    I presume that Sir James Stevenson has reported to you on this question,&apos; -and I should he much surprised if the report did not agree&quot;with what I have stated. 1 have   felt it my duty to enquire into the administration of the Imperial Mineral Resources Bureau, and I was astounded to
find that the salary roil amounted to- over .212,000 per annum, although,  since my enquiries, it is true reduction:-- hdve- &quot;been uade.    I an satisfied, however, that further econc*.iRS can be secured and that the various Imperial organisjatiohn may -be mn.de to serve much nore fully the purposes of-the jlrvpire than they do at present.I should be grateful if,you could appoint a time to see me on thin matter.  ,Yours sincerely,   . (sgd.). . J. ALLBir.3 &apos; hit. h,o.i c-ararm,  Td&quot;. 4th April,  192?.
