THE COMMUNISTS AMD THE ENGINEERS.This week has produced further evidence of communist influence in the engineering dispute.    A feature of the dispute.has been the constant travelling of communists from one industrial centre to another for purposes of agitation..On May 12th the Lancashire divisional organiser, Crossley,sent the following oiroular to branches In his division:!&apos;Comrade J. Mow at t,! of the Barrow Branch of the Communist Party has just arrived here as a courier from Barrow with the news that &quot;there, is a remarkable situation there In the Barrow Area.     The whole of the workers affected, have unanimously refused to accept the mandate of the Bxecutive Committees of the various&quot;Unions to resume work, and as you will observe by this morning&quot;s &quot;Daily Herald&quot;, they ate solidly welded together in a Rank and File Unemployed and Workers&quot; Committee.&quot;Huge demonstrations and Mass pioke ting takes place daily and there are remarkable demonstrations of men and women marching in Military formation under the control of specially appointed officers.    Workmen&apos;s trains are held up each day and intending strike &quot;breakers pulled out.    A mass meeting was held on Sunday last under the auspices of the Barrow Trade Union Co-ordination and Disputes Committee.     3,600 people were present and they unanimously passed a resolution pledging all workers of the 47 unions and the Amalgamated Engineering Union to refuse to return to work, end to preserve a United Front along with the Amalgamated Engineering Union against resumption,. as any re turn to work would be a gross b e tr ay al of their Amalgamated Engineering Union comrades.&quot;A further mass meeting on Monday sent telegram to Prank Smith, secretary of the Joint Engineers and Shipbuilding Federation and Workers&apos; Union, stating &quot;Barrow workers return your mandate.    Refuse to return to work.    Unemployed and Workers United.    Mass picketing. 1 baton charge.    You are responsible.     Get out or fight&quot;.&quot;Barrow Trades Union District Committee have also sent similar messages to their respective Unions.&quot;Correspondence has been held up.     They had received rumours to the effect that similar action was being taken in Coventry and on the Clyde, and that Military had been called out on the Clyde but refused to act(no confirmation of latter report has been reoeived to date). All workers in Barrow are looking to the rest of the country to follow their splendid lead.     Their local officials who advised the men to accept the mandate of the B.Cs., but who were turned down unanimously, are now working whole heartedly with the men on the Mass ploketlxfefeto/
It is up to the other centres to strain every nerve to see that their respective districts take a similar course as otherwise the spirit will peter out ia.Barrow under tbi concentrated action of the authorities.   In Sheffield where a good fight has been put up, there is already a feeling that the other districts,,are not going; to respond, and they have had notice from their 23.Cs/ that the District Committee may expect being suspended by the Amalgamated Engineering Union.&quot;A joint Loblc-Out Committee has been formed at Sheffield composed of representatives from the Amalgamated Engineering Union, Electrical Trades Union, Woodworkers Union, Enginemen and Firemen, Smiths and Strikers.   Strain v   every nerve Comrade to get the Look-Qut Committees and Unemployed in your area to take action along similar lines to that outlined above, &apos; The Comrades of the Communist Party are behind the movements in Barrow and Sheffield andll look to their comrades In other Branches te rally to their aid.   Please send any reports of developments to me at your very earliest so that 1 may pass them on to the various places where they may be useful.   Let the call be &apos;A11 in for a United Front to stop the retreat1.In a covering letter to the national organiser he wrote i&quot;I have sent a report to a number of the livest districts in Lancashire area asking the comrades to do all in their power to stimulate action along the lines of Barrow and have got a fine band of messengers in oase they are needed for courier work.     I am rather of the opinion that Barrow is an isolated case, but If its example can be used to stimulate action elsewhere believe that every effort should be made in this direction.     Enclosed is a copy of the oiroular letter which I have sent to the branches where there is any possibility of action.   Comrade Liowatt is in Liverpool to-day and will&apos; return to-morrow,in this connection I am informed by the Chief Constableof Barrow that all those oommunists whose activities have beenunder observation have taken a leading part in the masspicketing and demonstrations in the past ten days.   The chief constable informed me on May 12th that:&quot;Scenes of a character hitherto unheard of here have been prevalent during the past week.   A majority of the men engagod in the shipbuilding yard of Messrs. Vickers Ltd. were against the decision to take less wages and at a mee4 of the various unions held last Sunday afternoon it was decided not to resume work.   Massed picketing which began at the-end of. last;week was carried out on intensified lines Those who resumed work on Monday morning were so terrified that on Tuesday morning they failed to turn up, and on Wednesday and Thursday morning the number was further decreased, and assaults on workmen on their way home occurred.     On Wednesday night some Of the workmen who \-     travel to and from their homes by -train were pulled out of the train and assaulted.      On Thursday forty police officers, ten of whom are mounted; were obtained from theLancashire/
Lancashire Constabulary and since then we hare been-able, to control the crowds better and give more adequate protection to the workmen when going, to and fro&quot;m their work.   During the week meetings of the unemployed have been help.dt and the man have been organised in sections and companies and marbhed about the;town; &apos; and it is believed that they are armed with sticks, chisels, etc., which they threaten &quot;they -will use. - They are apparently commanded by-., men who have served in the, army and conform to military words of command,, and at a procession of the different commands on Wednesday there&quot;were between three and four thousand menB   There has not been, however, what one might term a serious breach of the peace but of, course there are ;   plenty who would like to have such an occurrence,&quot;Similar occurrences appear to have taken place in Sheffield where the police have been re-lnforoed on the application of the Chief Constable by seventy-five men from the West Biding lorce. &apos;&quot;v ;&quot;;&quot;Xismer, Hannon and Woodhead are active in Sheffield and the first named has sent the following request to J.R. Campbell in Glasgow:&quot;Is it possible to supply me with a copy of the secret circular referred, to in the Herald yesterday and to-day. It will be very valuable here where thinga are -assuming a very rosy outlook.   As a result of the policy adopted we are gradually shutting down all shops, federated and non-federated alike in spite&apos;of the opposition of officials and the authorities,&quot;On May 14th a young Sootsman, whose name is given as Haigh, informed a meeting of engineers at Sheffield that he had recently visited various engineering centres including Barrow and Manchester.The Chief Constable of Coventry informs me that meetings of unemployed end looked-out men continue to be held in that City:   mass pioketing has been maintained but no disorder has occurred, although it is possible that some men may be summoned: some of the Birinihghsm Police have been drafted to Coventry where Leckie and Dingley are the ringleaders:   Mrs. Helen Crawfurd has also been there and Shillito is still active: Robert Orrell appears to have visited Birmingham last week.Sean Moloughlin has addressed unemployed meetings In Safceshead, Newcastle, South Shields, Jarrow and West Hartlepool.OJhe/- S -
&quot;This joint conference of all District Committees of Organisations involved in the engineer! lock-out in the County of London expresses profound disappointment and dissatisfaction at the stage to which the engineering and shipbuilding look-out has developed.&quot;The conference is of opinion that the time has arrived for the policy of defence to be replaced by a policy of attack, and demands that the members employed in the maintenance of gas, water, sewage and electric light and power undertakings in -oho Co wit y ofj Loudon&apos;be immediately instructed to tender sevon days notioe&quot;, in accordance with their statutory obligationsH wich a view toforcing the engineering employers to withdraw their unjust demands, and thus bring the     g dispute to a speedy conclusion.&quot; IIt was stated at the Conference that Barking, East Hat Grave send, Ilford and Kensington were in favour of a genereS stoppage of utility services and McLaughlin in moving the Bresolution, stated that the stoppage of sewerage was a vitalpoint of attack:   there is no indication of anything like II general support of the extreme measures advocated at this p conference for whioh Tom Mann, Harry Pollitt and other meoB of the Red International of Labour Unions are largely responsible. fta good deal of ill-feeling has been caused during thef week by disclosures in the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; regarding aseorlThe oommuniate George Deer. Tom Monohan and W. Tripp have been largely responsible for the recent disturbances Lincoln:   a contingent of London mounted police is in the . City and their presence seems to have allayed the foars ofi works1 managers and the general public.On May 15th a conference of some 300 delegates from ! London trade unions Was held in the Memorial Hall: the speakers who included Tom Mann, J. Holt (organised unemployment W.J. Webb (secretary of the London district of the KLeotric Trades Union) and R. MoLaughlin (X on don district organisei the Electrical Trades Union), J.W. Lawrence and Wolsey, wei mostly extremists.   The following resolution was passed:-

The working .t, ...   class,; however,. is not only able to support Soviet Russia politically, but it is able by sending across technically qualified workers, sending across Tools and Machines, and by means of loans within certain limits, the.;rpcwer to assist Soviet Russia equally in the -.7 x   ,-:r:::&apos;;.eoo:nomi.o. field.   In the carrying out of these decisions the Workers International Pamine Relief Committee has been able to take over, more especially in the Famine is as .   ; iAreas,; and; where ..essential to its work-, in other3 - &amp; q to      ix-: . r- parti/
parts of Russia, a series of undertakings and Factories in its own management.   Over the theoretical side of this question, as well as over the practical results so far &apos; v     achievedmany articles have appeared. in. the International Press Correspondence and elsewhere.   It Is now necessary that this started production help should be supported in every way by all means at disposal, through publicity in the party press, dealing with the. necessity to extending the Relief to productive Relief, and explaining this to (        the broad masses, xthro.ugh, the provision of a series of&apos;     ;publie meetings in all countries where the same subject is dealt with, through the collection and sending over of Tools and Machines.   It is intended as soon as the^    ;/undertakings already taken over have reached a certain productivity to publish the, s,cqurate&apos; figures and materials to give to the masses, so as possibly to lead to the :Introduction .qf an.   International Workers Loan for the extension of such work.&quot;At the same time the whole matter is being considered by commercial and business commissions so as .to find the happiest /way to carry through the work.   At the :: moment no. material help pah be &quot;given except through the ;     collection;of tools^ materials, and money for this purpose.   The scope of the Pemine Relief Action is .    therefore not smaller, but;on the oontrary, latterly, even larger bepome, and deserves, owing to its enormous political importance the very serious attention of all communist parties and organisations.&quot;: .

Party is interested:- &apos;&quot; ,WGEMLRAL. - Since^the last Executive meeting the ....     ..  Electoral Campaigns in Dundee, Motherwell, Tradeston,:.      &quot;Gorton and Coventry constituencies has forged ahead. J   .  ,&quot;&apos;   Reports from these constituencies are Very favourable and show .that the selection of the constituencies .    was a good one.    fi&apos;1 -J/*&apos;LEYTON.    With regard to Leyton the situation is a peculiar one.     There is at present a Labour candidate in the field, and our efforts have been more in the direction of working to secure the withdrawal of the Labour Party nominee rather than to develop separate electoral organisations.     If it is possible to secure the withdrawal of the Labour candidate Malone(s &apos;    1,,    chances are very good, but failing that, and with the weak organisation we possess in that oonstituenoy, it is difficult to say accurately what will be the result. Another foature of the situation there * is that it has been rather diffioult to keep thoroughly in touch with&quot; COmradb!Maloneii     I feel that he is losing touch........ with, the party*s activities.    Endeavours are beingmade to remedy this and secure ia weekly meeting between., *     Halo ne and a small committee consisting of Cook, Willis Mewbold and  ish in order to assist Malene in doing effective.,communist work as an M.P....,. EASg RHONDDA. y With regard to East Rhondda this matter was referred back at the last meeting of the Executive for further reports,     These have not been forthcoming, with the result that the campaign has not developed in that constituency.     Now comrade R.Stewart desires to be relieved of theresponsibility of his canditure there, and as the sub-Exeoutive has agreed to accept this it Seems that it is very little use at present to do anything definite in that constituency.     I am strongly of the opinion that it is not in the best interests of the Party to fight East Rhondda, and I trust that the ExecutiveCoomittee will agree to with-draw this oonstitutnoy from its list.BETHNAL 8REEJ3. - I have to report that two members of tne party, oomrades Windsor and Taughan, have been .   definitely aooepted as Labour Party candidates for the two constituencies in Bethnal Green.    The CP. branofc has made a request that if at all possible we might assist them to the extent of granting  50 to help meet the expenses on these two dandidatures.BjOMFORD. * I ha-re been approached by the Barking Wand witn the request to consider the possibility of the CP. financing a communist whose nomination can be secured as Labour candidate for the Romford Parliament&apos; ary divisionfhe/
This/Tho fabtB are these;    Romford Parliamentary division has. not ae yet got a definitely adopted labour candidate.     She labour Party selection Conference meets on 23rd May,   The only name-up to the present before them is that of HSniil:&apos;..&apos;Davio&apos;s,the Pabian.   The C-&apos;P* has control of the Barking Trades Council and practically the Labour Party,   The branch 1b confident that if it can find a suitable candidate it can get a Communist adopted asLabourcandidate instead of Bmil Davies,     The only fly in the ointment$ie that if a Communist Was adopted, the C P. v/would  have ft o be responsible for.  150 Jy% the election expends.   If the CP. can guarantee to find . 150 then the branch is confident that it. can get&apos; the&apos; nomination through. The prinoiple unions in the^district are the A.E.U. and the E.T.U.     Preferably the Communist should be a member of one of these organisations.   If an A.E.U. Communist oan be found then the Party will only have to find  100 as the A.E.U. will contribute  50. Rest of expenses will be found by Divisional Labour Party. ,  , ..  ..... ,.    .   u   !The constituency; is a mixed .,industrial&apos;and agricultural one, the industrial predominating^   ThA Labour vote at 1910 election was 7,624 against 10 s 300/ for tho Coali-tion Liberal so. that the prospects of&quot;Labour winning the seat are favourable.     The Coalition member is in bad favour now.    At a recent Council Eledtion in tho constituency in.a ward for which the .M.P. had sat for 15. years he was heavily defeated by a Labour candidate. It appearB to me that this case is just one where the E.C should act and get a Communist put forward as the nominee of th e working el as s moveme nt.     The CP. branch are of the opinion that a nationally known Communist who is an A.2.U. or E.T.U. man; would be the best man. &quot;&apos; &apos;    lr&apos; u  .. .,&quot;&apos;.&apos;;This,.was discussed&apos; at the last sub E.C. meeting who decided to recommend agreement with this proposal, and I have nOw communicated with Barking branch and suggested that the names of J.T.Murphy or George Deaopn go forward. ______ABERDEENt. SHEFFIELD: BIRMINGHAM:. aND WEST PIPE -K&apos;opo*salB have been eubmi^ed by&apos; the branches in these constituenoies requesting sanction, for. the running of CP., candidates.    Pull details reports7 have been put before the sub E.C. and they feel, that in.,the oase of Sheffield the correct tactic would be to move through the Labour Party or Unemployed movements.  In. Birmingham we feel that the case presented aha the Party*s financial position does not warrant sanction.With regard to Aberdeen the same applies..   West Pife, the matter remains.in abeyance and* no recent reports of developments hive been forthcoming.ELECTORAL INFORMATION. - Three issues of the Propagand-Tsts.1- notes have been issued and have net with approci-ation in the - constituencies and by the Party &quot;speakers generally, but I,feel that this kind of work should become a permanent feature and should bis the task of ... the , Information Department.* ..... .,...,-..... .. s,
This Information is stn.^plemented in a cominunicationxeoshily sent by A.E.Oook to the Scottish organiser;-WI have &quot;been approached by the Mbtherwell Election Oommittee with a proposal that a ten or fourteen days1 1 campaign between the constituencies of Motherwell, Dundee and Tradeston.   The Idea is to get two or three national speakers into the district arid Interchange     j them &quot;between the districts.   I should like your observe! tions on the proposal and suggestions how it could he I worked*    Suppose we take the three candidates. Mrs.    I Orawfurd. Gallaoher and Newbold. and any other throe    I good speakers in Scotland whom you coulci suggest, could not the series of meetings T)e arranged and the person el of the speakers such as to guarantee the attracting of good crowds*    I oould probably assist to the extent of a  10 grant from the election fund, and the rest of the exes shared between the local election oommittee and the collections at meetings.? * * ,       &apos;&quot;I suppose you have heard from Comrade Peet that the Sub-E.C. agreed to relieve you of the proposedB candidature for Bhondda Bast,     Personally from reports 11 coming in I think it will be as well if the E.C. with-draws from the Rhondda fight entirely.     Comrade J.R.   B Wilson is opposed to this, but I know from my experienoeg en this joh during the last few weeks that the Bhondda 1 branches have shown no Eigris of enthusiasm for the con-test as such, and in that case seeing that we have not  i committed ourselves Very much, and also it is hard to see how we are going to finance more than three or four I contests. I.think it as well that it should be dropped.   1 In any case the Gaheral Election does not seem imminent I and if the&apos; situation does alter at a latea/stage it will i not preclude us from coming into the field again. Again with our growing influence in the Rhondda I think I the&apos; task of our chaps ought to bo moving in the diroctloal of getting Watts Morgan officially withdrawn, and then   I the sltuation can be considered.11 iThe Communist Party has recontly issued gratis a&quot; series of propagandist notes for use in its election campaign and divisional organisers have now been asked if arrangements can be made to pay for these;   Robert Stewart has repliedthat he uses about 70 of each issue and might find a way of paying for them as they &quot;are highly appreciated&quot;:   alternative-ly he suggests that there might be a &quot;propagandists&apos; cornerla *The tommuaist1&quot;.TEE NATIONAL ADMIN ISTRATITEE council.

Haye announced that the total income from November 18th, 1921 to April 22nd, 1922, was £314. 19. 4., which included a loan of £20 advanced by friends towards the rent of head-quarters at ?, Queen&apos;s Square, which is £150 per annum: expenditure for the same period was £294.12.6. which included a loan of £17.12.6½ to "Out of Work". The financial statement for this paper for the same period showed an income of £586.?.?.: this amount including the above loan, had bean spent. The total cost of the present meeting was £14.3.9. It was decided that Haye should act as treasurer instead of Sguair as the latter had been appointed London organiser. T.-? (Fulham), S. Swain (St-Pancras) were selected as auditors with C. Deacon (Ilford) to act in advisory capacity: James Lyle was elected editor of "Out of Work" and Redmond (Croydon), Hannington and Haye were elected as "Press Committee". Haye stated in his report that 67 committee, exclusive of those in South Wales had affiliated to the national organisation since the Manchester conferenoe. Elias stated that there were about thirty committees in South Wales but the late divisional secretary had not paid in the fees which he had received and a difficult situation had therefore arisen. Hannington said that following the discussion at the last conference regarding the raiding Of factories he "had been busy in this direction": he detailed some of the raids that had been taking place and added that/
that he had attended conferences in divisions 3, 4 and 5 and whilst in these areas had addressed meetings in Birkenhead, Bootle, Coventry, Leeds, Liverpool and Manchester.

Mrs. Thring reported that there was not much to say regarding the women&apos;s position but that No. 4 division was the most active: she considered that the organisation of women was so far, on the whole, a failure owing to lack of support from the men and mentioned that she had taken part in the raid on the Ediswan Lamp Factory in Ponder&apos;s End.

It was resolved that "the National Administrative Council consider the present time is inopportune to organise a National "No Rent Strike" and "that the National Administrative Council instructs the divisional councils that a National Agitation be proceeded with, with a view to putting into operation a National No Rent Strike, the divisions to report result of activities to the National Administrative Council Secretary".

The following resolutions on future policy were passed:-

"That we instruct all Committees to form Unemployed and Employed Workers Councils wherever possible, with a view to co-ordinating the activities of both."

"That we recommend to all local committees that they should sub-divide themselves into sub-committees such as industrial, financial, propaganda and organisational. Also that l2 is a suitable number for local committees." 

"That we recommend that speakers of the Unemployed Organisation shall visit Trade Union Branches to state the case of the Objects of the N.U.W.C.M."
