[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.   March 1922.SECRET.CP. 3903.CABINET.THE IRAQ TREATY.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.I CIRCULATED to the Cabinet on the 17th February last (C.P.-3748) the draft of the proposed treaty with King Feisal of Iraq. The draft treaty received the general approval of the Cabinet on the 21st February, but no final decision was reached upon Article V, which deals with the question of the foreign relations of the Iraq State. Under this.article I submitted three alternative versions for the consideration of my colleagues, viz. : (1) King FeisaFs own version, provisionally accepted by the High Commissioner for Iraq, subject to reference home; (2) a draft accepted by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in January last; and (3) an alternative draft proposed by myself, which aimed at finding a via media between King Feisal&apos;s own demands and the views of the Foreign Office. The three alterna-tives are reprinted in the Appendix below.2. The Cabinet will observe from the paper circulated herewith that a further difficulty has arisen in regard to the treaty. King Feisal is not satisfied with the terms of the preamble as approved by the Cabinet, or with an alternative version suggested by myself, which omitted all reference to the Treaty of Sevres and the draft mandate for Iraq. He insists upon the inclusion of a sentence, stating specifically that the mandate is abrogated, and declares that in default of such a provision he is not prepared to proceed with the negotiations. I am still in communication with Sir Percy Cox on this point, and am not without hope that Feisal may be brought to a more reasonable frame of mind. After personal discussion with Sir Arthur Balfour and Mr. Fisher, as British representatives of the Council of the League of Nations, I am satisfied that the objections to a formal abrogation of the mandate at the present stage are insuperable.3. King FeisaFs attitude in the matter seems to be partly due to a misunder-standing of a message delivered to him by Colonel Lawrence in April 1921, just before he went to Iraq. I consider that the best means of clearing up this misunder-standing will be to send Colonel Lawrence to Bagdad in order that he may make the whole situation plain to the King by oral explanation. I also set great store on Colonel Lawrence&apos;s personal influence with Feisal, which, as my colleagues are aware, dates back to the time of the Arab rising during the^ great war. ,1 have telegraphed this suggestion to Sir Percy Cox, and have no doubt that he will readily accept it.4. I am convinced, however, that even Colonel Lawrence&apos;s influence will be of no avail unless we can satisfy Feisal on the subject of his foreign relations. I must, therefore, ask my colleagues to reconsider the question of Article V. of the draft treaty. I do not wish to press for King Feisal&apos;s own version, but I would strongly urge the Cabinet to accept my own alternative (whichfl understand from Sir Percy Cox, is likely to be acceptable to the King) in preference to the draft proposed by the Foreign Office. The practical difference between the two versions is small. Both give the King a representative in London; neither gives him necessarily a represen-tative anywhere else. Both entrust his interests to the British Government in places where he&quot; is not represented. It is largely a question of language. My draft gives him in principle the &quot; right &quot; of representation; the Foreign Office alternative accords no such &quot; right.&quot;  The point is of little material importance to ourselves, but[8150]
to Feisal it is of considerable consequence in enabling him to satisfy his local critics that a genuine attempt is being made to set up an independent Arab State. Sir Percy Cox is strongly of this opinion, and has represented in a recent telegram that the Foreign Office wording &quot; would injure Feisal&apos;s prestige vitally.&quot; I ask my colleagues to approve the version in the third column below.APPENDIX.Article V.Article V.Article V.King Feisal&apos;s Draft, provisionally agreed to by Sir P. Cox, subject-to reference to His Majesty&apos;s Government.Draft of January 10, suggested by Foreign Office.Colonial Office Alternative to Foreign Office Draft.The Government of Iraq shall have the right of foreign repre-sentation. His Majesty King Feisal shall send his representa-tives direct to London and to such other foreign States as may be agreed upon by the High Contracting Parties.

[This Document is the Property of His &quot;Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government, jPrinted for the Cabinet.   March 1922.SECRET.C.P-3903.CABINET.THE IRAQ TREATY.Translation of a Letter from His Majesty King Faisal to Sir Percy Cox, dated 23rd, received 25th February, 1922.Dear Sir Percy,I HAVE received the modifications made in the Treaty by His Majesty&apos;s Colonial Office of which you supplied me with a copy. I told you when you discussed them with me on Wednesday personally that what I aimed at was to be able to serve my country and safeguard the interests of His Majesty&apos;s Government. The two objects are bound up together and are inseparable from each other. I came here with this sole object in view, and, after having urged upon Mr. Churchill that my ability to execute this duty depended on my being given a free hand for my work and being able to demonstrate to the people that I was the real Ruler. This is one point. Another point is that the moral upheaval which prevails in the East makes it necessary that I should come before the world with a free Treaty such as would silence all enemies. Otherwise, my labours must be doomed to failure. Accordingly, Mr. Churchill agreed to exchange the Mandate for a Treaty.His Majesty the King referred to that in the telegram which he was pleased to send me on the occasion of my Coronation, in which he stated that the relations between Great Britain and Iraq will be regulated by a Treaty of Alliance and Friendship.Your Excellency will undoubtedly remember that, in answer to my request at the time of the Coronation as to the necessity of clearing up the question of responsi-bility, Mr. Churchill wired to your Excellency expressing the view that it was necessary that I should appear before the people as far as was possible as the real Ruler pending conclusion of the projected Treaty.Although I felt that delay in defining the political status of the country and in the conclusion of the Treaty was very prejudicial both morally and materially harmful to my position, seeing that such delay would afford opportunity for wavering and for widening the door of intrigue which was on the point of being closed as the result of the general elections, I still was confident that the past evils could be remedied. I regret, however, that what I feared would happen as a consequence of delay did actually happen. I.nevertheless entertained sanguine hopes from the arrival of Major Young bearing the necessary instructions and from the opening of the negotiations with your Excellency in regard to the basis of the Treaty. I was sure that the foundations which we were agreed upon would not be met with any objection on the part of His Majesty&apos;s Government in London. God knows that I have exerted my best efforts in establishing strong foundation for the future relation of Iraqis with Great Britain, but on a basis of everlasting friendship and not on one of compulsion. I and the Prime Minister were in complete agreement on the question of those principles.Your Excellency may have observed, during your discussions with the Prime Minister with regard to Mandate, that he was more particular and insistent than myself as to the necessity of the abrogation of it from henceforward. This old and venerable Shaikh has spared no effort in advising me from time to time not to embark on any measure likely to create a critical situation. We were all happy at the completion of the discussions and hopeful that His Majesty&apos;s Government would agree to the contents of the provisions arrived at and would crown our endeavours by their acceptance of the same, so that we might celebrate the satisfactory solution arrived at and work hand in hand iii co-operation with Great Britain for the interest of both nations.[8138 I
Now that I have seen the modifications which it is proposed to be introduced into the fundamental provisions of the Treaty I am unable to disguise from your Excellency the great disappointment to my hopes which I had entertained for the success of our negotiations which covered a period of over two months, during which we discussed every Avord of it in a spirit of complete friendship until we arrived at a final conclusion. I had hoped that the settlement at which we had arrived would be received with approval in London. May God bear witness that in that hope I and the Prime Minister did all we possibly could to reach a solution.Now, after further discussion of the subject with His Highness, who, I have no doubt, has communicated the result to your Excellency, we have found that the modifications introduced in the Treaty make it impossible for us to undertake any obligations on this basis vis-a-vis Great Britain. The provisions we formerly agreed upon are the least possible if we are to be able to fulfil our duty towards the country, retain the friendship of Great Britain and avoid failure before&apos;e the world.Should your Excellency hold a different opinion in the matter I would suggest postponement of the Treaty pending the Convention of the Constituent Assembly which can be convened in a short space of time. Sincerity, however, constrains me to state in advance that in such event a field will be opened for a conflict of different inclinations. At this juncture I do not care to disguise the thoughts which crossed my mind with regard to the memorandum you have forwarded in connection with the modifications, explaining the reasons which led the Minister of Colonies to introduce these modifications into our draft. I am aware that it is not within my power to resist the establishment of the Mandate should Great Britain insist on it, nor to change her policy declared through Mr. Fisher in November, nor the attitude she has adopted towards the said Mandate. It, however, appears to me that she can, if she so desires, exchange this Mandate for a Treaty of Alliance, framed on the terms which we have accepted.I regret to hold an opinion different to that held by Mr. Churchill as regards the action of the French Government. The Mandate which France claims in respect of Syria, requires her to act with complete honesty and sincerity; she has no Tight to dispose of the country as a private owner by alienating what she pleases without permission of those who entrusted her with the Mandate. At least it was her duty to consult them in such matters before putting them into execution. If under the circumstances it is right for France, who is one of the chief members of the Society of Nations, to surrender to the enemies of the Allies an extensive portion of the country entrusted to her, and that for the purpose of safeguarding her private interests and without considering it necessary to consult her Allies and those who have conferred on her the power of attorney, why then is it not equally permissible for Great Britain to whom has been entrusted the interests of this country in order to lead her on in the light of that high principle, the principle of assisting the people in a spirit of sincerity and friendship, to exchange certain ambiguous words for a definite statement providing for a sincere and friendly alliance, which will rejoice the people and bring tranquillity and confidence to them. The people have acquired a repugnance towards the term &quot; Mandate,&quot; its terms, and interpretations, which is a result of what they have observed in, the way of abuse by the Mandatory of his Mandate and his employment of the authority vested in him under the said Mandate for the realisation of private aims and objects.I should not withhold from your Excellency the fact, that I, in the same way as all the people of the East, consider Great Britain directly responsible before the Society of Nations and to the peoples which have been placed under French Mandate, for the acts of France, seeing that it was Great Britain who handed the people over to France, her associate in the Society of Nations, and, in the name of the &quot; Mandate &quot; has parcelled out that one country and one people, who have not undergone such a misfortune for centuries. Is Great Britain, in a position officially to declare that France has violated the terms of her Mandate and to ask her to&apos; fulfil her duties and call upon the Society of Nations to assist in preventing France from exceeding the limits of the Mandate? I do not believe that such steps are possible under the existing circumstances. That being so the only thing left us is to ask Great Britain to do what she considers vital and necessary for the people which have been entrusted to her care and to give up her insistence on certain terms the outcome of which is hurt and the creation of doubts and scepticism as between her and this country and to abide instead by the spirit of these terms and undertake to render the people the assistance rendered by an Ally. Such a course would pacify the minds which are full of apprehensions on account of the Mandate.   It will increa.se the peopled
confidence in Great Britain and in her actions and will lead them to join with her in free friendly and honest co-operation. She will gain their everlasting gratitude for having delivered them from the tyranny of the Turks and from the injustice of the unjust and unfair foreign Capitulations. This is the most effective means available for the safeguarding of common interests and the ensurance of peace and tranquillity in the country and its progress on the road of development.God knows that I regret what took place as regard to my &quot; declaration.&quot; I remember you had asked me for a written one and I was prepared to give it. Your Excellency may remember that I was prepared to sign it when I visited you; all I had to say was that as I was not aware of the nature of the undertakings referred to, I must in signing the document leave to your excellency&apos;s honour the future responsibility that might result therefrom. You, however, thought it expedient to postpone signature pending the despatch of a telegram to London. Apart from this, our draft provides with complete clearness that I undertake to see to the execution of all the international obligations of His Majesty&apos;s GovernmentUsual compliments, (Signed)        FAISAL.
