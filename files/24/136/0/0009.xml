ID DIG 25 TH KABGH, 1.922.- (Circulated by the secretary of itate for War)&apos;81. -   Since tho last Boport the following moves have been completed13th Hussars-from Curragh to Aldershot. -1st Gxo &amp; Bucks, L.I5 from Limerick to Dublin, and 2:id Bn0 FmWilas. from Limerick to Curragh.from Cnrr^gh to Ballykin-frem Pormoy to Clandebcyc,Part of this Regiment acting as Escort to a large convoy of Mechanical Trans-port which is being placed at the disposal cf Government of Northern Ireland,l7ith the exception of the troops at Cork, Queens town, and Berehaven; tho Provinces of I (nr. s tor and Gonijaught have now &quot;been evacuated by British Troops-.    It is int. ere sting to note that this final evacuation has boon marked with no hostile demonstration.-,   On the contrary the departure cf tho British troops has in many towns boon viewed with apprehension by the inhabitants.Zj     The state of affairs in Belfast is one of grave anxiety and the danger of the epidemic of. reprisal and- blood fuecL spreading to tho Border&quot;is already apparent.The death roll in Belfast during the past week (20th March to 26th March) isOn 20th March. On 21st March,On 22nd Marcho 2nd En. 3uffolk Ecgt, lar, Co0 Dc\o,On 23rd  larch. 1st BUo queen s Bogt. Co.

A Campaign of evict Lor ia again talcing plaoe in the City, and persons of either re.Lig..^n living in a locality where they are in a religious minority are being intimidated by threats into vacating their homes.     In one case a bomb was thrown into the house of a Roru^n Catholic who had been ordered to vacate, but who did not leave soon.enough to please his intimidators.     All those parsons are seeking personal pro-tection, in addition to practically every shop keeper, rent collector and all persons who have to pass through a disturbed area-3.     In addition to the above several outrages against individuals have been committed in the vicinity of the Border.On the actual Berder itself there, has been a certain amount of sniping increasing at times in the neighbourhood of:-3URNS BRIDGE   (on the boundary near 0A1ED0N)    and L^CITf BRIDGE   (on the boundary near CLONES)The aggressors in this exchange of shots are undoubtedly th3 members of I,R0A. forces in position on the Southern side of the Border.The chief cause of this local irritation is the attempted destruction of BURKS BRIDGE.    I am pressing the northern Government officials for a guarantee&apos; that  th-s destruction of this bridge will not. be proceeded with further.Should I be successful in obtaining this guarantee I am sure it will have a good effect.4.     Inside tho borders of the. Six counties offensive operations on an extensive scale have been carried oub by the 2nd, northern Division of the I,H,,A, in Counties Tyrone and Derry.     The operations have included the murder of t,?o Constables, the capture of MAGHERA and DOMEROY Police Barracks with their arms and. ammunition, the burning of numerous buildings, the blowing up of bridges, and the destruction of communications generally,.       The operations have been so widely scattered and synchronised to such an extent, as to leave no doubt that they form part of a deliberate plan,-     The prepara-tions necessary for the simultaneous execution of the attacks reported show that the plan must have been evolved some days beforehand.     In view of these facts it is difficult to believe that the whole affair was not ter-om to the I.R.A.leaders in DUBLIN,.if not actually planned by them.    This view is con-firmed, by the fact that.&apos;-&quot;Commandant &quot;General&quot; McKEQN (late Blacxsmith) a leading assistant of Collins and Mule any, while speaking at Mullingar on 17th, referred to a corps being organised for operations against the North,-asked for recruits and offered to lead - the corps himself.     It is possible that these operations we re planned in anticipation of a repressive legislation by the Northern- Government.    They cannot have been intended as reprisals for the steps to be taken by the North, announced by Field Marshal.Sir Henry Wilson, nor for the raid on the 3rd Northern Division, I.R.A. Headquarters, in St.Mary&apos;8 Hall, for both these events&apos;took place after the ICR.A. operations had commenced.The reason for this outbreak is rather to be found in a desire by the South to -(a) show   what largo portions of tho Northern &quot;territory is disaffected.(b) to represent the Northern Government as incapable of maintaining law and order, and ;(c) to relievo the situation-both In. Belfast arid on the Borde r.-2-
5. During the period under review there have been several outrages by armed men against goods, mails, and newspapers travelling by train in Southern Ireland which point to bhe general state of lawlessness which prevails.6,   On night 25/26th. Harch, the Armoury at -Tountjoy House (Ordnance Survey Depot) Phoenix Park, was broken into and the Arms of the Hoyal Engineer Detachment (eleven rifles) removed.   The incident is being investigated, the evidenoe points to collusion on the part of some member of the detach-ment with the robbers.7. It is of interest.to note that since the control of o:rplosives has passed into the hands of tho Provisional Government there has been a very marked increase in the issues.The following amounts issued in Hovember, 1921, which wero an average monthly, and in the month 24th Febry, to 26th &apos; March 1922, i2jtustrate this fact*Hovember 1921.24th Feb. -26th March;122Blasting powder Gelignite Detonators Ooils of Fuze10.399 lbs. 5,932   w 200 2512,942 lbs. 21,390   &quot; 18;28543128(Signed) C.F.H.Macready.General,commanding-rinr-Chief, Ireland.&apos;G0H0Qn Ireland.28th March. 1922g
