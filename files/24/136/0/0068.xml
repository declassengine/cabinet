Mersey and Tyne and disorder is possible if the look-out continues.   One correspondent anticipates sabotage and incendiarism on the Clyde*The Exeoutive of the Comintern is reported to have granted a subvention to the value of about  25,000 to the British Communist Party to oover the deficit on propaganda in the first quarter of 1922*The Cemmunist Party&apos;s version of the &quot;United Front&quot; Is given in this report.Details are given of the reoent conferenoe of communists in the South Wales ooalfield.Several &quot;May Day demonstrations were held in the provinces on May 7th hut there was no disorder and in no oase did the attendance exoeed 4,000,The &quot;Daily Herald&quot;, whioh was to have oaaeed publication thia week, is to he oarrled on by Labour for a few months:   details of the orisis are given.
b ENGINEERS AND THE- unemployed in some centres the engineers end the unemployed appear to have joined forces for purposes of&quot; mass picketing: and in several districts the engineers are growing restless.Only one raid has been reported in the Metropolitan area: on May 4th about 150 organised unemployed assembled outside the Rodney Iron and Foundry Company Ltd, and three men entered the factory, calling upon the employees to oease work: on the arrival of the police, the crowa dispersed. The following extracts from a report recently made by a member of the West London Vigilance Committee indicate the lines on whioh the extremist Shop Stewards are working.Regarding the West London Vigilance Committee, we are doing some good work In the district ana as soon as the look-out is over we intend to Ce forward and set up Vigilance Committees in all parts of London on similar, lines to-our, own.     This was already in the air when the lo-ek-out started, but we had to abandon it, as we eould not get the branches to send their delegates while the lock-out business was being dealt with and the lock-out machinery was Being set up.     At the present time we are dealing with the National Committees work re, revision of rules and we have just had a meeting with all the district committee men in West London to force, certain mandates on the delegates to the National Committee.     We are further, inviting the delegates from this area to the National Committee to discuss the proposals..... The branches inthis area are sending their delegates along in nearly every case and we are a healthy movement.     We want to see the same in other districts and also to oe-operate with other Committees of a similar character.     We have also tackled the question of ballots for suoh conferences as the Labour Party Annual Conferenoe. Trades Union Congress, and are backing a certain candidature in every case....... If we succeed In this. work, we shall be a force to be considered within an A.B.U. ballot and shall be &quot;able to sweep the eld school out of *ffioe on the ballot votes as they come along.&quot;On May 8th mass picketing and intimidation resulted in d isturbances at the shipyard gates in Barrow and the police were forced to intervene: on Merseyside generally, the ship-repairers seem loath to return to work on the national terms: on May 9th the Seoretary of the Liverpoolbran oh/
M     Zbranoh of the Federation of Engineering and Shipbuilding Trade   Unions implied that the question&quot; of bringing&apos;$ut*--&apos;&apos; electrloians, dockers, transport workers and seamen was under consideration.The Chief Constable of Lancashire informs me that the intends to take proceedings against a communist engineer named Whitfield. for intimidation in Earls town.I learn from the Chief Constable of Salford that the local engineers are very uneasy and that police action has been necessary on three occasions in order to avert a &quot;breach of the peace. (&apos;&apos;&quot;:Mass picketing is in progress at several factories in Coventry, where the unVniployea&apos; &apos;are bo-operating with the engineers, but rib further disorder has been reported.  &quot;The Chief Constable of Birmingham informs me that the 1 ocal /ooiamunists are partioularly active. among the. unemployed and locked-out engineers:   the decision of the Central Eelief Committee of the Guardians to -restrlot the relief of men -Who refuse to avail themselves of the open workshops has caused a good deal of resentment;   coMounists have figured prominently in processions and deputations. -Owing to mass picketing, the Rolls Royce Werkis in Derby have been closed -down end Cammell laird&apos;a Grimesthorpe Works in. Sheffield.&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos; J &apos;. - . ,  \ &apos;The Chief Constable of Leeds. informs &quot;me that 760 engineers -and 50 unemployed formed, the May Day demonstration in -that, -city:. A: S e an JleLoushiin; left ,leeds : on -May-.Sth for West Har titepo-ol and is, xe p or t e d; to have been present-in Sunderland on the following day when the police forbade an unemployed&quot; meeting which he was to &quot;hUVe: -aaareskea arid dispersed the crowd.&quot;&apos; It i 3 reported that Govan, Clydebank and Dumbarton are&apos; centres in which mass picketing may lead to -trouble: women and children join the crowds whioh Jeer at the men whohove/
elIt is reported on reliable authority that the - Exeoutive of the Comintern has granted a subvention of a quarter of a million gold roubles (i.e.  25,000) to the English Communist Party for the first quarter of 1922:   this money ia intended to cover a deficit on propaganda work.On May 13th the Party Commission will report to a fullexecutive meeting on.The present position of Party organisation FinanceHeadquarters1 Staff :Subscription rates and&quot; divisional finance. . So far the Commission has been compelled &quot; by the urgency of the situation&quot; to concentrate on finacne but it intends to proceed immediately to the question of local and district organisation and the development of the Party activities: branches have toe en warned that the reductions in expenditure already made constitute a beginning only.Harry Webb has informed Divisional organisers that:&quot;The Sub-Exeoutive Ccromittee are fully aware . of the many difficulties involved in transferrringfinancial responsibility to the Divisional Councils, . but the only alternative ic Voluntary Organisation. Wherever possible organisers should call extraordinary .Management Committee Meetings to deal.with the, situation, and I am confident that the stronger . Divisions can pull through.     As for the weakerDivisions, where it will be urged that full Divisional responsibility - is, impossible, the selecting of voluntary organisers should be proceeded with in anticipation of .  no further^ assistance from the Centre.&quot;The Commission has requested all branches to send in full details of their activities:   some of the questions are.;.-have remained at work:    the attitude of the looked-out men inDalmuir ia becoming-menacing:     it ia thought that there may beabotage and inoendiarisra in these districts.     Threatenedeviotiona in Dalmuir have caused much ill feeling. COMMUNISTS. -   &apos;: &apos;: &apos;?      &apos;: ;

THE &quot;UNITED FRONT&quot;.On May 3rd the following secret circular was sont to communist branches:   it is an interesting example of oommuni&apos; mentality:-&apos;SPECIFIC/
the Conference held at StoPancras Town Hall,. .on the 18th and 19th iroh having endorsed tho tactic of affiliation to the Labour Party the principle of working with and in the trade unions, declares its jrt of the following methods and measures for securing the realisa-of a united working class front.The CP. officially denies the charge that it desires to enter the Labour Party &apos;*&apos;merely to disrupt it&apos; and declares that it seeks affiliation in order to secure the political unity of the wort-king class and to influence the Labour Party in the direction of com-communism.The CP. holds that the immediate circumstances of the working class struggle of today demand the securing of the defeat at the polls Of the nominees of the avowed capitalist parties, and to this end is prepared to give general support to the Labour Party, while at the same time reserving the right of the CP. to critioise and op-pose the election programme and policy of the Labour Party whenever it tends to support the interests of reaction rather than the in-terests of the working class.The CcP. holds it to be its duty-to devote its energies to unsparing attacks upon capitalism end the capitalist parties.     It repudiates the suggestion that its tactics are designed with an end to dis-ruption and tho assertion that its propaganda is merely a vehicle for offensive attacks upon individuals.     It affirms on the contrary that it has one end anly - the creation of working class solidarity in struggle and is willing to give frank fraternal recognition to every effort of bona-fide working olass organisations to seoure that end.Tho CP, seekB to gain the oonfidence of tho masses by approaching the workers in our propaganda campaigns in the most sympathetic manner, and hy members of tho party assuming positions of respen-. sibility and undertaking the defenoe of the working olass on every issue large and small affecting working class welfare.The CP. believing that in some cases its members could with advan-tage to the Party Ve active as individual members of the Labour Party, draws attention to Clause 12 in its constitution which permits such membership subjeot to the approval of the Branoh, divisional council and Executive Coirmittee.The CP. declares its willingness at any time to enter into any con-ferance or negotiations between working olass parties that have for their object the consolidation ef the working class movement, no matter whether these conferences or negotiations be initiated by Right or Loft sections.To show its good faith the Oonferenoe instructs the executive to seek methods of approaching working olass organisations of this country, including:- the I.L.P., S.L.P., Anarchists, Left Wing and Ant ^Parliamentarian Communists, S.D.F., Fabian Society, the Labour Party, StP.G.B.* eto3 to put beforo thorn the proposals of the United Front.     Further, it instructs them to draw up the points in whioh tho invitation to a united front will be made in accordance with the general resolution already adopted.Further that this Conference, meeting at a moment when the attaok of tho employers on the working class is oonoentrated on tho engi-neoring factor, declares itself in complete solidarity with, the engineers in their struggle and iristruots&apos;the Executive Committee to apply the principle of the united fron thesis to the present lock-eut, with a view to strengthening tho resistance of this Bector of the working olass front.&quot;COMMUNISTS/&quot;SPECIFIC APPLICATIONS. OF THE PRINCIPLES OF THE UNITED FRONT.
COMMUNISTS IN THE SOOTH WAIVES COALFIELDThe Chief Constable, Cardiff, informs me that on May 6th delegates from the .85 branches of the Communist Party in South Wales and from oommunist nuclei in the ooalfield attended a conference in Cardiff:   R.H. Ley of Newport presided: and J.R. Wilson the divisional organiser was present:   the following resolutions were passed:-&quot;Resolved that we take steps to secure 100$ organisation of miners in the coalfield, on strict industrial lines of one union for the South Wales coalfield, affiliated to the M.F.G.B. to solve the problem of non-unionism, and craft unionism.&quot;&quot;In view of the deplorable state of trade in the coalfield we resolve to institute as a universal rule, for the coalfield that no new hand &apos; is to be taken on at any job, till old hand.are re-employed \ in order of seniority by grade. &apos; &apos; (b) Resolved to oppose by the advocacy of immediate f down tools any victimisation of workmen on score of age infirmity or industrial activities, however veiled with other managerial excuses,&quot;&quot;We resolve to oppose most strenuously the working of overtime as an insult and injury to the unionists now uneimployed- and working short time in the ooalfield.(b) We resolve to oppose the move now afoot by the owners to lengthen the working day from 7 to 8 hours I and as a coimtermove urge lodges to press for (1) The six hour day promised by Sankey.,,  (2v   A five day. a week policy.&quot;&quot;Resolved that all lodges of the S..W.M.F. be indirect contact v/ith their unemployed so that the unemployed miners may be utilised in show cards etc. to consolidate the ranks of the industrial organisati with a. view to united action when called, for, on beh.fi of either those, working, or, unemployed. &apos;That,we urge . . that the.&quot; members of the S.W.M.E. in compliance when S became unemployed shall be treated as-being in compli during pe r iod -:. of - unc ziployment, and shall be - given : . transfers clear, up to date of issue of transfers, further that all unemployed members-&apos; of. the. 3.W.M.F.. shall be treated:as&apos;ordinary working members&apos;in everyl respect, including right of representation, and candidature to all positions attached to the Pederatij- &quot;Resolved that we go the whole hog for the Holm^ Gregory Report as the minimum demands in regard to compensation. &quot;&quot;Resolved in view of tho widespread. dissatisfactl with the present wages agreement this Conference, urgel
all CP. Industrial nuclei to see to it that the necessary three months notice is given so as to ensure the agreement terminating on December 31st, 1922.     And further ask all O.P. Industrial nuclei groups to prepare suggestions for a new agreement .to operate forthwith after December Slst, 19$2.&quot; &apos;&quot;Resolved to use every effort to maintain all customs favourable to the workers relating to hours, and conditions, of work, or payments, of allowances and bonus&apos;s etc. whether.introduced before or after the 1915 Agreement, and operating;at looal collieries, Districts or the Coalfield generally.1&apos;&quot;Resolved as a counterblast to the reactionary General Counoil of the trade Union Congress we urge the formation of industrial nuclei in every organisation to proceed ultimately to establish a General Council of the Rank and Filo for South Wales.&quot;&quot;New Resolution. (1)   That we press for the affiliation of the S.W.M.F. to the .R.I.L.U. through the M.F.G.B. and if that is possible by direct affiliation.&quot;PD INTERNATIONAL &quot;OF LABOUR&quot; UNIONS&quot;On April 21st Losovsky sent the following Interesting communication to Watkins and Pollittf&quot;Your letter of the 5th inst. to hand.   The materials which you ask I will send you on immediately.   It has been delayed because one comrade was about to leave for England and we thought of sending through him the corresponding materials, but, evidently, he has been detained somewhere and we shall take all steps&apos; i,n order to forward you the. material as quickly as possible.&quot;We gather from the letter reoeived, received not long ago from Comrade Pollitt that the position in England is quite favourable for the development of the work of the Profintern.   We have taken this into consideration and in the instructions given to our comrade we have drawn the attention to the favourable situation for the work in your country.&quot;The basic question is the publication of agitation and propaganda literature.   Upto the present, besides your organ and resolutions, issued under the/name &quot;New Charter of Labour&quot; and a few small pamphlets, nothing has been published.   The &quot;Program of Aotion&quot; which has appeared in Frenoh, German, Czeohoslovakian and Italian languages has not been published either.   This &quot;Program of Action&quot; I have written for the express purpose of e;rplaining the program adopted at the First Congros3 of the Revolutionary Trade Unions.   It would be desirable to have the pamphlet published as quickly as possible,&apos;   What do you think of publishing our central organ - &quot;The Rod Labour Union&apos; International?&quot;   It would also be desirable to have it published regularly.&quot;I am waiting for your detailed letter containing a report on the conflict in the metal industry.   Thebourgeoisie/1 etI
bourgeoisie has succeeded this time to break down the unity of the workers and split the various Unions of the Metal Workers.   The Trade Union leaders have bnoe more suffered defeat.   How many defeats is the English working c&apos;L*ss to suffer in order to understand the real advantage of industrial Unions on the one hand and the revolutionary! taotioB on the other?  The English Trade Unions obstinately do not Wish to understand this elementary idea, hut your bourgeoisie is a splendid teaoher.   It seen! from what is going on that it will teach them very soon to understand such things which the leaders do not wish to learn from us.   Life is the best teacher.&quot;&quot;DAILY HERALL&quot;On May 9th the Joint Committee representing the General Council of the Trade Union Congress and the EXeoutive Committeel of the National Labour Party decided to find the money sufficient to meet the estimated loss on the paper until the annual meetings of those bodies in June and September.   Given the present price, circulation and revenue, the loss on the paper during the next six months would be $50,000:   as the prioj1 is to be 2d. from Monday next, the revenue and the circulationwill probably drop.Interesting light is thrown on the crisis through whichthe paper-has passed by the following letter, written on May 51^by W.B. Ewer, the Foreign Editor, to Philips Prioe:-- &quot;I em afraid that there is very little room for doubt that the sDaily Herald&apos;, which has weathered so many crises, is now up against one which it is not going tl weather. .&quot;The position is this.&quot;As you know, last January the Labour Party and the T.U.C. agreed in principle to the proposal that the movement should take over the financial responsibility for and control of the paper.   Committees were axrpointed to work- out the details of transfer and the executives of the unions were asked whether they would agree to levy their members an amount which would more or less make up the estimated deficit.&quot;It was first arranged that the replies should bo in and the final decision taken by the ena of March.   Then this was postponed until the end of April.   Actually, the replies were not considered by the Council until the day before yesterday.&quot;The/
&quot;The figures were roughly two million three hundred thousand in favour of a levy (some of them with the( reservation that they would only levy themselves if everybody did), and nine hundred thousand against.   Another one million five hundred thousand had not replied because it was necessary, under their constitution, to submit suoh a-question either to a ballot of the members or to a delegate meating.spite of the fact that the returns from those lioh had replied showed a majority of 2*g- to 1,&quot;Inunions whiohthey could not face the prospect of. assuming financial responsibility for a paper, which at the moment is losing  2,000 a week,   They meet again next Tuesday to give the absolutely final decision, but I do not think there is one chan.ee in a thousand of their finding sufficient courage to ;      decide at the last minute In favour of going on.   If they decide against - and that as T say, is praotioally certain -to-night week (appropriately, on a Friday) we shall be :   working on the last number of the DAILY HERALD, whioh will appear, equally appropriately, on May 13th,.&quot;To-day, In preparation far what appears the inevitably, we all received our notice, and the formal purpose of this V &quot;letter&apos;is to give you equally notice.   It is not just a hollow form because, of course, we have certain assets and &quot;shall have a oertain revenue for some time after we cease publication.   We believe that those will suffice to pay all the staff the full&apos; amounts to which they, according to the custom ef the various branches, are entitled:   though, of . &apos;&apos;. .      course, it will not be possible to pay the whole amounts down straight away.. l&quot;&apos;   &apos; - .............. .;.&quot;I ought to add that there is a chance that the Council -will decide on Tuesday to start immediately a Sunday paper,&apos; but expenses on this will be out down to-the bone, and I do not think there is the slightest Chance that they would employ any foreign correspondents, though they might want to have a oertain amount of foreign stuff at.space rates. However, I do not imagine that they would be particularly anxious to have it from youl&quot;. ,jjEB INDEPENDENT LABOUR PARTYtlIn the current issue of &quot;The Labour Leader&quot; CharlesTrevelyan in an article entitled &quot;The Failure of Genoa and theOpportunity of Labour&quot; urges that the Labour Party should adoptthe following programme of &quot;Eight Points&quot; for the next elect ion:&quot;IJBTERNATIONAL   ;(1)      &quot;Unconditional recognition of the Russian Soviet Government.(2)      &quot;Withdrawal of the British Army from the Rhine.(3)      &quot;Revision of the Versailles Treaty by the League of Nations after the admission of Germany and Russia.(4)      &quot;A policy of immediate and considerable reduction of armaments by Great Britain as an example to the world.&quot;NATIONAL/
&quot;NAT ION aL(5)     &quot;Nationalisation of M5.nes and. the management of the industry by representatives of the community, who. will own tha coal&quot;, the- consumers who will use it, and the workers of hand and train who will produce it,(6)    &quot;Nationalisation of Railways, and the same^industrial demporaoy applied, to their management,(7)     &quot;Heavy taxation..,of land Values in place of the : -&quot;present rates, on. the, principle that the values of land are wholly created by the community.(8)    &quot;A levy on oapltal to wipe off a large part of thel war dept.&quot; ,Trevelyan states that the world, is tiring of the preseatj British, statesmen and asking labour &quot;what personalities it ca put forward of tested ability like Mr.Lloyd George, Mr,Churoh: and Lord Curzori, Hie reply of Labour should be: These cleyf men have failed, hopelessly and disastrously. New standards of -action are the need of the world today far more than a new set of intellectual athletes. In all ranks in Britain plentj of men of common sense .and practical ability are to be found needed. But no party exoept ours ia pledged to carry out great changes which contradict the principles and the practice) with which these olever men for four disastrous years have been tormenting the world.&quot;IRISH REVOLUTIONARY ACTIVITIES IN GREAT BRITAIN.The rounding up of the Republican Arms agents in the North of England oontinued during the week.     In addition to the eight men referred to last week important arrests have been ef footed at Jarrow, Dewsbury and Manchester including, at the last named place, J.L.Soanlon, vho is one of the ringleaders. So far 0&apos;Dalaigh of Liverpool has escaped although the local police have been hot. on his trail.    He is the only important member of the gang till at large.     Doouments found confirm the information that these men are acting for Liam Mellows, . Director of Purchases for Rory CConno^s Army.    Mellows is
a notorious irreoonciliable, who led the rebels in Galway in 1916 and subsequently eaoaped to America where he remained till after the Truce,    He is now one of the aotive spirits of de Valera^ party and was the first Editor of the &quot;Republio of Ireland&quot;.Art 0&apos;Brien and hie supporters in London are still on-endeavouring to swing the Irish Self-Determination League to the side of the Republic, although not quite so openly as heretofore:   a quiet but insiduous propaganda is being pushed at Gaelic League classes and similar gatherings, but, so far, is making very littlo headway.Here and there Branoh meetings of the I.S.D.L. continue but they arc lifeless, more social than political.     The funds of tho organisation are depleted ana there is a corres-ponding laok of enthusiasm on the part of those who were regarded as props of the Republican movement.     Supporters of the Froe State are more than holding their own.The struggle between Free Staters and Republicans for oontrol of the I.E.A. still goes on in Scotland.Robinson was unable to aoodmpany Charles Diamond and William Sims to Loohgelly, Fife, where they proceeded on the 29th April and met the officers of the 4th Battalion on Sunday 30th April and most of these men said they were pre-pared to support the Republican party and told Diamond and Sims that they had a good supply of ammunition and explosives. In this connection it is interesting to note that the Fife-shire Polioe reoently discovered an I.R.A. dump containing 100 lbs, of explosives and 4,200 detonators, part of whioh was stolon from a looal pit in Ootober last.The open Sinn Fein movement in Scotland, like the Irish Self-Dotermination League in England, is splitting.     InDundee/
Dundee the supporters of the Free State held a meeting in the Masonio Hall and deoided to Invite Miohael Collins to address a meeting there at an early date:   during the progress of the meeting it was quite apparent that a serious quarrel had arisen.    A school-teaoher named Patriot Joseph (VNeill, of 32, South Tay Streetp Dundeet an active supporter of de Valera was present and was told that men of his views should remain in Ireland.     This man is reported to have got ammunition sent to him hy post from Dundee to Co. Tyrone whoa on his holidays a short time ago.
