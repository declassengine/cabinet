(Sent 7.30 n.r.. 16th Harch 192^.) .(Circulatca^ by^ the Secretary of ^. State for the. ColoniesKb. 18?..   please rofe* to your telegrams ]voo.l63 and 175. Treaty with Iraq. Peisal*g attitude with which I rjst disappointed seems to show little appreciation of lengths to meet his wishes to which we have already gone.   We have offeree, to place our relations with him on the basis of a Treaty concluded inter pares by two sovereign states and we are prepared so to word preamble that all reference to mandatory authority is omitted. He is not satisfied with this and demands that mandate be formally abrogated.   We find it impossible to agree.to this. Insuperable international difficulties at this end would be raised by a communication to Allies and League of Nations in sense suggested in your telegram If o. 163.   It must be remembered that the right has been given to us to conclude Treaty with Peisal only by the existence of mandate,    Iraq would revert to status of conquered Ottoman territory if the mandate dis-appeared and the country&apos;s ultimate disposal could be deter-mined only by agreement between Allied Powers.   All legal claim to special position in Iraq on which, whole policy of Treaty depends would be forfeited, by Great Britain if mandate were abandoned.   We could no doubt enter into Treaty relations with the independent State of Iraq, if ana when, conclusion of peace with Turkey had legalised its independent status but rights acquired under such a Treaty could not be exclusive in character and any state entitled to most favoured notion treatment in Turkey could claim, them in equal degree.   These considerations should be placed before 3&apos;feisal anf it should be made clear to him that we are precluded from complying with
Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 4th April, 19 32.with his request for international reasons.    In all the circum-stances he would, in my opinion, he very ill advised to refuse Treaty in form offered &quot;by His Majesty&apos;s Government.    That the idea, of mandate may aibuse prejudice among less responsible elements of population I can understand, but I cannot believe that the permanent advantage of placing political rights of Iraq on firm foundation of guarantee of League of Hations can be a matter of indifference to Feisal and his advisers.   I see nothing for it but.to drop. Treaty negotiations altogether if however he adheres to his present position.   The regularisa-tion of status of Iraq with all.the disadvantages involved both to Iraq and ourselves would thus be indefinitely postponed. We should merely carry on under authority of draft mandate as at present.    In that event no formal communication to League of Nations about mandate at present stage would be made by His Majesty*s Government who would probably refrain pending further development of local situation from pressing actively for its issue.    Feisal should clearly understand that his choice lies between these alternatives..It is of course possible to add a third to the above alternatives viz. that we should drop both Treaty and mandate and evacuate Iraq forthwith.   That Feisal would wish to bring matters to this point is to my mind scarcely credible but should I prove wrong about this and should Feisal show any disposition to favour our evacuation a wholly new situation which will have to be very carefully considered by His MajestyTs Government will have arisen.   I do not entirely dismiss this contingency from my mind.  ..I suggest that Feisal should plade the whole issue fairly before his Council of State and seek their advice before coming to a decision on a matter of siuch vital importance.
