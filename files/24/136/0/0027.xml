- ..     -   -. &amp;        141(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY .02; HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)secret cabinet.CP. 59S7.- -&quot; -EPIDEMIC IN RUSSIA.Copy of letter addressed to the &quot;Prime Minister by Sir Alfred Mond.4th April 1932.My dear Prime Minister,I have reoeived a Report j of which the following are the main points, of most vital importance from Colonel S.f.James of my Department, who has been acting as Official Delegate to the International Health Conference at Warsaw, and who has just returned.     Its bearing on the position of Russia and the question of Russian reconstruction, as well as the importance of guarding the future security of Europe against devastation by epidemic, is of. so important a character that I intend to circulate the Report as a whole.As, however., it is necessarily a lengthy document I at present confine my remarks to the most salient points....  The information regarding the situation in the interior of Russia, comes from first-hand sources, such as Professor Muhlens of the German..Red Cross Mission, who had just returned from a tour of inspection in the Volga .region,  and DR. W.E.Haigh of the British Relief Organisation for Russia, who had just returned from a tour.in the Ukraine,     The official -delegations from.the Russian Socialistic Soviet Federation and from the Ukraine also furnished detailed reports and. personal assistance.The Cojaference was naturally mainly occupied with the, question of the prevention of the spread of Typhus,. Cholera and other epidemics which are raging in &quot;the interior of Russia be yond the confines. .of that country.     In order to deal with this
subject it had to examine to the best of its capacity the &apos; conditions in Ruaais. itself,        the position as stated by the Russian delegates, shows that&apos; the state of that country is infinitely worse than any report so. far has over iaaio&amp;ted.It v*as unfortunately&quot; not possible to obtain permission for members of the cor-f^ronoe, to. proceed beyond \ hj&apos; Polish frontier;   but reports irom.Professor Muhlens jjnd Pr-IL-igh, ana information cot- unioatsd by the Pus a ion delegates segued to show show thit.the situation is much graver tbt-.n available statistics indieu,fe. .. The Uhr-vhian delegate stated that the statistics&apos; of typhus ; and cholera.- in the Ukraine for 19^:1 &apos; (540&apos;., 000&quot; e:-.Vea) should-vt least be doubled, t.n.u thut in vieVof &apos;he&apos; &quot;access&apos; of&apos;&apos;&quot; Cholera in January he anticipated at least&apos; 2&quot;,000&apos;,000&apos; cases of epiaemic&apos;: decease during the present ytar.&apos;   - Owing to&quot; transport &apos; difficulties only.a proportion of. those Cases can be&apos;brought to &quot;hospitals&apos;., but -.ver. for these the existing hospital&apos; c-ccomnib-dation is deficient by about 75,000 beds. &quot;  &apos; &quot;   &apos;&quot;&apos;&quot;    :-The following-are. some notes wbstrao ted &quot;from&apos; recent medical reports of-Black Sea ports arid other   localities- in the Ukraine famine - a one;   -in the city of Odessa the births&quot; in&apos; 1914 averaged ever 1,000 per month, but in January 1938 they Were only 180 and in February 147. .... Tin-;, deaths during those months wore 2,038 and -2,716 respectively:.as, compared with, a &quot;&quot;monthly average of about&quot; 900 in 1914.: . .. During the first t/eek in lSar.cn&apos;&quot;this&apos; year between 15-20 deaths were, occurring daily&apos; and--the dead mre seen lying&quot; - in the. -&quot;streets .of-the suburbs and. he aped&quot; in. the &apos; churchyards-; The: canalisation, system- and. the. city waterworks &quot;were&quot; out of&quot; action and&apos;&quot;water had to- b,e,bought...from street -vendors.   &apos; &quot;Shipping was- at a standstill,..Typhus., fever was increasing&apos; and.&quot;outbreaks &quot;of &quot;131 ague and- cholera were expected during the present year.-     Some of the ho spit al.- ;per so,nriel: ha d -air e ady died from   s tarvati on&apos; I n &apos;&quot;&apos; Tckaterynoslav conditions were found to be such&apos;that &apos; the&quot;&apos;dead lay -
nnburied- for two weeks and were then burled many,together-in shallowgraves where the dogs got at them,  : Most of the ho*s? itals. had &quot;teenobliged to close owing chiefly to lack of food- and fuel.     Malariawas prevalent.and three fatal cases of cholera (confirmedbacteriologioally) occurred in March this year..     fflcholaye-v andCherson were.-found to be very gravely smitten by famine andepidemic: diseases, and. the death rate among famine victims was fsported to be&apos; 50%.   .-alt. was said, that the - condition of taechildren collected in-houses was terrible..&apos;. I-.wish to. draw attention to the fact that the area involved is.not the famine-stricken district: of the volga but of theUkraine, about which little has been said so far in this country, and.which includes the Bladi Sea ports like Odessa and spreadsfrom.:there in a line conterminous .with the Polish frontier.. 1.-Following from thifl tbe sanitary defence &quot;between Russia &amp;n&amp; Pol and.&apos;: was - found -to have b-r oken do wn..7.The westward spread of epidemic diseases which&apos; -has been anticipated -is taking place.     Every town and &apos; village &apos; visited by the delegates, in Poland have eases of typhus and relapsing tev&amp;s,, andwhen. the..cholera.epidemic recommencesas it is bound&apos; to do in the summer months- there.ia.every reason to - anticipate that this will.spread too.::: J-repoattextual/ly some of the conditions in Russia itself, The report shows; an.entire disorganisation of the country and the&apos; ..incapacity of: the Russian. -Government to effect - any control over the infected population.&apos; The .impOBsibility:-is.,. apparent : of. stopping these-epidemics, spreading over Europe..:;and:-baaoming a. terrible menace to the whole&apos; --Civilisation.and evenaexistenee-;by.-merely attempting to- -deal with them;by. frontier sanitary -cordons.... - &apos;.&quot; If -this - is the only . possible ty. of dealing with- the matter, -very large summon -of money, -much
larger than have been devoted to this problem in the past. -&apos; and-much greater organisation will- have to be created;    and. it appears to me that this probably will have to be done in any event&quot;..But,, the real root of the- matter it; the interior of -F.rf.els.., As long as. Russia, consists&apos; of a&apos;&apos;diseaee--atrichen population., fleeing in all &quot;directions for edcape,&quot; without any control; and for an u-nl-1 mi ted period of time, the&apos;problem of uinply endeavouring to cheek this movement by r^re precaution;... tie emu likely to prove entirely ineffectuald - -In his conclusions,. Colonel Janen is of the opinion that no economic reconstruction &quot;can he  possible in Run ui a while the.-)..; population, in unheard of numbers. are dying of famine and disease or&apos;-&apos;engaged in a -panic-stricken flight., hither and thither,. spreading terror &quot;and infection&apos;-throughout the country.     The existing conditions of- epidemic diseases have paralysed all activity except the. attempt to escape death, &apos; a.- ..&apos; These coniltioha must be well-known to the Soviet representatives who are&apos; coming &quot;to Genoa, who must fully realise that they must come t.o-\Sb^:&apos;ar&apos;rah&apos;gera3-ht-&apos;-w-i&apos;th--&apos;Eu&apos;ro&apos;pe&quot;an Powers to save their country from destruction, -&apos;&apos; Ho- doubt they have&quot;&apos; endeavoured to conceal- to the best of..their---a&apos;oV lity- the actual conditions cf the country, and will continue to-bluff (which is&apos; one of&quot; their great assets, and vision.is taken too seriously in this country) &quot;always to the end5    and if it is made clear-to them that we are&quot; well aware of .the desperate plight . they. ;air.e .-,in/. and. that-.; only the combined efforts of European medicine, medical-:appli-anbe;sd----&apos;and; really prevent their countrybee on in g a depopulated wilderness, I feel convinced that a great many of the eponomic questions uhich, after all; duet be secondary to the -primary, question .of existence, can&apos; be colved.    -  &apos;  -&apos; &apos;   &quot;.0n the other hand- ,the conditions disc us t-ed appear to- m lie It even. o.f much greater importance to -arrive at. some- relations with -Puss la-, which., will enable Europe-to-assist in the country itself-4-
