(Ci r,culhte&amp; by the Secretary of State for &apos; War1.   In spite of persistent rumours to the contrary Easter week-end has passed in Ireland comparatively quietly-and nothing in the nature of a Coup d&apos;Etat or Declaration of a Republic has taken place.In DUBLI17 on the night of the 13th/l4th Republican forces seized the Pour Courts and are still in occupation, the windows being barricaded with sandbags, books and furniture. The same night several other buildings, including Jacob*s Biscuit Factory, were reported to be occupied by republicans, but these were all vacated by-morning, and it was found that in most cases the temporary occupation had been for the purpose of commandeering foodstuffs.   The explanation given.by Roderick (Rory) 0&apos;*Connor for the occupation of the Pour. Courts1 was that he required accommodation for his   troops&quot;, and that there was -no intention of proclaiming a Republic or effecting a Coup d&apos; Etat.    It is obvious however that the continued occupation of these Law Courts by mutinous troops must, after the Easter holidays, interfere with the administration of the law and seriously embarrass the provisional Government.The attitude adopted by Mr. Michael Collins and his Ministry has, so far, been to ignore the republicans unless actually attacked.    It is-believed that the provisional Government have some 2200 men (oxclusive of civic guards) armed and more or less trained in DUBLIN, and that during this week-end, including detachments which have arrived from. England and from the South West,  the Republicans have had ab;.-u I 4000 menjj armed with a variety of weapons and indifferertly trained.-Several important buildings have been occupied - during the week-end. by provisional Government forces.The chief danger to be feared, from the republican forces is interference with British Troops, a line which might be deliberately adopted in order to provoke us to take seme action, which might tend to draw the provisional Government troops and republican forces together against a. common enemy.-   while every effort- is being made to avoid such an occurrence,-and while all commanders are fully alive to the danger of being drawn Into such-a situation, it is probably quite clear to the republican Iforces, from the preparations ,.the t have been made- that British, troops if at-tackec. wi-11 fire back in self defence.   This will it is hoped have the desired effect of maintaining peace, as. -the republicans have no wish to suffer casualties.   As regards the initiation of action against repot]loans it is obvious that this is a matter for the provisional Government and not for Imperial frcops.On/E 0 RET. ^J3 43^
On Saturday morning a party of Republican t&apos;i-*       occupied Kilmainham jail, which had been evacuated by us some months ago,/ but had never been actually taken over by the Provisional Government.   This constituted a grave menace to the British forces, as the jail is situated just outside the Royal Hospital and. between that building and Richmond Barro.cks and Island Bridge.   Fortunately the republicans had omitted to occupy the Court House, a strongly built structure which is situated to the East and outside the walls of the jail, and between it and the Royal Hospitals   As a precautionary measure and in order to prevent its occupation by Republicans, the Court House was quietly taken over about midday yesterday (18th) by a party of the King&apos;b Shropshire Light Infantry, who will remain ir-occupation until such time as the provisional Government are prepared to take the building over.2.   The meetings addressed by fcr. Griffiths at SLIGO and Sr. Collins at ITAAS both passed off comparatively quietly, and the courage shown by these two gentlemen cannot fail to have a good effect.   In contrast to this stands Kr. de valorass Easter message, which, though it may rouse a spirit of militancy in the youth of both sexes and in the hooligan classes, cannot fail to disgust the more law-abiding people, and tell against the republican party at the forthcoming elections, should they take place.3.   There has been an improvement in Northern Ireland, during the period under review.   This improvement is ascribed partly to the good general effect of the spirit of tine recent agreement, partly to the activity of the northern police Forces in pursuing every trace of the I.R.A. and partly to the dissension reigning in the higher circles of the I.R.A. in Southern Ireland,The situation on the Border has also been quieter owing to the cessation of I.R.A, activity at the old points of friction (3URH&apos;S BRIDGE and LACKY BRIDGE).   This quistress may however be due to dissension in the ranks of the local *R * A. .4.   BELFAST, with the exception of the outbreak on 13th and consequent reprisals on 14th has been quieter.The casualties for the week (11th - 17th April) being:-Killed... Wounded.Protestants 2 5Roman Catholics 2 5Police - 6Military -TOTAL 4 16The worst and most misleading feature of the situation is the exaggeration of incidents both in the North and South by the press.5.    On 12th April at EIHGSTOwlI an attempt to murder the-escort of a military car was made by civilians.   The man (pte. Taylor) though shot through the head is still alive. (18th April)..6.    On the afternoon of 14th April a military car which was passing the FOUR COURTS was stopped by another car containing- 2 - armed/
armed men in,plain clothe.?, in front of it, the escort was hold up and deprived of his revolver.   There is nothing to show that this action was initiated by the Republican forces in the Four Courts.An attempt was made to hold up another military car in another prrrt of DUBLIN hut without success, the escort to the driver being slightly, wounded.7,     The boycott of Belfast goods still continues and large quantities are removed from trains and goods stations in Southern Ireland daily.   Cases have also occurred where goods from England have been similarly treatedo8.     Since my last report the following moves have taken place(a) On 11th April, the 1st Bn. prince of Wales&apos;s Volunteers moved from DUBLIN to BELFAST in relief of the 4th Bn. Worcestershire Regt. which is being disbanded.   The surplus personnel of the iatter Regiment has- joined the 2nd Bn. Worcestershire Regt. in Dublin.(b) On 12th April, 2nd K.S.L.I. moved from the CURRAGH to DUBLIN and has been allotted to 25th provisional Infantry Brigade.(o) On 15th Aoril, 33rd Brigade R.F.A   (less 33rd Battery) moved from DUHDAJX to COLLINSTOv/N (DUBLIN) *(d)   The evacuation of the women and children of the regiments remaining has been continued.9.    &quot;SELLIFITON Barracks (DUBLIN) and the barracks at TALLAGI1T, BUNDALK. and KILDARE have been handed over to the Representatives of the provisional Government.(Sgd.)
