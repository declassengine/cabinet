THE COMMUNISTSThe Party Commission is meeting regularly at 16, King Street and held its fifth session on April 17th: finance has &quot;been so far the principal subject of discussion: the Commission has assumed that the &quot;paid up&quot; membership of the Party is 2,400:    this figure gives an income to headquarters from subscriptions of  30 per week, as against a wages hill, for &quot;overground&quot; offioials alone, of over  180 per week.     The Commission has called for details of the money spent on underground organisation and on the secret press in Scotland as well as on the Information, Electoral and Educational Departments and &quot;delegations abroad&quot;.   Reports on the work of the C omni3sion.   are being forwarded to the Third   International.R. Palme Putt, the chairman of the Commission, has requested Saklatvala to procure full details of the income and expenditure, subscription rates and staff of the Independent Lahour Party and- all particulars relating to &quot;The Labour Leader&quot;, as a guide for the re-organisation of the Communist Party.Palme Putt is devoting some attention to London &quot;branchesand has sent to E.W. Cant the following draft letter, which relates, in effect, to the formation of nuclei or germ cells:&quot;A scheme has been prepared hy the Theses Sub-Committee set up by the last Divisional Council for the organisation under the London District Committee of the training of party members in the   London area.&quot;For this purpose a Central Instruction Group will first be formed of twelve active members from different parts of London.   These will first themselves go through a course of training in the party programme and party work.   They will then go out as instructors to train similar groups in their locality.,&quot;The names for this Central Group must be carefully chosen from active comrades who will he able to profit from the course and take a leading partin/
in their locality on their return.&quot;For this purpose we are inviting some of the best and most active branches in different parts of the London area each to nominate one member.     Your branch is one of those selected.&quot;Please send your nomination direct to. me. It is important that the member chosen should be prepared and undertake the obligations of the course i respect of time and work, and be able to make his training of use to his locality on its completion. This is not a study class.- but a group for practical party training, and this Central Group is to be a group of future instructors and local organisers.&quot;Cant has, however, decided that the matter is so&quot;confidential&quot; that he will only discuss it with chosenmembers at the office.London members have been instructed to:1.   Join a trade union;2.    Join the local Labour   Party;3.    Join the organised unemployed if out of work. Members failing to comply are to be reported, as it will be assumed that they&quot;do not intend to give effect to the decisions made by the Policy Conference.&quot;Divisional Sub-Committees to assist the Commission ei being formed in the provinces: John E. Clarke, editor of &quot;The Worker&quot;, has consented to act on the v&apos;est of Scotlanc Committee and J.E. Campbell has also been asked to join.A letter, dated March 9th end believed to have beensent by Karl Badek to a   Labour representative in this  .country, indicates the dissatisfaction of the ThirdInternational with communist activities in this country:&quot;The indulgence displayed by you towards the . Labour Party makes one believe that the general tendency towards compromise which is being observed -   in Central   Europe, has also Infected, you and your friends in England.   You did not. avail yourselves in the slightest&quot;of the Anglo-Irish conflict in order t occupy, at least in Ireland, the position which you could occupy...       1   .&quot;At present your party is negotiating with the Labour Party for the inclusion of the British Commun is t Party in. a united&apos; Labour -Party.&apos;   You will &quot;be undoubtedly offered a compromise, some means to reconcile the .irreconcilabler.&apos; . The Central ExeoutiTiCommittee/
Committee is unable to comprehend how your party, which accepted the 21 points ana affiliated itself to the Third International, could open these negotiations, whatever the considerations are hy which, you are guided, in order to re-affiliate yourselves to .the Labour Party. Could you not continue your independent acti?ities and existence without placing yourselves under the guardianship of the &quot;conciliatory7&apos; leaders of the I.P.? If that is the way you have interpreted the me suing of a *united front&apos; then I hasten to iolovm you that your interpretation is entirely wrong and If it is put into practice will be simply detrimental and dangerous both to your party and to the entire Third International, You justify yourselves by stating that you hare at your disposal only 30,000 votes of the o:v?aai3scl workers, and that you cannot build on the organisations of unemployed as the latter are out merely for their own personal interests and will Bupport those who will pay the most.   You also said that for tactical reasons the British Communist Party must avail itself of the pending elections for propaganda and agitation purposes.. The Central Committee having also carefully discussed your own report and the report of your liaison Service in London, has unanimously decided to suggest to you that in the future you should be guided by the following principles:1.     The British Communist Party affiliates itself to the Labour Party as a completely independent unit and subordinates itself to the L.P. . exclusively in matters of professional policy.2.     The British Communist Party retains completely its internal structure and organisation, its Treasury, its Liaison Services, and, particularly its agitation and propaganda system, which continues . to work quite independently of the Labour Party and everywhere, especially in. the provinces, i3 subordinated to its own responsible leaders.3.     The British Communist Party is permanentlyrepresented on the Central Committee of the Labour Party and -later stipulates for the right toorganise a separate section of the Executive of the Labour Party formed of representatives of groups, which in programme, views and. ideology are kindred to the   British Communist Party and the Third International.&quot;These are the three points from which you and your friends cannot depart without risking the loss of your place in the   Third.International and simultaneously .the loss of the latterrs moral and material support,.&quot;As regards tactics, you are granted complete independence of initiative as long as, you strictly adhere to our.instructions and you will receive the necessary material support in funds and relations.v*At the same time I inform you that the. Third International considers it its duty to remind you and the Executive of the British   Communist Party that the internal, situation in Ireland is at present much more favourable for the spreading and development of theactivities/
activities of yeur party than it has been during the last months.     The attainment of illusory independence places the Irish worker faoe to faae with a government of their own, to whiah they will undoubtedly put a series of demands entirely opposed to the petty bourgeois regime which is the dream of the Irish Nationalists.     In any case it is your duty to create a favourable atmosphere.for the putting forward of such demands although the Central Committe is convinced that life itself will do this purely mechanically.-.&quot;The Communist International is convinced that Ireland will form the breach through which the revolutionary movement will penetrate into England and raise the^masses of unemployed the organisation whom you undertook last year.to organise but whom unfortunately you have not succeeded in utilising.&quot;You are invited to prepare an approximate progri for the next few months and if this program is endorsed by the Communist International, ,the latter ...   promises you its support on a most generous scale with all funds and possibilities that are at our disposal.&quot;The Communist Party of Germany has sent a long communication to the Executive of the British Communist Party in whioh the efforts of the former to assist in the formation of a &quot;United Front&quot; are detailed: the writers suggest that there shall be a regular interchange of reports between the two parties, particularly in regard to the steps taken to give effect to the decisions of the recent Berlin Conference of the three.Internationals.The information, given in last week*s report, to theeffect that the Communist Party has received instructionsits activities not to advertise/during the Genoa Conference, has been confirmed.Arthur MacManus has been asked by G.S. Para, tb eeditor of &quot;Hind&quot; and the honorary secretly of theBharat Conference to attend the Second Session of that body on April 29th: the following are sgoc of theresolutions which will be considered by the conference:&quot;This Conference sends its hearty and sincere good wishes to the people of Ireland for the v. attainment of their natural desire for complete freedom from external control.&quot;Thifl,
s -310&quot;This 0onfrr-ence- greatly-^Leplores the auf^ring that is now-aaused to millions of human-,beings all over Europe, by the imperialist ambitious of thegoverning classes of certain Western nations, ana holds the firm belief that the regeneration of Europe, and re-establishment of peaoe and eoonomio stability in the west are impossible until the nations of Asia and Africa are completely free and independent national groups, entering into voluntary eoonomio international relationships amongst themselves and with the nations of the West; and this Conference emphatically denounces as barbaric and savage the desire of any nation to control the political, social or economic life of another nation under any pretence whatever, and refuses to admit thesanction of civilisation or humanity to such international dominations.&quot;This Conference declares itself in favour of rights of the workers the producers of wealth in all parts of the world to be the ruling and dominant factor in their own countries.&quot;This Conferenoe urges the Committee of the Indian National Congress to consider the necessity of maintaining political and social activities of the Indian community in Great Britain, just as the Irish are maintaining the Self-determination movement in Great Britain, while the self-imposed control of Britain over India lasts.&quot;This Conferenoe expresses its unabated confidence in   Mahatma Gandhi and the other leaders and workers in India who are engaged in the struggle for Swaraj and renews the expression of its determination to support them by every means possible.&quot;Chaman Lai, General Secretary of the All Irdiar:Trade Union Congress, has informed Saklatrala that he iscollecting donations for his parliamentary contest inBattersea: Lai has also asked that Palme Iftitt shall ,send him the Labour Monthly regularly.The Communist Party is endeavouring to push on theorganisation of Women1s Groups and the visit of a &quot;comradefrom Berlin&quot; is expected in the near future: Harry Webb, Inhis capacity of acting national organiser, Is at the headof affairs and his immediate assistants are Helen Crawfurd,Mary Mporhouse, Miianae   Birch, Mrs. Thomas, Mrs. Thring,Miss Sanders, Mrs. Horrabin, Ellen Wilkinson, and Cedar Paul:Helen Crawfurd considers that the jute workers in Dundeeand the cotton operatives in Lancashire would afford the moatprofitable field for propaganda, but it is unlikely that much will be done until, the Party Commission has decided whatfunds/
funds are available for the work.     The Executive has agfrefcd to allocate space in rtThe Communist&quot; to propaganda for women once a month.     Minnie Birch, seoretary of the Women1s Organising Committee for London and the Home. Counties, ha3 circulated a scheme for work in labour, Co-operative, Trade Union end Unemployed organisations and h&amp;s urged members to secure indirect representation of the Communist Party at the National Conference of Labi Women in Leamington on May 9th and 10th: a series of &quot;Study Group&quot; meetings is also to be inaugurated in LonditoA communist organisation in Mannheim has offered Edgar Whitehead sets of Russian postage stamps, to be ao for the benefit of the Pamine Pund: these stamps are apparently already on sale in Germany and Switzerland.THE UNEMPLOYEDProm the reports received it would appear that the enthusiasm of the unemployed for frequent demonstrations is waning: there are nevertheless signs of activity in some centres, notably Coventry, Edinburgh and SunderlanJOn April 21st communist members of the Southwark Unemployed were forcibly ejected from premises seized in the Old Kent Road, the police acting on the instructi of the trustees.The Chief Constable of Coventry informs me that on April 21st about 150 unemployed demonstrated outside tW Swift Motor Works, where it was stated that men were working overtime. A deputation of four, including Jack Leekie, was admitted and after arrangements&apos; had been m&amp;d for the deputation to meet the management on the foil owl day the orowd dispersed. Leckie and TPom Dingley are taking a very active interest in the Engineers&apos; strike j it seems possible that   they    will cause trouble in tinnear/
near future, should a suitable opportunity occur.   OnApril 25th for instance, on the occasion of a demonstrationto the Municipal Buildings, in which between 700 and 800 Dingley said,men participated: /&quot;I have a whistle and I blow once for halt and when I blow twice follow me and ask no questions.&quot; About 800 unemployed demonstrated outside the London Load Institution, where a deputation was being received by the Guardians, on the previous day, but on neither occasion was there disorder.The Chief Constable of Sunderland informs me that strenuous efforts have been made by local communists to unite the looked-out engineers, shipyard workers and unemployed and that the extremist unemployed committee usually draws a crowd of about 5 00.It is possible that the   Unemployed movement in Scotland may receive impetus from the recent conference in Edinburgh, which has appointed Blantyre, chairman of the Divisional Council;    Carr, of Glasgow, secretary; and Currie of Dumfries delegate to the National Administrative Council meeting in London on April  8th and 29th.   The response of the unemployed in Edinburgh does not appear commensurate with the efforts of their leaders.     The Chief Constable of Edinburgh informs me that on April 19th about 80 unemployed marched to the Free Guardians&apos; Hall, in which the Conference of the Scottish Trades Union Congress was being held, and overcrowded the gallery.     A deputation of the unemployed was allowed to address the Conference and put forward claims that were in effect, those of the Rational Administrative Council of Unemployed.MAY DAYLabour, Trade Union and Communist organisations are marshalling their speakers for May  Day and making generalpreparations/
preparations for meetings&apos; and processions in London end the provinces:   in view of the large number of unemploye It is possible that the meetings will be well attended i some distriets, but there are no signs that men in work will &quot;down tools&quot; if meetings are held on May 1st:   in many places the celebrations will take place on April 30 or May 7th.   A special 16-page Issue of the   Communist&quot; be published and the &quot;Communist Review&quot; will contain &quot;th full inner story for the first time in English of the revolt of the French Fleet in the Black Sea during 1919, The Profintern has issued a Manifesto &quot;to the worker of all countries&quot; calling upon them to down tools on Maj Day.THE YOUNG COMMUNIST LEAGUEFrom March I8th - 29th a &quot;Bureau Session&quot; of the Young Communist International was held,in-Moscow, at whi , delegates are reported to have been present from Austria Czecho-Slovakia, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Ital Latvia, Norway, Poland, Russia, Sweden, Switzerland and Yugo-Slavia.   England and America were unable to send representatives, but despite this, fact, considerable attention appears to have been paid to -the&apos; movement In t country:    it was decided that special attention must be paid to organisations such as the Y.M.C.A., Y.W.C.A., M Scouts, Girl Guides ana   Churoh Lads&apos; Brigade ana effor made to rope their members into the Young Conmunlst League.    It was also agreed that attempts should be madi segregate the young workers who belong to &quot;bourgeois spo olubs&quot;, to adapt the literature &quot;to the needs and psychology of the working youth&quot; and to inaugurate elementary educational o-u/ses.   Various theses were accepted/
accepted &quot;by the conference.:*   &quot;William Carroll has been dismissed by the Young Communist League in consequence of financial difficulties: his work will.cease on April 28th and his present intention is to return .tp Glasgow.&apos; - -&quot;-&apos;:------ . *-f&apos; .. -. &apos;&apos; &quot;;    7fA REVOLUTIONARY HBYJEW OF THE LABOUR SlTUATIOH &apos; .&quot;&apos;r&quot; *The April -,May issue of the &quot;Labour&quot; Monthly contains an analysis, of..the labour situation and an exposition pf;extremist policy &quot;for the future which &quot;are worth ..j&quot;. &apos;&quot;&apos;.&apos;consideration in that, although emanating probably &quot;from., thepen of. R. Palme Putt, they represent; the opinion of sometrade union officials.-.&apos; v&quot;The policy-pf 1919, the policy v/hich produced .m -the Coal Commission, the Industrial Conference, &quot;and allthe other golden promises that ate now only a mocking , .memory, was a mistaken policy,&quot;as the.hard facts.have now shown.   But the.&apos;j?ssential characteristics, of; that policy- remain.    The. conditions which produced. Biapk Friday are still with us.   And in consequence tlie&apos;whole movement &quot;is at present going steadily,; doms   phe-time . powerful organisations like the: Miners have,sunk into weakness, and the Engineersi. are &quot;how:beginning , the same experience..   The movement&quot; is&apos; &apos;&amp;i &quot;present - at.&apos;a. deiad end, and groping vainly for a hew iine of progress.. Only in the electoral sphere.- i3 there still progress and hope of success:* J and- even: there we&apos;believe that-&apos;.the same dead point is Inevitably destined to be reached..   The reason -for this must he made, c^ear&apos;before there can,be &apos;.any hope of progress.   &apos; :-     -, .&apos;; &quot;- ..i - &quot;... The essential feature of : Black Friday- was this:the refusal of solidarity by the   Labour movement because of fears-of the.results of&apos; that solidarity. Labour still shrinks .from exerting its full-strength, as capital has never :shrunk::  arid ;&quot;tha&apos;t. is why -capital wins, and a.handful of men are able to impose their will on many millions.  --The leaders of Labour. still, suffer from a. divided allegiance:    they regard--themselves.&apos;.;as - ultimately &quot;responsible, not. to the &quot;&quot;movement they are leading, &quot;but td something else.    That-.something else -they.&quot; believe to. be the &apos; community^, and they^are afraid of hurting it:,   but in reality it is- Capitalism, and   1 . .      ^haf^ig the secret of their paralysis.   When a- dispute -    ;  ,-.-arises &quot;in one section,, the other sections hasten to.1\ &quot;mediate1&apos; on behalf of the something else. . By the very &quot;Use of that term&apos; 1 mediate&apos; &quot;they show&quot; ,.that-;th^y regatd J &apos; themselves&apos;?&apos; as ^neutrals, not as&apos;allies...- This was the story: of&apos; the ^railway&apos; strike :of 1919, when the other Unions hastened to form their Trade Union Mediation Committee of Fourteen,    it was the story-of-Black Friday when the &apos; alliesr of. the Triple Alliance conceived their i ) -   function to be to act.as, go-betweens with the enemy and :vk:;:.!-,.-. j v   leave the: miners to- suffer. ,alone. - It ife ,-again the -.,. story, to-day with the. :Gen.eral Council&apos;.-&apos;.&apos;.--.;
&quot;The General Council was created as a General Staff. i .) It is acting as a Mediating Committee.   The lock-out reveals once again in its most vivid form the essential    &quot; faota of the, situation...   At the- time., of .the delivery of the ultimatum the ..Amalgamated Engineering Union had 91,000 unemployed members hut of &quot;a tctal ;0,f. ,.406,000 and had paid out  2,000,000-in the preceding year in    -unemployment benefit.   Thus its funds were depleted before I the fight begani not by fighting or preparing for fighting I but by relieving the employers of; their burdens and helping to maintain capitalist industry..&apos;. The ultimatum.. falls first on the strongest, the A.E.U.The other unions look on waitings   The ultimatum to them&apos;--was duevtqj:M expire four days after that to the A.E.U., but it was postponed.   Not until the third week, at the moment chosen 1 by the employers, are the other Unions brotight in.   One at time is the policy of the employers.&apos; -One :at a, time, is&quot;&apos;the!I obedient policy of the Unions... ^ &apos; . 1&quot; * * * The General Council has accomplished what the /Ministry of Labour failed -to aooomplish - it has brought fm two sides together.    The assistance, of the General council I has effectively turned the A.E.U.. position.    The A.E.U. mafl fight Sir Allan Smith and Dr. Macnamara.* &quot; But how can they&apos;Ii fight Henderson and Bowermah?   The function of the -General J Council as the mediator - or, in other wards, the buffer oil Capitalism - is revealed.   And at the same time, to completlS the picture, is revealed the contrasting attitude of the Capitalists&apos; General Staff - the State...&quot;What is the moral of the situation?   In his articlelii in the current issue Mr. W.H. Hutchinson, Who may be regarded as the guiding spirit of the A.E.U., draws the moral that the General Ceuncil must be&apos; given more -effective powers.   It is a significant fact when one of the ablest   m officials of the old school recognises that the old Trade Unionism is at the end of its tether, and that its sectionalism is powerless against the combination and concentration of modern Capital...   The. more powers the General Council has, the less it will be: likely to use theffll What is needed is not simply power,&apos; but power for an objective.   What is that objective?   There can only be one I answer to that question.   If the central direction of Labour is needed to confront the central direction of Capital in the modern State, it can enly be for one purposel and that Is te defeat it.     But to defeat it is no longer.H an isolated struggle in a separate industry:   it is no longer a 3truggle in the merely industrial field at all.&quot; Every national dispute of the past few years has shown that! it is a struggle with the whole organised force&apos; of the modern capitalist State.     This is the issue which the medern Labour Movement has been brought up against during I the last few years, and has shrunk from facing.    From the I moment of that shrinking it has gone back, and begun to     U lose even its former gaiijs.&apos;&apos;      - - &apos; - .- - ; j&quot;...The swelling tide of by-election successes \ leads to the hope that Labour will find its solution jC^l the ballot,&apos; where the   Unions have failed.   This development may be&quot; expected to continue until a new disillusionment t following either on, the non-re turn of a-Labour&apos;Government to powel&quot; or * on its, return; - and renewed industrial struggles lead to the next swing:&apos;;of the-pendulum.% .ThV oldcontroversy/
controversy of 1 industrial&apos; and &quot;political1 action is out cf date, because the alternatives are unreal.    It is quite true that the modern struggle of Labour is political in the sense that it is a struggle for po.ver in the whole of society.    But this does not maan that it is merely electoral.    The failure to understand .this distinction -is the cause, of endless confusion.    1 Political1 means more than Parliamentary.   A political issue, is in the last r?sort one which affects the ultimate seat of power in sooiety.     And that ultimate seat of power is not Parliamentary. -  .,TThe development of the Labour   Party is a great stage in advance in so far as&apos; it represents the recognition that the modern .problam is political.   The modern Trade Union official recognises that he is faced with the problem of the State, and proposes to meet it by capturing the State by the ballot.   The old Trade Unionist who wishes te keep clear &amp;f ^olitios1 has practically disappeared.   This, is a tremendous &quot;advance, beoause it means that the controversy is now narrowed down to the method of &apos;capturing&apos; the State.   The day of economic Trade Unionism is over. But the fact, that economic Trade Unionism has now given plaoe to the stage of Parliamentary Trade Unionism does not mean that the stage of Parliamentary Trade Unionism is final.   The hopes of the Labour Party are now in the ascendent, and orthodox Trade Unionism on the down-grade, not because one is successful and  ihe other not, but because orthodox Trade   Unionism has been tried through to its finish, while the Labour Party has still t* be tried. But the experience of continental countries has already shown that when the Labour Party has reached a sufficient stage of development it will be faced with the same ultimate problem.   A Labour Government has to maintain law. and order, that is to say the   existing system.    Y^hen it tries to go beyond that, the real struggle awaits it.    If It does not so try, like the Labour Governments in Australia and Germany, the real struggle oonfronts the -Labour movement.    In either case the ultimate issue has to be faced, and every possible avenue of progress will reach the same dead point until it is faced.&quot;This is the lesson which is being proclaimed from every country.    The Rand provides the latest and. most startling example...   Conservative Trade Unionism and a moderate Labour Party give no guarantee of social peace. The lesson will have been stamped into the heart of every worker in Sotuh Africa.&quot;In India, again, an entirely different set of conditions has revealed the same underlying issue...   Like the Triple Alliance strike in this country, the great gun of the Indian movement of &quot;Mass civil disobedience&apos;, after being repeatedly threatened and repeatedly postponed,never went off.   Why was this? The fundamental reason was. :.....the same in each country.    In either case the leaders suddenly realised in the moment of crisis the inevitably revolutionary consequences of the policy they had proclaimed and drew back in alarm to the surprise and consternation of their followers.   Prom that moment the movement declined:    in this country the employers renewed their offensive;    in India the Government was able with impunity to sentence .Gandhi to six years&apos; imprisonments     The first period of the revolutionary prelude is completed:    thesecond/
second waits to begin.   The failure of Gandhi is the old story of the failure of the man who calls the masses into movement, but shrinks from the revolution consequences of a movement of the masses.&quot;W.H. Hutchinson, of the Amalgamated . Engineering Union, v/ho contributes an article on the &quot;Engineering Lock-out&quot; claims that Trade Union organisation in its present form has failed and that &quot;one more try&quot; must be made to improve it:     His plan is the consolidation of the &apos; unions in each of the seventeen groups comprising the General Council and the building up of a fighting fund: &quot;But if this one more try falls, there seems to me no-alternative to the &apos;0ne   Big Union&apos; form of organisation.&quot;THE RED INTERNATIONAL OF LABOUR unions on March 31st the Miners&apos; International Conmittee for Aotion and Propaganda requested   Tom Mann to send to Moscow:1.    &quot;All publications of the.Miners&apos; Federationperiodical reports for the&apos; current ten years, eto2.   &quot;Publications of the   English bureau of the Rea Labour Union International referring to theminers.3.   &quot;Publications of the Miners&apos; Union which areaffiliated to the Red Labour   Union International.4.    &quot;Copies of colleotive agreements of the Miners and addresses of separate Miners&apos; Unions the-majority of which are in favour of the Red Labour - 1 - &apos;      Union International or have, significantrevolutionary minorities.&quot; -:&apos;INDUSTRIAL WORKERS OF THE WORLD DEPORTEESHarry Feinberg, Secretary of the General Defence-Committee of the&apos; Industrial Workers of the World in ,-, Chicago has informed Sylvia Ptmkhurst that any alien member! of the Industrial Workers of the WOria deported from America are given $100 by that organisation and a suit by f Quakers when they leave the States.convictions/

Money, hitherto plentiful, is becoming aoaree o.ao:&quot;g them.   Many have lost their civil employment and the promises of &quot;good jobs&quot; held out to them have not materialised.   A deputation recently visited the Irish Self-DeteJsmiination League Headquarters in &apos; Shaf tesbury Avenue and demanded money, saying they &quot;would blow the place up&quot; if they did not get it.During the progress of a Concert, held under the auspices of the Paokham Branch,  Irish Self-Determination League, on April 17th, the opposing sections nearly came to blows and there are many other indications of an earlybreak-up/
1&quot;break-up of the organisation. Some of the London Branolfl have already closed down, among them the one atLewisham where the disturbance to which reference was made in last week&apos;s report occurred.   Others exist in name only.Closing down appears to be general in Liverpool, hitherto-the most active centre in. England;    the organisation is almost dead, five branches have definitely closed and others only meet occasionally: the average attendance has fallen from 40 to 12.Great efforts, are being made by the leaders to retain the League in an outwardly united form, but the cleavage which showed itself at the annual conference on April 1st is a serious one.Snail quantities of arms, etc., are still being procured by the &quot;Republican&quot; Irish Republican Army: in some cases, it is reported, from demobilised &quot;BlaciJ and Tans&quot;.     These purchases, it is said, are not authorised by the leaders but are the acts of Individ and it is not quite clear whether they are for shipmea to Ireland or for the use of extremists in this count! There is evidence that here and there advanced Iri3hoi in the Labour movement are throwing in their lot witty the communists.   On April 11th the principal speaker at the Communist meeting in Gorton Town Hall, Manchesterj was an Irishman named McKay, who is also Sinn Eeiner.A man named Leveney, evidently 8n Irishman, residing in the levenshulme district of Manchester, head of the Communist Cycle Corps, who meet at T/ari&apos;i,agtcn on the first Sunday in each month, -Mrsc Paarce - and Miss   Mary MoSwiney spoke at v&apos;\ClydobankB on April&quot; 3rd.   Miss   MoSwiney made a biattack on the Treaty and stigmatised those who sigflB -as trait ora cud wraklings. (
