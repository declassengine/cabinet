[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty &apos;s Government.] I(Printed fur the Cabinet.      April 1022.)SECRET.CP. 3920.&quot;CIRCULATED BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA.INDIAN BUDGET, 1922-23I. I desire to draw the attention of the Cabinet to the situation created in respect of the Indian Budget for 1922-23 by the rejection by the Legislature of a considerable portion of the proposals for taxation and the acquiescence of the Government of India in the rejection, which has resulted in a large uncovered deficit. In this note only the salient features of the position are described. Full particulars are given in the accompanying document.* In spite of large increases of taxation India has in the last four years suffered very heavy recurrent deficits, which, by March 1922, had accumulated to a total amount of 90 crores.j Of this amount 33 crores accrued in 1921-22, owing partly to a failure of revenue following on the trade slump and fall in exchange, and partly to increased cost of achninistra-tion. The latter increase was mainly military, and was largely attributable to frontier operations.2. For 1922-23 the Finance Member estimated that if the basis of taxation remained unchanged there would be a deficit of 31   crores. To meet this he proposed increases in taxation and in railway and postal rates, estimated to produce in all 29 crores, leaving an uncovered deficit of 2f crores. His taxation proposals included an increase of the general tariff on imported goods, including cotton goods, from 11 per cent, to 15 per cent., and a simultaneous increase in the cotton excise from 3i- per cent, to 71- per cent., whereby the discrimination in favour of Indian cotton manufactures would be maintained at its previous figure. The Government of India realised that they would find great difficulty in securing the assent of the Legislature to so great an increase of taxation following the heavy increase of the previous year, and they had particularly in mind the severe criticism to which their military expenditure had been subjected. They desired therefore to ease the passing of their Budget by the following announcements.   They wished (1) to state that certain reudctions in British imits were to be effected ;(2) to publish certain conclusions of  the Military Requirements   Committeewhich had reported in India ; (3) to announce a scheme of Indianisation for the Indian Army.His Majesty&apos;s Government rejected proposals (2) and (3) and required some modification in (1). They have also been unable so far to accept proposals made by the Government of India for a partial withdrawal from Waziristan, in default of which the estimated deficit of 2f- crores was likely to be increased by 1  crores.3. Of a Budget of 142-^ crores on the expenditure side, only 3-1 crores were subject, to the vote of the Legislature; all the rest, including salaries and peusions t of the Imperial Services, interest on debt and the military estimates (67 crores gross), was non-votable.The Assembly had entertained the idea that the Viceroy was given discretion by the Statute to submit the military estimates not only to discussion but also to the vote of the Assembly ; and they hoped he would be prepared to exercise his discretion in favour of allowing a vote.The question was submitted through the Secretary of State to the Law Officers of the Crown, who held that the discretion did not extend to submitting the estimates to the vote. On the expenditure side, therefore, the Assembly could only exercise their vote on the demands for civil grants.   The votable estimates were* Annexure.t A croro - Us. 1,00,00,000 - (at Is. 4d.) 666,660?. 5286      100  4.22 A
considered in the week ending 18th March. As the estimates had been framed with rigid economy they offered the Assembly no opportunity of selecting items for reduction on their merits. The Assembly accordingly resorted to a system of arbitrary cuts, and reduced a number of the estimates by 5 per cent. These reductions were applied to the services for such revenue heads as Customs and Income Tax, producing a total reduction of 95 lakhs.*4. When, however, in the discussions on the Finance Bill from 20th-22nd March, the Assembly came to vote on the new taxation, they rejected proposals to an extent ten times greater than the reductions they had made on the expenditure side. They were presumably influenced not only by dislike of the taxation per sc, but by a desire to force a reduction of that part of the expenditure, mainly military, which they had been precluded from touching directly. In the result they threw out the increases in salt tax, in the duties on machinery imports and cotton imports, and in cotton excise, totalling 9 &quot;50 crores. They accepted increases totalling 19i- crores (including the increase in passenger fares, which is not part of the Bill, but is passed by Resolution).The net result of their proceedings has been to increase the original uncovered deficit of 2 &quot;71 crores to 12&apos;IS crores. The Government of India had already, however, with the consent of the Secretary of State in Council, agreed to suspend the statutory provisions for reducing the uncovered circulation of currency notes, thereby saving 3&apos;02 crores, and reducing the net deficit to 9 &quot;10 crores. If, however, no practical retrenchment can be effected to correspond to the arbitrary cuts on the expenditure side, and if there is no saving on Waziristan, the uncovered deficit will be swollen to between 11 and 12 crores.The Finance Bill was passed by the Assembly on the 22nd March, and by tho Council of State on the 24th March in the form in which it had left the Assembly.5. In telegrams of the 16th and 17th March, the Viceroy had informed the Secretary of State of the cuts -which had already been made on the expenditure side, and of his anticipation that some of the more important taxation proposals would be rejected. These telegrams were immediately considered and answered by the Secretary of State (Sir L. Worthington-Evans) in Council on the day on which they were received. In his telegram of 17th Marchf the Secretary of State informed the Viceroy that he would &quot; endorse a policy of conciliation by accepting any practicable &quot; alternative proposals for new taxation calculated to produce approximately the same &quot; revenue as the measures objected to, provided, of course, that the main scheme of &quot; your Budget is not undermined.&quot; The Secretary of State in Council developed his attitude by stating that in his opinion &quot;a true deficit of some 4 or 5 crores might in &quot; all the circumstances be admissible,but that one of, say, 10 or 12 would be &quot; dangerously excessive.&quot; He made it clear also that ho counted on the Viceroy making use of his reserved powers for restoring taxation negatived by the Assembly, and also for the restoration of the arbitrary cuts in the estimates.(&apos;). The reserved powers referred to are briefly as follows. The position created by the new constitution, under which the Government has no guarantee of a majority in either chamber of the Legislature, has been compensated by the Act in two ways. In the first place certain classes of expenditure, as has been shown above, are not notable by the Legislative Assembly. In the second place the Governor-General is empowered by section 67b in certain circumstances to pass a Bill over the head of the Legislature by certifying &quot; that the passage of the Bill is essential for the safety, tranquillity or interests of British India or of any part thereof.&quot;It was assumed that the Governor-General would on the present occasion have recourse to these powers. Further, although these powers are vested in the Governor-General personally, the Secretary of State for India has under clause 2 (2) of the Act general powers of superintendence, direction and control over all acts relating to the government or revenues of India, and if he is to discharge the responsibilities vested&apos;in him by Parliament he must beheld to have authority, under this section, to exercise control over such an issue as the certification of budget legislation. Somewhat similarly, under section 67a (7) of the Act, the Governor-General in Council has power to restore any reductions in demands for grants by the Legislative Assembly. In this case there can be no possible doubt of the subordination of the Governor-Geaieral in Coxmcil to the Secretary of State.* 95 lakhs ^ 95 pei&apos; cent, of one crore = 633,3331. f No. 1 in collection of telegrams below.
7. Two brief telegrams were received on 21st and 23rd March indicating that the taxes mentioned above had beou thrown out and that the Bill had been unanimously passed by the Assembly, but it was not until the receipt of the official and private telegrams of 25th March (Nos. 2 and 3 of telegrams attached;, when the Bill had already passed the Council of State, that the Secretary of State learned that the Viceroy and the Government of India had not accepted his telegram of 17th March as conveying instructions, and had acquiesced in the action of the Assembly.S. In the official telegram the Government of India state that if the Secretary of State&apos;s telegram of J7th March was intended to convey instructions as to the use of the personal powers of the Governor-General, they would have expected it to be addressed to the Viceroy personally. As to this it is only necessary to say that although the telegram might, not perhaps be interpreted as a definite legal instruction, it was in tho form in which the views of die Secretary of State are usually communicated to the Viceroy and was addressed to the Viceroy as head of the Government ; further, that ample time was allowed for the Viceroy to make any representations which he desired in reply to the Secretary of State&apos;s views or to request formal and definite instructions. As it is, the Secretary of State has been presented with a fait accompli. In the telegram of 17th March from the Secretary of State to the Viceroy it had been said that while a true deficit of some 4 or 5 crores might be admissible in all the circumstances, one of 10 or 12 crores would be dangerously excessive; and this is practically the deficit with which we are confronted. So large an uncovered deficit must necessarily affect injuriously the financial position of India, by reacting adversely on the lerms on which borrowing can be effected, by causing further inflation, and by lowering exchange. The extensive borrowing which would in any case have been required will be greatly increased, with further adverse effects on credit, or alternatively such essential operations as the rehabilitation&quot;of the railways might have to be curtailed.9. Having considered the whole position in Council I have come to the conclusion that no immediate drastic remedy is possible. Any attempt to compel the Govern-ment of India to introduce fresh taxation at the present stage would produce political -commotion which could only have more serious effects upon the tranquillity and financial stability and credit of India than the evil which it would seek to remedy. 1 have accordingly sent to the Viceroy telegram No. 4 in the collection attached (page 7 below).1.0. It is necessary, however, that the position should be made clear as regards the use of the reserve powers by the Viceroy, and as regards his respective responsi-bilities to the Legislature of India and to the Secretary of State and Parliament for using them. In the present case the Government of India, faced with a very difficult financial position, had prepared a budget which still left an uncovered deficit of &apos;2f crores, which fact may be taken as a measure of the difficulties they had experienced and the care they had exercised in taking all possible means to arrive at a balance In view of the prospective difficulties of the Government of India the Secretary of State in Council bad agreed that the operation of the Paper Currency Act should be temporarily suspended, and at the same time that some of the new items of taxation might he dropped if it were found desirable to conciliate opposition. Ha was prepared to contemplate a deficit of 5 crores ; but he regarded this as the &quot;maximum figure that could safely be faced. The Viceroy has now acquiesced in a deficit twice as great, and has decided that the occasion was not one on which he should exercise his special powers. Obviously, by continuing the same course for two or three years, or by somewhat greater rejection of taxation in any one year, the Legislature could make it impossible to maintain the establishments, such as the Military Establishment, which are withdrawn from their vote.11. Two issues appear to emerge which call for consideration.(i) Can the Governor-General be held to possess full discretion, without reference to the Secretary of State or superior authority, to determine on every occasion whether he shall or shall not exercise his reserved powers ?It will be seen from the last part of the Viceroy&apos;s private telegram of the 25th March that he reserves this as an open question. It will, I think, be essential to arrive at a clear understanding on the point.
 (ii) But there is a wider issue relating to the constitutional position of the Indian Legislature.There are not wanting indications that recently the Government of India have-sought to compromise matters with the majority of the Legislature against their own better judgment and against strong advice tendered to them by the Secretary of State. Here, again, it becomes necessary to examine the position thoroughly in order to ensure that the tendency to defer to the Indian Legislature should not be allowed to harden into a principle which would conflict with the responsibility of the Secretary of State to Parliament for Indian administration.Peel.5th April 1922.No. 1 ; Telegram from Secretary of State to Viceroy, Finance Department,dated 17th March 1922.P. 1197. Budget. Your telegrams of 16th and 17th March. Your desire to avoid deadlock, if possible, I. entirely share, and it was with this object that I have-agreed to suspend compulsory use of profits of Paper Currency Reserve for deflation. I would similarly endorse a policy of conciliation by accepting any practicable alternative-proposals for new taxation calculated to produce approximately same revenue as measures objected to, provided, of course, that the main scheme of your budget is not undermined.2. As regards imposing 15 per cent, on yarn and dropping of increase in cotton excise and introducing a wide export tariff, I would observe that your original proposals maintained existing balance in general scheme of taxation, so far as revenue position allowed, while adoption of the above-mentioned suggestions would disturb that balance to an undesirable degree and incidentally would prejudice the findings of the Fiscal Commission now sitting. While the proposal to increase by half anna the super-tax on companies might per se be accepted, it does not afford suitable set-off to proposed increase in cotton excise, which you spontaneously, and I think properly, proposed, and which must be retained, 1 consider, as an integral feature of your budget.3. As regards duty on silver, you are aware of objections previously taken to this, including its very uncertain yield, a point in the coming year of particular importance, and 1 do not, understand what is meant by unconditional remission of duty on export. If the intention is that this would involve automatic drawback of duty irrespective of whether actual silver has or has not paid duty, the proposal would, with a view to avoidance of abuses, require careful consideration.4. The rate of additional salt duty I recognise may be a matter for negotiation ; the abandonment of the proposal altogether I should deprecate. This has always been recognised as a legitimate reserve and a greater fiscal emergency is not likely to occur.5. To make my attitude as clear as possible though not absolutely inelastic,. I would suggest to you that a true deficit of some 4 or 5 crores might be admissible in all the circumstances, but that one of, say, 10 or 12 crores would bo dangerously excessive. In each case I mean by true deficit the deficit which would be left after (a) removing the provision for applying to the cancellation of ad hoe securities the Currency Reserve profits, and (6) making additional provision for Waziristan.0. From the general tenour of your telegrams, I am bound to assume that the requirements of the financial situation cannot be met without the use of your powers under the Government of India Act, section 07b, and you may rely upon my support in any action which you may take in consequence. You have no doubt carefully considered the procedure required to operate section 67a. It involves, I under-stand, formal recommendation of Bill to Assembly in a particular form before motion is put to Assembly to pass the Bill.7. Regarding arbitrary cuts made in connection with demands for grants, your spokesmen have doubtless pointed out that you are desirous of effecting every possible economy and intend to bring into immediate operation such economies as may be found practicable, even though Assembly should have approved high scale of expenditure. It is not possible to undertake to give practical effect to wholly arbitrary curtailment of a vote, and therefore I assume that you are intending to restore reductions so made, particularly under revenue heads, where more than
1proportionate loss of revenue might be involved by starvation of administrative expenditure. Here, again, in the use of your special powers you will have my support.No. 2. Telegram from Viceroy, Finance Department, dated 25th March 1922.Your telegram of the 23rd March, 1274. Budget. You will have now received our telegram of the 23rd March, No. 1905, giving the final result of the debates in the Assembly, which were, contrary to our expectations, continued till 22nd and terminated late that clay. As result of voting in Assembly position stood as follows (figures are in lakhs): (1) Taxation proposed by us reduced by 200 cotton excise, 430 salt, 1S5 machinery, 141 import duty piece-goods, total 956.(2) On the other hand suspension of paper currency provision improves revenue position coming year by 302.(3) Refund of taxation collected from 1st March will probably have to be paid next month amounting to 80.(4) Reductions made in vote for supplies amount to 95. We have not yet decided how far we shall be able to accept these. We anticipate that, under certain of the individual demands affected, it will be difficult, if. not impossible, to carry on with the reduced grant(s). On the other hand, it is possible that we can manage with the reduced amount under other head and may even be able to make further reduction(s). On the whole, we have decided not to make any definite restoration under any head at present stage, but shall consider whole matter at earliest opportunity.(5) Net result is to leave uncovered deficit of 910.2. When we received your telegram of the 17th March, 1107, budget, we regarded it as indication of your desiie that we should, if possible, attempt to work to deficit of not more than four or five crores, and failed to read in the concluding sentence(s) of your para. No. 2 and opening sentence(s) of your para. No. 6 a desire to convey, through us to Governor-General, an instruction that he should, in certain contingency, use the powers reserved to him by section 67 (6) of Act. We do not consider this a suitable occasion to discuss constitutional questions whether such instructions are within tenonr of the Government of India Act, but you will allow us to say we should have expected that, if it were intention to convey such instructions they would have, been couched in precise form, and directed to Governor-General personally, rather than in course of telegram addressed to Government of India.3. Tins will explain why we have not previously dealt with two passages of your telegram to which we have referred. Had we read them in the sense which your telegram dated 23rd instant seems to indicate, we should not, of course, have failed to take up the matter at once with you. We have now received your telegram No. 1295 of 24th instant, and regret that you should have felt hampered owing to any lack of fulness in the information supplied by us, or to any delay in its reaching you. We must point out, however, that pressure of public business has been so great that it was quite impossible for us to guarantee that information would not reach you earlier through newspaper channels. The sittings of Legislature have continuously occupied time of our officers day by day, and frequently till very late in the evening. We ourselves have endeavoured to keep you very fully informed of progress of discussion, and in our telegrams of 16th and 17th instant made a special point of sending you beforehand an appreciation, so far as we could then form one, of probable attitude which the Assembly would take. From the general tone of your telegrams we doubt if it is fully realised by.you how vast is the difference of the present conditions in Legislature from those which existed before Reforms. Existence of large non-official majority, together with constantly changing current of opinion amongst members, make it impossible for us to keep you in complete touch with developments which may arise at short notice and render it imperative for us to arrive at immediate decision without previous consultation with you.4. We understand that the Governor-General has already addressed you, and is again addressing you regarding the reasons which decided him not to make formal recommendations to Council of State to pass Bill in a form restoring some, or &quot;all, of the items of taxation refused by Assembly. We desire, however, to take this opportunity of informing you that before finally arriving at this decision, Governor--General consulted us on the matter. We unanimously advised him that the course be 5286 B
proposed to take was the proper one. The use by Governor-General of extra-ordinary powers conferred on him, personally, by the Act, should, in any case, be only resorted to on the occasion of such grave emergency as to override very serious results which must follow from such action. In the present case there would be no question of certifying the increase in tax on machinery or cotton duties having regard to the decrease made in the proposed cotton excise. There remained therefore only the proposed doubling of salt duty. To restore that piece of taxation by action which, although provided for by law, would be widely regarded throughout India as an arbitrary executive act taken with reference to a tax which is, rightly or wrongly, regarded with great sentimental dislike, would, we must frankly say, have been in our opinion most unwise aud would have increased substantially the task of governing-India. There might have been a stronger case for certification of the doubled salt duty if, against the political agitation which would have been aroused, there could have been set oil the great advantage which would have followed from our being able to publish the report of Military Requirements Committee, or to indicate that we were taking in hand some real and not illusory scheme of Indiauising the army. Our inability to making such announcement rendered it, we consider, inadvisable for the Governor-General to impose, by his own personal act, the extra salt duty.5. Failing such action by Governor-General, we presented Bill as passed by Assembly to Council of State and did not seek to insert amendments in that Council restoring those items. It is certain that amendments, even if carried in Council of State, would have been rejected again by Assembly.-We may add that your telegram of the 23rd March reached us too late to affect our action in this respect, as Bill was already being considered in Council of State when telegram was received. Bill was considered and passed by Council of State in yesterday&apos;s meeting. You will see from report of debate that Government speaker did not minimise serious difficulties created by existence of an uncovered deficit over nine crores.No. 3. Telegram from Viceroy, dated 25th March 1922.Private and personal. Your official telegram of (? 23rd) on Budget reached me this afternoon. The Council of State Avas actually passing the Finance Bill as it had emerged from Legislative Assembly. Official telegram in answer follows. I am personally very concerned about your statement that your telegram of 17th March contained instructions to me. Had I so regarded it I should immediately have communicated with you. I did regard it as expression of strong opinion, but I thought you realised the difficulties we were in respecting the whole Budget and that we were bound to come to decisions, during course of debate in the Assembly, which would give no time for consultation with you. I am not sure that situation has been quite appreciated by you. We have laboured to get Budget passed notwithstanding the objections and criticisms, and without having recourse to the Governor-GeneraUs powers of restoration upon his certificate that the safety, tranquillity or interests of India made it essential to pass the Bill as recommended by the Governor-General. There are serious technical difficulties regarding the procedure, and particularly having relation to procedure in both Houses, which I shall elaborate at a future date. It is obvious I could not recommend Bill in the Legislative Assembly unless we had at the outset adopted the decision to insist on all proposals of taxation, and without alternatively (corrupt group) Bill.Result of our deliberation on legal position was that I could not recommend that the Bill be passed in a particular form until it got to the Council of State, and if I had so recommended to the Assembly it would, in the opinion of those conversant with the views of the Assembly, have resulted in a complete block of Budget proposals. Having regard to the difficulties of the situation I thought we were doing on the whole not so badly to get Bill through leaving deficit of 9 crores. Although -we strongly (corrupt group) dislike this amount of deficit it was better to get Bill imposing the rest of the new taxation. The Council of State passed it without alteration in one day. Thus, although we have not got our full proposals, we have avoided constitutional crisis. The current of opinion in the Legislature has been constantly changing, and we could not feel sure of the action that would be taken. I sent you private and personal telegrams informing you as soon as I knew what was happening. The official telegrams are sent by my Financial Department, who have the precise information. Both Hailey, the Finance Member, and Cook, the Secretary of the Financial Department, have had a most trying time, and I cannot.but think have conducted the debates with great ability.   Neither of them regarded your
No. -1. Telegram from Secretamj of Stale to Vleeroy, Finance Department,dated 29th March 1922.Your telegram of the 25th March. Budget. Your decisions present me with a fait accompli. The situation resulting from the dangerously large deficit cannot in any real sense be remedied. But I trust you will appreciate, as a practical eonse-quence, that it wdll now be essential for both our rupee and sterling loans to offer such terms as will put their success beyond question.2. No doubt you will carefully watch both the revenue and the Ways and Means positions during the next few months and will be prepared to review them as soon as the necessary data are available, for instance, in October.3. I reserve for &quot;mature consideration all constitutional questions which arise from these occurrences.A N N E XII 11E.NOTE ON GOVERNMENT OF INDIA BUDGET, 1922-23.1. Though, in the first two budgets of the war the Government of India, as a Recent deliberate policy, refrained from imposing new taxation, in the latter years of the war, increases in. -and in the years immediately following the armistice, large increases have been taxatl0)1-made.   In 1916-17, in connection with the voluntary contribution of 1UU,000,0001. to His Majesty&apos;s Government for the purposes of the war, new taxation estimated to produce about 3fi. millions was imposed, this including an enhancement of the import duties the general tariff being raised from 5 to 7i- per cent, (cotton goods -excepted) of the salt tax from Rs. 1 to Rs. TJ per maund (82 lbs.), where it still stands^ and of the taxes on income.Tn 1917-18 further taxation was imposed estimated to produce 3-J-L millions ; the changes made in that year included the raising of the cotton import duties from 31 to 1\ per cent, without any corresponding increase in the excise, which was left at the level of ?rk per cent. . -telegram of the 17th instant as containing instructions. It was addressed to Viceroy, Financial Department. The certifying must be done by the Governor-General, not by the Governor-General in Council. I consulted all the members of my Executive Council, who were and are of opinion that it was most undesirable for me to certify.Your reference to observation in the Times that it was improbable that Govern-inent will use its powers to restore rejected proposals must be the opinion of correspondent. I have enquired, and find that no correspondent of the Times was at Delhi during the whole discussion, and there has been no communication with Times by any member of the Government. Presumably, this is the expressed view of some member of the Assembly.Telegrams both from me and my Financial Department will have crossed your telegram of 23rd, and all information is now before you.My private and personal telegram of the 23rd was sent under impression that debate in Council of State would continue, and the Bill would not be passed in one -day.There is little use, at the moment, in discussing the position of the Secretary of State, in relation to the Governor-General&apos;s obligation in certain eventualities to certify under 67b, Government of India Act. This is a point which must be elucidated, namely, whether under the Statute the Governor-General can be ordered by the Secretary of State to use a discretion vested in the Governor-General in a particular way. I have learnt to-day that there is a Despatch just received which has a bearing on this matter.   I shall study it, and communicate with you upon it later.As I have already told, you, question of certifying could only affect salt tax, as I had received your view that we could give way on machinery. I have sent you this full telegram as I am much disturbed that there should have been any misunderstanding -at the outset between you and me.You will have gathered that my private and personal of 23rd instant was sent to you in ignorance of the fact that you intended yours of 17th March to be regarded ;as instructions to me.
Indian finance since the armistice.In 1919-20 an Excess Profits Duly was imposed for one year calculated to produce about 7,500,000?.Iu 1920-21 a super-tax on companies at the rate of 1 anna in the rupee on profits exceeding Rs. 50,000 was imposed in lieu of a previous tax on their undivided profits. The additional revenue anticipated was only 44 lakhs. In this year, in accordance with the recommendation of the Currency and Exchange Committee of 1919, the import duty of 4 annas per ounce on &quot; silver was abolished. This change was made on account of currency and not fiscal considerations.2. In spite of these heavy increases of taxation the increase in military charges (including the cost of frontier operations), and the enhanced cost of administration generally, due mainly to the rise in prices which has occurred, have led in the last four years to a series of revenue deficits, namelv, in 1918-19 of G crores,* in 1919-20 of 24 crores, in 1920-21 of 26 crores, in 1921-22 of 33 crores. These deficits have, in effect, been financed either by borrowing or by inflation, that is,, the issue of what may for practical purposes be regarded as uncovered notes.In 1921-22, which was the first year of the reformed Councils, the Government of India succeeded with difficulty in carrying new taxation of 17-1- crores which was devised to enable them to cover the estimated expenditure of 1274- crores and to-work to a small surplus of 71 lakhs. The taxation passed in March 1921 took the following form : Additional Yield.Increase of postal charges Railway surcharge Enhancement of import duties Taxes on incomeTotalLakhs.715,35 8.17 3,2517,48This amounts, taking exchange at Is. id., to approximately 111?, millions.3. The estimated surplus for 1921-22 was unfortunately not realised. The principal causes of the deterioration were the falling off of revenue owing to the trade slump and increased military expenditure. A heavy additional charge was also incurred owing to the fact, that the level of exchange was much below the average of Is. Sd. assumed in the Budget. Under Customs there was a decline from the estimates of 4j crores, and under Railways, net receipts, of 13 crores ; under Military there was an increased expenditure of 2 &quot;75 crores, and a loss on exchange in the non-commercial departments of 5f crores.The upshot has been that a small budgetted surplus of 71 lakhs has been turned into a large deficit of 33 crores, the realised revenue for the year amounting to only 109 crores, while the revised estimate of the expenditure, in the year is now put at 142 crores.4. 1922-23.-The estimates foreshadowed a deficit of 31 f- crores on the existing basis of taxation. Having regard to the known difficulty that the passage of heavy additional taxation would present, and the hope that a material improvement would follow any trade revival, it was decided not to attempt to cover the whole deficit. The actual additional taxation proposed to the Legislative Assembly was as follows:  .Customs. Increase in general -ad valorem duty from 11 per cent, (the percentage fixed under the 1921 Budget) to 15 per cent., the Cotton Excise being at the same time correspondingly increased by 4 per cent., i.e., from ?.  to 7$ per cent. It was proposed to increase the duty on imported machinery from 2-g- to 10 per cent., while the duties on sugar, alcoholic liquors, matches, petroleum and luxury articles was also to be raised.   The yield was estimated at 14,90 lakhs.Salt. It was proposed to double the duty, raising it from Rs. 1-1- per rnaund (82 lbs.) to Rs. 2\ per maund, the figure at which it had stood up to 1903. This was expected to produce an additional 4,30 lakhs.Taxes on Income. The rates on higher incomes were to be raised, and the estimated additional yield was 2 - crores.* A crore = Rs. 1,00,00,000 as (at Is. M, exchange) 666,666/.; a lakh s Rs. 1,00,000 - (at Is. U. exchange) 6,666/. ; 100 lakhs - 1 crore.
Hallway Rales. It was proposed to enhance passenger fares with a view to obtaining G crores of new revenue. These increased, charges must be regarded as being not in the main extra taxation, but as a means of securing that the railways&apos;on which the loss arose should pay their way.Postal Rates. It was proposed to raise the i- anna inland postage rate on letters to 1 anna and the \ anna postcard rate to -J- anna. Proposals on these lines were introduced last year and were vigorously criticised in the Assembly. The proposal to increase the postcard rate was not carried, and, as regards the inland letter postage, the -J- anna rate was retained, in deference to popular feeling, for letters up to I- tola in weight. The additional revenue from this source was estimated to be about 1 * 6 crores.Summary of New Taxation Proposed.Crores.Customs - - - - - -14*9Salt     &apos; - - - - - -    4-3Taxes on Income   - - - - -    2&apos;2Railways - - - - -6&apos;0Postal Telegraph   - - - - 1&apos; GTotal - - -   29-029 crores at Is. 4c/. per rupee = 191Z. millions.It was estimated that, if taxation to this large extent was imposed, the Budget for 1922-23 would exhibit the relatively small deficit of 2f- crores.5. The programme in the Legislature was as follows :  Action on1st March.-Budget introduced and Finance. Bill formally laid. ShK ^Week ending 1.8th March. Votable estimates considered.

Of a total expenditure Budget of 142-J- crores, only 34 crores are subject to Demands vote, while JOS are immune from intervention of the Legislative Assembly. The for grants, latter figure includes the military estimates, amounting to G7 crores (gross), interest on debt 33 crores, and the salaries and pensions of the Imperial services. The Legislative Assembly, not being able to enforce a reduction in military expenditure by a direct vote on the Military Estimates, which they had also criticised, severely in the preceding year, adopted the course of imposing arbitrary cuts, generally, so far as known, of 5 per cent, of the amounts demanded under the majority of the votable civil heads, including the important revenue heads such as Customs and Income Tax. The total reductions effected amount to 95 lakhs.7. Of the proposals for new taxation referred to in para. 4 above, the Assembly Finance Bill rejected the following :  in Assembly.Additional Yield.Lakhs.(1) Increase of Rs. 1. 4 en salt ----- 430 (2) from 11 to 15 per cent, on cotton imports     - -   141(3)      ,,      from 3-f to 7f per cent. on. cotton excise       - -   200(4) on imported machinery from 2-i- to 10 per cent. -   185Total      - -        - -   95GAllowing for the increase in passenger fares which was not actually included in the Finance Bill, the amount of additional taxation accepted by the Assembly was about 19-1 crores.8.

As regards the grave drawbacks attached to budgetting for a delicit of the magnitude of 11 crores, representing, as this does, a percentage of about S-per cent, of the Government of India&apos;s total expenditure, there is indeed no difference of opinion between the views of the Government of India and the Secretary of State. This deficit is merely one of a succession of deficits amounting in all. to 90 crores in the last four years. These deficits, which have been financed largely by inflation of currency and credit, have been accompanied by a sharp rise in Indian retail prices. The increase of these, as compared with the 1914 level, is approximately the same as in this country. In India, however, where the margin of subsistence is small, such a rise is a far mere serious matter than in Western countries, and there can be little doubt that it has been a factor&apos; which has been largely exploited by the extremists in promoting discontent. Any further inflation of currency or credit can therefore only have the most undesirable results.The continuance of deficit budgets must also react directly on the stability of the rupee exchange and ou trade, and while it continues it is idle to consider the question, to which British and Indian, trade rightly attach the highest importance, of stabilising the rupee.There is also a serious danger that so large a deficit as 11 erores will seriously affect railway development; (a) because funds which might otherwise have been available for productive capital expenditure will have to be appropriated towards meeting the revenue deficit ; and (b) because so large a deficit will tend, directly to prejudice Indian credit, and so diminish the amount which it is possible to raise by Joan and increase the expense of any borrowing operations.A deficit budget of the present magnitude is also most unfortunate in view of the obligation resting on the Government of India in the near future to effect progressive reduction in the amount of the annual contributions of about 10 crores a year which they are due to receive from the Provinces.FlNANCI A I., D EI&apos; A RTM ENT,March 1922.* The expression &quot; deflation ,postponed&quot; refers to a sttUutory liability on tlie part of file Govern-ment of India to devote the profits on their note issue towards the reduction of their note -circulation&apos;.; A proposal to suspend, tlie operation of this provision of their cuiToncy legislation daring 1921-22 and. 1922-23 has been adopted, with the Government of India&apos;s approval, by the Legislative Assembly.
