British Delegation,B1PARATI0F COi&apos;j,If&apos;SION, Hotel Astoria, PARIS. 22nd liarch, 1922.i y dear Blackett,I hope to send to you tomorrow a full official report on the Reparation Commission decision of yesterday. You will he pleased to see that I managed after all to get the December payments counted towards the 720 millions. The Belgians wore mortally afraid of being forced into the position of having to take part in a majority decision, and finally gave me the point in return for my accepting a Delacroix draft in regard to some of the guarantee points whiah (though I did not altogether like the form of it) was substantially harmless.As regards guarantees, you will see that I have been able to avoid almost entirely both Reparation Commission responsibility for detailed measures and direct interference in German administration.      In form, however, I have had to melee some concessions to Prench sentiment, which I am afraid may raise a storm in Germany against what are in substance quite moderate proposals not extending beyond the right of examination, criticism and censure - the only sanction being u  to the 31a t May the non-confirmation and after t&amp;at date the cancellation of the moratorium.The most serious new element is the peremptory de-mand for an increase of German taxationi   This, however, is a necessary consequence of the Cannes figures.   To attempt to exact the Cannes programme without Buch an increase would, in my opinion, be ridiculous.   The political effect in Germany
of the demend my, however, he serious,ky most serious defeat is the &quot;penalty&quot; clause for wilful German failure to make deliveries in kind.   The French fought bard for a definite cash liability at the end of the year to the amount of the difference between the/prescribed figures and actual performance.   This I succeeded in resisting, but had finally to take the present text, which is a Belgian draft.      The intention, of course, is merely to bring -pressure to bear on Germany to make a serious effort to deliver as muoh as possible.   The penalty is not exigible until the end of the year and then only if the Reparation Commission is satis-fied that the shortage is due to German obstruction.   In prac-tlce if an attempt were made to apply it the effeot would be merely to increo.se the 19S3 liability and make a larger cut necessary in that liability when we oame to consider it than that which will have to be made in any case.The real objection, of course, is the effect on German credit.   I told the French that the result of insisting on it would be that they could say goodfcye to any hope cf arranging a German foreign lorn in 1922.   But even that failed to move thenwThe most tiresome loose end is the &quot;Sxport of oapitalM point.     The Frenoh fought obstinately for incorporating a lot of fantastic machinery which would probably have come very near to bringing German foreign trade to a standstill without effecting their purpose,     I finally had to agree to reserve power to impose additional conditions and postpone the battle.Yours Bincerely,(Sd.) JOHF BRADBURY.
