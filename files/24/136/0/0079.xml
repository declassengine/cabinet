May 1922.SECRET.CP. 3978.CABINET.SPECIAL REPORT ON UNEMPLOYMENT.No. 66.WEEK ENDED MAY 12, 1922.THE  SITUATION.The lock-out in the shipbuilding industry has terminated, and the workers suspended are gradually being re-engaged, but the return to work is affected by the continuance of the engineering dispute.Coal-mining in Lancashire has received a further set-back, but the improvement previously recorded in the pits in Yorkshire and Durham continues.The iron and steel industries are very quiet, but there is evidence of an increase in the export trade. The depression in the Midlands continues, although at one centre a slight improvement in iron-founding has been reported.Although the dispute in the engineering trade generally continues, isolated agreements have been reached in certain towns, but in the South-Eastern, South-Western, North-Western and Scottish Divisions this trade is practically at a standstill.There is evidence of an increased activity in the cotton trade. Short-time working is still widely in operation, but hopes are entertained that a longer working week will shortly be adopted.Constant and regular employment is reported from Scotland in the hosiery, woollen and textile industries, but the improvement recorded in the North-Eastern Division has not been maintained.The clothing trade is reported to be fairly brisk, but is still subject to seasonal fluctuation. In the South-East of England there is a demand for cutters and machinists.The building trade generally is quiet, but seasonal decorative and repair work is proceeding.In the boot and shoe industry the improvement in trade at Northampton has been maintained; but, while the position at Stafford is favourable, depression still exists at Kettering and Leicester. In Scotland there is considerable unemployment in the fishing industry on account of the heavy costs of running vessels.T. J. MACNAMARA,Ministry of Labour

Workpeople who are unable so to comply are excluded.I. SUMMARY OF ACTION TAKEN BY THE GOVERNMENT.[From Autumn 1920 onwards.] Cabinet Unemployment Committee.The prospect of a severe trade depression first became evident in the early autumn of 1920. On the 13tb August, 1920, there was a special discussion at a meeting of the Cabinet, when the Cabinet Unemployment Committee was appointed to consider the whole question and devise means for relieving unemployment.(A.) Unemployment Insurance.An Unemployment Insurance Act of general scope came into operation on the 8th November, 1920. The Act applied compulsory insurance against unemployment to 12,000,000 persons as compared with 4,000,000 previously. Subsequent amending Acts modified the conditions as regards rates of benefit, extended the periods of benefit and increased the contributions. As from November 1921 the Unemployed Workers&apos; Dependants&apos; (Temporary Provision) Act, 1921, made temporary provision for grants in respect of wives, dependent husbands and children, and imposed a special levy to provide for these grants. The Unemployment Insurance Act, 1922, which operates as from the 6th April, 1922, amalgamates the dependants&apos; grants with Unemployment Benefit, and the special levy with the Unemployment Insurance contributions, and extends until June 1923 the special periods during which &quot; uncovenanted &quot; benefit may be drawn. The authority ^to borrow money from the Treasury is increased to  30,000,000 for Great Britain.Table showing amount paid out in Unemployment Benefit (including Benefit in respect of Dependants) and the Contributions during the period November 8, 1920, to May 6, 1922.

(B.) Emergency Works and other Measures.A full statement of the measures taken in the autumn of 1920 and of the later measures from autumn 1921 onwards has been set out in previous issues of this Report. At least 250,000 men have had employment on these schemes at various times, and at the present time over 133,000 men are employed, exclusive of the work provided for men in ancillary occupations and the effect of the Export Credits and Trade Facilities Act schemes (see table below). &apos;SUMMARY SHOWING THE LABOUR EMPLOYED AT MAY 5, 1922, ON CERTAIN OF THE SCHEMES REFERRED TO ABOVE.Scheme.
