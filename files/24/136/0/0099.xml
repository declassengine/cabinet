MANDATE FOR PALESTINE.The Earl of Balfour to the Secretary to the Cabinet. (Received May 20.)Sir, ^ Geneva, May 17, 1922.YOU will be aware, from the telegrams I have despatched to London during the last week and from my despatch dated the 12th May, of the situation which has arisen at the Council during its present session over the request which I put forward at the first meeting, on the 11th May, that the terms of the mandate for Palestine should now be formally approved by the Council with an announcement of their intention to issue it in that form as soon as the Treaty of Peace between the Allied and Associated Powers and Turkey has been concluded.2. Two elements have militated against success attending my efforts to induce the Council to take on this occasion the action desired; the first being the fact that the question of the Palestine mandate was not formally on the agenda of the Council asvcirculated to its members beforehand.3. This was due, of course, to the desire of His Majesty&apos;s Government to await the assent of the United States Government to the communication to the Council of the notes which had been exchanged between the two Governments on the subject. That assent was not forthcoming on the day the Council met and has now, in fact, been withheld, although the United States Government have, on their own account, published a statement of their attitude on this question and have said that they see no objection to the result of the negotiations with His Majesty&apos;s Government being explained to the Council.4. The non-appearance of the question on the agenda undoubtedly gave the impression (unwarranted, I admit, but nevertheless inevitable) that the question was being rushed through the Council without proper consideration, and it is now clear that it would have&apos; been wiser to have placed the question formally on the agenda some weeks ago and then to have withdrawn it at the last moment if the negotiations with the United States Government had not happily concluded in time,5. The second obstacle which has been encountered unexpectedly so far as I was concerned has been the intervention of the Vatican, 1he result of which has become more and more evident as the deliberations of the Council proceed.6. It was only after the first meeting of the Council that I received a copy of the despatch from His Majesty&apos;s Minister at the Vatican to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, No. 58 of the 13th April, but since that despatch was written the Vatican would seem to have redoubled its efforts to stir up opposition to the draft mandate for Palestine as it stands at present. At all events the extent of the campaign undertaken by the Vatican can scarcely have been realised in London. It is no exaggeration to say that the reluctance of the French, Polish, Spanish, Italian and Brazilian representatives on the Council to discuss now the Palestine mandate or the question of the chairmanship of the Holy Places Commission has been due to the representations which have been made to their Governments by the Papal representatives.7. A certain reluctance on the part of Italy to discuss these two questions, except as part of a bargain over the general settlement in the Near East, was not, of course, unexpected after the action taken by the Italian representative at the sixteenth session of the Council last January, which was reported in detail to the Cabinet at the time by Mr. Cecil Harmsworth, M.P., who represented His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment on the Council at that session.8. The arguments of the French Government (contained in M. Poincare&apos;s note to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Paris dated the 10th May) as to the ill-effects of a premature approval of the Palestine mandate on the mandate for Syria and the position of France in that country, also possess some force and appear to me difficult either to answer or to ignore.9. Such was. briefly, the situation as disclosed after I had invited the Council to place the Palestine mandate on the agenda for discussion at the present session, and in the circumstances I decided to. ask for a public meeting of the Council in184121 . b
order that I might make clear to the world at large the position of His Ma;jesty&apos;s Government, and counteract if possible the statements which have been circulated broadcast that His Majesty&apos;s Government, in carrying out the terms of the mandate, would permit themselves to be unduly influenced by one or other of the powerful religious organisations which are interested in that country.10. At the public sitting held to-day I accordingly made a statement as follows : &quot; M. le President: I had hoped that in the course of the discussions that take place at this meeting of the Council it would have proved possible to make one step forward in the direction of a final settlement of all these mandates connected with the Middle East. I have been disappointed; but do not let anybody suppose that the disappointment is due either to the fact that the absence of discussion at this meeting delays the final settlement of the problem, or because I am afraid that the general policy which the Allied and Associated Powers and the League of Nations have endorsed is in the smallest danger. Neither of these preoccupations have animated me on this occasion. As regards the final juridical date at which the mandates for the Middle East will become part of a fixed and authoritative law of nations, that can only be when the Treaty of Sevres is finally ratified. But please remember that that is a purely technical point. The Treaty of Sevres and the remodelling of the Treaty of Sevres have nothing whatever to do with the policy of mandates either in $he Near East or anywhere else. Grave questions undoubtedly are going to be discussed, and have been already discussed among the interested Powers with regard to certain provisions in the Treaty of Sevres; but those parts of the Treaty of Sevres which refer either to the general policy of mandates or to the particular mandates required in the Middle East, tho;se parts of the Treaty of Sevres have never been, and are not going to be, subject to discussion among the Allied and Associated Powers. Therefore, when I say that nothing that this Council at this meeting will do; no number of resolutions that we pass, will make the juridical date earlier than it would otherwise have been, you will observe that I am dealing with a purely technical point which has no relation to the substantial policy with which we are concerned.&quot; Let me repeat that the general policy has already been decided, and is outside any discussion which could take place round this table. There is not the slightest doubt that the views which the Allied and Associated Powers have explicitly declared are not going to be reversed. Nobody need be under the least fear, and nobody, let me add, need entertain the least hope, that those broad lines of policy are going to suffer any alteration. My regret, therefore, that the discussion has had to be postponed has no relation to the fundamental considerations on which I have just dwelt. It is based purely upon administrative expediency. I ask you to remember not merely that the task thrown upon the mandatory in Palestine is one of great delicacy and difficulty, but that it is also one which requires for its adequate development the obtaining of large pecuniary resources. Unless we are able, as I am confident that ultimately we -shall be able, so to develop the economic capacities of Palestine as to enable it to support a much larger population in much greater comfort than is at present possible, then our hopes as to the future of the country are, no doubt, doomed to disappointment. Money, therefore, is required; productive capital is absolutely necessary; and everybody who Knows the present condition of the world, and the difficulty of obtaining important sums for any purpose whatever, must be perfectly well aware that anything which postpones, or even appears to postpone, the final and definitive settlement of our problem, discourages the lenders, and makes it more difficult to obtain their much-needed assistance. I hope, therefore, that all my colleagues on the Council will remember that we the Government I represent feel ourselves in rather a special position as regards the duties thrown upon us by the mandate, and that in the interests of sound administration every step taken towards the technical regularisation of our position is of the utmost possible value.&quot;Now I believe the public have been puzzled, and perhaps not unnaturally puzzled, by the delay which has occurred in connection with this mandate; and, being puzzled, some of them say: &apos; Well, is this delay due to any indecision on the part of either of the Allied and Associated Powers, or of the Council of the League of Nations, or of the mandatory Powers V Are any of these authorities shrinking from the policy already declared?&apos; In other words, they are inclined to interpret delay as a sign of indecision. The error is a grave one; but I think I can dissipate it by explaining in a very few words how the difficulties have occurred. I have already referred to the fact that so far as the embodiment of our policy in a, final treaty is concerned, that has suffered delay not at all because of any question
connected with the mandates, but because other questions wholly alien to the mandate problem have preoccupied the Powers who are signatories of the Treaty of Sevres. On this point I need say no more. But there is another point which I do not think is fully understood by the public, and on which perhaps my colleagues will allow me, as this is a public session, to say a word in order to dissipate prevailing misconceptions.&apos;&apos; Under the Treaty of Versailles and the Treaty of Sevres it was always contem-plated that America, who had signed those treaties, would also share in the ratifica-tion of the Treaty bf Versailles, and would become in that sense a full party to all the responsibilities and all the labours of the Allied Powers. You all know that for various reasons, which I need not discuss, that consummation has not been reached; but America very naturally said : &apos; The fact that I have not ratified the Treaty of Versailles does not interfere with my rights, or even my duties, as one of the Allied and Associated Powers in connection with the territories which the victory of the Allied and Associated Powers placed in their hands at the conclusion of a successful war.&apos; And America has therefore claimed that she shall have a voice in the mandates; the sort of voice which she would have had, had she been a member of the League of Nations, and had she occupied the seat which still awaits her should she vWish to occupy it at this table.  The result of this action on the part of the AmericanGovernment is that a fresh series of discussions had necessarily to take place between them and the Allies upon these problems. Great Britain, for example, has been discussing with the American Government the terms of the mandate, and we are in entire agreement about it. They cordially accept the principle of the mandate in its entirety; and I believe, though I have had no official intimation of the facts, that in addition to this action of the American Government, the American Senate has unanimously expressed its approval of the policy embodied in the Palestinian mandate. But all this has to be put in treaty form. Diplomacy moves slowly. And it was not till the very eve of the meeting of this Council that we received the final statement from our American friends, the general tenor of which I have already explained to you. &quot;We received it so late that it was quite impossible for the British Government to give that notice to our colleagues, which of course we should other-wise have done had we intended to raise this question at the Council. The result was that when I came to Geneva this question was not on the agreed agenda, and I had to ask permission of my colleagues to allow me to raise it. They felt, or some of them felt (I dare say all of them felt), but at all events some of them felt, that while there was probably no objection at all to the substance of anything proposed, they had not had sufficient notice either to enable them to discuss the question with their own Governments or to enable those Governments themselves to consider whether this method of dealing with one mandate at a time in the Middle East was or was not a convenient method of procedure from a general point of view. They therefore felt, not unnaturally, that they ought not, in the English phrase, to be &apos; rushed&apos; in the matter. The last thing that the British Government desires, of course, is to rush anybody into any proposal which they have not had time to consider, and I make no complaint against the action taken. I only want my colleagues to remember that it is an action which has had some inconvenient repercussion in Palestine itself from the administrative point of view.&quot;You will see, therefore, that the delay, however serious may be its practical effects, in no sense touches any of the broad questions of principle in which the public are interested. Many of them, I think, are in error as to the powers of the League of Nations or of this Council, which for many purposes represents the League; they are in error, I say, as to the powers which these bodies possess in regard to mandates.&quot;The mandates are not our creation. The mandates are neither made by the League nor can they in substance be altered by the League. Our duties are of two kinds. - It is our business in the first place to see that the specific and detailed terms of the mandates are in accordance with the decisions come to by the Allied and Associated Powers in article 22 of the Treaty of Versailles, and, in the second place, to see that, in carrying out those mandates, the mandatory Power shall be under the supervision not the control, but the supervision of the League of Nations, which possesses an admirable organisation through which it can obtain the fullest informa-tion as to the method in which each mandatory Power fulfils the duties which are entrusted to it.&quot;Remember that a mandate is a self-imposed limitation by the conquerors on the sovereignty which they obtained over conquered territories. It is imposed by the Allied and Associated Powers on themselves in the interests of what they conceived[8412]n 2
to be the general welfare of mankind; and they have asked the League of Nations to assist them in seeing that this policy should be carried into effect. But the League of Nations is not the author of the policy, but its instrument. It is not they who have invented the system of mandates; it is not they who have laid down the general lines on which the three classes of mandates are framed; their duty, let me repeat, is to see in the first place that the terms of the mandates conform to the principles of the Covenant and, in the second place, that these terms shall in fact regulate the policy of the mandatory Powers in the mandated territories.&quot;Now it is clear from this statement that both those who hope and those who fear that what I believe has been called the &apos; Balfour Declaration &apos; is going to suffer substantial modifications, are in error. The fears are not justified, the hopes are not justified. The general lines of policy stand, and must stand. I am aware, of course, that a certain- wave of anxiety has affected some sections of opinion lest this mandatory system as applied to Palestine should have an injurious effect upon the religious interests of this or that great Christian body. I confess to feeling, I will not say indignation that would be too strong a word but surprise, that any human being should suppose that Christian interests should suffer by the transfer of power in Palestine from a Mahommedan to a Christian Power; and, frankly, my surprise is not diminished when I reflect that that Christian Power is Great Britain. I venture boldly to claim for my country and I do not believe that anybody who listens to me or who does me the honour to read what I say will contest the claim  that no Power has shown itself more equitable in its treatment of different religious creeds, more anxious to avoid offending religious susceptibilities. We have had immense experience in dealing with religions other than Christian. And, as regards the various forms of the Christian religion, everybody will admit who knows anything about the practice of my country, that we have shown the utmost fairness and the utmost generosity in dealing even with those denominations from which the majority of our population widely differ. We are a Protestant country, but I boldly say that I do not believe that in any country, Protestant or Catholic, has the Catholic religion received fairer or more generous treatment than it has within the British Isles. Now, is it credible, that when you have by the fortune of war taken away from a Mahommedan country and put under a Christian mandatory places which have sacred associations for large bodies of Christian believers, is it credible, I ask, that these should suffer by the transfer % And remember that whatever is done in Palestine now or in the future is done in the light of day. The machinery of the Mandates Commission, the machinery of the Council of the League of Nations, the machinery of the Assembly of the League are all contrived to make it quite impossible that any transaction of general interest should take place except in the full glare of the noonday sun of public opinion. And to suppose that in those circumstances there is the least chance of deliberate injustice or careless administration being either practised or permitted in Palestine seems to me one of the most extravagant and baseless fears by which any body of men were ever assailed.&quot; I have explained, I am afraid at great length, but I hope with adequate detail and lucidity, exactly the position in which, as I conceive it, the general mandate question for Palestine and the Near East stands. I have explained why all the regrettable delay has occurred; I have explained why the final juridical settlement of the whole question is still in the future; I have explained that this in no sense involves a modification of the lines of Palestinian policy laid down by the Allied Powers and emphatically endorsed by America. I have indicated also why it is that I am most anxious that a step forward should be taken as soon as possible in the interests of Palestinian administration. You will permit me, therefore, M. le President, to conclude by asking my colleagues to agree to a proposal under which this question shall come up again before a future meeting of the Council, and I would suggest that that meeting should be held within the next six weeks.&quot;11. My observations were well received by my colleagues on the Council. The Japanese representative immediately, without any suggestion on my part, gave my proposal for a special meeting of the Council in six weeks&apos; time to consider the Palestine and other mandates his entire support. The French and Italian representatives, whilst supporting my conclusions, pleaded for a little elasticity as regarded the date of the special meeting of the Council. They agreed that the policy which the Allied and Associated Powers had pursued since the Treaty of Peace as regards mandated territories had not changed and never would be modified. After some further discussion, which will be found in the minutes of the eleventh meeting,
it was agreed that a special session of the Council should be held not later than the 15th July next to deal specially with the &quot; A &quot; and &quot; B &quot; mandates.12. Before concluding this despatch I desire to urge upon the Government at home the necessity of entering at once into communication with the various Governments represented on the Council as well as with the Government of the United States, in order to secure a final settlement of the mandates in July next. It also seems to me desirable that action should be taken to explain fully and frankly to the Vatican the objects of the policy to be pursued by His Majesty&apos;s Government in Palestine. Further it is important that nothing should be left undone to expedite an agreement between the French and United States Governments as to the Syrian mandate, and an agreement between the French, ourselves and the United States over the &quot;B&quot; mandates. If this can be accomplished before the special meeting of the Council in July, I am confident that no further obstacle to the formal approval of the Palestine mandate will be encountered.I am, Sir,Your obedient Servant,(Signed)        BALFOUR.
