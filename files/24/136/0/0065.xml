XDENTIAL.tp964, C A B I N Ei T.IRAQ   AIR-  FORGE -Extract from a letter to the Chief of the Air Force from Air Vice Marshal Sir H.L. . Ellington,, K.0,3. date! 21st April, 1922,(Circulated by the Secretary.of State for theColonies)-I had an excellent time in Iraq and was exceedingly well looked after by Borton (Air Officer Commanding).      I visited Hillah and Mosul, besides Bagdad, and flew over Nejef and Kerb el a c      I v; as &quot;very much impressed with the whole of the&apos;&apos; Air Force in Iraq,- both in its organisation and the high moral of all. I came in contact withe     They have great opportunities as small shews are of almost daily occurrence and they make the most of their opportunitiesP      I was also impressed with the reliance the Civil Authorities place, on aircraft^     The Army also have considerable enthusiasm for the R.A*F.I saw Hinaidi, which is getting on well.     It will of course be a long time before it becomes a shady and comfortable cantonnait.,   .      Although the junior officers at Bagdad and no doubt at Shaxba too look forward to the end of the two years, I think the Squadron Leader and senior officers like the place.I went up to Mosul and stayed with the squadron there -. 55th, commanded by Blackburn.     Mosul is a delightful place at this time of the year, with a wonderful, view of the snows&apos;. Blackburn runs a very good show and everyone there seemed quite happy; ponies and their keep are cheap and most cf the squadron play poloc     They mounted me for two Chukkas,  and there were 10 in all that afternoon - we played on a grass ground. From Mosul T flew to Zakho, one of the outposts 75 miles from Mosul, manned by two companies of the Levies.     These men are Assyrians&apos;, Christians, belonging to the Tiari tribe which, before the Turks tried, to exterminate them,, could turn out 16,000 fighting men.     Now they can only produce 2,000, all of whom have en.Listed and live with their families at the outposts. It is like the Roman Military Colonies on the Wall in the North Of England,     They are the keenest soldiers I have ever seen, have already been used in a scrap where they did exceedingly well, and. I see no reason why in a year or so they should, not be as good as any Battalion in the Indian Army.,     These were the only Levies I saw; if the others are as good they should be a very fine force, but I expect the material of the rest is hardly up to the standard of the Tiaris.(The Central Camp of the Plying Corps, five or six miles from Baghdad). &apos;
