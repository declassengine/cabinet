REPLY OF THE FRBMCH QOV&amp;LWmtT.--,-5Faris vMarah - USuA^J.9Translation. Sir,In accordance with a decision of the Council dated January 13th, 19S2, you submitted for the consideration of the Government of the Republic the recommendation of the First Assembly that, subject to tha conditions sat out therein, Members of the League should undertake not to exceed for the next two financial years the sum total of their expenditure on military, naval and air forces provided for in the budget of that year.I have the honour -to Inform you that, for the reasons already set out in its letter Ho, 91 of April 80th, 1921. the Government of the Republic is of opinion   that it is not possible for it to assume the obligation provided for in this recommendation,, for which its representatives at Geneva did not vote.     In accordance however with the promise which it gave in 1921 it has endeavoured to raflnce its armaments as far   as 13 consistent with tha requirements of its international obligations and its national security.The whole of tha credits granted to the War department (for war and military aviation) under the budget estimates and under the laws for supplementary credits has been reduced by stages from 6 milliards - the figure at which it stood in 1920 - to 5,400,000,000 in 1921 and 4,500,000,000 in 1922, i.a. by a quarter.In the same way the Haval Sstimates have been reduced from 952 millions in 1921 to a sum of only 797 millions in 1922.The Government of the Republic is glad to bring these results to the knowledge of the League of Nations,I am, etc., iSgd).

-   4in.53PLY PHOM TH3 SWEDISH GOVaSBlEBi T.STOCKHOLM,ilaroh 20th, 1922.Sir,In a letter dated January 13th 1922 you were good enough to remind the Boyal Swedish Government that the Seoohd- Assemhly of the League of Nations&apos;, at its meeting held on October 1st, 1921, unanimously decided to submit again for consideration to all the &apos; Mam hers of the League the Recommendation adopted hy the First Assembly, -to the effect that Mem hers of the League should undertake not to exceed in the two following financial years the total of their military., .naval and air expenditure provided in the &quot;budget for the present year. &apos;. In conformity with a Decision taken by the Council on January 13th, last, you again drew the attention of the Swedish Government to this Ttecommoxidation.In reply, I have the honour to inform you that the enquiry concerning the future organisation of the national defence of Sweden, mentioned in a letter from my predecessor dated August 19th, 1921, has not yet been completed..     It is now certain, however, that the result of the enquiry will be a proposal to effect a considerable-reAuction in tho expenditure involved hy the present military organisation. The military burdens of Sweden however have been provisionally lightened to such an extent that a lar6e proportion of the possible reductions have already been carried into effect. It would clearly he very difficult to state, exactly the extent to which these/burdens can be reduced, but the tendency of the military budgets of Sweden in this respect
may be seen from tho Tact that the military expenditure for the financial year 1921 amounted to 829,738,000 Crowns ana has been estimated at 165,154,700 Crowns in the budget for 1932, whereas the military expenditure in the budget at present before the Riksdag - which, as a result of a ohange in tho date of the beginning of the budget year, only involves expenditure in respect of the first six months of 1923 - does not exceed 73,89b,000 Crowns.    In this latter budget, however as a result of the general diminution, considerable reductions have been carried out in every respect.As it is anticipated that the military expenditure for the whole year 1983 will- only amount to about twice this s-um, the Swedish Government is in a position to limit military expenditure in accordance with the spirit which animate*3 the Assembly in adopting the Recommendations referred to above.I have the honour to be, etc.fSgd).
