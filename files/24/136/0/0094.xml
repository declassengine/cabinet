OEPICER COMMANDING-IN-CHIEFOH THE SITUATION IN IRELAND -TOR THE WEEK ENDING  Oth MAY, 1922.(Circulated by the Secretary of State for War).GENERAL.irTspite of the failure of tho representatives of the provisional Government and the Republicans to oome to a satisfactory settlement, the terms of the &quot;truce&quot; appear to have been generally observed;    the &quot;Chief of Staff&quot; of the Provisional Government forces stated that only 60 breaches of the truce by the Republicans had been reported to him. These breaches include only those against the Provisional Government&apos; forces, the lives and property of private individuals not being safe-guarded by the Government, and raids, looting and arson continue.In the country districts in MUNSTER the communist party is becoming more active and the wo risers have taken over the management of all branches of Cleeves Creameries.On evening of 20th May an agreement between Mr,&apos; Collins and Mr. &apos; do Valera was arrived at, whereby a Coalition of the two parties should be formed.     The result, of this move is viewed with mixed feelings ae it appears to be another case of a Government in a com-paratively strong position giving way to  the unreasonable demands of an aggressive minority.   It is Impossible to forecast at present whether this agreement will lead to peace and a cessation.of outrage, either in the-South or the North.3.     No information has been received regarding the three officers and the private soldier kidnapped near MAC ROOM and it is feared they must have been murdered.3.     No action has been taken by the Provisional Government to bring to justice the men responsible for the murder of Gunner Rolfe,. who was shot in DUBLIN on-12/5/22.4.

If we cannot honourably work the constitution as the. quickest way to that ond^     the constitution must go.   Until it is published we cannot see out way clearly and till then we shall take our orders from G.H.;*i.-under tho Dail Ministry      ;v-;or of Defence ui\Less we are asked to do sane thing which would be dishonourable.   We do not antioipato the latter arising as the Minister of Defence has given his word that the army shall bo kept as the Irish Republican Army.The immediate Job which is up to us here in Ulster no matter what happens in the rest of the country is to got Ulster to recognise tho principle of a Unites Ireland.. We mast concentrate on our osm job, keeping our Units intact and training thern for the work that is before us and with the help of God we shall make Ulster   part of a FT/EE IRISH REPUBLIC.BEIR BUAIDH.CLEANS 3I0HNE,
