MEMORANDUM&apos; OK THE PALESTINE MANDATE.&apos;X,,At the January session of the Go uno il of the League of Nations His MajostyVs Government drew attention to the inconvenience caused by the delay in the definition of the terms of the Mandate for Palestine.     They had hoped that it might have been possible to request the Council to give formal approval, of the terms, while withholding the final issue of the Mandate until a treaty of peace with Turkey had been completely ratified.       This hope was based upon an assumption that the United States Government would regard as satisfactory assurances given by His Majesty&apos;s Government in a Note addressed to the United States Ambassador in London in December Of. last- year.      The pra-occupations of the Washington Conference- resulted in the State Department in Washington being unab3.e to reply to the Note of His Majesty1 s Coyernment sufficiently early for any announcement to he made to the Council of the League of Nations as to the attitude of the United States Government, and His Majesty&apos;s Government are reluctantly compelled to postpone their request for formal approval by the Council of the terms of the draft Mandate.Since the last session of the Council correspondence has been passing between His Majesty&apos;s Government and  the United States Government, as a. result of which complete agreement has been reached.       The United States Government have expressed satisfaction with the assurances given by His Majesty1s Government end now desire that these assurances should be incorporated in a treaty.    His Majesty&apos;s Government. have, signified their concurrence in this proposal,
and have suggested to the United States Government that negotiations shall be opened without delay.     It has been agreed that the Treaty shall contain a Recital of tho mandate in the form finally approved;.by the Council of the League; and if this suggestion&quot;ls accepted;, the definition of the terms of the&apos; mandate, will become an indispensable preliminary to further.action.being: takehwThe United States Government have &apos; expressed the desire that American capitulatory rights should not bo. abrogated in Palestine, but should be suspended during the continuance of the Mandate and should revive on its termina-tion unless the United States Government should then agree by treaty to their modification ox suspension, &apos;.   it had already Otccurred to His Majesty&quot; s&apos; Government that .it would be desirable to insert &quot;some provision, in&quot; the-Mandate under/which the special rights Of&apos; foreigners .in-judicial matters should be preserved&apos;after the termination&apos;of the Mandate- to such an extent as circumstances should then-appear, to necessitate. They therefore-propose that Article -8&apos;.of the&apos;.Mandate should read as follows:-    &quot; &quot;&quot;&apos;-.&quot;-.&quot;The immunities and privileges, of f oreignars, . . -including the benefits of consular juris-diction and protection as formerly enjoyed by capitulation or usage in the Ottoman - Empire are suspended in Palestine, but &quot;shallbe revived immediately and completely upon.the termination of the &quot;mandate regime unless -: .the powers whose-nationals were entitled-on . August 1st, 1914 to. such rights should agree
or havo, already, agreed by treaty to their s.supplies re s s, i o n or mod if i c at ion&quot;.. The Council.are aware, that tho..President in,his letter to the prime.

&quot;B&quot;Memo ran dum on Holy I lac e s 0 commision si on *The Council will recollect that at its January session the following Resolution was proposed and recorded:-&quot;The Council have taken note of the letter addressed to the Secretary-General on January 3rd, regarding the appointment of. the Chairman of the Commission in Palestine provided for in Article.14.of the: draft Mandate,&apos;and being desi.rous - of - f ac illtating- in- any- way. pcssi bio: the - task- of the Mandatory In Palestine, agrees to &apos;appoint the Chairman of the.- above-mentioned Commission:.and Invites the Members of the Council - to consider names and. qualifications of persons suitable with a view to making an appointment at its next session,   . . - &apos;. - - /, &apos;   ;-    --&apos;&quot;-&apos;&apos;      &apos;-&apos; - - -----&quot;The Council also invites the British&apos;: Government to communicate to it, confidentially if. heceS&amp;aryj&apos;-&apos;-the\ exact composition ef the Commission they havs in mind, together with the names of. individuals who will be- Vinyl ted -to sit upon It*&quot;     - -&apos;    &apos;. -&apos; v V..       .&quot;: -     &apos;     &apos; - &quot;&quot;      &apos; -In pursuance of the latter part of the-- ResolutionHis Majesty&apos;s Cover nnent submit&apos; the following frame of ttt-e.Commission::- -&apos; .&apos;.      -.&apos;        &apos;-: . &apos;--&apos;&apos;...:.(!:)   -A Chairman appointed--by- the Connoil; of the League : of nations.-----   His Majesty&apos;s Government consider that the Chairman should be a man of., wide experience, and of judicial temperament, commanding the confidence ef all parties interested in the Holy places, and that- , his; travelling.expenses: might reasonably formacharge against the Le&apos;ag-.ue. of Nations.&apos;- Such cleric al-assistants e as: may be necessary will be afforded to him by the Palestine Government.(2)    A Sac rotary who ;in the absence cf the Chairman would act as Vice-chairman.    His Majesty1s Government recommend combining the posts, of Secretary and Vice Chairman in a single member en the grounds cf ecunomy and the facilt-ation of ;busineas.    They intend to offer the combined appointment to the-Reverend P-B-waggett, S.S.J.E.VFather Waggetr possesses great
...  s oho lairs hip and. a profound knowledge of the religious -problems connected with Palestine. As Assistant&apos; Political Officer during the Military administration of. the- country be  gained tho. affect ion and coma; a riled the respect of all-communities.(3)    Six Members as follows:,   -; &quot;   &quot;-  - &apos;(a); -Two Christians, .pne of-whom--is a Catholic and &quot;   the other of the Orthodox. Commuiiion:(b) Two Moslems:.(c) Tvjo Js^s, one of whom is of the Ashkenazio Community and tho other of the Sephardie-Community.His Majesty&apos;s Government have carefully considered the two alternatives of a large. Commission upon which all interests&apos; should be represented and of the smaller body now proposed;    they are of&apos; opinion that provided the members are not Palestinians or residents&apos; in Palestine and provided T.hey are chosen as much on account of their impartiality as of their religious views the best composition is that suggested above, sectarian views- being&apos;laid before the Commission by panels especially selected by the respective communities but forming no part of tho Commission.    Moreover in a large commission there is considerable danger of delay in the transaction of business.      So long as the Commission adequately represents the three great communions of Christendom, Islam and the Jewish faith there would- seem therefore no-/sufficient reason for increasing its/size.His Majesty1 s Government also&apos; Consider that - the Palestine Government should, be rep res elite i oh the&apos; Commission-since an. impossible position would; arLce&apos; Should the Commission arrive at conclusions, whioh gravely oJfected&apos; political eon-si derations in T-Pal es tine without ..tne Government having had a prior. .oppb:r.tunIty- oif; expressing their: official views.     They propose &quot;that-,the. Seeretary-of the &quot;Commission should represent
the Palestine government-, thus- avoiding the necessityof enlarging the commission..    The incidental expensesof the Commission vd-1-1 he horns by the Palestine Goveman en twho are also prepared to afford clerical assistance to theCommission as, may, .he necessary-.&apos;His-Majesty&apos;s Government would prefer at this stage not to submit names of those whom they have in mind to invite to he members&apos; of the Commission, hut -they have no hesitation in informing the Council that the Commission which &quot;they&apos;have in view is thoroughly international in character.       His Majesty&apos;s Coverrment in not submitting names at this Juncture, are actuated solely in the interests of the Commission itself.     There may be very good personal reasons, why some of the gentlemen, to he invited to become Members may not be able to accept the invitation, and in that contingency His-&quot; Ma je sty1 s Government, would be compelled to extend invitations in other directions. .In the opinion of His Majesty&apos;s Government it would be preferable therefore to submit later the names of those Members who have finally - accepted the invitations.When the. appointment&apos; of a -Chairman, has been completed His Majesty&apos;s Government will.issue invitations to become Members of the Commission immediately,   &apos;. .His Majesty&apos;s Government emphasise once again the -necessity of setting up the Commission.as soon as possiblej The second cart of        Article 95. of the - Treaty of Sevres represents a common recognition of the&apos; need of a final  ... settlement - of&quot; the- outstanding roligious claims in palest line and: the: fact- that &quot;the Treaty has not yet been ratified does not render invalid the p-ro position that Palestine is&apos; $territory actually detached from the.. Ottoman Empire.-
Tho Council have recognised that position as valid by their letter of the 3rd October I9&quot;21 to tho Prime Minister of England convoying that the Council desired the Government to carry on the -administration of Palestine in the spirit o..&apos;: the draft mandate. -   That position then being recognised as valid in the -internal affairs  of the country His Majesty1 s Govonanent consider that there. is; even stronger ground for urging that immediate stops be taken to solve&apos; at the outset the religious problems connected with the Holy Land which have hitherto boon so fruitful a source of, internal friction and of international anxiety,,-COLONIAL OFFICE.13th May, 19 22.)
