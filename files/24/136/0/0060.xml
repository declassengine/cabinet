INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC CONFERENCEGENOA - 1922PROVISIONAL VERBATIM RECORDSECOND PLENARY SESSIONALAZZO SAN GIORGIO10. a. m. may jrd 1922.The PRESIDENT - speaking in italian: With reference to Article 12 of the Rules of Procedure of the Conference, I declare at the beginning of the Meeting that, as no Delegation has submitted any alterations to the Minutes of the First Plenary Session, they are considered as finally adopted.* *Gentlemen,The Conference decided on the occasion of its first Plenary Session to begin its labours at once, and to appoint its Commissions without delay. As you know, three Corn-missions mainly of a technical character were formed to deal with the technical matters placed on the agenda adopted at Cannes. The second Commission of the Conference was entrusted with financial questions, economic questions were assigned to the third, while the fourth was to deal with transport.Of these three Commissions two have already com-pleted their labours and have laid their report before you: the Financial Commission and the Transport Commission. It is on these reports, as well as on the draft resolutions which they contain, that the Conference is called upon to deliberate to-day.It is not my duty, gentlemen, to state again here the main lines of the conclusions at which these Commis-sions have arrived. You all know them. The relevant do-cumcnts are before you. I would merely like, in a few words, to explain the spirit which has inspired their labours, and the share in the general task of the Conference which their work represents.The agenda of the Financial Commission contained pro-blcms which keenly, even passionately interest public opi-nion. The need of a great number of countries for credits, the exchange crisis, and the fluctuations in currencies, are the most obvious symptoms of the general crisis from which Europe is suffering. The urgent need of finding a remedy for this crisis was the primary motive for summoning this Conference.It seems to me that the Financial Commission, while con-jsidering seriatim the different questions before it, in so far &quot;as their solution depended on the solution of the great political problems which were outside its terms of reference wisely contented itself with setting forth the measures which, if steadily applied, will allow of slow but real pro-;gress being made.Availing itself of the resolutions adopted by the Brussels Financial Conference, which in many points serve as basis for its own work, the Commission considered con-secutively the problems of currency, exchange and credits.The Transport Commission had to consider a series of most important and urgent problems. Pending the re-establishment of transport facilities, at least as favourable as those which existed before the war, Europe cannot be expected to overcome the present crisis.Material causes, and, if I may say so, causes of a political nature also, may prevent this re-establishment. It has, therefore, appeared essential to the Transport Corn-mission to suggest methods for gradually restoring the means of transport in Europe and, at the same time, to lay down principles of international control which, without infringing the sovereign rights of States, may avoid disabled-agreements which might interfere with the good organisation &quot; of international transport.I am not called upon to enter into details which can be better explained by the Presidents of the Commissions. So far as I am concerned, I do not hesitate to say, gentle-men, that at the present stage of our labours we can warmly congratulate ourselves, on the fact that our task has been brought so speedily to a successful conclusion by two of our Technical Commissions. Within a few weeks they have succeeded on the problems referred to them in reaching an agreement, embodied in carefully drafted resolutions.They have thereby shown that in spite of difficulties of another kind, the men of good-will of all nations who are assembled here were ready to come to an under-standing in all good faith. That spirit of agreement is a good omen for the rest of our work and for the solution of the political problems to which we are devoting all our ef-forts, with a view to the re-establishment of mutual confi-dence and of fruitful co-operation between our various countries.The Conference is therefore achieving the objects it had in view. An assembly which deals with the gravest in-ternational questions cannot accomplish its purpose unless all its members are resolutely determined to create an at-mosphere of conciliation in which the interests of the seve-ral nations may be studied in a spirit of absolute equity and justice.These conditions have been realised at the present Con-ference; this is why the attention of the world is fixed on it with ever growing hope and confidence. We must avail ourselves to the full of this confidence.  Our assembly
should teach a great lesson and set a bright example to all peoples. The rapidity and success of the work of recon-struction which all desire to see carried out will largely depend on the serenity and spirit of harmony which we dis-play, and which will show that we are prepared to over-come the inevitable difficulties involved in the problems be-fore us.The work so far accomplished clearly shows that the Conference in its deliberations has been guided by a com-mon purpose and controlled by a self-imposed discipline.We may therefore proceed with our labours with confidence and serenity.* *I now call upon the President of the Financial Corn-mission.Sir LAMING WORTHINGTON-EVANS (British Empire) -speaking in English:Mr. President,I beg to move the adoption of the Report of the Financial Commission appointed by this great Conference at its first Plenary Session.The Report itself, on the first page of the document before you, recites the activities of the various Sub-Com-missions and Committees of Experts set up to consider in detail the various important questions with which the Finan-cial Commission has had to deal.The resolutions come to by the Commission, which this Conference is asked to adopt, constitute a financial code not less important to the world to-day than was the civil code of Justinian.The Institutes of Justinian have been the basis of the jurisprudence of not merely a large part of Europe but of the world itself.Here at Genoa there have been assembled experts in finance and economics, each known in his own country as the leading authority upon the subjects with which we are dealing, and their combined wisdom after a full review of the conditions of Europe and after a full discussion of what in the circumstances is possible, has resulted in agreement upon a series of resolutions which will be a guide, and I hope a code, to be followed and observed in the same way as the laws due to the learning of Justinian.Italy laid the foundation of the civil law upon which Napoleon built. May we not also hope that in Italy again, upon the code laid down at Genoa, the financial and eco-nomic reconstruction of Europe may be founded and pursued?No town could have been better chosen; no place could have been better selected in Genoa than the Palace of San Giorgio, where the first International Bank was founded; where the instruments of credit, bills of exchange, and cheques, were first invented;   for the restatement in authoritative form of those principles upon which the credit of Europe can be restored, and the free interchange of the products of skill and labour can be made available regard-Jess of national boundaries.I venture to think that the Financial Commission has accomplished a great work.What was the problem before it ? To find a remedj for the derangement of money and credit, to which the interruption of commerce, the depression of trade and tht widespread unemployment from which the world is suffering are in great part due.It was necessary to recognise from the beginning thai the malady was too deep-seated and had gained too great  a hold for any immediate or simple cure to be possible The Resolutions which have been adopted do not preteni to provide such a cure. They do no more than point tin way for a process of gradual recuperation.Nevertheless they mark a stage. ,It is instructive to compare them with the resolution! passed at the Financial Conference held at Brussels in 1920H At that Conference much sound doctrine was enunciateH and was impressed on public opinion with all the authorilfl of the assembled experts of Europe. Some of the resolution^ we have passed echo those of Brussels, but even thouglH a reiteration of sound principles may again have value, take  world would have been disappointed, and rightly so, 1 Genoa had produced nothing but an echo. Genoa one] again has sounded a note of its own.If you will allow me I will endeavour to explain tit main features of the resolutions proposed.The evils we have set out to examine are the fluctual tions in internal currencies, the consequent oscillations i external exchange and resulting obstacles to international credits.The three subjects -- currency, exchange and credit!   are so dependent the one upon the other that the pro] posed remedies are rightly contained in one report.Unless the currency of a country is reasonably stable! by which I mean, is freed from violent and frequent rise! and falls, it is impossible to measure either the value oQ labour or its products, and it is consequently impossible I exchange those products for the products of other countries! however much they may require them, upon any businesfl basis except subject to the strict limitations of a systet] of barter.Business between such countries ceases to be businessH and becomes a speculation or even a gamble.The report advises that gold should be adopted as tnf common standard, but it is recognised that this is noS immediately possible and the advice is given that the estafcl lishment of a gold standard should be declared to be thl ultimate object, and that a programme should be agreed byg which this object should be achieved.The programme is set out in some detail in the resoj resolutions.First the obstacles are frankly dealt with, and then thel means of economising gold and the machinery for an inter! national convention, both for centralising the demand for! gold and avoiding wide fluctuations in the purchasing powel of gold, are described.Let me examine the obstacles.The main obstacle in stabilising the value of a currency^ is an obvious one.So long as an indefinite increase in the amount oil currency is possible there can be no stable value; it ill therefore essential that the output of the printing presij should be limited, and that the annual expenditure of everjj State should be balanced by taxation.
IS0.tyis ?li lie if ceheia in riallits ro-ilc, ses of! tOics,iCSSIlessthe nottab thelbyesothe iter-for! jweriThe true remedy is the reduction of State expenditure to the point at which it can be met out of taxation paid out of income.But this remedy may, for the moment, be unattainable, o the report recognises that as a temporary expedient Internal loans may be necessary.The next obstacle dealt with is the great depreciation in some currencies. Stability however does not depend upon any particular parity to gold.Stability in some countries may be found at pre-war parity, and in others it may be wiser to fix a new parity Inoro nearly approximating to the present exchange value of the monetary unit.National pride may hinder the adoption of a new parity, but the report rightly emphasises the undoubted fact that the essential requisite is the achievement by each country of stability in the value of its currency.It is a mistake to suppose a return to the gold stan-dard is a solution of all our difficulties, or that it is only in countries where inflation is still going on, and where currency is in a state of collapse, that a serious monetary problem exists to be solved.In reality countries with sound currencies have problems almost equally formidable to deal wi:h.Since the war, prices of commodities have displayed the wildest fluctuations, not only in European countries with paper currencies, but also in the United States, with its gold currency.There is general agreement among experts that one of the most prominent causes of depression of trade and of unemployment is the fall of prices which has occurred in the past two years.In the resolutions which have been passed under the Head of Currency, there is embodied the principle of pre-venting undue fluctuations in the purchasing power of gold, a^nd therefore equally in the purchasing power of currencies based on gold.If this policy can be put successfully into operation, the price changes, which have caused so grave an unsettle-ment in trade both in America and in Western Europe, will [become less frequent and less violent.The price changes to which I refer are changes in the general level of prices, changes which affect all commodities $pgether.In recent years we have learnt to distinguish such Ebanges from casual changes in individual commodities. 1   Regulation of prices in this sense means regulation of redit.I The experience both of the Bank of Engtand and of Ije Federal Reserve Board in the United States since theencjMar has demonstrated afresh the sensitiveness of prices to fredit conditions.Thus the power to influence prices, and the responsi-Wlity for using that power, belong to the great central banks. Ititpress jverjIn currency policy they are the directing intelligence, id therefore the first practical step to be taken will be the ijjpeting of these central banks which is to be called by the nk of England. It may be hoped that the result of that meeting will be ljch co-ordination of credit policy throughout the world1as will enable the great banks to make the general level of prices more stable.This policy pre-supposes the general return to the gold standard.Nevertheless in the interval before that general return has been completed, the co-operation of central banks can undoubtedly do much to introduce stability and confidence into business.Moreover the existence of a credit-policy properly co-ordi-nated and directed to a concerted end will remove obstacles from the path of countries which arc still using a paper standard, but are endeavouring to return to gold.Thus a remedy will be provided for the distress from which both classes of countries are suffering.On the one hand, in those countries which arc suffer-ing from unemployment, traders will be able to make their plans, confident that their markets will not be deranged by any sudden contraction or unhealthy expansion in the purchasing power of their customers.On the other hand countries which take the painful first step towards regaining control of their currencies by balancing their budgets will be secure that their plans will not be upset unexpectedly through credit storms originating in the sound currency countries.This will facilitate the restoration of conditions in which commercial transactions can be effected, even in the dis-tressed countries, under something approaching normal con-ditions.The policy embodied in the resolutions might be regar-ded as sufficiently defined by the resolutions themselves. .Nevertheless the Finance Commission have indicated a further step which will help in carrying the policy out.They have suggested that there should be an Internatio-nal Convention, and have remitted to the meeting of central banks the consideration and the technical elaboration of a scheme for such a Convention.The scheme is based on the most modern and scienti-fic method of economising the use of gold as currency.I should perhaps add that the principle of stabilising the purchasing power of gold is the necessary complement of this scheme, since otherwise economy in the use of gold might be carried to such a extent as to bring about a serious inflation of prices.An invitation has been extended to the United States to co-operate.Indeed, without American co-operation the proposals cannot be carried out.Europe, even with the assistance of Japan and other extra-European gold-using countries, cannot stabilise the purchasing power of gold, if that means counteracting fluc-j tuations arising from so vast a gold-using area as the United States, which contains little less than half the gold currency of the world.But America herself has suffered severely from instability-bility in the value of gold.And here is a field in which she can both give and; receive invaluable assistance without involving herself :in any political difficulties and without being called upon to make any sacrifice.The co-operation among central banks, which we look forward to, is not to be embodied in any rigid agreement.
s -That would be as ill-suited to the methods and tradi-tions of the several European central banks as to the Fe-deral Reserve Board itself.What is contemplated is a continuous exchange of ideas, which will enable each Central Bank to conduct its credit policy with adequate knowledge of the credit policy of its associates.All will thus be enabled to combine to follow the com-mon aim of stabilisation.The Resolutions to which I have referred form a cur-rency code. The essentials are the limitation of the issue of paper currency, the fixing of a parity with gold, the eco-nomising of the use of gold, and the co-ordination of credit policy designed to prevent fluctuations in the commodity value of gold,This then is the code of Genoa.I will turn now to the subject of the exchanges. It is generally recognised that stabilisation of the exchanges is a branch of the problem of currency.Given stability in the internal value of the currency, stability in the exchanges will easily follow.The resolutions dealing with exchange are accordingly limited to that part of the subject which does not overlap with the currency resolutions.The primary recommendation repeats and elaborates that made at the Brussels Conference against artificial con-trol of exchange operations.But an interval of time must pass before the stabilisation-tion of the exchanges by means of currency reform can be realised, and with a view to mitigating the harmful effects of exchange fluctuations during that interval, the Exchange Sub-Commission have added a useful proposal for a techni-cal improvement in the exchange market, which by facilita-ting the purchase and sale of future exchange, will, it is hoped, limit in one direction the exchange risks which in-terfere so seriously with the free flow of trade.The remaining resolutions deal with credits. When cur-currencies have been stabilised and exchanges are freed from wild fluctuations investible capital will flow freely from countries where there is a surplus lending capacity to coun-tries which are in need of external assistance.Capital will indeed seek remuneration where it is need-ed as soon as conditions are restored under which it can safely operate.The resolutions lay down the conditions and point out the steps that are necessary to secure them.The final Resolution recommends that the Governments represented at this Conference should support the establish-ment and facilitate the operations of the Central Interna-tional Corporation and National Corporations affiliated to it.Much progress has already been made in the organisa-tion of these Corporations.Twelve of the Governments represented here have pledg-ed themselves subject to the approval of their Parliaments to found National Corporations and to secure the subscriptions-tion of the required capital.The total capital to be subscribed in the moneys of the different countries will be the equivalent of * 20.000.000 sterling.The capital will be under the control of the Central International Corporation  which will  be registered  underthe British Company Laws and managed by a Board of Directors nominated by the affiliated national companies.The main object of the Central International Corpora-tion will be to render financial and technical facilities in the reconstruction of Europe. It will co-operate with existing and new institutions, without any attempt at creating a mo-nopoly, in hastening forward works of public utility and and developing undertakings in countries whose conditions offer sufficient security for productive enterprise.It may be thought that the capital is insufficient, but it should be remembered that behind the national corporations stand the vast resources of all those countries from which specific undertakings approved and supported by the Cen-tral International Corporation can be financed.I venture to think that the Resolutions recommended to this Conference are worthy of acceptance ; they have! been adopted by the Financial Commission after hearing the opinion and taking the advice of the best-known experts of world-wide experience and reputation.The Resolutions contain practical proposals, the carrying! out of some of which is immediately possible, although others will have to be postponed, but when sooner or lata they are put into operation the impediments now obstruct-ing financial and industrial intercourse between the people of the world will tend to disappear and the flow of capi-tal and the interchange of the products of labour will, once more be freely resumed.The PRESIDENT - speaking in Italian:A general debate is now open on the question dealt! with by the Report of the Commission. I call on M. Picardl to speak.M. PICARD (France) - speaking in French:I rise to speak here because I represented the Frencll Delegation on the Financial Commission, and because thai; Delegation has given its adhesion to the recommendation; now submitted to the Conference for its approval.I feel it my duty to explain why we have thus giya our adhesion, and have, at the same time, made certain obser vations which are noted in the -minutes of the Sub-Comniis sions on Currency, Exchange, and Credits.The recommendations laid before you are of two kind? some are of lasting significance, and appeal to the grea&apos; principles on which the financial system of any countr should be based; others deal with temporary measures dt manded by the present state of Europe and, one may add of the world.There are some who have smiled at a reference fi monetary and financial principles, saying that what * needed was not a course of moral instruction but discovery of practical remedies.Such persons fail to recognise that morality has a praij tical application. A man who wishes to strengthen or rebuili a house must first ascertain that its foundations are secure-The foundations of all monetary and financial constructs are moral.To adjust normal expenditure to normal resources honour obligations incurred; to pay debts in a current] which is not depreciated at the very moment it is tisi because it is artificially created by all too rapid printii
fPLd, to attain those results, to shrink from no effort, no sacrifice - it is well to recall such, principles as these in this ancient and illustrious City of Genoa, whose prospe-rity was founded on trade, in other words, on the mutual honouring of agreements whether oral or in writing. It is well to recall them in this building, which, as Sir Laming Worthington-Evans has reminded us, housed one of the most famous banks in the world, which for five hundred years maintained these great principles of financial morality.Your Commission has not confined itself to this theo-retical statement, essential though that be. It did not wish to incur the reproach addressed by our fable writer La Fontaine to the schoolmaster who, seeing a child drowning, olemnly read him a lesson on the causes and conseqnenc es of his folly, without first giving him a helping hand to bring him to the bank.Your Commission has given a hand to those who asked for help, and the French Delegation has given its pport to the two groups of practical measures proposed by the Commission.The first consists of an enquiry undertaken by the1 banks of issue into the most suitable means of introducing some stability into the disordered movements of the exchanges.The programme submitted with this object to the meeting of the banks is very comprehensive; it does not involve their adhesion in advance to the systems considered, although some of us thought that the report presented by the economic experts to the Sub-Commission on Currency appeared to lay too much emphasis on certain theories. We have not concealed this opinion, and we do not in-tend to withdraw anything we have said on this subject.This programme   constitutes  a  scheme of practical jenquiry which the experts of the banks of issue will have elaborate, and in doing so it is the intention of your cncllConiinission to leave them the completest independence.have no doubt that these enquiries will lead to useful reforms, the beneficial effect of which will shortly be felt. We have also given our adhesion to the project of an giveinternational Corporation, while observing that, the carrying ibserjitit of this scheme would be conditional on the obtaining authority im certain cases. We have learnt with satisfac-ion that a large number of States are desirous of assisting this undertaking. The French Delegation wishes, in conclusion, to thank the w^rfresidents 0f the Financial Commission, Sir Robert Home [nd Sir Laming Worthington-Evans, for the courtesy, autho-(ity and energy with which they .have directed our labours.If the Commission is not able to submit to you recom-endations capable of putting an end in twenty-four hours the existing monetary and financial difficulties, it is not for ant of serious consideration or wise direction, but because fere is in fact no magic wand which can exempt humanity &quot;in labour and effort.Icalt cardthai tion;mmisifrkindsBngreal2S del f adnee[t W8at tia pra rebuil secun rtictio1ces jirrew1The PRESIDENT - speaking in Italian: I call upon M. Schanzer, Delegate of Italy, to speak.M. SCHANZER (Italy) - speaking in,French:There can be no doubt that the Resolutions submitted Irintiti&apos; the Financial Commission provide a complete and prac-tical scheme for the re-organisation of European finance, which has been so seriously affected by the war. We are . all aware of the troubles which at present affect the world , and we can all realize the dangers by which we shall be menaced if we do not succeed, without loss of time, in tak-ing energelic measures to ensure a return to normal eco-nomic conditions. By their knowledge and experience, the experts have shown us the way to achieve our object. They have pointed out the means which we must employ without hesitation and without delay to put an end to the present dangerous situatiom and to avoid disasters even greater than those from which we have suffered in the past.But it is our task, gentlemen, as statesmen, to make the effort necessary to save ourselves; it is for us all to show that decision and force of purpose which are essential , for the realisation of the principles which the technical experts and the Financial Commission have submitted for our approval. It cannot after all be denied that at the root of every financial problem there lies a moral, a political problem.We are recommended to stabilise public expenditure in order to avoid the opening of new credits, we are advised to reduce expenditure. But is not the reduction of expen-diture a moral problem ? The reduction of expenditure means the abandonment of all the selfish and excessive claims and pretensions of the individuals, groups and classes which are all eager for improved conditions. In many countries the concessions which are thus rendered necessary result in increased expenditure, which cannot be compensated for by increased taxation beyond a certain limit. In all countries since the war, instead of a tendency towards thrift and careful living, there has unfortunately been a tendency towards luxury, pleasure and dissipation, especially-cially amongst the social classes which should give to other classes an example of moderation and of a clear realisa-tion of the vital needs of the State and of society.It is, however, the political aspect of the problem to which we must chiefly devote our attention. The balancing of our Budgets which is essential if we are to avoid inflation-tion and depreciation of the currency, depends upon the general and political attitude of each country. It is only by a policy of peace, mutual goodwill and international co-ope-ration, and by the strictest economy in public expenditure that we can hope to obtain that budgetary equilibrium which has been justly described as the essential basis of all financial reconstruction.In this connection, gentlemen, I would like to call your attention to the policy which has been followed by Italy since the war, and to the efforts which have been made by the Italian people to overcome the great financial clifficul-ties which have resulted from the war.It is hardly necessary to state that Italian policy has always been based upon a sincere desire for peace, and that Italy has regarded the problem of the financialand eco-nomic reconstruction of the country as the most urgent ques-tion which confronts her.Our taxation to-day is six times greater than it was before the war; direct taxation is nine times greater. Our budgetary deficit which three years ago had reached a total of 24 milliards of lire is now reduced to three milliards. We have reduced our army to a total of 200.000 men only.
- Io  We have considered the reduction of our expenditure not only as a duty towards ourselves but also as a duty towards other nations, whose normal economic life and prosperity are intimately bound up with the economic and political stability of each member of the international ^society.Italy therefore has proved, by her legislative and poli-tical work, and by the heavy sacrifices made by her tax-payers, that she has fully realised the duties of the hour. We have not been able to attain complete budgetary equi-librium, but we shall not shrink from the necessary sacrifice-fice and reduction of expenditure, so long as our object is unattained.I have spoken only of the efforts made by Italy, but I am well aware that similar efforts have been made in other counlries. Henceforward, our rivalry must consist not in unnecessary or dangerous expenditure, but in economy and prudence. That is the principle with which I would con-clude my speech.I think, gentlemen, that we should consider the valua-ble work which has been done by the Financial Commis-sion as an introduction to the political work which we must accomplish. Ours is a great and noble task, and the eyes of the whole world are upon us. The world is looking to us to bring about the pacification of men&apos;s minds, to establish lasting guarantees of peace, and to re-establish international economic collaboration. Unless all our efforts are directed to the realisation of these lofty aims, the re-commendations of the Financial Commission will have been made in vain.I would conclude my speech on a note of sincere op-timism. In these few weeks at Genoa, we have already held interesting and delicate discussions, we have-already over-come considerable political difficulties. We have all made sacrifices to conform to each other&apos;s points of view, and we have worked in the true spirit of this Conference, which is, and which must be, a spirit of peace, conciliation and international goodwill.I can therefore conclude, gentlemen, by expressing my entire and unshakeable confidence in the success of our work, which I am convinced will mark the commencement of a new era of European history, a period of sincere and whole-hearted collaboration for the well-being of peoples and for the progress of humanity.The PRESIDENT - speaking in Italian:I call upon Jonkheer Van Karnebeek, Delegate of the Netherlands, to speak.jonkheer Van KARNEBEEK (Netherlands) - speaking in French:May I be permitted, Mr. President, to add a few words to the vote which the Netherlands Delegation intends to give to the resolutions which the Second Commission has submitted to our attention.When the Netherlands Government learned the pro-gramme of the Genoa Conference, the proposals relating to financial questions did not fail to rouse its keenest interest. In the course of the last years, international monetary problems have, in the Netherlands, formed the subject of thorough study.on.the part of competent  men,and I may be allowed to recall to you the well-known&apos; memorandum drawn up in 1920 at Amsterdam, to which men of prominent position in the domain of the financial theory and practice of various countries lent their collabora-tion and the prestige of their names.We have now before us the results of the work of the Second Commission, and the Netherlands Delegation wishes to adhere entirely and unreservedly to the conclii-sions of that Commission. On various points of capital importance an understanding has been reached in spite of the difficulties and complexity of the problems. As an essential condition, among others, to the economic reconstruction of Europe, it has been set forth that each State should succeed in balancing its budget. A detailed programme has been elaborated which points out to each country the way to re-establish the effective gold standard, With reference to the delicate problem of devaluation of monetary units, a happy formula has been found which takes into account divergent conditions in the various coun-tries. Co-operation of wide importance between Central Banks of Issue may be looked forward to in the near future as the first tangible result of the Conference.The participation in the Genoa Conference of so large a number of States, represented by their most prominenl specialists, lends a commanding moral prestige to the con&apos; elusions of the Conference. The work of Brussels has been surpassed, and the Netherlands Delegation hopes that these results will mark the beginning of the restoration of Eur-ope, the economic equilibrium of which has been so pro foundly shaken.As the Commission of Experts stated in its report, there can be no hope of final success in restoring the cup currencies or the economic welfare of Europe until the sub-jects to which the memorandum of 1920 refers, and in par-ticular the problem of inter-Governmental indebtedness, have been resolutely tackled.In fact, the problem of international debts dominates the economic situation of Europe. So long as this problem has not been solved by the parties directly concerned -and among these is the great American Republic - the most salutary and incontestable financial principles remain mere economic morality, whatever may be the strength with which such principles are set forth, or whatever the sinccritj of the endeavours of the nations to secure their application,We have come to Genoa accompanied by the wishes and hopes of many peoples. Under the menace of the grow-ing economic crisis, the peoples follow our deliberations with the hope of seeing the rise of new and better realities, The Netherlands Delegation expresses the wish that the Genoa Conference, whose Second Commission could do no more than it accomplished, will be followed in the near fif ture by the realisation of the new circumstances and solu-tions indispensable for the definite re-establishment of i state of economic stabilisation and repose, enabling Europi to recover confidence, and to draw, in a spirit of concord, the full benefit of the important work achieved in thj hospitable^city.The PRESIDENT - speaking in Italian:I call upon M. Schulthess, Delegate of Switzerland, to speak.
M. SCHULTHESS - (Switzerland) - speaking in French:The Swiss &quot;Delegation declares its complete adhesion lo the resolutions voted by the Financial Commission, and also supports the declarations made by the Netherlands Delegation.The Swiss Delegation is, in particular, of opinion that Ihe proposed meeting of Central Banks and the per-jiianent co-operation between these Banks will be such as o exercise a beneficial effect in the future on the exchange narket, and to facilitate to some extent credit operations.The Swiss Delegation views with satisfaction the for-liiation in the immediate future of an International Financial Corporation, and of National Associations whose activity, f it is well directed, should have beneficial&apos; effects on the economic reconstruction of Europe.We fully recognise the technical value and the impor-iance of the conclusions which the Financial Commission las come to regarding currency reform, and the conditions jdiicli it is desirable to lay down for the granting of credits.But we must take note of the fact that the majority if these resolutions are not immediately applicable, and lhat, in order to restore the confidence so necessary to all jommercial, financial and industrial operations between States, I is necessary first to solve various problems of a political, social and moral character.On the other hand, and without in any way wishing [to anticipate the results which may be arrived at by the iconomic Commission, the Swiss Delegation takes the liberty emphasising the fact that economic and financial ques-jons are not separated at the present time into water-ight compartments, but that such questions, and particularly those relating to currency and exchange, affect to the reatest possible extent the whole economic situation.Thus the principle ifactors in pre-war commercial policy, iistoms duties on imports, and on exports, and import facilities or restrictions, no longer possess the same relative portance, if we compare them with the importance of iirrency depreciaton in various countries, and the rapid Bid sudden fluctuation of the exchanges.States whose currency is continually depreciated are us enabled to compete ruinously with other nations, and ch countries are practically closed to the importation of nufactured articles. This fact constitutes one of the prin-al causes of the dangerous crisis from which Europe is ffering, and which is manifested chiefly by unemployment countries with a healthy or relatively healthy currency, d by the excessive reduction in purchasing and consuming wer in those countries whose currency has depreciated a considerable extent.The resolutions of the Financial Commission, however icious and wise they may be. are not of a nature, alas, bring about an immediate solution of such problems, or en a solution in the very near future.Nevertheless, the Genoa   Conference has raised the jeatest hopes throughout the world; and the situation at present time is grave, and threatens to become Worse, n beyond remedy, if some means are not found for &apos;pillaring the present currency situation. ......One of the principal causes of currency depreciation 1^ of the fall in the exchanges certainly arises from the t of international indebtedness, and, as the Experts&apos;Report most wisely points out, there is no hope of re-establishing European currencies and the economic welfare of Europe as a whole, before the problem of international indebtedness has been resolutely tackled.The solution, or solutions, of this problem are not within the competence of the Genoa Conference, and the work which has been performed by it can only be consi-dered as preparatory; but we take the liberty, in conformity with the initiative of the Netherlands Delegation, of expressing the hope that those who are entrusted with directing the destinies of the nations will not hesitate to take this pro-blem into consideration, and to solve it by means of a common agreement before it becomes too late; for the economic restoration of this Continent depends in a large measure upon the solutions which may be found for this problem.The PRESIDENT - speaking in Italian:I call upon M. Tchitcherin, Delegate of Russia, to speak.M. TCHITCHERIN (Russia) - speaking in French: The adoption of the Resolutions which have been submitted to-day by the second and fourth Commissions is the first general international act in which Russia has taken part during the last four years. This event marks an itnpor-tant stage, but it involves the necessity of making certain explanations and certain reservations arising out of the special international position which Russia has occupied during the past few years, and which she still, in a large measure, continues to occupy. The Russian Delegation has done its utmost to participate in the work of the various Commissions, but it has felt from the first that the situa-tion has to some extent limited the possibility of its achie-ving results, that it was prevented from participating to the fullest extent in the new ideas due to historic evolution, or from contributing its proper share to the general content of such ideas. For one thing, the work of many past inter-national conferences and commissions, which have been studying these subjects during the last few years, was not available for the Russian Government. You must remember that we have not even semi-official representatives in a great number of States, and it has been difficult, if not impossible, to obtain information about a great deal of work which has recently been accomplished. Nevertheless, much has been accomplished in the Commissions. At the same time, I wish to emphasise the reservations which have been made by the Russian Delegation, and which are recorded in the Minutes of the Commissions; I wish to declare that these reservations are maintanied. The Russian Government reserves its complete and full liberty of action with regard to these resolutions, which pre-suppose co-operation in financial matters with the League of Nations or its Organisations, since the League of Nations is a body which has not been recognised by Russia. The Russian Delegation also desires to emphasise the fact that, owing to the peculiar situation of Russia from the point of view of foreign trade, it- is not possible for her Government to renounce control over exchange operations, in spite of the fact that such control is declared in the Report to be futile and mischievous. Though agreeing that the recon-struction of Europe is only possible, by means of financial
assistance to be accorded by the stronger states to the weaker states, we consider that this assistance should not only be accorded by means of private credits, but also by loans between Government and Government. The passage in paragraph 19 of the Report gives authority for this to be done, in the case which applies to Russia.As regards Paragraph 19, tlie Russian Delegation de-sires to insist that, if international corporations are formed, as is proposed, they must keep entirely and absolutely with-in the limits which are laid down for them; that is to say, that they must not be of such a nature as to create any form of monopoly. We pay all homage to the observation of the Italian Delegation that it is only by a policy of peace that the nations will be enabled to balance their budgets. We agree in particular that the reconstruction of the world depends upon a policy of general disarmament, and that in this matter the general interests of the whole world must be given precedence over private interests or group interests. The Russian Delegation will advise its Government to carry out, within the limits of its powers, the decisions which have been adopted by these Commis-sions; but I must repeat that Russia is placed in a some-what difficult position, because some of the decisions of these Commissions have been confided to organisations of the League of Nations, which, as 1 have said, Russia has not recognised. With this reserve, the Russian Delegation adheres to the proposals of the second and fourth Coin-missions.In conclusion, I desire to express my conviction that it is only by economic collaboration between two worlds whose policy is based on differing economic systems that we can trace the path towards reconstruction and peace.The PRESIDENT - speaking in Italian:I call upon Dr. Rathenau, Delegate of Germany, to speak.Dr. RATHENAU (Germany) - speaking in French: Gentlemen,The world will find with satisfaction that the Conimis-sion wh:se conclusions have just been read has done excellent scientific work. They have found formulae for the solution of serious financial and economic questions which surpass anything one could have imagined. The Financial Commission has very rightly alluded to ideas of a similar nature which certain Governments proposed so long ago as January 1920. One sees, therefore, that these ideas have been propagated for the last two years, but unfortunately they have never been put into practice. Since 1920, the world market has deteriorated in a most deplorable way. World trade, which in 1920 was still nearly the same and of the same importance as before the war, has decreased continuously during 1921 ; it has decreased by at least one-third, if not even by one half, as compared with its pre-war volume. This decrease of international sales reveals a constant reduction in purchasing power, a reduction which, in many parts of the world, has caused unemployment of extreme duration and extent. The Sub-Commission on Labour Questions has stated that there are at present in the world nearly ten million unemployed. If you include the families of the unemployed, the total represents a whole civilised people, whose members are animated by an anxious desire to work, but who are unable to do so. The reasons for this deplorable situation have been clearly shown by the bestl experts in the world, who have met here at Genoa. The chief reason is the enormous burden arising from the obli-gations imposed by the war. Tiie fact that these charges; have to be met has given rise to economic difficulties, which certain post-war political measures have made still worse, The experts   say that if a country is obliged to fulfil I certain obligations with regard to other countries, those! obligations ought to be settled, or there ought to be al possibility of settling them, through the sale of goods andl commodities. To effect such sales, it is necessary  to have&apos; markets with sufficiently developed purchasing power. The purchasing power of world markets to-day is not sufficiently! great to enable the debts of the whole world to be satis-1 fied in such a way. We have drawn up figures, based, oil course, on estimates, but still correct within certain  limits, I which show that the total amount of world export ought I to be doubled in order to allow for the payment of interest I on war debts contracted by the principal States, and inl order to make some provision for amortisation. The world I market to-day, far fiom having been doubled, is at present; reduced to two-thirds of its importance as compared with. pre-war conditions, if it has not already fallen to one half.I The financial and economic consequences resulting fromE this are deplorable. The enormous burden under which I European nations are groaning must lead, on the one hand,! to a disturbance of the markets in creditor countries and, I on the other hand, to the constant depreciation of currency I in debtor countries. Added to that, there is a &quot;continual I reduction in purchasing power throughout the world. We arc I moving in a vicious circle. Debtor countries are obliged tog procure foreign money through exporting their commodities! and find themselves in bitter competition with their credi-s; tors on the same markets. The debtor countries arc still&apos;&apos;; more bound to sell than the creditors, and cannot sell enough. That is the reason why their currency is going] down; the fact that it does go down brings about a tern-l porary fall in the price of their goods and commodities,! but such forced sales do not produce for the countries con;; cerned either  sufficient means to live or a purchasing; power which will be of benefit to them. The debtor couivi tries must hand over a large part of the foreign paper they secure by sales of their goods to the creditor countries.&apos; In spite of arduous work, the value of their currency goes down, and they have not enough left to provide for theil own needs. Their purchasing power diminishes, and the world market is reduced to the sam; extent. The creditor countries, in order to protect their own industry, set upl as against importation from debtor countries, barriers oil prohibitions and taxes on imports. The debtors, obliged to procure means of payment whatever happens, are oblige! to reduce again the value of their goods, and hence a nos. 1 fall takes place in the value of the currency of debtOjjJ countries, and a new cause.arises of unemployment in creditor countries   new measures, of commercial competition an. struggle.Thus, through a vicious circle, the burden of intend tional indebtedness converts every measure of defence into
an aggravation of the circumstances against which it was designed.This will not cease unless men no longer act like those who, pent up in a narrow room, rush at each other&apos;s throats, instead of coming to a common agreement which will allow them all to escape.The theory is clearly recognised and has already been stated in part for some time, but what has been lacking so far is its practical application. Our experts tell us that the crisis may be overcome by a combination of financial and economic measures. The restoration of the exchanges is the primary condition; the restoration of trade markets will automatically follow. In any event, it will be necessary to come to the assistance of the weaker nations. The stability of their exchanges is the indispensable preliminary to the restoration of their purchasing power and to the res-lorution of the world market, the indispensable prelimi-nary to a new economic and technical progress, and even-lually to the maintenance of civilisation itself. It will there-fore be necessary to combine closely financial and economic measures, and what is most important, it will be necessary lo utilise them &apos;and to put them into practice as soon as possible. The world does not expect merely theses and iheories from the Genoa Conference. We still hope that the representatives of the great nations will, as regards economic and social needs of the greatest urgency, firmly resolve upon energetic, efficacious and immediate co-operation.The PRESIDENT - speaking in Italian:The general debate is now closed, and the meeting will pass to the discussion of the several articles of the proposals submitted by the Financial Commission. I will now &quot;read out the numbers of these Articles. As you all have &apos;jthe text, I do not consider it necessary to read the text, &quot;%it will give the numbers of the Articles. If no one wishes Jo speak on an Article, it is understood that the Article in uestion is approved. If any Delegate wishes to speak on &quot;In Article, then he must ask permission to speak when the lumber of the Article on which he wishes to speak is s&apos;lead out.&apos;    The subject is the resolutions of the Financial Commis-iion. If no observations are made, the Article is approved.n-r\elResolutions 1-7 were adopted. ** *The PRESIDENT - speaking in Italian: I call upon M. Bertone, Delegate of Italy, to speak.M. BERTONE (Italy) - speaking in Italian:The Resolutions of the Financial Commission contain jne central point to which all other questions are subordi-ited. It figures among the questions submitted for exami-convention by the Conference in virtue of the Cannes Resolu-anUons. It. deals with the report on public finance.Regarding the question of the reform of public finance rn J Hie different States, the Italian Delegation had the honour submitting  some proposals in a draft which it pre-Iptcd to the Conference. The substance of these proposalsint&apos;is reproduced in the Resolutions adopted by the Sub-Com-missions on Currency and Credits.There-establishment of public finance is the indispensable preliminary to currency reform in ttie different States. This is the goal towards which the efforts of the Governments concerned should be directed. But financial reform does not merely imply an increase of revenue; it means above all a reduction of budgetary burdens, if the sources of revenue in various States are not to be dried up by the imposition of excessive pressure of taxation. This point of view is embodied in the seventh Resolution of the Financial Commission. Therefore, if the recommendations of the Com-mission are to be accepted by the Governments concerned, it is essential that all States should immediately undertake the task of enforcing the most vigilant economy.It is true that measures of this sort concern the internal policy of the various States, and that each of these is free to exercise its action in this sphere as it thinks fit. Never-theless, in drafting its resolutions, the Financial Commission decided to indicate the procedure which seemed most appro-priate for achieving these results. It also expressed the hope, in Resolution 17, that those countries which need credits, to assist them out of the unfavourable situation in which they now iind themselves, should furnish proof that they have made the requisite efforts to reform their public finances.The Commission^ recommendation in this connection was necessary if the resolutions dealing with financial reform in the various States were not to appear merely an academic repetition of principles known to all and of formulae al-ready adopted, but should really possess a greater value than this, by showing the firm intention of the Confe-rence to urge the nations who are most affected by the present economic crisis to devote themselves resolutely to the work of financial reform, because an effort in this direction will be required of them as a necessary condition of securing financial assistance from other States.In this connection, the Commission recognises that a knowledge of the financial conditions prevailing in various States is a necessary factor in the creation and maintenance of mutual confidence.An existing organisation - the League of Nations - has been entrusted with the task of undertaking the co-ordination and publication of information concerning the budgetary sit-uation in the various States. This information will be pub-lished periodically, when transmitted to the League by the States concerned.In order that this recommendation may have a more gen-eral and a wider scope, it is desired that thejptiblications in question should deal not only with States Members of the League, but with all States.The relevant resolutions of the Commission are sub-stantially the same as those submitted by the Italian Dele-gation in the Memorandum which it has drawn up in respect of public finance; and, as is the case with all the other resolutions of the Financial Commission, they have the full support of Italy.May the action consequent upon these resolutions contribute tribute to the restoration of international relations in the widest and the most complete sense, to the fresh develop-
ment of economic life throughout the world, and to the welfare of all nations.** *Articles 6&apos;-AV were adopted.  .* *The PRESIDENT - speaking in Italian:I call upon M. Gomes, Delegate of Portugal, to speak.M. GOMES (Portugal) - speaking in French:As the flight of capital is one of the chief causes of the speculation which at present prevails, and of the rapid fall of the exchange in all countries, it seems to me that it would be advisable to invite the United States of America to co-operate in the measures which are suggested for dealing with this situation. Since the United States is not a Member of the League of Nations, action by the League of Nations, without reference to the United States, might be inoperative.* *Articles 14-19 were adopted. ** *The PRESIDENT - speaking in Italian:All the resolutions proposed by the Financial Commis-sion are approved.The Assembly will now pass to the general discussion of the Report of the Transport Commission, and I call upon the Reporter for that Commission.M. JASPAR (Belgium) - speaking in French: Gentlemen,The text of the Report which the Transport Commis-sion has the honour to submit for your approval is before you.You will see that this Report is in two parts:a) the text of the draft resolutions, in 8 articles ;b) the text of the reservations formulated by various delegations.As the President of the Commission, M. Theunis, who has been temporarily recalled to Brussels by pressing du-ties, has already said in his inaugural speech, the Transport Commission based its work on the study of Articles 58 to 61 of the London Experts&apos; Report.The substance of these four Articles is to be found in the Draft Resolutions which are before you. These show that almost all the Powers represented at Genoa have agreed to recognise in this way the foresight of the Lon-don Experts, and the equitable spirit shown by them in elaborating their Report.The Transport Commission studied at Genoa the re-storation and amelioration of international traffic by rail and water.This was a heavy task; but it was greatly facilitated, thanks to the useful work accomplished by the League of Nations in 1921, at Barcelona, and thanks also to the excellent work done at Porto-Rose in November, 1921. 1 must ack-nowledge also the work of the Experts who were preseri at Barcelona and Porto-Rose, and were so kind as t lend their knowledge for the purposes of the work whic Genoa has accomplished largely owing to them.These two Conferences have practically made a the rough inventory of the difficulties in transport matters whi have, since the end of the war, been the sad lot of great number of the Powers. These two Conferences hav formulated, edited, and approved Conventions and Resolt tions, all recommendations tending to minimise these di culties, whilst solving in the general interest numerous tec. nical problems.At its opening session, the Genoa Conference creat the Transport Commission. This Commission could not i better than submit these judicious texts to a new examr tion, and ask the Powers represented at Genoa to w extent they were satisfied, or what were the amenduien which they desired to introduce into these textsThe suggestion which the President made for the i rection of our labours in this manner was generally apprt ved. We set to work then on these lines.To-day, Gentlemen, we lay before you a Draft R lution generally adopted by the Transport Commission, \vh&apos; will, we hope, meet with your approval. You will, I am sin listen attentively to the text of the reservations which eti tain Powers have formulated in respect of certain Articl of this Draft Resolution. Indeed, these reservations claritj the situation. They also have the great merit of freeds of speech. Taken together, they constitute a focussing -which is as necessary as it is useful   of all that lia been done, and also of wh it remains to be done in important domain of international transport.As to what remains to be done, there is no doubt It the remaining work will be accomplished in that wide $&apos; rit of solidarity which has been manifested in the course our debates. France will be good enough to convene H technical conference foreshadowed in Article 6 of our R solutions, which is destined to bring these Articles i fruition. I have no doubt that this Conference will be : spired with the same principles and with the same spirit the principles and spirit with which Genoa has been inspire and I wish that Conference every success. It will be helpedl the League of Nations, which will aid us in finishing i work upon which we have started here.We thank the League sincerely for the help which it about to give us.I must also thank the Financial Commission for support which some of its most distinguished members hai given to the Transport Section, in order to clear up&quot; difficult question of the exchanges, which is such a distun ing influence on the fixation of net prices in one of the essential elements, that is to say the price of Iranspa and which is thus a hindrance to export trade, which is * of the most important factors in the development of qu( tions such as the economic peace of the world.Before concluding, I cannot refrain from thanking, i&quot; name of the Belgian Government, the Genoa Conference the great honour which it has done to my country in ask&apos; the Head of its Delegation to preside over one of the w important Commissions of the Conference.
The PRESIDENT - speaking in Italian:A general debate on the motions of the Transport Commission is now opened.I call upon M. Barrere, Delegate of France, to speak.M. BARRERE (France) - speaking in French: Gentlemen,I beg to support the conclusions and the Report sub-initted by M. Jaspar. I only wish to add that the French Delegation fully adheres to the text of the Report without any reservation, except that which is indicated in the Report itself.The PRESIDENT - speaking in Italian:As there are no other speakers down for the general debate, the debate is now closed, and the meeting will proceed to pass the several articles contained in the propo-sals of the Transport Commission. Perhaps it would be advisable, in the case of the Transport Commission^ Report, to pursue a different method from that which was followed in the case of the Report of the Finance Commission. As the Articles in the Report of the Transport Commission are closely connected, perhaps it is best that we should consider them all together. Therefore, if any speaker wishes to make any remarks on any special point in those articles, lie should ask leave to address the meeting. If no one asks to speak on any special point contained in the articles, then the whole of the Articles will be considered as approvedI now call upon Sir Philip Lloyd-Greame, Delegate of the British Empire,* to speak.Sir Philip LLOYD-GREAME (British Empire) - speaking in English:I think the Conference will agree that&quot;! the ^Transport Commission has discharged its work in a comprehensive and practical manner. The fact that the whole field has been covered in so short a time was only possible because the delegates and their associates recogni.ed alike the impor-tance of the problem and the interdependence of their tran-sport systems; and because they all brought to their task determination to co-operate in a common endeavour. Anyone who studies these recommendations will see that they are of a thoroughly practical character.Facilities for free transit by sea and land; reciprocal use and exchange of rolling stock; the re-establishment of direct international trains for passengers and goods; the oper-tion of inclusive tariffs; the use of a single waybill for borough transport; the prevention of Customs delays, in so ar as they depend upon these arrangements; the provisionof common frontier stations; all these are questions of an essentially practical character, all of them questions which might cause interminable delay if approached in a narrow spirit, but susceptible of common agreement and common treatment, once they are tackled, as they have been here, in a spirit of mutual co-operation.Not only has the Commission approached them in that spirit, but it has made sure that the Resolutions which it has passed will be carried into effect, firstly by the meeting of the General Managers in Paris, and secondly by the task which has been allotted to the League of Na-tions of watching the progress which is made.I think this is a genuine attempt, commensurate with the importance of the project. If the principles which have been recommended by the Commission are carried out, (as I am convinced they will be, in view of the virtual unanimity with which they have been accepted), we shall be well on the way to restore the transport systems of Europe; we shall have taken a great step towards providing the essential complement of the work which the Economic Commission is doing in another sphere, and the practice of these precepts will afford the surest guarantee for the credit and finance which the Finance Commission has fore-shadowed in its report.The PRESIDENT - speaking in Italian:I call upon M. Peano, Delegate of Italy, to speak.M. PEANO (Italy) - speaking in French:With regard to Article 2, the Italian Government wishes to state that it is taking immediate steps to ratify the Barcelona Convention.The PRESIDENT - speaking in Italian:As there are no other speakers, the whole of the Articles contained in the report of the Transport Commission are considered as adopted.As the items on the Agenda are now exhausted, the sitting will adjourn. But before doing so, I wish to&apos;express my warm thanks to the Commissions which have worked so excellently in accomplishing their task, and \ to their Presidents who have presented the Reports&quot;in so admirable a way. In my opinion, the work accomplished by these Commissions offers the best proof that the work of this Conference will be productive of good results, and I feel sure that I am expressing the opinion of you all in tender-ing the best thanks of the meeting to the Commissions and to their Presidents.** *The meeting terminated al 12.30 p. m.
