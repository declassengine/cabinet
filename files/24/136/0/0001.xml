[This Document is the Property of His &quot;Britannic Majestys Government.1Printed for the Cabinet.   March 1922.SECRET.CP. 3901.CABINET.DEVELOPMENTS IN  FRENCH AIR FORCE.Memorandum by the Secretary oe State for Air.AT the request of my colleagues I circulate the following &quot; Notes of a Conference held at the Air Ministry on the 13th March, 1922,&quot; together with a tabular statement showing the new French air programme and the proposed organisation of the French Army Air Service. The information furnished by our Air Attache in Paris may be summarised as follows : 1. It is proposed to disband certain infantry and cavalry regiments to provide the personnel required for the increases in the air service contemplated in the new programme.2. New machines are being built to the orders of the French Government at the rate of 150 per month, whereas under our present programme we shall only build 23 new machines (apart from experimental machines) during 1922-1923.3. If this new programme is carried into effect, France will have an independent striking force of 140 squadrons, averaging 9 machines each, for purposes of bombing and fighting.I would also draw attention to the views expressed by the Army Commission, under the presidency of General de Castelnau, to the effect that the present adminis-tration of the French, air services is unsatisfactory and that the Air Force cannot play its proper part until it is made autonomous.*The &quot; Notes&quot; and accompanying table have already been circulated to the Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence appointed to enquire into the , continental air menace.F. E. G.Air Ministry, March 24, 1922.* &quot; Both the Army and the Navy have been given facilities for working out their problems. So far the Air Service has been unable to follow suit for the simple reason that the administration of aviation is split up between the Ministries of War, Marine, Colonies and Public Works. This is surely an extraordinary method of conducting business, and one which must entail serious inconvenience.   So much is generally recognised.....   The Air Service has proved its right to be considered, not as the fifth arm but as a thirdfighting service.....   It will never take its true place until it attains complete independence andautonomy.....   Just as Naval officers and ratings have a totally different status from Army officers andmen, so the Air Service personnel must have a status of their own.....&quot;Extracts from a precis of the speech made by Colonel Fahry when preventing to the Chamber, on behalf oj the-Arm// Commission, the amended Bill for the Recruiting of the Army and the Organisation of National Defence.[8120]
Notes of a Conference held at the Air Ministry on March 13, 1922.THE Deputy-Director of Operations and Intelligence, the Air Secretary to the Secretary of State and a representative from the Air Intelligence Directorate and Secretariat were present at a Conference summoned by the Chief of the Air Stall to hear a statement made by the Air Attache, Paris.2. The Air Attache, Paris, drew attention to the extraordinary strength of the French Air Force, for which no less than 150 machines per month were being built. He pointed out that, in the event of the Army Reorganisation Bill becoming law, certain infantry and cavalry regiments would be disbanded in order to provide the necessary personnel for the numerous new Air Regiments and Wings which were to be formed as from 1923. Under this Bill the present total of squadrons would be increased to 220 squadrons.3. The manner in which these squadrons are to be organised is very noteworthy, and the creation of two Air Divisions, which are essentially offensive units, should not be overlooked. Such an organisation is unlike that adopted in the late war, and would therefore seem to he indicative of an aggressive policy on the part of the French.4. Reference was also made, to the creation of a French Independent Air Force. Squadron Leader Sewell stated that Colonel Fabry, &quot;Rapporteur&quot; of the Army Reorganisation Bill, had recently pointed out in the Chamber of Deputies that the Army Commission (of which General de Castelnau is the President) had expressed dissatisfaction at the way in which the French Air Services were at present administered by numerous Ministries, and had declared that the Air Force could never play its proper part until it were made autonomous.5. The Chief of the Air Stall&apos; stated that it was very important that the above facts should be in possession of those responsible for the presentation of the Air Force case to the authorities concerned, particularly as the Debates on the Army and Navy Estimates were about to take place. Be added that the mere fact that France possessed such a formidable weapon was sufficiently important to merit the immediate attention of those concerned with national defence.The Conference then concluded.March 13, 1922.
