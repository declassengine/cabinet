Kyi   -   4^&quot;-4 1THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 S GOVERNMENT.CABINET.L.G.75.Report of Special Inquiry Into Expenditure of the Poplarn Guardians.memorandum by the Minister of Health.I append for the consideration of my colleagues a copy of the special report made to me upon the expenditure of the Guardians of the Parish of Poplar Borough, together with a copy of a letter which I propose to address to the Guardians.I propose further to publish the report, and in view of what ia contained In it, I have little doubt that public opinion will support any action which the Government may think proper to take.     It will be been that the Commissioner reaches the conclusion that by careful and proper administration a saving of at least  100,000 per annum could be effected on the present rate of expenditure of the Guardians equivalent to the proceeds of a rate of about 2/6 in the  .     Besides suggesting a number of directions in which administrative economies should be made by the Guardians, he states that, as a matter of settled practice, relief is being given by them in cases where there is no destitution and where they have consequently no legal power to spend the ratepayers&apos; money.These findings would afford me matter for serious concern if it was merely a question of exercising my general power of control over Poor Law administration.     But Poplar is one of the Boards of Guardians to which It has been for some time and is still necessary for me to advance State money byiway of loan in order to meet current expenditure on relief. It seems to me, therefore, incumbent on me to take such steps as are in my power to reform the administration in Poplar andthat/
Ministry of Healththat I should not approve further advances of public money until I have some assurance that the Guardians aro prepared to mend their ways.I therefore propose to insist on such assurance before approving further loans.     It may be that the Guardians will decline to give any assurance, in-which case it will be necessary to introduce the bill (for which I have already received provisional approval) empowering me to suspend the Board of Guaraians and appoint other persons to take over their functions.     The Bill would require to be passed through all Its stages in a minimum of time.     I recognise that the Bill might be opposed as an unwarranted interference with local government, and it is possible that some other Boards of Guardians who are In serious financial difficulty might cease to act and throw the burden on the Government.I earnestly hope that it will not be necessary to proceed to extremes, but In view of the possibility that the Poplar Guardians will refuse to accept my decision, I must warn my colleagues of the issues involved*A. MOND. 15/5/22.
Sir,I am directed by the Minister of Health to forward to you the accompanying copy of the Report made to him by the Special Commissioner appointed to inquire into the expenditure of the Guardians of the Parish of Poplar Borough, and in view of the Commissioner^ serious criticisms of the Guardians&apos; policy and administration I am to urge them to give the Report their immediate and most careful consideration.ixS the result of his inquiry the Commissioner finds that the administration of the Poor Law in Poplar is dictated by a policy which is in many Instances foreign to the spirit and intention of the Statutes, and that the principles which influence the Guardians in the excessive expenditure referred to in the Report are as byd as, If not worse than, those existing prior to the present Poor Law system.     In particular he points out that the lavish allowances of Outdoor relief encourage    persons to apply who would not otherwise do so, and that the Guardians&apos; policy has a tendency to demoralise the recipients and is calculated to destroy incentive to thrift, self-reliance and industry.In the letter which he addressed to the Minister on the 22nd ultimo, the Chairman of the Guardians contended that the Guardians, in granting relief according to their judgme ni, of the ne ce s s it ie s of the   var i ous cases, we re merely exercising a discretion which is vested in them by the Statutes.     It seems necessary, therefore, to point out quite clearly that, while the Guardians are entrusted with a discretion to determine what is needed to relieve destitution whore destitution does in fact exist, they are*
not empowered to make grants -out of &quot;moneys provided by the rates   in any case in which destitution is not present., and their action In granting relief in such cases ac   those mentioned by the Commissioner is therefore unlawful.The policy of the Guardians is fair neither to the ratepayers of the Parish nor to the independent workmen who are persevering to support themselves and their families by their own unaided labour.     The Commissioner considers that by careful administration the Guardians could effect a reduction In their present expenditure of at least  100,000 per annum, equivalent to the produce of a rate of 2/6d. in the  .     By adherence to the principles which have elsewhere been almost universally recognised as governing the administration of relief the Guardians could check the progressive demoralisation of the poor of tho Parish and could afford a much needed encouragement to those who have persisted in reliance upon their own thrift and industry.The Minister therefore earnestly trusts that the Guardians will at once proceed to set on foot the reforms which are indicated in the Commissioner^ Report and he looks to receive from them within a month from this date a statement of the action which they have taken or propose to take in this direction.     The Guardians must clearly under-stand that it will not be possible for the Minister to make further advances of public money unless they bring their policy and administration into conformity with the principles and procedure which are accepted by other Boards of Guardians throughout the country.I am, &amp;c.- 2 -

PARISH OF POPLAR BOROUGH.REPORTovSPECIAL inquiry into theEXPENDITURE OF THE GUARDIANS.To the Right Honourable Sir ALFRED MOND, Bart,, M.P., Minister of Health.Sir,In accordance with your instructions I have conducted a special inquiry into the expenditure of the Guardians of the Parish of Poplar Borough with a view to securing with-out delay such economies as are consistent with efficient administration.   &quot;My investigation commenced on the 13th March, 1922, and shortly after that date I had two interviews with the Secretary of the Municipal Alliance with the object of ascertaining whether the Alliance had any evidence to put before me if I commenced a Public Inquiry. At the second interview, at which the Chairman of the Municipal Alliance was also present, it was explained to me that in view of the difficulty of obtaining persons to give evidence owing to the disturbed conditions existing in the Parish at the time, they did not feel justified in proceeding with the application which they had made for such an Inquiry, and on the 12th April, 1922, the Secretary wrote me as follows in) reply to an inquiry I had addressed to him on the subject.POPLAR BOROUGH MUNICIPAL ALLIANCE.Central Offices and Committee Room, 52, Bow Road,London, E.3.12th April, 1922.Dear Mr. Cooper,In reply to your letter of the 6th instant, having given the subject matter the most careful consideration and in view of the difficulties with which we are confronted, we are of opinion that at the moment no&apos; real good would arise from a Public Inquiry.We shall, therefore, be content with the Report of the Investigations now pro-ceeding, reserving to ourselves the right at a later period, if thought necessary, to request that a Public Inquiry should be held.Faithfully yours,ALFRED WARREN,Secretary.H. I. Coopee, Esq.,Ministry of Health,Whitehall, S.W.I.Under the circumstances, it was decided that I should continue my investigations without holding a Public Inquiry.Owing to the large increase in the number of Outdoor poor the work of the Inquiry was necessarily impeded in consequence of the officials of the Guardians not always being available,, which resulted in delay in obtaining information on various matters, although there was willingness shown by the officers at all times to render assistance in the work of investigation.Some comparative tables in continuation of those appended to the report made by the late Sir J. S. Davy, C.B., in 1906 and other statistics, etc., are set out in the appendix to this report, viz. : Table &quot; A.&quot; Number of persons in receipt of Poor Law Relief &quot; Indoor &quot; and &apos;&apos; Outdoor &apos;&apos; on the 1st January and 1st July in each year from 1907 to (January) 1922.Table &quot; B.&quot; Number of persons in receipt of Poor Law Relief with the ratio per thousand of population.Table &quot; C &quot; : Expenditure on In-maintenance and Outdoor Relief from 1906 to 1921, in the Parish of Poplar Borough as compared with the whole of London.Table &quot; D &quot; : Number of persons in receipt of Poor Law Relief in the Parishes of Poplar Borough, Bethnal Green, Bermondsey, Limehouse and Whitechapel and in the West Ham Union.Table &quot; E &quot; : Statistics as to Rateable Value, outstanding loans, cost of Institu-tions, etc.37150a 2:

Although the out-relief commenced to appreciably increase in October and November, 1920, no attempt was made by the Guardians, even in a modified way, to put in force any labour test under the Relief Regulation Order, 1911 (which provides that in granting relief, other than Institutional Relief, to a male personi, that person should be set to work and kept employed by the Guardians), or to discriminate in the granting of relief between those of the unemployed who were deserving and those who were undeserving. In all cases relieved the Guardians grant the full amount according to their scale.Out-door relief expenditure M.C.P.F. Prior to the 1st October, 1921, expenditure incurred by Boards of Guardians in the Metropolis on Out-door relief was borne out of the rates of the Union or.Parish in which it was incurred but subsequent to that date, in accor-dance with the Local Authorities (Financial Provisions) Act, 1921, and the Metropolitan Common Poor Fund (Out-door Relief) Regulations, 1922, dated 4th January, 1922, made in pursuance of that Act, Boards of Guardians were permitted to charge then: Out-door Relief Expenditure upon the Metropolitan Common Poor Fund, subject to those regulations, to the following extent: (a) From the 1st October, 1921, to the end of the week in which the 1st Februaryoccurs, at the rate of a sum not exceeding the amount actually expended, or lOd. in respect of each person in receipt of Out-door Relief for each day he received such Out-door Relief whichever is the less.(b) Subsequent to the week which includes the 1st February, 1922 the repayment fromthe Fund is limited to the scale and conditions set out in the Schedule to the Regulations.(The Metropolitan Common Poor Fund was established under the Metropolitan Poor Act, 1867, as amended by the Metropolitan Poor Amendment Act, 1869, and the Metropolitan Poor Amendment Act, 1870, and in pursuance of those statutes certain expenditure for maintenance of lunatics, medicines and surgical appliances supplied to Out-door poor, salaries of officers so far as sanctioned by the Ministry of Health, Fees for registration of Births and Deaths, Vaccination Fees, Maintenance of children in certain schools, poor people over 16 years of age in Workhouses and rations of officers are chargeable to the Fund and table &quot; F &quot; : Statement showing the population, inhabited houses, etc. Census Returns 1901, 1911 and 1921.Table &quot; G &quot; : Statement relating to persons chargeable to the Parish of Poplar Borough on the 1st April, 1922; Rateable Value and Net Expenditure.Chart showing the number per thousand of the estimated population of persons in receipt of domiciliary relief in the Parish of Poplar Borough and the Metropolis on the 1st January, in the years 1913 to 1922.OUTDOOR RELIEF.Numbers of Persons relieved. Trade generally declined rapidly in the six months from June to December, 1920, and relief to Unemployed persons had actually commenced in April, 1920. It appears from the returns which were produced to me that there was a marked increase in the number of Able-bodied poor in January, 1921, and that there was a continuous rise up to November, 1921, when there was a temporary decrease, followed by a still greater rise up to the 22nd April, last, on which date the total number of persons relieved increased to 29,329, including 6,527 separate families of Able-bodied persons. The following are the numbers of persons relieved and of the cost of such relief in the last week of each month commencing on the 30th October, 1920, up to and including the 22nd April, 1922.
contributions to the fund are paid by the Metropolitan Unions and Parishes pro rota to the Rateable Value of such Unions and Parishes.)Scales of relief and deductions in respect of income (Unemployed). The Scale of Relief prescribed by the Regulations above referred to, and the scales of relief adopted by the guardians of the Parish of Poplar Borough are given in the appendix (see pages-).A comparison of the scale of the Poplar Guardians for Able-bodied Unemployed persons with that set out in the Metropolitan Common Poor Fund (Outdoor Relief) Regulations, 1922, is set out below : Lone person Man and Wife		Popl	ir*	Ministry of			Scale, t		Health Scale			  s.	d	  s.	d.		1   5	6	18	0	......	1 13	0	1   8	and One Child		1 19	6	1 14	0,,&apos; 2 Children		2   4	6	1 19	0CO		2   9	6	2   4	0	J,                        ...	2 14	6	2   8	0,,   5	ti                             &apos; &apos; &apos;	2 19	6	2 12	06	j;                             * * *	3   4	6	2 14	0,,   7	...	3  9	6	2 14	000	,,                             ...	3 14	6	2 14	09	...	3 19	6	2 14	0io	,,                             ...	4   4	6	2 14	0It will be observed that the Poplar Guardians&apos; Scale in respect of small families does not vary to any great extent from that of the Ministry, but in the cases of the larger families there is a marked difference between the scales.In applying the scale in respect of families comprising more than seven persons, the Guardians have not adopted the view generally held that the amount of relief under the Poor Law should, of necessity, be calculated on a lower scale than the earnings of an independent workman who maintains himself by his labour. This view is supported in the schedule to the regulations above referred to in which it is stated : &quot; That Out-door Relief shall not in any case be charged upon the Metropolitan Common Poor Fund in excess of a sum which will raise the weekly income of the applicant, or of the household of which he is the head or a member, to a sum less by 105. a week than the standard rate of wages for the time being recommended for work-people of Grade &quot; A &quot; under the Agreement of the London District Industrial Council for non-trading Services (Manual Labour).&quot;The Standard Rate at present is  3 4s. Od. per week and therefore the maximum amount of relief which can be recovered from the Metropolitan Common Poor Fund in any particular case is  2 14s. Od. per week under the regulations appertaining to the Metropolitan Common Poor Fund, however, it is provided that for the purposes of calculating relief, the income or means from every source received by, or available to the applicant, or by or to any other member of the household, shall be taken into account, save in so far as may be provided to the contrary by any statute, less reasonable expenses for the purpose of earning any income, but the Poplar Guardians7 Scale provides that athough the whole of parents&apos; earnings are to be deducted in ascertaining the amount of relief to be granted, only a small portion of children&apos;s earnings when such earnings exceed 15s. per week is calculated as income of the family, and children&apos;s earnings up to 15s. per week are ignored. In pursuance of this policy the Guardians are, in numerous instances, granting relief in cases in which there appears to be no destitution, the total income of the household apart from the relief granted exceeding  3 4s. Od. per week. .A few typical cases are set out below : &apos;Man (Unemployed) and wife, no dependent children/ adult single daughters each earning 30s. per week Relief       ..................  s. d.6 1Total for family of six persons      7   5   0Man (Unemployed) and wife one dependent child.Five adult single children earning Man draws Unemplovment Benefit ...

months ended 31st March, 1922, 13,245 pairs of boots were so granted, at cost of  8,193. Clothing and bedding to the value of  529 5s. 2d. were also distributed to the Out-door poor during the same period.The Boots are given out by the Clothing Distributor and are stamped P.B.G. with the date of issue. The other clothing (suits, dresses, underclothing, etc.) is given out by the Master of the Poplar Institution from his stocks; if the articles are not in stock he generally purchases new or second-hand clothing from different tradespeople in Poplar, without con-tracts. The clothing is not marked and could be pawned or sold without chance of detec-tion. In April last a pair of boots issued to a man were offered in pawn, but being stamped P.B.G. the Pawnbroker notified the Clerk to the Guardians and the boots were recovered and returned to the Guardians.   The clothing should certainly be marked.It appears from the record of the cost of boots, clothing, etc., granted in the several relief districts that certain Relief Committees are much more generous than others in granting boots, clothing, etc., to outdoor relief recipients. During the half-year ended 31st March, 1922, boots, clothing, etc., to the value of  100 Is. Od. were issued in the No. 2 Relief District, and in the same period boots, clothing,&apos;etc., to the value of  325 6s. Id. were issued in the No. 12 District, although each District dealt with approximately the same number of relief cases in the half-year. The average cost of boots, clothing, etc., issued per Relief District during the period was  213 0s. 0d.Unemployment Insurance Benefits. In a number of cases, owing to the inability of the Labour Exchanges to pay Unemployment Benefits promptly, relief has been granted to the full extent of the Scale. When the recipient has received the unemployment Insurance Arrears, and the fact has become known to the Guardians, relief has been either suspended or substan-tially reduced. In a number of other cases however, it has been found that Out-relief recipients have expended the amount of arrears received from the Labour Exchanges and in these cases this fact appears to have been ignored by the Guardians if the money has, in their opinion, been properly expended. By ignoring this fact the Guardians are, in effect, allowing their roiief to be augmented and no action has been taken to deter others from expending arrears of Unemployment Benefit when received.Prosecutions. During the year ended 31st March, 1921, proceedings were taken by the Guardians in 53 cases in respect of neglect of family, maintenance of relatives, etc. During the period 1st April to 16th October, 1921, proceedings were taken in 59 cases, but since October, 1921, when certain members of the Board were liberated from prison, the Guardians have not instituted.any proceedings, although a substantial number of such cases have been reported to them since that month.   A few typical cases are set out below : A man received arrears of Army pay amounting to  27 12s. 2d. whilst in receipt of relief without disclosing this information to the Guardians The Guardians decided that the man be cautioned.A man whilst receiving Out-door relief of 32s. 6d. per week, was working as a Night Watchman for the Poplar Borough Council at wages of 35s. lOd. weekly, and did not give this information to the Guardians.   The Guardians neither cautioned nor prosecuted the man..Man and wife and three dependent children. Whilst in receipt of relief amounting to 52s. Od. per week the man failed to disclose that he was in receipt of a pension of 13s. lid. per week and that his wife had been acting as a Money Lender, loaning small sums of money totalling about  4 per week to people in the neighbourhood. The Guardians ordered the man &quot; to return the relief granted at the rate of 10s. Od. per week or be prosecuted.&quot; The man did not comply with this order and in December, 1921, the Guardians cancelled the Order but did not prosecute the man.Widow with three dependent children, who had been in receipt of relief (latterly at the rate of 28s. 6d. per week) since 1913. Pound to have been regularly employed as Charwoman by the Port of London Authority: for 6$ years, earning 24s. 2d., weekly without revealing the information to the Guardians.   The Guardians decided to censure the woman.The wife of a man receiving relief had been working and this fact had been concealed from the Guardians. The woman had been working for about six months as a school cleaner, earning 26s. Od. per week. The relief granted during the period had varied according to the income of the family from 44s. 6d. to 17s. 6d. per week. The Guardians decided to caution the man.Woman with one dependent child receiving relief and living apart from her husband. On the 22nd April, 1921, the man was ordered by the Magistrates to pay 7s. 6d. per week towards the maintenance of the child. No payment was made by the man under this order. The Magistrates then made an &quot; arrears &quot; order &quot; for  4 8s. 6d. and this order was also ignored, and this was reported to the Guardians. They decided &quot; that the matter be discharged and the orders cancelled.&quot;The wife of a man in receipt of relief had been working and this fact had not been reported to the Guardians. The woman had been working for about six weeks and earning 37s. 6d. per week. Relief of 27s. 6d. per week had been granted during the period. The Guardians ordered the man to repay the relief received at the rate of 3s. Od. per week. After the man had repaid 6s. Od. only, the Guardians cancelled the order to repay.The wife of a man in receipt of relief had been working and this fact had not been reported to the Guardians. The woman had been working for two years and earning 23s. 9d. per week Relief of 51s. 6d. per week had been granted during the whole of the period. The Guardians decided that the man be cautioned.
sA man ordered by the Magistrates to pay 12s. Od. per week towards the maintenance of his. four children chargeable to the Guardians. The man, who has one child at home, earns  4 7s. od. per week. In January, 1922, arrears of  5 2s. Od. had accrued under the order, and  20 19s. Od. had been previously Written off in this case as irrecoverable arrears under a Guardians Order. A proposal at a meeting of the Guardians that further proceedings be taken in this case was not adopted.Woman in receipt of out-door relief. A married son with no family earning  3 17s. Od. per week was ordered by the Guardians to pay 2s. 6d. per week towards the relief granted, and&apos; in January, 1922, arrears of 32s. 6d. had accrued on this order. The son was twice asked to attend the meeting of the Guardians, but neither did so nor sent any message. The Guardians decided to cancel the arrears, and although the man has not paid anything since January, a Magistrates&apos; Order has not been applied for.I have ascertained from the Relieving Officers in the above cases that the persons referred to who did not disclose their total incomes whilst in receipt of relief had many opportunities of&apos; doing so.Single men and women.-There are many cases on the Guardians&apos; Books of boys and girls as young as sixteen years, living with their parents being granted relief of 10s. od. per week, although the total income of the household exceeds  2 14s. Od. per week. The total number of single men and women living with parent or parents receiving relief on their own account on the 28th April, 1922, was 985.Widows with children. An exatoiination of the scale of relief to widows and children shows that only one-half of any earnings of the woman are deducted from the amount due^ under the scale.   A few examples are set out below : widow three dependent children:	 	s.	d.Widow earns	1	11	10^ Relief       ...    .... -   ...      ......      ......	1	3	0Total for family of four persons	2	14	10widow five dependent children:			Widow earns	1	16	0Relitef       .........      ...      ...      ...      ...	1	10	0Total for a. family of six persons	3	6	0	 	s.	d.widow 1 dependent child:			Widow earns       ...      ...      ...	0	12	0One Daughter earns	1	4	0Relief	0	19	0Total for family of three persons	2	15	0Coal allowance. On the 4th January, 1922, the General Purposes Committee of the Poplar Guardians found that the price of Coal ruling at that date was 2s. 6d. per cwt., and reduced the coal allowance in relief cases accordingly from 3s. Od to 2s. 6d. per week. At the following meeting of the Committee several hundreds of unemployed attended with reference to the decision, resulting in the coal allowance of 3s. Od. being reinstated, notwithstanding that the regulations of the Ministry provide that fuel up to 1 cwt., per week in winter, or its equivalent in money, not exceeding 3s. Od. per week, may be granted, (the equivalent in money at this date was 2s. 6d.).Children of out-door relief recipients. Summer hoiday. Extra Christmas relief. In July and August, 1921, the Guardians sent about 140 children of persons in receipt of Out-door relief from their homes in Poplar to the Guaridans&apos; Schools at Shenfield for a fortnight&apos;s. holiday. In addition to the cost of their maintenance the Guardians expended a sum of  18 in conveying the children to and from Poplar. The children sent were nominated by the district Medical Officers who had been requested by the Guardians to select those children who were, in their opinion, in need of a holiday. The out-door relief granted to the parents of these children was not reduced in consequence of the absence of the children. The parents were permitted to continue to receive the full amount of relief to enable them to purchase any clothing which the children might require for the holiday The sending away of children of out-door relief recipients for a summer holiday at the expense of the rates is, I think, a new departure in the Poor Law. I have little doubt that there are in the Poplar District many children, whose parents are not in receipt of relief, who cannot afford to send then children away for a holiday, and I think that the ratepayers should not be called upon to pay this expenditure in respect of out-door relief children. The extra Christmas allowances to persons in receipt of outdoor relief for Christmas, 1920, were fixed by the Guardians at 3s. for each adult and 2s. each child, this allowance did not apply to unemployed workpeople and their children. Like allowances were decided upon by the Guardians for Christmas, 1921, but on the 14th December, 1921, the representatives of the unemployment^ed attended a meeting of the Guardians and demanded double Christmas relief; the Guardians thereupon
deciided, as a compromise, to increase the Christmas allowance to 5s. for each adult, and 2s. for each child, such allowance to apply also to unemployed workpeople and their children in addition. This was done, notwithstanding that the cost of living had decreased from 169 per cent, in December, 1920, to 99 per cent, in December, 1921. 1 am informed that the additional cost of this allowance amounted to  3,000.Relief to Woman and two Children legally removable to another Union. Another instance of an unnecessary charge on the Ratepayers of Poplar in) expenditure in relief is to be found in the case of a certain woman who, with her child, aged about two years, applied fon a.nd was granted relief, in consequence of desertion by her husband, in February, 1920, having had a residence in Poplar for a period of only two days. She was legally settled! in and removable to West Ham Union and a Justices Order for removal was obtained on the 21st April, 1920. A second child was born onj the 4th September, 1920. It is recorded that there had been continuous relief given by the Poplar Guardians since the Order of removal up to the 23rd April, 1921. On that date the Guardians applied to the West Ham Guardians to accept the chargeability and allow the children to remain in Poplar Institution at the expense of the West hankey Guardians. The West Ham Guardians refused to do this. On the 15th April, 1921, the woman was employed as Matron&apos;s maid at Poplar Institution at  62 10s, 0d. per year with board lodging and washing, and a Justices&apos; Order was obtained for the removal of her two children to the West Ham Union on the 22nd June, 1921. On the 8th July, 1921, the Guardians ordered that the woman contribute 5s. Qd. per week towards the cost of the children&apos;s maintenance and decided not to remove the children to West Ham and the children were maintained at the schools of the Poplar Guardians until April, 1922. Thus, for upwards of two years, the Ratepayers of Poplar were charged with this maintainance when there was no apparent reason that they should not have been removed to the West Ham Union, and the mother out of her income of  62 10s. Od. with board, lodging, etc., was only called upon to contribute at the rate of 5s. Od. per week.Proposed Increase in Relief Scale, after receiving Deputation from Unemployed-The minutes of the meeting of the Guardians, held on the 31st January, 1922, include reference to a. letter in which the Guardians informed the Ministry that a large number of unemployed men together with a big demonstration of women attended their meeting and that after hearing Delegates of the men and women, the Board discussed the matter and finally resolved to adopt the following scale of relief:  Able-bodied.(a) Man and wife ...Each child     ......      ............Rent up toOne cwt. coal, or equal in gas.(b) Single persons (18 years of age and over)......One cwt. coal, or equal in gas.(c) Single persons (between the ages of 16 and 18years)        .................. 15   0No deduction to be made from this Scale except the earnings of the applicant or other persons of the household receiving relief, together with the full allowances from the Labour Exchange. Old Age Pensioners.That the scale of relief for Old Age Pensioners be 10s, Ocl.  weekly in addition to the pension. Widows and Deserted Women.30s. Od. weekly (including rent). 6s. Od. weekly each, child. .       1 cwt. coal, or equal in gas. &apos;Deductions as in foregoing scale.The scales are to be operative as from the 6th proximo.To this letter, the following reply was submitted : To the Chairman of the Poplar 31st January, 1922.Board of Guardians.Sir,I am directed by the Minister of Health to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 30th instant, reporting the scale upon which the Guardians of the Parish of Poplar Borough propose to grant relief to able-bodied applicants.The Minister understands that this scale is in excess even of the revised scale submitted at the Guardians&apos; meeting by the deputations to which you refer. It is in excess of any scale in force either in the Metropolis or in the Provinces, and it appears to be admitted by the Guardians that it is inl excess of what is required for the relief of destitution.Inasmuch as the legal powers anfd duties of the Guardians are limited to the relief of destitution, the grant of allowances in accordance with the scale proposed will be unlawful.I am, Sir,Your obedient Servant,H. W. S. FRANCIS,Assistant Secretary.37150 B 	s.	d.2	0	0	6	0	15	01&apos;	10	0
At this meeting it was reported by the Clerk that the scale adopted would increase the weekly sum expended on Out-relief from  8,000 to.  12,000 per week. It was thereupon decided by 12 votes to 1.&quot; That the Relieving Officers be instructed that the scale above referred to shall not be put into force as from the 6th February, but that until the Board has come to a decision on the matter, the scale of relief as at present administered is to continue in force.&quot;The following letter was addressed to the Guardians by Messrs. George Armstrong &amp; Co., Ltd., Cumberland Mills, Isle of Dogs, London, E.14, on the 30th January, 1922 : &quot; Dear Sir,Our employees who live in Poplar have pointed out to us that they can get more money by being unemployed than working for us, and as we have no wish to prevent them from getting as much as possible, we propose to dismiss them so that they can take advantage of your relief.Yours faithfully,(Signed)     GEORGE ARMSTRONG &amp; Co., Ltd., &apos;  per EDWARD COOPER, Director.&quot;This letter, I am informed, was read to the General Purposes Committee on) the 1st February, but does not appear to have been included in the Report of that Committee to the Meeting of the Guardians held on the 22nd February, 1922.The increased scale of relief was subsequently abandoned.Further deputation from unemployed. On the 22nd March, 1922, a deputation representing the Poplar, Bow and Bromley unemployed organisation attended before the Guardians and put forward the following request for their consideration : 1. The granting of the National Scale of Relief as laid down by the ManchesterConference of the Unemployed Organisation. 2. The continuance of the allowance of 3s. Od. weekly in lieu of coal. 3. The appointment of a barber for attending the unemployed in the Parish free otcharge.4. The issue of Underwear and Wearing Apparel, including Boots, in cases of necessity. 5. The granting of bedding in all cases of necessity.This request was referred to the General Purposes&apos; Committee, and on the 15th March, 1922, the Committee decided not to take any action thereon, but it should be noted that the issue of underwear, wearing apparel and boots and bedding were, and still are, being issued by the Guardians in many instances. The cost of clothing (other than boots) and bedding for the year ending 31st March, 1922, as previously stated, araounted to  529 5s. 2d.Cost of relief in excess of amount which can be recovered from Metropolitan Common Poor Fund. The statements required - by the Metropolitan Common Poor Fund (Outdoor Relief) Regulations, 1922, to be made in claiming repayment from the Fund by any Union or Parish showing (a) the number of cases relieved by the Guardians in each week of the half-year,(b) the amount actually expended in respect of such cases, and(c) the amount chargeable upon&apos; the Fund under the Regulations have not been completed for the half-year ended 31st March, 1922, so as to enable a comparison between one Union or Parish in the Metropolis and another, but it is estimated by the Clerk that in the Parish of Poplar the figures will be as follows : Total Relief............    229,060Of which will be.chargeable on theMetropolitan   Common   PoorFund    ...      .........    182,510And on the Rates of Poplar ...      46,550     or 20&apos;3 per cent., equal to a rateof about Is. Id. in the   for the half-year.When the whole of the statements referred to in this paragraph are received from the various Unions and Parishes in the Metropolis for the half-year ended 31st March, 1922, a comparison of. the items under the headings (a), (b) and (c) above mentioned would give useful information in regard to the expenditure in Out-Relief in excess of the scale prescribed by the Regulations of the Ministry in any particular Unions or Parishes.A calculation made in relation to six out of the 12 Relief Districts of another Metropolitan Parish (1) shows the following figures : Total expenditure in respect of the six Districts ...  14,748 Of which will be chargeable to the MetropolitanCommon Poor Fund............  13,164And on the Rates of the Parish  ...      ......  1,584, or 10&apos;7 per cent.
Statistics. The chart in theAppendix (page ) shows at a glance the rapid rise in the numbers of persons per thousand of the estimated population in receipt of domiciliary or out-door relief in the Parish of Poplar Borough as compared with the whole of the Metropolis, Poplar&apos;s increase being from 15 per thousand in January, 1919, to 133 in January, 1922, while the Metropolis increased in the same period from 5 to 38 per thousand. A comparison of the mean number of persons in receipt of Outdoor Relief 1st July, 1921, and 1st January, 1922  with that of the neighbouring Parishes and Union shows that the number per 1,000 of popula-tion for Poplar is double that of the adjoining Parishes of Limehouse, Bethnal Green and the Union of West Ham, nearly double that of Bermoudsey, and out of all comparison with that of Whitechapel (see Table &quot; D &quot; in the Appendix).Statistics showing the comparative cost of Outdoor Relief per case or per person in the Parish of Poplar Borough and in the other London Unions would not be of any value inasmuch as the Poplar Guardians grant relief in many cases in which relief in similar cases would not be given by other London Unions. In the majority of these cases the amounts of relief granted are comparatively small, and therefore they reduce the average per case or per person in Poplar.(1)   CAMBERWELL.INDOOR RELIEF.(1)   POPLAR INSTITUTION.Accommodation, Number of Inmates, Cost, etc. This Institution has accommodation for 1,346 inmates. The number of inmates chargeable on 31st March, 1922, was 804, and such inmates were classified as follows : 	Men.                     Women.				Children.                   Total.				Accommc-dation.

The Institution is heated by open fires and gas radiators; with the exception of the Dining Hall and Chapel, there is no steam heating. The coal used in the open fires in the different parts of the Institution is not rationed but can be obtained as required.The engineering plant comprises three dynamos, each 50 h.p. 100 voltage, worked by-three steam-driven engines, two Lancashire boilers, laundry machinery and one vertical boiler (used occasionally), and the engineering staff employed is as follows : Office. Salary. Hours of Duty.Chief Engineer      ...       375 per annum      ...       9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Asst. ...       300        ,, ...       7.30 a.m. to 5 p.m.Engineer     ...      ...      90s. 3d. weekly       ...      7 a.m. to 3 p.m.,, ...      .... ,, ...      3 p.m. to 11 p.m.,, ...      .. ,, ...      11 p.m. to 7 a.ra.Relief Engineer     .... ...

The Guardians generate their own electricity at the Institution although the Borough Council supply electricity throughout the area. The consumption of electricity during the year ended 31st March, 1922, was :-Lighting 44,417 units, and power 28,199 units.The engineering staff appears to be excessive, and I would suggest that expert advice be obtained as to whether it would not be more economical if the Guardians obtained the electricity required from the Borough Council.Inmates&apos; Dietary. The following dietary of the inmates (excluding the sick) is, I consider, liberal : Breakfast, served at 730 a.m., consisting of : Men and women, all classes I pint tea or coffee, 3 oz. bread, J oz. butter,   pint porridge, \ pint milk. Lunch, served at 10 a.m., consisting of : Half pint of milk to men and women of A classes : this refers to patients in the Male and Female Infirm Wards, also bread and cheese is served to a few others, i.e., coalmen, kitchen helpers and laundry women. Dinner, served at 12 noon, in accordance with the following table : Men. Women.Sunday       ...     3 ozs. meat, 12 ozs. potatoes, etc., 4 3 ozs. meat, 8 ozs potatoes, etc., 4ozs. dried fruit puddings. ozs. dried fruit pudding.Monday       ...     3 ozs. meat, 12 ozs. potatoes, etc., 8 3 ozs. meat, 8 ozs. potatoes, etc., 8ozs. rice pudding. oz-&quot;. rice pudding.Tuesday      ...   14 ozs. meat pudding, 8 ozs. rice 12 oz^. meat pudding, 8  ozs. ricepudding. pudding.Wednesday ...     6 ozs. bread, 3 ozs. cheese, 1 pint 5 ozs. bread, 2 ozs. cheese, 1 pintcoffee,  -oz. butter, 2 ozs. onions coffee  -oz. butter, 2 ozs. onionsor lettuce. or lettuce.Thursday    ...     3 ozs. meat, 12 ozs. potatoes, etc., 3 3 ozs. meat, 8 ozs. potatoes, etc., 3ozs. bread. ozs. bread.Friday        ...     8 ozs. fish, 12 &quot;ozs. potatoes, etc., 4 8 ozs. fish, 8 ozs. potatoes, etc., 4ozs. treacle pudding. ozs. treacle pudding.Saturday     ...   14 ozs. meat pie, 8 ozs. rice pudding 12 ozs. meat pie, 8 ozs. rice puddingTea, served at 5.30 p.m., consisting of : Six to eight ounces of bread, one pint of tea, half ountee of butter, andSunday and Monday ...

Cookeu. bacon, 3 ozs.In addition half pint of tea is issued to each inmate at 2 p.m.Until recently the inmates were supplied with supper at 8.30 p.in., but this meal has been discontinued and more substantial tea meal has been substituted.Although this change has involved additional expenditure, I was informed that owing to the fact that a large number of the inmates did not return to the institution1 from daily leave until 9 p.m. in the summer months, the provision of supper caused considerable waste. The Guardians decided to substitute butter for margarine ini the dietary of the inmates of the institution in October, 1921, at an additional cost of about  600 per annum.Daily Leave of Inmates. The inmates are allowed to be absent from the Institution after-breakfast until 9 p.m. daily, with the exception of those inmates who are given work to do. The latter are permitted to leave the establishment when they have finished their work. All the inmates who go out are allowed to return to the Institution for their meals if they so desire, and I am informed that practically the whole of them do so. The Institution is regarded more as an almshouse than a workhouse.Employment of Inmates. The inmates who are able to work are employed in serving meals, making beds, laundry work, window cleaning on the ground floor and as messengers, but the amount of work required from them is slight. The Guardians do not permit inmates of the Institution to be given any work in the Institution in their own trades.Eighteen paid scrubbers are employed at the Institution!, but I am informed that if the Guardians reduced this number by six the work they are doing could be undertaken by inmates. The Guardians, I understand, take the view that if they dispense with the services of these scrubbers they would apply for Outdoor Relief. If this did happen it is doubtful whether the relief would amount to as much asl the wages ( 2 Is. per week each) the women are receiving, and the women would, if placed on the Outdoor Relief List, have more time to attend to their children and their homes.Purchase of Newspapers, etc., for Inmates. The Guardians purchase, for the use of theinmates of the Poplar Institution, 78 daily newspapers, 78 Sunday newspapers, 93 weekly periodicals and 36 monthly magazines, at an approximate annual cost of  220. These quantities have been purchased since 1908, when there were 1,580 inmates in the Institution, and although the number of inmates had decreased to less than 800 when the attention of the Guardians was recently drawn to this expenditure, they decided not to take any action.

One hundred and sixty-four persons (including teachers) are employed on the staff at the Schools, representing an) average of one Officer for every four children. I think this staff could be considerably reduced.The employees, including the domestic staff, are engaged 48 hours weekly.Dietary. The Guardians decided in June, 1921, to substitute butter for margarine in the Children&apos;s Dietary at an&apos; estimated additional annual cost of  500. I understand this decision was arrived at after the Medical Officer had reported to the Guardians the result of a periodical weighing of the children.Band. From an examination of the accounts passed for payment, I learned that on three occasions in September, 1921, when certain members of the Board were in the Brixton Prison, the Band from the Schools was sent to play outside the Prison. The expense of sending the children from the Schools for this purpose amounted to  10 8s. lid.   A sum of  3 12s. 8d. was:also expended in sending the Band to play at a meeting in Poplar on the 5th September, 1921, but I have been unable to ascertain the purpose for which the meeting was held.     These-expenses were charged in the accounts of the Superintendents of the Schools on the 29th October, 1921. The Clerk to the Guardians pointed out to the members that there was no legal authority for the payment of the above expenses of the Band, but, after discussion, the Guardians decided that the expenses be charged in the Guardians&apos; accounts.New playground for children. In August, 1921, the Guardians decided to have about 2f acres of land on the estate levelled and drained for use as a playground for the children. Most of the 32 men employed daily on this work had previously been in receipt of Outdoor Relief in Poplar, and were men with large families, but were not skilled.in work of this kind. The men were paid  4 Is. 6d. per week,&quot;and were supplied by the Guardians with Boots for the work.   Tea in the mornings and afternoons was also provided.   The men paid their own-Railway Fares (10s. 6rf. per week) to and from Poplar.Staff employed. A Staff of 162 persons is employed at the Institution.Hours of Duty. The building trade employees are engaged 44 hours per week, the -engineering staff 47 hours weekly, anJd the domestic staff, nurses, attendants, fee, are employed 48 hours weekly.Holidays. Fourteen days&apos; annual leave and each Bank Holiday, or a day in lieu thereof.Three whole-time window cleaners are employed at the Institution. The bulk of the windows are cleaned once a month and the remainder fortnightly. Bach man is paid  4 per week. This work is therefore costing the Guardians over  600 per annum, and I feel certain it would cost considerably less if done by contract. This staff, I consider, should be dispensed with and the! work done by contract.Four painters are employed at the Institution and one foreman painter. The only duties of the foreman, who is paid  4 19s. per week, are to mix the paint and supervise the four painters and three window cleaners employed. The annual cost of the labour employed in connection with the painting of the Institution is nearly  1,200.Three firemen are engaged day and night (eight hours each) at wages of  4 6s. Id. each and uniform. Their duties are to attend to hydrants, &amp;c., the flushing of drains, and to render assistance in case of fire. The one on duty at night also acts as watchman. I do not consider there is sufficient work for these men in an Institution of this size to keep them fully employed and I think that the services of at least one of the day firemen might be dispensed with. I understand the staff are instructed how to act in case, of fire and that the Guardians have a private wire to the nearest fire station, from which a fire brigade could reach the Institution in three minutes.The barber at the Institution has been&apos; receiving  5 12s. per week since July, 1920, and his wages have not since been adjusted], having regard to the reduced cost of living.(2) HUTTON SCHOOLS.Accommodation, number of chidren, cost, etc. These schools, situate at Shenfield, were completed in the year 1906 to accommodate 743 children requiring Institutional relief, at -a cost of about  173,000, or over  232 per head of accommodation provided. The- lavish expenditure on these buildings has been previously referred to by your Inspectors.The total cost of the administration of the Schools, the average weekly cost of main1-- taming each child thereat, and the cost of Salaries, rations and superannuation allowances of Officers and Servants for the three years ending 31st March, 1921 (shown in table &quot; E &quot; in the Appendix hereto), is as follows, viz. : 
The total cost of the work, which extended over a period of 5 months, was  3,706 18s. lOd. towards which  860 is due to the Guardians from the Unemployment Grants Committee. The Guardians originally estimated the cost of the work at  2,000.In a report made by Mr. F. O. Stanford, one of the Ministry of Health Engineering Inspectors, on a visit of inspection made by him on the 3rd March, 1922, he states: &quot; The Borough Surveyor visits the work about once a week. The time is kept and wages are paid under the supervision of the Head Master of the Schools (Mr. Dean). There is one ganger in charge. He is an assistant foreman gardener in the regular employment of the Borough Council. The Borough Surveyor considers him a capable man, but it appeared to me that he has insufficient control over the men, and I learned that he has no power to discharge any of them. I was told that the ganger-had no power to discharge he could only complain to the Borough Surveyor (once a week) if any man was unsatisfactory, and the Surveyor could only report to the Committee, who would deal with the matter. It transpired that only one man had been thus dealt with in the course of the work, and he had been transferred to other work, as a painter&apos;s labourer at the Schools.&quot; Obviously, with such insufficient authority, the ganger cannot be held responsible for getting a fair day&apos;s work. I also considered that there were too many men on the job for the size of the ground remaining to be dealt with for economical working. When this was pointed out, the three gentlemen present agreed to recommend that the-number should be gradually reduced.&quot; I formed the opinion that the excess cost of the work is due to wasteful mis-management on the part of the Guardians&apos; Committee. The men are slacking and making their job last as long as possible, and the ganger has no effective control.&quot;(3)   LAINDON FARM COLONY.The Farm Colony was opened in 1904 for the employment on the land of Able-bodied Male poor with the object of reforming them., improving their physical condition and training them in habits of industry, soi as to fit them to earn their own living. The Guardians rented the-Farm until 1908 when they purchased it for  2,125, and about  1,500 has been expended on additions since that year.The Farm Colony comprises 114 acres, including 13 acres rented from the Rector of Dunton, and the uses to which the- land is put include the growing of vegetables and fruit, grazing cattle, etc.The Farm&apos;Stock comprises 12 head of cattle, 25 pigs, about 300 fowls and five horses.The experiment like many other similar ones proved to be a failure and the Farm ceased to be used as a labour Colony in 1912. Since that time it has been carried on as a branch Workhouse.The total cost of the administration, the average weekly cost per head of the maintenance of the inmates and the cost of salaries, rations and superannuation allowances of officers and servants for the three years ending 31st March, 1921 (shown in Table &quot; E &quot; in the Appendix hereto), is as follows : 	Total cost.

Thirty of the inmates are occupied in cleaning and the remainder on the farm, /generally under two gangers.Leave of absentee is allowed to those who apply for it from Saturday to the following Wednesday inclusive, monthly, and return fares to Poplar are paid by the G-uardians. During their period of leave, the inmates either visit their friends in Poplar or stay at the Poplar Poor Law Institution, and are provided with breakfast and other meals if they go in for them. They are not booked as inmates, nor is any record kept of their temporary residence there.The Dietary of the inmates may be described as generous, and includes 5f ountees of butter per week, 26 ounces of cooked beef, mutton, bacon or pork, in addition tp sausage, .-sea-pie, fish, one egg, jam, &amp;c.   The following is a fair sample of the daily meals.Breakfast.Bread          .........	2 ozs.Porridge	11 pts.Tea    ......      ......	1 pt.Milk   ...     :.....	1 Pt.Lunch.

The following are described as disagreeable tasks at the -Colony, the performance of which carries with it the additional allowance of 1 oz. of tobacco, viz.: Emptying latrine buckets, Emptying cesspools, Assisting in pig killing, and Attending on sick inmates.The cost of tobacco for the year ending 31st March, 1922, was  304 8s. Id. The Farm is visited about three times monthly by a both Committee of the Guardians consisting of sometimes two and sometimes three members, and by the General Committee :monthly.There is a staff of eighteen, viz. : Superintendent. Stoker.. Matron- Housemaid.Visiting Medical Officer. Two Gangers.Assistant Superintendent. Two Horsemen.Cook. Horsekeeper.Watchman. General Assistant.Labour Master. Needle Woman.Second Labour Master. Stockman.The staff is excessive and unless the farm can be utilised for the purpose of providing test -work for the unemployed in receipt of relief for which in the existing circumstances there is urgent need, it should be disposed of and the imnates transferred to the Poplar Institution where there is ample accommodation for them.(4)   ST. ANDREWS HOSPITAL.This Hospital which is established under the Metropolitan Poor Act, 1867, for the joint use of the Parishes of Poplar Borough and Limehouse is managed by a Board partly nominated and partly elected, and consists of 14 members, eight of whom are elected by the Guardians of Poplar Parish, and four by the Guardians of Limehouse Parish, and two are nominated by the Ministry of Health. I have not paid a visit to this Hospital as it is not an Institution under the control of the Poplar Board of Guardians. The number of beds provided is 787 (Poplar 562 and Limehouse 225).The basis of contribution of the constituent parishes is : Rateable value for buildings and upkeep, and that of user for maintenance of patients. A statement of the various items of expenditure in connection with this Hospital for the five years ending 31st March, 1921, is : given in the Appendix (page        ). -
(5)   LANG-LEY HOUSE RECEIVING HOME FOR CHILDREN.This Institution as formerly a residence and was purchased by the Guardians and adapted as a receiving home with accommodation for 93 children about 19 years ago. The number of children in the home on the 31st March, 1922, was 68.The total cost of the administration of this home, the average weekly cost per head of the maintenance of each child thereat, and the cost of salaries, rations, and Superannuation Allow--ances of officers and servants for the three years ending 31st March, 1921 (shown in Table &quot; E &quot;in the Appendix hereto), is as follows, viz. : 	Total Cost.

The total number of staff at the date of my visit was 21, exclusive of the Medical Officer and the Chaplain^Although there has been a reduction of two whole-time officers and two part-time officers,, I consider the staff still excessive for the size of the Institution.GENERAL.Building and Repair Work Employment of Direct Labour. The Guardians engage direct labour to undertake all the building and repair work found to be necessary at their Institutions. If any work is to be executed which cannot be coped with by the permanent building trades staff, additional temporary labour is employed. Considerable economy could be effected by reducing the building trades staff to the minimum for ordinary repairs, and by having all other work executed under contract.Staff Trade Union Membership, etc. The Guardians have adopted from time to time, in respect of their Officers whose wages were not regulated, having regard to Trade Union Rates,, the War Bonus Awards, issued by the Civil Service Arbitration Boad. When Award No. 102 was issued, however, the Guardians decided that the bonus under this Award should only be paid to those Officers who were members of a Trade Union or an Association. This decision had the effect of causing practically the whole of the Officers to become members of a Trade Union ; the remainder joined an Association in connection with the Poor Law Service. Another result of the passing of this resolution was that Shop Stewards came into existence at each of the Guardians&apos; Institutions and at the Guardians&apos; Offices. These Shop Stewards,, who are elected by the Officers, call upon members of the staff from time to time to produce proof that they are either members of a Trade Union or of an Association.On the 31st August, 1921, the Guardians decided to authorise the Clerk to engage addi-tional Relief Staff required for investigation in Relief Cases, subject to the condition that the-persons engaged must belong to a Trade Union and be resident in Poplar. This, restriction has not given the Clerk a free hand in engaging the most suitable labour for the purpose of&quot; these investigations. At the same time, the Guardians decided that the temporary staff at Poplar Institution and Langley House Receiving Home must be residents in Poplar and Trade Union members, and dismissed 13 temporary employees who were not Poplar residents.Staff. Wages and conditions of labour of Trade Union Employees, etc. During the period of the War the Guardians increased the wages of the members of the staff engaged in occupations in which recognised Trade Union Rates of Wages prevailed, in accordance with-such Trade Union Rates, and when such rates began to fall the Trade Union reductions were-followed up to August, 1921.   From that month, however, up to the 6th March, 1922,&apos;the -Trade Union reductions were entirely disregarded by the Guardians.   Since the 6th March, 1922, the wages of these employees have been reduced to a slight extent, but they are still being paid an average of 2d. per hour in excess of the Trade Union Rates.   This excess repre-sents an approximate annual expenditure of  1,000.   The conditions of employment of the-permanent staff are also more favourable than the conditions laid down by the respective Trade Unions.   The Guardians&apos; employees, for example, enjoy an annual holiday of two weeks, and fhe usual Bank Holidays, with pay, and they also receive full wages when off duty on account of&apos;
sickness, for: a period not exceeding 26 weeks. In addition, they have the advantage of regular employment, and come within the Provisions of the Poor Law Officers&apos; Superannua-tion Act, 1896. The Guardians have also obtained exemption under the National Health and Unemployment Insurance Acts in respect of their permanent employees. The temporary staff, when off duty on account of sickness, receive full pay for two weeks and half pay for two weeks.The Guardians decided in February, 1922, that.  4 per week should be the minimum rate of wages for their workmen whose wages are ordinarily fixed in accordance with trade agreements with the. exception of a few workmen already receiving less than  4 per week.In August, 1921, the Guardians also decided that their employees, who were receiving Bonuses in accordance with the Award No. 102 of the Civil Service Arbitration Board, should be allowed to continue receiving the Bonuses in operation at that time for a further period of four months, although it was known that the amounts of Bonuses payable under the Award would be substantially reduced on the 1st September, 1921. This decision was afterwards reversed by the Guardians, in consequence of the Ministry refusing to sanction higher war bonuses than the Award provided for.On the 22nd February, 1922, a letter was read from the Poplar Borough Municipal Alliance forwarding to the Guardians copy of the following resolution : &quot; That the attention of the Poplar Borough Council and Board of Guardians is called to the fact that, notwithstanding the gradual reduction in the cost of living, and the agreements arrived at between Employers and Trade Unions as to the lowering of salaries, wages, etc., in accordance with such agreement, no steps have been taken by the Guardians to give effect to the same.&quot;Staff Superannuation Allowances. It is generally the practice of the Guardians, when an Officer or Servant becomes entitled to a Superannuation Allowance, to add a number of years in most cases the maximum period allowed by the Poor Law Officers&apos; Superannuation Act, 1896, viz., 10 years to the period of service of the Officer or Servant for the purpose of computing the amount of the Superannuation Allowance. Although the sanction of the Ministry of Health is required before this addition of years can have effect and in many instances the Ministry have declined to sanction the Guardians&apos; proposals the Guardians appear to be most persistent in their efforts to continue this practice.Workmen&apos;s Compensation Insurance. I find that the Guardians have not insured their staff to cover their liability as employers against claims under the Workmen&apos;s Compensation Acts. They have not created a sinking fund as an alternative, and all amounts due from them are paid out of revenue. If the Guardians were insured against this risk the insurance company would not only be more likely to exercise closer supervision in each case receiving compensation, but they would be carrying the risk in the event of serious fatal accidents to the Guardians&apos; employees.Revision of cases of persons receiving Institutional Relief. The Relief Regulation Order. 1911, provides that the case of every person receiving Institutional relief shall be reconsidered at or before the expiration of six weeks from the admission of the person to an! institution and thereafter not less frequently than once every twenty-seven weeks. I find that although the cases of children relieved by the Guardians at their Hutton School and at Langley House are revised in accordance with the above order, it has not been possible, owing to the pressure of work, to revise the cases oi persons relieved in Poplar Institution and the.Laindon Farm Colony during the past twelve months, and the cases of persons (over 700) chargeable to the Guardians in convalescent homes, sanatoria, epileptic colonies, training homes, homes for the mentally defective, certified schools, &amp;c., have not been revised during the past two- years.Recovery of Contributions by liable relatives. In many cases in which liable relatives fail to contribute the sums the Guardians order them to repay towards the cost of relief granted, the Guardians allow considerable periods to elapse before obtaining Magistrates&apos; orders. Inasmuch as the amounts fixed under the Guardians&apos; orders cannot be recovered by any legal process in case of failure to pay, the delay in obtaining Magistrates&apos; orders entails-loss of revenue.Financial Policy. It was decided at a meeting of the Guardians held on the 25th January, 1922, that the precept for the half-year ending March, 1922, made on the Borough Council for a total sum of  319,925 be reduced by  146,250. This action was taken on the ground that the amount paid by the Guardians out of the Poor Rates in respect of expenditure which would be repayable from the Metropolitan Common Poor Fund was equivalent to that amount, and the practice of the Guardians has been since that time not to levy by rates on Poplar any sum which would be payable as Poplar&apos;s share out of the Metro-politan Common Poor Fund. You have- sanctioned overdrafts and loans to assist the Guardians in pursuance of Section 3 (4) of the Local Authorities (Financial Provisions) Act, 1921, to the extent of  251,250 up to the 9th May, 1922 : of this amount  44,392 19s. Id. has been refunded to the lenders out of receipts from the Metropolitan Common. Poor1 Fund, leaving a balance of  206,857 0s. lid. of a sanctioned overdraft or loan.I have given in the part of this Report relating to Outdoor Relief an estimate prepared, by the Clerk to the Guardians of the amount which, he calculates, approximately represents the amount of such relief which will be refunded to the Guardians in respect of the half-year ended 31st March, 1922, from the Metropolitan Common Poor Fund, viz.,  182,510, in37150 0

CONCLUSIONS.The principal directions in which economy can be effected may be summarised as follows : 1. Outdoor Relief scale :  (a) Too generous.(6) Not regarded as a maximum, but given in all cases.(c) Insufficient deductions in respect of children&apos;s earnings in calculating the allowance of relief resulting in the granting of relief in cases in which no real destitution exists.(d) Relief allowed in excess of earnings of an independent workman who maintainshimself by his labour.(e) Grants of boots and clothing in addition to the scale. 2.   Indoor Relief : (a) Excessive staffs. :(b) Dietaries too liberal.(c) Employment of direct labour instead of contracting for execution of certain work.(d) Suggested discontinuance of Laindon Farm Colony or Branch Workhouse. 3.   General : (a) Payment of wages in excess of Trade Union Rates.(6) No systematic revision of cases of persons receiving Institutional Relief.(c) Loss in connection with recovery of relief from liable relatives. The administration of the Poor Law in this Parish is dictated by a policy adopted by the Guardians which is in many instances foreign to the spirit and intention of the Poor Law-statutes.addition to which there will be a repayment in respect of other expenditure of the G-uardians chargeable on that fund to the 31st March, 1922, as well as the estimated amount due in respect of the half-year ended 30th September, 1921 ( 45,000).Bates levied. The following statement shows the rates levied in the parish since 1914.
The principles which influence the Guardians in the excessive expenditure referred to in this Report are as bad as, if not worse than, those existing prior to the present Poor Law system.There is no justification for the expenditure in out-relief so much in excess of the scale prescribed by the Metropolitan Common Poor Fund (Gut-door Relief) Regulations, 1922. Based on the present number of cases these excess payments represent additional expenditure  which cannot be charged on the Metropolitan Common Poor Fund, and therefore falls on the Poplar ratepayers-at the rate of over  93,000 per annum.The lavish allowances of Out-door Relief encourage persons to apply who would not otherwise do so, and it is made altogether too easy for persons to obtain, assistance from the Guardians. The Guardians&apos; policy has a tendency to demoralise the recipients and is calculated to destroy incentive to thrift, self-reliance and industry.Although the Guardians have been surcharged by the District Auditor in respect of out-door relief granted by them in certain cases, on the ground that there was no destitution, which surcharges have been confirmed by you, but remitted on appeal, the Guardians have continued to grant relief in similar cases, of which instances are given in this Report, and others have been discovered by your General Inspector, Mr. Oxley.The Guardians&apos;&apos; neglect to institute proceedings in any cases of desertion, or of persons obtaining relief under false pretences, as a deterrent to others, provides another instance of their failure to correctly interpret -their duties.I consider that, on the present rate of expenditure, by careful administration, a saving of at least  100,000 per annum would result.I have the honour to be, Sir,Your obedient Servant,PL I.

A structurally separate set of premises may be defined as any room or set of rooms having separate access either to the street or to a common landing or staircase. Thus each flat in a block of flats is a structurally separate set of premises; a private house which has not been structurally sub-divided is similarly to be reckoned as one set of premises. But where a private house has been sub-divided into maisonnettes or portions, each having a front door opening on. the street or on a common landing or staircase to which visitors have access, then each such portion must be regarded as a structurally separate set of premises.TABLE G.STATEMENT RELATING TO PERSONS CHARGEABLE TO THE POPLAR GUARDIANS ON THE1st APRIL, 1922.Rateable Value and Expenditure.--	Class Maintained.
