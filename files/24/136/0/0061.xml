Other arrests are probable.The General Council of the Trade Union Congress yesterday decided to give the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; further monetary assistance, but has not yet agreed to take over the paper.

United Operative Spindle and Flyer Makers&apos; Trade and Friendly Society.The situation at present is serious and there is little doubt that the decision of the employers to :pen their sheps those men who will accept their terms will lead to friotlen possibly disorder.   It is not yet known to what extent the me have availed themselves of this offer but in Coventry there already signs of disturbance &amp;nd the Chief Ccnstable states that preparations are being made &quot;to subject to violence tho men who nay return to work.&quot;   On May 2nd between 5,000 and 6,000 engineers attended a meeting addressed by Jack Lerkie Bob Orrell and decided not to return to work.     Leokie, Gall and Dingley have a large following among the engineers and ai boasting that the whole district will be &quot;scab free&quot;.     On April 28th Leckie visited Derby and endeavoured to bring outf the men in the Rolls Royce works.The Chief Constable of&apos; Sunderland informs me that it hd&apos; been decided to picket engineering works on the Wear and the Wheeler of Newcastle has stated that the unemployed on Tynes are already organised ftr picketing. It is reported that om ef the non-federated shops in Sheffield has been visited and the men brought out. The Chief Constable of Leeds informsMtf that on April 28th five men were proceeded against for intimidation: there were two convictions, *ne discharge and cases were adjourned fer three months.The London District Council of the Communist Party has issued instructions for masB picketing at all shops.At present the engineers as a whole seem determined toreel

The following official of the new Scottish Divisional Council were appointed :-&quot;Chairman: Comrade DI an tyre, Renfrew, &quot;of theRelief Workers V.&apos;.e stern Divisional Council-Secretary: Comrade Carr,    Springburn, Glasgow.Treasurer: Comrade McShare, Gorbals District ofGlasgow.&apos; Mational Administrative Comrade   Currie, Dumfries.

Comrade Harkness, Clydebank.&quot; of Scotland:JT5E COMZmilSTS&apos;        &quot; &apos; &apos;&apos;&apos; . .While the rank and file of the-   Ccmmunist Party have been devoting their attention to the engineering crisis and to May Day celebrations, the Commission has been thoroughly overhaulingthe/
the Party machinery:    its chief concern at the moment seems to t)Jfinance and, in the interests of economy, Tom Clark, James GordolA. Hawkins, George Ebury, W. Gee, L. Kish, and Helen Crawfard halbeen struck off the pay-roll:    if, .however, they are unable to gfl&quot;other work&quot; or unemployed donation they will be--paid 21 per weejffor four weeks.    In order to soften the blow, the acting nations;organiser has informed branches that their services are availablfor propaganda purposes &quot;with a view of breaking new ground, orwork amongst the unemployed&quot; at the rate of  3 per week, plus &quot;fiand hospitality&quot;.   Helen Crawfurd does not view the suggestionfavourably and has said that &quot;I am not so down and out as thatif I were I would prefer a pennyworth of rat poison.&quot;The Commission has appointed Deacon to go through the Party books and has turned down the Executive&apos; s suggestion that it shoffcommunicate with branches through the acting national organiser,with the remark that it would deal with them direct.    They have instructed divisional organisers to make, a weekly return of expe:and a weekly report.of their activities..The &quot;speakers Classes&quot; in London have been suspended by thi London District Council &quot;because we could no longer afford to pa] the fares of the unemployed comrades&quot; but. will-be resumed if br will pay the fares.Communist activity inside London trade unions is maintained ctfmtmunist printers and paper workers have been instructed to worl for the election of &quot;sympathetic nominees&quot; to the London Committi of the union and members of &quot;the Workers&apos; Union have been instructions to send &quot;articles with a Party bias&quot; to: the official &quot;Record&quot;.The -Lancashire Divisional organiser is urging the Executive take over the Reformers1 Bookshops in Manchester and Bradford, as the sum of  2,000 Is required it is doubtful,,whether the transaction is feasible, although it has been suggested that &quot;comrades of some finanoial standing&quot; should float a company. :,According to the &quot;Daily Herald&quot;, the May Day issue of &quot;Frea
Oxford&quot; is to be the last, although Arthur Reade is optimistically appealing for  7,000 to start a new paper, &quot;The Rebel&quot;, on the lines of the American &quot;Liberator&quot;.   The Berlin Bureau of the Young Communist International is apparently interesting&apos; itself in the matter and on April 15th sent a v .    communication to &amp;?ade from.which the following extracts are taken:&quot;We are rather surprised that you write that the Y.C.L. does not like *The Free   Oxford1.   You have surely misunderstood our comrades.   We wish to make it quite clear that we quite agree with you, that your paper should continue to appear and we urge you to talk to our comrades of the CP. and the Y.C.L. as to the ways and means to resurrect &apos;The Free Oxford&apos;.   It 1b obvious that our comrades of the Y.C.L. had some doubts as^tp whether your paper published as &apos;A Ceraminist Journal of/Youth&apos; wasruite the right thing.   Our League (Y.C.L.) publishes an organ &apos;The Young Communist&apos; and it is only fair.that,this paper should be the communist journal of the youth.   This we think, you will understand and that is purely the meaning (if really) of the expression of &apos;not liking&apos; The Free Oxford&quot;Comrade, we hope that things can be mended.   We quite agree that your most valuable paper must reappear and we are ready to give you every assistance under certain conditions, which you will surely approve.    You suggest yourself that your object \r, to issue your new paper (old TFree Oxford1) on the&apos; lines of the &apos;Liberator&apos; or&apos;01arte&apos;.   , That is good;   That is we hope that you keep up this high standard, as in &quot;Free Oxford&apos;&apos; and at the same time run it as what it should be:    a paper for the propaganda of progressive thought and communism amongst intellectuals.   Then you will hear no longer, objections from the Y.C.L.   Let us hear soon your definite plan and then we shall see what we can do;for you.   We can assure you that we&apos;have, watched  &apos;Free Oxford&apos; with the. greatest attention and. as soon as we heard of your difficulties/we issued an appeal for assistance (viz. International&apos; Young Correspondence).    International solidarity is not an empty phrase.&apos; &quot;So in order to see &apos;Free Oxford1  (or whatever the name of, your paper will be) reappearing we urge you to &apos; discuss the matter with the C..?. and the Y.C .&apos;Lv and to submit us the definite plan regarding&apos; title,, issue, contents, etc   We have forwarded your letter to our E.G. and are sure that we can do something for you.   We do not ask you to put&apos;your paper: under control of the Y.C.L. as long as it. is published on the lines you state in your letter.    It will be the organ of the Intel!igensia and we have full confidence, in you.    However, ve should like to see.you co-operate more&apos;closely with the Y,C.L. and assist our Young League to, get along....&quot;We are. sure that a full agreement will be reached and that your paper will soon be 1punched again.   We remind you of the discussions our: representative had with&apos; &apos; ,&apos; \ -.1 you/
you last year in London and where we have outlined the oo-operation between the Y.C.L. and universities. That the future work is conducted on the lines of thiafi discussion and the thesis of the Y.C.I. regarding the &quot; work among students, this is our condition for supporting your paper. - We think that this is quite acceptable for you and we hope to hear from you soon.&quot;Discuss the matter friendly with our young comrades, outline your plan in particular to us and thel we shall find ways and means to help your paper. You J get a definite answer from our . 2.C. but so much we caul say already nor; that we think to be able to support deficit by means of international collections. This tol prove you our sympathy and the sympathy of the international youth we shall instruct our secretary of, the university (students) department to: keep in touch with you and hope to hear more often from you.&quot;Elizabeth Freeman has sent from Mew York to Saklatvalalthe following appeal, with the request that he will bring it before &quot;groups and individuals&quot;:&quot;Committee of British-Born Trade Unionists.F0J. Green, Sec, 418, Summit avenue, Jersey City, N*J.&quot;We the undersigned British-Born Trade Unionists in the U.S.A. believing that it is in the interest of: Labour Movement of the World, we appeal to the workersf of Great Britain to make- their protest on the May Pay celebration of 1922 on behalf of the thirteen (13) British-Bora workers who have been held as political prisoners in the gaols of America for the past four (4f years&quot;Their 1 crime1 wa3 educating and organising the workers on the industrial field, they were fighting ft -better standard of living, were loyal and unselfish if their efforts on the part of the working class:   but &quot;were accused of opposing the war, preventing enlis&apos;one: and organising strikes for better conditions.   Brutal prosecution has placed these men in prison for from five-to twenty years (5 to.20) because they were idealistic in their endeavours to benefit the Workers the World.&quot;The profound respect with which the British Labour Movement is held in high government places her in the U.S.A. is scarcely understood ir\ Britain. Wil not the British workers make good this opportunity to demand freedom, for those who have suffered so much in! the olass struggle? &quot;&quot;Wo urge the British Trade Unionist Movement to make their protest to the British Foreign Office, toAmbassador!
Ambassador Harvey at London, and to President Harding at Washington D.C., for the immediate release of these men.Erancis J. Green, Bricklayer formerly of Derby, Eng. Joseph Thompson, &quot; &quot; &quot;Leeds,    &quot;Joseph Thompson,Jnr. &quot; &quot;        &quot;       &quot;        &quot;Walter G.

Yorks.THE YOUNG COMMUNIST LEAGUEThe following extracts are taken from oommunioations datedApril 24th, 1922, and sent to the Young Communist League bythe Berlin Bureau of the Young Communist International:&quot;We have mailed you 1500 copies of the Theses which as it seems also went astray (they were sent in February). Then 1000 copies of each number of the CORRESPONDENCE and the YOUNG INTERNATIONAL.   Provide us with good addresses as we do not want to become 1 appointed to H.M.1.&quot;From our letters yon will see that we are not quite satisfied with your work.   We hope, however, that once the financial difficulties are overcome, you will be able to go ahead.     The news that your staff is going to be reduced to the person of Jimmy has caused much consternation.    Your letters have been forwarded to our E.C and we think that this measure should be cancelled.&quot;Up to now your Leagues as stated in your report has hardly 700 members.     This is not sufficient.  .Even taken in account that you had to overcome great financial difficulties and that you were handicapped by many other obstacles, we nevertheless think that if more practical organisational work had been done, more oould have been accomplished by this time.   We hope that from now on the relations will be much closer than in the past ana that you will put into practice all the advice we have submitted to you lately.&quot;Regarding Kid we consider that when you receive the subsidy which is promised&apos; you will be able to keep&apos; h:vm. Regarding the subsidy our E.C. decided to assist ycu so as to be able to continue work with the old staff.   As to the debts to the Party you should send us at once an account (endorsed by the Party) so\that we might settle this business.&quot;We emphasise againr however, that we can only allow you a very limited sum end insist upon that the League should as scon as possible become self-supporting. If you.ereato through a regular sale (which should be pushed) of ycur paper a source of income, that should be quite possible.&quot;v   &apos; ;MAY/
MAY day in London and in many provincial centres Hay Day was celebrated on Monday: attendances were, generally speakij. smaller than last year and&apos; in no case has disorder &quot;been re, ported: as is. usual on these occasions the communists con, trivedj by the use of banners and red decorations, to make a display out .of proportion to their real numbers.It is estimated that about 6,000 people participated in procossion in London, while about ll^OOO were present in Hyde Park, whore speeches were delivered from nine platfo on each of which there was a communist:    of the 45 spea&amp;en 17 were communists,     No influnmatory language was used support for the resolution was by no means unanimous:   mos of the audience around Nc3 platform were members of the Building Trades Union who resented the recent action of th chairman Jo Murray, who Is one of their officials, in accep a wages cut:    feeling became so high that Murray received blow on the nose which prevented him taking any further pa as chairman and his plaoe was taken by Skene McKay02ha omnibus   resolution covered the usual points butthe following sections of it bear repetition:&quot;!this Mass Demonstration, representing all sections of the London Labour Movements calls on the Japnnese Government; to fulfil its declaration at the Washing^ Conference and immediately and unconditionally witli-draw its troops from Siberia,&quot;It calls on the British Government to make representations to Japan to vithdraw her troops inn mediately and unconditionally from Siberian&quot;With a view to the launching of a victorious : counter- *off ensiye&apos; against the forces of plunder and privllogOfl it finally calls upon all sootions of the B^tiDli Labour Movement to adopt forthwith, the fol-lowujig minimum &quot;programme z-&quot;Resistance to all wage cuts and attempts to lengthen, working hours.&quot;Abolition of Overtime,,Wort,

Lamb (A.E.U.),. J*Hamilto.n (Independent Workers1 Education Committee), the Rev,J,Vint Laughland and Mrs*Walker,The Chief Constable of Coventry states that about 3,000 attended a meeting in Spencer Park, where the theme of the speeches was the need for organisation on the lines of the One Big Union:   the speakers included J,V0Leokie and Robert Yfilliams, the rival parliamentary candidates.     The demonstrators&apos; marched to Spencer Park from Pool Meadow:   several feeble attempts to sing the &quot;Red Flag&quot; en route ended in failure.    In the morningfrom/
from 500-600 unemployed were addressed by Leckie in the Corn ExchangeeThe Chief Constable of Birmingham informs me that the communist and labour groups held separate meetings, about 180 attending the former and about 250 the latter:   Harry Webb and Walton Uewbold were the chief speakers at the communist meetings in Southampton a fairly large audience was present at a &quot;Meeting of citizens&quot;, but the Chief Constable states that many attended from motives of curiosity;,   later in the; day Hodley addressed a meeting of about 300 unemployed*The Chief Constable of Plymouth informs me thqt 300-350 people, half of whom were women and children, took part in the procession, which was managed by Lew Davis and the organ-isod unemployed,,I le-irn from the Chief Constable of Cardiff .that :the meeting in that city attracted between 300-^400 people: no inflammatory remarks were made.Largo numbers listened to speeches from 14 platforms in Glasgow, but there were to untoward incidents.The Chief Constable of Edinburgh informs me that fully l^000, about 120 of whom were unemployed, took part in the local meeting and procession:   shipwrights.,plumbers, plaster-ers8 iron founders0 shipbuilders and engineers, as well as- . the Communist Party and Socialist Sunday Schools were repre-. sent-edo     William Gallacher was the principal communist speak-, er,Zinoviev sent the following &quot;May Day&quot; Message to this country:-.&quot;The first attacks cf the proletariat have been beaten off,.     In these preliminary encounters the bourgeoisie has been victorious, but their supremacyhas/
has been challenged and their throne is shaking:, (Tho&apos;&apos;&apos;;Rus3-ian Re-volution of 1905 was &quot;defeated1 &quot;by Nicholas tho Bloody^).&quot;Today the workers .of .the world are rallying their for-ms*   Their unity may&apos; take several years to achieve., &quot;but the final victory will&apos;fall.to&apos;.the working class3     This is as indubitable as the faot&apos;--that the first of May^follows the last day of  pril,&quot;The class-conscious workers of the world will demonstrate on May Day in support of Soviet Russia, which is being hotly assailed in Genoa by the Imperialist groupa     Should the Genoa Conference be broken up, the British workers and the workers the world over will understand that this is due to the pressure exercised on the politicians by a handful of big financial magnates vho, regardless of the ultimate cost to the peoples of Europe, insist on claiming their 1sacredT property, &quot;robbed1&apos; by the Russian Revolution^&quot;The workers of Great Britain will net lag behind the advanced workers of other nations.     We are confident that they will support the Russian Soviet Republic with all their mightr the bulwarks of the proletarian, movement of the world,- ; Not only in words but in deeds the British toilers will help to ;       achieve the ideal of one great united proletarian front against the capitalists and their flunkeys.&quot;The first of May, 1922, will witness the mobilisation of millions of workers ofell the world against the yoke of Capital ism-j&quot;The &quot;Daily Herald&quot; issued a &quot;May Day Supplement&quot; in which interesting features were lacking.iTSE INDEPENDENT LABOUR PARTY. &apos;&apos;;. .   . .The; full reports of the Thirtieth Annual Conference of;the Independent Labour Party at Easter call for little--&apos;  . comment:   the chief feature was the adoption of the draft.-programme with, very few alterations:   the clause dealingwith &quot;Method&quot; was amended by agreement and bears quotationin that.it is a. recognition of &quot;direct action&quot;:&quot;The I0L*P. takes its part in tho struggle of the wo3kers to win freedom from the economic tyranny imposed by the capitalist class and capitalist State. It holds that the best way of effecting a peaceful change to Socialism is by the organisation&apos;&quot; of the workers; pcOJ tieally to&apos;capture the power of the State, and industrially to take over the control and management of the industrial machine.The/
&quot;The Independent Labour Party recognises that circumstances may arise when a Government or re-aotionary class might attempt to suppress liverty or thwart the national will, and it holds that to defeat suoh an attempt democracy must use to the utmost extent its politioal and industrial power.wThe conference unanimously rejected a resolution advocates-oating a Liberal-Labour Alliance:   C.P.Trevelyan opposed the motion In a forcible speech, but has informed Philips Prioethat &quot;I donft disguise that the unanimity of the IndependentLabour Party may be far from shared by all labour.     ButoI believe that if we really stick to that polioy, we shall be too strong a phalanx for a contrary polioy to be adopted.The resolution advising the Labour Party to accept the affiliation of the Communist Party aroused very little in-terest:   only six branches appear to have supported the resolution which was opposed by Shinwell, who quoted JackBon^ remark at the Policy Conference that the Communists want to tako the Labour Party by the hand in order that they might take thorn by the throat.     Wallhead stated that the Labour Party and the Communist Party were in negotiation, but that the latter had failed to answer certain questions.Philip Snowden has resigned the treasurershlp of theIndependent Labour Party: The following officials were electedChairman   R.C. Wallhead. Treasurer Clifford Allen.-   National member^-of. the J,R*MaoDonaia.National Administrative 3?.W.J6wctt.Council. D.Kirkwooa.Neil McLean, M,P.REVOLUTIONARY &quot;EDUCATION&quot;The current issue of &quot;The Plebs&quot;, which is the organ *t the National Council of Labour CollegeB contains an interest-ing statement on negotiations with the General Council of tM Trades Union Congress regarding Government grants:   it willbe/
be remembered that at tho Cardiff conference last year, the Congress accepted the recommendations of the Trado Union Education Enquiry Committee as the basis of a soheme whereby &quot;the varied educational needs ana demands of Trade Unionists may bo met&quot; and instructed the General Council to co-operate with that committee as to the best means of giving effect to the aims and objocts of the enquiry,  noluding the taking over and running of existing Trade Union colleges, such as Ruskin and the Central Labour College.This resolution brought into existence the &quot;Joint Committee on Education Facilities for Trade Unions&quot; which   has asked the Labour Colleges for details of their curricula and answers .to the following questions:-(a) &quot;Is the Labour College Movement prepared toaccept Government grants provided there are no conditions attached to them?(b) &quot;Is it willing to be run under the Trade UnionCongress, provided that its principles, policy and curriculum are guaranteed against inter-feronoe9&quot;It is worthy of note that the 23 Labour Colleges and class centres affiliated to the National Council of Labour Colleges, are the fountain head of Marxism:   in fact it is an open question whether some are not a greater menace to the present system than is tho Communist Party.     The London Labour College has trained many of the ablest propagandists In the South Wales coalfields, while the Scottish Labour College numbers among its staff John McLean, James Clunie, Hugh Hinshelwood and Patrick Lavin:   a Government grant to some cf these oolleges would be in effect a subsidy of revolutionary.propaganda.     There are, of course, other organisations such as the Workers1 Educational Associations and the Workers1 Educational Trade Union Committee whose activities are praiseworthy and quite untainted by revelu-tionary propaganda.IRISH/
IRISH BEYOLUTIONAHY ACTIVITIES IN GRBA3 BRITAIN,Recently tho activities of agents of the Republican I.R.A. in the North of England acquiring arms and ammunition , for shipment to Ireland has &quot;been noticeable.     The chief agents were known to &quot;be P,0*Dalaigh of Liverpool, Scanlon of Manchester and Cunningham of Birmingham,     On April 26th in-formation was received of a meeting of &quot;Purchase agents&quot; to arrange for transport and other matters.    During the week end eight men have &quot;been arrested - six in Birmingham (including Cunningham ana&quot; a well-known looal Communist) and two in Liver, pool - the former being caught red-handed inside a magazine belonging to the Premium Aluminium Casting Company, and in the act of removing a considerable quantity of ,303 ammunition, stored there for the purpose of being broken up.Papers seized at Birmingham and Liverpool disclose an extensive conspiracy&apos;to obtain arms, explosives, etc., either! by purchase or &quot;by robbery, for the uso of &quot;General&quot; Rory 0&quot;Connor1s mutinous section of the I.R.A.There are indications all over the country of an early &quot;break up of the Irish Self Determination League.     The extreme wing of the organisation is restless and wants to rid itself of the Free Staters.   , There is talk of organising a Republio League to replace the Irish Self Determination League.     The Republicans are mainly airecting their attention to the break-ing up of existing branches of the Irish Self Determination League especially where there is a majority favourable to the Eree State.Art 0*Brien, C.B.Dutton and others prominent in the movement in London make ne secret when speaking to their friends that their sympathies are with the extremists.There is great activity in both sections of the I.R.A.in/
in Scotland, each side endoavouring to come out on top.Many of the rank and file board little whioh side they supportso long as they see the possibility .of a good job in sight.Although a certain number of loyalist refugees from tha South of Ireland have arrived in this country, the newspaper reports on this subject appear to be exaggerated.     Ex- R.I.C. men are arriving in considerable numbers and are being acconw nodated in various parts of the country.
