,   [This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majestys Government]SECRET.CP. 3944.CABINET.SPECIAL REPORT ON UNEMPLOYMENT.No. 64WEEK  ENDED APIilL 14 1922.THE  SITUATION.The chief factor in the industrial situation continues to be the dispute in the engineering and shipbuilding industries; otherwise there are some signs of increased activity, and a slightly more hopeful tone prevails in many districts. In coal-mining, however, the position generally is not so good, and in iron and steel there is a slight backward tendency. Future prospects in the engineering and shipbuilding industries are, of course, dependent upon the dispute, but the amount of repair work available continues to be rather larger than was anticipated. The effects of the dispute have been felt most in the East Midlands and North of England; in other areas the effect has been far less general than was anticipated. The improvement in the motor section of the engineering trade continues.In the textile industries cotton continues to improve by slow degrees, and the position in the wool trade is still improving. There has been some temporary employment in Dundee which has suspended discharges in the jute trade. Hosiery continues to improve, but progress in the lace industry is very slow. The position in the boot and shoe trade is fairly good. There has been a marked stimulus in the clothing, making-up and needle trades generally, and also in building and decorating, though this is mainly due to seasonal activity.Discharges still continue in Government establishments, particularly in the South of England, but, generally speaking, there are slight indications of improve-ment in a large number of industries, together with hopeful revivals though on a very small scale at present in a large number of firms which, when working full time, absorb a good proportion of local labour. The demand for building materials remains small, but there are signs of improvement in the furniture trade. Slackness is reported in the leather and tanning industries.T. J. MACNAMARA,Ministry of Labour3Printed for the Cabinet.   April 1922.

[From Autumn 1.920 to Autumn 1921.]Cabinet Unemployment Committee.The prospect of a severe trade depression first became evident in the early autumn of 1920. On the 13th August, 1920, there was a special discussion at a meeting of the Cabinet, when the Cabinet Unemployment Committee was appointed to consider the whole question and devise means for relieving unemployment.(A.) Unemployment Insurance.An Unemployment Insurance Act of general scope came into operation on the 8th November, 1920. The Act applied compulsory insurance against unemployment to 12,000,000 persons as compared with 4,000,000 previously. Subsequent amending Acts modified the conditions as regards rates of benefit, extended the periods of benefit and increased the contributions. As from November 1921 the Unemployed Workers&apos; Dependants&apos; (Temporary Provision) Act, 1921, made temporary provision for grants in respect of wives, dependent husbands and children, and imposed a special levy to provide for these grants. The Unemployment Insurance Act, 1922, which operates as from the Oth April, 1922, amalgamates the dependants&apos; grants with Unemployment Benefit, and the special levy with the Unemployment Insurance contributions, and extends until June 1923 the special periods during which &quot; uncovenanted &quot; benefit may be drawn. The authority to borrow money from the Treasury is increased to  30,000,000 for Great Britain.Table showing amount paid out in Unemployment Benefit and the contributions during the period November 8, 1920, to April 8, 1922.

Unemployment in the Greater London Area, April 10.
(B.) Emergency Works and other Measures.A full statement of the measures taken in the autumn of 1920 and of the later measures from autumn 1921 onwards has been set out in previous issues of this Report. At least 250,000 men have had employment on these schemes at various times, and at the present time over 135,000 men are employed, exclusive of the work provided for men in ancillary occupations and the effect of the Export Credits and Trade Facilities Act schemes (see table below).SUMMARY SHOWING THE LABOUR EMPLOYED AT APRIL 7, 1922, ON CERTAIN OF THE SCHEMES REFERRED TO ABOVE.Scheme.

Unemployed Workers&apos; Dependants&apos; Fund.*The estimated income of this Fund for the period the 7th November, 1921, to the 8th April, 1922, was  4,790,000. The estimated amount paid out as grants for the period the 10th November, 1921, to the 8th April, 1922, was  3,590,000. (In both figures the amounts for Northern Ireland are excluded as from the 31st December, 1921.)The number of claims made in Great Britain and Southern Ireland up to the 3rd April, 1922, was 1,253,737. Of these, 1,117,649 were authorised, of which number 305,495 were in respect of dependent wife, housekeeper or invalid husband only; 116,694 were in respect of children only; and 695,460 were in respect of both classes of dependants.The number of claims current at the above elate was 641,260.* Amalgamated with the Unemployment Fund as from A.pril 6, 1922.
