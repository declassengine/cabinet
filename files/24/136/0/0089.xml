(This do oumept .1b- the &quot;property ^of Hi s-Britannic Majesty^ Government.)3CABINET.. 3988,ECONOMY (MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS) BILL.Inclusion of a clause relating to the Consolidation of Police Forces.Memorandum by the Home Secretary.I Bubmit for the consideration of the Committee a draft clause relating to the Consolidation of Police Forces, - which I suggest might be included in the Economy (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill.The Geddee Committee in their Report on the Polioe (Scotland) made a recommendation that the Secretary for Scotland should have power to enforce amalgamations of Police Forces where he thinks they would be economical without loss of efficiency (see paragraph 4 of the chapter relating to Police (Scotland) in the Second Interim Report.)   The Committee did not mention the matter in their Report on Police (England .,and Wales), but of course the same considerations apply in both Countries.The Desborough Committee in their Second Report of 1920 made a! strong recommendation in favour of the enlargement of units of Police administration on the grounds of efficiency. In particular, they strongly recommended that the small Borough Forces should be merged in the County Forces.   They called attention to the fact that a similar recommendation had been made   in the Report of the Departmental Committee on Local Taxation in 1914.Since the Desborough Report was issued several small Boroughs have voluntarily consolidated their Forces with the County Force, but there are still about eighty forces with less than 50 men, and some have very many less.
For example the total strength of the Congleton foroe is 13&quot;     *   Penzanoe      M       n 16 w     ii   Tiverton      M      w 11 &quot;     &quot;   Oil the roe,   w      w 15 &quot;     &quot;   Carmarthen   &quot;       &quot; IS. There is no   doubt that some considerable saving could be effected by the policy of amalgamation particularly   in the salaries of superior officers.   Any proposals to effeot this object will :.no doubt arouse considerable opposition in Parliament from the representatives of the Borough authorities, but the present seems to be a suitable occasion for effecting a reform which is required on grounds of efficiency as well as of eoonomy.   some reoent incidents have reinforced the oase for amalgamation on grounds of efficiency.   For example a serious disturbance took place at Newark a fortnight ago as a result of labour trouble and the Borough Foroe consisting of a Chief Constabl 3 Sergeants and 16 Constables waB quite inadequate to deal with it. It is clear that small Forces are not suitable for dealing with emergencies,: &apos;     ;I understand the Secretary for Scotland will be prepared to agree to the inclusion in the Bill of a provisio,n on this subject, and I recommend that a clause should be inserted as in the draft attached. ; : &quot;/ .IS.

Economy (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill.DRAFT CLAUSES.Consolidation of Police Forces.(1) Where it appears to a Secretary of State that in the interests of efficiency and economy it is desirable that the police establishments of a county and of a borough, not being a county borough, should be con-solidated, he may communicate with the standing joint committee of the county and the council of the borongh with a view to an agreement for the consolidation of the forces being effected under and in accordance with section fourteen of the County Police Act, 1840, as amended by section twenty of the County and Borough Police Act, 1856.(2) If within three months after the date of such communication the standing joint committee and borough council have failed to agree together for the consolidation of their police establishments, the Secretary of State may, after holding a public inquiry, fix the terms and con-ditions and time upon and from which the consolidation shall take effect; and thereupon the provisions of the said County Police Act, 1840, as so amended, shall become applicable as if the consolidation had been effected by an agreement under the said section fourteen thereof, save and so far as those provisions relate to the termination of such an agreement, and where consolida-tion has been so effected it shall be lawrful for the Secretary of State subsequently to vary the terms of the consolidation or to determine the consolidation on such terms as he may think just.(3) If at the time when such communication is made the office of chief constable of the borough is vacant, or if. at any time thereafter, whilst negotiations or pro-ceedings under the foregoing provisions of this section are pending, such office becomes vacant, the vacancy shall not be filled, but the council of the borough shall appoint some other officer of the police force of the borough to act as chief constable, until the consolidation is effected, or the Secretary of State decides that \o consolidation shall be effected, as the case may be. 145-1
(   2   )(4) It shall tie lawful for the standing joint com-mittees of any two or more adjoining counties to agree together for the consolidation of their police establish-ments, and it shall be lawful for the councils of any two or more adjoining boroughs having separate police forces to agree together for the consolidation of their police establishments.Any such agreement shall contain the terms and conditions on which the consolidation is to be effected, and shall provide for the government of the consolidated force and the manner in which constables are to be appointed and dismissed, and may amongst other things provide for the constitution of a joint police authority for the counties or boroughs, and it shall be lawful for the Secretary of State to make such order as may be necessary for giving effect to any of the provisions of the agreement.
