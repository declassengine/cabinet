C.P. - 5942. POST OFFICE CHARGES.(Further Memorandum by the Postmaster General). ;Before the Cabinet comes to a final decision on the reduction of postal charges, I desire to call attention to some considerations which were not sat out in my original memorandum C.P.3792, and to reply to some points contained in the Chancellor of the Exchequer&apos;s memorandum C.P, 3793.Since my memorandum was circulated on the 2nd March 1922 the Post Office Estimates for the current year have been approved by the Treasury and they make a substantial change in the position from what it.- then was.   I had estimated for a surplus on the Commercial accounts of  8,100p00 and on the Exchequer accounts of  5,140,000.   I now estimate that the surplus on the commercial accounts will amount to  9,320,000 and on the Exchequer accounts to  6,453,000.   This difference is due, as to  470,000 to my having made the cuts recommended by the Geddes Committee and as to  750,000 to the transfer of the Pest Office in Southern Ireland to the Irish Free State. The estimated surplus of  9,320,000 compares with a deficit last&apos;year of about  2,000,000 and for the year 1920-21 of  7:, 000,000.    The imprgvement in the position is due mainly to a reduction in Post Office estimates of expenditure for the current year of  13,350,000.    This figure, however, includes the saving due to the elimination of the postal services in the South of Ireland.   Excluding these services and comparing Hire&quot;with like the reduction in expenditure is  10,300,000. I emphasise this reduction in Post Office expenditure of  iov&apos;300,000 because the Chancellor of the Exchequer says in * his memorandum &quot;The surplus, which is a commercial account, ;U&apos;. &apos;&quot;&apos; meeting an Exchequer account surplus, is still only an estimated,.surplus.&quot;(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITAHI-ilO 1.AJEST1 &apos;S Oi-Oy^JffLEET ) SECRET.CABINET.
surplus.&quot;   As the Post Office estimates of expenditure show a reduction of  10,300,000, I submit that in estimating for a surplus on the commercial account of  9,1:320,000 I have proceeded on a conservative assumption and that a surplus of at least that amount is as assured as anything can be in estimating for a year ahead.In his memorandum to the Cabinet the Chancellor of the Exchequer says &quot;From the Budget point of view the Treasury are more interested in the Post Office Exchequer account (a comparison of cash reoeipts with cash expenditure) than with the commercial account.&quot;   I do not agree with this view and I would call the attention of the Cabinet to their decision of March 51st 1980 whioh was &quot;That as a matter of principle the Post Office must pay its way. due regard being had to the services rendered by it to all other Government Departments&apos;&apos;&quot;The Exchequer Account pays no regard to the services rendered by the Post Office to other Government Departments because no cash passes,   I submit therefore that the principle has already been   decided by the Cabinet that the real surplus is the commercial account surplus of  9,380,000 and not the Exchequer account surplus of  6,453,000.   Apart from the question of principle I think it would be diffioult to frame a moro unpopular proposal than that the user of the Post Office should pay unnecessarily high charges because the Post Office is providing free services for other Government Departments.During the first few months of my Office, the suggestion was repeatedly made in questions by Members of the House that the increase in the postal charges was due to the Post Office having to render free services to other Departments.    I replied to all these questions that there was no foundation for the suggestion because the Post Office received in its commercial account oredit for the value of these Government services. There would certainly be a considerable outcry in the House,  rid T think in the Country if it now appeared that the commercialaccounts
account a which included, this credit were discarded in favour&quot; o.C the Exchequer account in which no such credit is taken.The proposals I have submitted to the Cabinet ask that a sum of  7,500,000 out of the estimated surplus of  9,520,000 should be allocated to the reduction of charges.    That allocation, however, represented an estimated loss of revenue of  7,500,000 if the reduced charges had cone into force on April 1st.   Tho postponement of the decision alters the situation and tho amount that will be required to carry out the reductions 1 have oug osted will now be loss than  7,500,000.A month&apos;s notice will be necessary  from the time the Cabinet takes its decision before the Pott Office will bo in a position to make the reductions effective.    This will mean that the reduced charges cannot come into force before the 1st of June.    If the date of tho reductions is fixed at the 1st of June the amount required in the current yoar to carry out my proposals will be not  7, 500,000 but  (T,250,000 out of the estimated surplus of  9,520,000.In my memorandum I based the case for the reduction of postal charges on two grounds, the first being that the Government was pledged to give the Pest Office user the benefit of any reduction in Post Office expenditure, and the other that reductions were desirable in the interests of trade.    The Chancellor of the Exchequer in his memorandum takes a much narrower view than 1 do of the Government pledge,    he says &quot;The pledge relied upon by Mr, Kellaway only affects certain specific increases and, ought not to be extended to cover all increasesi of charges since 1914&quot; .The statement I have underlined must have been made under a misapprehension.    I have not proposed to extend tho pledge to cover all increases of charges since 1914..   My proposals do not touch any of the increases in charges made in 1915 and in June 1918 when the letter rate was increased from Id. to l?jd.&apos;.postcards &quot;-&apos;&apos;
postcards from \d to Id. and tho minimum charge for te la grants from  d. to 9d.   Liy proposals only cover the increased charges decided upon in hay 1920 and announced to tho ttouse &quot;by the then chancellor of the Exchequer in hi a budget speech of - that year.-The decision of the Government on -/hich I rely is giysn in the Minutes to the Cabinet pf nay 12th 1921 and is in these terms. &quot;Tho Government recognise that when costs are reduced the us er of the postal services is entitled to get the benefit ,and that ouch reductions as are possible in the rates nov.r imposed will bo made as soon as a surplus on tho Post Office balance sheet is assured.&quot;    This I submit Lays down the general principle that when Post Office costs are reduced the usor of the-postal services is entitled to get the benefit,    Oosts having been reduced by some  10,000,000 can it be said that either the letter - pr the spirit of this pledge will have been carried out if the user of the Post Office benefits by anything less than. 7-g- millions in a full yoar or      millions if the reduced charges come into force on the 1st of. June. &apos;In summarising his reply to my proposal the Chancellor of the Exchequer says &quot;&apos;Te should keep the 2d. letter1&apos;.   I dissent, fr&amp;n this view.   A reduction in the letter rate will benefit every household in the land.    Postcards, printed papers and telephones are only used hy a.comparatively small section of the community but the letter is in universal use.    The present high charge for a letter, the highest reached in this country since the days of Howl and Ei&apos;11&apos;s great reform, is felt to bo a burden by the great mass of the working class electorate as well as by the business community.    To make the other reductions and to leave the letter at 2d. would in my view be to fritter away a great opportunity of proving to the country ha at the Government is in earnest in its determination to reduce the burden of Government charges.Unless.the Post Office io frankly to be regarded as a taxing department there is no justification for charging 2d. fora
a letter, for the cost of carrying a letter on the present reduoed expenditure of the Post Office is only just over a Id,Taxation &quot;by postal charges is indirect taxation of the most objectionable kind..   The right view was expressed&apos; by&apos;.ur. -Gladstone Ih the words &quot;I rank the introduction of cheap postage for letters, documents, patterns and printed matter   * * *fr in the catalogue of legislation for promoting oonditi ons of abundant employment&quot;.I have enthusiastically defended the decision of the Cabinet that the Post Office ought not to-be subsidised.   lay experience as Postmaster General has convinced ne that a subsidised Post Office might well become an Instrument for the corruption.of a great body of public servants.   But with equal earnestness I take the view that the Post Office ought not to be treated as a taxing department, and it is being so treated if charges are kept on a level beyond what is justified by the cost of the services.It is not necessary for me to emphasise the importance to industry of the cheapest possible postal communication.    Other countries attach so much importance to it that there is no other postal administration in the world which is not at present subsidisede   This country led the world along the road of cheap posts,   The present charges are the highest ever reached since 1854.    They were justified as being the only means of avoiding subsidies from the State but now - that&apos;that danger has passed away I hope that the Cabinet will not hesitate in making tho largest reductions consistent with tho solvency of the undertaking..-&apos;-
