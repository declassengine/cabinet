S DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OE HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT&quot;NPIDENTIAI. I.P&apos; 3949 .CABINET. LEAGUE    OE   NATIONS..  AMEl^MFNTS TO THE, COVENANT&apos; ADOIVTED BY THE SECOND&quot; AS SFMBLY.Attitude of French Government in regard to Amendments to Article VI. (Expenses of the League.)Circulated with reference to 0.p.3732.SOCIBTB DES NATIONS. League cf Nations,Geneva.April 20th, 1922.Sir,On the 21st November last I had the honour to transmit to the British Government a copy of the Budget of the League of Nations for the year 1922.   At the same time I submitted certain explanations as to the method of apportionment of the expenses and a3 to the amount cf the contribution which the Government of the British Empire would be called upon to pay.I endeavoured to explain in my letter that it was, at the time of writing, impossible for me to indicate tho exact amount of-the contribution for 1922, since its determination depended upon the action which JCembero of the League might take in ratifying or otherwise certain amendments to the Covenant which had secured the approval of the second Assemb^.For the sr.,ke of clearness perhaps I may be permitted to repeat the proposed amendments.   Three resolutions were adopted1.    &quot;That the last paragraph of Article 6 of the Covenant shall be replaced by the following paragraph:&quot;The e;vpon3e3 of the League shall be borne by the Members of the League in the pro-portion decided toy the Assembly.&quot;2- ,   &quot;That the following paragraph shall be added to Article 6 of the Covenant, as amended:-&quot;The allocrxtion of the expenses of the League set out in Annex 3 shall be applied as from January let, 1922, until a revised allocation has come into force after adoption by the Assembly.&quot;3.-   &quot;That a new schedule ohp-ll be inserted inthe Annex to the Covenant (see C.432.H.311. 1921. X, page 47).&quot;
Kbw, in order that any er all of the above proposals may become operative, it is necessary that ratification be given on the part of the Governments (a) of all the States represented upon the Council, and (b) of a majority of the Members of the League.The French Government has officially informed me that, while they hope to secure ratification of the first proposal viz., that empowering the A33embly to decide upon the pro-portion in which the expenses of the League shall be borne, the French Government has decided net to submit the second and third proposals for ratification by the Chambers.Since to become effective an amendment to the Covenant must be ratified by all the States represented upon the Council, it is obvious that there is no possibility of the second and third amendments quoted above coming into force during the present year.    I have, therefore, the honour to inform the British Government that, as the system in use by the Universal postal Union must remain operative, the sum which, according to the Covenant, falls to the British, Government as its contribution for 1922 will be 1,011,335 gold francs, equivalent to 195,140.47 dollars American.I have the honour to be, Sir,Your obedient Servant,(Sgd.) ERIC LRUIdlOED,Secretary-General.The Right honourable the Prime Minister of the British Government, c/o The Secretary of the Cabinet,2 Whitehall Gardens, LOHDOH, 8.W. 1.2 Whitehall Gardens, S.\7. 26th April, 1922.
