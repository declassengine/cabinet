There was a raid on a factory at Great Bookham on April 11th and mass picketing ia reported to have he en prohibited at Rugby.Little progress towards a solution of the shipyard dispute lappears to have been made.On April 3rd the wholly unemployed on the live registerItotalled approximately 1,742,517, an increase of 2,753 on the previous week:   the number of short time workers on that date was 209,000.The recent meeting of representatives of the three Internationals lin Berlin resulted in compromise, but little real progress towards a &quot;&quot;United Front&quot; for Labour has so far been made.The Commission which is making recommendations to the ommuni3t Party for the application of the Decisions of the Third ongress of the Communist International in this oountry is now Hting.A detailed pay-roll of the over-ground members of the Communist &apos;a*&quot;ty is given in this report.
THE COMMUNISTSAs a preliminary to the reoent meeting of theSecond, Third and Vienna Internationals at Berlin,negotiations took place at Frankfurt on February  4th:Great Britain, France, Belgium, Italy and Germany were represented:   P.W. Jowett, R. Wallhead, Tom Shaw, M.P.,and Ben Tillett, M.P., were the delegates, from thiscountry, Tom Shaw and Georg Ledebour (Germany) acting as presidents.   The following programme for the rehabilitation of Europe was formulated:1.   &quot;Acceptance of the principle of payments in labour and in kind by Germany.2.     Establishment of an International institution for Rehabilitation to control all raw materials and labour necessary for the work of restoration.S.     Cancellation of the debt contracted byGermany for War Pensions.   This debt shall be made an international liability.4.     Cancellation of international war debts.5.     Credits to those countries whose purchasing power is temporarily ourtailed.6.     Formation of an International Institution fer the granting of credits.7,    Establishment of an International Court ofArbitration to settle all differences arising in the application of the foregoing.&quot;A long statement was also issued with regard to disarmament.     &quot;This problem required the considerationof a general conference of all the Socialist partiesthroughout the world; ...and the conference was incomplete agreement with the decisions of the InternationalCongresses of Metal Workers, Miners, Transport Workers,and the.,I.F.T.U. to declare a general strike in the eventof a new war.&quot;On/
On April 2nd the conference of the three Internationa]assembled in one of the halls of the reichstag:    Tom Shaw,Ramsay McDonald and William Gillies represented GreatBritain on the Second International and   Radek, Buoharin,Smeral, Rosmer, Frossard, Katayama and Clara Setkinrepresented the Third, MacManus and Gcllacher being unableto attend.     The conference concluded on April 6th havingoentred round the three following questions:1.    &quot;Can the;--Second and the Communist Internationals find a compromise on the prinoiple of &apos;cell-building&apos; in trade unions?2,    &quot;Will the Communists agree to allow a Commission of Inquiry to visit Georgia, and advise the Soviet Government to withdraw its army of occupation?3.   &quot;Will they&apos;allow the trial of the Social Revolutionaries now -imprisoned in Moscow &quot;    by an impartial tribunal, and also the defence of the S,-Rsn by a nominee &apos;bf the Second &apos; International, in the person of Taudervelde?&quot;Radek eventually stated that the   Bolsheviks were opposed to the breaking up of trade unions, but would fight against the reformists and for the revolutionary spirit in these organisations:    they would agree to an investigation of the conditions in Georgia by a commissi formed from the executive committees of the&apos;three Internationals and would, support Vandervelde&apos;s desire to defend the social revolutionaries now imprisoned in MosoA resolution was adopted to appoint a committee of nine members for the purpose of organising future confer of the three Internationals, as well as conferences to wf parties belonging to none of the Internationals might be invited.A further resolution was passed that the committee should endeavour to bring about conversations between tn International Federation of Trade Unions and represental of the &quot;Red&quot; trade unions, for the purpose of considerii
how the trade union front might be restored and maintained.The conference further urged the workers of all countries to hold demonstrations on April EOth or May 1st in favour of:&quot;The eight-hour day;&quot;Measures against unemployment (which evil it declares has been vastly aggravated by the reparation policy of capitalist Powers);&quot;United action of the proletariat against the capitalist offensive;&quot;The resumption by all countries of political and eoonomio relations with Soviet Russia; and&quot;The restoration of the proletarian front everywhere.&quot;Although this conference has resulted in the apparent achievement of a united front it is very doubtful whether the deep gulf between the groups has been bridged or their jealousies eliminated;   many of the discussions were acrimonious.It is reported that at the session of the Enlarged Executive Committee of the Communist International which opened in, the Kremlin on February 21st, a Commission of five members was appointed for the discussion of the &quot;English question&quot;:   the findings of the Commission are not yet definitely known.The first meeting of the Commission set up. by the Communist Party to make detailed recommendations for the application of the &quot;Decisions&quot; of the   Third Congress of the Third International was held on M march 29th:     R. Palme Dutt of the labour Research Department, was elected chairman and the other members are H. Pollitt and H. Inkpin, brother of the general secretary of the   Party who is now in prison.Probably as a result of the meeting of the Commission branohes have been circularised regarding the Importance of communist nuclei:   these nuclei correspond to some extentwith/
with the germ oells and are no doubt intended aa bases of underground activity.   Prom evidence now in my possession bhere is little doubt that a fairly comprehensive underground organisation now exists in the country and covers correspondence codes, wireless receiving sets, secret printing presses and facilities for manufacturing passports.    Instructions are believed to have been issued from Moscow to the effect that propaganda must in future be carried on with much greater secrecy and this may account in part for the curtailment of funds in connection with the open work of the Party.The Commission has been informed that the following is the present pay-roll of the Party:ExecutiveNameA.

A weekly bulletin is being issued of which labour papers are asked to reprint extracts, if not the whole.   The balance sheet of the recent Russian famine bazaar shows that a sum of 45/- was paid to three ex-policemen &quot;to protect the&apos; jewellery exposed for sale on an open stall&quot;:   the sale of the said &quot;jewellery&quot; realised  1.6.0.&apos; - -v..&quot;  .The question &apos; of relations between the Communist Party, Red International of Labour Unions and.-the-Workers1 Committees was again considered hy the Partyrs sub-executive on April 7th and delegates&apos; expenses.were paid hy the .

It is impossihle for me&apos; to. dee you before I leave as I have an enormous accumulation of work to get through.     I greatly regret I could not see you in Mosoow as my time was more than taken up with the International Delegation, who were under my charge and care., .....When last I saw Peet he told me that you weredisappointed that I had not furnished any report .. regarding my mandate as British delegate to the .. International Co-operative Bureau which had been endorsed ay the Executive of the Communist Party. I can appreciate your surprise, whioh is only exceeded, by my own.     When I was in Mosoow recently I was greatly surprised to he told that no mandate to act as British delegate had been reoeived from the CP. and consequently they had haver summoned me i .     to any.meetings of the International.   Under these * circumstances you will-see I could, not furnish any reports.   As the All Russian Co-operative Sooiety has been accepted as a member of the , International Co-operative Alliance (at the Basle Congress) the International Co-op. Bureau has oeased to function in Moscow.     I greatly regret that as I have,been very little in England during the. last six months I have not been able to take any aotive part in the. political work of the party, this is not only due to my absence from the -Country, hut also because;   have been expressly -  forbidden, in view of tho work I am doing for Russian Co-operation to do, so.     I am now writing to Mosoow to get this embargo removed as I am very anxious to get back to active political work. When I return from Italy I,will look you up, when I will discuss with you as to how I can help the party,&quot;Speaking&quot; at Manchester on April 1st, Mr.J.H.Youngs, a director of the Co-operative Wholesale Society, stated that in regard to the shipment.of goods to the value of about  63,000 in 1919, Russia still owed the sooiety  39,000:   (paymeint had been promised &quot;by December 1920).

Tom Mann has an artiele in the current issue of &quot;All Power&quot; in which he states that the General Council of the Trades Union Con-gress should call out all railwaymen and transport workers: in the same paper J.T.Murphy urges that the trade union machine must be&quot;driven into action&quot;in order to achieve the &quot;United Front&quot;: &quot;Let the masses therefore march to tho head-quarters of the trade union leaders in every town to compel them to toe the line for the United Front against the Capital-1st Class.&quot; Socialist/THE YOUNG COIiHUNIST LEAGUE. jWilliam Carroll, the general secretary of this league has recently reported that the next issue of &quot;The Young Communist&quot; oanaot &quot;be printed &quot;until every penny of previous issues is clear&quot; and that the forty-six &quot;branches are only paying a very small percentage of their dues,     Gilbert has been removed from the pay-roll and Carroll is endeavouring to &quot;get Mm sent over to the other side as translator for the Bureau&quot;.

The question of contributions will also be considered as will, the memorandum from the General Council of the Trades Union Congress whioh asks for tho powers necessary to make joint defence against any attack on trade union standards:   the suggested powers include the right to levy affiliated unions,A.J.Cook, the former Communist member of the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain executive stated in a recent issue of the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; that as the American owners had said that the miners1 wages must be reduced in order to meet oompe-tition from the British Coalfields, especially from Wales, his executive had asked tho American miners how it could assist them because, &quot;if they aro defeated, it will mean a further ren duction in wages and conditions to the Welsh miners&quot;.MAHIFESTO OF THE &quot;EGYPTIAN WORKERS&apos; PAB.gr1.The current issue of the &quot;Conriunist Review&quot; contains a&quot;Manifesto of the Egyptian Workers1 Party to the Workers ofthe World&quot;:   the following extracts which are in accordancewith the declared policy of the British Communist Party are taken from this document.&quot;The Egyptian Workers&quot; party, standard-bearer of the proletariat and party of the olass struggle, de-clares that in the Union of the entire Egyptian people in its supreme fight against the oppressive power of British Imperialism it will integrally maintain its Socialist programme and will not renounce its struggle against the Egyptian capitalist tyrants and oppressors, acoomplices and associates of the tyrannic foreign domination....&quot;The Egyptian proletariat, workers and peasants, ex-tends a fraternal hand to the world proletariat andparticularly/
particularly to the proletariat of Great Britain, bo that together they may mount to the assault of the imperialist citadel, ^ihich under its weight suffocates not only the enslaved, peoples of the Orient, hut also pitilessly exploits all the lahouring. and producing masses of Europe,   The peopleB of the Orient count on the assistance and support of the world proletariat in their struggle against the common enemy,&quot;She struggle for the oonquest of Independence on the part of the peoples of the Orient Is also a struggle hearing a dear Socialist oharaoter.     The world pro-   i letariat is enslaved and exploited by the same enemy -rapacious capitalism.&quot;Let the diplomats plot and intrigue and betray the interests of the masses.   We, the proletariat, are ready for a long and bitter struggle, are forming our battle lines, are organising our forces in the Trade Unions and are bringing together the workerB of the city and country.     Let the intellectuals go to the peasants to create a united political and eoonomio front, which will at the same time act as a counter balanoe to the influence of the bourgeoisie.&quot;Without hesitation, and without fear, let us group ourselves around the banner of the International for the final struggle against our only enemy, British Imperialism, which is, today the highest expression of world capitalism.   On the victory of Socialism and on the seiaure of power by the proletariat depends the independence and emancipation of the peoples of the Orient.   And by the indissoluble union of tho workers of the West and of the East, we will vanquish our oonraon enemy - capitalist imperialism.&quot;LONG LING INDEPENDENT EGYPTI     LONG LIVE THE INTERNATIONAL OP THE WORKERS!

The republic-cana were anxious for a decision but were afraid to foroe the issue, and although outwardly their work is held up, behind . the scenes they are still aotive in recruiting for the Re-publican I.R.A. and quietly organising their forces with a view to another attempt to capture the position.The really active spirits are devoting their attention to acquiring arms and ammunition for their party in Ireland. The North of England and Scotland are the chief resorts of those arms agents.     One of them B.O,Dalaigh of Liverpool, whose activities were reported in October last in connection with the prosecution of Joseph Connolly and other officials in the Irish Self-Determination League for stealing explosives, etc in Neath, Merthyr Tydvil, Cardiff, Liverpool and New-oastle, has again oomo under notice.

There has been considerable Irish Republican Army activity in Sootland during the week.     Delegates from vario companies met at the Bam&quot;ba Ball, Maryhill Road, Glasgow on tho 5th April and after muoh discussion it was decided not to send a delegato to the adjourned I.R.A. Convention in Dublin,The extreme section has   great hopes of capturing the I.R.A. throughout Scotland, but there is much diversity of opinion on the question of supporting the Free State and the rank and file may be said not yet to have taken sidos definit ly.Rumours have been prevalent throughout England that the extremist section of the Republican Army is contemplat- , ing a big ooup to depose the Free State Government during the Easter holidays.
