[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majestys Government.]SECRET.CP. 3936.THE CABINET.THE SOMALILAND DISTURBANCES.I CIRCULATE a series of telegrams dealing with a recent disturbance in Somaliland and the successful Air Force demonstration by which order was restored.w. s. c.Colonial Office, April 11, 1922.No. 1.Paraphrase Telegram from the Governor of Somaliland Protectorate to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, dated 25th February.(Received Colonial Office 12*20 i\m. 26th February, 1922.)February 25. I deeply regret to report that during affray at Burao yesterday between Rersegulleh and Akils of other tribes Captain Gibb was shot dead. Having called out camel corps company to quell disturbance he went forward himself with his interpreter, whereupon fire was opened on him by some Rersegulleh riflemen and he was instantly killed. Shooting lasted for about ten minutes, and Gibb was only casualty. Miscreants then disappeared under cover of darkness, which was falling. Tumble is strictly localised, and it is most unlikely that it can spread beyond three sections of Habr Yunis, other people being with us Am waiting arrival of Finder before determining necessary action, and will telegraph again later. Archer.9715/1922. No. 2.Paraphrase Telegram from, the Governor of Somaliland Protectorate to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, dated 27th February.(Received Colonial Office 910 a.m. 28th February, 1922.)February 27. In order to meet situation created by murder of Gibb require two aeroplanes for about fourteen clays. I have arranged with Resident, Aden, for these, and have to-day made formal application, which please confirm. It is proposed they fly via Perim, confining sea crossing to .12 miles. Propose to inflict tine of 2,500 camels on implicated sections, who are practically isolated; and at same time demand surrender of man who killed Gibb.He is known. Fine to be doubled in event of failure to comply with latter condition and aeroplanes used to bomb stock on grazing grounds. General situation is entirely satisfactory one, indication being that twenty-eight Akils of Hargaisa district have already collected their riflemen and come forward with offer of assistance, anticipating possible spread of 1 rouble to Habr Yunis generally.No further assistance will be required, T. hope you will sanction at an early date maintenance permanently two aeroplanes in Somaliland Protectorate as recommended in my memorandum, as 1 believe that this is absolutely essential and only solution of Mijertein difficulty, as to which no agreement with Italians was reached. Chance of failure to inflict prompt punishment necessary in this instance is that sections concerned will get away into Gorahai before we can strike, and rainy season is now[8241] bPrinted for the Cabinet.   April 1922.
breaking, which is unfavourable. But I hope that this will not be case, as two Akils and three of section most implicated have surrendered voluntarily. Full report by post in clue course. Archer.No. 3.Paraphrase Telegram from the Gocernor of Somaliland Protectorate to the Secretary of State for the Colonies.(Received Colonial Office 6*35 i\m. 2nd March, 1922.)-March 2. Two aeroplanes arrived Berbera to-day. All Habr Yunis elders are reported on their way in and arriving to-morrow to receive Government order, and outlook now is entirely favourable. No movement has been attempted far south.  Archer.&apos;No. 4.Paraphrase Telegram from the Gocernor of Somaliland Protectorate to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, dated 3rd March.(Received Colonial Office 7&apos;30 p.m. 3rd March, 1922.)March 3. It is reported that Dolbahanta have looted dump at Ainabo under irregulars, in which were 12,000 rounds of ammunition and twenty-six rides, intended for distribution to them for protection against Mijertein. If report is true a favourable situation has been complicated. I fear that report is correct, and if so; it will hearten disaffected Habr Yunis sections. It rules out also contemplated employment of camel corps at Garero with Dolbahanta as a potential enemy in their vicinity. Moreover, on the evening Gibb was killed B Company proved unreliable at Burao, being unwilling to fire into body of riflemen implicated, thus paralysing prompt action, which might have settled matter on the spot. Both Pinrier and J, however, believe that three other companies here and elsewhere are all right.In any case our view is that it is unwise at present moment to take any risks, and I consider time has come when I must ask for one company of British regiment in Aden to be held in readiness to embark immediately if required to garrison Sheikh, on which we could fall back in emergency. There are both motor transport and wireless communications.Aeroplanes are now ready, and their flight this afternoon over Burao will have very steadying effect.I have communicated copy of this telegram to Resident, Aden, and feel that if I have to ask for this further measure of assistance you will confirm my action. You will appreciate that under no circumstances do I contemplate moving British troops beyond Sheikh, where there can. be no chance of their being involved seriously whatever emergency arose.All the country around Burao is quiet. Archer.No. 5.Paraphrase Telegram from the Resident at Aden to the Secretary of Statefor the Colonies.(Received Colonial Office 11-30 i\m. 3rd March, 1922.) No. 147 of 3rd March, .1922.With reference to telegram of 3rd March from Governor of Somaliland Protectorate repeated to me. The 2nd Royal Fusiliers here are only 500 rifles strong, and it is therefore not possible to spare a full strength company/ About the 16th instant the Royal Fusiliers will be relieved by Buffs, when former proceed to England. I have not yet been informed as to the strength of Buffs however. In connection with sudden movement of one company of British infantry 40 miles inland from Berbera without reserve at coast, supply and other questions would of course arise.    The strength of British infantry should not be reduced in view of
present situation here, and any assislaiice now sent from Aden to meet emergency in Somaliland Protectorate could only be Indian infantry.The 2nd-19tli Punjabis could be spared, with approval of Government of India, if grave emergency, such as retirement on Sheikh, is possible, provided a battalion from India is sent immediately to relieve them.Repeated Governor, Somaliland Protectorate ; addressed Secretary of State for Colonies.No. 6.Paraphrase Telegram from the Secretary of State for the Colonies to the Governor of Somaliland Protectorate.(Sent 3&apos;45 p.m. Oth March, 1922.)March 6. Addressed to Governor of Somaliland; repeated to Resident, Aden. Your telegram of 3rd March. See telegrams from Aden, 3rd and 4th March, which were repeated to yon. It is impossible for British troops to be spared from Aden, but a company of 2/19th Punjabis will stand by in Aden to be called on by you direct to Aden. If in the meanwhile you consider extra garrison in Somaliland may be necessary for some time, I am prepared to consider despatch of a company of 6th Kings African Rifles from Dar-es-Salaam to Somaliland. But in any case the company of Punjabis will stand by until 1 hear from you. I presume that Aden will not require replacement of this company from India.No. 7.Paraphrase Telegram from the Governor of Somaliland Protectorate to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, dated 6th March.(Received Colonial Office 5*20 p.-m. 6th March, 1922.)March 6. Effect of aeroplane demonstration on country has been electrical, and it is unlikely now that I shall require troops from Aden as an emergency measure. Akils of all Habr Yunis sections have come in and have undertaken to pay without demur Government line of 3,000 camels. I have given them fourteen days to comply, half of fine to be paid within seven days, and I believe they will make great effort to satisfy this demand. It seems probable also that Dolbahanta will voluntarily restore looted rifles and what ammunition can be recovered. As a matter of fact, it is now clear that Dolbahanta action had no serious political significance, and was not, as I suspected, result of understanding with implicated Rer a in a section of Habr Yunis, but irresponsible action of tribesmen unable to resist chance of loot. Camel corps are moving forward to Garero to-day to complete effect, and I feel that situation is well in hand.At same time, my opinion that a company of British troops should be stationed at Sheikh, if and when practicable, and that two aeroplanes should be kept in the country permanently is in no way altered, but only strengthened by recent events. Indian troops have little moral effect in Somaliland.I have communicated copy of this telegram to Resident, Aden. AkcherNo. 8.Paraphrase Telegram from the Governor of Somaliland Protectorate to the Secretary of State for the Colonies.(Received Colonial Office II-.10 :i.\m. 11th March, 1922.)Addressed Secretary of State for the Colonies; repeated Resident, Aden, 11th March. Your telegram of 6th March. At present, I do not think I shall require Punjabi company as emergency measure, but gratefully note that in case of necessity they are at my disposal.As to future there can no longer be any doubt in my mind that a non-Somali [8241] jj 2
garrison of 150 to 200 infantry is required in Somaliland Protectorate, and 1 consider that they should be either British troops or King&apos;s African Rifles.A strong consideration in favour of British troops is that, while it should be of mutual advantage to Somaliland Protectorate and Aden to post one company of British regiment stationed in Aden at Sheikh, little extra expenditure would presumably be involved by this step when once initial outlay had been covered vide paragraph 10 of combined report of Resident, Aden, and myself of ISfh January. Would this arrange-ment not be possible independently of amalgamation question after arrival of Buffs company temporarily going under canvas at Sheikh? Station ship makes inter-communication rapid and economical.Employment of King&apos;s African Rifles involving maintenance permanently of additional native troops has drawback that it will create heavy recurrent charge which cannot be met by Somaliland Protectorate and falling presumably against, Exchequer, and day when revenue and expenditure can be made to balance will thus be postponed indefinitely. Furthermore, conditions of life in Somaliland Protectorate will not be congenial to East African natives, and comparatively frequent change of detachments necessitating over a ten to fourteen days&apos; sea route will be expensive, particularly if detachment has to be accompanied by their women folk as originally proposed. But for these financial considerations, I agree that employment of King&apos;s African Rifles in Somaliland Protectorate would be entirely satisfactory. Archer,No. 1).Paraphrase Telegram from the Governor of Somaliland Protectorate to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, doted ISth March.(Received Colonial Office 11-15 p.m. 13th March, .1922.)Addressed to Secretary of State for the Colonies.   Copy to Resident, Aden.March 13. Reference to your telegram of .1 1th March ami my telegram of same date. I am satisfied that neither King&apos;s African Rifles nor other troops will be required to deal with the present situation, which has been solved by the threat from the air. (?) under fine imposed are streaming into Burao in great numbers without a shot being fired to date.As to future, I assume you will take a decision on my telegram of 1.1th March, to which I should add that if later British troops can be posted at Sheikh it may be forgotten that they are available to be withdrawn in. case of emergency at Aden.Meanwhile, more pressing than the question of non-Somali garrison is the matter of the permanent retention of two aeroplanes here. Under arrangement with Resident the aeroplanes lent must return to Aden on 22nd March. This provides a very short time for the fulfilment&quot;, in every respect of the conditions imposed on tribesmen, and it will be realised that the departure of aeroplanes deprives me at once of a powerful moral and material factor exercising enormous influence and control over Somalia. Can they be replaced here at an early date from Egypt or Aden flight strengthened to admit of their continued presence in the Somaliland Protectorate ? Nothing else could have produced such rapid and general compliance with Government orders, and as the unit is now constituted their use is thoroughly economical. Special measures adopted to date have not involved additional expenditure exceeding 30UL or 400L, which will be covered many times by proceeds of fine.No. 10.Paraphrase Telegram from the Governor of Somaliland Protectorate to the Secretary of State for the Colonies.(Received Colonial Office 3&apos;54 .i\m. 14th March, 1922.)March 14. My telegram of yesterday, in which I reported that aeroplanes will be required to return to Aden on 22nd March. Flying officers assured me that the flight from Berbera to Aden can be accomplished without any undue risk, as there is only 12 miles sea, and rest of journey is along sea-shore, more favourable to forced lauding, if necessary, than most of route. Possibly Air Ministry do not appreciate that there is an excellent aerodrome at Zeyla, so journey can be taken in three stages : Berbera
to Zela, to Perim, to Aden. They landed on outward journey at Jibuti, where they had most cordial reception from French.In these circumstances I propose to agree to aeroplanes being flown back, unless you telegraph it, is contrary to Air Ministry&apos;s wishes. Addressed Secretary of State for the Colonies ; repeated Resident, Aden. Archer.12287. No. 11.Paraphrase Telegram from the Secretary of State for the Colonies to the Governor of Somaliland Protectorate and the Resident at Aden.(Sent 3-45 i\m. loth March, 1922.)March 15. Addressed Governor, Somaliland; repeated Resident, Aden. With reference to your telegram of 13th March. As regards immediate arrangements, Air Ministry have instructed Egypt to send two aeroplanes to Aden to replace those sent to Berbera and you may therefore, until further notice, retain the two aeroplanes in Somaliland.As regards future arrangements, your proposals as to British army garrison at Sheikh and as to a permanent Somaliland air base are under consideration, and I will communicate further later.No. 12.Paraphrase Telegram from tlie Governor of Somaliland Protectorate to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, dated 25th March.(Received Colonial Office 12*35 p.m. 26th March, 1922.)March 25. Position here is developing entirely satisfactorily. Tribe&apos;s people are frightened and thoroughly in hand, and there is no sign of opposition in any quarter.Of fine of 3,009 camels finally imposed, about 2,200 have been surrendered at Burao by Akils to date without any punitive action or a shot being fired by troops or aeroplanes, except in the original demonstration at the burning of Burao town after townpeople had been ordered to evacuate. One section of Rer Ainashe has surrendered 450 camels, and another 200 of 250 ordered. Fine will obviously be completed in a few days.Only one of live ringleaders wanted has been caught, but this will take time. It is realised that the surest way to effect capture is to mark them clown and arrest them ourselves.   With this end in view, names have not been divulged.The Dolbahanta have restored 20 of the 30 rifles and about 7,000 or 8,000 rounds of 12,000 rounds ammunition looted. Imposition of a moderate fine will settle this matter.There is no further need for anxiety, and I am letting Maclaren return 28th March to Aden, but I do not think that time has come to strip wings off aeroplanes as directed from Cairo, and I am keeping one ready to use in case it might be required.  Archer.No. 13.Paraphrase Telegram from the Governor of Somaliland Protectorate to the Secretary of State for the Colonies.(Received Colonial Office 4*5 a.m. 28th March, 1922.)March 27. Total cost of employment of two aeroplanes in Somaliland Protectorate for month of March is , 500 including pay and rations of officers and other ranks, all oil, petrol, ammunition, stores, transport, including one special sailing of Cowasjee&apos;s boat. Actual experience proves that two aeroplanes can be maintained in commission with staff of two officers aud five other ranks, not nine as shown in MacLaren&apos;s estimate submitted with my confidential memorandum of 18th January.Annual recurrent charge should thus be less than the  5,500 estimated. Archer.
