The reason for the commandeering of a. large number of lorries in CORK about this date is now explained.     As far as can be at present ascertained,.  a man called T.B. Barrv, a dangerous Republican extremist-.(recently liaison officer at CORK) was in command of the enterprise on land, while Capt. Collins (Cork Harbour Board) was Navigation Officer and had command of the tug.     The number of arms captured has not yet been definitely ascertained,4. .   A state of tension still exists on the Border between the Six-Counties and Southern Ireland, and it remains to.be seen if the leaders of the Provisional Government can enforce their authority *md control their adherents both on the Border itself and withinthe Six&quot; Counties In accordance with -the Peace/Arrangement

to be bound &quot;by the terms of the Peace arrived at in LOII001&quot; last   eex.   A captured I ..H,A.. order dated 26th Llaroh is attached- (Appendix IV) and shows that the. responsibility for several outrages within the si:; countries lies with the I ,E,A. authorities.5.

Pour firms in the centre of the City have had large premises gutted within the week.    These firms are all Protes-tant and it is difficult to believe that the I.R.A. are not responsible for these fires.    Cases have-&apos; also -occurred of individual houses being burnt, the owners of these have- been Roman Catholics.6.      Trains leaving the Six Counties have-been held up on-several occasions, and BELFAST goods removed and destroyed.&apos;--Throughout Southern Ireland, the Boycott is being enforced with grea-&apos;-&amp;.&quot; rigour than ever before, as the result of one of the resolutions carried at the Convention on 26th March. -Appendix I -shows the damage done in a-single week..,&apos;-&apos; in DU3LI1T, public ITotiees .have appeared&apos; in the Press,, forbidding all sale of BELFAST goods after 2nd April without a special permit to be granted by &apos; the &quot;&quot;Director of.

The following incident shov/sg its degree, : - - &apos;:&apos; ,- &quot;Two men in the uniform of the Irish Army were walking along the street when one of their officers, in uniform, passed them.   The men took no notice of.him, so he turned and ashed them why they.did not salute him,,    They told him that they had got. something better -to do than to salute a damned fool like.him.    The&apos; Officer remonstrated and said that they must always salute their officers, and that he had a good mind to place them both under arrest.    They told him they did not give a damn for him and he could go -to -HSLL. - The Officer then asked the.men not to&apos; worry and to come and have a drink.&quot;. \-A press/- 4 V .

IX/1046. i^&quot;^1 APPENDIX    lit1.     It ia worthy of note that there are now exceptionally few persons in Minister who call themselves &quot;Free Staters&quot;. The most moderate of them now call themselves &quot;Republicans&quot; arid they refer to the otheis as &quot;Super Republicans&quot;.     Their line of argument being that they will get their Republic In due course, through the Free State, whereas the &quot;Super Republicans&quot; want it now,Z*     It is now perfectly clear that Collins has lost a great deal of support during the past few months,     In fact he has hardly any left in this area, and it appears that his followers stand no earthly chance of being returned at the forthcoming elections.     Intimidation Is one reason for this and the second is that there is a feeling that, now the I.R.A. in the South are practically united in supporting De Valera, Collins cannot deliver the goods.     At the present moment the Republlo is the only authority which carries any weight in Cork&apos;; Kerry, Limerick, Tlpperary,l?est Waierford and Kilkenny.     Clare, led by Michael Brennan, was fairly strong in support of Collins until recently, but now thev are wavering, and Brennan himself has lost faith in the Free State and calls himself a Republican. ,   The probable result of this impasse appears to be a Republic functioning in the South or Civil War,     The latter is, hbwover, unlikely because there is no one to light against De Valevars followers,3.     There is an electric feeling in the air as if something big was about to happen,  That It i^/impossible to define- at the moment, but some Officers in the South of Ireland who have been moving about fairly freely have been warned by friendly civilians to exercise more caution.     None of these civilians have been able to give.any reasons for their warnings.     The situation Is very tense at the moment, and it is possible that there will be something doing before very long.4,     The Labour element is giving a certain amount of trouble and is gaining strength and appears to be Joining hands with the Republicans.5.     To sum up the situation in mnster.     The vast majority of the inhabitants of the country west of a line drawn North and South of Kilkenny l^own and South of the River Shannon, are strongly in favour of De Valera end his party.     The reason for this is the knowledge that the I*R.A. are almost entirely in fevo\ir of the extremist Republicans.     In Co. Clare both the I.R.A. and the civil population appear to be almost equally divided, half for Collins and half for De Valera..    This change in favour of the Republicans has occurred within the last month..     Michael Brennan/Commandant lst.Viestorn Division, is reported to have stated that there: are only 500 men in his Division who will pledge, themselves, not to take part in any campaign against the Provisional Government.     He recently gave the strength of his Division as 15,000 all rfnks.     This would include conscripts.
Subject:- Parade of Dublin Brigade Mutineers.Yesterday, 2nd. iu?t. the I.R.A. Executive ordered a moblli-zation of the men of the Dublin Brigade I.R.A, who vj shad to re-affirm their allegiance to the Republic&apos;.     The loyal I. ft. A., G.H.Q. issued a earning to all ranks, ordering the?&apos;&apos;; not to attend. The 5 Bavons. of the City &quot;Brigade paraded:as follows:-No. I Battalion: Assembled at Parnell Sq. at 15,00. hrs.    520 menparaded including 34 officers.     Only a small proportion carried arms openly,  (about 30), but about 50;- had arms concealed In their coats.No. 2 Battalion: This Battalion paraded at MOUNTJOY SQ. at 15.00 * &apos;&quot;&apos;&apos; hrs,     Tnere were seven companies each averaging40 men,  with Battalion H.Q.

About 120 men carried revolvers on their belts and a great many men carried revolvers in their pockets.

About 30 carriedrevolvers&apos;on their belts.NOTE.. &apos; The above figures, can be taken as accurate v ithin1% error, as each Battalion was carefully counted several times by a different person.DISCIPLINE. The men marched well but the general disciplinewas bad.     when halted the men sucked oranges in the ranks and threw the pips at their officers viho threw orange peel back at the men.BRIGADE PARADE.      The whole Brigade assembled at SMITHFIELD at 16.00hrs. where they oere addressed by Commandants OSCAR TEAYNER, ANDRE?/ MCDONNELL, HOLOHAN (1st. Battn), 0&apos;CONNOR (3rd, Battn), .LIAM MELLOnES and others.The speeches were very long winded and were for the most part inaudible.     The following points were of interest:-&quot;A number of men from BEGGARS BUSH and the Bank of Ireland have come over to our side&quot;.&quot;If there is Civil War the Free State will be responsible,     The Dublin. Brigade will, have to bear&apos;the brunt of re-establishing the Republic1&apos;. .
&quot;The GJI.Q. at BEGGARS BUSH have dismantled all our old bombr-factories, tc try and cripple us, ,but we.are- not worried. The Cork Republicans have set you&apos;a. splendid example by stealing a trawler full of arms, etc. frcm the British&quot;,...&quot;Iiow can there;be Civil flar.;     The Free State have no Army. Practically the whole of the I.R.A, are on our side.&quot;The only people we may have&apos; to ,fight are the British Troops left in the Country&quot;.GEKERAL.The- Brigade afterwards marched to SACKVILLE ST. where they were dismissed.     The men were very tired, several fainted. There were about 100 men not belonging to any Battalions who ^-removed about in motor cars:or on bicycles^     The press report that the number on parade was 3,200.The number must have included the Cumann-na-Bann ( 7 Coys, total. 250,, including the University Coy. under Dr. Kathleen LYNN) and 7 or 8 coys, of Fianna..     Since the 6th B-attn. has&apos; been transferred to the South Dublin Brigade the total strength of the City Brigade is&apos;.about 3,500, therefore the men on parade represented about 75$ of the Brigade.      O.C. lst,Bn. states his Battalion numbered over 1,000 and only 20 were not-for a Republic,., although a large number of his Republicans were not on /parade. .SOUTH DUBLIN PARADE..   This Brigade paraded in the morning for the same purpose( No details are at hand except that at KINGSTOWN a- number of men fell out saying they would only.serve the G.H.Q, at BEGGARS BUSH.
