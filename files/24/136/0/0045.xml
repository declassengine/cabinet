THE OOIflltlNISTSUJhe. !2hird International recently decided that the period of waiting and preparing for,the &quot;world&apos;revolution&quot; had come to an end and that more active measures were essential: instructions have accordingly boen issued to all commxuiist parties and .nuclei in Western Europe to reoeminence &quot;the most intensive agitation&quot; and there is reason to believe that these orders apply particularly, as far as England is concern-ed, to the present industrial crisis.The Communist Party Commission, meanwhile, is thoroughly investigating the organisation of the Party and has already submitted recommendations of a very drastic character.   Divi-sional organisers have been asked to set up machinery to assist the Commission, which intends to send out a questionnaire this week.     !Rie organisers have been asked to furnish financial statements and &quot;names and addresses of active members in the different localities who may be of assistance to the Commission or play a useful role in their district or in some special activity in the subsequent organisation of the Party&quot;.     There is evidence that the present officials of the Party are loath to incur any fresh responsibilities lest their decisions be overruled by the Commission..,Lenin, according to a recent article in &quot;Pravda&quot; doesnot/
not appear to approve of the &quot;concessions&quot; made by Radek an Bukharin at the recent Berlin conference of the three Inter, nationals particularly in regard to their promise that the Soviet Government would not apply capital punishment to the Social Revolutionaries and would permit representatives of the Internationals to be present at the trial:   he considers!that the &quot;bourgeois diplomatists proved smarter than our ovmbut that the Berlin agreement must not ,rbe&apos; torn up&quot;.     lie nisiconcluded his artiole,&quot;The Berlin lesson teaches us the following: The Vienna and London Internationals want a. United FroiB because they hope to weaken us through our excessive desire for conciliation, and to use the United Front to make the workers think that Reformist taotios are correct. . .......&quot;We want a&apos; Unite&apos;d Front because wo hope to con-     I vinee the workers to the contrary; &apos;  To&apos;help the worker to understand the artful mechanism of two fronts in the&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot; worldTs economics and politios, we accepted the United Front tactic and will see it through.&quot; ^Zinoviev, according to a speech reported last week by tho &quot;Daily Herald&quot;, is of the same opinion regarding the i i necessity for a united front: he said that although previoJ splits had proved harmful to communists they were necessaryfe to draw out from the Socialist parties the best revolutional) elements, and constitute them a Communist advance guard. Hoj the moment had arrived when the masses must be shewn that ,, the Communists had only split off in order the better to re unite the movement. The policy of the United Front was not a counsel of despair. It was the&apos;product of the rising tide of revolution.&quot;The Communist&quot; oontinues to devote considerable space to the engineering dispute and is doing its best to bring o the 47 unions: while the Party&apos;s attempts to widon the ares of the dispute have, hitherto failed their efforts to prevent&quot;scab&quot;/
?7K*&quot;scab&quot; labour have had some effect:   the Chief Constable of Dumbarton, for instance, informs me that on April 11th David Kirkwood addresse-d a meeting in tho Burgh He.ll in connection-   with the resumption of work at William Denny Brothers by two men named Thomas MoMurdo and William Jack.   A crowd of between&apos;. two and three thousand communists and Irish extremistsjostled and hissed these two men when they left work and on the following day a crowd of similar size mis-handled them to euoh an extent that they were subsequently unable to work. The leaders of the mob, one of whom was a Justice of the Peace-,&apos; have beon&apos; reported by tho Chief Constable to the Pro-curator Piscal under the Conspiracy and Protection of Proper-ty Act 1075.In Barrow.also extremists are active in connection with the dispute and it is reported that a sequence &apos;of Vigilance Committees is being organised by J.T. Murphy from Sheffield.There is reason to.believe that communists generally have been instructed to work, unobtrusively at the moment lest their activities prejudice the Russian cause at Geneva.The Publications Department.of the Communist Party is offering branches sets of seven translated Russian and German revolutionary publications at 2/6:    these books were originally sold at a total cost of about 9/-.THE YOUHG OOIvILIUNIST&apos; LB AGUE.The Berlin Bureau of the.Young Communist League hassent to this country a manifesto &quot;Rouse for Mayday&quot; which isaddressed to the &quot;Young Workers of all countries&apos;&apos;.     The .following extracts are taken from this document.&quot;Despite all talk and promises about diearmament and peace, the militarist armaments .of -the capitalist powers assume ever growing proportions, and the bloody..phantom/
phantom of new imperialistic wars arises hefore the working class. 4&quot;In this struggle for life &quot;between Capital and Labour, the working youth, which has the same interests at stake as the whole working class, must take part be cause the attacks are mostly aimed against them.    It ie the youth which must bring the most resented sacrifices to militarism the youth is    one oannon     fodder for cap ism.   The youth is in the worst economic condition. And capitalism tries hard to bring tho working youth contrast to the interests of the wholo working class by exploiting their weakness and making them to scabs ag&amp;jj the adult workers.&quot;2he Y.C.I. appeals to all young workers for a united struggle against the tricks of capitalism and to form the united battled front of young and adult labour to struggle together for their demands within the rank and file of the whole working class.&quot;%b.e answer to the efforts to introduce overtime must he&quot; the struggle for the defenoe of the e igTrT&apos;bj?u*r day and t&amp;e struggle for the si &apos;hour day?&apos; &quot;&quot;Fight resolutely against all wage outs and for minimum wages which guarantee the minimum of existence! Against capitalism that wants to benefit&quot;of &apos;your we^kr^&quot;Fight against capitalistic militarism and against new warsi&quot;In ordor to bring about the victory of all demand! demonstrate on May first together with the whole prole-tariat.     Make the slogans ox the Communist tnternatioiw and the Young Communist International      the slogans oft the masses of young workers of all lands:&quot;General Down Tools on May first&quot;The Conference of Socialist Sunday Schools held at Gateshead this week-end decided by a large majority not to affiliate with the Young Communist League, but resolved that as the Communist Party had recently severed its connection with the Socialist Sunday Schools movement, party members al ready in the movement should be elected as delegates to oonf with the Communist Party on its attitude and report to the National Council.
Last week the special delegate conference of the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain accepted the recommendations of the Executive Committee regarding the proposed alterations in rules with very little amendment: the existing rule requiring a two-thirds majority for the declaration of a strike therefore stands and the conference decided to recommend districts to oppose the memorandum from the General Council of the Trades UnioniCongress, to which reference was made in my last report: the general feeling was that no steps should&apos; be taken which would interfere with the autonomy of affiliated unions. The oonferenoe agreed to a proposal that the joint labour movement take over the control and ownership of the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; and its allied printing works and further agreed th a levy of ^d- per quarter .should be made on members of the Federation for this purpose.Hat. Watkins, who has recently been in Russia, visited F. Hodges on April 11th and handed over an official application from the All Russian Miners to the Miners&apos; Federation of Great Britain to send a representative to a conference in May:   Hodges promised to consider the matter.IABOOB COBjgEgaeggmum in.   . -    i   i m mnat   ---. - mi    i      has in previous years Easter witnessed a number of labour and trade union congresses:    the Independent Labour Party and the National Union of Journalists met in Nottingham and it is hoped that full Information regarding the former will be available for next week&apos;s report: it may, however, be mentioned now that the Independent Labour Party rejected a resolution advising the LabourParty/

Shop assistants, Warehousemen urtdClerks in London:   the National Union of Enginemen inLeicester, the Engineering and Shipbuilding Draughtsmenin Leeds and the National Union of Teachers in Torquay:most of these conferences dealt with industrial matters.The University Socialist Federation celebrated itstenth &quot;birthday in conference at Caister-on-Sea holiday cdelegates from Oxford, Cambridge, London, Manchester,Cardiff, Reading and Leeds colleges were-present:,.

SernerSecretary: . G.A. HuttInternational Secretary:   E. UnwinTHE &quot;DAILY HERALD&quot;On April 12th Norman Ewer, the foreign editor ef till&quot;Daily Herald&quot;, sent the following instructive letterto Philips Price:&quot;You will have had from George, a letter thanking you for the  200.    I needh&apos;t tell you howl much everybody here appreciated it.   The staff hewjj has been perfectly wonderful, levying itself heavy I&quot; sums all round and - perhaps even more important t!$i that - keeping a wonderful morale and never getting the least rattled, even when things were quite at their wor3t.   Now, at any rate as regards the temporary difficulty, we can see daylight, and, provided that we do not get the sudden and quite unfdrseen shock of the unions refusing to accept finanoial responsibility, we are practically safe he able to carry over until the actual moment oem^&quot;The replies have all got to he in within a few days now, and this time next week we ought to know our fate quite definitely....  . &quot;Of/I
&quot;Of course, what the internal consequences of the transfer are going to be, we still don&apos;-t know at all.    There is simply no sign of any kind.   The storm may break suddenly, it may break slowly - and may not break at all.   So we simply wait and see.   We cannot do anything else.&quot;It is reported that debenture holders in the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; are being asked to forego or re-invest the Interest due to them:   the London Co-operative Society, however, which has invested  500 is pressing for its interest which is required for members&quot; dividends.The paper&apos;s special fund had realised  5,301 on April 12th.&quot;THE WORKER&quot;J.R. Campbell, who has recently been in London, has stated that the possibility of incorporating &quot;All Power&quot;, the organ of the British Bureau of the Red International of Labour Unions in &quot;The Worker&quot; is under consideration.IRI-jK-HSVOLUTIQgARY ^OTTVITIgS IE ORE^T BRITAIN .On April 16th while the usual weekly meeting of the Lewishem Branch of the Irish Self-Determination League was in progress a party of young men of about twelve in number, and all armed, entered.    They were led by one Gerratty, about 22 year^ of age, the local Irish Republican Army Commandant who is said to have been responsible for many of the Outrages committed in the South Eastern district of London about a year ago, and held up the meeting for the purposes of removing a young man who for some reason or other was objectionable to them.   Shots were fired and a general sauve qui peut followed.     None-of those present gave info filiation tp the police for fear of the consequences, being apparently terrorised by this gang of young blackguard A meeting of the Roger Casement Sinn Fein Club was held at 84, Blackfriars Road, on the 12th April with Art 0&apos;Brien:-&apos;      -   V&apos; &apos; - &apos; &apos;..        - . -       m/

P.D. 0&apos;Harte announced that he hud the permission of the Committee of the Club to collect money for de Valera.    Shis matter had been discussed some time ago but owing to opposition from M. Maloney, Dick Murray of Chiswick and Pinton Murphy, it was turned down.   , 0THarte said he had already received some contributions anti added that there are men ready and willing to take up arms again.      Jack McCrath objected to the Committee authorising 0&apos;Harte to collect money and he also objected to 0&apos;Harte speaking in the name of the Irish Republican Army or saying what they are willing to do.   He was sick of all this talk about arms, bombs, etc., and wished the people would sottle down to work.In Scotland the Irish Republican Army continue to be active.    Joseph Robinson who went to the Dublin Convention,, held on the 9th April, in obedience to Rory 0&apos;Connor&apos;s orders, has returned to Glasgov; and was due to go to Fife on the 15th to address the officers of the 4th Battalion Irish Republican army, which is said to be the strongest and most up to date in Scotland.
