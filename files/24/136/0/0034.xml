The &quot;Daily Herald&quot; is reported to have received  500 from Mosoow for printing Trotzkyrs articles.
Tx.5 uVBtegjiOYSSOn March 27th the wholly unemployed on the live re-gisters n iamb * red approximately 1,739,764, a decrease of 22,312 in the week, and. of Govt-r 195,000 in the last eleven weeks: on the same date short time workers numbered 223,000: those figures do not, include the men unemployed through the present industrial disputes. - ,During th6 - week the-unemployed have divided their at-tention between the elections for boards of Guardians and the engineering-dispute: as-far as can be ascertained from results so far received unemployed candidates scored very few successes and the Chief Constable of Plymouth informs me that they were at the bottom of tho polls. .   The efforts to make common cause between the engineers and the unemploy-.-      ed have also proved a fiasco in most districts., . .... *Plans are, being made to hold a-meeting of the National.-        .. ,.&apos;  : ; ipx.-&apos;?   &apos; &quot;it.&apos;, -L y..       &apos;- v&apos;--- :i     /* I-&apos;    i ^ - &apos;.:Administrative.

TEE COMMUNISTSIt is reported that on February 1st   the &quot;Instructor^ Department for Propaganda&quot; attached to the Third Inter-national sent out a number of agents who were to he attach-ed to Russian political representatives, or   in countries where these do not exist, to party oommittees or germ cells: these agents are controlled by the executive oommittee of the Third International and it is believed that 26 were al-located to Great Britain.She financial difficulties of the British CommunistParty are, if anything, increasing, and on March 30th thefoHewing circular was sent to all divisional organisers:&quot;You will remember the conversation we had li. th you following the Policy Conference with regard to the general financial situation ef the Party resulting from the falling off of dues consequent upon the increased unemployment of our members.&quot;She situation is becoming gradually worse and it has been found necessary to make drastic cuts and changes in all departments including that of organisa-tion.&quot;It is becoming more and more essential that our aim must he to make Divisional Councils self-support-ing.     Per the moment we are in a position to hold ourselves responsible for the salaries of the division-al organisers and to make some small contributions towards the expenses involved in divisional council administrations, bit we are quite unable to meet all the present expenses involved in your division.&quot;It is recognised that there are Divisions whioh are exceptionally hard-placed and of course special consideration will he shown here, even so, an immedi-ate 50 per cent reduction is essential on the last two months1, averages of weekly expenses.&quot;It should be your immediate task to bring these matters before the divisional-oeunoil, and for you te devise ways and moans for raising the necessary finance in order to meet current expenses.&quot;We should he glad to have as soon as possiblesome/
some Indication from you as to what scheme you propose to put into operation to effeot this.&quot;During the week the oonrnunists have devoted special attention to the elections for Boards of Guardians hut their candidates have failed signally:   in cloventry, for in-stance, communists were at the bottom of the poll in each ward, Dingley receiving only, 498 votes in the Stoke ward out of a total of 7,487.There is still some activity in connection with the Russian Famine Fund.     Edgar Whitehead is leaving for Berlin where he intends on April 8th to meet Willie Munsenberg, of the Central Committee:   MUnzenberg returned from Moscow on March 25th and has informed Whitehead that the chief object of their meeting is to discuss the best means of linking up Famine Relief sxd assistance for agriculture.     In this con-nection interest attaches to a circular sent out on March 27th by Edgar Whitehead from whioh the following extracts are taken:&quot;We have received a radio from Mosoow and wires from the headquarters of the Workers&quot; International Famine Relief Committee in Berlin to the effect that tho week May 1st * 7th has beon set apart as an INTERNATIONAD 2001 COLLECTING WEEK to help the workers and peasants of the Workers&quot; Soviet Republic of Russia in their battle en the economic front.&quot;Soviet Russia has nearly as great a famine of Jools as she has of Food.   She main struggle of the next year will centre in her effort to rebuild her shattered economic life, shattered by years of war, blockade, Counter Revolution, and of Sabotage.&apos; w2he British Section of the Workers1 International Famine Reliof Committee, has decided te take part in this great international effort.n5The preparatory work to organise such an effort should be commenced without delay, working up to a maximum in the week set apart when speakers will specially dwell on the political importance of international relief work, emphasising the inportanoe of the existence of the Soviet Republic for the working class of the whole world, and shall make a mighty and sincere appeal to all workers to give richly tools during the week from the 1st tothe/
the 7th of May. showing &quot;by deeds their international active solidarity and to demonstrate productive help as a now means to support the Workers&apos; Republic.....&quot;A special schedule of tho tools needed is being prepared and mil be circulated in due course.&quot;The Communist Party intonds to make a house to house collection on behalf of the famine fund by means of circu-laxs which will be called for or can be sent into head-quarters:   there is nothing on &quot;these oirculars to convey to the uninitiated that they emanate frok the Communist Party as they are headed &quot;Workers1 International Famine Relief Committee. British Section, 16, King Street, Covent Garden.&quot;Len Jackson stated at a meeting of the Coventry Branch of the Communist Party that Ex-Colonel Malone was the donor of a cheque for  500, which Jackson saw at communist head-quarters.The &quot;Frauensekretariat der Zpmmunistischen Internationa]is in communication with Helen Crawfurd, who is one of theleaders of the communist movement in this country and onMarch 20th wrote:&quot;Your efforts to gather the communist active women and to instruct them for their task in 1 conferences cr meet legs of functionaries are of the utmost importance and must be extended not only over all lone!on districts3 but also in the &quot;biggest towns of the&apos; whole empire, especially in those places where there are many working, women, with the aim to found everywhere committees for the propaganda among the proletarian wqmexu   We are not quite - sure how natters are arranged in the questions of your appointment as a secretary and of your co-optation Into the executive committee.... We are1 ready to send Bertha Braunthal who speaks English perfectly to stay with you for 3 or 4 weeks in this summer and help you in your work.   We should ask you to write to us, which weeks you would prefer as best&apos; suitable for your work&quot;, within May, June and the first half of July,   Please send us woifl, that we may^ arrange our work accordingly,.  At least we want you,to give us a report - or write, an article - about the. situation of. ithe proletarian women in the great lock-out of the, engineers and how they take part In this hard struggle, whetherthe/
the Trade Unions or the socialist parties do anything to interest and instruct the women about the causes of the lock out. the necessity of their assisting the struggle of their class-oomrades.    In this time, when everywhere those large strikes and outlooks spread on account of the reduction of the wages and the strangling of the eight-hours1 day all the manifesta-tions of the women in such situations are of great im-portanco for us0&quot;In London, at least, this movement is making very little headway: recently Minnie Birch arranged for a committee meeting to he held at Gray&apos;e Inn Road hut only she, Mary Moorhouse and another woman wero present and it decided that the attempt to organise a mass meeting should he abandoned and smaller moetings of women held in districts such as Walthamstow, Edmonton and Peckham.On April 3rd Sylvia Pankhurst stated that a branch of the Fourth International had been formed in Glasgow and that this branch was attempting to foment trouble in the industrial areas hy issuing statements such as &quot;It is proposed to stop out-relief&quot;.At the beginning of this month a responsible and very moderate labour leader stated that the communists were gaining strength and that it was surprising how many sx-service men were Joining their ranks:   it is also reported from another source of     unknown reliability that coranunists are holding drill classes and in this connection it may be added that in Liverpool and Sheffield a communist has been found in unlawful possession of fire-arms.The Chief Constable of Birmingham informs me that Ex-Colonel Malone addressed two meetings in Birmingham on April 2nd: his speeches followed the usual lines.The secret communist.press in scotland has printed 2,500 copies of No. 16 of &quot;The Communist International&quot; and these are now waiting for dispatch to communist branches. &apos;SHE/
THE REVOLUTIONARY ASPECT OP THE INDUSTRIAL DISPUTEThe decision of the 47 engineering unions to re-opendiroot negotiations with the employers has, in the words of fthe &quot;Daily Herald&quot;, broken the &quot;United Front&quot; for which the communists have striven so hard.   Communist speakers havecondemned the attitude of the engineers in rauoh harder terms and scarcely attempt to hide their mortification   and disgustThey have not, however, abandoned their efforts to joinEforces with the engineers end the London amalgamated engineering Union group of the Communist Party has recently 1issued the following circular:&quot;The Printers end The Engineers&apos; Look-out&quot;STOP   THE   POISON   GASAN   APPEAL    TO     THE    PRINTERS&quot;Dear Sirs and Brothers,&quot;Thousands of us, engineers, your fellow Trade Unionists are upon the streets. In a* few. days thousands! of shipyard workers will join us. And without a doubt I ^tf-er sections of workers, seeing clearly the purpose of 1 the bosses, and not to be dishonoured will join us in this fray. We are fighting now for sheer existence. You know it.   Where do you stand?&quot;Frankly, Printer Comrades, you are getting amongstI your fellow Trade Unionists en   unenviable reputation. Be it railway strikes, miners&apos; look-out, or any determined stand against our exploiters, and Fleet Street looses its poison gas upon us with your helpl Facts of the dispute are suppressed, half truths and lies circulated, malicious innuendoes launohed all to mislead the public, to break our morale, and to send us 1 back to our wives and children - beaten.   And each time I we are beaten, Comrados - by you.     As fellqw Trade Unionists you greet us as &quot;brothers&quot;.   Is yours a brother18 act?&quot;Pardon our plain speaking, Comrades, buf we are desperate and we tell you that some of you are pampered I to betray us.   Last May at the Olympia you and your wives were feted by the Boss.   In some grades your pay   I is handsome;   for the Master depends on you.   He relies 1 oh you to enable him to jeer at the unemployed, to whittle away their wretched doles, to thrust them deeper! into the abyss.   He relied on you to help him to strike .1 down the miners;   he relies on you to help him to strike I us down.   He thinks you will betray your class if he ... pets you.   Were it only us and you wished to let us down, we would soy, &quot;do it brothers, and be damned to you&quot;.. But will you help the Boss snatch the bread from I bur children, even for a bribe?&quot;What/
&quot;What is the situation?   We are now meeting the second deliberate attack upon Trade Unionism.   The Engineering and Employers&apos; Federation, In their secret circular, show their hand.    They advise employers not to lock out men who resign from the A.E.U. or/join otlTTr unigns^     Their aim is clear/   They aim.to&quot; crush the A.E.U.&quot;&quot;   That accomplished they will devour other unions piecemeal.   Again we a3k, where do you stand?&quot;In your ranks are some who will always pocket the &quot;thirty pieoe3 of silver&apos;.     They are built that way. You have, too, certain leaders, lions in speech, but sheep in a fight.    These men with an eye to office will one day sell you without compunction.    To such we cannot lower ourselves to- appeal.   But former crises have shown that there are men- amongst you.     Some of you understand your class position will not be bribed or flattered, and will stand by your comrades in the hour of need.    To you then we do appeal - for our wives and kiddies, for ourselves, for Trade Unionism, for the present and future of our class.   Strive not against U3, Comrades, but for us1.CUT     OPE&apos;   THE     POISON     G A Si&quot;The Chief Constable of Barrow-in-Furness informs me that a &quot;Council of Action&quot; has been formed in that town in connection with the disputes:    this body has issued a manifesto which the acting national organiser of the Communist Party has sent to divisional organisers with instructions that communist groups are to get into touch with the.secretary of the council: the following is a copy of this document:&quot;URGENT                         URGENT URGENTA     NATIONAL     RANK______MW_______FILE     CONFERENCE.&quot;Fellow Workers,&quot;The Trade Union Movement and the Workers are on the threshold of a GREAT DISASTER.&apos;    This is the most CRITICAL -tSRIOD in the history of the Workers since the advent of CAPITALISM. .&quot;All the negotiations and efforts to avoid it have collapsed.ALL   IS    IN   THE   MELTING   POT&quot;The Trade Union Leaders are afraid of the issue they do not intend to fight on a United Front and our efforts and resolutions have failed to get a WIPING HEAT to unite the Leaders and the Rank ana File TOGETHER, we we have decided to take the initiative and attempt to convene a NATIONAL RANK AND PILE CONFERENCE with-a view to forming a NATIONAL COUNCIL OP ACTION.&quot;It/
&quot;It 1b imperative and URGENT that we butt in at this juncture to put a stop to this tinkering of our Leaders with the Bosses. The Bosses are determined in their attack on the Workers, these delays and negotiations between the Leaders and Sir Allan Smith ani the Government also the suggestions of FURTHER BALLOTS are all part of the game to BREAK THE SPIRIT Of the RANK AND FILE.&quot;It ia for us now to oonvince the Bosses and the Union Leaders that we can gather strength and by the strength of UNITED ACTION of the Rank and File and by a strong determination to allow neither CONSTITUTIONS or PRESS CAMPAIGNS or any intimidation to make us afraid or weaken us in our purpose, we can transform our apparent weakness into a MIGHTY POWER which will make the Ruling Class glad to come to terms.&quot;EMPLOYED WORKERS:   UNEMPLOYED WORKERS:   LOCKED OUT WORKERS:    and ALL who are suffering from the terrible AFTERMATH of IMPERIALISM.   Unite for action to stop the retreat of the workers and the suicidal polioy of the Union Leaders before we sink into deepeJ depths of misery.&quot;COME SHOULDER TO SHOULDER AND VICTORY IS OURSALL POWER TO THE WORKERSGet in communication with R. Purcell, 67, West View Road,Barrow-in-Furness.Signed on behalf of Committee R. purcell, SecretfTHE RED INTERNATIONAL OF LABOUR UNIONSFrom a statement recently made by the Central Europesi Bureau of the Red International of Labour Unions in Berlin! It is clear that John Strain&apos;s recent visit to that city was in connection with the Woodworkers&apos; Propaganda Committee of the Red International of Labour Unions on whf he represents Great Britain:   part of his expenses was defrayed by the Berlin Bureau.Nat Watkinar has returned to this country from Moscow]THE &quot;DAILY HERALD&quot;*George Lansbury continues to make frenzied appeals i money in each issue of &quot;The Daily Herald&quot;: his present flj is to secure  25,000 in order to,&quot;enatR
&quot;enable us to hand over the concern in such a state, as far as finance is concerned, that whoever was responsible for the future would have a little time to look round.&quot;According to an artiole from lansbury&apos;3 pen in theissue of April 1st, the labour movement may take ever thepaper on April 14th.     On April 4th Lahsbury wrote:&quot;We- have also raised a loan which, in addition to subscriptions we are receiving, will enable us to get through the next few weeks.    For this loan I am personally responsible.     I have   undertaken the -   liability because I am oertain you1 will not let its down, but will continue to send al&amp;ng as much as you possibly can.&quot;Speaking at a meeting in Richmond on Maroh 30thLanabury stated that the present circulation of the paper is 200,000 &quot;which is very satisfactory &quot; ana, probably anexaggeration.ARRESTS ABB 00NVIOTIOM3......., On March 30th Gecrge McKernan was fined  10 for being in possession of a revolver without a Firearms&apos; Certificate a quantity of revolutionary literature was found at his home, although, at the time of his arrest, owing to his supposed change of opinions, he was employed as general organiser of the loyal Liverpool Unemployed Distress Committee.On March 30th arising out of the raid on the .Albany Engineering Works,Camberwell, Harry Hawkins, porter, Longcroft Road, Camberwell, and James Lancaster, surgical instrument maker, Jordan Street, Camberwell, were charged at Lambeth Police Court; with having committed wilful damage and assaulted police officers.   The prisoners, who denied that they took any part in the disturbance, were remanded, bail being refused.The Chief Constable of Coventry informs me that on April 4th at Coventry Police Court ??. Hannington, thenational/
national organiser of the unemployed, was hound over to keep the peace for 6 months in the sum of  25:   at first he refused to he bound over end was informed that in that case he would be required to serve a term of 28 days&apos; imprisonment but after consultation with his comrades he decided to be bound over.On the same day T. Dingley, E.H. Pxeece, W.J. Arden, H. Whiteley and J.R. Heard, members of the organised unemployed appeared at Coventry Police Court on a charge of having participated in a demonstration on   March SOth outside the house of a trade union official named Edward Buckle, who instituted proceedings beoause he had been subjeoted to annoyance from the organised unemployed on account of a remark he had made about them:    the accused refused to be bound over and were consequently sentenced to 14 days&apos; imprisonment.The Chief Constable of Birmingham informs me that W. Brain has been remanded until April 10th.I?J?J REVOLUTIONARY ACTIVITIES 3DB THE TOUTED KINGDOM.    .    .The Irish Self-Determination League Conference, held at the Essex Hall, Strand, on the 1st April was a lively affair.    The English and Welsh branohes were represented by 169 delegates end P.J. Kelly of Liverpool was in the chair. Hugh Lee of   Manchester, moved a resolution that it would be impolitic to make any vital alteration in-the constitution of the league, or /consider any suoh alteration until after the general election in Ireland.    This was seoonded by Councillor Sourr.-of: Poplar, who said that in no case would the members of-his branch take sides.    -They felt that any declaration for or against the Treaty would be attempting to influence the - Irish-people . at. home.   -A resolution framed by the London District. Committee who are mainly, supporters of de Valera pledging the league to work for an Irish Republic was put itopposition,/
opposition, and a very long and heated discussion followed. Ultimately the Manchester resolution was carried by 103 votes to 48, amid scenes of great disorder.For the present at any rate Art 0&apos;Brien&apos;s schemes for turning the League into an extreme Republican organisation in support of de Valera has failed.    He left the meeting very crestfallen and is reported to be consulting his friends as to the advisability of breaking away from the League altogether, and with his supporters form a new organisation.A correspondent who recently visited Liverpool and Manchester says that, in these districts, there is an apparent entente between the extreme Irish and the Communists. The Rev. Vint Laughlana, a Baptist Minister, in Liverpool, is hand-in-glove with both parties and is, our correspondent thinks, a very dangerous man.The meeting on the 29th March, at the   Central Hall,Batb Street, Glasgow, to establish the 0&apos;Donoven Rossa Club,was an absolute failure, apparently the better class Irishithere are fighting shy of the extremists.   William Travers, the communist who has recently been re-admitted to the Sinn Fein organisation, was elected President, with Sarah MacMackin, a school teacher, as secretary and Miss MacKillop as financial secretary.In Scotland Joe Vyze, who appears to have taken the side of the Free State, has himself in turn been superseded in the &quot;Scottish Command&quot; by Joseph Robinson, who was recently released from Penal Servitude. . He is a brother of the notorious Seamus Robinson, Commandant of the 3rd South Tipperary Brigade and a member of the Executive Council of the Revolting Irish Republican Army.   Robinson has appointed Martin Hansen Second in Command, Charles Diamond, Brigade Adjutant, end William Sims, Intelligence Officer.
