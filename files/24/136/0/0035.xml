Memorandum by the Home SeoretaryThe provisions of this Bill are baaed on the reoommendationB of a Departmental Committee which reported in November, 1913,     The Committee consisted of the Sari! of Plymouth (Chairman), Professor James Jfc Dobbie (who was at that time the Principal Government Ghemist), Captain Maurice B, Llcyd (who was an Inspector of Explosives), Mr, H0MK Robinson (who was Deputy Chief Inspector of Faotoriea), Mr* Edwin 0, Saohs (who was Chairman of the Executive of the British Fire Prevention Committee) and Mr,, Ja Ollis (the Chief Officer of the Publio Control Department of the London County Council)Q     Legislation to carry out the Committee&apos;a proposals: was delayed by the war, but temporary provision was made in London and oertain other largo tcwns, namely, Liverpool, Leeds, Eirminghaia and Nottingham under the Defence of the Realm Regulations.     In 1915 the London County Council obtained a a Local Aot on the subject, and In 1921 similar provisions were inserted in theI Liverpool Local Act, but in the other towns nothing ha3 been substituted for the Defence of the Realm Regulation, which has new lapsed.The danger of fire in places in which large quantities of celluloid are stored especially the premises of cinematograph film renters, is serious, and when a fire occurs, the combustion of the celluloid is so fierce and rapid that it is usually attended with loss of life.     Of recent fires the worst was one at Newcastle In 1919 where eleven persons lost their lives.     This fire ocourred in a six storey i building occupied mainly by commercial offices.     The fire originated in the basement occupied by a Film Company, the flames shot up the lift well and cut off the escape of persons in the upper floors.     Numerous representations have been made to me by local authorities as to the need for general legislation.The Gommittee of 1913 reoommended regulations for- (l) factoriesc (2) raw oellu-loid stores, (3) places where cinematograph films are kept, and (4) wholesale shops and warehouses where more than 5 cwt. of celluloid is stored,,Factories where celluloid is handled have already   been dealt with by Regula-tions under the Factory and Workshop Act.In the case of shops and warehouses it would be a matter of great difficulty to frame any regulations which would be workable and could be easily enforced, and it    is questionable whether the dangers connected with these places are so sub-stantially increased by the storing.of celluloid articles aa to constitute a case &apos;-for special legislation.     Special precautions are, no doubt, needed in shops and&apos;  -warehouses where inflammable articles, quch, as flannelette, muslin curtains,Imatches., celluloid combs and the like are stored, bu  the question of the precau-tioxis. to be taken -in - suoh premises is one that should be considered rather from the general point of view of fire prevention and fire esoape than from theo
special point of view of protection from celluloid dangers. A Royal Corn-mission is at present considering the whole question of fire risks and fire losses, and I propose therefore that legislation with regard to shops and warehouses should await the report of this Commission.The places, however, with which this Bill deals, namely, raw celluloid stores and the premises of persons who let out cinematograph films; stand on quite a different footing. &apos; The-celluloid in present in&apos;tnuch larger quanti-ties and under nore dangerous   conditions and the need for the regulation of such premises cannot.be.seriously-contested.The Bill does not deal with cinematograph theatres which are already regulated by the Cinematograph Act of 1909.     The premises at which  he Bill ! is specially. aimed are.those of the agents and renters who supply the films to the&apos; ther.tro:-* and in their capacity of circulating agents store and repair and clean the filjua in the intervals when they are returned from one theatre j and before they are sent out to another, - -       ...      - &quot;The general effect of the Bill may be summarised as follows (l)   The premises to which the Bill applies must be notified to the Looal   &apos; Authority and the Local Authority will have power to inspect them. (2) The Local Authority will be empowered to require reasonable means of escape in oase of fire from the said premises.(3) Suoh premises must he so constructed and situated as to minimise the danger to adjoining premises.(4) Proper precautions as Set out in the schedules must be observed in the workrooms and store places.All these provisions are based on the recommendations of the Departmental Committee.     The provisions under the first three heads will take the place of&apos; a general regulation which was adopted under the Defence of the Realm Act providing that persons should not have celluloid or cinematograph films in their possession without a permit vrom the Chief Officer of Police, and the praotioe of the Polioe Officers was only to &apos; grant permits for places where they were satisfied with the structure and situation from the point of view of fire dangers.     The provisions in the schedules are similar to the regula-tions adopted under the Defence of the Realm Aot and to the provisions in the London A0t.     They are necessarily detailed but I do not think they will present any practical difficulty to the persons affected.Recommendations have been made to me from the Chief Constables of large towns as to the need for legislation.     For example, the Chief Constable of Manchester in November last called attention to the large and increasing stock of cinematograph films in Manchester and said &quot;I think it very desirable that steps should be taken with as little delay as possible to introduce legisla-tion for the purpose cf regulating the storage of this highly inflammable material&quot;.     The Chief Constable of Birmingham, wrote last September as to the need for legislation to continue the regulations under the Defence of the Realm Aot? which had been found of great seryioe &quot;as it enabled us to put our celluloid storage places under proper oontrol and.inspection;    in fact we
effected e revolution with regard to the storage of films, eto........ .&apos;.Ihestorage of celluloid under the conditions we found when we first had D.O.R0A,&apos; &apos; revealed a very serious state of affairs here,&quot;     The Town Clerk of Leeds in ;-j September last forwarded a report from the Chief Constable in tyhioh attention was drawn to.the very serious.risk of. injury to life and property arising from the storage of films without proper oontrol, and said that the watch Committee were of opinion that the power. they, had : exeroised under D..0.R.A4 should be oontinued, - ....It is clear, I think, that the Bill would be supported generally by . Local Authorities and I do not. believe that there will be ;any.serious opposi-tion to it, though no doubt some of the details will be Oriticised in Committee.I ask for authority to bring in the Bill and suggest that it should be introduced in the House of Lords.Several questions were asked in the. House last session as to what stepB would be taken to deal with celluloid dangers and I said I hoped it might be possible to legislate in 1922. &apos;&apos;VE.
