GENOA CONFERENCEREPORT OF BRITISH COMMITTEE ON- THE WORK OF THE MEETINGS OF jgj^jjg^ffjgf-g-jgrTHB MViTIN^&quot;P&quot;OlfERS^(A) General.,. &apos; ?(B) Russian Proposals. .(C) Reconstruction &apos; of Europe.(A)    GENERAL. -&apos;&apos;/,&apos;: &apos;&quot;- ..; &apos;;.&apos;,&apos;/ &apos;. -   .The meeting of British, French, Belgian, Italian and :&apos; Japanese Experts, summoned to exchange views on the proposed Agenda of the Genoa Conference met at the Board of Trade on the morning of Monday, March 20th under the chairmanship of Sir Sydney Chapman^   The Conference sat continuously till the afternoon of Tuesday, March 28th, when the final report attached herewith was adopted. &apos; -It was made clear at the outset that the function of the experts was confined to an exchange of views, which were to be regarded as non-committal and in no sense as oarrying :: government authorisation,.The conference aimed at achieving the greatest common measure of agreement and in view of all the circumstances a satisfactory amount of agreement was reached.   A?*art from the Russian question there was no very marked grouping among the experts, though naturally the different eoonomio situations of the respective oountrles led to certain differences of opinion, as to what, was immediately -feasible and desirable.
(B) RUSSIAN PROPOSALS:.       Although a great measure ofagreement has been reached on th6 Russian problem it must be pointed out that this agreement was only reached &quot;by &quot;reserving&quot; the larger issues on which any marked difference of op inion aro se.As already indicated,, the. purely political questions of de jure recognition and of existing treaties were not discussed at all;   nor, of course, was the question of disarmament raised. But various other political and semi-political questions arose , upon which the attitude of the various exports was pretty clear-ly defined.   Ihe most important of -tfiese points are referred to below.?orm of Conditions.    !Ehe original British proposals had been drafted in the form of Articles of Agreement but the French took exception generally to any discussion on the basis of an asBumed treaty and in particular to considering reciprocity in ,  any way.     One final words adopted in the draft were :n!2he question of the instrument by which effect could be given to these conditions and to contingent provisions hag not been considered, nor the. relation of any such instrument to existing trade agreements with Russia&quot;,ffihus the door was left open on both issues.!Ehe draft now put forward consequently takes the form of conditions under which trade with Russia can be resumed, but broadly speaking it corresponds with the conditions in this respect incorporated in the articles prepared by the British. In some cases a more general phraseology has been adopted in order to leave open certain questions on which there were differences of opinion;   and there are. one or two. matters of importance referred to below on which agreement was not. reached.
&quot;Diy3.a3.on of responsibility for theiRussian Debt. When the debt provisions were referred to the drafting Committee, the French delegate desired the olauses to be so warded that, they would not prevent the assumption by Poland and the other succession states of Russia of a share of the Russian debt-   . The Italian and Japanese Delegates wished to include some reference to the subsidiary Soviet States.      Both these questions were dealt with by the addition of two notes (Vide pages 4 and 5 of the report), but it is expected that the French will press fcr the assumption of a share of the Russian debt by the new statesDebt Commission.   There was a marked difference of opinion between the British arid the Italian representatives on the one side and the French and Belgian on the other, as regards both the functions and the composition of the debt commission.     The experts of the latter Powers desired that the debt commission should, have very wide powers over Russian Government finance which the British and Italian  -experts wished to avoid.   . Ho agreement was reached on this question.     The French supported by the Belgians were at first inclined to think. that the Debt Commission should be composed entirely of the creditor staves, whereas the British and Italian proposal was for equal representation of the creditor states on the one hand and of Russia on the other.     In the end Russian representation was gener-ally accepted but the relative numbers were left undefined.
Security for the debt.     The French and Belgian delegates further wished to give the debt commission power to select particular assets to be assigned as security for the Russian debt whereas the British and Italian Delegates preferred, that the debt should simply be secured on the whole assets&apos; of the Russian State.   &apos; Alternative articles to meet these two points of view were included where necessary in the Annexes.Private debts.   There is another point to which attention should be oalled.     The clause relating to private claims as it now stands requires the claimant to prove (a) that he has suffered loss and (b) that his loss is due to the action, or, negligence of the&apos;Russian Government.   The British draft provided in addition that the Russian Government should pay foreign nationals for goods and services supplied to Russia for &quot;which they had-not been paid (whether the loss was due to the action or negligence of the Russian Government or not) and that foreign governments should assume a corresponding liability.   This repeats a clause in the British; trade agreement.    Mest of the experts.felt a difficulty about the corresponding liability, (though it was laid down in our draft that it could ,be discharged in Russian bonds) and all the foreign, experts objected to the principle of converting private debts into public obligations and were of opinion that substantial justice- would be done without any addition to the clause as it now stands.   &apos;
Decision is needed as to what the British attitude should he at Genoa In view of the clause in our trade agreement.Other ProvisIons*   Clauses were agreed providing for the establishment of a satisfactory system of justice and of civil and criminal courts for the protection of the person and property of foreigners trading in Russia, and for granting necessary trading transport and other facilities *Guarantees for the Transition Period.     The French and Belgian representatives laid great stress upon the necessity for special arrangements to protect the persons, and property of foreigners returning to Russia uvntll such time as the situation there had improved.     The prime epos a Is upon this subject which they put forward have so far as they were adopted be*n incorporated in the draft simply as provisions by which the speedy restoration of Russia would be facilitated, but in the French and Belgian mind some of them are primarily as essential as any of the measures proposed.Other matters.     To the articles relating to Russia is prefixed a preamble In which reference is made to a number of points which certain of the experts desired mentioned -but which could not satisfactorily be incorporated In the articles.
BESTORATION OFi ETROPT..^(Financial^ Economic and Transport R e s o lutl onsJt.The British proposals under this heading have been agreed upon without much alteration.   Difficulties were felt about the immediate adoption of a currency convention, the text of which has consequently disappeared from the final report, although there is a recommendation for an international agreement at a suitable time.There was general agreement on the proposals embodied in the credit and exchange resolutions, but the support of the French representatives to the international corporation was subject to the reservation that they could not commit the French parliament to a guarantee of the capital.   Nor could they agree that restriction on exchange transactions for the purpose of preventing the export of capital were &quot;futile and mischievous&quot;.As regards the economic resolutions the proposals adopted are substantially those put forward by the British representatives.   The Italian representatives put forward a , far reaching proposal for a universal grant during a limited period of rab3t-favoured-nation treatment In customs matters., but the French refused to accept any such, scheme,&apos; which was accordingly not discussed in detail,ITo attempt has been made to draft a convention embodying the financial, economic and transport resolutions but it Is stated in the report that the substance of the resolutions is capable   of being so dealt with if it is finally decided at Genoa to,endeavour to conclude such a convention,A. list of those who attended is. attached.S.J,G.  -, 20, 3. 22.

SECRET and preliminary MEETINGSFOR THE .   GENOA CONFERENCE.Experts&apos; Report,The economic and financial experts of the powers responsible for the summoning of the Conference at their meeting for the exchange of views, after examining together a number of suggestions and schemes, have prepared draft resolutions embodying the ideas and proposals which met with general acceptance.The drafts are set forth in the pages of this report arranged under, the following headings\   PART I RUSSIA.Section I, Preamble.Section II. Conditions under which foreign enterprise and capital can be enlisted for the restoration of Russia,Chapter I.   Liquidation of past obligations. Chapter II, Provisions for the future. Section III.        Measures by which the speedy recovery of Russia would be facilitated^PART II Restoration of Europe. Section I.    Financial provisions. Section II.   Economic provisions^ Section III. Transport provisions.
PART I.RECONSTRUCTION OF RUSSIA. Section I. Preamble.The question of Russia has been approached both from the point of view of what is equitable and from the point of view of vhat is necessary for the economic rostora tion of Rus3ia8The economic restoration of Russia is largely dependent upon her enlisting the support of foreign enter-prise and capital,   Without a considerable transformation of the prevailing conditions which affect particularly trade and industry foreigners will be reluctant either to return to their former undertakings or to start fresh undertakings.   So long as precarious and unstable con-ditions continue, only speculators will be willing to ven-ture on trade, and there is a foar that the chief result would be net the reconstruction but the exploitation of Russia and the Russian people, which it is the purpose of the Governments represented at Genoa to avoidsEffective co-operatien between Russia and other European countries win be difficult to realise unless a determination is shewn in Russia to set to work whole heartedly to restore the economic life of Russia,   The -foundation is agriculture, and here no less than else-, where security both in respect of holdings and of the dis-posal of crops is an essential pre-requisite of revival. Once this security is realised, there is no doubt that foreign help will be forthcoming in the shape of agricul-tural implements and loans.
17    1In the industrial sphere it is even more apparent that revival oannot he expeoted in the absence of foreign assistance and capital, which will only become available when the goodwill and co-operation of the Bussian Government can be relied upon.   Active measures will be necessary for the protection and liberty of action of . employers, their employees, and for the protection of their industrial operations and their capital, combined with the right to hold the movable and immovable property necessary for the conduct of business and with the liberty to import what is requisite and to dispose of the products of their undertakings.   Much the same may be said of transport, in which oase foreign firms win have to be relied upon for the furnishing ef material and plant, in-cluding fresh rolling stock, and the setting up of repair shops; and it needs no emphasis that the reorganisation of transport is essential to the industrial and agricultural recovery of Bussia,The question of the instrument by which effect could be given to these conditions and to contingent provisions has net been considered, nor the relation of any such in-instrument to existing trade agreements with Russia, These with certain other questions have been reserved as political. Indications are given in the drafts which follow of some of the points reserved.
Seotion II.Conditions under which foreign enterprise and capital can be enlisted for the Restoration of Russia.The Seotion is divided into two ohapters:-Ohapter   I.   Liquidation of past obligations. Ohapter II.   Provisions for the futuro.Chapter I.Note.    It will be understood that the proposals drafted relating to claims (Articles 1-7 and the Annexes) are without prejudice to any advice whioh Govern-ments may think fit to obtain from the parties interested in the settlement whether as being entitled under contracts with former Russian Governments or as having suffered loss since the events of 1917.Artiole 1, The Russian Soviet Government shall aocept thefinancial obligations of its predecessors, viz, the Imperial Russian Government and the Russian Provisional Government, towards foreign Powers and their nationals. Note. The question whether the title &quot;Russian SovietGovernment&quot; applj.es only to the Soviet Government at Moscow or should include all other Soviet Governments In Russia is a political one whioh it is for the Governments to decide.    Similarly no precise definition is attributed to the words 8Russia&quot; and &quot;Russian&quot;,
The same applies-to the .quest!on whether ,,-and,. if so, to what extent, new states which have teen recognised as such and whioh were formerly part of Russia, as well as States whioh have acquired part of the former territory of Russia, should undertake part of the obligations dealt with in those provisions.article 2, The Russian Soviet Government shall recognise thefinanolal engagements entered into bofore this date by all authorities in Russia, prcvinoial or looal or by public utility undertakings in Russia, with other Powers cr their nationals, and shall guarantee the fulfilment thereof,Article 3, The Russian Soviet Government shall undertakeliability for all aotual and direct losses, whether arising out of breach of contract or otherwise, suffered by nationals of other Powers, due to the action tor negligence of the Soviet Government or its predecossors or of any provincial er local authorities, or of an agent of any such government or authority.Article 4. The liabilities under the preceding Articles will bedetermined by a BRussian Debt Commission&quot; and by &quot;Mixed Arbitral Tribunals&quot; to- be set up,    A scheme for the establishment of these bodies is contained in Annexes I and II,     They shall determine the amount and method of payment to bo made whether by way of compensation or otherwise as laid down in Annexes I - III,Article 5. All inter-governmental debts, liabilities and obligations of every sort which arose between the Russian Government on the one hand and a foreign Government on the other hand after August 1, 1914, shall be considered to be completely discharged&apos; by the payment of the net suras laid - down in a schedule to be agreed, .
To add to Article 7.This article shall also apply In the oase of any country, the Government of which has assumed responsibility for any Russian Government loan, floated in that country in the period named.-
Artiole 6. Without prejudice to the provision of Article 116of the Treaty of Versailles, the net sums fixed under Artiole 5 shall take into aooount all claims-by Russian nationals for loss or damage arising directly from hostile military or naval operations, or from other operations of a similar nature and any other claims specified at the time of tho adoption of the schedule \ referred to in Artiole 5.Article 7. Balances standing to the credit of a former russian Government in any bank situate in a country the Government of which made advances to a former Russian Government between August 1, 1914, and November 7, 1917, shall be transferred to the Government which made the advances and the liability of the Russian Soviet Govern-ment in respect of tho advances shall be pro tanto reduced.The transfer provided for in the preceding paragraph shall not prejudice the rights of third parties.ANNEXES X.Note.       With regard to the security on whioh the Russian debt is In future to be charged, two solutions have been put forward by different delegations.    They are shown, where necessary, in parallel oolumns In Annexes I to III.    Agreement has not been arrived at in favour of either of these two solutions or of any of the numerous Intermediate solutions which might be devised.
ANNEX I. RUSSLft.1T DEBT COLBvilSSION.1. A Russian Debt Commission shall be establishedconsisting of members nominated by the Russian Government and members nominated by the other Powers, together :71th an independent Chairman chosen from outside by-agreement among the other members, or, in default, named by the League of Nations, either through the Council or through the Permanent Court of International Justice.2.

issue,rates of interest-and terms of redemption of the new Russian bonds referred to In paragraph (b).(d) nil.(d).   To determine, if necessary among the revenues of Russia, those which should be specially assigned to the servioe of the debt, for example an allocation of certain taxes or of royalties or dues upon undertakings in Russia,,Should occasion arise to control, if the Commission thinks fit, the collection of all or part of these assigned revenues, and to deal with the proceeds.These assignments and this control (if imposed) should cease as soon as the Russian debt service -appears adequately&apos; assured by the inclusion of the appropriate sums in the Russian budget.
ANNEX II.   &apos; DETERMINATION OF CLAIMS.The liabilities of the Russian Government under Artioles 1 to 3 shall be assessed in accordance with the following principles:AThe responsibility for claims provided for in Artiole S    shall be determined by the Mixed Arbitral Tribunals in accordance with the provisions of this Report and in default with the general principles of International Law.Russian Government bonds in foreign currencies will be revived with all the conditions of the contract but interest and repayment of capital due from the dato when payments ceased until /November 1, 19277 will be funded.and the bonds will be secured in the same way as the new Russian Bonds in accordance with Annex III 5. Provincial, Municipal, Railway or Public Utility Bonds in foreign currencies will be revived with all the conditions of the contract but interest and repayment of capital due from the date when payment ceased until (November 1, 1927,) will be funded..    All such bonds shall be guaranteed by the Soviet Government whether guaranteed by any former Government of Russia or not.and the bonds will be secured inthe same way as the new Russian Bondsin accordance with Annex III, 5.
&quot;II        Russian Government Rouble Loans or Provincial, Municipal, Railway or Publio Utility Bonds issued in roubles will if proved to have been continuously in foreign ownership since the date of repudiation by the Russian Government be exchangeable into new Russian Bonds.The present value of the obligations in respect of capital and interest embodied in the original bond, in so far as they have not been fulfilled, shall first be calculated in roubles, and then converted into; the foreign currency at the rate determined in paragraph 16.The present(value of the new bond should be equal to the present value in the foreign currency of the original bond, interest being calculated at the rate to be prescribed under the provisions of Annex III, 2.Kew Russian Bonds will be issued in respect of funded interest and capital due for repayment between the date when payment ceased and (November I, 1927).Claims not provided for under Paragraphs 3 to 5 of this Annex in respect of injury to property, rights and interests shall, subject to any agreements between the Soviet Government and such of the other Power as may be concerned be dealt with on the following principles.^Claimants will be entitled to demand the return of the property, rights and interests.If the property, rights or interests are still in existence and capable of identification, they will be returned and compensation for their use or for iigury thereto during the dispossession will in default of agreement between the soviet Government and the private party concerned be settled by the Mixed Arbitral Tribunals.     Agreements for doneesslons in relation to public utility undertakings shall be modifiedf so as to be brought into harmony with present eoonomlc oonditions, fori iexample as regards charges, duration of concessions and conditions of operation.
If the property,rights and interests are not still in existence or cannot he identified, or the claimant does not desire their return, the claiL. may by agreement between the Soviet Government and the private party concerned be satisfied either by the grant of similar property rights or interests coupled with compensation to be agreed or failing agreement to bo fixed by the Mixed Arbitral Tribunals, or by any other agreed settlement.In all other cases claimants shall be entitled to compensation on a monetary basis to be fixed by the Mixed Arbitral Tribunals,Note,   In the opinion of the experts it may be necessary to add some condition in the case of claims for destruc-tlon, loss or damage of property, rights or interests which were acquired subsequent to the events of 1917, It raitfht be desirable to give the Mixed Arbitral Tribunals a discretion, in some cases at any rate,to take the matter into account when they aro satisfied that the price at which the property was acquired renders payment of compensation on the basis of the full value.of the property Inequitable,11.
The tribunal in assessing compensation shall take account primarily of the aotual value in roubles of the property, rights or interests at November .1,1917, but may make allowance for any temporary and special circumstances which may at that time have materially affected the value,VJhere a debtor is entitled, or if he had been a national of one of the other Powers, would have been entitled, to claim compensation under Chapter I, the creditor may (whether the debtor has claimed compensation or not) make a direot claim against the Soviet Government in respect of the loss arising from his unpaid debt instead of against the debtor. ,Any property restored in accordance with paragraph (7) shall be subject to any charges or obligations attaching thereto upon November 1, 1917, without prejudice to the rights of creditors to make a direct claim against the Soviet Government.Any liability met by the Soviet Government under the preceding paragraph will be set off against the compensation payable to the debtor; but if the Soviet Government has already paid the compensation to the debtor, it may recover from the debtor the amount paid to the creditor but the liability of the former may be discharged in new Russian Bonds.Russian financial, industrial and commercial companies which on November 1, 1917, were controlled by nationals of other Powers or in which at the same date such nationals possessed a substantial interest shall, if the majority of the foreign interests (shareholders and bondholders) so desire, be covered by the term &quot;Nationals of other Powers&quot; wherever used in Chapter I and the Annexes.IS.
12, In oases In which a claim is not made under thepreceding paragraph or other provision of this Chapter or its annexes any national of the other Powers who is a shareholder In any Russian Company whatever may claim compensation in accordance with article 3 for the Injury done to his holding in the company,13. Claims, excluding those referred to in paragraphs-5 abovey but including claims for monetary compensation arising from death or personal Injury, shall be referred by the commission for adjudication and assessment on a monetary basis as promptly as possible by Mixed Arbitral Tribunals,14, All claims shall be registered with the Russian DebtCommission, and options shall be exercised within one year from the esifb^alishment of the Commission or such longer period as may be permitted by the Commission for particular cases or classes of cases.   The Russian Soviet Government shall not be liable in respect of any claim not registered within the prescribed period,15. No claim shall bo recognised in respect of rights which had ceased legally to exist before March, 1917,16, The rates of conversion between paper roubles and thevarious foreign currencies will be fixed by the Russian-Debt Commission at the time of Issuing the new Russian Bonds,   For this purpose the Commission will first ascertain the average gold value of the rouble in October, 1917, and will then calculate the equivalent of that gold value in each of the foreign currencies at the time of the issue of the bonds,17, Interest at the rate prescribed under paragraph (2) of annex III shall accrue as from November 1, 1917 on all amounts awarded by the tribunal.
ANNEX III.29NEW RUSSIAN BONDS./ *1.

In general the bonds will be expressed In the currency of the holder&apos;s country.     Nevertheless the Debt Commission may allow him, if he so requests, to take bonds in the currencies of certain specified countries.4.     In order to determine the value of the bonds for any pay-ment under these provisions the bonds shall be discounted   at the rate of Interest prescribed under paragraph 2 above. 5.     The bonds shall be &amp;       or (5)     The bonds shall be a charge on the whole assets charge, primarily upon assets of the Russian State. selected by the Russian DebtCommies ion,&apos;in accordance with Annex I,.2(d) and secondarily on the whole assets of the Russian State.6.

bonds, except for a preferential right for redemption during the moratorium period if any redemption be then possible.7.     The Russian Soviet Govern-ment shall be permitted to make drawings, if it desires to do so, before the expiration of the moratorium period, giving priority to the Interest Bonds.7,     The Russian Debt Commission will decide whether the yield of the assigned revenues permits of drawings before the expira-tion of the moratorium period; in such drawings priority shall be given to the Interest Bonds.

PART II.RESTORATION OP EUROPE.The drafting of a Convention has not been attempted, but the resolutions are In such a form that their substance could, If It were thought desirable, be embodied In a Convention.The resolutions are arranged in three groups, viz:-Seotion IFinancial.Section IIEconomic.Section IIITransport.
Section IFINANCIAL SECTIONChapter 1* CURRENCYArticle 29.   An essential requisite for the economioreconstruction of Europe is the achievement by each country of stability in.the value of its currency.   No country can gain control of it3 own currency so long as there is a deficiency in the annual budget whioh is met by the creation of paper money or bank credits.   It is for every oountry to overcome such a deficiency by its own independent efforts, only then will its way be open to currency reform.Article 30.   Measures of currency reform will be facilitated if the practice of continuous co-operation among oentral banks oan be developed.   A permanent association or entente for the co-operation of central banks, not necessarily confined to Europe, would provide   opportunities of co-ordinating credit policy, without hampering the freedom of the several banks.   It is suggested that an early meeting of representatives of central banks should be held with a view to considering how best to give effect to this reoommendation.Article 31.   It is desirable that all Iftiropean currencies should be based upon a common standard.Article 32,   Gold is the only common standard which all European countries could at present agree to adopt.Article 33.   In a number of countries it will not be possible for some years to restore an effective gold standard; but it is in the general interest that European Governments should declare now that this is their ultimate object, and should agree on the programme by way of which they intend to achieve it.
Article 34,   In each country the first step towardsre-establishing a gold standard will be the   balancing of the annual expenditure of the State without the creation of fresh credit unrepresented by new assets,Artiole 35,   The next step will be to determine and fix the gold value of the monetary unit.    This step oan only be taken in each country when the eoonomio oir cum stances permit; for the country will then have to deoide the vital question, whether to   adopt the old gold parity or a new parity approximating to the exohange value of the monetary unit  at the time,Artiole 36.     These steps might by themselves suffioe to establish a gold standard, but its successful maintenance would be materially promoted, not only by the proposed association or entente of central banks, but by an international convention to be adopted at a suitable time.     The purpose of the convention would be to centralise and oo-ordinate the demand for gold, and so to avoid those wide fluctuations in the purchasing power of gold, which might otherwise result fr*m the simultaneous and competitive efforts of a number of countries to secure metallio reserves.    It is suggested that the convention should embody some means of economising the use of gold by maintaining reserves in the form of foreign balanoes, such, for example, as the gold exchange standard, or an international clearing system.
&apos; Chapter -II OREDITS.Article 57.      Whilst private credit will undoubtedly again become available as soon as currencies are stabilised and oonfidenoe is restored, it is recognised that under existing conditions special machinery is neoessary for facilitating the immediate oo-operation of the eoonomisally stronger oountries for reoonstruotion purposes.   The negotiations now proceeding for the establishment of an International Corporation are accordingly to be welcomed,Artiole 38.      It is essential for oountries in need of oredlts to take steps at once to make their assets available to serve as security for the assistance they require whether through the proposed International Corporation or through other ohannelsj for this purpose they should enter Into consultation at the earliest possible moment with the Corporation when established pr with other agencies for the purpose of seouring such oo-operation.
Chapter III, EXCHANGES.Article 39.    One of the chief obstacles In the way of the restoration of trade is the collapsed condition and instability of many of the European exchanges, and this is mainly due to the continual depreciation of currency, the failure of production for export and the lack of trade facilities.The artificial control of operations in exchange, whether by requiring a licence for transactions in exchange, or by limiting the prices at which transactions may be effected, or by preventing free dealings in forward exchange, are futile and mischievous.It is therefore recommended that all regulations of the kind indicated attempting to limit fluctuations in exchange by means of artificial control of exchange operations should be abolished at the earliest possible date.Article 40.   Within twelve months, after substantial progress has been made in the restoration of a country&apos;s exchanges any special restrictions imposed on imports from that country on the ground of depreciated exchange should be removed,NOTEt   Some of the experts desired to add that the prohibition of transactions for any specified purposes was equally to be condemned, but others were unable to accept this without the qualification that it was subject to any regulations which may be adopted solely for the purpose of preventing the export of capital.
In view of the agreement relative to restrictions and prohibitions signed by the representatives of certain States at the Conference at Portorose (Protoool No.l) in November 1921, it is suggested that those States should adopt the recommendations of that Conference and should take the necessary measures to give effect to them without delay.Inasmuch as the development of normal trade with all countries Is only possible where traders are in a position to ascertain some time in advance the conditions under which goods can be legally imported into and exported from each country, it is proposed that any Customs duties and Customs restrictions Incident to importation and exportation should be regulated by the following principles.A. Customs TariffSgAll Customs Tariffs should be published; such publication should be accompanfe d by a dear and precise indication in regard to each category of goods of all the duties which are leviable on the importation or exportation of the goods concerned.The tariffs should be made so far as possible applicable over substantial periods of time, and ohanges in rates and In customs regulations should be made as rarely as possible and duly published, the practice of frequest modification for the purpose- of. economic n^faj^helng-entire^ly abandoned,.Section II ECONOMIC    SECTION.Chapter 1* Custom Tariffs and Restrictions,
No duties should he maintained or imposed after ... on the exports of raw materials other than such duties as are found desirable for revenue purposes; export duties imposed for such purposes should fee applied without any discrimination as between different foreign countries of destination.Btl,   Import and Export Prohibitions.The system Of prohibition or restriction ogf imports or exports which certain States have introduced, temporarily to protect their finances or to control their markets is in principle injurious from the point of view of the economio restoration of Europe.,  Every&apos; country&apos; has nevertheless   the right, unless precluded by treaties, to prohibit absolutely the importation of goods of certain descriptions in the interests of national health, national security, national moral3 or for other&apos; special purposes, or to allow the importation of specified ctfmmeditios enly if consigned to recognised organisations either for the. purpose&apos; of giving effect to a State monopoly or for seeing that the whole importation is put to a specified use, but prohibitions framed for any such purpose should be publicly annbuncod and as&apos; limited in extent as possible.   Such prohibitions and monopolies Should not be used for the purpose of discriminating arbitrarily between different foreign markots or different sources of supply.-Where for any reason it is desired to limit the ameunt of any commodity to be imported through ordinary trade , channels such limitation should be effected by the medium of &apos; customs duties rather than by a system of prohibition modified by licences j every Government should at once..27-,
irticle 47.   examine the possibility of abandoning or reducing to the (Contd.)smallest possible dimensions the number of goods to which the I latter system is spplied, so that the general pre-war position in this regard may-be attained so soon as possible and, in any case before . *  .   Bave in so far as it has been modified &quot;by general International Conventions concluded since the outbreak of war. Article 48, Pending the complete abolition of the system of prohibition accompanied by lic^-sus-y licences should be granted on conditions which are publicly &quot;announced, tinambiguously stated, and uniformly applicable.   Any trader should accordingly be in a position easily to estimate in advance whether and under what conditions a licence is procurable. Administration should be on the simplest lines possible and every arrangement should be made to secure that applications for licences are dealt with expeditiously by competent bodies - organised for the purpose. . In the grant of licences there should be no discrimination of any kind in respect of the nationality of the Importer, the origin of the goods or their nature, nor should the grant be dependent on the prices at which they are to be purchased. Article 49, Similar provisions mutatis mutandis   to those laid downin Articles 46 to 48 should bo applied in regard to any restriction of exportation which any Government may find necessary for national security or for the ^purpose of con-serving its economic resources; the licensing system should be such as to allow of no discrimination in regard to the   --prices at which the goods are to be disposed of.
C,     General,Where the admission or transit of gsods of any description into any country or the duties leviable thereon are--dependent on the fulfilment of particular technical conditions with regard, for instance, to their constitution, their purity, their district of origin, their sanitary condition, the Governments should come to arrangements with each other providing for the acceptance in.,accordance with rules and principles mutually agreed of certificates issued by competent scientific institutions or recognised authorities or bodies in the country of origin of the goods.
NOTE 1. In addition to the provisions contained in Articles 41-53 a suggestion was considered that resolutions should be sub-witted to tho G\3hoa- Conference for acceptance providing during a certain period for the mutual accord to each other by all the nations represented of the treatment of the most-favoured-&apos; nation in customs matters, subject to certain reservations which would be necessary to meet special difficulties. Whilst it was generally recognised that on purely economic grounds some such provision could be welcomed in the present general situation, some of the experts did not feel able to accept the proposals as presented, jNOTE 2. The experts have also considered the question of facilitating the use of arbitration clauses in commercialit.. \\contracts re L-ting to.foreign business.   They agreed that the question, was one calling for careful consideration, but in view particularly of its technical and legal aspects they were of opinion that further investigation of the subject was necessary before a resolution could be prepared for submission to the Genoa Conference.Article 51. The necessary steps should be taken to secure thatI the preceding provisions should be observed in the letterV and in the spirit by all Government Authorities, central or local, and that no regulations of an administrative character shall be issued which would conflict therewith. Artiole 52. It is desirable to arrange for enquiry to be made fromtime to time through a suitable organisation, e.g. the League of Nations, into the progress made by the various States in carrying these principles into operation. Article 53. All the governments concerned should Inform immediately the organisation referred to in Article *2 of all changes in customs tariffs or in the regulations relating to pro-hibitlon or restriction of imports or exports.

47   chapter III.PROTECTION&apos; Off INDUSTRIAL PRQPIRTY AMD OOPYRIGETS.Article 56*       It is desirable that all European States which hare not already done so should at once take steps to adhere to the International Convention of Paris of Maroh 20, 1883, as revised at Washington in 1911, for the protection of industrial property and to the International Convention of Berne of September 9, 1886, revised at Berlin on November 13, 1908, and completed by the Additional Protocol signed at Berne on March 20, 1914, for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Work.Article 5V.        Pending such adhesion every European State should, in so far as Industrial, Literary and Artistic property is not now reciprocally protected as between itself and other States, give effective protection to such property on oondltion of reciprocity; and should further -save in so far as such rights have been or shall be dealt with by the Treaties of Peaoe with Germany, Austria, Hungary, Bulgaria and Turkey - recognise, restore -and protect all rights in such property belonging to the nationals of other States which would now be in foroe in its territory, but for any exoeption-al legislative or administrative aotion taken in consequence of war or revolution between August 1,1914, and the present date.Note.   In the opinion of some of the experts it is highly desirable that any European State which Is not already a party thereto should adhere to the Arrange-ment signed at Madrid on April 14, 1891, for the repression of false indications of origin.
Section III.  -   &apos;-.       . TRANSPORT SECTION.Article 58.        Efficient transport ia an essential requisite for the revival of production and trade.   It ia therefore desirable that States should continue to devote their unremitting efforts to the restoration and improvement of the organisation of their railways, harbours and other means of oommunicationj where necessary, surveys of requirements should be made under adequate expert direction, and where the present resouroes of any State appear to be inadequate to restore the equipment and structure of these undertakings, including the fuel supply, steps should be taken without delay to secure assistance, whether from the International Corporation when established or from other suitable sources.Artiole 59*       .The principles of the Agreement for the Regulation of International Railway Traffio signed at Portorose on November 23, 1921, should immediately be applied to all the European States represented at Genoa.   The Council of the League of Nations should be Invited to enquire into the measures already taken to carry the Portorose Agreement and Recommendations into effect.Article 60.        It is desirable that representatives of the railway administrations of the States oonoorned should attend a conference to define what further steps are necessary to restore international traffic conditions at least as satisfactory as those existing before the war, and should agree upon recommendations to their governments.   Similar conferences should be held In regard to water communications and harbours.
^ It is desirable that favourable consideration shouldbe givon to the recommendations of these conferences with a view to their immediate application or if necessary to the conclusion aa early as possible of conventions to give effect to them.Article 61. The conditions of international transport should notbe determined by politioal considerations but rather by commercial and technical considerations, a3 in the, case of the Conventions concluded at Barcelona on &apos; . . April 20th, 1921, regarding Freedom of Transit and the Regime of Navigable Waterways of International Concern, together with the additional Protocol to the latter Convention, and the Recommendations relative to the International Regime of Railways.   It Is desirable that the various other conventions provided for in treaties now in force should be prepared and put into operation as soon as possible.
