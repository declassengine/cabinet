In DUBLIN it is difficulty to gauge the strength of the twoopposing forces, Free State Army and Irish Republican Army.    Onefact is, however, apparent, outrages either against the law or against the Provisional Governments troops by the latter remainunpunished.9. Murders of former ^ervanta of the Crown are being carried outby the Republican element in Southern Ireland.    General lawlessness is on the increase as illustrated by tho number of murders, bank robberies, hold up of trains, raids on Railway Stations and Goods Yards.(Sgd. ) J.B.

&quot;A&quot;Genoral situation in tho oth Divisions! Area,April 9th, 1922.There are neither P-. ee State Troops nor free State police in this Divisional Areai, .  Until recently a few ofthe latter did duty ip. Tipperary Town, hut they, were notbeing paid and were roughly handled hy the Republicans andhave now oeaserl to function..    During the past fow caysa &quot;Civic Guard&quot; has been formed and is being paid from fundsjclleoted locally.The great majority of tho I.R.A. in this area have refuse to recognise the official G.H.Q.., at Beggars Push, Duhlin, or to support the   to visional Government in any way.It has he come exceedingly difficult to oh tain any information o?/ing to the fact that there ere neither troops nor polioe in any part of the area, except Cork.   Ballincollig and Queenstown; and the fact that the Civil Population is more afraid of the I.R.A.j and I.R.P., now than at any other time.during the rebellion.Prom tho information available it would appear that tho &amp;ree State party stands very little ohenca of sacoess at the forthcoming elections in the South of Ireland.   The vast majority of tho civil, population - with any stase In tho country - is anxious tb vote for the Free State Party, hut will most probably vote for tho party which is able to intimidate thorn most, that is the Republican party.There appears to bo no split in the 1st Cork Brigade of the I.P.A.     It supports the Ropublioaa-party and does not recognise the official G.H..Q.     The labour Party is Very strong in this aria end will support the Republican TaiHy with a&apos; view to securing a &quot;&apos;orker&apos;s Republic. .Thoro is a slight split in the 2nd Cork Brigado but the majority of its members are republican.     This is tho only area so far in which Free State Election Offioes havo be on opened.     These were opened a few days ago in tho Royal Hotel ,Foi noy.     Two. days later thoy wore seized hy Republicans and the election agents arrested.     The latter are now being detained in the Uovt Barracks, Permoy,which are now in the hands of the Republicans.Tho old 3rd Cork Bra. is now divided and there aro at present two separate units which oall themselves Cork    Ho.3 Brigade.     One, commanded by Bdc. Comdt. Ton Hales, . contains the great ma;) ority of the old I.R.A. and supports the Republican Party.     The oth or , commanded by John Hales... , Tom&apos;s brother,, supports the Free State Party but has few followers and practically no influence.Se-seral meetings have been held in this area in support of the Republican Party.     A few meetings have been held&apos; in support of the Free State but little enthusiasm was shown.The old 4th Cork Brigade is also divides and there are at present two units known as Cork Ko.4 Brigade; - One is
Commanded by Bde, Coranandant Sean Moylan T.D. who has a large following and supports the republican party.     This Brigade no*7 occupies the barracks, at Buttevant.    Denis J. Lyons of Kanturc&quot;, late Commandant of the Kanturk Battalion is one of the supporters of the pj.ee State Party hut he was arrested a few days ago by the other side is now under arrest in Buttevant Barracks.      Denis Calvin is in command of the other Brigade which supports the Provisional GoYerhment,   The strength of these Brigades is not known. Both of the Brigade Commandants are determined men and liSsly to fight to the last.     Qach has a good deal of influence, and a bitter contest and considerable disorder is inevitable during the elections.The 5th Cork Brigade is entirely republican and in the Bantry Area particularly the republican party is very strong.Little is., known regarding the situation in Kerry beyond the fact that Kerry rebels su ported the republicans in Limerick during the recent troubl e there and an officer who has recently, been in that area states that there is a strong republican feeling there.     On the other   hand 100 recruits were obtained in the Tralee area last week for the Free Staco Army but these we-re arrested on entering the 4th Cork Brigade area,and are now detained in the barracks at Buttevant.   One -of these men was wounded during a struggle at Mallow Station when being arrested by the &quot;Republicans*:In County Clare the I.B.A. is divided.     Nothing is known at pre sent regar ding the attitude of the -Jest Clare Brigade,     The Mid-Clare Brigade, under Bde.Comdt.Prank Barrett, is&apos; supporting the republican party.   The Brerman family had a large following in &quot;3ast Clare but there have boen a number of desertions and some doubt exists as to whether the Brennans can command a majority there,   The failure of the. Provisional Government to show a firm front during the trouble in Limerick resulted in many of these men going over to the other side.The Mid and West Clare Brigades   .re both republican-and! there are very few members of either who support the Free State Party.The Bast Limerick Brigade under Denis Hannigan of Anglesboro, is supporting the Provisional Government and will, probably support the Free State Party.     There have, however,1 been a number of desertions and the labour element In this area is very strong, and being of the Bolshie type, will support the Republicans.   It is not possible to form an opinio at present as to which party is likely to have a majority there.The North Tipperary Brigade is chiefly republican. It is -now in possession of a Rolls loyce Armoured Car which was handed over to the -representatives of the Provisional Government by the R.I.C.The Mid and South Tipperary Brigades are both republican, Sinn :?oin Clubs have been broken up and Republican Clubs established.    The Vice Commandant of the Cahir Battalion - Miohael. ladrigan - supported the Free State Party but ;he , has. now disappeared.: There, is a certain amount of agrarian trouble In the -vicinity of Tipperary Xmm and tenants of the Staff or d-0-1-Brian estate recently refused to -pay their rents and seized the rent books from the agent-   4
Agent whom they chased out of the town.Water for 3 on the. *7hole appears to he Republican.   There are a few supporters of the Free State Party in the 1st Brigade but the majority have gone over to the Republican side sinoe the Dublin Convention.The Free State Party, in this area is still, however,   . strong enough   to secure seats at the election as the civil population .in Waterford is not intimidated to tho same extent as. in other areas.   Dungarvan area is more doubtful and it is probable that Republicans will meet with success here. &quot;Kilkenny appears to. be. ropublioan but the information available is; meagro. &apos;Little is knovm regarding tho attitude of tho Wexford Brigades except that the Transport Workers Union in Bnnisoorthy and other fairly, large towns has threatened to striiQ if asked to handle Belfast goods.On the whole&apos;it is estimated that 75$, at least, of the I.R.A. in this Divisional Aroa support the Republican Party and they will be augumented by the labour party.Intimidation is practised .more freely now than at any other time by the Republicans and for this reason the I.R.A. is likely to have considerable Influence over the elections.The boycott of Belfast Goods and prohibition of re-cruiting for the Free State Forces has become practically general throughput the Divisional area,   No attaoks have recently been made on members, of the Crown Forces but robbery and so forth has increased and so far no attempt has been ma do by the Provisional Government to bring, the culprits to justice, probably because it realises that it has not the power to. do so.As far as is known at present all the Military Barracks handed over to the Provisional Government representatives are now in the:hands of Republicans and in all cases they were taken over Without a flight.Raids on muffiition..stores and oonvoys will most probably be made by the republicans should favourable opportunities arise, but on the whole I do not think they are anxious to some Into conflict with the Crown For cos.   I. do not anticipate attacks on individuals except in isolated cases   \-and in the case of individuals who made them solves eonsbicubus during the rebellion.  -Disturbances are. almost certain to take place during \ tho elections and in. districts .such as Clare, East Limerick, &apos; and North Cork,..where1 thore .is a&apos;oer tain amount of opposition, these are lively to be serious.   Rioting is, however, a: normal pr bee our a during elections, in this country trtion there is any opposition. &apos; &apos;There are rumours of trouble at faster but such       -rumours have been spread just -before 3as tor -every year - since. the 1916 rebellion;and so /far -there is nothing to go ohv. It is impossible at the&apos;. moment-to say what action either party is likely., to take.
APPENDIX &quot;B&quot;.SITUATION IN CORK - 5th APRIL, 1928.1.        It must be realised that the seurces of Information which were available in July, 1921, are not now available;    ihe,R.I&apos;.C, know nothing of the local situation, as they now never leave their barracks;   civilian &quot;sources&quot; have to be very careftilly approached, as It would not be. fair to attract towards them the attention of the I.R.A.   . ;2.       It may be stated at the outset that no split has occurred In the I.R.A. in Cork;   they are, and always have been,  firm supporters of the republic, and the Provisional Government has no       (j status of any sort whatsoever in the City, and surrounding country.This Is being publicly stated almost daily by the .I..R.A. leaders;   the speeches of Sean Meylan at Kanturk on 2nd April, and that of Thomas Hales at Bandon,  also on 2nd April are typical illustrations of the way in which the rank and file are being educated in republican interests.     The speech of Sean Mcylan was particularly bad, and urged the I.R.A, to attack the loyalists &quot;who have plenty of good fat cows.&quot;The Provisional Government named Captain Mahoney, I.R.A, Llaiswn Officer, as their representative in Cork.     This person, when approached on the subject, stated he did not recognise the Provisional Government and took his orders only from the I.R.A.He is himself in bad odour with the extremists as. being too moderate in his views, and has several times been threatened with arrest by the O.C. of the. 1st Cork Brigade.3. (a).    The feeling of the civil population in East Cork is -strongly In favour-of the Provisional Government.     This was plainly demonstrated by the. contrast in the receptions of De Valera and Michael Collins respectively at their recent meetings in Cork. &apos;It is confirmed by conversations with local men, business and professional men in Cork, Priests, shop keepers and farmers are all of the opinion that given a. fair fight at the polls, the Provisional Government would win an overwhelming, victory.       The general public is.however mor* pessimistic as to. the future than ever before.     The present lawlessless is felt much more keenly than the pages of the Press would lead one to suppose.     The majority of the robberies which occur in the country districts are never reported, both because there is no one to report them to,  and for fear&apos;of reprisals.     Tradesmen&apos;are unable ta recover debts as they are in fear of being denounced to the I.R.A., while for the same reason they dare not refuse to supply the goods for itiich they know they will never be paid.     Although many cases cf intimidation, destruction of property and even attempted murder are occurring In connection with the strike of farm labourers round Cork, only one has so far been reported in the Press,(b)   Unpleasant as the present conditions are, the prospects for.-the future are infinitely worse..  . Everyone is agreed that the present split will hardly be settled without bloodshed, and it Is fully realised that in the next &quot;war&quot; there will be no neutrals.It follows naturally on the above that the general attitude towards the Crown Forces Ik more friendly than it has been for a long time, and their departure is viewed with great apprehension. It is doubtful, however, whether, in the event of a fresh war, in . which the Crown Forces joined, we should receive much mere assistance than in the past, at any rate until we had definitely gained the upper hand.
4. The attitude of the I.R.A. towards the Crown Forces has certainly not changed in feeling. We have not however been seriously, molested.   s After the general outbreak on the 11th Januaryfthere was no incident for a considerable.period with the exception of the murder of-Lieutenant GENOCIIIO.     This is., however, due to the precautions taken by the Crown Force&quot;s rather than to any desire on the part of the rebels to knep the truce if it can be broken with advantage and impunity. .   On the night of, 5/.6th- March a campaign was begun1of- seizing bandoliers from. R.A.5.C.&apos;and Transport personnel T/hen walking out. .  The liaison officon was .plainly informed that thi? would not be-tolerated&quot;and would entail bloodshed in future, since then - the;&apos;practi,ce has ceased,:For the reasons stated in para. 2, the; attitude of the I.R.A. towards Provisional:Government troops cannot be defined.     The latter do not exist/in County Cork.  - The -attitude of the former towards the 1 Provisional Government was however plainly illustrated In the violent 1 scenes when Michael Collins visited Cork.     It is to be remarked that I none of the Cork members of Dail Elreann professing Free State ; sympathies care to appear in Cork except in the company of Michael \ Collins and his body guard.     Provisional Government troopfe, if and i when they do appear, will, undoubtedly be most hostilely received. Some officers of the No. 1 Cork, Brigade who attempted, to join the &quot;Regular Army&quot; or &quot;Civic Guard&quot; were arrested by order of the Brigade Commandant.Towards the civil population, the I.R.A. have on the whole shown a tolerant attitude :where they have met with no opposition.     They do 1 not appear however to regard, the ordinary public as a serious factor land have ho intention of allowing them to have a say in the conduct I of affairs.     When confronted (for the first time) by an actively 1 hostile crowd cn St., Patrick1 s eve&apos; in Cork, the I.R.A. opened fire on I the crowd without  -hesitation, killing one man and wounding several.15,      Shortly before Christmas 1921, there was a marked decrease inI &quot;Field Training&quot; by the I.R.A.     The numerous schools of signalling,I rmisketry, etc., were broken up and no cases have since been reportedI of civilians being conscripted for training.     The rebel energiesI have been chiefly directed&apos;towards the acquisition of arms, equipmentland transport. vehiolets.     In this, with the exception of a few vehicles,I they have&quot;been very unsuccessful in County Cork until the unfortunateI incident of the &quot;UPNOR&quot;.     It Is believed however that they have i received a good supply of revolvers and ammunition from other sources.JI Rifles are s&apos;till believed to be scarce as they are said to have been the principal: objective when seising the &quot;UPNOiV&apos;.     Men armed withI revolvers are commonly seen in the country, but not with rifles.I        There have been few changes in personnel.     John HALES Is so far I the only prominent, officer of the 1st and 3rd Brigades whom we know to I be a supporter of the Free State.     His brother TOM has assumed comma.nrt I of the 3rd Brigade -and is a Republican, .I        T.B.(BemIe) BARRY is now the leading man In Cork;   his exactI Position and rank are not known but. in personal influence. heI easily surpasses William LYNCH, Commandant of the 1st Southern.1 Division.     His prestige will have been greatly enhanced by his recent^successful exploit, i.e.. the . capture of&apos; the &quot;UFNOR&quot;,   -W&apos;      In attempting to..forecast the Intentions of the I.R.A. as to the ,&apos;future one thing appears certain, that they carrot he much longer ,iheld in cheek.     Our experience - in dealing with them in the past hasBshown that they are invariably most active and most dangerous, afterla- success of any kind.
-   During the past winter they have enjoyed anuraber of minor successes against an enemy who was prevented bv the truce from retaliating and have acquired large supplies of munitions of war of every description;    their &quot;morale   has been heightened by the immunity they have enjoyed and the general use of &quot;soft soap&quot; by all parties,  including the English Press, after the truce. Finally many of them are ovit of work, many never intended to work and funds must be running low.     All these considerations point to an oxitburst in the near future.     Again referring .to past exper-ience, it appears possible that Easter week will be chosen for the commencement of the campaign.     Thi3 might take the form of a general attack on the forces of the Provisional Government; possibly on the Crown Forces remaining In Ireland.At present they evidently do not consider It worth while to provoke us, but when the decision&apos; to remain beyond the 20th is known this may cause a change in their plans.It is believed to be MrVDe yalera&apos;s Intention t$visit Cork at Eaeter time, and it is thought that he may take this , occasion to formally &quot;re-establish the republic&quot;.The other alternative is the establishment of the&quot;military dictatorship recently threatened in Dublin.Wote by G.O.C. 6th DiVision.   -There are parts of this that I consider as slightly pessimistic.     Any event&quot;&quot;in this country at the present time is possible, but some of those suggested&apos;are, I consider, very far from probable.7.  4.  22.Whitehall Gardens, S.1 . 13th April,  1922.
