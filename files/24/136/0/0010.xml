[THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 S G^Vgj^S ^* ffiRBT. Copy No,&apos;fs91Q. CABINET.Allotments Bill.Memorandum by the Minister- of Agriculture and Fisheries.In the King&apos;s speech at the opening of Parliament His Majesty promised that a Bill relating to allotments would be presented.   The attached Bill which I circulate for the consideration of the Home Affairs Committee proposes to oarry into effect the principal reoommendations of the Report of the Departmental Committee on Allotments, appointed by the Secretary/ for Scotland and myself.   Clauses 1 and 2 embody a compromise between the claims of allotment-holders for greater security of tenure and the claims of landowners td utilise their land to the best advantage without being liable to pay heavy compensation to allotment-holders when required to give up possession of their land.   Clause 1 restricts the resumption of land used for allotment-gardens to(a) resumption between 25th March and 29th September and only after six months&apos; notice,(b) re-entry after three months&apos; notice for building and industrial purposes and for the special purposes indicated in paragraph (b)f and(c) re-entry for breach of contract. This is supplemented by Clause 2 which restrictscompensation in future to cases In which the land Is resumed between the 25th March and the 29th September under the special powers of pagrgraph (b), Clause 1, and limits the compensation to the value of the crops and of the manure applied since the last crop.   The compensation at present payable In such a case covers the value of the labour applied since the last orop and the more serious item of compensation for disturbance under Section 11 of the Agriculture Act, 1920.
The representatives of the allotment-holders are willing to surrender these rights to compensation if they are given the security afforded by Clause 1, and the Committee appear to have been satisfied that owners of building land and other land of special value would, if relieved from their present liability for compensation, assent to the proposed restrictions on their rights of resumption.Clause 3 applies the Bill to Crown lands which are already affected by the Agricultural Holdings Acts, but excludes the land which is temporarily occupied under the Defence of the Realm Regulations, and will be given up next March.   As notices to quit have been given in respect of such land, it may not be necessary to retain such express exclusion,,Clause 4 extends for one year the power of an allotment authority to make orders for compulsory acquisition without the delay and     expense of obtaining confirmation by the Minister, Owing to the fact that much of the D.O.R.A. land will cease shortly to be available, the next year will be a period of urgency as regards acquisition of land for this purpose.Sub-seotion (2) of the clause facilitates the temporary user of land of railway and other public undertakings, which is not required at the moment for the purposes of the under-taking.Clause 5 enables boroughs and urban district councils to purchase land for perpetual rents instead of paying cash.,Clause 6 oonfers on councils of boroughs and urban districts, practically,the same powers as regards unoccupied land as were exerciseable by the Minister under the Defence of the Realm Regulations, except that the owner is under this clause given a power to resume possession on one month&apos;s notice If the land Is reasonably required for any other purpose than agriculture.   Under the Defence of the Realm Regulations he has
no such, power of resumption, though the Minister- relinquishes possession when the land is shown to be reasonably required for exceptional purposes.   The landowner is given the same right to compensation for his dispossession as he has In respect of D.O.R.A, land.Clause 7 restricts the obligation of borough and urban district councils to provide allotment-gardens of 20 poles, which is as large as is necessary in urban areas,Ciauce 8 requires allotment authorities in boroughs or urban districts to maintain, unless exempted by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries, allotment committees with a substantial&apos;4proportion of co-opted members representative of allotment-holders.   Though this may evoke opposition, it is strongly pressed for by the allotment-holders /ho have good cause to complain that in some Urban areas the allotment question ddes not obtain the consideration which it deserves, and in many cases is referred to an unsympathetic committee.Clause 9 merely extends the powers of a county council which already has power to let Its land to a parish council for allotments.Clause 10 is intended to meet the case where it is more convenient to help the men to get to their allotments than to acquire land nearer to the men&apos;s houses, which may command a greater price.Clause 11 readjusts the financial provisions as to allotments, but maintains the principle that the allotment undertaking is intended to be self-supporting except that there may be paid out of rates(a) the legal and other incidental expenses attaching to acquisition of land,(b) the costs of public roads across the allotments,(3)   the sinking fund charge for redemption of thepurchase money, which, though in itself a trivial sum, has been the subject of much controversy.
r77In this connection It may be pointed out that in the Small Holdings act of 1908, the incidental costs of acquisition of land for small holdings 7/as authorised to be paid out of state funds, but this did not apply to acquisition of land for allotments.The burden thus liable to fall on the rates should not be substantial.Adopting the precedent of the Land Settlement Aot of 1919, the rents are to be fair rents and not to depend on the cost of the particular land affected.Clause 12 enables the body providing the allotments to be rated instead of the actual occupiers, an arrangement convenient alike to the bodies   concerned and the rating authorities.Clause 13 makes certain amendments of the financial provisions applicable to allotments.Clause 14 deals with a difficulty which has arisen In the New Forest.   Under the Poor Relief Act 1831, Certain areas have been used for allotment gardens, but the period authorised in one such case, Lyndhurst allotments, is just expiring, and any attempt to renew the authority might raise a difficult question as to whether the Act of 1831 is consistent with the restriction on inclosure in the New Forest Act, 1877.   The loss of this land for allotments would be likely to create great difficulty, as Lyndhurst is surrounded by Forest and residential properties, and the commoners and the public will lose nothing which they- at present enjoy if the land continues in its present use.   It is not proposed that any land not at present in allotments should be used for such purpose.A.G. BOSCAWEN.March 29th, 1922,
