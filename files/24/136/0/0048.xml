W /ITKTS.J^CUPE^JLS^TEE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITAINlU majesty S GCVERUIEIJT .CABTKST . Reduction of Taxation. jRET Memorandum &quot;by the Minister of Health.00.39/f 7P*8During my recent visit to South Wales I had occasion to receive a deputation of the most representative character on the question of the reduction cf taxation,, and tho deputation, submitted the &quot;following Resolution to mo:--&quot;Resolved that this Meeting being representative of the Federation of British Indus tries.; Swansea Chamber of Commerce, Newport Chamber cf Commerce., Lv.ar.olly Chamber of Commerce, Incorporated Swansea Exchange, Welsh Plate, and Sheet Manufacturers&apos; Association, South Wales Siemens Steel Association, Incorporated Swansea and District Freighters Association, and&apos;Coal Owners&apos; Association, calls upon the Chancellor of the Exchequer to make a drastic reduction in the forthcoming Budget. The meeting is of opinion that this can best be done by taking as a minimum 2/- off the Income Tax, abolishing tho Corporation Profits Tax, and making an equitable adjustment in regard to the Super Tax on reserves of private firms.The Meeting is further of opinion that this reduction in taxation is of primary importance at tho. present time owing to tho fact that there is ample evidence that the heavy burden is crippling industry and killing enterprise and initiative and thus playing a large part in preventing the recovery and expansion of trade which can alone prove the solution of the unemployment difficulty&quot;.In view of the approaching discussion that the Cabinet must have on the Budget proposals I wish to draw tho attention of my colleagues to this resolution which is in accordance, with- 1 -
the attitude taken up toy all the business and industrial community of the country, the unanimity of which cannot be ignored.,There arc two chief points which emerged from my discussion with the Deputation and which arc generally present in the minds of the business community.     The first is that owing to the operation of the three years&apos; average of income tax many businesses,, in   order to pay Income Tax in the current financial year, have either to entrench on their capital resources toy selling securities, or have to mortgage their credit by borrowing from their cankers.     Firms which are actually making a loss and have no profits out of which to pay their taxes, have to pay taxation on account of past profits they have made, the cash resources for which no longer exist,,     This in itself&apos; creates a very serious position In some cases it will probably be found impossible to find the money;    in other cases capital which could and would be employed in industry and commerce is being withdrawn in- order to meet current taxation.     Although the situation is related to, It is not necessarily dependent on, the rate of Income Tax and in my opinion it ought to be very seriously considered whether, if a firm can prove to the Income Tax Commissioners that it is unable to pay its taxes at the present- time except by methods such as I have Indicated, the postponement of such payment over a longer period could be allowed.      I make this suggestion in spite of the Treasury argument that it make no difference to the Community whether you raise revenue by taxation or by borrowing;    an argument which I cannot accept &quot;and which,; in ray opinion, is entirely fallacious for the following reasons:-Whereas it is quite true that money raised either through taxation or as loans comes /cut cf the pockets of &apos; the Nationals of that State/ it must be remembered. firstly,
that it does no., necessarily come out of the same pockets, and t/horeas taxation may deprive an individual   member of the community of money which ho requires either for maintaining his standard of living or for purposes of business, borrowing draws money from an individual who has surplus funds at his disposal on which he vfishes to find some ret\irn.     It is not true that the amount available for private trade and industry is not affected by the manner in whicth State money is found * The class of investor who requires Government securities is not of the same character as the class of investor who provides money for trade and industry *     It is a well known fact to those dealing with investments that they are an entirely different category of persons.     Whereas taxation ind is or imi nat e ly w i t hcl r aw s money from both classes , t he issue cf Government securities has not this effect.Secondly, as taxation deprives the individuals either of their cash resources or of credit, the person re-ceiving Government securities for his money has the credit created for him almost to the extent of his loana     It was this fact that enabled large loans to be raised during the War when many individuals subscribed very big sums on the credit of the securities they received as well as on their personal credit.It surely cannot be contended that it does not damage business enterprise far more for those who are engaged In it to have to weaken their capital or credit position than it damages the State to use the general credits of the community&apos;by way of borrowing to meet State obligations. Technically no doubt there will be considerable difficulty in meeting such cases and also a possible risk of a certain amount of revenue not being recovered although I do not think
such difficulties are insurmountable If the policy is decided on;    but the position Is so exceptional that we should not allow ourselves to be turned from a sound policy for this reason.The second point which emerged from my discussion with the deputation is the reduction of Income Tax per se.     The Idea expressed in the Resolution Is firmly Implanted, in the minds of every business man and no amount of theoretical argumentation will affect the simple fact that it is Impossible to get men to risk their money In commercial enterprise if the loss entirely falls on them, and so large a share of any possible profits which they may make is taken away from them in taxation.     It is a well recognised canon of taxation that whereas up to a certain point taxation   may stimulate enterprise by calling forth greater efforts In order to meet it and to maintain the standard of living in the community, there is a point at which taxation becomes top burdensome and depresses enterprise to such an extent that its very weight far from producing, diminishes revenue.     In my opinion the present Income Tax is having this very effect.     It is a   psychological fact, as well as an economic one.     Mo one can estimate the loss to the Industrial and trading community involved by the de-energising of those elements on whose enterprise,  efforts and. endeavours, the fabric of our commerce really depends.I therefore cannot agree with the able memoranda corn-piled by the Controller of Finance, a copy of which the Chancellor of the Exchequer has been kind, enough to send to me. While his general propositions would certainly be accepted as sound, he does not seem to have addressed his  mind to the question of the effect on the country of endeavouring to deal immediately with the heavy burdens placed upon It as a legacy of the War,     The idea that the annual expenditure should be met out of annual revenue surely implies that such expenditure&apos; is of a normal character;   but no one year or even a few years
must necessarily bear the repayment of liabilities accumulated during such an abnormal period as we have passed through.     This country has already done more in that direction than any other country I believe in the world, and in my opinion some of the heavy trade depression and unemployment we now see is partly due to the effort demanded by the levying of taxes beyond the capacity of the country to bearo     While it may have been permissible while trade was good it is certainly quite unsound when we are   going through an   unexampled trade depression.No account whatever seems to be taken of the heavy burden involved on the community by unemployment.     The direct and Indirect expenditure in taxes and rate-contributions of employers and employed for carrying l - millions of Unemployed cannot be estimated at much lees than^S million per week or  150 million per yearu     This money, too., in whatever ?fay it is found, comes cut of the pockets of the community and must be borne L:i mind when we are considering the balances of the National Budget, quite apart from the question of the demoralisation of our working classes affecting their subsequent capacity for prod-action when trade improves.It has been suggested that it would be better at this time to proceed on the lines of balancing the Budget and providing a sinking fund for debt,, and to wait for several years for a trade revival and then to oommer.ee tc reduce -taxation -rather than to reduce taxation at once to bring about a trade revival which it is assumed will then be checked by the reimposition of taxes which had been taken off *     I cannot agree, for the following reasons(1) the trade revival will probably not take place because of the heavy taxation imposedJ (2) the demoralising and depressing effect of the long trade depressions both on employers and, employed is cumulative.
It is easier for people to grapple with difficulties if there is an occasional respite.       Traders are used to tips and downs&apos; in business and what is discouraging thfc.a Is the apparent hopelessness of any Improvements,     It may be argued that alleviation in taxation Is not a sufficiently important factor to produce any visible change In the conditions of industry or serious diminution in the volume of unemployment:     it Is, of course, impossible to dogmatise upon such a highly hypothetical situation;   but the universal view of those engaged in industry is that it would give a very marked stimulus to industry.     It Is Impossible to ignore this widespread feeling, which I personally share.The material upon which one could suggest usefully either the amount of taxation that could he reduced or the methods which would have to be employed to produce the sums requisite Is not at my disposal.     If thia principle of , reduced taxation is adopted I should not hesitate myself to adopt the expedient which under ordinary circumstances might be looked upon as of doubtful financial soundness, and in this matter I feel sure we should not, be guided too much either by pure theory or by the advice of financiers;   both are apt to regard, this question too little from the general point of view *f the welfare of the nation and too much from the point of view of their own particular angle of vision,a. mm).30th March, 1922,Ministry of Health.
