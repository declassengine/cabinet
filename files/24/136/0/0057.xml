this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S GOVERNMENT.CABINET. TRADE BOARDS - REPORT OF LORD OAVE&apos;S COMMITTEE OP ENQUIRY. MEMORANDUM BY THE MINISTER OF LABOUR.SECRET.C.P. Ab tho Cabinet are aware the Committee appointed3956.under the Chairmanship of Lord Cave to enquire into the Trade Board eyetem has now reported.*The general effect of tho Report is to declare that tho Trade Boards in general have fully justified their oxiatence and ohould be continued.     Attention, however, ia drawn to oertain defects in the ayetem which, in tho Committee&apos;a view, should be immediately remedied.The major defects as sot out by the Cave Committeeare -(a) a general want of elasticity and adaptability in the working of the Boards as a result of which rates cannot be altered with sufficient apeed to suit changing circumstances;(b) a tendency on the part of tho Boards to departfrom their original function of protecting workers jl against sweating and to become wage-regulating authorities; and(c) a tendency on the part of the Boards to ignore apodal local ciroumetancoa and local neede through,) the failure to establish local maohlnery.The recommendations mado by the Committee would cure the first defect by drastically reducing the timo required to mako changee; would cure the second defect by radically roduoing tho powers of the Boards In raapect of compulsory ratea, and would euro the third defect by giving the minister- 1. -* The Committee1a summary of their reoommendatlona is ahown in the annexed Appendix.
of Labour power to establish district machinery at his discretion and not as now at the discretion of the Boards.Those are the main changes proposed by the Committee though there aro a*numbor of others of a minor character which aro for the most part usoful and not unimportant.     I have never doubted that the principle underlying the Trade Boards Acts, namely, that of protection of tho sweated worker unable to protect him or herself is right.     I had doubted in tho months preceding the appointment of tho Committee whether this principle was not being endangered by extension to wider fiolds of wage regulation, and I am, therefore, entirely in favour of the recommendations of tho Committee. If those aro adopted, they would, in my view, remove the large volume of criticism and grievance under which tho Acts had laboured, and would re-establish the Trade Board thoy ought to bo re-established, in a firm and a permanent position as the Stato means of preventing sweating.To effect these changes legislation would be necessary, and if it is deferred tho Trade Board system will, in my view undoubtedly suffer severe damage, which might thon be laid at the door of the Government.     I therefore ask leave from the Cabinet to introduce as soon as possible, a Bill broadly giving effect to the recommendations of the Cave Committee with such minor alterations as may be required, and furthor I ask that Parliamentary time may bo given to secure the passage of the Bill during the present Session of Parliament.(Signed) .
