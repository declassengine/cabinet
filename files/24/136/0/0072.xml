!H&apos;IS DOCUMENT 13&apos; TH\,:ROPSRTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJBSTYjg Ggovmmmt )414C A. B I N committee OF HOIVIS AFFAIRSE 0 3 F T.n/P.39,71.SOLICITORS BILL,  1922,Memorandum by the President.&apos; Board of Education.1.    The general object of this Bill i3 to improve the arrangements under whioh a person who desires to qualify as a solicitor obtains his education.     The Bill has .been prepared in close consultation with and largely at the suggestion of the Law Society who strongly support it and it is believed that it will be generally welcome to the solicitors&apos; profession.   It was prepared on the instructions of the Lord Chancellor : &quot;who is anxious that it should be passed as soon as possible, and has the support of the Board of Education.   I append a brief description of the contents. , -ay 15,- 1922. -2.    Clause 1.       A person desiring to become a solicitor must usually under the Solicitors Aot, 1877, before becoming bound under AT tides of Clerkship, pass a preliminary exainina-tion in general knowledge.       Under Section 10 of that Act   -intending Solicitors are exempt from this preliminary examination if thoy have passed oertain other examinations which are mentioned in the section or which can be added to the list of approved examinations by regulations made under the section. The list of examinations contained in the section i3 obsolete. It includes examinations which should no longer bo included and omits to refer to Universities which have come into existence since the Act of 1877 was ^passed.     Nearly all professions require proof that tho entrant has passed an examination in general knowledge and quito reoently there has been a general oonsensus as to what examinations ohould be required.       It is therefore proposed to repeal Section 10 of the solicitors &amp;ct 1077 and to provide that in future certain specified examinations mentioned in the Bill should
exempt the intending articled olork from tha preliminary examination and that tho Board of Sduoation should have-power in eonault&amp;tion with the Law Society and oortain high Judicial Authorities to add to the list of exempting examinations. This clause gives sufficient elasticity and the only point of controversy with regard to it,is how soon it should he put into operation having regard to the possible vested interests of persons who have &quot;been preparing for examinations which will be in future excluded from tho list.       The Bill says two years and this will probably bo found sufficient.3*   Clause Z.     This clause is intended to secure that so&apos; far as possible solicitors should obtain their professional knowledge at a School of law.     It is agreed that at tho present time many intending solicitors are so situated that-they could not attond a School ol law, and the clause gives the Law Society a very wide power of exemption in suoh oa3os and further gives an appeal to the Master of tho Rolls against the refusal of tho Society to grant exemption.     There is no dispute as to the educational value of this clause and if any controversy were to arise it would bo as to tho sufficiency of the provisions for exemption.4-.   The other clauses of tho Bill are mainly technical and are believed to be unoontroversial.     Clause 3 of the Bill has the effect (a) of substituting for the Universities which existed in 1877 the Universities mentioned in the present Bill (see Clause 9) and also (b) of extending Section 13 of the Act of 1877 to examinations held by a University as well as to examinations held in a University.5*   Clause 4 makes the substitution of Universities which has already been mentioned under Clause 3 and also
provides that the Degree of Baohelor of Science which has come into existence since the solicitors Aot 1860 should have the same efficacy for the purpose of limiting the period of training as a solicitor as a Degree of Bachelor of Arts,6*    Clause 5 prescribes the dato at whioh a solicitor may take his Final Examination.       The alteration is really due to the fact that Section 12 of the solicitors Act 1860 which previously provided for this matter has &quot;become obsolete since the system of terms on whioh it is based has become obsolete.7&apos;    Clause 6.     A solicitor before he can practice requires (a) to be admittod and (b) to obtain a certificate authorising him to praotioe.     Under the existing law the latter certificate may in certain cases be refused by the Registrar subject to an appeal to the Master of the Rolls if a solicitor allows his certificate to practice to lapse for a period of 12 months.     The present clause deals with two similar cases, first the case of a man who does not apply for his first certificate till more than 12 months after admission, and secondly the case of a man who at the dato of his application for his first certificate is an undischarged bankrupt.8.    Clause 7 confers a power to make regulations for the purpose of the Solicitors Act 1888.     This power was contained in Section 15 of the Solicitors Act 1888, but probably owing to an oversight the section was repealed by the Solicitors Act 1919.9.    Clause 8.     This clause raises the fee for the Registrar&apos;s Certificate of Practice from 5/- to  1 and provides that the increase shall be applied for the purpose of legal education.10.    Clause 9 defines Universities and enables the Bill to be extended to new Universities.
