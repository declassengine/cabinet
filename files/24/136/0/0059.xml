May 1922.      ,,- fw fxSECRET.CP. 3958.CABINET.SPECIAL EEPORT ON UNEMPLOYMENT.No. 65.WEEK ENDED APRIL 28, 1922.THE  SITUATION.The dispute in the engineering and shipbuilding trades is exercising an adverse effect not only on the prospects of the two industries concerned but on industry generally, and may be regarded as having definitely put back the improvement which was anticipated in most parts of the country.In coal-mining, there has been a slight set-back, notably in the North-Western Division and in Scotland, but reabsorption continues in Wales, and considerable improvement has taken place in the North and North-East of England.In the iron and steel industry the tone is varied. There is some improvement in Wales and the North of England, but heavy discharges have taken place in the Midlands.In the chemical industry in South Wales the men have returned to work pending a settlement of the trade dispute, which has been in progress for a considerable period.Generally speaking, the engineering and shipbuilding industries are at present dormant, and it is reported that an increasing amount of repair work is being sent to the Continent. The only section of the engineering industry which shows signs of activity is motor engineering, and this activity is mainly confined to the Midlands.In the cotton industry, negotiations have been proceeding between employers and workpeople on the question of wages, and a provisional settlement has been arrived at. Recovery in this trade continues to make very slow progress, and short-time is generally the rule, although extra machinery is being brought into use ir. anticipation of increased business.In the hosiery and woollen trades the position is fairly good, and there has been improvement in boot and shoe manufacture. Orders for jute have decreased, and additional unemployment has resulted.In the plain net and cotton section of the lace industry further improvement is reported. In the clothing and kindred trades the improvement already noticed continues, but building is not quite so good, and the activity anticipated round about the Easter holidays did not materialise.T. J. MACNAMARA,Ministry of Labour,

SUMMARY OF ACTION TAKEN BY THE GOVERNMENT.[From Autumn 1920 onwards.] Cabinet Unemployment Committee.The prospect of a severe trade depression first became evident in the early autumn of 1920. On the 13th August, 1920, there was a special discussion at a meeting of the Cabinet, when the Cabinet Unemployment Committee was appointed to consider the whole question and devise means for relieving unemployment.(A.) Unemployment Insurance.An Unemployment Insurance Act of general scope came into operation on the 8th November, 1920. The Act applied compulsory insurance against unemployment to 12,000,000 persons as compared with 4,000,000 previously. Subsequent amending Acts modified the conditions as regards rates of benefit, extended the periods of benefit and increased the contributions. As from November 1921 the Unemployed Workers&apos; Dependants&apos; (Temporary Provision) Act, 1921, made temporary provision for grants in respect of wives, dependent husbands and children, and imposed a special levy to provide for these grants. The Unemployment Insurance Act, 1922, which operates as from the 6th April, 1922, amalgamates the dependants&apos; grants with Unemployment Benefit, and the special levy with the Unemployment Insurance contributions, and extends until June 1923 the special periods during which &quot; uncovenanted &quot; benefit may be drawn. The authority to borrow money from the Treasury is increased to  30,000,000 for Great Britain.Table showing amount paid out in Unemployment Benefit (including Benefit in respect of Dependants) and the Contributions during the period November 8, 1920, to April 22, 1922.Unemployment benefit and dependants&apos; benefit paid Contributions from EmployersEmployed personsState       ... .......State (in respect of benefit for ex-regular sailors, soldiers and airmen)Balance of benefit paid over contributions (pro-vided mainly out of the accumulated reserve fund of over 20 millions and advances by the Treasury amounting to  14,960,000) 78,982,00017,648,000 16,162,000 10,181,0001,686,00045,677,00033,305,000
(B.) Emergency Works and other Measures.A full statement of the measures taken in the autumn of 1920 and of the later measures from autumn 1921 onwards has been set out in previous issues of this Report. At least 250,000 men have had employment on these schemes at various times, and at the present time over 134,000 men are employed, exclusive of the work provided for men in ancillary occupations and the effect of the Export Credits and Trade Facilities Act schemes (see table below).SUMMARY SHOWING THE LABOUR EMPLOYED AT APRIL 21, 1922, ON CERTAIN OF THE SCHEMES REFERRED TO ABOVE.Scheme.
