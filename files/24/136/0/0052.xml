REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE TO CONSIDER TERMS TO BE OFFERED TO OFFICERS AND OTHER RANKS OF THE FIGHTING SERVICES SURPLUS TO ESTABLISHMENT.AT the meeting of the Cabinet 15 (22) held on Monday, the 6th March, 1922, it was decided That a Committee should be appointed to advise as to the special terms to be offered to officers and other ranks of the Navy, Army, Indian Army and Air Force who are surplus to the approved establishment of those services.The following were appointed members of the Committee: The Right Hon. Stanley Baldwin, M.P., President of the Board of Trade (Chairman).The Right Hon. Lord Goreli, C.B.E., M.C., Under-Secretary of State for Air.Mr. L. S. Amery, M.P., Parliamentary and Financial Secretary, Board of Admiralty.Lieutenant-Colonel the Hon. G. F. Stanley, C.M.G., M.P., FinancialSecretary, War Office. Sir William Duke, G.C.I.E., K.C.S.I., Under-Secretary of State, IndiaOffice.&apos;Mr. E. Hilton Young, D.S.O., D.S.C., M.P., Financial Secretary, Treasury.Lieutenant-Colonel Sir John R. Chancellor, K.C.M.G., D.S.O., (Secretary).Major L. A. Clemens, O.B.E., M.C. (Assistant Secretary).REPORT.1. In considering the proposals that have been submitted to us by the Admiralty, War Office, India Office and Air Ministry, we have adopted three main principles: (a.) That in addition to the pension or gratuity to which officers would be entitled for voluntary retirement, a compensation element should be added to compensate for the loss of career, and that that element should be calculated on as generous a scale as is compatible with the financial condition of the country.(&amp;.) That the services should be treated with equal generosity in order that invidious comparisons may be avoided.(c.) That the treatment accorded to &quot; other ranks &quot; should be no less generous than that accorded to officers.We are in agreement that the terms which we recommend should be considered final; and that where, as in the case of some classes of the Navy, it is proposed that a beginning should be made with the scheme of retirement on a voluntary basis, in case sufficient retirements are not obtained by that means, the Department concerned must be prepared to obtain the number required under the scheme by earmarking or other compulsory measures.2. At our first meeting the Under-Secretary of State for Air informed the Committee that, as far as the Royal Air Force was concerned, no special terms would be required. The surplus officers and other ranks of the Air Force were all serving on short engagements. The Air Ministry proposed to dispense with their services under the normal procedure at the conclusion of their present engagements. We do not, therefore, make any recommendations in regard to that service.3. In the course of our deliberations the question arose as to whether the numbers of years&apos; service or the ages of the officers should be adopted as the basis for comparison in fixing the terms to be granted to the Navy and Army.
4. On the basis of age the rates proposed for naval officers would at first sight appear to be considerably higher than those proposed for officers of the Army and Indian Army. It must be remembered, however, that, in comparing the position of officers in the Army and Navy, age does not afford a fair basis of comparison for the following reasons : (1.) The statutory rights of the officers in the Navy and Army differ considerably.(2.) The normal rates of pay and pension in the Navy are higher, age for age,than in the Army and Indian Army. (3.) Naval officers join the service much younger than officers of the Army,and accordingly have more years&apos; service to their credit than army officers of the same age.On the other hand, to allow naval officers to count for pension and gratuity the whole of their sea service under the age of 20 would be hardly equitable to military officers. In the following recommendations we have endeavoured to grant equal treatment to the two services, giving due regard to the considerations enumerated above.5. With regard to the naval ratings, our proposals are briefly as follows: (a.) Men with over 12 years&apos; pensionable service to receive the proportionate amount of pension to which they are entitled plus an addition of 2 years to their service to count for pension and a gratuity equal to the difference between their substantive pay at the current rate for 21 months after discharge and the basic rate of pension for the same period.Note. The addition of 2 years to service to count for pension is a . varying one according to length of service.   A rating with 20 years&apos; pensionable service  counts the full addition of 2 years, then the addition follows a descending scale.   For actual rates see page 8.(b.) Men with between 5 and 12 years&apos; pensionable service to receive a bonus calculated on a sliding scale ranging from 6 months&apos; substantive pay in the case of men with 5 years&apos; service to 24 months&apos; substantive pay in the case of men with 11 years&apos; service ; the bonus increasing by 3 months&apos; substantive pay for each additional year of service.(c.) Men with under 5 years&apos; pensionable service to be granted free discharge plus a bonus of  20 to compensate for the loss of unemployment benefit.6. The terms proposed for other ranks of the Army who are compulsorily discharged or transferred to the Reserve are calculated on the length of the unexpired portion of a mails current engagement at the time of his discharge, and are set out in detail in Appendix II (B) to this report.It has been explained to us that the reductions in the other ranks of the Army can be effected without causing the discharge of any appreciable number of men, serving for pension, who have not completed 21 years&apos; service. If any such men have to be compulsorily discharged, they should receive the full pensions to which they are entitled under the pay warrant, based on past service in addition to the benefits, based on unexpired service, applicable under Appendix II (B).7. We have been unable to come to an agreement with regard to the amount of compensation to be given to other ranks of the Army who decline to accept transfer to another unit and elect to take their discharge. It was explained to us that infantry soldiers enlist for service in a definite regiment, and that the Army Council have no power to transfer them against their will to another unit. The War Office proposed that such men should receive half the benefits given to men who are compulsorily discharged. On the other hand, it was urged that as those men were being offered opportunities of completing their period of service with the colours they were not entitled to receive any compensation if they declined that offer.The position was further complicated by the fact that men of Irish regiments who refused transfer to British regiments and elected to take their discharge [8307] B 2
might suffer considerable hardship, since it would be unsafe for them under existing conditions to return to Ireland.As we are unable to make a unanimous recommendation on this point, we have left it to be decided by the Cabinet.8. The numbers of surplus officers and other ranks to be disposed of are approximately as follows : -	Officers.	Other Ranks.Navy (including Royal Marines)	1,835	15,335Army	1,500-1,600	34,000Indian Army	2,000-2,400	Nil &quot;Air Force                      ..         ..	250	2,000Total	5,577-6,077	51,3359. The terms which we recommend to be offered to the various ranks of the three services are set forth in Appendices I, II and III to this report. 10. The total estimated cost of these proposals will be as follows: 	Officers.		Other Ranks.		Pensions.	Gratuities.	Pensions.

Navy.(A.) Terms Proposed for Officers.1. Captains (Executive).Numbers for disposal, 119.A number of captains who may be regarded as the least suitable for retention to be selected by the Admiralty and to be definitely informed that .no further employment will be given to them, and it will be open to them to retire within 6 months of receiving the Admiralty notification on the following scale of pension: (a.)  800 for captains of 6 years&apos; seniority and upwards, with qualifying servioe for promotion as laid down in article 263, King&apos;s Regulations and Admiralty instructions.(&amp;.)  700 for captains of 3 years&apos; seniority and upwards without qualifying service.(c.) For captains of less than 3 years&apos; seniority, the rate of retired pay for which they are eligible under the ordinary regulations with retired pay of  100 a year in addition.The number of years&apos; service required to qualify for pension (a) is 21 years and for pension (b) 18 years. Additions or deductions will be made to these pensions of  15 per annum for each complete year in excess or short of the standard number of years&apos; service up to a maximum of 5 years either way.Officers retired under the scheme to be eligible to rise by seniority to the rank of rear-admiral on the Retired List, provided they had 3 years&apos; service as captain in command of a ship of war at sea.2. Commanders (Executive).Numbers for disposal, 200.(a.) Commanders qualified by age and service for the maximum rate of retired pay for the rank, viz.,  600 a year, varying in age from 46 to 50 It is proposed that they should be given, in addition to the retired pay of  600 a year earned, a gratuity of  250 for each complete year they are short of 50, with an addition of  62 10s. for each complete 3 months of an uncompleted year, subject to a maximum gratuity of  750 in each case.(h.) Commanders of seniorities 1915 to 1919 inclusive, in which years the congestion is greatest, to be offered voluntary retirement with retired pay of  100 a year in addition to the rate of retired pay earned by service, subject to the maximum rate of retired pay for the rank not being exceeded.Those officers vary in age from about 35 to 41, were specially selected for promotion to commander during the war, and are still in the running for promotion to captain. By retiring now, therefore, they suffer considerable loss of prospects, since even if they were not promoted they would not be due to retire until reaching the age of 50.3. Lieutenants ex Cadet (Executive). Numbers for disposal, 407.. i Hate ofRemonty- Retired Pay,      s. d.Less than I year    .. . . ..      82   10   01 year, but less than 2 .. ..      90    0   02 years,    ,,      ,,3 . . ..       97   10   08   ,, ,,      ,,    4 . . ..     105     0   0*1   ,, ,,5 .. ..     112   10   0(Acting lieutenants to be eligible on the basis of their acting seniority.)(&quot; Plus the sum of  350, with a gratuity in addition of  50 for each of the first 3 years since joining a sea-going ship, and  100 for each subsequent year. Por each 3 months of an un-cornpleted year, they will receive  25 if over 3 years&apos; service and  12 10.5., if under 3 years&apos; service.A few of these lieutenants were transferred from the R.N.R. for special service during the war. It is proposed that service for gratuity in their case should reckon from the date of their first appointment by the Admiralty to a sea-going ship as a R.N.R. officer during the war.The gratuity would vary from about  150 to  650, according to the circumstances of each case, the average being about  450.
We consider that, as in many cases a lump sum would be of more use to an officer than an annuity, special facilities should be given, at the discretion of the Admiralty and subject to the usual regulations as to medical examination, &amp;c, for the commutation of the whole of his retired pay or such part of it as the officer may wish.4.

Paymaster Commanders.Numbers for disposal, 26.As in paragraph 5, except that the gratuities of those eligible for the maximum retired pay of their rank should be calculated with reference to the dates they are due for compulsory retirement, and not on the date of reaching 50 years of age.7.

Lieutenant-Colonels and Majors, Royal Marines.Numbers for disposal: Lieutenant-colonels, 5 ; majors, 14.Lieutenant-colonels will be invited to retire on the rates of retired pay earned( by age and service, with an addition of  100 a year as a compensation element, subject to the maximum rate of  750 not being exceeded.Majors, who for purposes of pay rank with commanders, R.N., and officers of corresponding rank, will be dealt with under the arrangements proposed in paragraph 2 for commanders, viz.: (a) Majors qualified by age and service for the maximum rate of retired pay ( 600 a year), will be given in addition a gratuity of  250 for the first complete year they are short of the age for compulsory retirement and  62 10s. for each complete three months over one year, subject to a maximum gratuity of  750.Rate of Retired Fay.   160 170 180 190 200 215 227 240 252 265With a gratuity of  500 in each case.
(b.) Majors who are not so qualified will be allowed to retire on the retired pay earned by age and service, with an addition of  100 a year as compensation for loss of career subject to the maximum rate of retired pay for the &quot; rank not being exceeded.&quot;10. Captains and Lieutenants, Royal Marines (other than Officers promoted from the Ranks).Captains and lieutenants will be offered the same terms as are laid down for lieutenants cx cadet, to whom they correspond, time for gratuity reckoning from the date of first joining a seagoing ship or of being drafted to a brigade for servioe ashore. Seniority for retired pay, however, will count from the date of attaining 4 years&apos; seniority as a commissioned officer, or date of promotion to captain if earlier. These officers will not be ear-marked for retirement, since any reduction necessary can probably be effected by voluntary means, and they are not liable to retirement for non-service.11. Lieutenants and Engineer Lieutenants specially promoted ex Warrant Officer.Numbers   for   disposal :    Lieutenants   (executive),   44 ;    lieutenants (engineer), 23.These officers will be granted the maximum rate of retired pay obtainable, i.e., . 350 a year, with a gratuity of  500.12. Royal Marine Officers specially promoted from the Ranks. Numbers for disposal: Captains and lieutenants, 28.Captain Lieutenant13. Various Warrant Officer Branches.Numbers for disposal (all branches), 640.The age for compulsory retirement to be reduced to 50 in all branches in which a surplus exists.(a.) Officers over 50 years of age : To receive the rate of retired pay they would have earned on retiring at 55, with a sum in compensation for loss of full pay and allowances equal to . 150 for each complete year so lost plus  37 10s. for each complete three months of an uncompleted year.(6.) Officers under 50 years of age : To receive retired pay calculated on two years&apos; additional service, with increments according to the rank they hold when the scheme comes into force, subject to the rank maximum, plus a gratuity in compensation amounting to  500.Those with eight years&apos; service or more as warrant officer to receive the minimum pension of a commissioned officer from warrant rank, viz.,  200 per annum, and a gratuity of  500, if their records are satisfactory.General.All officers retired under these sohemes, if serving abroad, will be entitled to free passage home, and will remain on full pay until the date of their arrival in England. They will be entitled on arrival to the balance of foreign service full-pay leave due to them.In order that no officer should be at an advantage over another, or should hold back with a view to increasing his retired pay or gratuity, the rates of retired pay and gratuities, other than the gratuities mentioned in paragraphs 2 (a), 5, 8 (a) and 12 (a), should be based on the officers position on a date 3 months fromMinimum per A nnum. 300 250Addition for each Year&apos;s Service in the Rank.  106Maximum per Annum.  350 300)With a gratuity of  500 in each case.

Terms proposed for Ratings.(a.) Ratings with 12 Years&apos; Pensionable Service and Over. Pensions as follows: Men with 20 years&apos; pensionable service and over 19 and under 20 years&apos; service18 17 16 15 14 1219 18 17 16 15 14Naval Eatings	Royal MarineBasic Rate	Basic Rateper Day.	per Day.d.	s.    d.2   9*	2   7i*2   7	2   62   5	2   4i2   3	2   32   1	2   11 11	1 111   9	1   91   7	1   7Full pension.With the usual additions for C.P.O. allowance, petty time, medal and badges, viz.: Petty time, id. to \d. a day, which may be doubled. C.P.O. allowance, id. a day. Badges (up to three in number), Id. a day. Medal, 2d. a day.In addition to the above, each man will receive a gratuity equal to the difference between his substantive pay, at the current rate, for the next 21 months of his service and the basic rate of his pension for the same period. This is based on the same principle as that on which the proportionate soale of pension has been fixed, namely, that the man is entitled, in view of his long contract with the State, to a sum corresponding to a reasonably long notice, and sufficient to enable him to look round for a new opening, change his place of residence, &amp;c. In addition to the above, the usual &quot; removal&quot; expenses to be allowed to men with 20 years&apos; service and over, but not to those with under 20 years.In the case of men with less than 21 months to complete the full 22 years (21 for Royal Marines) for pension in the ordinary course, the gratuity to be based on the difference between substantive pay and the basic rate of pension for the unexpired period of service.The scales of pension not to be subject to reduction for fall in the cost of living.(b.) Ratings with Pensionable Service over 5 Years a,nd under 12 Years.Men with at least 11 years, bonus of 24 months&apos; substantive pay.,,      10 and under 11 years, bonus of 21 months&apos; substantive pay. 9        ,,      10 ,, 188 7 69 8 7 615 12 9 6
&apos;JIn calculating the amount of the bonus, the definition of &quot; months &quot; to be as in K.R. and A.I., Vol. 1, p. xiii.The terms under Section (&amp;) to be given only to those men, in the first two categories (i.e., over 10 years&apos; and under 12 years&apos; service), who would be permitted to re-engage under the terms of A.F. O. 665a.(c) Eatings with less than 5 Years&apos; Pensionable Service.Free Discharge. All men discharged under Section (c) to have a bonus of  20 (twenty pounds) to compensate them for the loss of Unemployment Benefit.Decisions on applications for discharge made after the date of the Cabinet decision on the terms to be offered will be under the new rules.In order that no man should be at an advantage over another or should hold back with a view to increasing his pension or bonus, the Admiralty propose that pensionable service should reckon up to the expiration of three months from the date of the issue of the order announcing the scheme, or the date of discharge if that is later.APPENDIX II.Army.(A.) Terms proposed for Officers.1. That the total number of regular officers in the Army be diminished to correspond with the reduced establishment by compulsorily retiring (or placing on half-pay in certain cases) the following categories of officers: a.) The relatively less efficient. (b.) The medically unfit.(c.) Those who have reached certain (temporarily) reduced age-limits (according to rank).2. That the officers disposed of under (a) and (c) be dealt with, as regards non-effective awards, as follows : An officer with 15 or more years&apos; service towards retirement to be granted, in addition to retired pay earned by rank and service, a &quot; compensation element,&quot; according to rank :  Second-Lieutenant and Lieutenant .... ....     50 a year.Captain .... .... .... .... ....     60     ,,Major  .... .... .... .... .... ....     75     ,,Lieutenant-Colonel 1.) If not in command for a definite term .... 100 ,, (2.) If in command for a term of 4 years, to be held, super-numerary on full pay and command pay for remainder of normal term of command, followed by half-pay at full-pay rate for six months (as provided for the lieutenant-colonels of the four cavalry regiments disbanded in 1921), service to end of normal term to count towards retired pay.Officers in category (b) will be disposed of under the appropriate rules for disablement awards.3. That any officer of the rank of colonel or above who, owing to abolition of his appointment, is displaced from that appointment before the end of the normal term of service in it should count as service towards retired pay, and (in the case of general officers) as service exempting from retirement for non-employment, the period he would otherwise have served in the appointment had it not been abolished. Retired pay should be subject to the normal maximum for each rank. In most cases the normal period is 4 years, but in certain cases where the appoint-ment was not a normal pre-war colonels appointment, the question of its assumed duration would have to be settled according to the circumstances of each such case.[8307] , e
On ceasing to draw full pay (including any period on full pay under Artiole 206, Pay Warrant), such an officer should be at liberty either (a.) To retire at once with retired pay calculated on his actual service plus service &apos; imputed) up to the normal termination of his appointment (or normal age limit) or (6.) To remain on half-pay, such time on half-pay to count as above; an officer electing this course should be at liberty to retire at any time before the date of normal termination of his appointment, on the special terms. If re-employed before such date, he would start counting service again in the ordinary course.4. An officer with less than fifteen years&apos; service towards retirement to be retired on a gratuity on the scale laid down in column 5 of the attached table, with the provisos (1.) That an officer with thirteen or fourteen years&apos; service be allowed to elect the terms of the pay warrant (half-pay for five years, followed by retired pay) if he prefers that course to a gratuity on the scale proposed.(2.) That an officer commissioned from the ranks and otherwise entitled to a gratuity (under Article 572 A, Pay Warrant, as amended) receive either a gratuity as in column 5 of the attached table or a gratuity of amount in column 3 plus gratuity to which he is entitled under Article 572 A, whichever is more favourable.Table to Appendix II.1 Rank.	2 Total Actual Commissioned Service.	3 Present Value 5 years&apos; Half-Pay &quot; Rounded Up&quot; to next even Hundred.	4 Gratuity of  100 for each Complete Year of Service.	5 Total Gratuity on Retirement.

In the Indian Army the surplus only exists in junior ranks, and, in selecting officers for retirement, it is intended to deal only with those whose date of first commission for the purpose of Indian Army promotion falls between the 1st January, 1915, and the 31st December, 1918.2. The terms proposed for the officers selected for retirement are : (a.) A Gratuity For subalterns of  850, with an increment at the rate of  75 a year for service in the rank of second lieutenant or lieutenant, with an addition at the rate of  60 a year for service which, under Indian regulations, counts for pension, but not for promotion ;For captains of  1,250, with an increment at the rate of  150 a year for service as captain.(5.) If the officers elect to defer the drawing of the full gratuity, an allowance at the rate of  200 a year if single, or  300 a year if married, to be issuable up to any date within three years from the date of retirement, on which the full gratuity is drawn ; an officer to be allowed, while in receipt of the allowance, to draw an advance up to 15 per cent, of the gratuity if single and up to 20 per cent, if married, without prejudice to the allowance.3. It is recommended that the compensation be given partly in the form of an allowance and partly as gratuity, the total compensation being practically unchanged.   The allowance has two advantages : (a.) It gives an officer an inducement to prepare himself for a new career before he finally commits himself to it by sinking his gratuity in it.(o.) It would relieve the State of the difficulty of providing funds for the full compensation immediately.
4. The rates proposed for officers of the Indian Army are approximately 18 per cent, higher than those proposed for officers of corresponding rank and service in the British service for the following reasons:  (a.) The financial rewards of a career in the Indian Army are greater than those of a career in the Royal Navy or British Army. The advantages of the higher pay and pensions and the time scale for promotion in the Indian Army are well recognised. The average pension is 33 per cent, higher in the case of officers of the Indian Army than of those in the British service.(&amp;.) There is nothing in Indian regulations corresponding to the provisions of articles 308 and 548 of the Royal &quot;Warrant for Pay which enable the Army Council to place an officer for whom no employment exists on the half-pay list for a period of five years, at the end of which time his claims cease, unless he has the minimum qualifying service for retired pay. The rights of officers in the Indian service are not, therefore, so restricted as those of the British service, and it is possible that they might be able to establish a claim under paragraph 722, Army Regulations (India), Vol. 1, to half-pay for life. To cover the com-pulsory retirement of the surplus Indian Army officers in question, it will be desirable to obtain a special Royal Warrant, and it is considered necessary in carrying out retirements under a warrant which possibly deprives officers of existing rights to give reasonably generous terms which may be somewhat more favourable than would have been necessary if the above-quoted articles of the Pay Warrant had their counterpart in Indian regulations.(c.) The claim of a large number of surplus officers to a permanent career in the Indian Army is exceptionally strong for another reason. At a certain period of recruitment it was found impossible to get on a temporary commission the officers urgently required for the Indian Army. In the face of refusals to accept temporary commissions, it was decided, with the concurrence of the War Office, to offer them permanent commissions. It is not unlikely, therefore, that the Government of India may have to answer a charge of breach of faith from a number of officers.A tabular statement is attached showing how the proposed scale of gratuities would apply to officers of different ranks and periods of service, and how the value of the compensation would be enhanced by the proposed allowance, on the assumption that the average allowance would be drawn for 1J years and that one-fifth of the officers concerned are married.
