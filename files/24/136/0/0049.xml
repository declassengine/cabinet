his document Is the property of Hie Britannic Majesty^ Government.CABINETSOCIALIST AND REVOLUTIONARY SCHOOLS. Memorandum by the Home Secretary.In view of the press comments and Parliamentary Questions on the subject of &quot;Socialist&quot; and &quot;Proletarian&quot; Sunday Schools, I circulate for the information of the Cabinet the following summary of the information in my possession on this subjeot.Labour and Revolutionary Schools may be divided into three sections -I.    Socialist Sunday Sobool  II.   Proletarian Schools. III.   Young Communist League Schools.I. SOCIALIST SUNDAY SCHOOLS date from 1892 when the first was started in Battersea: they are generally run on orthodox lines: in a few cases, however, they have been captured by the revolutionary element.    The.present controlling body is the National Council of British Socialist Sunday School Unions.There are at present about 120 Sunday Scheole scattered throughout the. industrial districts of England and Scotland. About 9,000 children probably attend these schools and are always much in evidence at labour festivals, particularly May-day demonstrations.The ten socialist Sunday School maxims are:-. 1.   &quot;Love your schoolfellows, who will become your fellow workers and companions in life.2,     Love learning,, which is the food of the mind. Be as grateful to your teachers as to your parents.3.     Make every, day holy by good and useful deeds and kindly actions.&amp;ST.rP.39 48.
,.\   - &apos;..4. &apos;    Ho.no.ur, good people,: : Be courteous, - and respect all; bow down to non;,5.     Do not hate or speak &quot;-evil of anyone.   Do not be revengeful, but. stand up for your rights, and resist oppression. -6.     Do rot-be ^cowardly.   Be a friend to the weak, and love justice.7.     Remember, that all the good things of the earth are produced by labour;   whoever enjoys them without working for them&apos; 1b &quot;stealing the bread of the workers.6.     Observe and thinkj in order to discover the truth. Do not believe what is&apos; contrary to reason, and never deceive yourself or others.9. Do not think that he who loves his own country must hate and despise other nations^ or Wish for war, whioh is a remnant Of barbarism,10,     Look forward to the day when all nations shall live fraternally together in peaoe and righteousness.&quot;Ih connection with this movement there is a magazineentitled, &quot;The Young Socialist - A Magazine of Justice and Love&quot;and a hymnbook containing verses by William Morris, Dr. StopfordBrooke, Bruoe Glaeier, Havelock Ellis, Edward Carpenter,Mrs. Bland, and others.It, &apos;        THE PROLETARIAN SCHOOL MOVEMENT, was instituted in 1918and controlled by Tom Anderson.    At the first Annual Conferencein April 1920 it was decided that the objective of the movementshould bet- &apos; -&apos; &apos;&apos;    ,, &apos;,&quot;To teach the children of the .working class the absolute necessity for the abolition o&apos;f&apos;v&apos;the present Political State and the inauguration of a Socialist Industrial Republio, through the Dictatorship of the Proletariat&quot;.The organ was, &quot;Red Dawn&quot;, but tliiB has ceased publicationsince the &quot;Young Communist League&quot; partially absorbed the &quot;&quot; &apos;&quot; schools.   Tom Anderson drew up the following &quot;Ten ProletarianMaxims&quot;, which were the basis of teaching in these schools f-1.    &quot;Thou shalt inscribe on your banner&apos;, &quot;Workers of all&apos; lands unite.   You ..have rx? thing to lo se, but. yOur chains!    you have a world to win&quot;&apos;.        &apos; -1 .&apos;,  f2.     Thou shalt not be a patriot, for a patriot,is an. &apos; -international&apos; blacklego : &apos;YOur du y &apos; to yourself&apos; and your&apos;: class; demands that you be a citizen of the world.&apos;-
3.     Thou shalt not usurp the right of any man or woman, nor shall you claim for yourself any natural advantage over your fellows, for every man and woman has an equal right to an equal share in the product of their collective labour.4.     Thou shalt not take part in any bourgeois war, for all modern wars are the result of the clash of economlo interests, and your duty as an internation-alist is to wage olasa-war against all suoh wars.5.     Thou shalt teach Revolution, for revolution means the abolition of the present Political State, and the end of Capitalism, and the raising in their plaoe an industrial Republic6.     Thou shalt demand on behalf of your class, the complete surrender of the capitalist class and all the means of production, distribution, and exchange, with the land and all that it contains, and by so doing you shall abolish class rule.7.     Thou shalt wage the class war, by pointing out that the hiBtory of all recorded societies is an history of the Class Struggle, and that the emancipation of the working class from wage-slavery must be brought about by themselves.8.     Thou shalt take part at all times in the political and eoonomlo struggles of the working class.   Thou shalt renounce craft unionism,; and work for the organisation of the working class into one vast industrial union, to take and hold the means of life. .9.     Thou shalt perform.a mission in society byachieving an ideal of a fuller and higher life for all, in the abolition of classes, and by the regulation of industry by the Industrial Republic which shall end the Political State.10.     Thou ehalt remember that the economic structure of Society.determines the legal and political superstructure and the Social, Ethical, Religious, and intellectual life-process in-general.   It is not farmers*b consciousness which determines their life? oh the contrary, it is the social life which determines their consciousness.will. . THE YOUNG COMMUNIST LEAGUE.In 1919 Russian bolsheviks conceived the idea of forming a &quot;Young Communist International&apos;&apos; J   &quot;World Congresses&quot; were held in Moscow in 1920 and 1921, and in AugUBt of the latter year the &quot;Young Communist League of Great Britain&quot; was formed! This league is under the aegiB of the British Communist Party but is mainly controlled from Berlin where there is a

BASIS OF ORGANISATION.Great Britain ahall be divided for organisational purposes into three divisions.Division No. (l) Lancashire, Yorkshire, the English Counties north of these and Scotland.Division No. (2) Wales, and the Counties ndftK^c^w $f Lancashire and Yorkshire down to and incJ.udi.ng the Counties of Gloucester shire, Warwickshire, Northamptonshire and Linoo-l-nahlre.Division     No.  (3) London, and all Counties south of Division No. 2.&quot;The following, according to a statement made by William Carroll, the general secretary, in February 1922, is the strength of the League:-LondonBirminghamCastleford LiverpoolManchesterLeeds NewcastleSheffield Barrow-in-FurneBB Universities wales scotland ** -AberdeenDundeeGreenockLei thMusselburgh Perth20 youth seotiona 5 schools1 youth section 1 school youth section youth section 1 school2 youth sections 2 schools1 youth seotion1 youth section 1 school youth section youth section youth seotions1 youth section 1 school youth section 1 school youth section 1 school youth section 1 school youth seotion 1 Bchool .1 youth Seotion 1 school250 members20 members20 memtoers 40 members50 members20 members 15 members25 members 20 members 9 members 30 members9 members 14 members20 members&quot;*The absence of Glasgow from the list is due, I understand, to the fact that the Glasgow schools are Proletarian&apos; SchoolB^controlled by Tom Anderson.
CP. 4c  17-22,Carroll added that Edinburgh, Leith and MuBeelburgh were endeavouring to form a district council and that there were schools at Lochgelly, Leven, Gowdenbeath, Kirkaldy, Durham, Dirtley, Bentley, Brighton^ Gorbale and Bridgeton.The literature of the League consists mainly of rather hectio repetitions of the dootrines that all means of production are owned by a capitalist class, that the workers are the slaves of this clase^ and that the world can only be put right by an international movement to place the mean of production in the oontrol of the workers.   The means by whioh thlB revolution is to take plaoe are only vaguely indicated, and in the literature I have seen it is doubtful whether any passage could be brought within the legal definition of Sedition1.Allegations have been made that the teaohlng in some of these schools is &quot;blasphemous&quot;. - Na doubt most of the teaohers are &quot;free thinkers&quot; (e,g. Tom Anderson advises the use of Grant Allen1 b &quot;Evolution of the Idea of God&quot; as a text book) but nothing has been brought to my notice on which a prosecution for &quot;blaspheming&quot; could properly be taken.H.
