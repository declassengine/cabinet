[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.jPrinted for the Cabinet.   April 1922.SECRET.CP. 3941.CABINET.THE IRAQ TREATY.I circulate a letter which I have received from the General Officer Commanding British Forces in Iraq.W. S. C.Colonial Office, April 18, 1922.General Headquarters,British Forces in Iraq, Dear Mr. Churchill, Baghdad, March 27, 1922.As I am starting to-morrow on my way to Basrah, you may care to have by air mail a note of remarks made to me by the Xaquib when 1 went to say good-bye to him on the 20th. Tho High Commissioner has seen a copy. The mistrust to which the Naquib refers is by no means confined to him alone. The King here is very widely regarded as a British puppet, which does not add to his prestige with certain elements in the country, though as such some of the tribes are more ready to tolerate him. I hear that there are difficulties in the way of omitting mention of the mandate in the treaty, but I think it may be accepted that a mention of it will create irritation which, as a soldier with a limited amount of force at my disposal, it would be wise to avoid.The Arabs, like all Orientals, are somewhat conceited and dislike the idea that the treaty will publish to the world the fact however true it may be that they are in leading strings. Moreover, there are some, the most talkative, who think, though they may not openly say so to the British, that they can stand alone. They seem to me to resemble a child who, in its anxiety to display its power of walking, resents the nurse taking its hand, but submits, without loss of amour-propre and possibly with some gratitude, to support exerted less ostentatiously elsewhere.On the 25th I had a full strength parade of the Royal Air Force at Baghdad. There were fifty-seven machines and a large number of officers and others present. It was a very fine, perhaps unique show, the turn out in every particular admirable, in addressing those present, I reminded them of the great task the R.A.F. here had undertaken to perform, and that if a body such as I saw before me, and whom I knew so well could not succeed, I should be surprised if any other could do so The force of the R.A.F. here is certainly a very fine one, and Borton, the group captain, every-thing one could desire. The country is quiet, except for Akwan alarms, and I see no reason why it should not remain so through the summer.Yours very sincerely,A. HAL DANE.Interview between the General Oljicer Commanding-in-Cliicf dnd the Naquib onMarch 10, 1922.The Naquib gave his views on the subject of the treaty. He said that a treaty &quot;between Great Britain and Iraq was unlike one negotiated, for instance, between Great Britain and France. In the latter case either party must keep a strict watch on its own interests which either was in a position to uphold against the other, but in the former case Great Britain was concluding a treaty with a Government which she herself had created in accordance with the lines of her own policy. On the one hand, [8256]
it was obvious that Iraq could not exist for a moment without British support, while, on the other, if Britain wished to back her own policy and bring it to success, it was obvious that it was in her interest to give Iraq all the face value she could. In order to set Iraq before the world as an independent Government, in close friendship with Great Britain, the latter should in her treaty with the daughter country deal as leniently and generously as possible, since the treaty would be the public definition of her status.The Naquib next referred to his relations with the Moslem world in India. Indian Islam, he said, did not believe that the declared British policy towards Iraq was sincere. If the formulae of the treaty did not show beyond a doubt that Britain was really desirous of establishing an independent Islamic State here, he, as a well-known supporter of the British, would suffer, and British credit&apos; with Islamic India would suffer no less. Great Britain, through the treaty which was now being-negotiated, might greatly improve her position in India, and she could have nothing to fear since Iraq was entirely dependent on her. With this in view he strongly opposed the mandate. But British authority in Iraq, which was and must long remain a very real factor, owing to the conditions which prevailed in the country, should be exercised in a considerate manner, so that in the eyes of the world the credit of Iraq should not suffer. To attain her end Britain would find that the feelings of friendship she inspired were of greater value to her than the force which she could undoubtedly use if she chose to what end ? It was undeniable that she could get all she wanted, and get it more permanently, without force.The Naquib concluded his remarks by referring to the recent Egyptian settlement and said that it encouraged Iraqis to hope that Great Britain would deal generously with their country.
