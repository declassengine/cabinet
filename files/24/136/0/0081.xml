3l/Thls document ia the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government. SECRETCoP.No*3980.0 A B I N E T THE ROYAL DOCKYARDS AM) OTHER INDUSTRIAL establishments SHMEifTS UKDER THE ADMIRALTY - PRO-POSED WAGES REDUCTIONS:Memorandum by the Plrst Lord of the Admiralty j  :The Shipbuilding Employersl Federation and the Federation of the Shipbuilding and Engineering Trades have recently agreed to substantial reductions in the wages at private shipyards of men employed on shipbuilding work.The reduction is 16/6&amp; a week in all, effected in three instalments as follows :-10/6a a week, taking effect from 29th March, 3/-     a week, taking effect from 17th May, 3/-     a week, taking effect from 7th June.There is, however, no agreement, as yot, to apply tho reduction to men in the Engineering trades.The Admiralty have now to consider what conse-quential action they ought to take.   They have had no part in any agreements between the private employers and the Trade Unions, but all the wholesale and uniform advances which were granted to the workmen in both the shipbuilding and engineering industries sinoe August 1914 have been granted to the workmen employed in the Royal Dockyards and allied Admiralty establishments.In the view of the Admiralty there would be Justification, -under present conditions, for applying the
whole reduGtlon of 16/6&amp; to all the men employed in the Royal Dockyards and other Admiralty Industrial establishments who were treated alike when the war increases were granted, and tb.8 resulting saving to Navy Votes would he  44,550.a week.    In the Royal Dockyards and Admiralty Establishments there has never been any differentiation as between workmen, according to the industries to which they might be deemed to belong; and it is of the utmost importance to maintain the equitable assessment of wages according to the relative values of the workpeople in the employment of the Admiralty in the same establishments; the relative values being those which have been commonly accepted under stable conditions.In the private trade, however, partly owing to the fact that the men in the engineering trade are at present looked out on account of a dispute on a different issue, no steps have yet been taken to apply the reduction of 16/6d a week, or any of it, to men employed on engineering work. In these circumstances, it has been represented to the Admiralty by the Ministry of labour that the application of the whole of this reduction generally in their Yards and Establishments would be held by the Trade Unions to be a case of the Government forcing the pace in wage reductions, although there is little doubt that in a comparatively short time that reduction will in faot be adopted by employers and Unions throughout the country.On the other hand, the Admiralty cannot agree to apply the reduction cf 16/6d. to those of their workmen only who might, more or less arbitrarily, be deemed to be shipbuilding workmen.    By doing so, they would be abandoning the established principle of paying wages which are equitable as between class and class in the Admiralty establishments, and would be faced with immediate and almost insuperable difficulties in connection)
with tho determination of the rates of wages applicable in different casos.   Many anomalies would be created and it might oven happen that a skilled mechanic in one department of the dockyard would be paid less wages than a labourer in another department of the same establishment.The Admiralty, therefore, do not feel justified in demanding, at once,  the full saving of  44,550 per week which in their opinion would bo reasonable, and, instead of making the reduction of 16/6d a week on the wages of their shipbuilding men only (which would save  13,000 a week), they propose to put forward an interim all round reduction, throughout their Establishments,  of 12/6d a week, to date from 4th Juno, 1928, for the acceptance of the appropriate V/hitley Industrial Counoil at an early meeting.    This would save  33, 750.a week.,It would be made perfectly clear to the Industrial Council that when the expected reduction of 16/6d a week is made by agreement between the outside engineering employers and Unions, the reduction in the Dockyard service generally will immediately be adjusted to the same amount,  seeing that the war increases were granted to all the trades outside and to the Dockyard service equally and from the same dates.The Admiralty propose,  however,  to instruct the official side of the Industrial Council that if they find it necessary, in order to obtain agreement, they may accept a reduction of not less than 10/- a week, instead of 12/6d, with a consequen-tial saving of only  27,000 per week.If these proposals are aporovod,  the Admiralty would not secure the full economy that a reduction of l6/6d a week all round would give, but would obtain a larger saving&apos;than-would
be gained by the application of the 16/6d. reduotion to shipbuilding men only, and would avoid creating difficulties in the administration of their Yards for which they could not hold themselves responsible. Moreover,  it could not reasonly be held that the Government would be forcing the hands of the Unions on behalf of the Employers.1 of 3?.Admiralty   S ,\i. 1. May 17th, 1922.
