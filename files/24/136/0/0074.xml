THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.)BEGRET. Lpo3973.CABINET. REPORT of the OXFORD and CAMBRIDGE COMMISSION. Memorandum by the President of the Board of Education^It is necessary that the Government should now make up its mind as to the course to he pursued with reference to the Report of the Royal Commission on Oxford and Cambridge universities, for questions have already been asked upon the subject in the House of Commons and Mr. Asquith has given notice of his intention of raising the question of University Reform when the University Grants come up for discussion on tho Treasury Vote, for which I understand that a day is to be given.     The Report recommends in the main two things:-(l)     a largely increased State Grant -  110,000 for eachUniversity instead of  30,000 as at present, and inaddition a lump sum for pension arrears! (2)     a number of changes to secure increased efficiency in organisation, many of which require legislation; for thispurpose a Statutory Commission is required, to alterUniversity and College Statutes and to revise Trusts.As regards (1), the position of the Government is rather difficult since (a) the sum provided in the Estimates for Grants for Universities has been reduced this year by over  200,000, and no money is consequently available at present for increasing the Grants to Oxford and Cambridge, and (b) in any case it is doubtf\il whether Parliament should give any increased grant to Oxford and Cambridge in advance of the legislation required to enable them to set their houses in order on the lines recommended by the Royal Commission.     It may be represented by determined reformers that the Statutory Commission&apos;s work should be complete before the grants a^e increased, but I think this would be unfair to the Universities,since/-1-l^!mn&apos;i^*^^l^VAW!i^J^,;&quot;^^v&apos;^Jl^.&apos;:,&apos;-wv11      &apos;J-.&quot;&apos;v&apos;,.&apos;.. i.&quot; -&apos; -nv..-E.f-----
since is might delay.an urgently needed addition to- their revenues for two years or more, and my o^n&apos;view&apos; is&apos; that the&apos; increased grants &quot;(&quot;the exact amount of these to-be determined by &apos; the University Grants Committee of.the Treasury)should&apos;be paid as soon after the sotting up of the Statutory Commission as the money - ban be found.As regards (2), my- opinion is that the sooner the Statutory Commission is set up the&apos; better and that the Bill providing for this should be passed through Parliament this- Session: the.University of London Act,  1898, suoolies a convenient -model. This. Is. a step which should secure general assent, both in Parliament.: and in the Universities.     A delicate&apos;questlohy however, arises with respect to the position of &quot;women at&apos;Cambridge and the matter is sufficiently important to engage&apos;the&quot;attention of the Cabinet,Cambridge is the only British University which has declined to.grant full membership to its women students though they are now enabled to receive titular degrees.     This&apos; was felt to be an- anomaly by the Commission, who were unanimously&apos; in favourof - the-admission of women to full participation in the life and work of the University.     The Cambridge members&apos;of the Commission,however., were of opinion that the number of. women under-graduates *Should be limited by University Statute to 500i      ;-We desire strongly&quot;they say,  &quot;that Cambridge should remain&quot; mainly and&apos; predominantly a&quot;men&quot; s-University&quot; ,      .---r,  Graham, M&apos;.P.dissented from this &quot;&quot;&apos;--limitation and in the Minority Report minuted that &quot;Parliament should -&quot;be strongly urged to pass legislation at the earliest-possible moment., granting full membership of the-University bn. equal -terms- with mento women teachers and students at Cambridge&quot;..,      This view &quot;ill&apos; -.&apos;.&apos;.certainly be pressed in the House -of Commons and by the   omen&apos;organisations all over the country  . v,. There&apos;are three possible courses open to the Government:--   . (1)     - -to introduce end pass a measure framed. with the- exclusiveobject of admitting duly qualified -&quot;omen to full member-.ship of Cambridge University; &quot;-&apos;&apos;&apos;-&quot; -&quot;-&apos;&quot;-&quot;.(2)/     .
(2)     to. direct the Statutory Commission, to carry out the general intention, of the Royal Commission in this regard;(5)     to do neither of these things taut to trust to the reformed University to carry out the change in its -own way.No doubt the Government will be pressed, by the   omen&apos;s College at Cambridge by the ?&apos;omen&apos; a Organisations all over the country, ahd by Members of Parliament acting under pressure from these Organisations to adopt either the first or the second of these courses, preferably the first.     It will be argued that this is e matter in which Parliament should have the courage of its 6--n convictions, that all the other Universities which receive grpnt from tho State do, In fact, admit women to full membership, and that in present circumstances it is impracticable to make the large Parliamentary Grants to a University which disfranchises women.     It will further be urged that since women, are entitled-to vote for the Parliamentary representatives of the University, it is absurd &quot;that they should be debarred from the right of helping to organise academic studies.     Nevertheless, though I am. personally &quot;in favour Of the change, I mn,&apos; on the whole, inclined to leave it to be carried out by a re-constituted  -University and for the following reasonsr-(l)     It is in the interest of the women themsolves and of theharmonious working of the Mixed University which willbe created that the change should be the act of theUniversity itself rather than that it should be imposedupon it from outside-. (2)     It. would be regrettable that Cambridge, which was the pioneer in. the matter of University /education for women,should be deprived of the credit of putting.a crownunon the edifice. (3)     It seems probable that the compulsory imposition, of the . .       change &quot;vould cause much resentment at Cambridge andmight prejudice the receiption of thf. other recommendationsof the Commlesion.
(4)     It seems to be highly probable that under the revised - constitution of the University, opinion favourable to the claims of women will prevail. (5)      It is more in accordance with our British tradition,as well as with ray o*m repeated declarations, that the Government should refrain as far as possible from intea faring with the autonomy of a University. (6)      There is very little substance in the financialargument, since Parliament does not refrain from voting money to Boys&apos; Schools- or- to Girls&apos; Schools, and is indeed invited by the Gomriissioners to make a grant in aid of the    emends&apos;Colleges at both Universities. Qn the other hand,  if the Bill setting up a Statutory Gommlsrion contains,  as I suggest, no direction with respect to the. enfranchisement of:-the -&quot;/omen -at Cambridge,- a Clause &quot;is sure to be moved in Committee making it an Instruction to the Coramis-sion to provide for their admission and this, if strongly pressed, might be difficult to resist.      Should such an occasion arise, I an inclined to suggest that, the Minister in charge of the Bill should indicate the grounds upon which the Government would prefer to leave the matter  or the decision of the Univer-sity but that he should announce, at the same time,  that it was not intended to put on the   i&apos;&quot;hips.(Signed)      E.A.L.FISHER.0ard of Education, S,&quot;, 15th fcay, 1922c
