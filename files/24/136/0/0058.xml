THE BOARD OF TRADE.In my Memorandum of the .30th March, 1922, on the subjeot of the Sale of Food /0*,P. 3912.7, I pointed out that certain provisions of the draft Sale of Bread Bill, then submitted, might raise Parliamentary opposition, owing to the wider reaching powers whioh they sought to confer on a Department of State, to be exercised by means of regulations,   in view of this consideration, it is now proposed to substitute a Supply of Bread and Flour Bill, the soope of which is limited to two objects t- (l) The bringing of the provisions of the existing Bread Acts as to weight Into oonformity with modern requirements, and (2) Removal of the anomalous prohibition on the uso of self-raising flour.     The latter objeot is effected by olauses 4 and 5 of the draft Bill now submitted, which ooinoide generally with the operative Claudes of the Bill already introduced by Mr, inskiu, except for an extension of powers under Clause 5.cabinet supply OF BREAD AND FLOUR BILL.(Intld.)
