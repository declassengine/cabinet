Uocurnon^ is the Property of: i i i i .J:CRE f,ATTITUDE OP ggNOH GQVSRMgg: IN EVENT OF THE FAILUKE BY GERMANY TO MEET HEP. l^PJ&amp;ATION OBLIGATIONS.CP,. 3 98 5   )JJBritish Etatassy, Paris. May 20th, 1922.His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Paris presents his compliments to His Majesty1s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and has the honour to transmit herewith translation of the undermentioned paper.No. 1215.Translation,Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Paris,   May 19th, 1922.Sir,According to the press, Mr. Kenworthy yesterday asked In the House of Commons whether the British government had received assurances that the French government would take part in a conference, the object of which would &quot;be to discuss the reparation question, before taking new military measures against Germany.Mr. Chamberlain is said to have answered in the neme of the British government, that the latter had already received from the French government after the occupation of Frankfurt clear and explicit assurances, and Mr. Chamberlain quoted the declaration, made at the time to the British government, according to which the French government, for the future, intendedonly/
only to act In agreement with their allies on all inter-allied questions raised &quot;by tlie execution of the treaty.It is unnecessary for me to remind you of the conditions in which the declaration of the French government, mentioned hy Mr. Chamberlain, were made. That declaration was made after the occupation of Frankfurt and the four other German towns, an occu-pation, which was brought about by the entry of an excessive number of German troops into the neutral zone without the prior authorization of the allied Powers and in contravention of article 43 of the treaty of Versailles,Explanations having been exchanged on the matter between the BrltiBh government and the French govern-ment, the latter, after having Justified their action and noted their entire agreement with the British government on the necessity of maintaining the unity of the Allies, not only as against Germany, but also before all the vast problems, with which the world was confronted, finally declared that &quot;in all inter-allied questions, which are raised by the execution of the treaty, the French government foresees no case, where it will not be happy, before taking action to assure itself of the consent (assentiment) of it*s allies&quot;.This declaration was confirmed, in a subsequent note and after a fresh exchange of views, in the following manner: &quot;For the future, the government of the Republic repeats, that in all inter-allied questions,which/
491which are raised by the execution of the treaty, it means to act only in agreement with it*s allies&quot;..It must here be observed that the occupation of Frankfurt was brought about by a breach on the part of Germany of a clause In the treaty of a general character and touching the interests of all the allies. The treaty of Versailles provided no special procedure in the case of a breach of the treaty of this kind, &apos; Further, the government of the Republic has always based it&apos;s right to take the measures which is, at that time, considered necessary not on any provision of the treaty of Versailles, but rather on the principles and precedents of international law.So far as the reparation question is concerned, the Peace Treaty contains special provisions, notably paragraphs 17 and 18 of annex II to part VIII of the treaty of Versailles, by which is fixed the procedure to be followed in the event of the failure of Germany to execute any of the obligations detailed in that part of the treaty.The French government intends, so far as it is concerned strictly to conform to this procedure: it accordingly awaits the announcement to each one of the interested Powers by the reparations commission of the actual failure of Germany to fulfil any of these obligations - As it has already declared, it is then ready to concert with it&apos;s allies to examine the position regarding both such measures as the reparations &apos; commission may consider it right to annex to it&apos;s report to the&apos; interested Powers and the measures tobe/
492be taken as the result of the failure of Germany to execute her obligations.Nevertheless,&apos; by the terms of paragraph 18   , the respective governments have the right to take such measures as they may consider necessitated by circum-stances.   It is here no more a question of inter-allied measures but of the dispositionsi which it is within the province of each government to decide upon for the defence of it&apos;s own interests.   Such an eventuality-, which the French government, who ardently wish for the realization of a complete agreement between all the allies, very much hopes not to see take form, is therefore completely different to the cases con-sidered in the notes exchanged between the two governments In April 1920.   The right to make use or not to make use of paragraph 18 belongs in fact to each government.   We are Justified in thinking that this opinion is fully shared by His Britannic Majestyfs Government as witnessed by the decision taken by it in October 1920 on it1s own initiative and without prior consultation with it&apos;s allies, tiiat is to say the decision to forego, bo far as it was concerned,the right accruing to it under the said paragraph 18 to seize the goods of German nationals.   That this decision produced at the time a protest on the part of the French government was due to the fact that, in so acting, the British government had publicly limited in advance the range of any sanctions which might eventually be taken, since the efficacy of..one/
493one of the means of pressure, which it was proposed to &quot;bring to hear upon Germany, had &quot;been lessened by putting an end to the possibility of concerted action by tho allies so far as the collective application of the particular measure of seizure was concerned.The French government, for it&apos;s part, has never renounced the rights, which accrue to it under the treaty and which it would have been constitutionally impossible for it to renounce without a Parliamentary vote.I have considered it necessary to recall the different elements of this question, since I felt that, in the very interests of the close understanding between the French and British government, an understanding to which the government of the Republic is closely attach-ed, it was desirable that the position of the respective governments should in this matter be very clearly defined.,I em, etc.,(signed) Poincare.Sir M. Cheetham,British Charge d&apos;Affaires,Paris.
Paragraph 18 of Annex II to part VIII of the Treaty of Versailles.The measures which the Allied and Associated Powers shall have the right to take, in case of voluntary default &quot;by Germany, and which Germany agrees not to regard as acts of war, may include economic and financial prohibitions and reprisals and in general such other measures as the respective Governments may determine to be necessary in the circumstances.
