(This Document is the Property of Hle: Britannic , Ma.;) satyrs. -Government.&apos;)CJV B I .ts S T.Copy Ho ,-4CP, 3399.The Wages Cut in the Shipbuilding industry andits application to Gbvernment Establishments .Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.The recent Agreement in the Shipbuilding industry for a reduction of wages of all work people employed in that industry, with the exception of men belonging to the Amalgamated Engineering Union, gives rise to a problem of extreme difficulty inside Government Industrial Establishments, notably the Royal Dockyards.   Aa the Admiralty have shewn in their memorandum (CP,3980) the immediate result of this Agreement ie that men of the same classification will be paid at different rates in outside industry according as they are employed in a Bhipyard or elsewhere, and that even within the same establishment work people engaged on the same duties will be paid different rates according as they belong to one Trade Union or another.   The result in outside industry will be chaos, and, aa the Admiralty indicate, the precise application of the Agreement which has been reached in the shipbuilding industry to the Royal Dockyards will result in chaos there also.   A further difficulty in applying the cutto
to Government establishments arises from the fact that with a 16/6d, reduction the remuneration of skilled tradesmen is sensibly depressed below the 1914 standard,   Tha Unions took this point in the oouree of the negotiationst and the employers&apos; answer was that the state of industry left them no alternative.   V/hat is to be the answer to the dockyard men?So far as Government establishments are concerned there appear to be four possible alternatives:-i (1) to leave the rates in these establishments untouched^ until agreement for a wages reduOtion is reached between the Engineering employers and the Amalga-mated Engineering Union: (2) to adjust the rateB in the Dockyards and similarestablishments immediately bo as, broadly, to produce the same financial saving as would accrue if the shipbuilding industry Agreement were applied precise-ly to the work people covered by that Agreement but so as at the same time to maintain unchanged the existing relativity of the various classes of dockyard work people (this means in effect an all round cut of about Gs. :   the Admiralty in their memorandum BUggest an all round cut of 10s, to 12s.6d. a week, which would produce a substantially bigger saving than the application of the 16s,6d, cut to the shipbuilding grades alone): (3) to impose the full amount of the 16s,6d, cut that has been agreed to between the employers and employed in the shipbuilding industry and to apply the same reduction to other work people in the dockyards &amp;c: (4) to apply the reduction that has been agreed to be-tween the employers and employed in the shipbuilding industry to exactly comparable grades in the dockyardsSco.
Ill4c* and to leave other rates of wages untouched until by agreement or otherwise outside industry has set the pace. Each oh.3 of these alternatives is open to objection on some ground, of other.   The policy of doing nothing at all would quickly be challeriged in the interest of the general taxpayer, who would, with difficulty be persuaded that the Government was justified in paying rates to shipwrights in the Royal Dockyards-exceeding by nb less than 16/6d per week the rate agreed to for!, similar work in private yards.        The oost to the genes-O. taxpayer of doing nothing probably fifxceeds  15,000 a week, or the beat part of  1,000,000 a year.From the point of view .of the general taxpayer the&quot; Admiralty proposal (No .2; above) might fairly be regarded as reasonable, but this proposal is open to the very serious objection that it involves a wages out for engineering tradesmen and associated labour in advance of outside Industry.     The most strenuous opposition to it would certainly be offered by the Representatives of the Amalgamated Engineering Unions who would insist first of ali that the, Government was not complying with the spirit of the fair wages Resolution of the House of Commons, and,  secondly, that they were playing the employers&apos; game. The Government have repeatedlyIn recent months declared their neutrality in negotiations for wages reductions, and I cannot but think that, whatever advantage the Admiralty proposal might present in the way of administrative convenience and general equity, it Is put oat of court by this one overriding consideration.   It seems to me all themore
moro important that nothing should be done to arouse suspicions of partisanship at this moment j for the reason that the judgment of the Court of Inquiry which has recently been Investigating the question of works management, has gone&quot; substantially against the representatives of the employees, and will be regarded in many quarters as a judgment inspired, or engineered, by Government.The third alternative which, like the Admiralty scheme, would result in. the maintenance of-existing relativities inside the dockyards etc* would immediately be challenged by the same parties on the same grounds*   It is true that in two districts, namely Belfast and Southampton, where certain employers do not belong to the ohipbuilding Employers Federation, this Is precisely the course which is being adopted;   a cut of 10/6d having been imposed in these establishments not only on men belonging to the shipbuilding trades but oh men of various classifications, notably fitters,  to whom the Agreement does riot in terms apply. I am afraidi however, that these isolated analogies would not count for much when the storm burst.From most points of view the most defensible course to adopt would be the strict application of what has been agreed to outside to the dockyards and other similarly situated Government establishments.   The adoption of this course ought to meet the views of the general taxpayer and of the shipbuilding and engineering employers.   It could not reasonably be resisted by the shipbuilding employees inside the dockyards, and for obvious reasons a decision on these lines would cause no disquiet to the engineering trades inside the dockyards.   The Admiralty say that an arrangement on
on these lines would lead to intolerable anomalies in grading.     Thiei may be admitted, but it lsat least doubtful whether other interested parties would appreciate the force of this consideration;   especially as the inconvenience and anomalies will hot be confined to Government establishments but will be suffered! by a large number dcf firms up and down the country iOn balance I feel strongly that the only possible course ia that of applying to the dockyards and similar establishments as strictly as possible the terms of the Agreement which has been reached in the shipbuilding industry.        The only question to my mind is whether wS should immediately take this course of action, or should delay action for a few days in the hope that trithiri that short period there might be some definite indication of the final upshot of the negotiations which are undoubtedly about to commence between the Engineering Employers Federation and the Amalgamated Engineering &quot;Unldtii    But even so, two or three months might easily run before a cut In thS engineering trades became&quot;^ fait accomplii     I suggest^ therefore, that the right plan for the Government is at once, to begin to ehter into negotiation on the Shipbuilding Trades Joint Council for a reduction of wages on the same lines, and so far as possible within precisely the same limits, as the reduction agreed upon in the shipbuilding Industry.      In the nature of things, negotiation on the Shipbuilding Trades Joint Council will not be over and done with in a moment, and it may easily happen that by the time a decision is reached the situation may have become clear and that after all an arrangement for an all round cut may be possible.R .
