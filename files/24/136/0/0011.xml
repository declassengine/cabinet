IS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT,BRET. P73S11.0 A B INETSALE OF FOOD.4ifMemorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.On the 27th October, 1921, the Hoae Affairs Committee oonsidered the Sale of Food Order and decided that so much thereof as related to the sale of Bread by even weight, the sale of Tea by net weight, and the labelling of oertain Imported foodstuffs, should be reserved for further consideration-tion.   It was further agreed that I should submit a memorandum for the consideration of. the Committee, showing what legisla-tion would be required to amend the Bread Aots of 1822 and 1836, so as to bring them into conformity with modern requirements.Since that decision Mr. dynes has on several oooasione enquired whether, in view of the pledge given by the Government during the period of food control, I oould give an aesuranoe that the necessary legislation to give permanent statutory effeot to the retained provisions of the Sale of Food Order would be introduced without delay.   He has been informed that the Government would consider the advisability of introducing a new Bread Act and a Bill to enforce the Sale of Tea by net weight.   As regards the labelling of imported foodstuffs, he was referred to the Merchandise Marks Amendment Bill, and it was pointed out that if this Bill beoame law the Board of Trade would be empowered, after proper enquiry, to consider applications that orders should be made as to the marking on importation and sale of foreign artioles of all kinds, including foodstuffs, in such a way as to disclose tli6ir foreign origin.
In order to avoid reference baok, I have eaused drafts to he prepared of (l) a Bill for the better protection of the public in relation to the Sale of Tea, and (2) a Bill for the better protection of the public in relation to the Sale of Bread, and I now submit1 them for the consideration of the Committee.   As Mr. inskip has already introduood a Bill to amend the existing Bread Acts, having for its purpose the removal of obsolete restrictions on self-raising flour, I-attaoh a oopy of this as well.SALE OF TEA.   The representatives of the 00-operative movement and organised workers on the Consumers1 Oounoil always attached great weight to the corresponding Pood Control Order.   Of the three branohes of the grocery trade the general grocer8 always oppose the oontlnuanoe of this restriotion. The multiple shops say that they are in the hands of the Government^ they dislike restrictions, but they have enough paakets of tea accurately weighted to last them for two months;   they claim, therefore, at least  that amount of notice of any proposed ohange In the law.   The Secretary to the Oo-operative Congress states that if theee restrictions are removed, persons dealing with Oo-operative Stores alone would be penalised to the extent of  3,500,000 a year.   He adds that it is the oustom of the 00-operatl.ve Wholesale Society to give net weight at an annual ooat to them of  400,000, whioh they are quite willing to bear bo long as they are not plaoed at a disadvantage as compared with other merchants.   If the net weight Order were terminated witiout substituted legislation other merohante would revert to their old method of gross weight whioh in many caeea meant that 11 oz. of tea were sold as 1 lb., so that the consumer loat in extreme oases 6 oz. in the lb.   Without vouohing for the aocuraoy of these figures, I am inollned to faveur the introduction of this Bill.-2-
SALE OF BREAD.   This is a more oomplioated question. The existing Bread Acts deal with two matters;- (l) Sale of bread by weight, and (2) adulteration of flour and bread. The first clause of the draft Bill seeks to perpetuate the Food Control Order which provides that a loaf must not be sold unless its weight be 1 lb, or an even number of pounds. This provision has been in force throughout Great Britain for nearly five years and in the Scottish Burghs by a slightly different method for nearly 30 years.   It will be remembered that Lord Rathoreedan&apos;s Committee unanimously recommended the continuance of this provision, whioh has secured a greater measure of protection for the public without Involving any real hardship to bakers.   The apparent hardship would no doubt, be emphasised in Parliament by representatives of the trade.Clause 3 of the Draft Bill deals with the adulteration of flour and bread and will bo defended by the Ministry of Health, whose note is attached to this memorandum.   The clause may raise considerable Parliamentary opposition owing to the wide-reaching powers which it seeks to confer on a Department of State to be exercised.by moans of regulations, but I understand that these powers might be less oppressive thantlie restrictions undor the present Bread Acts whioh in one respect at any rate have proved to be unduly rigid.This speoifio point is dealt with in Mr,Inskip&apos;s Bill whioh seeks to legalise the use of self-raising flour by Ministry of Health regulations, so that In this respect the two Bills oover the same ground.   I understand that some difficulties have arisen between the millers and the bakers as regards the eoope of olause 1 of Mr.lnekip&apos;s Bill, and that it will not go through in its present form without opposition.   At present it is held up by arrangement and the decision of the Committee as to whether the draft Bill should, or should not be proceeded with becomes a matter of some
h4&apos;urgency.   Ab there is an apparent demand for legislation bringing the Bread Acts into harmony with modern requirements, I favour the introduction of the draft Bill subject to the above observations with regard to clause 3. Resolutions in support of the Even Weight Clause have been reoeived from Local Authorities in all parts of Great Britain, including many of the principal towns, and I anticipate that strong representations will be made for the introduction of legislation continuing in Borne form the provisions of the Sale of Pood Order.(initialled) S.B.30/3/22.
ADULTERATION OF BREAD AND FLOUR. ROTE BY THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH.The existing Aots, besides regulating the sale of bread by weight, contain a number of provisions for prescribing the composition of bread and flour and preventing adultera-tion.     O^e of these provisions, which makes it an offenoeto &quot;put into any corn, meal or flour ............anyingredient or mixture whatsoever not being the real and genuine produot of the corn or grain&quot; is regarded in some quarters as prohibiting the manufacture of such articles as self-raising flour and cake mixtures(which are unobjec-tionable if properly made and sold as   such) and the manu-facturers of these articles are very apprehensive on the subject.   Apart from this, the provisions as to composition and adulteration are not of much praotioal value at the present time, since their enforcement is not entrusted to any specified persons or authorities.   In. practice, reliance is placed mainly on the Sale of Food and Drugs Aots as a safeguard against adulteration;   but these Acts are only adequate to deal with the simpler forms of adulteration in vogue at the time they were passed.   The Minister of Health considers that these Acts do not provide adequate sophistications, and if it is decided to repeal the Bread Acts, he thinks that he should have power to enable him to prohibit any practices likely to be injurious to health or nutrition in the manufacture of bread and flour.
