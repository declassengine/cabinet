THE UNSidPLaYSDOn March 20th the wholly unemployed on the live registers totalled 1,762,076, a decrease of SO,323 in the week and of over 172,00-) in the last ten weeks. Short time workers on I.fe.rch 20th numbered 236,00!) and on March 17th 139,584 men were employed on relief v/ork.Apart from their endeavours to make common cause with the engineers, the organised unemployed ar$ devoting most of &quot;their attention to the forthcoming elections of Poor Law Guardians:   they foal that if they oan secure adequate representation relief will be assured, .   Speakers in the Metropolitan area have claimed this week that the official dooision to maintain tho present rate of unemployment benefit is the result of their agitation.Reports from the provinces indicate that the; organised unemployed for the most part are confining . themselves to the two spheres of action mentioned above., .    . although in the case of the engineers they have met with . very little success except in Coventry,     On March 18th a conference of unemployed at Leeds appointed Sean     . MoLoughlin, the revolutionary Sinn Feiner, as Divisional Organiser,From information whioh I have received from the -Chief Constable of Sheffield there i3 no doubt that members of the local unemployed organisation hold very extreme views and would resort to violent methods if opportunity&apos; arose.Reports indicate that the organised unemployedare assisting members of the Amalgamated engineering union in picket work in Coventry, where public meetingsunder tho Joint ausploos of the two bodies are being , &apos;  \ &apos; ..   . held/
held:   the local unemployed havo to relinquish their tenancy of the Bathe thia week and announce their intentio of obtaining the use of the Corn Exchange &quot;by hook or crook.&quot;    My correspondent states that Jack Leckie ia mo re 8 &apos; popular with the unemployed than ia Robert Williams,&apos;.: Efono of the Communist or unemployed candidates cocureil election to the Glasgow Education Authority on March 24th. committee REVOhUTIOffARY ASPECT OF TEE .T.IQU^TRI;iL SITtMEjSThe extension of the engineers&apos; lock-out and the stoppage in the shipbuilding&apos; and ship-repairing industries have brought about a situation in which there are grave possibilities.      So far tho attitude of members of the Amalgamated Engineering Union, in,the face of strenuous Communist - propaganda has boon, on the whole, very saiisfac but in view of the widened area of the trouble,, it would be unwise to presume.that a deaf ear will continue to be turned to the extremists;   indeed, there ia a growing feeling among Trade Unionists that unless general and .drastic action be .takon by the whole labour movement there will, be. a permanent lowering of the workers&apos; standan -of living: - thia feeling is. due in some measure to the belief that the employers are out to smash trade unionism, &apos; and the attitude .of the employers, which the men say is -     . &quot;arrogant and: aggressive&quot;, has led. to bitter resentment. It la probable that as long as the locked-out engineers -receive pay from their unions they will remain fairly passive, but at the same time disruptive elements are at work on Tyneside., ..Clydeslde and in the Coventry district: the presence of Walton Newbould, Tom Clark and Helen ; Crawfurd on Tyneside last week, and of Mac Manus.and Galle.cb.er in-Coventry last week was not accidental.Apart/
Apart from the industries immediately affected, there are signs of discontent in other trades:   the mine are nursing their grievances, the railway men fear that their wages will follow the downward path of the skilled workers, and the present attitude cf the cotton operatives is that, unless the proposed reductions are considerably modified, they will striko.     It would seen; therefore, that unless the unions aro handled with considerable oare and taot, thoy will provide a fruitful field for the agitator.THE COI fflflISTSThere is little doubt that the supply of Bus3lan money for tho British Communist Party has boon severely curtailed:   there is both positive and negative evidence of this fact&apos;, .   In regard to the first tho head of the secret press in Scotland has informed the staff that -       their names have been removed from the pay sheetalthough efforts are being made, to arrange for the ; isaehinory to be available if required at a future date. -&apos;. The reduction of organisers1, weekly salaries has been maintained and Glasgow headquarters&apos; havo been informed&apos;&quot; &apos;* -    .-&apos;    .             . ,,     .-. &apos;.     ...&quot; ,*. . ......*.    .&apos;. - * * *&quot; ,.  that in future their ^weekly allowance j pr organising e3q:jen303 will bo  5.10 instead of  11^.   Cn the other hand,,  rantiq efforts are being made by King  Street , to obtain mo^y from branches;   -tho .Larcashiro division,: for instance, has been presented with a. bill for literature supplied amo,unting to  94.17,3, while Coventry, Blorcwich and -He the r fie Id branch es have bo en told, thsir. literature aooeuntg- total  49.9 i7.   There &quot;is.little probability..that.,the branches will respond i .,v.t*e those.-..imaecU3to^d.;4emand^,;./espeolaily as thoy are &apos;- .. &apos;     &apos;\&quot;- *\.. !&apos;.&apos;. * being/
(being dunned also for subscriptions and contributions tothe election fund.There- are indications not amounting as yet to evidencethat the Commission appointed by tho Conference, to which reference has been made.in the last two reports, is partly responsible for the changed fInanoial policy of the party.Tho Commission has been sitting this week and it i3 perhapssignificant that Maoiianus wrote on March 24th&quot;I had that specialist up to see me and he stated that it was a complete nervous oollapse.   Ho insists on my having a holiday at some South Western seaside town and al30 to devote all ray summer week-ends to tho country and to plenty of walking.     Organically I am all right but if I do not take precautions I will become susceptible to anything that may be passim And I feel like taking his advice.   I attended the: meeting of the &apos;ConsulteVtivo&apos; Cojaaittee to-day and arrived back, home exhausted.1&apos;The Chief Constable of Birmingham has sent me a oopyof suggestions made by the Party Sub-Executive regardingthe financial policy;-&quot;The whole matter of the Party organisation and administration had to be gone into and. a special 6UB-B.C. meeting was called for that purpose on Monday evening, March 6th.     After three hours discussion the meeting was adjourned till the fellowing evening, when the sub-E.C having decided that * memhership,;.ef 100,000 was necessary befeire we could claim to he a maes party, agreed to sufcmit the following suggestions to the B.C.&quot;The weekly subacriptlen is tee heavy and ahtuHL he replaced by an initiation fee ef a shilling with a half-yearly subscription ef a shilliJig, all of whioh should be sent to headquarters.   The branches -to U&amp;siiga weekly payments to suit their own requirements.Branches, instead of gaining the respect and trust of the workers In their neighbourhood, generally aiitagonise them.     This may be due to unnecessary .&apos;sneering at religion, a tendency to abuse the workers and treat them as ignorant fools, bragging of our Own emancipation from capitalism and capitalist thought by introducing questions of sex, etc.   This should be avoided and all our attention given to the everyday problems of the workers&apos; industrial and social life.An alteration of rulo to prevent branches from expelling members for. very trivial causes, or striking them off the books immediately they fall behind with dues.Specific/
4 A AiSpecific lead should he given by the E.C. to branches regarding the formation of groups in the different looal bodies, Trades Unions, etc-.Present Divisional Organisation should be abandoned and organisers be placed in districts whore there are largo bodies of workers.Allocations should be mado wherever possible for branch headquarters.   All such headquarters to have Trusteeship vested in national Officials,More money should be spent in sotting up small printing raachinos throughout- the country for leaflet publications, etc.Administration at Party headquarters to be overhauled and put on an entirely new basis.   This applies also to the supplementary depart;to:it.In submitting these suggestions to- tho Executive Coroaittoe the rtub-E.C. can only exoreae the hope that they may form the basis of definite proposals which may be put be fore tho co minis 3 ion to be appointed by the Policy Conference, and that they may bo of some uso in bringing about the re-organisation that is so essential if the Party is going to take its true place in the revolutionary struggle that lies ahead.&quot;Another indication of changed policy was thestatement of Len Jackson that he visited the electoralcommittee in London last week in company with Oallacherand Leckio and wa3 shown a cheque for  500 which itWQ3 stated was intended for tho electioneering campaign:this statement i3 in accord with the &quot;United Front&quot;policy. -    A,E. Cook is sending out a serios of&quot;Propagandists&apos; notes&quot; for use in the electoralcampaign.Branch meetings have, generally s;oeaking, been occupied with reports of the recent policy conference and it is not unlikely&apos; that, these will cause several splits as there are, in effect, three sections at the present moiaent:    the&apos; anti-parliamentarians, the&apos;paid, agitators who are&apos;obliged to follow the dictates of Moscow: or forfeit their mean a of livelihood and the iaernbers who are building up the underground orillegal/
illegal organisation:   the Policy Conference will probably drive from the Party those extremists who take exception to tho proposed alliance with the Labour Party and those who fear that the application of tho Theses of the Third International will bring tho-a within reach of the law. The underground members, who take themselves very seriously, arc plotting industriously and have already installed two wireless jets:   the idea is that when the &quot;revolution&quot; comes and the Government takes control of ordinary means of communication messages shall be sent by I means of wireless apparati dotted about the country.London Communists propose to hold nightly meetings to demand the release of Inkpin but on I&amp;arch 27th only about twenty people assembled outside Pentonville and about 100 on the following day.There is still considerable opposition to Mr. J.H. Thomas, M.P., in Communist ranks and an official stated last week that the proper way to defeat him was      j from within the ranks of the National. Union of Railway menArthur Rea&amp;o, who formerly edited the Bolshevik University organ &quot;The Free Oxford&quot; has informed the acting secretary of the Communist Party that he is &quot;being put into communication with someone who is very likely going to help &quot;The Free Oxford&apos; - this will enable mo to pay the Bcnbow Printing Company.&quot;   This statement is significant in view of the fact&apos;that Reado is now working for &quot;The Labour Monthly&quot;, end is therefore automatically in touch with tho labour Research Departrant, which, as stated in last week&apos;o-report, has recently received money from.Moscow.Arthur L&amp;cManug. has been appointed one of the Third International delegates to the forthcoming Joint Conference of Internationals in Berlin:   efforts are being made to arrange demonstrations in all Europeancapitals,,
capitals in connection with this Conference.-On March 26th fifocManua, Leckie andlacher addressed a &quot;public meeting at tho Baths Hall, Coventry:    the speeches-dealt chiefly with the situation arising from thecandidatures of Lockie and Robert William and the-necessity for a. united front was repeatedly emphasised. About 1,500 people were present.RUSSIAN PROPAGANDA IN THE DKITgD KINGDOMThis week has added to the already existing evidence on the subject of Russian Propaganda in this country:the current   issue of the &quot;International press Corresponder,the Moscow organ edited by Philips Price, containsdefinite instructions regarding &quot;the task of &quot;the communists in the trade unions&quot;:   these are a rechauffe1of the resolutions adopted by the February meeting of theComintern in Moscow and it must be regarded as more thana coinc.ide.noe in view of MacManus1 return some days agofrom this Conference, that, on March 24th, the actingnational organiser of the Communist Party sent to all. branches &apos;a rasmg rand urn on the subject of &quot;Party members and the Red. International&apos;of Labour Unions.&quot;     In this document members are informed that:&quot;The time is rapidly approaching when.the various Trade, unions&apos;: will be requesting branches to forward resolutions&apos; for tho forthcoming Annual Conferences., mid. it is the duty of all Party .- members who are members of a-Trade- Union to take -steps- to have placed on the agendas of such conferences a resolution favouring the-secession of the organisation from the&apos; Amsterdam International -federation of Trade Unions and affiliation to the Red Int emat i0nal o f labour Unions&apos;.&quot;As a rule these conferences are. he id prior to-&apos;&apos;   the Trades Union Oougre-as and. this body.will shortly be preparing its agenda for the Congress in September narc.     Branches of Unions have not the privileges of placing resolutions on this agenda.^: but they can bring pressure to bear upon their respective ,Executives to take similar steps as the above and ao ensure that this year a discussion/
- a -discussion on this all important question will take place at the Trades Union Congress.&quot;We would further draw the attention of branches to the necessity of working in complete harmony with the local R.I.L.U. committees where such are in existence.    If, as may be probable, no such committee exists, then it is the duty of the branch and its members to take the initial steps to erect such a oommittee representative of the Trade Union branches in your area.     Secretaries are requested to get into communication with the British Bureau of the Red International of Labour Unions (3, Wellington Street, Strand, London, W.C.2.) for further information as to the best methods to proceed.&quot;Bolshevik attention to detail is illustrated by the fact that a copy of &quot;International Press Correspondence&quot; has this week been addressed to &quot;Tho Woman Clerk&quot;, the organ I of the Association of Women Clerks and Secretaries.On March 10th a message regarding tho engineers1 dispute!was stnt from Moscow via Petrograd presumably by Losowsky.The following is an extract:&quot;We propose to organise a common international campaign against a lock-out, start obligatory subscriptions among the metal workers of all countries , for the benefit of the British comrades...and organise f boycott of British orders in this branch tf industry, are preparad toand to invite all revolutionary worke to support any proposals suitable for giving effioacio assistance to the British metal workers in the struggleIt would pessibly not be inaccurate to connect Ewer&apos;recent visit to Moscow with the appearance in the &quot;daily herald&quot; in serial form of Trotsky^ &quot;Imperialism andRevolution&quot;:   the first instalment on March 28th was preface!by the following paragraph:&quot;Tho following space has been taken at advert isenuj rates for the publication of extracts from Trotsky&apos;s story of the Georgian Republic.   Other extracts will folio?/, in space similarly taken for the purpose, throughout the week.   The COMPLETE text will appear immediately afterwards in a series of special supplements to the Communist&apos;.&quot;The Communist Party is. certainly not in a position to pay advertisement rates for the publication of this story Hthe &quot;Daily Horald&quot; or for preliminary puffs such as appears in &quot;Royn(*ldrs Nows&quot; on March 27th:   the articles ore desori&apos; as the &apos;Story of the Georgian Menshevik Republic&quot; but are actually very thinly veiled Bolshevik propaganda.THE/
THE YOUNG COMMUNIST LEAGUE.The Executive Committee of the Young Comciunist League has sent into this country oopies of a manifesto dated Moscow, March 8th, 1922, in which &quot;all young workers of hot;:, sexes&quot; are urged to take part in &quot;the international battle against the pauperization of the working youth&quot;:     this manifesto contains in addition to a number of heavy type slogans a list of demands, including:Mini-urn wages, corresponding to the minimum cost of living.Fight against the viclation of the right hour day, against trade education&apos; after working&apos;hours and for the establishment of the sis: hour day for minors.Provision for the young unanployed.Establishment of educational shops for the young unemployed.24 hour Sunday rest.Four weeks1 yearly vacation with full pay.Prohibition of night and Sunday work.Abolition of the work of miners in trades and factories which are injurious to their health,-(Certain branches of the chemical industry, underground work in mines, etc.)IIFor Apprentices,-Limitation of the number.of apprentices.Abolition of individual indentures, apprentices to be included in collective agreements.Control of the employment of apprentices by the trade-unions and the shop councils.The February issue of &quot;Lie Junge Garde&quot; announces thatEnglish editions of TDas Proletarischo Kind&quot; and &quot;Ler JungcGenosse&quot; are due to appear.-The Young Workers League in America is in touch withthe/

The Gorman Allgemeine Arbeiter Verband has workedcut the Constitution in greater detail and lays down thefollowing immediate programme.&quot;The immediate objects of the A.A..U. are:-&quot;Tho revolutionising of the workshops hy propaganda and action,&quot;The promotion of partial strikes, general strikes and workshops struggles of every kind that have a Communist aim,&quot;The methods of the proletarian struggle are: strike, revolt, passive resistance, occupation of the workshops, and systematic sabotage,&quot;Active participation in every revolutionary action, national and international,&quot;Struggle by propaganda and action for . revolutionary workshop &quot;committees.&quot;Closest unity and solidarity of action with the unemployed, through revolutionary oommittees,&quot;Furtherance of the responsibility for action, instead of a policy of giving out watchwords, through developing self-consciousness&quot;.      *TO SOCIALIST LABOUR P.AHTYThomas Mitchell, the secretary of this party, states that it is in a &quot;very desperate position for finance&quot; and that &quot;there is very grave danger of us having to. shut down.,.any week now&quot;, HE UNION OF POST OFFICE VTOHKSRSThe accounts of this union for the year ending December 31-st, 19SI, throw interesting light upon the activities of the officials who control this section of Government workers.The strike fund brought in  66,385..13.11 and this amount plus interest is on &quot;deposit at the Co-operative Wholesale Society and Barclay^-banks:    1,012.13.10 is invested in &quot;Daily Herald&quot; dobyntures, but this paper1s &quot;Stamp Fund&quot; only yielded  5.10.     The Annual Conference cost the union  4,413.16.11; the affiliation fees to the Trade Uiui k Congress amounted to  416.6,8 but the political fund disclose., an outlet for much of the union&apos;u money, the following items being worthy of note: Affiliation/

IRISH REVOLUTIONARY ACTIVITIES IN THE UNITED KINGDOM.,As time goes on it is becoming more evident that the Conference in London of the Irish Self-Determination league on the 1st April will be a lively one.   All over the countr? prominent men in the movement are ranging themselves either for or against the Treaty.   Art 0&apos;Brien is coming in for some hard knoeks in the press where one writer warns him that Irishmen in England&quot; have no intention of lending countenance, patronage or pecuniary support to enable anyone oarrylng on a faotionist campaign in this country in opposition to the Free State,0TBrien is advised to return to the Gaelic league if he wishes to retain the affection and sympathy of Irishman,Altogether 13 motions from branches all over England and Wales will coma before the Convention.   One of the London motions declares that the organisation shall giv* its official and undivided support to the ffwrernment of Ireland sleeted at the General Election whether Shree State or Republic.    Twe other london motions are against the Treaty.P.J. Kelly and Art O^Brien are both nominated fdr the Presidency of the league.    Mr. Kelly is in favour&apos; of the Treaty and 0&apos;Brien against it and there is sure to be a very bitter fight.So far as the Republican  minority is concerned there is Btlll considerable activity and the persistent quest for arms in this country indicates trouble of a serious nature in Ireland at no very distant date.   The North of England and Scotland appear to be the real hunting grounds of the Republican agents.   Week after week reports reach us of arms agents visiting these centres.   The latest is HarryBoland/
