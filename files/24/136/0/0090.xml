5 3 BnFIKSNTIAL.P. 3989.C A B I if 5 ? aoiaHTTEE   OP HOME.   AFFAIRS.2JCQJOM (MISC31LTASESQUS PROVISIOHS) BILL .Memorandum by the president, Board of Bancation.(Clauses I * 3 Equation.)Clause 1. Clause 1 serves three purposes -(a) it brings the Education Act 1921 into operation with certain exceptions;(^p) it provides expressly for the suspension of a certainprovision of the Education Act 1918;. and (c) it legalises under certain conditions the discontinuance of Continuation Schools in those areas in which suchschools are at present in existence,With regard to (a), the proposal is probably uncontentious. The Education Act 1921. was an Act to consolidate the law of education and the effect of it is that it is almost impossible to amend that law until the Act cf 1921 has been brought fully into operation.    The Proposal is consequently a necessary preliminary to Clauses 1 to 5 of tho Bill.With regard to (b), Section 8(2) of the Education Act 1918, which is not yet in operation.provides that byelaws may be made, with the approval of the Board of Education, requiring children to stop in Public Elementary Schools up to the ago of 15 instead of up to 14j Which is the normal leaving age.    Ho such byelaws are contemplated at present and if .any proposals&apos; for that purpose were made the Board of Education would veto them.    This pro-vision was embodied in the Education Act 1921 and the present Bill provides that that particular provision shall not. come intooperation, and shall only come into operation if the Board make a. further Order. There is no particular advantage attaching to this part of the clause and no doubt when the Bill, comes before Parliament an amendment will be proposed to omit it.
W 1th regard to- -(c),,-&quot;&quot;lru- ^n^Ti,....Birmlngham. and&apos; other- -are-as Appointed Days have been fixed on whioh the compulsoryprovisions of the Education Act 1918 with regard to Continuation Schools came into, force.     Some of these areas feel a difficulty in enforcing compulsory attendance at Continuation Schools having regard to the fact that these compulsory provisions do not extend ahd are hot likely to extend for some time to other areas.   \ The proposal therefore is in substance to annul the Appointed &quot;bays which have been made.     The proposal is likely to be contentious but the case for it is really unanswerable.      In existing circum-stances it is impossible to compel a few local Education Authorities to enforce attendance at compulsory Continuation Schools while no compulsion exists in any other part of the country.Clause 2 provides that a parent shall not be required to send his child to school till the age of 6 unless he desires to do so.      It will be remembered that the Committee on National Expenditure proposed to shut the schools to all children below the age of 6.     That proposal was not adopted and the present clause represents what is left of it. Sub-Clause (a) expressly affirms tho right of a parent t of a child between 5 and 6 to send the child to school if he so wishes.Clause   5^This Claxise is mainly designed to surmount certain difficulties which arose out of the decision in the case of Hansonv. The Radcllffe Urban District Council.     That Clause made it doubtful whether a Local Education Authority could require the salaries of teachers in Voluntary Schools to be reduced.     It is clearly unjust that Local Education Authorities should be able to reduce salaries in Provided Schools and not in Voluntary Schools, and the object of the clause is to put the two classes of schools on an equality in that respect. !NA&apos;
Clause 4.Section 118 of the Education Act, 1921j provided for the payment in certain cases of a grant known as the Deficiency Grant equal to 50$ of the expenditure of Local Education Authorities.     There was a certain power to disallow expenditure for the purposes of this grant, hut it:is-questionable whether under prevailing conditions the power is sufficient.     Clause 4 confers Upon the Board of Education a power to limit their grants in such a way that the total, amount of the Board1s estimates for education cannot be-exceeded.Clause 5.At&quot; the present time there are many Secondary Schools in the country which though nominally voluntary institutions conducted by Governing Bodies acting under charitable trusts are in fact almost entirely maintained by Local Education Authorities.     This situation gives rise to many legal difficulties and financial anomalies, and the clause provides that the Governing Body of a Secondary School or other place of higher education may &quot;transfer it with it3 endowments to the Local Education Authority.     The clause is exactly parallel to similar clauses which already apply to Elementary Schools.(Intd,)     H.P.Board of Education, Hay 2Srd, 1922,
