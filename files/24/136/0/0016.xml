[This Document Is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.]Printed for the Cabinet.   March 1922.C.P.-3916DECISION OF THE REP AR AT [ON COMMISSION ON THE SUBJECT OF THE PAYMENTS TO BK MADE BY GERMANY IN .1022.(!-)Brit-Mi Delegation, (B.D. No. 215/22.) Reparation Commission,(Report No. 271.) &quot; Astoria,&quot; Paris, March 24, 1922.May it please your Lordships,I iiavk the honour to invite your attention to the decision of the Reparation Commission of the 2.1st instant and the letter addressed to the German Government on the same date, copies of whioh 1 have already transmitted to you, on the subject of the payments to he made by Germany in 1922 and tho conditions subject to which a provisional postponement of a part of the liability under the Schedule of Payments has been granted.Your Lordships will observe that the amounts prescribed both for cash payments and deliveries in kind are those which were the outcome of the deliberations of the Allied Governments at the Cannes Conference.Although by the recent decision of these Governments the (piestion whether, and, if so, to what extent and subject to what conditions a postponement should be allowed was referred buck to the Commission to be determined by it in virtue of its Treaty Powers, the effective discretion enjoyed by the Commission, was, in fact, apparent rather than real.The figures in question had not merely already been substantially agreed by the Allied Governments themselves as representing the minimum which they would be prepared to accept, but they had formed the subject of direct, if informal, negotiations between the representatives of some, at any rate, of the Allied Governments and those of the German Government.The letter of the German Government of the 28th January in reply to the Commission&apos;s demand for a programme of payments for 1922, though not accepting these figures, clearly contemplated the probability that they would be imposed by decision either of the Allied Governments or of the Commission, and offered no conclusive evidence that they represented a measure of performance of which Germany would be incapable.In these circumstances it would have been difficult for the Corn-mission, having regard to the terms of Article 234 of the Treaty of Versailles, to decide that a more extensive postponement was [8137] B
necessary, and almost impossible for us to refuse what had virtually already been offered by the creditor Powers.The figures should not, however, be taken as representing the considered judgment of the Commission as to the economic capacity of Germany to make reparation in the year in question. Such a judgment, in the face of the present disorganisation of the German finances and exchanges, would be an impossible task, nor had the Commission under the Treaty the duty of attempting to discharge it.The Treaty liability of Germany for 1922 is determined by the Schedule of Payments. The Commission was merely called upon to consider the degree of postponement necessitated by the facts dis-olosed in the application of the German Government. The decision must, in my view, be regarded as representing the minimum post-ponement consistent with the avoidance of an immediate breakdown, granted experimentally and without clear assurance that it will constitute a final settlement even for the period for which it aims at providing.While, however, as T have indicated, there was no real question for the Commission to decide as to the figures, the conditions of the postponement constituted a more difficult problem.The deliberations of the Cannes Conference were of great assistance to us as indicating broadly the views held by the Allied Governments, and it will be seen that our decisions follow very closely the general outlines sketched by the Cannes memorandum. It was, as that memorandum indicated, a matter of common agreement that any concessions made to Germany should be conditional upon early and drastic steps b&quot;ing taken to remedy the budgeting and other financial abuses which if unchecked must rapidly undermine the whole economic fabric of the country, not only destroying the hope of exacting reparations in future but even endangering the social structure itself.Although such reforms are obviously essential in the interests of Germany herself, there is a general consensus of opinion that German initiative alone cannot be relied upon in existing circumstances to bring them about. The memorandum clearly contemplated the imposition on Germany of a measure of supervision or even actual control by representatives of the Allied Powers.On the other hand, it gave no very precise guidance as to the manner in which such control should be enforced, the intention being to invite proposals from the German Government before formulating a definite plan.Such proposals were, in fact, asked for in the Commission^ letter to the German Government of the 13th January, but the response, as contained in the reply of the 26th idem, cannot be held to represent any substantial progress.The Commission had therefore itself to formulate a plan.Two distinct lines of.procedure might be envisaged.Under the one the responsibility of the German Government for the initiation of fiscal legislation, the regulation of Government expenditure and general administration would be left unimpaired, the Reparation Commission, as the agent of the Allied Powers, con-cerning itself primarily with the results to be achieved and the limits of time within which they must be obtained.Under the other the German (&quot;government would be required to accept the directions of the Commission as to the taxes to be imposed, submit its estimates on expenditure for the approval of the Commis-
sion, both in gross and in detail, and carry on its administration antler the supervision of controllers appointed by the Commission and invested with executive authority.Under the former procedure the performance of the German Government would be judged entirely by the results achieved. The penalty for failure would be the withdrawal of the concessions granted, with the result that Germany would inevitably be placed in default in respect of her Treaty obligations and exposed to the coercive measures which the Allied Powers are entitled to adopt .in that contingency which, however disastrous in their results they may be to all parties concerned, arc the only ultimate sanction for intractability.Under the latter procedure, a large part, at any rate, of the responsibility for results would, where the directions of the Commis-sion had been acted upon, devolve upon the Commission. If the directions of the Commission were ignored, recourse would have to be had to the same sanctions as those contemplated under the former procedure.As to the choice between these alternatives, the Cannes memo-randum, for the reasons I have indicated, gave no precise guidance. The arguments which can be advanced in favour and against each are familiar to your Lordships, and I do not propose to repeat them.The Commission has, as will be seen from its decision, elected for the time being, at any rate, lor the first.The German Government, however, should cherish no delusions that if reasonably satisfactory results are not forthcoming without delay, we shall have any alternative but to refer the problem (which will then necessitate steps beyond our competence) to the Allied Governments or that it will then be possible for the Allied Govern-ments to refrain from action which, apart from other grave conse-quences, cannot leave intact the fiscal autonomy of the German people.Of the conditions imposed by the Commission, the one with which compliance will be most difficult is undoubtedly that for an immediate and drastic increase of German taxation. I am fully conscious of the considerations of internal politics involved, as well as of the real economic and social embarrassment which will necessarily be created.The continuance, however, of the vicious practice of meeting a high percentage of the total Government expenditure by the creation of fictitious money during a period for which the llepiiration burden is temporarily reduced for the very purpose of enabling a commence-ment to be made of serious financial reform would be a reduotio ad absurdum of the moratorium policy.Even if the additional taxation asked for by the Commission is imposed and all possible economies are made in the estimates of expenditure, the dimensions of the remaining deficit are likely materially to exceed the amount which a country with Germany&apos;s present internal and external credit can reasonably hope to raise by genuine loans, and there is no certitude that the general financial situation at the end of the moratorium period will not be worse than it is at present.While I recognise the enforcement of such taxation as is proposed requires a high degree of courage on the part of the German Govern-raent and heavy sacrifices by the German people, I cannot resist the conclusion that either it must be forced or the Allied Governments must be prepared to receive substantially smaller reparation pay-

(3.)Annex 1353.The Reparation Commission to the Chancellor oj the Reich. (Translated from the original text in French.)March 21, 1922.This Reparation Commission, in notifying to the German Govern -ment their Decision No. 1841 in respect of the payments to be made by Germany during 1922, makes the following observations in regard to the Chancellors letter of the 28th January, 1922.The Commission notes the declarations made by the Chancellor in regard to the suppression of all subsidies on food, and to the increase of the postal and railway tariffs with a view to balancing the expenditure and receipts of State undertakings, At the same time, even if it could be supposed, as would not appear to be the case, that plans had been laid for the immediate and complete realisation of such a programme, it is far from being adequate either to the German obligation or to the German capacity. The Reparation Commission most clearly warns the German Government that it expects a much more radical reform of the finances of Germany and a final abandon-irmnt of the mistaken policy hitherto followed.The Ordinary Administrative Budget of the Reich shows a balance of 16A- milliard paper marks after providing for an expenditure of 83 milliards. The German Government propose to apply this balance towards meeting the cost of Reparation and other Peace Treaty charges. But, on the other hand, the Extraordinary Administrative Budget shows a deficit of some 3 milliard marks, and the Budget for the Administration of Public Services a deficit of 9J milliards.The Budget for Peace Treaty charges as submitted (after taking credit  for 1P4  milliards surplus  transferred from  the Ordinaryactually paid in 1921 and 1922 shall, together with interest at 5 per cent, per annum, remain ah obligation upon Germany to be discharged in addition to the annuities under the Schedule of Payments as soon as the Reparation Commission shall consider this within her capacity.IV.The postponement hereby granted is in the first instance provisional only.The Commission will, on the 31st May next, examine the progress made by the .German Government towards satisfying the conditions laid down in the Reparation Commission^ letter of even date and will thereupon confirm or cancel this provisional postponement.Jf it is cancelled, the amounts provisionally postponed under the decision of the 13th January, 1922, and under this decision, will become due and shall be paid within fourteen days of the date of cancellation, failing which paragraph 17, Annex II to Part VIII of the Treaty shall come into force.If, however, this provisional postponement is confirmed, and if the Reparation Commission is subsequently satisfied that Germany lias failed to carry out the conditions laid down, the postponement will be cancelled, and the Schedule of Payments, as communicated to Germany on the 5th May, 1921, will again come into operation as from the date of cancellation.
Administrative Budget), exhibits a deficit of no less than 171 milliard paper marks, making, with the deficit on the Extraordinary Administrative Budget and Budget for Administration of Public Services, a total deficit of 1S3J, milliards.The deficit of 171 milliards on the Peace Treaty Budget is, it is true, based, as regards the Separation Liability, on the Schedule of Payments. The provisional postponement to-day accorded by the Reparation Commission in respect of the 1922 payments may be expected to reduce this deficit by approximately 45 milliards. On the other hand, the Budget calculations are based on an exchange of 45 paper marks to 1 gold mark as against the current rate of 70. The net estimated deficit of 120 milliards will, therefore, be largely exceeded unless a substantial improvement in the value of the paper marks can be effected.It is stated, indeed, that an Internal Compulsory Loan is con-ternplated, but no project has been placed before the Commission which can be regarded by them as in any way likely to afford the requisite guarantee that the Treaty charges will be met.The Commission is of opinion that the Treaty charges must he progressively and rapidly incorporated in the Budget, in so far as Germany&apos;s revenues can cover them, and that German capital must make up the balance either by means of a loan or a direct levy.The Commission considers that as from 1922 onward the Budget must cover a large part of the reduced payments prescribed by the decision referred to above; the balance as indicated above must be contributed by capital.Tt is with the object of facilitating the task of the German Government in this respect that the Commission has taken its decision. It must, however, be understood that the Scheme of Payments for 1922 therein laid down is provisional, and that the postponement provisionally granted can only be definitely maintained if Germany strictly observes the conditions imposed ui)on her.These conditions are as follows:-I. Budget of the Rkjcii. (A.) Resources.Measures to be Adopted.(a.) Each of the measures announced by the German Govern-menfs Note of the 28th January, 1922, which, according to the Note, are to come into force at fixed dates, shall be taken at the date in question; if this date has passed without the measure having been taken, it shall be taken within fifteen days of th.e present notification.-(b.) The new taxes and charges contained in the programme of the 26th January, 1922, generally known in Germany as the &quot;fiscal compromise,&quot; shall be voted and applied before the 30th April, 1922.(c.) The German Government must at once prepare and put into force such a scheme of increased taxation as will provide during the currency of the Budgetary year 1922-23 a sum of at least 60 milliards paper marks in addition to the revenue contemplated in the Budget.This scheme must have been voted and be in force before the 31st May, 1922, and must secure the actual collection of not less
than 40 milliards of additional revenue before the 31st December, 1922.((/.) In the opinion of the Commission, it is for the German Government to choose the sources from which the new revenue is to come. Nevertheless, the Commission impresses upon the German Government the necessity of adopting a scheme which will avoid as far as possible a new and complicated assessment of the resources of individuals. In this connection, the Reparation Commission particularly invites the German Government to consider the possibility of some arrangement under which the rates of taxation would be automatically increased in proportion cither to any further increases in the debt of the German Government to the Reichsbank or to the diminution of the internal purchasing power of the mark.Control.(a.) All legislative or administrative measures adopted in oxecu-tion of the above provisions shall be immediately communicated by the Gorman Government to the Reparation Commission.(/).) The measures for the application of German legislation determining taxes and tariffs as it may be established after carrying out the programme set forth above shall be discussed between the delegates of the German Government and those of the Reparation Commission. The latter shall, through the Committee of Guarantees, exercise at each stage a control sufficiently thorough to enable it at all time to satisfy itself as to the application of this legislation, and more especially as to the work of assessing and collecting the taxes, and to detect any defects therein. It occasion arises, it will request Germany to take the measures necessary to remedy the defects detected and will take action in case Germany does not, within a. reasonable time.1, adopt measures which the Commission considers to be sufficient.(B.) Reduction oj Expenditure.Measures to be Adopted. &quot;*The German Government shall carry out and submit to the Reparation Commission within one month of the present notification a revision of the expenditure entered in the Draft Budget for 1922, which it submitted as an Appendix to its Note of the 28th January, .1922.A serious effort, for which only preliminary preparations are made in the scheme enclosed with the communication of the 28th January, may and must be made towards the reduction of expenditure on the public services, the suppression of subventions and subsidies and of expenditure on public works not urgently required, of sumptuary expenses, of the share in the expenses of various administrative and other organisations, itc.The expenditure shall in no case exceed, either for the total budget or for any chapter thereof, the sums entered in the budget of expenditure thus revised, save in exceptional cases and after corrc-sponding credits have been duly voted ; in such cases the Reparation Commission shall receive immediate notification.The German Government shall undertake not to transfer to local budgets any service or category of expenditure at present included
in the budget of the Reich, under the terms of the draft budget of 1922, enclosed with the Note of the 28th January, 1922.Control.The German Government shall draw up, in agreement with the Reparation Commission, a scheme for the control of the expenditure provided for in the budget, in such a way as to prevent the credits from being exceeded and so as to show clearly the actual use to which the funds are put. The Committee of Guarantees will check the functioning of this control.II. Loans and Lkvy on Capital. (a.) Internal Loans.The German Government shall, before the 30th April, 1922, prepare a scheme for the issue of internal loans other than Treasury Hills discounted by the Reiehsbank and for an amount sufficient to cover the budget deficit until the budget can be balanced by means of the receipts from taxes.(h.) Foreign Loans.The important question of loans to he contracted by Germany in order to enable her to redeem a portion of her capital reparation debt will form the subject of a separate communication.If a portion of Germany&apos;s debt cannot be mobilised by such loans within a reasonable period, the German Government shall, in co-operation with the Reparation Commission, examine the measures necessary to effect a capital payment by other means, in particular, by a levy on the actual movable and immovable property of Germany.III. Migration ok Capital.The German Government shall submit to the Reparation Commis-sion, before the 30th April, 1922, a scheme for preventing the abuses in the exportation of capital.The special object of this scheme must bo to render more effective the functioning of the organisation created by the German Govern-ment for the collection of the foreign currencies obtained by exports and services of every kind, and in general to make sure that the value of exports is returned to Germany.The Committee of Guarantees will draw up with the German Government a scheme: for the strengthening and development of the control which it at present exercises over exports and the collection of currencies to such extent as may be necessary to ensure the effective supervision of the execution of the measures referred to above.Finally, the German Government shall take all possible steps to obtain the return to Germany of the capital already exported.In view of the importance which the Reparation Commission attaches to the question of preventing the future migration of capital and of ensuring the return to Germany of the capital already exported, this question will be the subject of further examination separately by the Reparation Commission. The application by the German Government of the supplementary measures which the Reparation Commission may think it necessary to require is one of the conditions of the postponement.
IV. Autonomy of the Reichshank.The German Government shall adopt, in time for it to come into force before the 81st May, 1022, the legislation necessary to ensure, to the satisfaction of the Reparation Commission, the complete indc-pendence of the Rcichsbank from the German Government.V. Statistics.The German Government will, before the Mist May, 1922, resume the preparation and publication of its economic and financial statistics, in the same form and at the same intervals as before the war. It will also prepare at such intervals as may be determined by the Reparation Commission in each case, any new statistics or any new presentation of statistics in existence before the war as the Commission may consider to be useful with a view to the execution of the Treaty and in particular of the present provisions.The German Government shall, in collaboration with the Com-mittee of Guarantees, see that the statistics are presented under conditions which will facilitate the work of the Reparation Commis-sion.The&apos;German Government shall place at the disposal of the Com-mitte all documents and information necessary for the accomplish-ment of its task-, and shall give it every facility for carrying out the investigations required of it.VI. Questions in Abeyance.The granting of the postponement is also subject to the settle-incnt, to the satisfaction of the Reparation Commission, of certain questions now pending, which will form the subject of a further communication.(Signed)      DUBOIS.DELACROIX. BRADBURY. i)&apos;AMELIO.
