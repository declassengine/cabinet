THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.CABINET.TRADE   BOARDS    BILL.MEMORANDUM BY THE MINISTER OF LABOUR FOR THE HOME AFFAIRSCOMMITTEE.ISBCRET. I circulated to the Cabinet on the 4th May, a memorandumO.Pv i     dealing with the Report of the Committee appointed under the 15990^       Chairmanship of Lord Cave to enquire into the Trade Boardsystem.     I attach a copy of that Memorandum which contains as an appendix the recommendations of the Committee.     After discussing the note the Cabinet authorised me to proparo a Bill for consideration by tho Home Affairs Committee on the lines suggested in my memorandum, that la to say, broadly giving effect to the Report of the Committee.     I have now prepared the Bill (which will require some drafting alterations)----     which is attached and submitted for consideration by mycolleagues.In order to indicate clearly how far the Report is-----     carried out in detail I attach a note   taking- the recommanda-tions one by one and shewing ^?hare and how they have been Incorporated in the Bill.     In addition I have indicated what recommendations are modified and in Appendix III. what points not covered by tho Cave Committee at all are dealt with in the Bill.It will be seen that the points in which the Cave Report are modified aro of a vory minor character and that the additional points dealt with are of a purely administrative type and raise no general questions whatever.It will, be convenient to draw special attention to the principal alterations in the present system proposed by the
Cave Committee&apos; (all of which are accepted) in order that the general lines of the Bill maybe readily intelligible.The Committee accepted the principle of Trade Boards and were unanimously of opinion that the system should be continued,     The three principal defects to which they drew attention were as indicated in my memorandum to the Cabinet(a) general want of elasticity and adaptability in the working of the Boards;(b) a tendency on the part of the Boards to become goneral wage regulating authorities, and(c) the failure of the Boards, owing to the absence of local machinery, to adapt rates to suit special local conditions.In order to meet the first point the Committee made the following proposals t-(i) That the period for lodging objections to proposed variations of rates should be reduced from two months to a month and that the period of considering the ratos before confirmation by the Minister should be reduced from a month to a fortnight.     In addition the Committee suggested an administrative change by which the necessary notice should date from, the publication of the rates in. the &quot;London Gazette&quot; and not from the date when they were delivered to the individual employer, often inevitably a fortnight or three weeks after the rates had actually been proposed.These recommendations are aocopted in the Bill (Schedules 4 and 5) and would have tho effect of reducing the period required to vary a rate from a time approaching three months to a period of about six weeks.
(ii) It wae proposed further that the Boards should have tho power at the stage when the proposed rates come before them to be fixed to make alterations in them upon the objections received without going through the process of giving notice again, which is the present procedure. This change, whioh is adopted,  (Schodule 4 (3)) will again materially assist in the speeding up of tho whole machine, (iii) At present no rate can be altered within six months from the time when it was originally confirmed without the express consent of the. Minister.     It is proposed by the Committee that this restriction should be removed and this proposal is accepted, (iv) It is proposed that Trade Boards should have the power.to fix a complete series of rates either on sliding scales or on such other convenient basis as they may decide to be appropriate, thus avoiding as each new rate comes into operation, the necessity for further notice being givon.     This recommendation is acoepted.      (Clause 15 (3)). (v) One of the difficulties urged by employers was that in the case of time-rates the slow worker who could not earn the normal rate became so expensive that the employer had either to make a loss or to dismiss him.     In order to meet this point the Committee proposed
that power to exempt these workers on the ground that they are &quot;slow&quot; should, he given to the Trade Boards.     This recommendation is adopted (Clause 21.)(vi) Complaint has been made that in certain casesmore than one rate applies to.the same establish-ment.     The Committee recommend that in such oases the Minister should have power to decide which of the various rates should apply to that establishment.     This recommendation is accepted (Clause to be drafted).     In this connection also, in order to deal with an allied point the Committee recommend that the Minister should have power to set up a Board for two or more trades the object being to reduce, if possible, the number of Boards.       This recommendation is accepted.      (Clause 3 (3)). (vii) The Cave Committee propose that where a case is established to the satisfaction of the Minister after public enquiry for the withdrawal of a Trade from the Acts., the Minister may either withdraw it absolutely or suspend.     Tho power to suspend is new and is accepted.      (Clause 1 (3)).
On tho second point - the tendency of the Boards to become wage regulating authorities - tho Committee make the following recommendations;-(a) in the first place they are of opinion that the present practice by which, when a new Board is set up* a public enquiry as. to its necessity is held at the Minister&apos;e discretion, should &quot;be revised, and that such an enquiry should bo held in every case.    To this extent, therefore * tho Committee recommend full public examination of the whole of the facts of the case before new Boards are set^ up.    This recommendation ia accepted.   (Clause 1 (1)).(b) Under the present Acts a Trado Board can he set up where &quot;no adequate machinery exists for the offective regulation of wages throughout the trado and that, accordingly, having regard to the rates of wages prevailing in the trade or any part of the trade,  it is expedient that the principal Act should apply to that trade.&quot;     In order to make it still clearer both that wages must be unduly low and that organisation must be ineffective, tho Cave Committee recommend that theso two conditions should he set out separately and equally emphasized.    This recommendation is accepted,  (clause 1  (I)).(c) The third recommendation on this head, perhaps the most important made by tho Committee, is a point to which I particularly desire to draw the attention of the Home Affairs Committee.      It arises on Clauses 9 to 15 and 26  (5) Schedule 5 of the Bill relating to Grade rates. Under the Acts of 1909 and 1918 the Trade Boards have powers to fix rates which are criminally enforceable, to cover the whole trade.    So long as trade was good no objection was raised, but as the numbor of Boards increased and following upon the depression of trade which culminated in November 1920, objections began*\
to be raised or. the ground that the Trade Boards were no -longer fixing anti-sweating rates but wero becoming in fact wage-regulating authorities fixing a series of rates.     The volume of criticism lei me to the conclusion, that it was necessary to re-examine the powors of Trade Boards generally and accordingly I appointed the &apos;Committee under the Chairmanship of Lord Cave in September? 1921.      This point was the fundamental one considered by that Committee.      The conclusion which they ren.Ghed unanimously and which is embodied in this Bill, was that the Board should retain the powers given by the 1909 and 1918 Acts with regard to fixing rates for the lowest class of men, women and for juveniles in each trade, but that the powers piyon -by the 1909 and 1918 Acts should not be retained in full as regards the remainder of the workers in those trades.    In tho case of adults two severe restrictions of tho previous powers&apos; of the Boards were proposed(a) that rates for olasses above the lowest could only be fixed as tho result of agreement by a 75 per cent, majority of each of the two sides of the Board, j(b) that rates thus fixed by agreement could be rendered&apos; statutory by confirmation by the Minister of Labour but- would not be enforceable by criminal proceedings.      They would bo enforceable generally by the individual worker as an implied, term of his contract but could be enforced where the worker refused or neglected to take proceedings, by civil proceedings at the Minister^ instance.      The Bill gives effectto this recommendation.
In considering whether this -recommendation should &quot;be adopted, I have taken into account the fact that it is clearly a compromise between the two sides of the Committee.        The Labour Members of the Committee would clearly have preferred, the retention of the existing powers of Trade Boards and one or two of the employers&apos; representatives might have preferred a still further reduction of the powers than that contained in the compromise.      I have, however, reason to suppose that this compromise was the corner-stone upon which unanimity was founded.        If, therefore, the Home Affairs Committee decide to adopt tho recommendation, they have the following grounds upon which it oar. be defended in Parliament:-(a) it rests upon the unanimous report of a strong Committee;(b) even as it stands the recommendation -(a) gives the employers&apos; side of the Boards a vote upon grade rates and(b) abolishes the power to take criminal proceedings in respect of these rates.(c) to refuse the State-enforcement of the grade rates would be tc give the Trade; Boards definitely less powers to deal with, anti-sweating than were conferred upon them by the 1909 Act.On the other hand I feel bound to put to the Home Affairs Committee the considerable difficulties which the proposal to continue the State-enforcement
)of grade rates may&apos; encounter both in tho House and from other points of views-(a) there may well be a feeling that the Gave Committee have not gone far enough in the restriction of powers of Trade Boards, and those who object to all Government interference may press strongly for limiting the powers rigidly so far as State enforcement is concerned tothe wage fixed for the lowest class;(b) if the power of civil recovery by the Minister in respect of agreed grade rates is retained, it is probable that claims for enforcement of agreements reached &quot;by voluntary bodies, such as the Joint Industrial Councils would be pressed even more strongly than heretofore;(c) the broad argument may be advanced that the interference of the Stato should be limited to enforcing what is palpably an anti-sweating rateIf the Home Affairs Committee feel that these argument outweigh those previously advanced, the proposal would be to leave the Trade Boards with the power to agree upon rates above the minima and to leave the individual worker (or the Trade Union on his behalf) to sue for recovery if the rates had been registered with or confirmed by the Minister of Labour and thus become compulsory.Finally, in order to meet the defect caused by lack of attention to local conditions, the Committee make the following recommendations
A. .    In respect of the distributive trades and other trades In which competition does not exist between one part of the country and another, the Committee recommend that autonomous District. Boards shall be set-up with a Co-ordinating Committee in place of the National Boards which were either set-up or in contemplation under the old Acts.     This recommendation is adopted (Clause 3 (3) and 4).     It should, however, be noted that the proposal is not free from difficulties -(a) To set up District Boards will be regarded by tho Labour Party as a direct challenge to the principle of National settlement and will presumably be strenuously resisted in the House of Commons..(b) From another point of view the proposal to set up a number of Boards,, though much smaller in the number of representa-tives sitting upon them, will be attacked on the scoreof needless multiplication of machinery.(c) It is -inevitable that this method of dealing with the matter, though much more satisfactory from the point of view of fixing wages, will involve more expenditure upon machinery, and from this point of view will obviously be attacked in another quarter.B..     Tho Committee proposes further that in the trades where there is competition between area and area the Minister shall have power himself to sot up District Committees of the Central Board which would alter the present practice under which District Committees can only be set up on the initiative of the Central Board.This recommendation is accepted (Clause 4) but the Bill goes rather further than the Cave Report in the sense that it defines the relations between the Central Board and the Committee by giving the Minister power to decide exactly what functions of the Central Board should in each case be delegated to the Local Committee.
The reason for treating the matter in this way is that the few District Committees set up under the existing Acts have been rendered nugatory because they have net had adequate powers . It is not possible to state in the Bill in respect of each trade and every Committee of each trade what powers they should possess, but it is ri60.essary to be able to settle the appropriate powers as and when&apos;occasion arises,A minor point, to which attention may be drawn, is the position of the appointed members.     Under the constitution of Trade Boards, in addition to the equal numbers of represents-five members on both sides, the Board consists of a Chairman assisted by two appointed members, one of whom, must be a woman. A certain amount of criticism against the appointed members has arisen but the Cave Committee&apos; recommended that the system should remain unchanged^- &apos;   I am not entirely in agreement with the Cave Committee in this matter,      I do not, however, propose in the Bill to run counter to the Committees recommendation except that it. will be provided that the   number of appointed members may be either one, two or three, according as may seem desirable,There remain^ the question of expense,   . nzhe Bill, as drafted, if passed, would not,  it is expected,  increase the expenditure upon Trade Boards during the currant financial...year, the expenditure for the previous year being in the neighbourhood of  120,000,     The above statement is made on the assumption that few,  if any, new Boards   would be set up during the year *    On the other hand,  if the number of Boards is increased during the year and still moro, if a number of District Boards and Committees are set up, the expenditure would be to that extent increased, but in any case an. increase of expenditure would have followed inevitably under the old Acts upon an increase in the number of Boards,
In the circumstances,  as over a period of years, it is reasonable to expect that there will Toe an increase in expenditure. I have considered whether any means could be discovered by which the members of the trades (employers and-employed) to whom the Acts were applied could be called upon to pay thsir o^n expenses,     I have come to the conclusion-.(a)    that it is extremely difficult to ask the trades to bear&quot; this expenditure.     The employers might reasonably take, the view that it is unfair that they should have to pay in order to have minimum wages imposed upon them and the Trade Unions might argue that it is equally unfair that ^ they should pay for the protection of their membersagainst sweating, lb)    Apart from this general question I think an attempt to call upon the trades to bear part of the expenditure would be treated as proof that the Government were opposed to the principles embodies in the Trade Eoards Acts and(c)    Even if these difficulties did rot exist it- would be extremely difficult to discover any system of collecting &apos; contributions which would be both practicable and equitable in view of the very largo proportion of persons in the Trade Beard trades amounting in respect of men to 70 per cent, and in respect of women to more than. 80 per cent who are unorganised.     While, therefore, I cannot make any proposal as to a general basis by which contributions could be collected, I should propose to take all the steps that are possible to reduce expenditure to the lowest, possible point.(Sgd)    To J0 MA.C2TAMARA.Ministry of labour, 23rd May, 19SE.

Trade Boards and District Trade Committees. A.D. 1922.3. :(1) The Minister may, subject tp. the provisions Establish-of this Act, establish Trade Boards, to be&apos; constituted in merit of accordance with the provisions of the Second Schedule to this Act and of the regulations made thereunder, for      1 *&apos; any trades to which this Act applies, or for any section of such trades.(2) A Trade-Board shall be established by,regulations made by the Minister of Labour and the regulations shall determine the extent of the: jurisdiction of the Trade Board.(3) The jurisdiction given to a Trade Board may be either throughout the whole of a single trade or section of a trade or throughout two or more trades or sections of a trade or of two or more trades, and in any such case the jurisdiction given to a Trade Board may extend either to a specified district or to the whole of Great Britain or to any part thereof. -(4) Where a Trade Board is given jurisdiction for two or more trades or sections, the Minister may transfer to the; jurisdiction of- that Trade Board&apos; any matters previously within the jurisdiction of another Trade Board.(5) Where, jurisdiction is given to a Trade Board for two or more trades or sections or for two or more districts the Trade Board may exercise any of its powers and duties differently as respects any separate trade, section or district within its jurisdiction.?.:v 4.

A.d. 1922. Fixing of General Minimum Rates.5. (1) Every Trade Board shall, subject to the provisions of this Act, fix the following general minimum rates of wages for time-work (in this Act referred to as &quot; general minimum time-rates &quot;):  5(a) A general minimum time-rate for men, to be fixed with reference to the lowest grade of fully experienced men workers of ordinary skill other than men engaged in ancillary work ;(fi) A general minimum time-rate for women, to he 115fixed with reference to the lowest grade of fully -    experienced women workers of ordinary skill other than women engaged in ancillary work;(c) General minimum time - rates for juvenile workers: 15Provided that (i) If the Trade Board is of opinion that the general minimum time-rate for men or for women, as the case may be, is higher than the rate which should properly apply as respects any class of 20 ancillary workers, the Board may, with the consent of the Minister, fix a lower minimum time-rate for any class of ancillary workers ;(ii) The Trade Board may fix a minimum time-rate for any class of learners or for any class of 25 workers not fully experienced in substitution for the time-rate which would otherwise be applicable;(iii) Where under a contract between a worker and his employer any necessary expenditure 30 in connection with the work is to be defrayed by the worker, or board, lodging, or other consideration in kind is to be provided by the employer, or where the employment is of a kind in which the remuneration of the 35 workers is ordinarily derived in the main from payments by persons other, than the employer, the Board may.fix a minimum time-rate for that class of workers in substitution for the time-rate which would otherwise he applicable;   40&apos; General minimum time-rates.
140B(iv) If the Board reports to the Minister that it is A.D. 1922. unnecessary or impracticable in any particular case to fix a general minimum time-rate in accordance with the provisions of this section, or 5 that it is unnecessary or impracticable that anysuch rate so fixed shall apply to any specified class of workers, the Minister may by order relieve the Board of its duty of fixing a general minimum time-rate in that particular case, or 10 may authorise the exemption of that class fromthe operation of the rate, as the case may require;(v) Different rates may be fixed for male and for female juvenile workers and for different classes15 of juvenile workers.(2) A Trade Board may fix : (a) General minimum rates (in&apos; this Act referred to as &quot; general overtime rates&quot;) for work done during employment determined as hereinafter 20 provided to be overtime employment, and-where a general overtime rate is fixed for any class of workers it shall be fixed with reference to the general minimum time-rate applicable to that class ; and25 (b) General minimum rates of wages for piece-workto apply to outworkers (in this Act referred to as &quot; outworkers general piece rates.&quot;)(3) For the purposes of this section the expression &quot; class of workers &quot; means any group of workers which 30 may be determined by the Trade Board with the consent of the Minister to be a class.6. Subject to the provisions of this section, the Basis rates, general minimum time-rate shall be the basis rate for piece-workers and for workers who are paid otherwise than35 at a fixed unit rate of wages, that is to say, the piece-rate of wages paid to a piece-worker of any class and the remuneration paid to any class of workers paid otherwise than at a fixed unit rate of wages, shall be such as to yield in the circumstances of the case to an ordinary worker at40 least the same amount of money as the general minimum time-rate fixed for workers of that class :
)Guaranteed time rates.A.D1i922.        Provided that-\a) the provisions of this section shall not apply to a piece-Avorker to whom any outworkers general piece-rate applies; and(b) -a Trade Board may if it thinks fit substitute for the general minimum time-rate some other rate as the basis rate and such other rate may be different either as respects piece-Avorkers or as respects workers paid otherwise than at a fixed unit rate of wages or as respects outworker? to whom no outworkers general piece-rates apply.7. For the purpose of securing either &quot;for piece-workers of any class (including workers to whom out-workers general piece-rates apply) or for Avorkers paid otherwise than at a fixed unit rate of wages a minimum amount of remuneration in respect of any period during which they are employed., a Trade Board may fix a minimum time-rate (in this Act /referred to as &quot;a guaranteed time-rate &quot;.) which shall not be higher than the appropriate general minimum time-rate.;8. Subject to the provisions of this Act, where any general minimum rate of wages has been fixed under the foregoing provisions of this Act and has been confirmed al by the Minister in ^accordance with, the provisions of the Fifth Schedule to this Act, an employer shall in cases to which the general minimum rate is applicable pay Avages to the person employed at not less than the general minimum&quot;rate clear of all deductions and if he fails to do so shall be guilty of an offence under this Act.Offence of not paying wages in accordance with goner minimum rates.1015202530In the foregoing provision, the expression &quot; deduc-tions&quot; includes any sum retained by an employer out of the wages of a worker, whether ;at the worker&quot; s request or not, and includes all deductions for or in respect of any matter AAdiatsoever (other than deductions under the Acts 35 relating sto national health insurance or unemployment insurance or deductions authorised by any Act to be made from wages in respect of -contributions to &quot;any super-annuation or other provident fund), and ^notwithstanding that they are deductions which may lawfully be made 40 from wages under the provisions of the Truck Acts, 1831
to 1896, and where any payment being a payment authorised to be received by an employer under section one, section two, or section three of the Truck Act, 1896, is made by any employed person to his employer, the 5 employer shall, for the purposes of the foregoing pro-vision, be deemed to have deducted that amount from wages.Grade Hates.9.-(1) In addition to any -rates fixed under the Power to fix 10 foregoing provisions of this Act (hereinafter referred to trade rates as general rates), a Trade Board may *fix such grade fSreed bs-. 5 ...       &quot; i it.- , ii    tweeu mem-mmimum   time-rates,   grade   basis   rates,   and   grade bers repre-guaranteed time rates for any specified grades of workers, seutiug em-as may be assented to by the members of the Board plovers and 15 representing employers and the members of the Board workmen-representing workers in manner provided in the Bart I. of the Third Schedule to this Act.- (2) A Trade Board may -fix such grade minimum piece rates for workers of any specified grades as may be 20 so agreed as aforesaid.(3) Any grade rate fixed under this section shall be determinable on notice being given either by the members representing employers or by the members representing workers in manner provided by Part II. of the said 25 Schedule.(4) A Trade Board may fix the rate of remuneration of workers who receive remuneration otherwise than by way of a fixed unit rate of wages, and such remuneration shall, for the purposes of the provisions of this Act 30 relating to grade rates, be deemed to be wages,10. Where an employer requests a Trade Board to Power to fix fix special grade piece rates for workers employed by -him, special grade the Trade Board may fix such special grade piece rates ^ieCy r^fS011 for those workers and in that case those special grade ^ employer. 35 piece rates shall apply as respects that employer instead of any other grade piece rates fixed under the last foregoing section.11. Where grade piece rates have been fixed under Saving from either of the last foregoing sections the employer of any liability ofemployerA.d.1922.

A Trade Board may fix grade minimum rates (intime rates.    this Act referred to as &quot; grade overtime rates &quot;) for work done by any specified grade workers during employ- 10 ment determined as hereinafter provided to be overtime employment, and where a grade overtime rate is fixed for any grade of workers it shall be fixed with reference to the grade minimum time rate or grade minimum piece rate applicable to that grade. 15Enforce- , 13. (l) Where a grade rate of wages has beenment of fixed under this Act and confirmed by the Minister in grade rates. accor(jauce with the provisions of the Fifth Schedule to this Act, then so long as the grade rate is in operation it shall, after the date on which the grade rate comes into 20 operation, be an implied terra of every contract (whether made before or after the date on which the grade rate comes into operation) for the employment of a worker of any grade to which the grade rate applies that the employer shall pay to that worker wages at not less than 25 the grade rate, and nothing in any contract for the employment of a worker to whom a grade rate applies shall operate to deprive the worker of his right to receive &apos; wages at that rate.(2) A Trade Board may on the application of an 30 employer or worker sanction the payment of wages in the case of any worker in viewr of special circumstances affecting him, or of special terms of the contract tinder which he works, at some other grade rate than the grade rate which would otherwise have been applicable to him 35 under this Act, and wdien such sanction is given this section shall apply as if such other grade rate were sub-stituted for the grade rate which would otherwise have been applicable:Provided that the grade rate so substituted shall not 40 be lower than the appropriate general rate.
