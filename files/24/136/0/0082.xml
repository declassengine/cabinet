IS DOCUMENT, IS THE PROPERTY,OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERHMBN T...CABINET.-  , . xEconomy (Ml 30 el lane ous Provisions) Bill. -! 1SET.Memorandum by the Minister of Health. .39B1. L.G.77..Clause 12 z Sale of Houses and land.The Committee on National Expenditure suggested that the Housing Acts should bo amend ed so as to give me a free hand as regards the sale of houses 9The only effective way o.f securing this, seeing that the houses are definitely in the ownership of the local authori-ties, would be to provide that I should have power to ,reduce the subsidy to any local authority who failed to take steps to secure such savings as it. might be p ess lb let &quot;for them to effect by soiling their houses,    The following clause has been drawn with this&apos; ob;j&amp;ctThe Minister may,, if it appears to him expedient, require a local authority to make arrangements for the sale of any houses forming part of a scheme t* the loss on which a contribution is or may be made by him out&apos; of moneys provided by Parliament, and if within a -period specified by the Minister the local authority fails to make any such arrangements or to sell the houses on such terms and conditlonsas, &quot;having regard to the circumstances of the case, appear to the Minister to be reasonable, the Minister may, with the consent of the Treasury, and notwithstanding anything in Section 7 of the Housing, Town Planning, etc Act, 1919, withhold the whole or any part of any contribution which would otherwise be payable under the said section. I do not, however, recommend that this clause ihauld be adopted.   I am quite clear that it would provoke the strongest opposition and that it would be impossible to carry it.It will be remembered that the Committee presided over t-P-WU- 1..
by the Lord Privy Seal came to the conclusion that a !polioy. of requlring general sale was not practicable, or desirable, and that this conclusion was endorsed by the Cabinet.&apos; -The Committee, however, recommended that the restrictions contained in the Housing Act&apos; against the free sale of houses and land should bo removed, and Clause..12 has been drafted with this object.... The repeal of the proviso to paragraph (d) of Section 15(1), of the Housing Act, 1919, gets rid of the requirement that It shall be a condition of any sale or lease.that tho houses shall not be used by any porson haying any Interest therein for the purpose of housing persons in his employment.     The repeal of this   proviso will no doubt give rlseto opposition, but I have inserted It in accordance with the recommendation of the Cabinet Committee.The repeal of Section 15(2) which Is necessary to give greater freedom In tho disposal of surplus land is a matter of great financial Importance.    The area of swplus land is very large and the annual charge on the Exchequer in respect of it is considerable.     I hftpe that it will.be possible to dispose of It without very serious loss and I am anxious to arrange for the sale or lease of this land on terms which will encourage builders to provide additional houses.     Section 15(2) of tho Housing Act, however, contains a provision that where land is sold or leased conditions must be imposed limiting the amount of rent which may be charged for any houses erected upon it, and I am advised that the existence of this requirement will prevent the disposal of the land within any reasonable time.I have considered the desirability of taking
Txrwer&quot;-defljiJLtely ^torrequire , local auihori t ies to dispose of-their surplus land.    There would not be much objection to &apos;this, as .,local authorities are generally accustomed to dealing with surplus: land, and are. usually prepared to get rid: of it or to appropriate it for other purposes.   I doubt however whether It is necessary as my powers of control through the subsidy are sufficient to enable me to deal with any cages when difficulty, arises.
Clause 2l(l) - Amendment of law as to recouping losseB on slum improvement schemes.This is a clause proposed by the Scottish Board of Health.The English and Scottish Housing Acts of 19113 provide in pradtically the same terms that approved slum Improvement schemes shall form part of a Ideal authorityfs State assisted housing scheme&apos;, towards which the State is&apos; required, subject to : certain regulations, to contribute the whole of the annual loss iri excess of the produce of a penny rate (In Scotland a rate of 4/5ths of a penny). * &apos; &apos;On the review of the State&apos;s commitments under the Housing Scheme in July last it was decided to limit the total contribution of the State towards the loss on slum improvement schemes to a maximum annual sum of  200,000 for England and Wales and of  30,000 for Scotland.The Scottish Board of Health hope to come to arrangement with the Scottish local authorities under which slum improvements schemes will be carried out, the cost being met partly by an annual payment by the Scottish Board of Health and partly by a contribution from the rates in addition to the 4/5ths of a penny contemplated by the Act of 1919.Under such an arrangement it is clear that the  30,000 available to the Scottish Board of Health could be made to cover a good deal more than if the whole of the loss on slum schemes had to be met from State mdneys.The existing law does not contemplate any such sharing of the expense between the State and the Local Authority, and the Intention of the Scottish clause is to secure clear legal authority for the arrangement, and to obviate whatever risk there may be of a local authority repudiating an agreement to make an additional contribution and claiming to have the full advantage given to it by the present law.     it is doubtful whether the clause as drawn quite carries out the intention,,  and some slightmodification/
modificat ion   would - probably be.necessary,&apos;   It will be observed that the clause does not define the basis on which the Scottish Board of Health will make their contribution&apos;, and it Is understood.that the Board are of opinion that their decisions as to contributions will be accepted by the Scottish local authorities.There ia something tq be said for the object of the clause which Is to secure that the money available for slum improvements shall be made to go as far as possible, and to place beyond doubt the propriety of arrangements to that end.     And although the circumstances of the two countries may differ somewhat it would clearly be very difficult to propose such a clause for Scotland and not make similar provision for England.My difficulty is, however, that to gain a comparatively small advantage we shall have to incur very serious, risk.     This clause would be the first formal breach in the scheme of State assistance to housing embodied in the Acts of 1919,     There will be therefore first the allegation of breach of. faith in a sphere where public opinion is still extremely sensitive.     Next, the opportunity will certainly be taken to raise the whole housing question, the limitation on schemes, the still unsatisfied need, the pledges to ex-service men.     I doubt whether the clause could be,-. got through without a full statement of the future plans of the Government as to housing and the present Is a most inopportune t ime for announc ing a policy.Broadly what we are aiming at is the resumption of private enterprise in working-class housing.     We have a year1 s work in hand, prices are steadily falling, and if we can continue on present lines till the end of the year, the position will be entirely changed.     There are, to my mind, very strong arguments against raising the issue at this moment.
Moreover, . so far as England is concerned, I am satisfied that the local authoritlea would not   be content to leave the basis of State contribution to slum schemes undefined. It will be remembered that when regulations as to. financial assistance under the Original Act were first hiade, the local authorities brought &quot;the question up in the House and forded the withdrawal of the original regulations and the adoption of others. The local authorities would probably press for some limit of their liability, or for some assurance that, a definite proportion of their loss should be borne by the State, and they would seek to extend the application of any new scheme to the case of the provision of\new houses.At the present time the large English local authorities are willing to make a start with slum clearance schemes but as a general rule only to the extent&apos; that they are covered by Exchequer contributions.     in some instances agreement can be secured to proceed on the basis of the local authority making some special contribution, and I think&quot;that we should take whatever small amount of risk there may be in accepting such, agreement a and regularise the position If necessary at a later date.I suggest that the Scottish Board of Health should follow a similar line and as they are satisfied that they would be able . to decide arbitrarily the amount of future State contributions, t conclude:that they will have no;difficulty In making arrangements for the Immediate oarrying out of schemes in agreement with the local authorities.     It may be mentioned that, the Committee on National Expenditure make ho recommendation on this point. .,
