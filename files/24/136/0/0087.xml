498Palazzo san giorgioThe meeting opened at 9.15 a. m. M. FACTA (Italy) inthe Chair.The PRESIDENT - soeaking in Italian:In accordance with Article 12 of the Rules of Proce-dure, as no objection has been made to the Minutes of the Second Plenary Meeting, which have been distributed, they are considered as adopted.I propose that the resolutions on the questions of fi-nance and of transport, which were approved at the Second Plenary Meeting of the Conference, shall be reprinted and annexed to the Minutes of the present Plenary Meeting. They will thus form Annexes 1 and 2 &quot;o these Minutes..If there is no objection, these motions will be consider-ed as adopted.*The motions were adopted.The PRESIDENT - speaking in Italian:I call upon M. Colrat, President of the Economic Com-nission, to speak.M. COLRAT. - (France) - speaking in French:The economic problems of the present day are of so vide and complicated a nature that the Commission of ivhich I have had the honour to be President might well lave found in its very title an excuse for ambitious resolu-ions. I wish my first words to be a tribute to the wisdom if the statesmen who have composed it. They have not udged it necessary, or even useful, to offer to a still bruised md suffering Europe the cold comfort of those high-flown  solutions which fall from the lips of theorists with an air jf oracular solemnity, They merely offer, in a frank and inpretentious spirit, advice based on long experience. These punsels are not being enunciated for the first time. Recent jvents, however, have shown that it is unwise to neglect or espise such counsels. The fact that they have stood the ist of long and painful experience is a proof of their truth ni vitality. The Third Commission of the Genoa Confe-:nce does not claim to have invented them. It has only re-leved them from the mass of misconceptions, which are as jicient as the counsels of common-sense, but far more dan-erous.Ij   First and foremost, the Commission has observed that Hain problems of world ec:autonomy, grave though they may call neither for joint discussion nor for common action. Lt a time when disorganisation and its disastrous conse-May ic/h 1022, at g a. m.quences are world-wide, nothing, perhaps, is more serious that the disorganisation of production. Almost everywhere, the war has created industries which cannot continue to thrive, by reason of the nature and habits of the countries in which they have been set up. Industries which were normal before the war have been developed to an abnormal and altogether excessive extent.There has thus arisen an economic nationalism which aims at producing everything, irrespective of the needs of consumption, and without consideration of the costs of pro-duction. The economic harmony of the world depended upon a just division of labour between peoples. It has been destroyed by a blind and presumputuous megalomania which the nations must recognise and eradicate. That, how-ever is a question - of national economy. Each nation must resolve it on its own account by the adjustment of its industry to its natural wealth and its acquired capabili-ties. The Commission has very rightly considered that it could not lay down binding rules for this adjustment, since they would necessarily be of a varying character. It would be vain to deny, and it is not without advantage to pro-claim, that this adjustment is desirable, and even urgently desirable, and that it is of the greatest importance for the general stability of international trade.The Commission has also judged it desirable to draw attention to the predominant part played by agricultural production in the reconstruction of Europe. The artificial industries of which I have spoken, by drawing the peasant classes away from the land, cause over-production on the one hand, and under-production on the other, thus resulting in a double evil. The whole world needs agricultural prosperity. It needs it, above all else, because under-production in agriculture results in famine. It is the unanimous opinion of the Economic Commission that one of the most effective means of restoring a state of healthy equilibrium to Europe is the equipment, instruction and betterment of the peasant classes. Its recommendation on this point is of the highest utility.No less importance must be attached to the resolutions regarding raw materials. Since 1916, the question of raw materials has become an extremely urgent one. During the war, the growing scarcity of these materials, the lack of foreign exchange and the shortage of tonnage caused many countries to buy, transport, and distribute in Common fuel, oil, fertilisers, textile raw materials and most kinds of min-erals. Immediately after the war, when markets were sud-denly freed from restrictions, the eagerness of buyers to international ECONOMIC CONFERENCEGENOVA  -  1922PROVISIONAL VERBATIM RECORDTHIRD PLENARY SESSION
satisfy their requirements, often real and sometimes imagi-nary, resulted in a considerable increase in prices. This had a double consequence; first, that manufacturers and middle-men no longer maintained normal stocks, and secondly, that consumers held back and restricted their purchases. After this wild boom came the slump. Today, prices for most raw materials, quoted in dollars, have returned to their 1913 level. The manufacturer and the middleman, however, are still at sea, whilst the buyer still holds aloof. The period of speculation following on the conclusion of peace has resulted in industrial, commercial and social tur-moil. In order to counteract it, countries have prohibited, restricted and heavily taxed the trade in raw materials. Countries are, of course, free to take these measures. They may dispose of their resources as they will, and devote them wholly to the national requirements, if they think it essential or if they fear a shortage. There is, however, a great temptation to abuse this right by converting measures of precaution into measures of aggression, extending to the superfluous what is only required for the necessary, and systematically selling to foreign manufacturers only under conditions which paralyse competition. The Commis-sion has endeavoured to find, and believes it has found, effective guarantees against such a system. 1 am happy to observe that, though they were first proposed by France at the opening of the Peace Conference, it was the persev-erance of M. Rossi which secured their acceptance at the Genoa Conference.The Economic Commission has endeavoured to deal with the problem of international trade in the most system-matic and practical fashion.The resumption of commercial intercourse between nations and the restoration of the channels of trade, which the war had obliterated or diverted, were undoubtedly an essential condition for the economic restoration of Europe.At the present time, taking as a basis of comparison the tonnage of goods exchanged in world trade rather than their values, which have undergone disproportionate changes, we find that world trade has fallen by one-half compared with 1913. We can hardly therefore be surprised by the falling off in production, by unemployment, by the stagnation of the raw materials market and by the glut in freights.It is true that the alarming fall in the purchasing power of the peoples impoverished by the war, or compelled to repair the damage caused by it, is the root cause of this pheno-menon ; but it must be admitted that the decrease in the volume of trade is also due to the artificial and restrictive regime which has been established in Europe since the war.This regime is partly due to the fact that territorial changes have broken up certain economic systems, which had been organised as a unit, without regard to racial autonomy and the divergence of political aspirations. Your Commission has felt bound to recommend the restoration, by means of Conventions and Agreements, of the old channels of trade, with the changes necessary to meet new European conditions.But the abandonment of the freedom of trade of bygone days has done more to multiply frontiers and to raise barriers than the changes made in the political map.I have already said that the concentration of economicforces during the war resulted almost everywhere in placfgJ ing in the hands of the State a considerable part of pro-duction and almost the whole of foreign trade. Control of foreign exchange, and consequently control of purchases in foreign countries, control and rationing of raw materials, control and co-ordination of national production, control and restriction of the consumption of foodstuffs, and of all ar-ticles of which there was a shortage, control and direction of exports, control and requisition of shipping;   all these combined to produce a sort of international State Socialism, the harmful effects of which continued for many long months.After the  conclusion of peace,   many countries still hoped to find salvation in an artificial economic system.It is true that the disturbances caused by the war urged them in this direction. The strongest had been weakened; the most active were without machinery or raw materials; the very inequality of conditions of production resulted in the adoption of unprecedented methods of trade, the con-sequences of which were aggravated by the instability of the exchanges.One cannot feel surprised that countries desired to protect themselves against the menace of stronger competi-tors. But during the last few months, protective customs tariffs have assumed forms which are particularly crastic and insidious, and which, though of little real use to the countries which they are intended to protect, expose other countries to unfair handicaps.It is time to return to a sounder economic system, more in accordance with the equitable treatment of com-merce which the Covenant of the League of Nations gua-rantees to all peoples.The peace of the world depends upon the restoration of the commercial treaties which united peoples, and of the methods which were followed in the conclusion of those treaties.In dealing- with tariffs, your Commission endeavoured to respect the freedom of the various countries, which must be able to direct their national economy and to provide their own fiscal resources as they please. It aimed&apos; merely at preparing the way for placing tariffs on a more stable basis. It has, however, arrived at a decision regarding cert-ain problems the solution of which is of importance for the reconstruction of Europe. I have referred to the guarantees contemplated for trade in raw materials. I must add the recommendation relating to the supplementary taxes on goods carried under a foreign flag, in other words, trade discri-. mination based on the nationality of the carrier. The arti-cles concerning import and export prohibitions embody a doctrine tending to restore more equitable and more liberal conditions, without ignoring the sovereign rights and special conditions of the various countries.With regard to agreements, the Commission did not con-fine itself to recommending the conclusion of commercial treaties. Convinced of the impossibility of removing by means of uniform regulalbns the inequality resulting the varying conditions of production and differences ir of exchange, it has defined the measures by which countries which are parties to agreements should comply with the re-quirements of the equitable treatment of commerce guaran-
499eed by the Covenant. The Commission did not wish at he present moment to impose an exclusive choice betweentie three theories on this subject, which divide the world, lie resolution which it has adopted permits of judicious ad-iistment to circumstances. The majority of the Commission ln4howed a preference for the most-favoured-nation system; jut it expressed this preference only in a note, thus indi-ating that it did not feel, under existing conditions, that ts views could be set up as a universal rule.Gentlemen, with this word of caution I conclude. You have now to discuss the recommendations which Kve submit to you. I can only ask you to adopt them as *our own. I know better than anyone the labours of which [they are the result.The Delegates of the nations represented at Genoa were all conscious of the solemnity of the moment and of [he importance of the discussions. Each one of them was the spokesman of a nation, and each one expressed the thought and the will of his people with the force of eloquence and the authority conferred by past services. Nevertheless, all aimed at incorporating that thought and that will, without mpairing them, in a common thought and a common will, jbecause each, in defending the interests of his own country, as desirous of contributing wholeheartedly to the restor-jation  of Europe. For Europe is to them not merely a geographical expression, not merely a vague and mystic super-fatherland&quot;. In their eyes, Europe towers above (he ruins of the present, in spite of everything, and repre-sents the great traditions of the past and the hopes of the future.ireflnisi nil re!; abl :e: thi ted thl lodj scrS art!iyionariicoi rcis5&quot; iroiatetri*i il iraiGentlemen, if this tradition is to be preserved, if this hope is to be realised, the workers in every factory in Europe must carry out their task, filled with pride in their iglits and rejoicing in the restoration of peace; manufacturers must evince a spiirt of moderation and justice; men of business must consider their word as their bond; and peoples as well as individuals must respect that great pact of moral reciprocity, of which Chesterton has so well said that it is the bridge over the abyss.May I be allowed to say, on this sacred soil, where international law has its origin, that Europe is based upon espect for treaties? To fail in such respect would be to work against Europe and against the spirit by which the Delegates of the nations assembled at the Genoa Confe-rence have been animated.The PRESIDENT - speaking in Italian: I call upen M. Rossi, Delegate of Italy, to speak.M. ROSSI (Italy) - speaking in Italian:The President of the Economic Commission has furnish-ed us with a clear explanation of, and an interesting com-mentary upon, the resolutions which are submitted for the approval of this Assembly.Thanks to his explanation, we have all been enabled ,to form an idea of the great importance of these resolutions, [and of the liberal spirit in which they are conceived.I have no wish to add anything to the succinct remarksof the President of the Economic Commission, but perhaps, in view of the fact that, as President of the Italian Dele-gation in the Economic Commission, I have poposed and defended the most liberal measures in questions of econo-mic policy, I may be allowed to dwell for a moment upon the great importance of the resolutions which have been adopted, and upon the immense advantages which may be derived from them if they are accepted, and unconditionally applied without delay by the Governments.Gentlemen, if we compare the economic policies follow-ed by the various countries before the war with those which have been followed since the war, and which are still unfortunately in force, we cannot but be grieved by the spirit of protectionism, intolerance, and I would almost say, exclusion, which prevails in the world of economics.Before the war, import and export prohibitions were almost exclusively prohibited by commercial treaties. It was re-cognised that all measures of restriction were incompatible with economic co-operation between nations, tending as they did to prevent the agricultural and industrial products of one nation from entering the territory of others, and to prevent the raw materials of one country from going freely to other countries which had need of them. To-day, import and export prohibitions established during the war for reasons of prime necessity, still exist in several coun-tries, and are regarded as essential for economic and finan-cial reconstruction. Such restrictions, however, form a bar-rier to international commerce, characteristic of this disastrous-trous pre-war period, and at the same time a weapon of ecc-nomic policy which is used as often for offensive as for defensive purposes.Before the war, even the highest customs duties only represented a small percentage of the value of the goods. To-day, some of the customs duties in force actually exceed the total value of the goods; they are measures of prohibi-tion rather than of protection.Before the war, it was an established principle that all commercial treaties should be based upon the most-favoured-nation clause; it was. recognised that sound international trade must infallibly be based upon equality of treatment. Since the war, the economic policies followed by the various countries have departed further and further from a princi-ple which is indispensable for free competition in the inter-national market, and for the most advantageous results in matters of general economy.What have been the effects, the results of this policy of economic exclusion?We all know and regret such results. Whilst the coun-tries which are economically weakest, and whose currency is most depreciated, have required increased production and export to improve their economic conditions and to secure the appreciation of their currency, the barriers raised against them by countries with stable currencies have obliged them to reduce their production and to diminish their exports, with the inevitable and well-known consequences of unem-ployment, growing instability of their trade balance, and fi-nally, further depreciation of their currency.Thus the countries with a stable currency, thinking to defend themselves against the competition of countries with a depreciated currency, have only accentuated the condition of temporary advantage which they hold over the latter as
a direct result of the instability of the exchanges. They have, moreover, done their utmost to decrease the purchasing power of countries with a depreciated currency, and by that means to reduce their own possibilities of export.Countries with a depreciated currency, on the other hand, thinking to defend their own economic system and in-crease the value of their currency, have surrounded them-selves with increasingly impenetrable barriers, thus providing countries with a stable exchange with a new excuse for raising fresh barriers against them.The vicious circle which connects debtor and creditor countries must be broken: step by step, we must regain that freedom in international trade by which alone we can emerge from the crisis through which we are passing, and, when the crisis is passed, ensure to the nations the great-est measure of economic well-being.The proposals which I have had the honour of submit-ting to the Conference on behalf of the Italian Delegation all make for the recognition of that economic solidarity which unites even countries which are politically divided, and for the restoration, within reasonable limits, of the free competition in the international economic field which is the source both of economic well-being and of social progress.Allow me also to observe that the proposals submitted by the Italian Delegation were not of a merely theoretical character, but, as far as the difficult conditions at present prevailing allowed, were entirely in harmony with the eco-nomic policy which Italy has followed and intends to follow.Italy has also, during the war, been compelled, by rea-sons connected with her most vital interests to have re-course to very rigorous restrictive measures. She was also, immediately after the war, compelled to take account of the changed economic and industrial conditions, and to adopt the necessary customs provisions.The restrictive measures adopted during the war have now, however, been almost entirely abolished, and the eco-nomic and customs policy adopted by Italy is the same which in the past made possible fruitful economic agree-ments between different countries.The proposals of the Italian Delegation have all been approved in principle, but have been qualified by various limitations and reservations which were rendered inevitable by the different conditions prevailing in the various countries represented at the Conference, and by the necessity of pas-sing gradually from a system of economic policy bristling with barriers and obstacles, to the most liberal system pos-sible.It is a most significant and important fact that the lib-eral principles proposed by the Italian Delegation have met with the unanimous approval of various countries where economic conditions are so different.The Genoa Conference constitutes not only the clearest pronouncement as yet made in favour of a return to that eco-nomic collaboration and solidarity which existed before the war, and which contributed so powerfully to the progress of Europe, but also the most authoritative condemnation of the restrictive systems which have been one of the principal causes of the evils from which we are all suffering.It is therefore legitimate to affirm that the work accom-plished in the economic sphere by the Genoa Conference is of incalculable importance, and is destined to exert the most favourable influence on international trade.At the last sitting, my eminent colleague, M. Schanzer, after calling attention to the efforts made by Italy to reduce her budget expenses, made the following statement:&quot; We have considered the reduction of our expenditure not only as a duty towards ourselves, but also as a duty . towards other nation?,&apos; whose normal economic life and prosperity are intimately bound up with the economic and political stability of each member of international society &quot;,Allow me to say, Gentlemen, that these words may also with perfect justice be applied to the economic policy which Italy has consistently followed, and for which she has endeavoured to win acceptance at the Genoa Conference.Allow me also to express, together with the satisfaction which I feel at the explicit and authoritative recognition given by the Conference to these principles, the hope that each country, not only in its own interest, but also in the interest of the other members of international society, will renounce that policy of economic exclusiveness which is contrary to the material well-being of the nation?, and to their complete pacification.Intimately connected with economic questions are labour questions, and in regard to these I will ask you to allow me to make certain statements on behalf of the Italian Delegation.The Italian Delegation, while welcoming the formulation by the Economic Commission of solemn resolutions dealing with labour questions, would have preferred that the atten-tion of all States should have been drawn in a more explicit manner, and without reservation, to the desirability of adhering to the draft Conventions and Recommendations adopted by the International Labour Conferences.Italy cannot refrain from reaffirming on this occasion her profound confidence in, and her unconditional sympathy with international social legislation, and with the Organisation created by the Peace Treaty for the elaboration of such legislation. The votes given by the Italian Government Delegates at the International Labour Conferences in favour of the various draft Conventions and Recommendations, represent for the Government and for the Italian nation a moral obligation of the highest order; and the Italian Par-liament, which has recently authorised the Government to ratify several of these Conventions, and particularly the Washington Convention concerning Unemployment, is pre-paring to examine the other conclusions of the Labour Con-ference in the same favourable spirit towards the deve-development  of international legislation for the protection of the workers, which should animate democracies in general, especially in countries interested in emigration and immigration movements.The desire for an equitable and adequate protection of emigrants inspired a proposal submitted by the Italian Dele-gation with the object of securing the traditional currents of emigration, and special facilities for skilled workers.The Italian Delegation was most anxious that these principles should be accepted, and is confident that they will finally prevail in the future. Italy, for her part, is glad to be able to state that her services of State supervision of emigration, co-ordinated with the international labour exchange and unemployment services, will enable her to assist in the most effective manner in the rational employment of the forces of labour.
ij G 0The Italian Delegation, which advocated a resolution of sympathy for Co-operative institutions, which was not accepted by the Commission, desires finally to express its gratitude for the co-operation in the work of the Genoa Conference offered by the workers, who have made their voice heard through the medium of the international co-operative and trade union organisations, in which institutions the workers cultivate a sense of their own responsibilities and learn by experiment to appreciate the other factors which contribute to production in close union with labour.Gentlemen, the fundamental principle inspiring all the economic resolutions is the return to freedom of trade. The fundamental principle inspiring the labour resolutions is the moral and social elevation of the workers. These two great principles constitute the basis of that economic and social progress which, arrested for a moment by the the Great War, must resume its march and accelerate its course for the well-being of humanity and the pacification of the nations.The PRESIDENT - speaking in Italian:I call upon M. Rathenau, Delegate of Germany, to speak.M. RATHENAU (Germany) - speaking in French:The conclusion of the economic labours of this Confer-ence allows us to consider the historic value of a werk which will be more and more appreciated as the years come and go and in return for which the gratitude of the whole of Europe is secured for the Genoa Conference. Nevertheless, it would be undue optimism to expect that the conclusion of these labours can bring a remedy of a notable and immediate kind to the crises from which the whole world is suffering. The situation of the world will only be really improved when the soundness of certain principles is recognised   principles which have been clearly shown during the delib-considerations of the Commissions, and with ever - increasing clearness, although they have not been completely expres-sed in the Resolutions adopted. Whilst confining myself within the limits set to the labours of the Conference, I will try to point out four truths which, although they have not been expressly stated, seem (o me to result from our delibera-tions, and which, I believe, are the necessary foundations for the re-establishment of the economic status of the world. The first of these truths is the following:- the total indebted-ness of the several countries is too great, compared to their productive ability. All the leading countries, of econo-mic importance find themselves enclosed in a circle of in-debtedness which makes them almost all, at the same time, creditors and debtors. In their capacity as creditors, these countries do not know how much they will recover of the sums due to them. In their capacity as debtors, they do not know how much they owe, and how much they will be able to pay. This is why there is not a country to-day which can draw up a budget based on real facts. There is not a country to-day which can risk creating large new institutions to improve its national economy and to fertilise the world&apos;s markets. There is not a country which can hope to stabi-lise its budget and the rate of its exchange, with the one exception of that great country which is a debtor to nobody,and which is a creditor of all, and without the help of which the final restoration of Europe is impossible.More especially, the countries which are apparently overburdened with debt cannot obtain the &apos; means which they need. On the one hand, no new creditor is willing to give them new credits; on the other, already overburdened with debt, they would not dare to accept such credits. Never-theless, if the States were indebted one to the other, all these debts would be proportioned to their productive capacities, and would correspond, moreover, to their produc-tive investments, whereas the debts that exist at present reach figures in excess of those that Hie States in question are able to reimburse over a period covering several decades. These debts do not, therefore, represent financial realities. They do, however, represent economic realities, inasmuch as they hinder the process of world production.Consequently, the only way that remains open is the one adopted by individuals in their economic relations, in cases where the debts of an undertaking exceed its produc-tive capacity. That is to say, the only way is the gradual rehabilitation and reduction of indebtedness.The second of these truths, which has not been stated at Genoa, seems to be the axiom that no creditor should prevent his debtor from repaying his debts. When an indi-vidual owes money to another, he can insist that the re-payment shall be made in a certain curreHcy. It is the bus-iness of the debtor to procure this currency, which within certain limites can always be obtained on the world market. But when it is a question of a country being indebted to another country, it is not possible in the long run to reim-burse these debts in gold. If that country does not produce gold, or does not possess enough gold, it can only effect repayment in goods. Repayment in goods, however, is only possible in so far as the creditor allows it. When the cre-ditor objects to such repayment in goods, the insolvency of the debtor will soon follow. If the creditor, instead of facilitating, prevents this method of payment by imposing Customs duties and other obstructive measures, the total of the debt will be arbitrarily increased, for it will be ne-cessary to produce yet more goods. The depreciation of the means of payment automatically increases the total amount of the debt.Each country desirous of receiving payment, should therefore grant its debtors facilities of import such as will enable them to reimburse their debts without unduly increa-sing them.The third truth has been brought out yet more clearly than the others. It is that which is comprised in the theory which says that world economy can only be re-established with the re-establishment of an imponderable quantity, that is to say, mutual confidence. But this confidence will only return to the world, when mankind is living in real peace. If the present condition of the world is not one of war, it nevertheless resembles war in many respects, and in any case, it is not a real peace. Unfortunately, in many countries, public opinion is not yet demobilised. The after-effects of war propaganda have not yet disappeared, and they still render the atmosphere heavy. That is why anyone who trusts his money and his labour to a country has to run the risk that circumstances beyond his control, the cause of which cannot be sought in natural phenomena, but which
depends on political events, may in a short time modify or damage the situation of the country in question. The world is still far from having recognised that an impoverished debtor needs to be treated kindly, and that he becomes incapable of payment if his last resource   his credit   is destroyed.Indeed, these imponderable forces which hinder exchange, formerly so active, in the process of world production and consumption, are evident from the fact that the means of world production have remained almost what they were before the war. Even if we take into account all the distress-ing and deplorable ravages of the war, and also of the per-iod since the war, we may still hold that more than ninety per cent,of the total means of production of the world and of the total system of world business still exists.As far as the enormous and deplorable destruction which has occurred in the interior of Russia is concerned, it only affects world trade to the extent ot three per cent. In spite of the terrible loss of human life occasioned by the war, even the forces of human production have been preserved for the most part: for human necessities have fil-led up the gaps in a proportionate measure.We can therefore say that the mechanism of the world is not working, although the substance and the motive power are aim ?st intact. On the one hand, millions of labourers are condemned to unemployment: on the other hand, millions of human beings are suffering from hunger. On the one hand, enormous quantities of merchandise are accumulated and unsaleable: and on the other hand, there is a crying need for this same merrhandise. Whence come these phenomena? To say nothing of reciprocal indebtedness, which in itself contains a psychological factor, these phenomena result from other psychological factors, determined by the lack of real peace and by the lack of mutual and universal confidence. Whem we ask if the means exist to revive commercial exchanges between the several countries of the world, and to start once more the mechanism of world production, we come inevitably to the fourth point, which has not been stated, but which I wish to make.It will be seen that it is not sufficient to have the ef-forts of one nation, or of two nations, to revive the whole of world economy, but for this purpose we need the colla-boration of all nations. Thus, how is it possible, after a series of unparallelled destructions, for the world to be cured, unless all the nations of the world consent to a common sacrifice? Only world-wide sacrifices can help this suffering world to recovery. Reconstruction has never been possible without finding new funds. Such funds, however, cannot be found so long as each unit in the system of world economy is, with few exceptions, in debt, The first sacrifice that all should make should consist in reducing the great circle of reciprocal indebtednes. But there is a further sacrifice to be made: to use all efforts to find the ample funds required for purposes of reconstruction, either by means of universal and mutual credits, or by other means, into the details of which we cannot go to-day.That the Genoa Conference has brought all the nations of Europe together to discuss and to understand the bear-ing of these questions, is a fact which will remain memor-able in the history of Europe. Another result of historic importance is the fact that a rapprochement has been effectedwith the great Russian people, so grievously tried, and that Russia has been once more brought into contact with the other European nations. The members of the German Delegation are happy to have contributed to the best of their ability in conciliating the several points of view. Germany hopes- that the labours of Genoa will form the basis for a real work of peace between the East and the West. Thanks toj the protection and the assistance which Italy has granted to this work of peace, this magnanimous nation has acqui-red a right to the deep gratitude of the whole world. The history of Italy is an ancient one, more ancient than that of most European nations. More tham one great world move-ment has had its origin on this glorious soil, and once morei let us hope that the peoples of the world are raising their eyes and their hearts, and not in vain, to this Italy, with the fervent hope which Petrarch expressed in his immortal words:s Io vo gridando: O pace! pace! pace!The PRESIDENT - speaking in Italian:If nobody wishes to speak, the debate on the motions is closed. I will put the motions to the vote, with the reservations which certain Delegations which to make.Since M. Tchitcherin wishes to speak, I call upon him to do so.M. TCHITCHERIN (Russia) - speaking in French:Now that the moment has come for the Economic Commission to pass its resolutions, I cannot refrain from recalling the main objections which were formulated by the Russian representatives in the course of the labours of the Commission.I cannot but repeat that the Russian Delegation finds abnormal in the highest degree the fact that the composition of the technical Committee which had to deal with questions of labour should have been fixed by the personal decision of the President of the first Sub-Committee.M. COL RAT (France) - speaking in French : I wish to speak.M.  TCH1TCHER1N (Russia) - speaking in French:....and the fact that amongst the members of this Committee there should have been included no repre-sentatives of Russia. The Russian Delegation has already: protested against its exclusion from the technical Committee, The fact is all the more strange because the very con-stitution of the Russian Republic is founded on labour organisations. The results of this exclusion are visible. Chapter VI of the Report of the Economic Commission, which deals with labour questions, opens with a general remark stating the importance of the assistance of the workers in&apos; the economic restoration of Europe. Yet we do not find in this chapter what would be most necessary to the working classes. We do not find a mention of the legislation for the protection of workmen, leaving aside the question of unemployment. We do not find either any proposal qui-cernihg co-operative societies, although the latter are an instrument of the highest value for the improvement of the

COLRAT (France) - speaking in French:The Russian Delegate having directly and personally ntroduced the name of the President of the Commission into pie debate, I must answer him in two word;. It is not sact to say that the Russian Delegates were excluded rorn the Sub-Committee on labour questions. What is right that they did not sit amongst the reduced Committee. I will late the reason, and M. Tchitcherin will find that, if he as not included, he was in very good company amongst fiose who did not sit. The reason was this. We found that fie Members of the Russian Delegation came so rarely &apos; attend the debates on labour questions, that we thoughtthat they were not particularly qualified to take part in the discussion. As regards the general charges which have been brought against the Commission, my colleague here wlil not permit me to answer them in full. All I will say is this, that the Head of the Russian Delegation is little qualified, in the present economic state of his country, to come and try to give lessons to other peoples.The PRESIDENT - speaking in Italian:I call upon M. Motta, Delegate of Switzerland, to speak :M. MOTTA (Switzerland) speaking in French: I have listened hitherto in silence to the debate on the Report of the Economic Commission. It was my intention to keep silence to the end, in the desire to preserve on this occasion a proper spirit of modesty. But an allusion has been made, in the declarations of the Head of the Russian Delegation, to the action of my country in the matter of the Washington Conventions, and that allusion I cannot allow to pass without comment. I would &quot;point out that the atti-tude of the Swiss Government with regard to the Washington Conventions is known. It has been loyally communicated to the Labour Office. It has been communicated to the several Commissions here, so that the attitude is really clearly known. I cannot, however, &apos;allow this misunderstanding to which the remarks of the Russian Delegate may have given rise, to pass without notice. While the Swiss Gov-ernment considers that the Washington Conventions are perhaps too schematic, too cout-and-dried for thi need a of the case, I wish to point out that the eight-hours day exists in Switzerland in industries and in the public services. But the Swiss Government wishes to retain the right to modify, if necessary, and to see the results of the legis-lation concerning hours of work, and to make any modi-ficatons which experience may show to be necessary in adapting that legislation to real needs. I would point out that I am not here as a representative of a class. I am here as the representative of the whole of my country, and while my country may not consider that the present legislation is final, though it may need amending and adapt-ing to circumstances, I must point out that the Swiss Government aims at a broad humanitarian policy and that my country is essentially a democracy   the oldest de-mocracy in Europe   and one in which the interests and needs of all classes, and especially of the working classes, are fully taken into consideration.The PRESIDENT - speaking in Italian:I do not think it is necessary to continue the debate. The resolutions of the Economic Commission will therefore be considered as adopted, with the reservations which arc noted in the Minutes of the Meetings of the Commission and Sub-Commissions.These reservations will be inserted in the definitive edition of the Report of the Commission.The Resolutions in question will form Annex 3 to the Minutes of this Meeting.We will now pass to the resolutions of the First Commission.I call upon the Rapporteur, M. Schanzer, Delegate of Italy, to speak.conditions of the working classes. It is to the highest degree to be regretted that, in the course of the labours of the First Sub-Committee, the proposal about co-operatives should have been rejected. But there is some-thing else. Article 21, which mentions the Conventions of the Labour Conference of Washington, deprives those Con-ventions of a great part of their practical importance by onfirming the right of the members not to ratify them. This final phrase of Article 21, which the Russian Delegation in vain tried to suppress, is explained by the desire of cer-tain Governments, such as Switzerland, notto accept the eight-hour day. The Russian Delegation considers the eight-hour day as a fundamental principle of the welfare of the work-crs, and raises a formal objection against the liberty expli-citly given to the Governments not to apply it. In the same way, when the Conference was presented with a memoran-dutn of the International Federation of the Amsterdam Trade Unions, stating that a minimum of social justice as regards the workers was the indispensable condition of the restoration of peace, this memorandum was not even taken into consideration.The Russian Government, which does not recognise the League of Nations, cannot either recognise its International Labour Office. But this does not in any way modify its point of view on the flaws in the decisions of the Economic Commission on labour questions. All the other objections or reservations which our Delegate has raised against the decisions of the Commission remain in force so far as we arc concerned. I also repeat here specially the reservations Iready made as regards the labours of the second and the First Commissions, regarding the full and entire freedom of action which Russia will retain as regards the provisions which entrust the League of Nations with official missions. Lastly, the Russian Delegation must state that the gen-eral impression left by the Report of the Economic Commission is that it is shorn of that boldness which \i indispensable if it is really intended to undertake the work of general reconstruction. A whole set of measures is needed, a new&apos; political orientation such as I have sketched its main lines at the opening session of the Genoa Con-erence. It is with these reservations and objections that the Russian Delegation, while declining to accept certain details, accepts the Report of the Economic Commission in its entirety.
M. SCHANZER (Italy) - speaking in French:I have the honour to submit for the approval of the Conference the document which was approved yesterday by the First Commission, and which refers to the continuation at the Hague of the discussions begun at Genoa with the representatives of the Russian Soviet Republic, with the ob-ject of reaching an agreement on the questions of debts, private property, credits, and of a pact of non-aggression.I think I should give the Conference a brief description of the various phases of the discussion of the Russian ques-tion, from the beginning up to the present time, and explain how the Commission came to adopt the document which I am submitting.The first phase of the discussion of the Russian ques-tion began at the first meeting of the Sub-Commission, when the Memorandum drawn up by the Allied Experts in London was submitted to the Russian Delegates, as a basis for the settlement of the three groups of questions which it was necessary to solve in order to reach a general agreement with Russia, that is to say;-liquidation of the past, condi-tions for the future, and measures to facilitate an immediate economic reconstruction of Russia.Private meetings took place between the Russian De-legates and the representatives of the countries whose ex-perts had drawn up the Memorandum. During these meetings it was endeavoured to settle questions relating to the liquid-dation of the past.A short Memorandum, setting forth the principles for the solution of the questions of debts and property, was drawn up on April 15, and submitted to the Russian Delegation, which replied by the Note of April 20.A special Committee of Experts was set up immediately to continue the discussions with the Russian Delegation on the basis of the Note submitted on April 20.The Experts held four meetings, on April 22, 23 and 24, but it appeared clearly from their discussions that the two parties were not yet within sight of agreement.On the basis of the document submitted by the Russian Experts at the meeting of April 24, and with the addition of certain considerations dealing with the Russian problem as a whole, and certain conditions which were essential for a renewal of economic relations with Russia, a Memorandum was drawn up and submitted to the Russian Delegation on May 2. M. Tchitcherin replied to this Memorandum in his note addressed to the President of the Sub-Commission on the 11 th instant.This reply was considered inacceptable. The Sub-Com-mission, however, discussed the possibility of setting up Commissions of Experts to continue elsewhere the work begun at Genoa.In the document which I have the honour to submit to you, the Sub-Commission has, in fact, agreed to propose the establishment of a non-Russian Commission and a Rus-sian Commission, to meet at the Hague on June 26,- and endeavour to solve the questions of debts, private property and credits.The President of the Genoa Conference, in accordance with the wishes of the Commission, will invite the countries represented at Genoa to be present at the Hague meeting. He has informed the Government of the United States of America of the decision which has been reached, expres-sing the hope that it will take part in the Hague meeting Unfortunately, the Washington Government has felt itself unable to accept the invitation to take part in the work at the Hague.We all  realise the great advantages of solving  th Russian problem at the earliest possible moment. With this object in view, the Commissions of Experts are to meet on June 26, and their work is to be  limited to a period  of three months.In the document which deals with the establishment of the Hague Commissions and lays down their programme o work, the Commission has also included the pact of nor aggression between Russia and the other Powers which accept the proposal. This has been done in order to allow the Commisions to work in an atmosphere of mutual con fidence and tranquillity: it is, moreover, an affirmation of the programme of peace and pacification upon which the Conference of Genoa has been based.I.The Powers mentioned above agree that a Commission shall be appointed for the purpose of further consideration of the outstanding differences between the Russian Soviet Government and the other Governments, and for the purpose of meeting a Russian Commission similarly empowered.II.The names of the Powers represented in the non-Russian Commission, together with the names of the members of the Commission, will be communicated to the Soviet Go vernmenl&quot;, and the names of the members of the Rnssian Corn-mission wi 1 be communicated to the other Governments not later than June 20.III.   .The matters to be dealt with by these Commissions will comprise all outstanding questions relating to debts, private property and credits.IV-The members of the two Commissions will be at the Hague on June 26, 1922.V.The Commissions will endeavour to arrive at joint recommendations on the matters dealt with in Clause HI-VI.In order to enable the work of the Commissions to be carried on in tranquillity, and in order to restore mutual confidence, engagements will be entered into binding the Russian Soviet Government and the Governments now allied with the Russian Soviet Government on the one hand, and the other participating Governments on the other hand, to refrain from all acts of aggression against their respective territories, and to refrain from subversive propaganda.
502The pact to refrain from acts of aggression will be founded on the observance of the existing status quo, and will remain in force for a period of four months from the closing of the work of the Commissions.The agreement against propaganda will bind all the signatory Governments to abstain from interfering in any way in the internal affairs of other States, from supporting by financial or other means political organisations at work in other countries, and also to suppress in their territory attempts to foment acts of violence in other States, and attempts which might disturb the territorial and political status quo.As will be seen from the explanations which I have given, it has not been possible in this Conference to arrive at a complete solution of the problem which was confided to our Sub-Commission. It is not necessary to go into the reasons for this. They are chiefly of a practical order. We are not, however, abandoning our task. It will be continued by the Commissions which we propose should be formed. Our confidence in the final solution of the great problem remains unshaken.The torch of that confidence is not extinguished: Genoa will pass it on to the Hague.Allow me to say one word more on the last part of the Draft Resolution, that is to say, on the pact of non-aggres-sion. As it stands, this pact is of a purely temporary character. In order to make clear the obligations which the parties were to undertake, it was found necessary to fix a limit of time for the pact, which limit is connected with the labours of the Commissions.But I desire to say plainly that, in proposing this tem-porary pact of non-aggression, we cherish the strongest hope that, at its termination, a more general and more permanent pact will be substituted for it, and that the ideal towards which we are working, the ideal of uniting all nations in a single great organisation for peace, will become a reality within the shortest possible time.The PRESIDENT - speaking in Italian:I call upon M. Platijn, Delegate of the Netherlands, to speak.M. PLATIJN (Netherlands) - speaking in French:It is a great honour for me to be able to state that my Government will be delighted to give every facility to the Commissions which, in accordance with the decision of the First Commission to hold a Conference of Experts, will come to the Hague in a few weeks&apos; time, to continue the study of the questions involved in the Russian problem. My Government will be happy to grant these Commissions every facility for working at the Hague, as the place on which the unanimous choice of the Conference has fallen. The Dutch have always considered it a duty to offer gener-ous hospitality to meetings which have for their aim the improvement of international relations and the laying of foundations for peace. The Government of the Netherlands will most cordially receive the Commissions, which will resume their meetings from the Conference of Genoa, seeing that this Conference considers their meeting necessary in the interests of the reconstruction of Europe. We do not deny that the task which will be  ours, &quot;although an agreeabieone, will be rendered difficult by the fact that you will come to us having still in mind the brilliant recep-tion and hospitality offered to you by the Italian Govern-ment. I assure you, however, that the Commissions will find at- the Hague that international atmosphere which the Prime Minister of Great Britain kindly mentioned the other day as the reason for the selection of the Hague. The Prime Minister graciously reminded you of its long and ve-nerable tradition, dear to the heart of the Hague. While wishing many of you a cordial greeting on the soil of the Netherlands, I wish at the same time to express the earnest desire that complete success may crown the work of the Commissions. May their labours contribute to producing friendly relations betueen all peoples, and play their part in the economic reconstruction of Europe, which is still suf-fering so grievously.The PRESIDENT - speaking in Italian: I call upon M. Galvanauskas, Delegate of Lithuania, to speak.M. QALVANAUSKAS (Lithuania) - speaking in French: The obstacles to the reconstruction of Europe, whether they are political or moral, do not consist merely in the non-settlement of European relations with Russia. The Lithua-nian Delegation believes it has performed its duty in em-phasizing this fact before all the Commissions. It has pointed out the impossible position in which it is placed by reason of the military front which Poland presents to it, so that it cannot apply, as regards that State, the decisions of the Conference regarding economic, financial and transport questions. Poland, by the forcible act of General Zeligowski, violated the Convention with Lithuania concluded at Suwalki, and also its obligations towards the League of Nations. In defiance of Treaties in force, Poland continues its military occupation of Lithuanian territory, and of the capital, Vilna.The PRESIDENT - speaking in Italian: The subject on which the Lithuanian Delegate is speak-ing not being before the Assembly, I must ask him to sit down.M. QALVANAUSKAS (Lithuania) - speaking in French: That is why the Lithuanian Delegation is obliged to make reservations as regards Clause VI adopted by the First Commission. This Clause appears to us to be inacceptable by reason of the peril which would result from a legalisa-tion, even if only temporary, of the territorial and political status quo created in Lithuania by the aforesaid violations of existing Treaties and of international law.It is with sincere regret that we feel compelled to make these reservations, the only cause of which is the policy of Poland in regard to our country. The general policy which Lithuania has followed has always been one of peace, and we desire to declare solemnly that she will never abandon that policy. The Lithuanian Delegation desires also to call the attention of the Conference to the fact that its Govern-ment has proposed, and now again proposes to Poland a peaceful means for the settlement of these differences, in conformity with law and existing agreements. Thus, the Li-thuanian Government recently proposed to Poland to appear before the Permanent Court of International Justice. Un-fortunately, however, Poland declined this invitation.
The PRESIDENT - speaking in Italian:&apos;I must ask the Lithuanian Delegate not to persist in addressing the Assembly.I believe I am interpreting the opinions of all in thanking the Delegate of the Netherlands very warmly for the generous way in which he has expressed the feelings of his Govern-ment with regard to the reception of the Expert Commis-sions which are to continue in his country the labours be-gun at Genoa. I feel sure that the cordiality with which the Delegate of the Netherlands has welcomed them is an excellent augury for the success of the work which will be continued there, and in the name of the Assembly, I thank him most sincerely for what he has said.I now call upon M. Skirmunt, Delegate of Poland, to speak.M. SKIRMUNT (Poland) - speaking in French:I do not want to enter into a controversy with the representative of Lithuania. I merely wish to mention certain facts. Negotiations were set on foot by the League of Na-tions for the settlement of the Polish-Lithuanian dispute, and terminated on January 13. It was proposed to the two countries that diplomatic and consular relations should be established between them, and that the neutral zone should be replaced by a provisional frontier line.We have accepted the two recommendations of the League of Nations; only yesterday, the League of Nations again dealt with this question, and again recommended that we should divide the neutral zone between the two coun-tries and send a Commission to the spot. The representative of Poland accepted the decisions of the Council of the League of Nations. If the representative of Lithuania does not think it possible, on his side, to accept paragraph VI of the proposal which is now before us, the Lithuanian Go-vernment will take the responsibility, but that will not in any way affect the pacific attitude of Poland towards the Lithuanian Government, and the sentiments of the Polish people towards the Lithuanian people.We never attack, we are always ready to have neigh-bourly relations with Lithuania, and even to recognise the Lithuanian Government as existing de jure. Our feelings are entirely pacific; I am anxious to state this and to declare in all solemnity.The PRESIDENT - speaking in Italian:As this question was set aside at the meeting of the First Commission yesterday, it is not within my power to allow it to he taken up here.I will now call upon the Russian Delegation to state that it accepts the resolutions read out by M. Schanzer, in-cluding the pact of non-aggression contained in Article VI..   M. TCHITCHERIN (Russia) - speaking in French:The Russian Delegation has stated, in the meeting of the Commission, its attitude in this matter, and has given all necessary explanations with regard to the resolutions now submitted to the Conference. I do not wish to delay our labours here this morning, and I therefore refer you to the statements and reservations made before the Corn-mission, and declare that the Russian Delegation accepts the resolutions, including Article VI, subject thereto. ..I       The PRESIDENT - speaking in Italian:I call upon the Delegate of Great Britain to make a Statement on the subject of the acceptance of the resolu-modifications before the Assembly, and of the pact of non-aggres-sion.Mr. LLOYD GEORGE (Great Britain) - speaking in English:We accept the pact of non-aggression, with the elu-cidation contained in the Minutes.The PRESIDENT - speaking in Italian:I call upon the Delegate of Canada to speak.The Delegate of Canada - speaking in English: The Representative of the Dominion accepts, with the reservations and explanations given in the minutes.The PRESIDENT - speaking in Italian:I call upon the Delegate of Atistralia to speak.The Delegate of Australia - speaking in English: I accept.The PRESIDENT - speaking in Italian:I call upon the Delegate of New Zealand to speak.The Delegate of New Zealand - speaking in English: I accept.The PRESIDENT - speaking in Italian:I call upon the Delegate of South Africa to speak.The Delegate of South Africa - speaking in English: I accept.The PRESIDENT - speaking in Italian:I call upon the Delegate of India to speak.The Delegate of India - speaking in English: I accept, with the reservations indicated by Mr. Lloyd George.The PRESIDENT - speaking in Italian:In the name of the Italian Delegation, I wish to make ! the following declaration:&quot; The Italian Delegation declares that the Italian Qov-ernment accepts the Resolutions submitted by M. Schanzer, and undertakes, in the name of the Government of Italy, the pledges mentioned under Article VI of the said Rcsolu-tions &quot;.I call upon Baron. Hayashi, Delegate of Japan, to speak.Baron HAYASHI (Japan) - speaking in English: The Japanese Delegation, in the name of the Japanese Government, is happy to accept.The PRESIDENT - speaking in Italian:I call upon M. Schanzer, Delegate of Italy, to speak.M. SCHANZER r (Italy) - speaking in French: The following letter has been received from the Japan-ese Delegation :&quot; Mr. President, in the course of the discussions of &quot; the Sub-Commission, the Japanese Delegation felt compel-&quot; led to make a reservation with regard to the words
503- and the other Allied Governments - in paragraph 1 of Article VI (non-aggression). Since then, the Japanese Dele-gation has reconsidered the question in the light of the instructions received from its Government. It notes the explicit statement made by the President of the Sub-Com-mission, that the arrangement in question does not affect in any way the position of Japanese troops at present in Siberia. It considers that not only does the pact of non-agrcssion referred to above place no obstacle in the way of a preliminary agreement of the same kind, but also that the repetition of similar agreements may result in strengthening mutual confidence, and consequently in contributing to the establishment of peace.&quot; In a spirit of conciliation, realising the great irrippr-tance of reaching an unanimous agreement concerning the work of the Conference, the Japanese Delegation is glad to be able to state now that it can give its full assent on the point in question, it being clearly understood that the Presidents statement mentioned above is consi-dered as being taken for granted ,,.(Signed) Hayashi K.

SCHANZER (Italy) - speaking in French:The President of the Council of the League of Nations has duly sent a telegram to the President of the Conference asking him to submit to the Conference the resolutions adopted at the Warsaw Health Conference. Poland, in lief capacity as an Inviting Power at the Health Conference, has also sent a note to the same effect to the Presiden of the Sub-Commission of the First Commission.We submitted the note from Poland and the telegram from the President of the Council of the League of Nations
5046 a meeting of the Inviting Powers, who agreed to submit to the Conference the following Draft Resolution:&quot; The Conference approves the principle of the anti-epidemic campaign for European hygienic relief adopted at the Warsaw Conference, and recommends the European Governments represented at Genoa to discuss their appli-cation immediately, and for this purpose to appeal to their respective Parliaments for the necessary funds &quot;.It is certainly not the duty of the present Conference to make a further examination in detail of the results of a technical investigation carried out carefully with the assis-tancc of the experts of all the States concerned. But this Conference, by accepting the recommendations of the Warsaw Conference, will prove that, in spite of the cliffi-ctiities which arise from political questions, and from the ine-vitable divergences of opinion in discussing a solution of the various questions, it is unanimous not only in the desire to bring about the economic reconstruction of Europe, but also in the wish to apply by common agreement all the technical measures which constitute the essential conditions of and the first steps towards that reconstruction.The PRESIDENT - speaking in Italian:I call upon M. Tchitcherin, Delegate of Russia, to speak:M. TCHITCHERIN (Russia) - speaking in French:The Russian Delegation stands by the amendment on Epidemics moved in the Conference by the Russo-Ukrainiaii Delegation, which objected  to  the  scheme proposing to ntrust one of the organisms  of the League of Nations nitli the  task of   carrying out   these  resolutions. The usso-Ukrainian  Delegation asked  that, instead   of the eague of Nations, an international commission should be et up for the purpose of carrying out these resolutions, s you know, Russia has not recognised the League of ations, and we think that a body on which Russia would ot be represented could not usefully undertake this work. &apos;e beg, therefore, to move again the amendment which e have already moved, that a special commission, and not e League of Nations, be entrusted with the task of car-ing out these resolutions.The PRESIDENT - speaking in Italian:The remarks of the  Russian  Delegation  have been ted, and will be recorded in the Minutes. As there are other objections, the motion, as proposed by M. Schanzer, considered as adopted. I call upon M. Schanzer, Delegate of Italy, to speak.M. SCHANZER (Italy) - speaking in French: The Joint Commission of the International Committee the Red Cross and of the League of Red Cross society-s, and the President of the Italian Red Cross, have sent the President of the Genoa Conference a Note contain-the proposals adopted during the Plenary Meeting of Tenth International Red  Cross Conference at Geneva, a Resolution which they recommend for adoption by Genoa Conference. These documents were distributed all the Delegations on May 15, and were  submittedto a meeting of the Inviting Powers on the same day. The Inviting Powers, have decided to submit the following Draft Resolution for the approval of the Conference:&quot; The Genoa Conference resolves to refer to the League of Nations the Memorandum which the Mixed Coin-mission of the International Committee of the Red Cross and of the League of Red Cross Societies and the Presi-dent of the Italian Red Cross submitted to him on May 4, 1922 &quot;.The PRESIDENT - speaking in Italian:I call upon M. T^HITCHERIN Delegate of Russia, to speak.M. TCHITCHERIN - (Russia) speaking in French:The Russian Delegation heartily supports the proposal to complete the activity of the Red Cross by giving it func-tions such as the preservation of international health and the relief of distressed peoples. Russia recognises the very high value of the humanitarian work undertaken by the Red Cross, and the immense services rendered to the nations in time of war. By broadening its activity, the Conference would make it easier for the Red Cross to render to peoples in distress, in new fields of its activity, the same services as it has been able to render in time of war. Therefore the Russian Delegation supports the amendment, but opposes the reference to the League of Nations, which is not rccog-nised by the Russian Government.The PRESIDENT - speaking in Italian:The Minutes will take note of the objection made by j the Russian Delegation to referring the question of the Red Cross to the League of Nations.If no one else wishes to speak on the subject, the I motion will be considered as adopted.** *The motion was adopted. ** *The PRESIDENT - speaking in Italian:I call upon Mr. Lloyd George, Delegate of the British Empire, to speak.Mr. LLOYD GEORGE (British Empire) speaking in English:Mr. President, we have now come to the end of one of the most remarkable Conferences ever held in the history of the world. The Genoa Conference will be for ever an inspiring landmark on the pathway- of peace. Before we separate, I feel that it is a pleasure and a privilege to us who have come here from other lands, to adopt a resolu-tion of thanks, first of all to our President, for the tact and good-humour with which he has presided over our dis-cussions; to M. Schanzer, for the very arduous and anxious labours which he has undertaken on our behalf, and, if I may say so, especially for the skill and tact with which he has piloted us through the shoals and rocks and reefs of the
  i8 -First Commission. We also owe a debt of gratitude to the people of Italy, for a measure of hospitality which is worthy of a great and generous people. Never has Conference been better received. We owe also a debt to the city of Genoa for a reception which is worthy of a great and renowned city. Italy, in a desire to extend hospitality to us, has shown us every cpecimen of weather which she can command. We have had, of course, as you would naturally expect in Italy, sunny skies. But we have also had some of the angry and cold tramontana; we have had the gloomy and depressing sirocco; we have had some thunderstorms; but it has all ended to-day in blue skies. That is the history of the Con-ference.But you need all kinds of weather to make a good harvest, and if you look at what has been accomplished at Genoa, you will find that we have reaped and garnered fine crops. There is the great pact of peace; there are the reports and recommendations of the Commission on Finance, the Economic Commission, and the Transport Commission, all full of valuable recommendations, which, if they are adopted and pursued, will help to restore prosperity and vigour to the depleted veins of Europe.The Conference would have justified its existence if it had only been for the work accomplished by these three Commissions. It is true that their task has been overshadowed by more controversial issues. That is what always happens when any great controversial subject is under discussion. But those of us who are acquainted with the tasks of legislation know too well that controversial legislation is not always the most fruitful, and that is equally true perhaps of the tasks of this Conference. There is a real danger that, owing to the concentration of the thoughts of the Conference, and of the minds of people, upon the more debatable and dialectical part of our work, the quieter work, which is so vital to the interests of our peoples, might be overlooked. The recommendations of the Commissions contain matters of the deepest moment for the restoration of the economic vitality of Europe, and I sincerely trust that the mere printing and circulation of these reports will not be the end of them. If it is, they will simply add to the paper currency of which the world has already had too much. They have to be converted into gold by the alchemy .6f action, and we shall each of us, when we go home, bring them to the notice of those who are responsible for directing the affairs of our respective countries, and by that means help to restore healthier economic conditions in Europe.But still, I will not say the interest, but the real excitement of the Conference, has centred in another issue, in the question of the relations of Russia with the outside world, and of the assistance which the outside world is prepared to render in order to restore that devastated country, and to rescue its population from conditions which, in many cases, are conditions of deep mi-sery and distress. It is a problem full of danger and diffi-culty, and if I dwell a little upon it, I do so because we propose to continue our examination in another month&apos;s time in another form. It is surrounded by a jungle of pre-judices, swarming with very wild passions, and therefore dangerous to approach. Let me say this about the Confer-ence, and the way in which it debated that question. The cMscussions in themselves have demonstrated the value of International Conferences. Here is a question which has created many political crises in different countries, which has provoked wars and revolutions in two continents, debated in the Con-ierence in an atmosphere of calm and courteous investiga-tion. What better justification could you have for conferences than that? And all you have got to do, in order to know how valuable conferences are, is to consider the contrast between the tone of our deliberations and the tone of some of the comments upon those deliberations. You might have imagined from some of them that we have come here, no&apos;: to promote a general peace, but to organise a general Armageddon, and, if our discussions had been conducted in that spirit most of us would have passed from the Palazzo Reale to the Campo Santo.But our discussions were carried on in an atmosphere calm and quiet. What progress have we made towards the solution of this problem? Considerable progress. For the first time, Europe has faced that difficulty and not shirked it. Half your difficulties vanish the moment you face them and the other half disappear if you continue to face them That is what we have decided to do. We have decided to continue the examination of this problem, in order to struggle through, and that is the most courageous decision taken by this Conference. With a full knowledge of the magnitude, the complexity, and the perils surrounding the problem, we have decided deliberately to do our best to struggle through. That is a decision worthy of a great Con ference of nations. We have not gone as far as the most sanguine of us expected, but we have gone further than doubters ever hoped or wished to go. There is no goal worth reaching which is as near as it appears to the hope ful, or as remote as it seems to the timid, and that equally true of this object. The discussions are to be resum ed in a different place, under different conditions, in different manner, and, I hope, with a different result. We have a month for reflection on the difficulties revealed in this Conference,  before we resume those  discussions, sincerely hope that that month will be utilised with a view to discovering and suggesting solutions for these difficultiesI should like to say one word in that respect upon the Russian Memorandum of May 11. We are making no reply to it, but we cannot allow it to pass without one sentence. I do so, not in order to prolong the controversy because the last thing I wish to do is to end these proceed ings on a controversial note   but, as one who has taken a very leading part in endeavouring to secure better rela tions between the East and the West of Europe, I should like to utter one word of warning. I do not know what the effect of that Memorandum was in Russia,, but I know that the effect outside Russia was disastrous. It produced a reaction against the spirit of settlement, and, if it were the last word to be uttered by the Russian Government I should really despair of accomplishing much at the Hague I am referring to the Memorandum of May 11. Russia needs help. Europe and the world needs the produce which Russia can contribute. Russia needs the accumulated wealth and skill which the world can place at its command, to restore it. Russia cannot recover for a  generation without thai
505- 1.9 -help. Europe is more and more filling up the gap left by Russia. Russia needs more and more the help which the world can give, and the world is anxious to give it. Either from pride or from prudence, we have not, in any of these discussions, referred to the fact that, even at this moment, there are millions in Russia standing on the brink of famine and pestilence, who may perish without help. If Russia needs help she can get it. But will the Russian Delegation allow me, in a friendly spirit, to say one word? If Russia is to get help, Russia must not outrage the sentiments   if they like, let them call them the prejudices   of the world.There is a real sympathy for Russia&apos;s condition. But what are these prejudices? I will just name one or two, because they were all trampled upon in the Memorandum of May 11. The first prejudice we have in Western Europe is this, that if you sell goods to a man you expect to get paid for them. The second is this, that if you lend money to a man and he promises to repay you, you expect that he will repay you. The third is this. You go to a man who has already lent you money, and say * Will you lend me more ? * He says to you ? k Do you pro-pose to repay me what I gave you? * And you say * No, it is a matter of principle with me not to repay *.. There is a most extraordinary prejudice in the western mind against lending any more money in that way. It is not a question of principle. I know the revolutionary temper very well, and the revolutionary temper never acknowledges that any body has got principles, unless he is a revolutionary. But these prejudices are very deeply rooted; they are rooted in the soil of the world; they are inherited from the ages; you cannot tear them out. And if you are writing a letter asking for more credits, I can give one word of advice to anybody who does that. Let him not, In that letter, enter into an eloquent exposition of the doctrine of repudiation of debts. It does not help you to get credits. It may be sound, very sound, but it is not diplomatic.Now, I have only one or two more words to say. Eur-ope is anxious to help Europe can help, Europe will help. But Russia must, in her dealings with us, accept the code of honour which is an inheritance, which has come to us from centuries, from generations of hard-working and honest people. It has struck deep into the soil of the world, and and not even the Russian tornado has split one fibre of a single root of those prejudices, upon which our system de-pends. I do implore you, as a friend of Russian peace, as a friend of co-operation with Russia, as one who is in fa-vour of going to the rescue of those great and gallant and brave people, I implore the Russian Delegation, when they go to the Hague, not to go out of their way to trample upon those sentiments and principles which are deeply rooted in the very life of Europe.At Cannes, we threw out the life-line. We have not yet drawn it in, as I thought we might; neither has it been snapped; neither has it been let go. It is still there, and we would like to draw all the distressed, all the hungry, all the suffering in the East of Europe back to life, with all the help that the accumulated energy and skill of other lands can give.We have signed a pact of peace. It is a provisionalone. It is for months   no, it is for more than that. We have decided to have peace amongst warring nations. Once you establish it, nations are not going back upon it., We have decided to give peace a trial on our hearthstones, and when she has been there for seven months, we will not turn her out again. The psychological effects upon the peoples of the world will be electrical. The thrill of peace has gone through the veins of Europe, and you are not going to get nation lifting up hand against nation again.;There has been nothing more striking in this Confer-ence than the deep, passionate desire not to have a rupture, not to have a quarrel, but to live in peace and amity together. Believe me, peace is recovering her gentle sway over the hearts of men, and in this Conference, by this pact which we have adopted to-day, we have paid homage to her sceptre.The PRESIDENT - speaking in Italian:I call upon M. Barthou, Delegate of France, to speak.M. BARTHOU (France) - speaking in French:Gentlemen, the voice of France has already been heard in this debate with a clearness and sincerity which has been acknowledged by you all. I should not rise, to echo these words if it were not my duty to associate myself with the thanks, wishes and hopes which Mr. Lloyd George has so eloquently voiced. This duty is not inspired by a mere feeling of courtesy or diplomacy. 1 feel its neces-sity deeply. On behalf of the French Delegation, I must offer a most cordial and hearty tribute of gratitude to the Italian Government. To Italy, that great and noble country, I tender my thanks. May i be allowed to say that, since the days of my youth, I have had for Italy a profound sympathy and friendship, which has never failed for one hour, and it has therefore been for me a great pride and pleasure that my sentiments are in accord with the attitude adopted by my country. We have all experienced once more the generosity of Italy. Here at Genoa, we have been so well received and cared for that, during six weeks, we have been able to walk abroad in the streets of this living, swarming and crowded city without having heard one single word, without seeing one single gesture that might seem lacking in courtesy and good-will. Our thanks are offered to Genoa and to the Italian Government, whose task has been so difficult and has been accomplished with such success. Thanks also are due to the Italian Council for the liberality with which they have carried out their task. We also thank the Minister for Foreign Affairs who, in the course of our negotiations, has repeatedly proved his tact, skill and pru-dence, in bringing the proceedings to&quot; a successful con-clusion.Afer six weeks of hard work, there seems to be some boldness in writing down on the Agenda the words a Closing Speeches *, whereas the fear might have been felt that k rupturing speeches &quot; were more probable.You have not heard one single speech of rupture, and you will not hear one. Thirty-four States answered the invitation sent from Cannes on April 10. Thirty-four States attended the opening of this Conference, and thirty-four States are still present. Great progress has been rea-
lised. Mr. Lloyd George correctly described the tone of our deliberations; he rightly praised the pact of non-aggres-sion. Since we knew that pact was to be discussed, we carefully refrained from using any words of an aggressive character as regards our neighbours. We have succeeded. The Commissions have reached satisfactory conclusions. As Mr. Lloyd George said, the pact would be nothing if it were only words on paper, if the Governments had not the deliberate intention of carrying it out. At this point, may I express the absolute and loyal intention of the French Government to put these resolutions into practice, and to make of them an actual reality. Mr. Lloyd George mentioned the arduous and difficult nature of the question of relations with Russia, which the Conference has had to tackle. I am in rather a more difficult position than Mr. Lloyd George. I took part in unofficial conversations of a protracted nature with the Russian Delegation, in order to prove the earnest desire of my Government to collaborate in solving the pro-blem. In spite of that, however, I have been burnt in effigy at Petrograd. Luckily, it was only my effigy which was burnt. In spite of this gesture, which was rather too sym-bolical, I am not going to say one word which might seem to be hostile to the Russian Delegation. The only thing that matters is that there is a nation yonder which is suffering, and it is our duty to rush to her help. Humanity would never have made a single step forward if people had always asked &quot; What is your Government? What is your religion? What is your social  system ? &quot; before giving assistance. When men are suffering, it is the duty of the rest of man-kind to go to their help. The French Government cannot forget the immense services rendered by Russia during the first three years of the war. The Russian nation must know that we remain faithful to this pact of gratitude, and that we shall do everything in our power to alleviate their suf-ferings. You have heard a great statesman   and a great orator speak of landmarks on the road to peace. This means that we are still on the way, going together towards our common goal. There are other stages,  other landmarks, still  to come. The question is now whether  we shall all  march  together,  animated by the same feelings, and inspired by the same idea of solidarity and fellowship. I have listened to what M. Rathenau, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Germany, has said. I will not dispute the   sincerity  of his remarks;   I will  only say that I appreciate their finesse and prudence. He spoke of demo-bilising public opinion. I suppose he was referring to the warlike spirit. Well, let him be of good cheer; I can once more bring him a word from France. France, which did not want the late war, is ardently and passionately attached to peace, and to that peace we are all tending with the same heartfelt desire. The health of Europe has been seriously compromised and its balance upset, and that can only be restored if we are all inspired by a spirit of loyalty and solidarity, and if we show the same respect for order, honour and our pledged word. Is it still permissible to ask whether we wish for peace ? Of course we do. We are among those men of goodwill who wish for peace - &quot; et in terra pax hominibus bonae voluntatis &quot;. We are all men of good will, and together we shall succeed in imposing peace on Europe and on the world.The PRESIDENT - speaking in Italian :I call upon M. Banffy, Delegate of Hungary, to speak.M. BANFFV (Hungary) - speaking in French ;In the name of the Hungarian Delegation, I wish to thank the nations here assembled for the interest they have shown in the great questions of justice and equality which concern my nation so closely, and I wish to thank the Italian Government for the cordial way in which they have received our Delegation.The PRESIDENT - speaking in Italian ;I call upon M. Stambulisky, Delegate of Bulgaria, to speak.M. STAMBULISKY (Bulgaria) - speaking in Bulgarian: In the name of my country, a country that has greatly suffered, I wish to thank the promoters of the Genoa Con-ference, and to say that by this act they have accomplished a great deed, that will render their names immortal - the most noble deed that could have been effected for the nations that have suffered so much from the war. In spite of criticisms, I may say the Genoa Conference has reached deeply humane results; it has carried the patient from the battlefields to the bright galleries of peace; it has discovered the illness from which he was suffering; it has written the recipe that will cure him, and has found the means of applying it. On th&apos;s point, the Conference evidently encounter-ters difficulties, which do not arise from a lack of goodwill but from the fact that some of the necessary drugs are not to be found at Europe&apos;s chemists. To obtain assistance, we appeal to the powerful nation overseas, America. We shall find a great quantity of drugs for the use of Europe at the American chemists. The Bulgarians have a proverb which says &quot; Help yourself first, and then you will be helped &quot;. Europe must therefore help herself first, and America will help her afterwards. America will and must come to our assistance. She is a country of humanitarians and philanthro-pists. She once listened to the voice of the victorious nations and took part in the war to hasten its end. Now she will listen to the voice of those who were not on the winning side, those who suffered, and she will return and hasten the work of peace. The Genoa Conference has realised what was necessary and possible; we have to leave the rest to time. We must know how to wait. War; peace and all the rest must pass through the process of time. The principle of the peace of the world has been established; it will now develop and give good results.We, representing one of of the most sorely tried na-tions, are satisfied that the Genoa Conference has done much good. Bulgaria thanks the Conferences When an un-happy people are satisfied, they who constitute the majority of the world, it is a proof that what has been done here is of world-wide importance. Once again I wish to express the gratitude of Bulgaria to the promoters of the Conference. I would also like to thank Italy for her splendid hospitality; She has appeased the nervous system of all the Govern-ments; the people and the Government of Italy have done everything to&apos; lighten our task. They have won our hearts,
506and wc shall leave Genoa strengthened and brightened by the hope of peace, gladdened by the hospitality of Italy.The PRESIDENT - speaking in Italian :I call upon Baron Hayashi, Delegate of Japan, to speak.Baron HAYASHI (Japan) - speaking in English:I fully and most heartily associate myself with previous speakers in thanking the Italian Government, its Delegates, and the city of Genoa itself. Several centuries have passed since Genoa&apos;s great son, Columbus, went out to find the East. Now the East is here to pay its tribute.A word about the Conference. To borrow the expression of Mr. Lloyd George, we have had a certain amount of snarling, but much good work has been done. If I may be allowed to say so, that has been largely owing to the moderate and wisG attitude of our Russian friends. Their attitude has been much more moderate than I expected. I hope that at the next Conference, at The Hague, they will assume an even wiser and more prudent attitude. It is only such an attitude which, to my mind, will be helpful, and which will bring help from other countries in Europe, and in fu-ture days - perhaps in the near future - from America.The PRESIDENT - speaking in Italian:I call upon M. Tchitcherin, Delegate of Russia, to speak.M. TCHirCHERIN (Russia) - speaking in French;Whilst fully endorsing the vote of thanks to the Italian people and Government, and to the City of Genoa, and whilst recognising the entire goodwill of many of the na-tions. taking part in the Conference, the Russian Delegation feels obliged, at this stage of our work, to submit a few general considerations on the results of the Conference.The Russian Delegation was justified in its assertion, made at the beginning of the Conference, that the sole fact of convening all the European countries, without distinction of victor or vanquished, and without discrimination between opposing systems of property, was a memorable event, which was destined to be a source of real advantage to the establishment of universal peace, and to the economic reconstruction of Europe.It cannot, however, be denied that the results of the Conference do not fulfil the great expectations which it aroused amongst the peoples of all nations. What the Rus-sian Delegation desired, and what has been unfortunately lacking at the Genoa Conference, was a bold step towards new political and economic methods, a work of creation and construction, the establishment of new systems. At the open-ing meeting of the Conference, the Russian Delegation sketched out a system which, in its opinion, would have opened a new road to Europe, and made general European reconstruction possible. We have been prevented from sub-mitting to the Conference the question of disarmament, as well as certain other questions. These factors of a single system were, however, intimately bound up with the crea-Sve and constructive measures which we proposed. Having once refused to adopt this attitude, the Conference has not been able to add anything to existing facts, or to theereso-resolutions adopted by previous conferences, except to a small and insufficient extent. It has been unable to maintain the level of the principles set forth in the speeches at the first meeting, which proclaimed that there was no distinc-tion between victors and vanquished, and that sovietists and capitalists were upon an equal footing. These, in our opinion, are the causes of the unsatisfactory results of the Conference.We hope that this experience will bear fruit. The questions which are usually included in the expression * Russian problem * can only be satisfactorily solved if all concerned will consider them from our point of view of the equality of rights of the countries which have two dif-ferent systems of property, a point of view which is, as a matter of fact, that of the first resolution of Cannes ; we are anxious that this principle should be adopted by all who take part in the discussions at the Hague, for the brilliant exposition of the opposite theory, given by the Prime Minister of Great Britain, who has unexpectedly raised the question upon which we are divided, will not succeed in converting the Russian people to his ideas, any more than the invading White Armies succeeded in doing so. The British Premier tells me that, if my neighbour has lent me money, I must pay him back. Well, I agree, in thatpar-ticular case, in a desire for conciliation; but I must add that if this neighbour has broken into my house, killed my chil-dren, destroyed my furniture and. burnt my house, he must at least begin by restoring to me what he has des-troyed.We went still further. We should have been satisfied if we had received sufficient assistance to enable us to carry out what was imposed upon us. But the other side did not take the same view. However, we continue our efforts for conciliation. The Russian people is profoundly desirous of peace and collaboration with other nations, but, I need hardly add, on a basis of complete equality.If we are still hopeful with regard to the prospects of general peace, it is due in a large measure to the expres-instructions of deep and warm sympathy which we, as well as the other Delegations, have received from the whole of Italian society, and from the great masses of the Italian people. The spontaneity and the warmth of the marks of sympathy which the Russian Delegation has received in Italy are to us the most reassuring sign that, in the midst of all the antagonisms and all the complications of to-day, the vast majority are earnestly aspiring to general peace. The Genoa Conference will be a milestone of the greatest significance along the road to peace.The PRESIDENT - speaking in Italian:I call upon M. Bratianu, Delegate of Roumania, to speak.M. BRATIANU- (Roumania) - speaking in French:On behalf of the Roumanian Government, the Czecho-slovak Government, and the Government of the Serb-Croat-Slovene Kingdom, I am happy to add my thanks to those of the countries which have already expressed their gratitude to the Inviting Powers, the offices of the Conference, the President of the Conference, and the Presidents of the Commissions, for the work of peace carried out, and the agreement obtained at Genoa. We have been proud to col-
laborate in this work, and we congratulate ourselves upon the work which has been done in the cause of world peace.The PRESIDENT - speaking in Italian:We have reached the end of our labours, and I have the honour of extending the farewell salutation of Italy to the Delegates gathered here.It may be well to look back over the course we have travelled, and to take stock of the work accomplished by the Conference. But before doing this, allow me to express the great satisfaction we have felt at the words of friend-ship and esteem for our country which have been, pronounc-ed here. The Italian people will certainly welcome with gratitude and delight the demonstrations of sympathy and goodwill of this Assembly, which includes the most distin-distinguished statesmen and diplomatists.Permit me also to say, Gentlemen, that your thanks are due not so much to the Italian Delegation as to the Italian people. The spirit which has prevailed here has been the spirit of the Italian people, of which spirit we Dele-gates have been only the modest interpreters, a spirit of liberty, of democracy, and of wide tolerance for all ideas and all opinions. This tolerance was necessary to produce the right atmosphere for an assembly which was charged with the task of discussing the most weighty political pro-problems, and in which opposing tendencies were bound to come into sharp collision.At a previous plenary sitting, we approved the con-clusions of the Financial Commission and the Transport Commission. To-day, you have given the sanction of your votes to the proposals of the Economic Commission, which has submitted to you a series of resolutions of undoubted importance.If we consider as a whole the labours of the technical Commissions, we cannot fail to recognise the remarkable value of the results obtained by the Conference in a short space of time. Many questions of principle in the economic and financial sphere have been dealt with and solved, and important lines of action have been traced for the financial reform of the nations of Europe, and for facilitating the resumption of trade and of economic relations between them.Nevertheless, to speak frankly, all these theoretical con-clusions would remain merely general affirmations, if certain fundamental problems of European life were not first solved, and if the general conditions for the return of the econo-mic organism of Europe to a more regular functioning were not first created.We have applied ourselves with the greatest earnestness to the solution of one of these fundamental problems, the return of Russia to its place in the economic life of Europe, but the time assigned for the labours of the Conference has been too short to arrive at a definitive solution of the problem. This is not to say that the Conference has failed in its task, or that our work has been barren or useless. Far from it. We have clearly and definitely stated the terms of the problem, and we have discussed its fundamental aspects. We have found certain points of agreement between our ideas and those of the representatives of Russia, and have defined the points of disagreement which still divide us.It is true that the fact that the participation in the Conference of many &quot;responsible statesmen of various coun-tries would not allow of the indefinite prolongation of our labours, has prevented us from reaching a final agreement. But, most important of all, we have not lost confidence in the ultimate success of our efforts; we have decided to continue the negotiations which have been in progress here for some weeks, until a complete and satisfactory solution is obtained.The work to be accomplished at the Hague will be only the continuation, the offspring of the effort accomplished here in Genoa. If the labours of the Commissions at the Hague succeed, as we are fully confident that they will, in overcoming the difficulties which still remain, the merit of the final result must be ascribed to Genoa. It will be Genoa that will have opened the way to European re-construction.This fact is for us a reason for gratification and pro-found satisfaction. Genoa, though it may not have succeeded in accomplishing all that we had hoped and desired, has opened the way to a new European policy.This new European policy was affirmed in the very constitution of the Conference, with the concurrence of all the States which yesterday were still profoundly di-vided by the memories of the war. It has been&apos; a source of pride to Italy to have worked energetically and loyally day after day, for the maintenance of the original character of the Conference. We believe that, in spite of serious dif-difficulties, we have succeeded in our purpose; that we have in fact tempered inevitable antagonisms in an atmosphere of mutual toleration, and have contributed to a not incon-siderable advance in the work of European pacification.A long road is still to be travelled, but we believe that, apart from the immediate tangible results obtained at Genoa, the spiritual and political work of the Conference will find its inevitable continuation in the future develop-ments of international life. The character of universality and European pacification which we have earnestly desired for the Genoa Conference, must be the character of the Euro-pean policy of tomorrow. In the pact of non-aggression, though -it be only provisional and temporary, a word of peace has gone forth from Genoa, a word of peace which is a symbol, which expresses the most ardent aspiration of of our hearts, and which will not be unheard by the peoples of Europe.On behalf of the King, Government and people of Italy, I bid a hearty farewell to all the Delegations present, thank-ing them for their unwearied efforts and for the valuable work they have accomplished, and express the most cordial wishes for the prosperous future of all the nations as-sembled here.** *The meeting terminated at I p. w,
