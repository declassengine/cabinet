CONFIDENTIAL. Copy No.CP. 133 (27).SANCTIONS.THE worst affront and injury we have received in China was at Hankow, when we were hustled out of our Concession and forced to surrender our Treaty rights under an agreement which has never been kept. To retrieve this position must remain for us a most important objective. Let us have fruitful &quot; sanctions &quot; not barren &quot; sanctions.&quot; To lire off Naval cannon at obsolete Chinese forts, or worthless Chinese arsenals or ludicrous Chinese warships cannot lead to any lasting advantage. Punishing China is like flogging a jellyfish. We should use the powerful forces we have now assembled in China, not for the sterile satisfactions of revenge, but to recover and defend our lawful rights. We should fire at the Chinese, not to punish them for what they have done in the past, but to prevent them from depriving us of our rights in the future and to regain those out of which we have been thrust. I am therefore in the fullest agreement with the Foreign Secretary&apos;s note of the 17th April, that Hankow is of all others the point where we should act.There we find the Japanese with a handful of marines and sailors, backed by their ships, resolutely and successfully defending their Concession. With their incomparable knowledge of China they did not seem, even under the late pacific Government, to be particularly anxious about their local position. Ought we not to denounce the violated Hankow agreement, reoccupy our Concession at Hankow and place ourselves at their side ? When they quit, we may quit. But what is good enough for them ought surely to be good enough for us.Moreover, by acting at Hankow we do not do anything to alienate or weaken Chiang Kai-shek in his new7 anti-Bolshevik mood. For whatever it is worth we let this favourable development take its natural course. We strike only at our old and his new enemies. On every ground of policy Hankow is at this juncture the decisive point.The Chiefs-of-Staff Committee are no doubt right from the general military point of view in deprecating dispersions of our limited forces. 1604S
Nevertheless I am of opinion that they should be ashed to tell us in detail what forces would be necessary to enable us to retake our Conees-sion at Hankow and hold it for so long as the river is-still navigable for warships. The same question should also be put simultaneously to Admiral Tyrwhitt. As long as the river is navigable, 000 miles is hot more formidable than 100 or 200 miles, and not comparable in risk to taking up a position even 50 miles inland.W. S. C.April 25, 1927.
