IllEEJIS DOCUMENT 13 THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJiSSTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)3  1JLJL3!Copy No.3oC A B II N E TBJSPORg OF OHB OBOftH  BOO&amp;gpiNGS OCMMITTEE,memorandum  um by the Lor d C h a np811or,1.      I ciroulate herewith the Report of the Crovvn Proceedings Committee,2.      It will be seen from the Report that under the instructions given to the Committee by Lord Haldane, when Lord Chancellor,  their only duty was to prepare a Bill and not to report as to the expediency of the proposals contained in it.So      The only question now arising is whether the Report should be published,    It appears to me impossible to withhold publication..    Questions asked in the House of1 Commons have frequently pressed for the Report.    The fact that the Committee have reported will soon become common knowledge,   if it is not so already;    and copies of the Report are naturally in the hands of the members of it,  some of whom are warm advocates of  the changes embodied in the Bill.4.      The publication of the Report will not commit the Government to any course of aotion.    I should propose that, when time permits,  the Bill scheduled to the Report should be referred to a Committee of the Cabinet for the consi-deration of whet action,  if any,  should be taken upon it.(Initialled) C.Bouse of Lords,1st April, 1927.

inTo the Right Hon. the Viscount Cave,Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain.My Lord,1. We were appointed a Committee in 1921 by your Lordship&apos;s predecessor, the Earl of Birkenhead, to consider the position of the Crown as litigant and to propose such amendments of the law as we might consider advisable and feasible having due regard to the excep-tional position of the Crown, and to prepare a Bill embodying and giving effect to such changes as we might feel ourselves in a position to recommend.2. We now have the honour to present to your Lordship our Report. We have held 41 meetings (including meetings of the sub-committee), and, in addition to the witnesses mentioned in paragraph 9, Sir Charles Morton on behalf of the Law Society, and Mr. John Paxton representing the Liverpool Law Society, attended before us.3. The full terms of reference to the Committee were defined in a letter from your Lordship&apos;s Permanent Secretary to the then Attorney-General (Lord Hewart), dated 16th November, 1921. A copy of this letter is printed as Appendix I. to this Report.4. The chief matters which were left for us to con-sider as possible subjects of legislation involved the following propositions : (a) That the procedure by Information and Petition of Right should be abolished and the procedure in cases in which the Crown was a litigant should be assimilated, as far as possible, to the proce-dure regulating the conduct of cases between subjects, including such matters as discovery, the receiving and paying of costs by the Crown, and the like :o   (S2)27371   Wt 11771 13C8   25 25 25 25 50   4/i7   E&amp;S
(b) That the Crown, with certain reservations, shouldbe placed in the same position as a subject as regards the power and liability to sue and be sued in the County Courts :(c) That the Crown should become liable to be sued in tort.5. In accordance with the suggestion contained in the penultimate paragrajjh of the above-mentioned letter, a sub-committee was appointed to undertake preliminary work. This sub-committee consisted of Sir Claud Schuster (Chairman), Sir John Mellor, Sir George Barstow, Sir Thomas Willes Chitty, Mr. J. Eye, Mr. R. M. Greenwood, Mr. J. H. Shaw, Mr. M. L. Cwyer and Mr. W. M. (now Sir William) Graham Harrison, and in addition has had the assistance on many occasions of Mi\ Giveen.6. In 1924, however, before we were able to bring to a conclusion the necessarily prolonged enquiries and to complete the drafting of a Bill, the Lord Chancellor (Lord fialdane) modified the original terms of reference and requested us to prepare a Bill on the above lines on the assumption that the alterations in law involved therein were both desirable and feasible, and we were thus relieved of the duty of making any recommendation as to the desirability or feasibility of the proposals.7. We now submit to your Lordship as Appendix II. to this Report, a draft Bill, which has been prepared by us in accordance with Lord Haldane&apos;s request, that is, /upon the assumption set out in the last preceding paragraph.8. At two different stages in its preparation, the draft Bill was submitted by the sub-committee to the following Government Departments : .   H.M. Treasury, The Home Office, The Foreign Office, The Colonial Office, The War Office,
(b) Tliat the Crown, with certain reservations, shouldbe placed in the same position as a subject as regards the power and liability to sue and be sued in the County Courts:(c) That the Crown should become liable to be suedin tort.5. In accordance with the suggestion contained in the penultimate paragraph of the above-mentioned letter, a sub-committee was appointed to undertake preliminary work. This sub-committee consisted of Sir Claud Schuster (Chairman), Sir John Mellor, Sir George Barstow, Sir Thomas Willes Chitty, Mr. J. Rye, Mr. R. M. Greenwood, Mr. J. H. Shaw, Mr. M. L. Gwycf and Mr. W. M. (now Sir William) Graham Harrison, and in addition has had the assistance on many occasions of Mr. Giveen.6. In 1924, however, before we were able to bring to a conclusion the necessarily prolonged enquiries and to complete the drafting of a Bill, the Lord Chancellor (Lord Haldane) modified the original terms of reference and requested us to prepare a Bill on the above lines on the assumption that the alterations in law involved therein were both desirable and feasible, and we were thus relieved of the duty of making any recommendation as to the desnability or feasibility of the proposals.7. We now submit to your Lordship as Appendix II. to this Report, a draft Bill, which has been prepared by us in accordance with Lord Haldane&apos;s request, that is, /upon the assumption set out in the last preceding paragraph.8. At two different stages in its preparation, the draft Bill was submitted by the sub-committee to the following Government Departments : .   H.M. Treasury, The Home Office, The Foreign Office, The Colonial Office, The War Office,
The Admiralty,The Board of Trade,The Ministry of Health,The Board of Education,The Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries,The General Post Office,The Air Ministry,The Ministry of Labour,The Ministry of Transport,The Ministry of Pensions,The Board of Customs and Excise,The Board of Inland Revenue,The Charity Commissioners,The Registrar of Friendly Societies,The Public Trustee,H.M. Office of Works.9. Various criticisms and suggestions were made on those occasions by the several Departments, and in addition representatives of the following Departments, viz., The Treasury, the War Office, the Admiralty, the Board of Trade, the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries and the Post Office, attended before the sub-committee in order to state more fully certain objections and difficulties which they felt in connection with the draft.All the suggestions and criticisms made by the Departments were most carefully considered by the sub-committee, and we have reason to think that the Departments, assuming that the proposed changes are to be effected, would, subject to reservations with regard to one or two matters, consider as satisfactory the method of so doing which has been adopted in the draft Bill.10. We have to record with great regret the death in 1924 of our colleague, Sir Walter Trower, which deprived us in the later stages of our work of the assistance and criticism which he was particularly qualified to give as representing the general view of the solicitors of the country.B 2
11. In conclusion we desire to express our apprecia-tion of the valuable assistance which has been rendered by Mr. Ralph Sutton in connection with the drafting of the Bill and the preparation of memoranda on various points of law. We also wish to record our thanks to our Secretary, Miss Enid Rosser, for her assistance in our deliberations.We have the honour to be, My Lord, Your Lordship&apos;s obedient Servants,HEW ART, C.J.

APPENDIX I.Copy of Letter from the Lord Chancellor^ Permanent Secretary to the Attorney General.November 16th, 1921.I )oar Attorney General,The Lord Chancellor is glad to learn that the Solicitor General and yourself concur in his view that a change should be effected in the position of the Crown as a litigant, and that for that purpose legislation should bo introduced as soon as a Bill can conveniently be prepared.The main lines which would be followed in any such legislation Avould be as follows : 1. The Crown within certain reservations, would be placed in the same position as the subject as regards power to sue and liability to be sued in the County Court.2. The Crown would become liable to be sued intort.3. Tho Crown would have the same capacity to recover, and the same liability to pay, costs as the subject litigant.4. Subject to a limitation as to documents the disclosure of Avhich would be against the interests of the State, and as to oral evidence disclosing facts which would be against the interests of the State, a litigant against the CroAvn Avould have the same right of discovery as that which one subject has against another&apos; subject.5. In substance, the procedure by petition of right, English Information and Latin Information, would be abolished.The Lord Chancellor concurs with you in thinking that the result of these proposals would be equally aebvantageous to the CroAvn and to the subject in litigation AA&quot;ith the CroAAUi.So great a change, hoAArever, would require very careful consideration and many points of detail would arise, upon Avhich reservations and limitations would be required. Further the change would affect different Departments in different ways, and Avould render it
necessary in some cases to substitute an alternative machinery for that which was abandoned.The Lord Chancellor thinks that any such Bill as is contemplated could only be prepared under the super-vision of a body of persons experienced in the subject matter, who would have the opportunity of hearing and considering any representation which those principally affected by the change might desire to put forward.He proposes, therefore, that such a Committee should be established with yourself as Chairman and should comprise among its members certain members of the Judicial Bench, those counsel who usually act for the Crown in civil proceedings, the King&apos;s Remem-brancer, the Treasury Solicitor and those in charge of the office of the Treasury Solicitor (Law Courts Branch) upon the common law side and the equity side respectively, a representative of the Treasury, a representative of the office of the Parliamentary draftsmen, a representative of the Law Society, and a representative of his Lordship&apos;s office.While the Lord Chancellor thinks it necessary that any such Bill should be examined and approved by such a body as I have indicated, he realises that many of those whose presence upon the Committee he would consider essential, and in particular the Solicitor General and yourself, are too fully occupied with public affairs to be able to give continuous attention to so long and laborious a task. He, therefore, suggests that the preliminary work should be undertaken by a sub-committee of the Committee, which should consist of the Treasury Solicitor, his representatives at the Law Courts Branch, the King&apos;s Remembrancer and the representatives of the Treasury and the Parliamentary Counsel, together with myself as Chairman.Upon learning from you that these proposals have your concurrence, the Lord Chancellor will issue to those whose names I have indicated an invitation to serve upon the Committee, the terms of reference being sufficiently defined by this letter.Yours sincerely, (Signed)      CLAUD SCHUSTER.
