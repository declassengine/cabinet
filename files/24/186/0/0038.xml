Printed for the Cabinet.   April 1927.SECRET. Copy No.      30CP. 139 (27).CABINET.EXPORT OF AERONAUTICAL MATERIAL TO RUSSIA.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air. .1. I wish to take my colleagues&apos; advice as to the line which I should adopt in connection with four applications which have recently been received in the Air Ministry from aircraft manufacturing firms for the export of aeronautical material to Russia.2. In November 1924 (Cabinet 59 (24), Conclusion 10) the Cabinet decided that they would not sanction the equipment of Soviet Russia with arms and ammunition of British manufacture. This decision they re-endorsed in January 1925 (Cabinet 1 (25), Conclusion 9).In January 1926 (Cabinet 1 (26), Conclusion 5) this decision was modified to permit of the export of war material &quot;of a purely defensive character.&quot;3. Aircraft, however, owing to the fact that many types (more particularly those of older design) may be utilised for legitimate civil just as much as for military purposes, are not regarded as arms for the purpose of the Arms Export Prohibition Order of 1921 provided they carry no armament fittings, and no licence is required for their export.Accordingly, it is our present practice to scrutinise and deal with each application on its merits.4.   The applications now in question are as follows : (1.) A number (unspecified) of &quot; Horsley &quot; machines complete with engines and instruments.This machine is a modern type of bomber with which several bombing units of the Royal Air Force have recently been equipped.(2.) &quot; A large quantity of Napier engines &quot; the enquiry being from a German firm with a view to export to Russia.The Napier Lion engine is one of the principal types of engine in general use in the Royal Air Force to-day.(3.) One &quot; Yeovil &quot; bomber.This is a modern type of machine, but is not being adopted for use in the Royal Air Force.(4.) A number of crankshafts for &quot; Liberty &quot; engines.The Liberty engine is still standard in the Royal Air Force, though the machines in which it is employed are in process of being replaced bv more modern types.None of the above have reached the stage of &quot; firm &quot; orders; &apos; the manufacturers concerned have so far merely been asked to quote.5. I may add that there can be no doubt but that items (1) and (3) can only be required for military purposes, and practically, if not legally, should be classified as &quot; Arms,&quot; and there, is the strongest probability, amounting almost to certainty, that items (2) and (4) are also required for military machines.[16078]
6. Further, the question of exporting this material to Russia is particularly-complicated at the present time by the possibility of some portion of it finding its way into China.7. In these circumstances, I am inclined definitely to reject the applications in respect of items (1) and (2), though I do so with regret in so far as the British aircraft manufacturing industry is at present suffering from lack of orders and a con-siderable consequent degree of unemployment.As regards item (3), I am rather more doubtful, despite the fact that the &quot; Yeovil&quot; is definitely a military machine. One machine, even of modern type, is hardly likely to be intended for a Chinese destination, and is, in any case, not a serious proposition. Moreover, the firm concerned (The Westland Aircraft Works) is very badly placed for orders at the present time. Export may, however, be regarded as inconsistent with the Cabinet decisions above quoted.As regards item (4), the Liberty engine was, of course, originally an American design and there is no doubt that if the Soviet authorities are unable to obtain these crankshafts from a British source they will procure them elsewhere, e.g., the United States&quot;, without difficulty. In these circumstances and in view of the difficult position of the engineering industry in Sheffield at the present time (a Sheffield firm is concerned) I should propose to authorise the application.8. As pointed out in paragraph 2 above, on the assumption that none of the foregoing items comprise any armament fittings (a point which is not made clear in the applications as regards (1) and (3), and which does not arise in the case of items (2) and (4)), no licence from the Board of Trade is required for their export, and we can only rely on the goodwill of the firms concerned, the Official Secrets Act, despite its wide terms, being obviously inapplicable in cases such as the present, where all the machines and engines concerned are on the Air Ministry&apos;s &quot; Open List.&quot;Quite apart, however, from more general considerations, inasmuch as the firms which have applied in respect of (1) to (3) are almost entirely dependent for their existence on Government orders, it is safe to assume that export will not be made if our consent is withheld.S. H.Air Ministry, April 29, 1927.
