4 f i 113 .memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture &amp; fisheries.Billingsgate Market serves the whole of London and the home counties.    The need for better marketing facilities for fish in London is beyond dispute.   The objections to the division of the market in two and to the removal of part of it, or even the whole of it,  to a different site are, 1 think, well founded,    1 understand that the main objection to the proposed western extension of Billingsgate is that it would actually increase the present congestion in the streets rather than relieve it.    In these circumstances, I am anxious that ,the proposal of the City Corporation to acquire the Custom House site should not be rejected without&quot;, further examination.I am riven to understand that the present Custom House is incapable of housing the whole of the Customs staff, and that a considerable part of the staff is scattered in different buildings elsewhere.    If, as appears to be not improbable, it would be a convenience to the Custom House staff to be rehoused in a more adequate building on another site - which,  incidentally, would relieve them of the unpleasant proximity of the Pish Market - 1 ::.r, doubtful whether the merely sentimental objection to the demolition of the Custom Louse ought to stand in the way of Improvements which would be advantageous both to the Market and to the Customs staff.I understand that at their last approach to the 0: fice of works the Mmvets Committee asked for a firm offer of the Custom House site.   Irom various discussions which have taken place between officials of the 1-1 sherdesret. 124(2-7).Ocbinet.Copy No.      jjBILLINGSGATE MARKET.
1 Q1JL t/ &quot;atDepartment and the Committee, they gathered the impression that the Committee had been thinking In tei-ras of a sum of  750.000 for the purohase of the site out and out.. I Co not know what sum would he required adequately to rehouse the Custom staff on a new site nearby, but, assuming that that is in Itself a desirable objeot, I urn disposed to think that we ought to find out what is the best bargain that we could strike with the City Corporation.I?: it is considered sufficiently important, it might, be made a condition of any bargain that the river front of the Custom House should be preserved.   In any case, the Government might insist that the external architectural features of the new market building; should be subject to their approval.    I do not think they ough.t   to dismiss the proposal without further examination, simply, for the preservation of a building which, whatever its architectural beauties may be, can hardly be described as an ancient monument, and is, if I am rightly informed, inadequate for its purpose.(Intld..)
