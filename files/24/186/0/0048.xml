(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT. )Copy No. % IJ[?. No. 149(27.) . ECRET.CABINET.AGRICULTURE AND SAFEGUARDING 0? INDUSTRIES. Memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture.At the next meeting of the Council of Agriculture for England on May 27th Sir George Courthope, M.P. (Chairman of the House of Commons&apos; Conservative Agricultural Committee), has given notice to move the following resolution--&quot;This Council, while recognizing the value of recent agricultural legislation, is convinced that its effect upon the present economic position of agriculture Is insufficient to maintain food prodxiction and rural employment, and that further legislation of a far-reaching nature is urgently . required for this purpose.    In view of the increased production and employment which has been promoted in other industries by the Safeguarding of Industries Act and other protective measures, without increase of cost to the consumer of the articles produced, this Council urges His Majesty&apos;s Government to extend the operation of. this Act to agriculture, in order to maintain and increase the production of those classes of farm and garden produce which are moat seriously threatened by foreign competition.&quot;The Council of Agriculture is a statutory body meeting quarterly.     It includes representatives not only of each County Council but also of all other agricultural interests, and Ib regarded as the Parliament of Agriculture.
The particular method of protoction suggested by Sir George Cour-thope is unsuitable.    It would be difficult to show that any agricultural product is suffering from exceptional or unfair competition, or that employment in agriculture is seriously affected by foreign competition. As a matter of fact there is no unemployment among land workers.   Moreover safeguarding duties are only imposed for a limited period and temporary assistance of this kind in agriculture Is of little value v as plans for cropping have to be made a long way ahead.But apart from all these difficulties, there is the over-riding political objection against food taxes.   For this reason articles of food and drink have from the first been excluded from the Safeguarding of Industries Scheme, and for the same reason the Prime Minister gave a definite pledge at the last General Election on the subject.   It is, therefore, necessary that this demand for protoction of agriculture should be promptly dealt with.   Demands of this nature are apt to be Infectious.     There is no doubt that agriculture at the present time Is in lew water, and that protection would be welcomed by some farmers as a solution of their difficulties.     The agricultural labourer Is, however, still familiar with stories of the hungry forties, and owing to the number of women who have since been added to the electorate, a proposal to &quot;tax food&quot; might well cause an even greater political landslide In agricultural areas than It did in 1906.     We have made it clear in our YJhite Paper on Agricultural Policy that protection for agriculture is out of the question.     The headquarters of the National Farmers&apos; Union realise the position and have ceased to press protectionist proposals.     If, hov/ever, the Council of Agriculture for England; whose activities ars viewed by the National Farmers&apos; Union with a jealous eye, pass this
resolution, It lias been conveyed to mo that the headquarters of the National Farmers&apos; Union will find it difficult to resist the pressure from their branches to make a similar demand.     In circumstances of this kind an impression Is created that if only sufficient pressure is brought to bear on the Government, they will be compelled to give way. Other Unionist Members of Parliament representing agricultural constituencies will be tempted to take up the cry, and the position will be embarrassing for us.     I consider it essential, therefore, that this movement should be nipped in the bud, and that I should be in a position to say quite definitely to the Council of Agriculture that the Government are unable to depart from their existing policy in regard to protection for agriculture..    I should like to have the authority of my colleagues to make this pronouncement,??. G.MINISTRY OF AGRICULTURE AMD FISHERIES 12th May, 1927.
