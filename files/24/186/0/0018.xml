(mc DOCUMENT IS TEE PliOPERTi OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos; *secret. COP?. NO,._ &apos;119(27). CABINET.CUSTOM HOUSE AND BILLINGSGATE MARKET.Memorandum &quot;by the First Commissioner of Works.I desire to bring to the&apos;notice of ny colloagues, who may be approached individually in the matter,  the following circumstances relating to the London Custom House and Billingsgate Pish Market,The Kites of the Custom House and the Fish Market adjoin,  the flanks of the buildings being only a few feet apart and the Custom House lying to the East of the Market.      It appears to be generally admitted that the market facilities provided by the present Billingsgate buildings are altogether ina-dequate.      The fact that there is access from the road on one front only  (Lower Thames Street)  leads  to serious congestion of traffic every corning in all the adjacent streets.      Since 1906, at least,  the City Corporation, which controls the market, has been endeavouring to obtain more space and improved, access facilities.      Until recently the various schemes put forward have involved the use of the Custom House 0,,&apos;uay being obtained for fish carts and the building of additional jetties in front of the Custom House to provide increased facilities for unloading water-borne fish supplies.      The Board of Customs have consistently opposed all such schemes as being calculated, by bringing the fish and all that is associated with it much nearer to them,  to make the Custom House uninhabitable.      Three of my predecessors,   (as also Lord Oxford,   in 190*, when Chanceilo of the Exchequer) personally investigated the problem and agreed.
Miagreed to support the Board ox&apos; Customs and to refuse the facilities asked for by the Corporation.The Corporation have now raised the matter again with me and have suggested that the possibility should be considered of the Government handing over practically the whole of the site of the Custom House with a view to extending, the Market buildings and that the Corporation in return would rehouse the Customs headquarters staff on a suitable site in a suitable building.There are warehouses and wharves immediately to the westward of the market which, prima facie,  could be utilised for the desired extension of Billingsgate. The Corporation state that they have exhaustively considered, this possibility and cannot recommend it. They do not, however,  give the grounds for their view and I am not able to conjecture what decisive consideration against the proposal there ma:/ be.    Further, a Departmental Committee, set up by the Ministry of Food, to consider the wholesale food markets of London, reported in 1920,  by majority,   that the solution of the difficulties of the Billingsgate Market lay in utilising the buiidings there for water-borne fish supplies only and erecting a new market near the railway termini  (e. g. Kings Cross) to deal with the rail-borne supplies (stated by the Committee to amount to approximately 90$ of the whole) which are at present taken by road to Billingsgate and. are the cause of the traffic congestion there.     (Cmd.    1:168.  of 1921).      I understand,  however that the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries does not now favour this solution.In face of these considerations I  cannot regard the case  for the relief of Billingsgate as made out to the point of justifying the destruction of sowell-known
well-known and notable a feature of the Thanes-si^e as the Custom House..      I venture to think that the Government agreeing to the demolition of this building would lead to protests as great as were raised against the destruction of Waterloo Bridge.      The site of the Custom House, or its immediate neighbourhood,  has been occupied by a London Custom House for over 500 years. The present building was erected in 1817 from designs by Laing,  its three immediate predecessors having been destroyed by fire.I am accordingly informing the City Corporation that I cannot consent to any proposals that would involve the destruction of the Custom House and I  trust that I shall have the support of my colleagues in this attitude.P.8th April,. 1987.
