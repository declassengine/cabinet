Printed for the Cabinet.   April 1927.CONFIDENTIAL.CP. 114 (27).CABINET.THE   EGYPTIAN  ARMY.Memorandum to the Cabinet by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.IN 1914, the bulk of the Egyptian army (which then, of course, comprised Sudanese as well as Egyptian units) was stationed in the Sudan, the numbers in Egypt itself being : 3 Battalions.] Battery,I Company Garrison Artillery, and1 Cavalry Squadron.2. During, and after, the war the number of purely Egyptian units in the Sudan was gradually reduced. In 1924, the last Egyptian formations, and the remaining Egyptian personnel from other units, were finally ejected, while the Sudanese units were severed from the Egyptian army and became the Sudan Defence Force. The return of Egyptian units from the Sudan, a process which had been going on for some years, the raising of two new battalions and a cavalry squadron to absorb ejected personnel, together with the formation of a Royal bodyguard in 1922, bring the present figures for Egypt to the following :. 11 Battalions. 4 Batteries.2 Garrison Artillery Companies. 2 Squadrons.*3. In 1914, British officers commanded some of the Egyptian, as well as all the Sudanese, battalions. The higher command, and headquarter and departmental staffs were also British, On the murder of Sir Lee Stack, in November 1924, the Sirdarship devolved upon the next senior British officer in the Egyptian army. General Huddleston, however, was unable at that critical moment to leave Khartoum, or effectively to exercise command in Cairo, and shortly afterwards he severed his connection with the Egyptian army on assuming charge of the newly constituted Sudan Defence Force. But he had, in the meanwhile, delegated his powers, so far as Egypt was concerned, to the British Inspector-General in Cairo, General Spinks. The latter has since continued with marked skill and patience to discharge the functions of Acting Sirdar, but he has received no specific recognitipn as such by the Egyptian Government, and the difficulties of his task are increasing.4. Concurrently with the developments outlined above, two radical political changes took place in Egypt. In 1922, our Protectorate was withdrawn and Egypt was declared, subject to certain reserves, to be an independent sovereign State, and in the following year, an advanced democratic Constitution, on western lines, was substituted for a theoretically absolute autocracy. These changes have, of course, quite altered the position in respect of the army, and of all other branches of the administration and public services. In these circumstances, it is quite inevitable that the army, its size, command, armament, and so on, should receive a share of the political limelight which has been turned by the inexperienced Egyptian Parliament on all their public institutions. The army question has a great deal in common with others which face us in Egypt, and it can only properly be dealt with&apos; as part of our whole problem.   This is, in fact, the light in which it has been* For details, aud particulars of armament, see Cairo telegram No. 62.B921   [15972] B
regarded hitherto. Sir Lee Stack, who possessed a wide experience of Egypt and the Egyptians, followed a policy of strengthening direct British military control in the Sudan, while relaxing it in Egypt. At the time of bis death, this policy had largely been carried into effect. British regimental officers had already been with-drawn from units in Egypt in accordance with the broad policy of concentrating on advisory, as opposed to executive, posts, and on making Egyptians assume responsibility which His Majesty &apos;s Government has consistently followed since 1\st2, and to which, indeed, there is no feasible alternative which offers any prospect of permanent success.5. From paragraph 2 above it will be seen that the actual increases in the strength of the Egyptian army in Egypt (except in the special case of the Royal body-guard) have been the result of our action in clearing the, Egyptians from the Sudan. From the latest figures available to me, the present relative rifle strengths of the British garrison in Egypt and of the Egyptian army appear to be: *British,   10,622 [ 4- 2.360 in the Sudan], Egyptian, 9,993.6. Allowance, being made for the great difference in the quality of the troops, as well as the British superiority in artillery, and tanks and for a strong air force, our margin of security seems adequate at present. As to the immediate future, such measures as have already been adopted, and such speeches as have been delivered in the Egyptian Chamber, seem rather to indicate exaggerated conceit on the part of the more extreme nationalist element, and a desire to see how far they can safely assert themselves without our intervention, than any considered and consistent policy of military expansion. Egypt is emphatically an unmilitary nation. Her past record in this respect is inglorious. She produces no class with the, qualities required to make a good officer, while the peasantry hate and fear compulsory service. But &quot;we must not lose sight of the fact that the outstanding tendency among Egyptians at present is to try to rid themselves of our control so far as they dare do so without exposing themselves to retaliation on our part, or danger from other quarters for instance, from Italy.7. By deciding on some important increase in the strength of the army the Egyptian Chamber is in a position at any time to place us in an embarrassing position, and one possibly of real difficulty, if they were to turn their attention to securing or attempting to secure foreign instructors, armament or munitions. It need not be emphasised that we could permit nothing of this kind.8. The Egyptian Chamber, in the near future, may adopt resolutions on any of the following points, which, however, are not of a nature to cause us any immediate concern : (1.) An increase, in the establishment of certain battalions (involving a total ofsome 1,650, all ranks). (2.) A reduction in the period of military service from five years to three years. (3.) The purchase of twenty-two additional machine guns.   (This purchase hasalready been sanctioned by us, but the delivery of the guns has been suspended indefinitely.) (4.) The formation of a flying unit.Of these, Lord Lloyd considers, and I agree, that (1) and (2) are comparatively unobjectionable in themselves, while (3) and (4) could not become operative without our assistance. There are various other questions, notably that of a reorganisation of the Frontier Districts Administration, to which I do not attach great importance, and the settlement of which should be subordinated to that of the main problem.9. As &quot;will be seen from the foregoing paragraphs, the Cairo-telegrams which form part of the telegraphic correspondence annexed to this minute convey rather a misleading impression of the historical background and tend to overestimate the immediate dangers of the present position, but I find myself in entire agreement with Lord Lloyd in thinking that some decisive action on our part cannot longer be deferred. It is plain that we shall ha,ve to intervene, sooner or later, and the longer we wait the more difficult is our task likely to become. Various local political con-siderations, moreover, into which I need not enter here, lead me to think that the present juncture may be a more favourable one than is likely to recur for some time to come.* Vickers machine guns counted as twenty rifles, Lewis and Hotchkiss guns counted as ten rides.
10. -Assuming, therefore, that intervention on our part cannot longer be postponed, we must be ready to take drastic action to ensure acceptance of our demands. &apos; It is, of course, impossible to foresee precisely how far we should have to 0-o. but there seems reason to hope that we should be able to attain our object without undue difficulty, if we set about it in the right manner.11. The object, in short, is to ensure that the Egyptian army should not become a menace to our position, either by reason of any considerable increase in its strength, or of its deterioration, under political influences, into a weapon in the hands of our Nationalist opponents.12. Lord Lloyd&apos;s main suggestion to meet the problem is that the Egyptian Government should be induced to recognise General Spinks as Acting Sirdar. This recommends itself, at first sight, as a proposal which the Egyptians could readily be made to accept. There is, however, no certainty on this point. The Egyptian Government have latelv shown signs of increasing reluctance to meet our require-inents. The Sirdarship, the reversion of which for some time past they have regarded as a right, is probably a point on which Egyptian amour-projire is engaged. General Spinks&apos;s succession to the post (see paragraph 3), while logically defensible enough, is open to political attack as an inequitable fiction. It thus seems possible that the present Egyptian Government might prefer to resign rather than accept even this demand, and in face of the overwhelming Zaghlulist majority in Parliament no alternative Government might come forward, and we should be faced with a Constitutional crisis at the outset. But even if the Egyptian Government were to give way, a more serious criticism is that paper recognition of a British officer as Acting Sirdar would not in itself safeguard our position for long. In recent years there have been very numerous examples of British officials, although equipped with full nominal power and responsibility, being rendered helpless by a combination of intrigue and passive resistance in which Egyptians are adepts. I cannot but fear that General Spinks, in spite of the energy and tact which he has proved himself to possess, might before long find his influence so hampered and obstructed that we should have no alternative but to intervene a second time, and that probably in less favourable circumstances. It seems to me evident, therefore, that we must rely on something much broader than the personal efforts, however able and well directed, of one man.13. This conviction leads me to recommend an alternative, and considerably more comprehensive, line of action. It is outlined in Foreign Office telegram No. 67. I would also invite attention to an extract from a letter to Sir William Tyrrell, which is also appended to this paper, in which the considerations which dictated my proposal are developed at greater length.14. It will be seen that I contemplate offering to the Egyptian Government the choice of two plain alternatives. They may either admit their obligation to co-operate with us in a fair and reasonable manner; or they may take the consequences. Those consequences would imply drastic action on our part, by which we should place our security beyond all question. We should be dealing with a potentially hostile force in which British personnel would not only be superfluous, but possibly an embarrassment. The few remaining British officers would, therefore, be withdrawn; the strength of the army would be reduced, no additional armament would be permitted to it; and we should satisfy ourselves by periodical inspection that these limits were not being exceeded and that no foreign influence was being brought to bear. To take action of this kind would in some respects be most unwelcome to us, but it would be unwelcome to the Egyptians in a far higher degree, and I think it likely that before long, if not at once, they would choose the alternative of co-operation with us, to their and our own advantage. As I had occasion to point out two years ago in a Cabinet memorandum, the essential basis of our policy is Egyptian co-operation. It was the basis of Lord Cromer&apos;s policy, and without it the whole administration must break down. Even annexation, were it practical politics, would not provide a remedy. But my policy (I quote from my earlier memorandum) &apos;&apos; is to avoid annexation not to govern Egypt but to leave the Egyptians to govern it whilst securing sufficient power to protect those interests of which we are the guardians.&quot; . Since that memorandum was written events have confirmed the principle. It is now very evident not only that agreed settlements, where they can be obtained, provide us with the most convenient, effective and lasting means of adjusting the various points at issue between us and Egypt, but, conversely, that it will become increasingly difficult for us to maintain intact our existing position, if we seek to rely, more and more frequent^, on the unilateral exercise of a veto alone.[15972] b 2
15. I should be prepared, therefore, to exercise the strongest pressure in order to induce the Egyptian Government to accept the principle of military co-operation with us. If such an arrangement were arrived at, even one of a provisional character, our international position in respect of Egypt, which at present leaves a good deal to be desired, would be greatly strengthened. A considerable step forward would have been taken towards a satisfactory regulation of the whole of our relations with that country, and I believe that we should be in a position to exercise enough influence over the Egyptian army to dispose of any further anxiety on that score.16. A policy essentially similar to that outlined above has been adopted after consultation with the Air Ministry and appropriate instructions have already been sent to Lord Lloyd in response to his request for guidance as to his attitude towards civil aviation. In those instructions it has been laid down that &quot;even if it is impracticable at this stage to conclude any far-reaching agreement with Egypt which would regulate all matters in which our aviation interests, both service and civil, are concerned, some provisional working arrangement is eminently desirable . . . . our guiding principle should be ... . the conclusion of some working arrangement with the Egyptian Government Avhich .... will tend to keep civil aviation outside politics.&quot;A.

io annex.(No. GJ.) (Telegraphic.)Cairo, March 3, 1927.YOUR despatch No. 1410. Recent developments in connection with Egyptian army render it necessary that His Majesty&apos;s Government should consider without delay exactly where they stand in this vital matter, and unexpected urgency of some of the issues involved makes it imperative for me tc approach you by telegraph.2. Position in brief is that erosion of our influence, which has been going on steadily since 1922, has recently become far more rapid and has been accompanied by proposals for substantial increases in both numbers and armament. In spite of plain indications from me that these proposals would not be favourably viewed by His Majesty&apos;s Government, they are being proceeded with, and we are in danger of being presented at an early date with faits accomplis.3. Principal stages in the decline of our control of Egyptian army in some detail are as follows : (a.) Azmi Pasha, on appointment as Minister in November 1922, created a special section in his Ministry for settling under his personal direction a number of minor matters hitherto dealt with by the Sirdar. This encroachment grew until, in September 1923, he went so far as to dismiss for inefficiency on his own responsibility a number of students from the military school. The Sirdar raised no effective objection, and in pursuance of his policy of effecting gradual Egyptianisation of the army, began to use Minister as a channel for his communications with the King.(6.) In January 1924, in accordance with this policy, command of Cairo district was ceded to an Egyptian, the post of Inspector-General being created and filled by a British officer. Simultaneously the last two Egyptian battalions in Egypt under British command were taken over by natives.(c.) In March 1924 Shahin Bey, who had been attacked by Wafd for alleged. brutality in pacifying provinces in 1919, was placed on pension by the Sirdar in view of intransigeant attitude of Zaghlul Pasha, with whom it was desired not to risk a crisis in view of impending&quot; negotiations (see Lord Allenby&apos;s despatch No. 257). The effect of this decision on the army was profound, as Lord Allenby himself recognised.(d.) Hassib Pasha, who became Minister of War on advent to power of a Zaghlul Cabinet later in the same month, worked hard to make the army a political machine, and offered determined opposition to proposals on the part of the Sirdar to recruit new British officers for service in Egyptian units in the Sudan.(e.) On murder of the Sirdar in November 1924 Lord Allenby recommended His Majesty&apos;s Government to maintain but postpone their previous intention of appointing an Egyptian Sirdar. His Majesty&apos;s Government agreed, and King fuad was informed of this intention in the following May. Further, shortly after murder, Lord Allenby, so far from discouraging growing powers of Minister of War, proposed to force responsibility upon him in respect to disposal of Egyptian officers expelled from the Sudan.   (His telegram No. 439.)(/.) In January 1925 the Army Council was formed at the instance of King fuad (Lord Allenby&apos;s despatch No. 92). Its creation radically affected powers inherent in the Sirdarship by making appointments, promotions and decorations dependent upon an officers committee and submissible to the King through Minister.(g.) In April 1925 frontiers administration and departments of supplies and recruiting and, in June 1925, finance department passed under Egyptian army.
(h.) Musa Fuad Pasha on appointment as Minister of War in March 1925 made every effort to suborn army from its allegiance to its British chiefs, constantly holding meetings of officers in his house for the purpose.4. Situation has become speedily worse since return to constitutional regime. Present Minister of War is, in common with most of his colleagues, acutely nervous of parliamentary criticism, which in connection with army is apt to be exceedingly acrimonious. See debate of September last reported by Mr. Henderson in his despatch No. 606.5. Results have been the various proposals set out in my telegram No. 469 and my despatch No. 780, namely, to reduce military service from five to three years with openly declared object of increasing the country&apos;s reserve; to bring nine battalions up to higher establishment; to build new barracks in various places; to abolish many existing restrictions on carriage of arms ; and to create a military air force. In spite of my representations those of the above proposals requiring financial approval are included in draft budget shortly to be submitted to Parliament.6. In addition, determined attempts are being made to deprive Inspector-General of all effective authority and prestige. I was able to check first serious effort of present Ministers in this direction (see my despatch No. 780). But in reply to a question in the Chamber recently he deliberately misstated the position as to devolution of late Sirdar&apos;s powers; and in pursuance of his answer Parliamentary Committee are at present engaged in redefining the functions of the Army Council and Officers&apos; Committee at the expense of Sirdarship and Inspectorship-General. If these attempts succeed position of Inspector-General, who, as you are aware, has for two years been endeavouring to perform duties of Acting Sirdar without rank or pay in circumstances of increasing difficulty, will become definitely impossible. As matters stand indeed Minister, while outwardly friendly, indulges in every kind of intrigue and subterfuge to diminish Inspector-GeneraPs authority (e.g., inspecting units; hearing complaints personally and interfering with army orders), aided by two young Wafd Extremists who are his inseparable companions both in Ministry and elsewhere.7. As regards frontiers administration (which, in, accordance with decision reported in Mr. Henderson&apos;s despatch No. 606, is shown in new budget as amalgamated with coast-guard service administratively a most unsound measure), Minister of War was intending to dispense with five of its seven British officers; and pari passu to replace seconded Egyptian personnel as soon as possible by officers who had either fought for Senussi or been expelled from the Sudan after Sirdar&apos;s death; he actually gave written orders to the latter effect. I have been able to secure retention of all British officers in this administration, but Minister, presumably with the intention of side-tracking them, has in budgeting for thein described posts to be given to most of them in new terms.Further, he proposes to. convert Camel Corps and car patrols into a police force without central authority. Simultaneously Government are studying a project for application of Legal Code in ordinary as opposed to existing tribal way in areas under jurisdiction of administration, a change which would greatly weaken position and prestige of Governor. All these steps are taken beyond doubt with a view to render nomadic tribes amenable to political influence and pro tanto diminish our influence over them.8. As regards terms of service, Cabinet has, on recommendation of Minister of War, decided in the last fewdays to offer greater number of British officers and officials employed in various departments for which he is responsible and affected by Law No. 28, contracts of one year only; none are to have more than two years.9. I learn finally to-day that Parliamentary Committee yesterday discussed a proposal by certain Deputies to replace present Ghaffir system by a force raised under conscription law and trained by army officers. While such a proposal will presumably be rejected on grounds of expense, fact that it is under consideration of committee is an indication of the attitude which we cannot disregard.10. Summary of comparative strength of Egyptian army in 1914, 1922 and 1926 and my recommendations for dealing with the present situation follow by telegram.
Lord Lloyd to Sir Austen Chamberlain. (Received March 4.)(No. 62.)(Telegraphic.)   R. Cairo, March 3, 1927.MY immediately preceding telegram.1. Following table shows comparative strengths of Egyptian army in Egypt in the years 1914, 1922 and 1926 respectively: Infantry battalions .... .... .... ....     3 7 11Artillery batteries .... .... .... ....     1 1-4Garrison artillery companies .... .... ....     1 - 1 2Cavalry squadrons .... .... .... ....     1 1 2Staff and departmental services .... 2,500 4,800 10,5812.   The above increases are explained as follows: (a.) Infantry. In 1914 there were six Egyptian battalions in the Sudan. Of these, four battalions were brought down from the Sudan during the war; two returned and two remained. Two were finally retrans-ferred from the Sudan between 1922 and 1924. The last two were ejected from the Sudan in November 1924, i.e., after the Sirdar&apos;s murder. Two new battalions were raised in 1925 (both on higher establishment, i.e., 800, as opposed to 600, strong) mainly to employ Egyptians turned out of the Sudan battalions and civil appointments in the Sudan in November 1924.(b.) Artillery. Three batteries and one garrison company were ejected from the Sudan after the Sirdar&apos;s murder.(c.) Cavalry. One new squadron was raised in 1925 to absorb personnel ejected from the Sudan.3. In addition to above the body guard which has been created since 1922 now comprises one squadron of cavalry and one battalion of infantry, i.e., 39 officers and 976 other ranks.4. Staff. Egyptian army was in 1914 under British control, Sirdar being resident in the Sudan. All headquarters and departmental staffs were then British. To-day there are only nine British officers serving in the Egyptian army, and only one of them Inspector-General (who is acting as Sirdar though Egyptian Government refuse to call him more than Inspector-General) has executive command.5. Armament. 1914 : Six 2*95 guns. Four &apos;450 maxims. &apos;303 old pattern M.-H. rifle.1922 : Four 21)5 guns.   &quot;303 new patterns M.L.E. rifles.1926 : Artillery : Two 3&apos;75 howitzers pack. Twelve 2*95 guns. Six 10-pounder guns. Pour Vickers machine guns. &apos;303 S.M.L.E. rifles. Frontier administration. Three Lewis guns. Body guard. Six Vickers machine guns. Two Hotchkiss machine guns.   Six Lewis guns.(3.)Lord Lloyd to Sir Austen Chamberlain. (Received March. 10.)(No. 74.)(Telegraphic.) Cairo, March 9, 1921.MY telegrams Nos. 61 and 62.1. Army has now become crucial point in Anglo-Egyptian relations, and issue is one which I submit we can no longer shelve.2. History of the question since 1922 shows that each Minister of War in turn, of whatever political complexion, has pursued from the start a policy of active hostility to our rights and interests.3. There can be little doubt that one reason for this significant fact is that no Egyptian Government has yet apprehended His Majesty&apos;s Governments application of 1922 declaration to Egyptian army.   Not only have no limitations
been imposed upon strength of its units in Egypt in virtue of the declaration, but surrender of those units to native control was to all intents and purposes encouraged; and subsequent developments were acquiesced in without protest. Successive Egyptian Ministers must have realised none the less that their programmes directly affected one and indirectly, but hardly less definitely, two more of the four reserved points ; increase in military strength of Egypt that is to say cannot but menace security of our imperial communications (notably the Suez Canal), complicate our defence of the country against foreign aggression and render our protection of foreign interests more difficult. Uncertain, on the other hand, how far we should in the last resort allow them to go, they have felt as Orientals are apt to do that they must leave no stone unturned to gain maximum. The progress made by successive Ministers in consequence has been substantial and has become steadily more rapid.4. To the Egyptian generally military display has a strong appeal; and politicians have turned this sentiment to account by affecting to be ashamed of the present army representing its methods and equipment as antiquated and decrying its value as a fighting force. They argue that this state of affairs is the outcome of a deliberate policy of obstruction on the part of His Majesty&apos;s Government.5. General Officer Commanding, so far from confirming these allegations, considers Egyptian army compares not very unfavourably in turn-out and drill with British troops. This, which confirms my own impressions, is undoubtedly due primarily to personality of the present Inspector-General. The main point of distinction between the two armies here, apart from the fact that Egypt does not possess deadlier kinds of modern lethal weapons, is, in General Haking&apos;s view, the indifference of Egyptian officer class.6. As you are aware, I have since I first came here given a succession of friendly warnings to the King, Prime Minister, the Ministers for Foreign Affairs and War and Zaghlul himself. None the less a programme more and more menacing to our position is being steadily proceeded with in defiance of our wishes. We cannot, I submit, tolerate this. The officials question which has tied my hands for so long is in principle at least now decided; and further inaction with regard to army after my repeated representations could only be construed as weakness. It would indeed almost certainly be attributed to your preoccupation with China.7. In my view time has now come for us to communicate our requirements to Egyptian Government in plain terms and adhere to what we say at all costs. If we do so those costs, given all circumstances, are likely in the end to be small in comparison with what we should otherwise be forced to pay later. I agree in principle with Secretary of State for War&apos;s opinion, as expressed in last paragraph of enclosure in his letter to you of 21st May, 1925 (your despatch No. 560).8. We are faced with (a) certain concrete proposals (b) insidious attempts to undermine powers and prestige of Inspector-General and of british officers under him and in frontiers administration and coastguard service, (c) the gradual saturation of the army with politics.9.   To take principal proposals in turn: (a.) Raising of nine battalions from lower to higher establishment.This proposal is intended primarily to bring these battalions up to numbers customary elsewhere, and simultaneously to secure uniformity with other two battalions.It will involve an addition of thirty-six officers and 1,620 other ranks. Of itself such an increase would not seriously affect military situation.(&amp;.) Reduction of period of colour service from five to three years.This is advertised to increase trained reserve, but it is primarily a bid for popularity with fellaheen. It has ample sanction in practice of other countries. Given limitation of actual rifle reserve to its present figure danger in this proposal should not be great. The calling up of reservists in a time of emergency would in any case be a matter of great difficulty in this country.(c.) Purchase of twenty-two machine guns for eleven infantry battalions.Mules and harness for these guns have been here since July 1925, Lord Allenby having, as you are aware, waived any objection to them.
JL V o(4.)Lord Lloyd to Sir Austen Chamberlain. (Received March 10.)(No 75.)(Telegraphic.) Cairo, March 9, 1927.MY telegram No. 74.1. In reviewing problem my primary object has been to find, if possible, a solution which present Government could reasonably be expected to accept.2. Our first step must, I submit, be to restore authority and prestige of present Inspector-General. On creation of Sudan Defence Force in January 1925, Huddleston Pasha, on Lord Allenby&apos;s instructions, delegated his powers in Egpyt to Inspector-General (Lord Allenby&apos;s telegram No. 31). The Egyptian Government were so informed ; but they have never called Inspector-General Acting Sirdar though he has carried out duties of the latter post ever since. I propose we-should demand that his right to these powers should be acknowledged; also that he should, as is normal, be given acting rank of Ferik (corresponding to that of a divisional commander) with a suitable increase in salary.3. I should propose to insist, further, on appointment of a senior British officer at headquarters to act for Sirdar in his absence. He might be called Assistant Inspector-General. We manifestly cannot continue to depend entirely on one executive officer without provision for his absences on leave or through sickness. Indeed, were General Spinks forced to vacate Inspectorship-General to-day owing, for example, to ill-health, no one could possibly succeed to the highly anomalous position which he occupies.4. Finally, it being, I agree, axiomatic that a British officer holding His Majesty&apos;s commission should not serve under an Egyptian officer except in advisory capacities (Secretary of State for War&apos;s memorandum enclosed in your despatch No. 1261 of 1924) we must insist on frontiers administration (which will involve coastguards also if effect is given to proposed amalgamation) coming under Inspector-General. Under present conditions position of officers in these depart-ments is becoming more and. more difficult.   -5. Concession by Egyptian Government of above, combined with our retention of posts which we at present hold would, I submit, enable us safely to acquiesce in raising of nine infantry battalions from lower to higher establishment, in reduction of military service from five to three years, and in- development of a military air service on lines proposed (my immediately preceding telegram, paragraph 9).6. We cannot, however, I think, in view of recent developments, allow Egyptian Government the twenty-two machine guns.As I interpret views of Secretary of State for War (Lord Allenby&apos;s despatch No. 560 \ such an augmentation of strength, combined with other proposals described above, would involve His Majesty&apos;s Government in an increase of [15972] &apos; CThe frontiers administration and bodyguard possess machine guns, and His Majesty&apos;s Government&apos;s failure to confirm Lord Allenby&apos;s permission is a subject about which present Egyptians are exceedingly sensitive. On the other hand, so large a number of guns is a very serious addition to strength of Egyptian army.(cl.) Frontiers administration and coastguard service.Proposed amalgamation of these two departments was, as explained in my telegrams under reference, certainly designed to undermine our influence over them, and has been accompanied by a recrudescence of intrigue amongst nomadic tribes. I am advised that amalgamation may be found impracticable for administrative reasons. But we clearly cannot speculate on such a contingency.(e.) Military air force.Egyptian Government are proposing to start a military air service&apos; on a modest scale (my despatch No. 70).My immediately following telegram sets out and discusses various solutions open to us.
garrison here and make it necessary to insist that no Egyptian troops should be stationed on the Suez Canal or along the Cairo-Ismailia communications. Further, General Officer Commanding points out, first, that in preservation of internal security every humane Government avoids use of automatic weapons&apos; secondly, that in the event of our being involved, for example, in anti-dynastic disturbances (which certain sections of Wafd undoubtedly desire), the native soldiery would probably join the mob, and, if armed with machine guns, would render it very hard for our troops to restore order without bloodshed.7. Above represents my considered opinion as to way in which problem should be handled. To consider a second course open to us, if Egypt prefer an Egyptian Sirdar we should, I submit, revert to terms offered to Ziwar Pasha (see my telegram No. 149 of 1926), agreeing in this event also to acquiesce in the three proposals mentioned in paragraph 5. But present Government have already intimated that they would never agree to terms set out in that telegram, and their present policy is clearly to render Sirdarship unnecessary. Moreover, we should, for reasons already explained, now have to add further conditions on the same lines in respect of frontiers administration and coastguard service.8. A third possibility, namely, that of insisting on a gradual reduction of Egyptian army, has been rejected by you (your despatch No. 1410). We might perhaps offer in negotiation as a possible solution, pending a general settlement, to equip an effective modern force of, say, 5,000 men under old-time complement of British officers; but it is an offer which Egyptian Government would almost certainly refuse.9. Any of the three courses suggested above would probably suffice to arrest present process of erosion of our rights and also to a large extent prevent contamination of the army with political influence.10. Withdrawal of all British personnel, on the other hand, which Sir Lee Stack had originally in mind, would be exposed to objections (a.) That fulfilment by Egypt of guarantees which we should have to demand would be impossible to enforce. (&amp;.) That army would very rapidly become a political machine, (c.) That as regards foreign affairs we should lose our present influence overArab tribes without any compensating advantage.11. Question before His Majesty&apos;s Government is, in the essence, simple. Are we going to stand by 1922 declaration or are we not ? We are dealing with a Government which has refused to admit validity of the four reserve points. We could work with it as with any other Government which tacitly refrained from violating them; but with Parliament behind it no Egyptian Ministry, unless we clearly state our demands, will adopt a negative policy with regard to us; and if we do not make a stand now I cannot see where we ever shall. Nor can we afford to disregard opportunities which weakness in such a matter at this juncture will create for foreign intrigue.12. At present moment we are faced with three proposals (paragraph 5) to which Egyptian Parliament is almost certain to agree which are not very dangerous in themselves and to which any objection on our part will, in view of our past attitude, be represented as harsh and illogical. To allow effect to be given to these proposals pending a general settlement in return for arrangements described in paragraph 2 to 6 above would be an eminently reasonable course; and I do not see how we could conceivably ask for less.13. I cannot go so far as to guarantee that Ministry will accept even such proposals as I have indicated; but if it refuse them we shall be the better placed for having made so fair an offer.14. I have fully consulted General Officer Commanding, who agrees with above.15. Matter is urgent in view of speed with which parliamentary committee is progressing with its work. I should be grateful therefore if His Majesty&apos;s Governments decision could be communicated to me by telegraph as soon as possible.
(5JSir Austen Chamberlain to Lord Lloyd (Cairo).(No. (P.)(Telegraphic.) Foreign Office, March 11, 1927.YOUR telegram No. 75 of 9th March: Egyptian army.1. I agree with you that we cannot allow matters to drift further, and that we must make up our minds at once how to handle this very awkward problem.2. Whatever policy we adopt will have to be carried through to success. It must therefore be so obviously reasonable and constructive that it will not only be immune from serious criticism at home, but will justify recourse to extreme measures to enforce it. Mere insistence on strengthening the British element in the Egyptian army by itself would not fulfil this condition and would be unlikely to prove effective for long.   Something broader is wanted.3. It must be remembered that the Ottoman firmans limited the Egyptian army to 18,000 men, and that in our letter of 19th December, 1924, we said to Sultan Hussein that &quot; with the Ottoman suzerainty there will disappear the restrictions heretofore placed by the Ottoman firmans upon the numbers and organisations of Your Highness&apos;s army.&quot; It is therefore obvious that any limitations upon which we now insist are designed exclusively in our own interest.4. It appears to me that we might try to achieve our purpose by placing two alternatives before the Egyptian Government, either of which would satisfy our strategical requirements. The first alternative (a) which I have in mind would be based upon the theory that the Egyptian Government were not prepared to co-operate with us in ensuring the defence of the country and the preservation of the army from political contamination, which has been the downfall of many armies in many countries: that in consequence we should have to regard the Egyptian army as a potential enemy and make our plans accordingly. On this hypothesis we should insist on reduction of effectives to, say, 8,000, including bodyguard, withdrawal of all British officers and instructors, non-employment of foreigners (this would of course apply equally to second alternative), withdrawal of Egyptian troops from Zagazig and Wadi Tumilat, no increase of present weapon strength, no military air force, separation of coastguards from Ministry of War, and possibly of frontier districts administration, though I do not attach importance to this. In addition we should insist upon right of inspection at any time or place to satisfy ourselves that our requirements were being respected (if this was possible in Germany, it can be managed in Egypt).5. Second alternative (b) would be based upon theory that Egyptian Government were prepared to co-operate with us for two-objects described in preceding paragraph. Though we would not ask them to commit themselves to more than a provisional and temporary working arrangement pending a general settlement of all outstanding questions, some such modus vivendi is obviously necessary; under it necessary limitations in effectives and weapon strength of Egyptian army (obviously considerably less drastic than under alternative (a)) can be given a much less disagreeable form and made to appear as minimum Egyptian contributions to a common scheme of defence. Under such an arrangement British officers, i.e., Inspector-General and his deputy (your telegram No. 75, paragraph 3) and British instructional and technical personnel, whose numbers should not be increased except on request of Egyptian Government, would take the form of liaison officers, whose mission it would be to assist Egyptian Government to maintain an efficient and reliable force free from political contamination and capable of fulfilling its share of bargain. The more attractive this alternative can be made to appear to Egyptian sentiment the better.Under it we should naturally be prepared to help in formation and training of a small military air wing, and to ensure its acceptance I would not hesitate to throw in the Sirdarship and, with more reluctance, the twenty-two machine guns.15. Under either of above alternatives it would probably be well to insist on reduction of period of service both in army and in reserve. If such l-eduction is likely to be popular amongst fellahin, why should not we get some of the credit for it ? &apos;7. But rather than choose one of these two alternatives, the Government might prefer to resign. In this case how would you propose to deal with the situation ? I take it that no alternative Cabinet which you might be able to persuade to take office would be prepared to oarry on with present Chamber under [10 97-21 D
ZaghluTs chairmanship, and that consequently dissolution of Parliament would be inevitable. This would, of course, be exactly what King Fuad has been scheming for, and in the result we might find that effect of our policy had been resubstitution of Nashat and the Palace for Zaghlul and the Parliament. Before we decide on action to be taken I should be glad to learn your views on proposals in this telegram, and, in particular, how you would view the eventuality contemplated in last paragraph from the local point of view. It would, of course, give rise to considerable difficulty here.(6.)Lord Lloyd to Sir Austen Chamberlain. (Received March 22.)(No. 88.)(Telegraphic.) Cairo, March 21, 19&apos;27.YOUR telegram No. 67.I agree that whatever policy we now adopt in respect of Egyptian army must be as reasonable, broad and constructive as possible; and proposals in my telegram No. 75 were designed, not only to prevent erosion at present proceeding, but also to afford basis for a more final settlement later.2. If any scheme more compi-ehensive than that which I suggested is, in existing circumstances, politically practicable, I should welcome it.3. Plan of action which you adumbrate, however, would not, I think, have desired result, at any rate in its present form.4.   To take first your two alternatives : (a.) Egyptians would be unlikely, either directly or indirectly, ever to make the admission upon which it depends.(b.) Even if they did so and we carried out threat, we should be left for practical purposes with the same force to deal with as we are now and lose all our officers into the bargain. The Egyptian Government, that is to say, would almost inevitably abandon their temporary barracks at El Arish and their camp at Sollum, leaving the numbers of troops in the Nile Valley the same. A far greater reduction in numbers than that which you suggest would therefore have to be insisted upon.(c.) There are no Egyptian troops between Cairo and the Canal to-day, and only native soldiers on the Canal itself are twenty garrison artillerymen for saluting purposes. Your references to Zagazig and Wady Tumilat are therefore not understood.(d.) If all British officers left Egyptian army, we should lose the fairly effective control which we now have over arms and ammunition; and as for importation of arms, we may soon find ourselves without a British Director-General of Customs, whose control of smuggling can in any case only be partial. A native Director-General would be as likely as not to arrange for secret entry of arms in collusion with extremists.(e.) Inspections which you envisage would presumably be carried out by General Officer Commanding British Troops in Egypt. Though doubtless feasible, they would be fraught with great difficulty and would be a recurrent source of friction.(/.) Egyptian army, reduced, left to itself and refused modern improvements, would at once become a political machine.(g.) Number of discontented ex-officers in the country (already a nuisance to us) would be greatly increased.(h.) It would be hard for us to get punctual and accurate information of what was passing in various units unless we organised an expensive intelligence service; and the use that can be made of information derived from secret sources is always restricted.5. The meaning of your second alternative is not altogether clear to me; but, if I understand it aright, it is, I think, open to grave objection. The Egyptian Government would appear to stand to gain following advantages : (a.) Sirdarship if they&quot; wanted it on terms far easier than what were our minima a year ago.(&amp;.) Probably twenty-two machine guns.(c.) Increases in effectives and weapon strength.(d.) An air force.
(7.)Lord Lloyd to Sir Austen Chamberlain. (Received March 23.J(No. 89.)(Telegraphic.) Cairo, March 22, 1927.MY immediately preceding telegram.1. To revert to my telegram No. 75, the Inspector-General is satisfied that if the powers delegated to him by Huddleston Pasha were formally recognised and he were given a deputy he could maintain our desiderata in Egyptian army for an indefinite period. I see no reason to dissent from this opinion, and in consequence I regard General Spinks&apos;s position as vital point in the whole problem.2. General Officer Commanding, with whom I have discussed your telegram No. 67, is still strongly opposed, for reasons given in paragraph 6 of my telegram No. 75, to allow Egyptian Government the twenty-two machine guns promised to them by my predecessor. I had discussed with General Haking the possibility of throwing these machine guns into scale against four senior British instructional officers (one for each brigade) and such technical personnel as Egyptian Govern-ment might themselves find necessary, pointing out that, from purely political point of view, such a concession would offer the definite advantage of depriving Egpytians, as it would do, of such sense of grievance as politics had inculcated into them on this score. Moreover, Inspector-General feels confident, given full powers, he could control the disposal of these guns sufficiently to minimise their danger. I cannot, however, but defer to objections which General Haking sees to this course from standpoint of his military responsibilities here.8. I have accordingly suggested to him that His Majesty&apos;s Government should make acquisition of these machine guns (always given minimum British personnel necessary to effectively train and supervise Egyptian army in their use) conditional on Egyptian Government carrying out faithfully for a reasonable period their side of arrangement proposed in my telegram No. 75. General Haking concurs in this proposal which I recommend therefore for your favourable [15972] &apos; D 26. In return, they would be asked to affirm co-operative intent and agree only to (a) a shortening of military service -to principle of which they are already publicly committed; (b) if I interpret you correctly, a fixed number of new officers, who as liaison officers could exert no effective influence.7. It would be difficult to describe the Inspector-General as a liaison officer, while simultaneously insisting on a recognition of powers delegated to him by General Huddleston. To-day, with a considerable degree of executive authority, he can only partially prevent infection of army with politics. Similar officers under him must retain their present control of arms and ammunition ; and it is hardly less desirable that we should not lose influence which we at present enjoy in military school.S. I am persuaded that only sure way of excluding politics from Egyptian army in its present stage of development is to control promotions, appointments and decorations on honest lines. If so, there is no real alternative to our proceeding, if we surrender Sirdarship more or less on lines of my proposals to Ziwar Pasha (my telegram No. 149) proposals which present Minister has said he would resign rather than accept.9. We should, I think, be unwise to attach too much importance to the off chance that by reducing length of military service we should gain popularity with the Fellaheen. The Government already hold credit for first move in that direction, and&apos;there is always the consideration that the shorter the period the larger will be number of men conscripted.10. I am of the opinion that an offer of concrete alternatives is unsound in principle. In dealing with Egypt in a matter like this, experience tends to prove that a definite scheme, with a general indication that alternative to its acceptance will be something considerably harsher, is better strategy.11. You will, in light of above, appreciate difficulties involved in lines of action which you suggest.12. Remaining considerations set out in your telegram under reference are reviewed in my immediately following telegram.
consideration. I should propose, however, to treat this question as a separate issue and it might conceivably prove unnecessary to raise it at all. I learn that Minister of War, in anticipation of possibility of a refusal on the part of His Majesty&apos;s Government to allow these guns, recently altered form of his budgetary provision for them in order to give himself a loophole for escape from parliamentary criticism in that contingency; and I shall, I need hardly say, leave well alone if 1 possibly can.4. As regards Frontiers Administration, least in my view that we can do with safety is effectively to preserve status quo ante of 1925, when to our cost we allowed its direction to pass into native hands. To avoid demanding reinstitution of a British Director-General I have suggested that administration should be placed under Inspector-General. The separation of administration from Ministry of War suggested by you is open to objections: (a.) That we should be left with necessity of elaborating safeguards in anentirely new situation. (b.) That Arab tribes can be handled better by a military than by a civilregime.(c.) That so radical and conspicuous a change would be much more difficult for Egypt to accept than the alternative that I have proposed.5. It would in my opinion be a serious error, in view of Minister of Wars recent intrigues, to see frontiers administration left to be dealt with as a separate issue.6. As to tactics, I should propose approaching Egyptian Government on following lines rather than those which you suggest: &quot; We are looking forward to a friendly settlement with Egypt. In any such settlement it is clear that latter must assist us in safeguarding our vital interests. Amongst these are protection of our Imperial communications and preservation of country from foreign aggression. We should like to have Egyptian army as an efficient modern force forming an integral part of our scheme of defence; and we are prepared to give Egypt every assistance in creation of such a force, subject to condition that as it will be called upon to co-operate with us it must be trained on British lines, i.e., by minimum number of British officers necessary.We have lately had to call attention more than once to a definite and disquieting tendency on the part of Egyptian Government to turn their army into a political machine. This, which has been ruin of many armies else-where, has been accompanied by determined efforts to diminish authority of Inspector-General and few other British officers still serving under Ministry of War.These tendencies cannot but be fatal to chances of a friendly settlement of the question ; and, sincerely anxious to lay foundation of a solution satis-factory to both countries, we invite Egypt forthwith to reconsider her position. For the sake of reaching a modus vivendi, we, for our part, are ready to agree to certain proposals to which we have hitherto taken exception, provided that Egypt in her turn will meet our legitimate requirements (my telegram No. 75, with possibly the concession suggested in paragraph 3 above).If Egyptian Government refuse to accept these proposals, they must realise that we are left with no alternative but to regard Egyptian army as potentially hostile to us. In this event we shall be forced to take without delay such measures as we consider necessary to safeguard our rights and interests.&quot;7. The present solution cannot but be temporary, as I observe that you yourself agree, and above seems to me as broad, reasonable and constructive as anything that can be hoped for in the circumstances which I have described, and I conceive you could defend it without difficulty in the House of Commons.8. Whilst I find it hard to believe that Government would in the last resort resign rather than accept such proposals, it is evidently possible that they might, and I agree that we must be fully prepared for such a contingency.9. Whether, in that event, another Minister would take office with Zaghlul as President of Chamber, I cannot foretell with any certainty. A considerable section of Wafd would undoubtedly urge acquiescence in our demands, and they
would not improbably carry out their point against extreme elements, necessity of preservation of constitution being a point on which all parties are in solid agreement. But Zaghlul, whose attitude would undoubtedly be determining factor, is, as you are aware, of completely uncertain temper.10. My general view is that in a matter in which our rights are so clear as this we must go straight ahead, dealing with situation which results ad hoc. Zaghlul, we have good reason to believe, considers rightly enough that Egypt stands to lose more than we do by a crisis with us at this juncture.11. In the event of a dissolution of Chamber, a period of Palace rule might, I agree, prove inevitable. But it should be possible for us to do a great deal towards preventing a return to state of affairs which existed in Nashafs day.12. I have been unable to answer your telegram No. 67 before to-day owing to absence of General Officer Commanding in Palestine. I trust you may be able to let me have a very early reply.(8.)Sir Austen Chamberlain to Lord Lloyd (Cairo).(No. 83.)(Telegraphic.) Foreign Ofice, March 25, 1927.YOUR telegrams Nos. 88 and 89.I shall be much obliged if you will discuss these problems fully with Sir &quot;W. Tyrrell before he leaves. I think that he will be able to assist you by explanations which it is difficult to provide satisfactorily in a telegraphic correspondence, and that consultation with him may lead you to modify some of you conclusions.I would ask you after such consultation to place your final views before me in a comprehensive despatch, as on matters of such moment, intimately affecting other departments, I must seek a corporate decision by His Majesty&apos;s Government.(9.)Extract from a Letter to Sir W, Tyrrell.Foreign Office, March 26, 1927..* * m w * *Lloyd points out in paragraph 5 of his telegram No. 88 he has not clearly appreciated what we were driving at in our telegram No. 67 of the 11th March. As you know, our feeling is that the present outlook and past experience in Egypt all go to show that it is no good merely trying to stand still and that we must move forward and keep ahead of events if we are not to lose ground. The Egyptian army is not the only or even the main problem that faces us, but, since we must tackle it, we ought to do so if possible in a manner that fits in with the general aim of our policy in Egypt. That policy was defined in 1922, and has not varied since. It was to settle by agreement with Egypt the subjects which in those stormy days were incapable of settlement and had to be &quot; reserved &quot; inconsequence. Now 1922 is a good horse that has carried us well and far better and further than I for one ever thought it would but we must not ride it to death, and in any case it won&apos;t last indefinitely. There are plenty of things which it doesn&apos;t cover, and some of them we have settled by agreement or something equally effective, e.g., the termination of martial law (Indemnity Act, 1923), retirement and compensation of officials (Law 28 of 1923), the Ottoman Loans of 1891 and 1894 (Decision of Mixed Courts). All these were moves in the direction of the policy contemplated in the 1922 declaration, and served to remove some of the impediments to its fulfilment. They were present in our minds when our telegram No. 67 was drafted. In that telegram our alternative (a) was intended to be so unwelcome to the Egyptian Government that it would make it easier for them to accept (6). At the same time it was to afford a solution which, failing a better one, would safeguard us. The figure 8,000 was not suggested as definite or final, and we are quite ready to.....- - - -.r. &quot;--t-j-.-&quot;.-!-. t-rrv-,- p-s i r.:-v.&quot; -   . - ,.-    -,.-.t.        -. i-1 &apos;,       .v;i-       i -.1*/: -.- :V.-^\TX^i&apos;.\r-2iT
accept LloycTs view that it would be tactically better not to enter into details with the Egyptian Government. The essential thing is to make it clear to the Egyptians that if they refuse the just and reasonable offer we make them under (&amp;), that we propose to safeguard ourselves regardless of their protests, and that the protest will be far more unpleasant for them than it is for us. But, of course, (a) is only &amp; pis aller and as such to be avoided, if possible.The important thing in our view is not so much to make the Egyptian Government agree to the exercise of specific powers by General Spinks and other British officers as to obtain from them in writing some admission that as a provisional measure and pending a final agreement in regard to the 1922 reserved subjects to which we continue to look forward as the ultimate goal, the Egyptian Government are prepared to co-operate with us in the joint task of ensuring in our common interests the defence of Egypt by the forces available for the purpose, and as a corollary, in maintaining the Egyptian army as an efficient and reliable force, i.e.,- preserving it from political contamination which would make it completely unreliable for any purpose. (The actual wording of the preceding sentence was hammered out with Malkin.)The advantages of such an admission need no elaboration. It would reduce considerably the risk to which we should be exposed in the event of Egypt succeeding in gaining admission to the League of Nations. As you will recollect, the weakness of our position is chiefly due to the fact that an international body like The Hague Court might not regard the army of occupation as covered by the four reserved subjects. It would strengthen our hand in dealing with a foreign Power to whom the Egyptian Government might try, behind our backs, to grant a civil aviation concession. At present we could only base representations on our Monroe doctrine, and it might easily be inconvenient to have to rely on this alone. With the written provisional militar*y arrangement constituting a deed of partner-ship a foreign Government would realise that the consent of both members of the firm would be required to anything affecting the strategical safety of Egypt. Finally, the provisional agreement should go some way towards lifting both the Egyptian army and the army of occupation out of the political arena where they are always dangerous elements. Remember that it is our military agreement with Iraq, which is in fact an agreement to collaborate, that enables us to under-take to back Iraq&apos;s candidature for membership of the League.Lloyd&apos;s proposals to secure adequate powers to General Spinks and his British colleagues fit in as subordinate details in the larger and far more important scheme which is our aim, and in which, as indicated in our telegram No. 67, they can be given a form much less wounding to Egyptian susceptibilities. To press Lloyd&apos;s suggestions in their present form involves embarking on a course the ultimate implications of which cannot be foreseen, cf. paragraphs 8, 9, and 11 of Cairo telegram No. 89. To ask the Egyptian Government to recognise the Inspector-General as Acting Sirdar looks at first sight a limited and reasonable objective, and one which Lloyd might very possibly succeed in attaining. But is it really going to be worth while by itself ? Surely the experience of recent years in Egypt has shown clearly enough that the efforts of individual Englishmen, however able and well directed, do not in themselves prevail in circumstances where they are necessarily in conflict with political feeling or intrigue. It seems all too probable that Egyptians would before long contrive so to combat and obstruct the influence of General Spinks, whatever his rank or paper attributes, that the whole issue would have to be reopened, and that very possibly, indeed perhaps probably, in less favourable circumstances. Could anyone&apos;s powers and functions be more clearly defined than those of the Governor of Sinai ? And yet look how easy it is to break his heart and reduce him to impotence, cf. Cairo telegram No. 96. There is a point of minor importance which is perhaps worth mentioning, and that is that the theory of the delegation of General Huddleston&apos;s powers, however academically defensible, is, from the political point of view, a fiction so thin that the less use that is made of it the better.As you know, the dominant consideration in our mind is to get away from a policy of unilateral prohibitions which become weaker the more they are multiplied, and to lose no chance of substituting, wherever an opportunity offers and even in a limited sphere, some constructive agreement or modus vivendi it doesift much matter how provisional it is which will fit in with the general policy of collaboration and not compulsion.
17 (10.)Lord Llotjd to Sir Austen Chamberlain. (Received March 27.)(No. 98.)(Telegraphic.) Cairo, March 27, 1927.YOUR telegram No. 83.My telegrams Nos. 61, 62, 74 and 75 were designed to recapitulate position in Egyptian army fully enough to enable you to refer them to the Cabinet if necessary without amplification.2. My reason for telegraphing has been due to my apprehension lest at any moment we may be confronted with a fait accompli (my telegram No. 61, paragraphs 1 and 2) by action of Parliamentary Committee, inferred to in final paragraph of my telegram No. 75. Such an event will render my representations far more difficult for Cabinet to accept. My main endeavour is to induce Prime Minister to act without appearing to yield to any pressure on my part.3. I have consulted Sir W. Tyrrell in accordance with your instructions, and will have situation reviewed in a comprehensive despatch without delay. At the same time there is, I fear, little that I can add to what is already before you.4. I shall continue to. do all I can to secure delay in parliamentary consideration of objection to proposals, but should my efforts fail, as they very possibly may do, I should be glad to have your authority to take such steps as become necessary.5. In such circumstances I should not fail to offer Cabinet an opportunity of friendly co-operation with us on general lines indicated in paragraph 6 of my telegram No. 89. Their refusal of such an offer would equip you, I conceive, with ample arguments to defend the case which I have submitted to you.o
