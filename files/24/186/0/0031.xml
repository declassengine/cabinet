Printed for the Cabinet.   April 1927.CONFIDENTIAL.CP. 132 (27).EGYPT.I CIRCULATE to my colleagues the accompanying telegrams from Lord Lloyd, together with the reply returned to him regarding the attitude which, he should adopt towards a possible intention on the part of Zaghlul Pasha to assume office as Prime Minister.A. C.Foreign Office, April 25, 1927.No. 1.Lord Lloyd to Sir Austen Chamberlain. (Received April 21, 6-45 p.m.)Cairo, April 21, 1927.(No. 130.) (April 21, 5-20 p.m.)MY immediately preceding telegram.In order that you may see situation in perspective, it is necessary that I should recapitulate a number of significant events which immediately preceded it.2. At the beginning of last month there were sudden signs of a rapprochement between the Palace and Wafd.3. This rapprochement was, to the best of my information, initiated by Barakat Pasha, Minister of Agriculture, in collaboration with Nessim Pasha, Chief of Royal Cabinet, though latter openly attributes it to Mohammed Mahmoud Pasha, Minister of Communications. Barakat Pasha (who was touring the provinces) telegraphed to the King for Ramazan; and His Majesty, instead of replying through Grand Chamberlain as has been the custom, telegraphed back personally signing himself &quot;Fuad.&quot; On 3rd March Zaghlul called on Barakat Pasha, and in a long conversation treated His Majesty with marked deference. On 10th March. Zaghlul, Nahab Pasha (Vice-President of Chamber) and the whole Cabinet were invited [group undecypherable] Palace for Ramazan evening meal. At Bairam, Barakat Pasha received a congratulatory message from Nashat Pasha in Madrid. Finally, the King, on the occasion of his birthday, conferred the Grand Cordon of the Nile on Minister of Communications and elevated Ministers of Public Works, War and Education to the rank of pasha.4.   On the part of Wafd, this complete change of attitude was presumably dueto (a.) Fear that King Fuad&apos;s visit to London so soon after that of Nashat Pashawould lead at least to an exchange of views detrimental to them and thereby involving danger to the Constitution. (b.) Anxiety in consequence to commit His Majesty before his departure to amore friendly attitude towards them and pro tanto render him lessfriendly to us.(c.) Realisation that open and active hostility to King Fuad had been contributing not a little to their undoubted loss of position in the country. (d.) Belief that Adly Pasha would soon resign.(e.) Desire to have ready an alternative coalition acceptable to His .Majesty&apos;sGovernment, but not under Liberal control. (/.) Wish to create appearance of a union of all the elements under Wafddirected against any demands which His Majesty&apos;s Government mightbe intending to make. (g.) Anxiety on the part of Adly Pasha to anchor Government to the side oflaw and order and fortify them against insistent pressure of extremistsin respect primarily of-Omdas Law&apos;(my telegram No. 123).8951 [16051] n
5. King Fuad, whose volte-face created considerably more surprise than that of Wafd, no doubt desired (a.) To have his budget passed by Parliament without acrimonious comment. (6.) To have Nashat Pasha reappointed to Palace or at least left in employ onhis return from Madrid. (c.) To have a Ittehadist element in the Cabinet.(d.) To leave a friendly Government and press behind him when he started for England and to appear in London as truly representative of Egyptian nation.(e.) To prevent his nominees from being ousted from or side-tracked in theAdministration during his absence. (/.) To provide against the possibility of an early return in England of a labour government, which might compromise with the Wafd and thus leave himdangerously isolated. (g.) To be in a better position to shelve revolutionary measures with which theGovernment were [ ? group omitted]ing, notably the Omda Law.6. In the light of these considerations, incidents described above were easier to understand. But it remains none the less a remarkable proof of short Egyptian memories.7. His Majesty sent me a message some ten days ago to the effect that, if, as was always possible, Adly suddenly resigned, would I accept Wassie Ghali Pasha, Minister for Foreign Affairs in ZaghluFs Cabinet of 1924, as Prime Minister, with Ali Maher Pasha. Minister of Education in Ziwar&apos;s subsequent Cabinet, as Minister of the Interior. I replied in effect that I was not prepared to contemplate retirement of Prime Minister, and that I looked to His Majesty with confidence to use his influence to prevent it.&apos;8. I had composed a telegram to you describing and analysing above situation when action of Prime Minister described in my telegram No. 127 put an altogether new complexion on events.No. 2.Lord Lloyd to Sir Austen Chamberlain. (Received April 21, 9 p.m.)Cairo, April 21, 1927.(Nos. 131 and 132.) (A pril 21, 6 -45 p.m.)(R.)  MY telegram No. 129.Exact circumstances of Governments resignation were as follows : 2. In the course of discussion of general financial policy arising out of opening chapter of budget, a member suddenly proposed transfer of a further  1 million from National Bank of Egypt to Bank of Misr. This motion having been referred to Financial Commission, it was followed by another put forward by fourteen members proposing that Ministry should be thanked by the Chamber for encouragement which it has afforded to Bank of Misr, and expressing hope that this encouragement would be continued in a variety of ways specified. An extremist Deputy arose and protested in somewhat intemperate terms that Ministry had done nothing deserving of such thanks; and motion, on being put to the vote, was rejected by a large majority. Only two of the Cabinet, the Ministers of Finance and Wakfs, were in the Chamber, over which Nahas Pasha was presiding. Sitting was at once suspended for ten minutes.3. On resumption of business, Nahas Pasha and several Deputies made statements tending to prove on various grounds that motion did not imply lack of confidence in the Ministry. No Minister, however, put in an appearance, and Chamber was in consequence rising when Adly Pasha entered with several of his colleagues and read a declaration to the effect that such a motion, considered in conjunction with numerous criticisms which had preceded it, left Ministry with no choice but to resign in order to safeguard its dignity.4. Later in the evening he wrote a private letter to the King in the same sense, adding that he would tender his resignation formally next morning. He duly did so, adopting the unusual procedure of presenting His Majesty with a note signed by all
of his colleagues informing His Majesty of their resignation. The King, as reported in my telegram under reference, none the less pressed Adly Pasha to reconsider his decision.  (End of R.)5. Unreality of circumstances described above and their intrinsic inadequacy as a justification for so rapid and unanimous a decision on the part of Ministry will be readily apparent to you.6. I have since had lengthy discussion with the Prime Minister, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and Chief of Royal Cabinet. These discussions, in the light of information derived from my audience with His Majesty and from numerous other sources, enable me to reconstruct what really took place with reasonable certainty.No. 3.Lord Lloyd to Sir Austen Chamberlain. (Received April 22, 9-30 a.m.)Cairo, April 21, 1927.(No. 133.) (April 22, 12-20 a.m.)MY immediately preceding telegram.The following history of events is derived from trustworthy secret information, no fact of any importance having been included that has not received ample confirmation from quite distinct sources. It may therefore safely be taken as substantially accurate: 2. On Saturday last the Prime Minister, in the course of a Cabinet meeting held at the house of a Nationalist, produced a list of parliamentary questions of which notice had been given. The chief of them were concerned with the size and armament of the Egyptian army, the position of the Inspector-General, and the Sudan Defence Force contribution. Adly complained that the persistent raising of these questions would not only be certain to lead to a grave crisis with His Majesty&apos;s Government, but was an infringement of the inter-party agreement on the basis of which the coalition had been formed.3. The discussion which ensued centred primarily round the projects put forward by the Minister of War for increasing the size and strength of the army and for divesting Spinks Pasha of his present powers. When Adly insisted that these projects would inevitably be vetoed by His Majesty&apos;s Government, Zaghlul suggested that the King ought to be able to persuade the High Commissioner not to oppose them, on the ground that public disorder might result from his doing so. At this Adly lost his patience, and replied that he would take the Minister of War with him to see the King in order that he might himself hear His Majesty&apos;s views. They were granted an audience the same day. His Majesty took the line that he could do nothing to influence His Majesty&apos;s Government in the matter. Thwarted in this direction, the Minister of War suggested that armaments should be purchased secretly from a foreign nation. The Prime Minister described this as impossible, for more than one reason; and King Fuad agreed. The Minister of War then stated that unless at least the authority of the Inspector-General were circumscribed in the the manner he desired he would resign. He, the King, again replied that he could not intervene.4. At a meeting with Zaghlul the same evening the Minister of War bitterly reproached the Prime Minister for combating his proposals in the presence of the King and for urging His Majesty to reject them. The Prime Minister thereupon had to submit to severe criticism from the Wafd extremists, led by Maher and Nokrashi, and a long and violent discussion ensued. Adly did not hesitate to speak plainly about various points of difference between him and the Wafd, i.e., the Omdah Law, Arms Law, Egyptian army, and Sudan Defence Force contribution. Eventually discussion again centred upon the Egyptian army, and the Wafd extremists expressed their intention of carrying their proposals by hook or by crook with or without the consent of His Majesty&apos;s Government. The Prime Minister stated emphatically that he could in no circumstances approve this and made a final personal appeal to Zaghlul. The latter, however, replied that he could not agree with the Prime&apos;Minister in face of the attitude taken up by his followers, particularly as he had been receiving assurances from all sides that the British Government were so embarrassed by the situation in China and by domestic difficulties that they were determined to avoid a crisis in Egypt at all costs. Prime Minister thereupon announced his intention of resigning and took his leave.[16051] b 2
5. Next day the Wafd made endeavours to persuade Prime Minister to compromise, but he resolutely declined. It was therefore decided at a Wafd meeting at House of Nation that he should be heckled in Parliament by some procedure just short of a vote of non-confidence.6. Extremists no doubt hoped from the first that this would lead to his resignation being agreed to; that he was useless to them in his present supine mood. The rest of Wafd, on the other hand, believed his threat was a bluff, and rank and file of Zaghlulist Deputies, on gathering to receive their instructions at Wafd Club the same night, were assured that their action would have effect of bringing Prime Minister to heel. When, contrary to their expectations, he informed them of his resignation, most of them were genuinely perturbed, and immediately began a movement to induce him to change his mind, representing that their motion, if properly interpreted, could not be regarded as an expression of lack of confidence.7. Members of present Cabinet, with the exception of Minister of War and possibly of Minister of Agriculture, who is essentially an opportunist, are not in sympathy with the extremists. The latter are intensifying their efforts to persuade Zaghlul to revert to a policy of intransigence, and, if necessary, violence towards His Majesty&apos;s Government. They represent that but for their organised intimidation of us in the past Egypt would certainly not enjoy degree of independence which she. possesses to day, and that this is psychological moment to strike again. The staider elements in Wafd do not consider such aggression practical politics. Between these two points of view Zaghlul remains hesitant and perplexed.No. 4.Lord Lloyd to Sir Austen Chamberlain. (Received April 22, 9-45 a.m.)Cairo, Api-il 21,1927.(Nos. 134 and 135.) (April 22, 4-10 a.m.)MY immediately preceding telegram.1. Prime Minister called yesterday afternoon. While he bore evident traces of strain of the last few days, he was exceedingly frank and friendly. He wished, he said, to express his regret to me that he should have found it impossible to continue in office.- He had received nothing but consideration and courtesy from His Majesty&apos;s Government since he had been Prime Minister, and he was ashamed to appear to be deserting his post. But he could honestly say he had done his utmost to work in agreement with us, if only from the conviction that our present policy was in the true interest of Egypt. In cases where he had failed me, such failure, he asked me to believe, had not been his fault. He had had greater difficulties to contend with than we could ever know of. Zaghlul had again shown himself totally unreliable; and Parliament was simply intolerable.2. Adly Pasha continued that he could not reconsider his decision, since he was now sure that he could be of no further use by staying in office. But I would, he hoped, let him prove his friendliness to His Majesty&apos;s Government by making any use of him I wished. He would, as a private individual, always be at my disposal with such advice and assistance as he could offer. As for the immediate future, he considered that His Majesty&apos;s Government had been the embodiment of patience, and that if any Anglo-Egyptian crisis arose out of the present impasse it would be entirely the fault of the Wafd. He spoke with impressive earnestness and evident sincerity.&quot;? 3.] French Minister came to see me later in the afternoon. He was, as usual, both cordial and outspoken. He had, he said, been closely watching growing-intransigence of extremist element in the Wafd and was fairly sure that their main objectives at present were to capture firstly the Administration and secondly the armed forces of the State. If they succeeded in either, danger to foreign interests here would, in his opinion, speedily become very great. He had been much impressed by a conversation which he had recently had with a French Socialist Deputy who had been staying in Egypt. The latter had stated that a number of Wafdists whose confidence he had gained made, no secret of their intention, as soon as they gained the necessary ascendancy over the army, to launch an anti-dynastic movement. As for Zaghlul, he had come to the conclusion that the latter could never again safely be allowed to return to power.
4. M. Gai said finally that he was reporting his views to Quai d&apos;Orsay, adding that a policy of firm resistance to any revolutionary activities on the part of the Wafd would be endorsed whole-heartedly fey French colony here.5. In the evening Nessim Pasha came to see me ostensibly to give me full story of crisis in accordance with a promise made to me by the King at our interview of the day before. He was, however, unconvincing. It was indeed evident that he was acting a part.6. He described incident in the Chamber truthfully enough as an organised attempt on the part of certain sections of the Wafd to browbeat the Prime Minister. It had met with the failure that so clumsy and ill-considered an attempt had deserved. Wafd were now in a fine state of confusion. Most of the Deputies already bitterly regretted delegates&apos; action, fearing that it might cost them their seats; and their fears were not groundless, for who could succeed Prime Minister? There seemed to be no one to whose nomination insuperable objections could not be offered. Zaghlul, on whom His Majesty was trying to force responsibility of submitting names, was pleading that he was too ill to do so and was, in return, asking His Majesty to send for whomsoever he thought best. Even if Wafd could not actively support Prime Minister chosen by His Majesty, they were, Zaghlul had said, ready to promise at least not to oppose him. His Majesty was, however, far too wise to be caught in such a trap.7. When I remarked that information in my possession led me to doubt genuineness of ZaghluTs professions of ill-health, Nessim Pasha said that he was himself satisfied of their truth. He had found Zaghlul noticeably feebler, a mere shadow, indeed, of his former self.8. Nessim Pasha stated that the King wras very anxious to know my viewrs as regards possible successors to Adly Pasha. I replied that, while I should like to be kept closely informed of developments, I had no suggestions to make at the moment. I thought, however, that His Majesty was very well advised to force responsibility on to Zaghlul, provided that the latter could not thereby be encouraged to aspire to office again himself. Nessim Pasha answered that he was certain, from some remarks which he had exchanged with Zaghlul in a strictly private capacity, that the latter would never dare to make such a suggestion unless he was assured of the approval of His Majesty&apos;s Government. I remarked that Zaghlul was ambitious indeed if he expected such approval after his recent treatment of the Prime Minister.9.   Nessim Pasha informed me, in conclusion, that Prime Minister had, at the request of the King, consented to conduct purely administrative business for the. next few days, but that he would not go to Parliament.    This confirms what Adly Pasha, had himself told me.10. It is a significant and perhaps not unsatisfactory fact that King, the Prime Minister, Minister for Foreign Affairs (with whom I had an inconsequent talk before seeing Prime Minister) and Chief of Royal Cabinet should all have been at pains to leave me under the impression that questions affecting Anglo-Egyptian relations had played no part whatsoever in the present crisis; and I have, I need hardly say, given them no reason to think that f believe the contrary.11. It &quot;is, however, certain from information reported in my telegram under reference that central point of dissension between Prime Minister and Wafd was, in fact, attributions of Inspector-General of Egyptian Army and other cognate matters; and Adly Pasha]s attitude towards intentions of Minister of War amply justifies me you will agree in lively anxiety which I, for my part, have felt with regard to them.No. 5.Lord Llotjd to Sir Austen Chamberlain. (Received April 22, 4-30 p.m.)Cairo, April 22,1927.(No. 137.   Immediate.) (April 22, 3;45 p.m.)MY telegram No. 135.1. I learn from trustworthy sources that confusion continues to reign in Wafd over the choice of a successor to Adly Pasha, and that both moderate and extremist extremist elements are tending to conclusion that only compromise possible is Zaghlul. Both sides still recognise his authority, and believe that they can ultimately influence him in direction they desire.2. The extremists are demanding that Maher and Nokrashi, who are leading them, should be given recommended ministerial rank.     The moderates  are
representing this as insensate folly. Zaghlul, while appreciating risk of such a recommendation, wavers between two points of view.3. Wafd were yesterday letting it be generally known that Zaghlul&apos;s health had suddenly taken a marked turn for the better; and one or two evening papers yesterday gave prominence to report that he would probably take office. One leaflet, which had a sale during the morning, purported to give names of new Cabinet! including Maher, Nokrashi, Ebeid (my telegram No. 28) and Nasr, the Sudanese agitator. Finally, in conversation with me last night, Nessim Pasha, who is clearly acting as liaison between Palace and House of Nation, did not exclude possibility that Wafd might find themselves with no alternative to Zaghlul. It is clear that iii such circumstances- we must decide without delay what we should do in such a contingency.4.   I am of opinion that we should maintain our refusal to accept Zaghlul.5. That argument, set out in my telegram No. 216 of last year, applies, mutatis mutandis, with no less force to-day. Further, in June Zaghlul pledged himself to His Majesty&apos;s Government never to take office again (my telegram No. 276). More important still, he stated categorically at that time that Adly Pasha should have his full support. He has shamelessly broken his word to notables in respect of Omdas Law (my despatch No. 123).6. To his credit stands one fact, i.e., that during early part of the present session he maintained superficial calm in the Chamber. He has, however, countenanced every possible form of intrigue against us below the surface, proving, in fine, conclusively by his actions that his professions of friendship have been insincere.7. The basis of our decision to refuse him last year was that, in view of our responsibility fcr law and order and for protection of foreigners in this country, we could not, in face of his past record, admit him to office unless and until he could give clear proof cf both his intentions and ability to cut himself free from influence of the extremists responsible for murders and disorders which had disgraced his last tenure of office. The events of last few weeks show clearly that he is even more under their influence than before. There is, indeed, no doubt advanced age and ill-health are now undermining a vigorous independent spirit which once characterised him.8. If we allow him to become Prime Minister and disorders again result we should not have a word to say in self-defence.9. Apart from these considerations. I see no tactical advantage in letting him return.10. We should at once find ourselves confronted with a determined attempt to put into execution Omdas Law, the Arms Law and various proposals in respect of Egyptian army which I have already fully reported to you. We should be bound to resist, and such resistance would probably both make Zaghlul a public hero again and pari passu consolidate Wafd.11. I request, therefore, that I may be authorised to let it be known if and as circumstances necessitate that His Majesty&apos;s Government will not permit Zaghlul to become Prime Minister.No. 6.Sir Austen Chamberlain to Lord Lloyd (Cairo).(No. 113.   Important.) Foreign Office, April 24, 1927, 3 p.m.You are authorised to let it be known, if and when you think necessary, that His Majesty&apos;s Government will not permit Zaghlul to take office. This prohibition extends d fortiori to Maher and Nekrashi, and further to any others for example, William Ebeid against whom you consider that the suspicion of complicity in murder is strong enough to justify it.
