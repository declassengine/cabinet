Report of the Committee on Table-ware of Translucent pottery, Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.I have already circulated to the Cabinet the. Report of the Committee on Table-ware of Translucent Pottery.   The Majority Report recommends a duty of 26/- per cwt. on table-ware of translucent pottery and vitrified pottery.   I ask the Cabinet to approve the inclusion of this  duty in the next Finance Bill.It is not disputed that the industry is of substantial importance.    The table given in paragraph 21  (page 10) of the Report,  I think,  shows conclusively that the rate of importa-tlon is abnormal.    It is stated in the Report that home production would be worse than it is but for the preferential rates of duty in the Dominions.    The competition comes principally from Germany and Czecho-Slovakia.    There is no doubt that wages are lower in both these countries.    In these circumstances,  the Chairman and one member of the Committee recommend a duty.The remaining member, i-ir.. Hay hurst,  of the Cooperative Wholesale Society,   is not in favour of a dutyj but his grounds of dissent are,  I think, unreasonable..    His chief ground is that the imported felspar chine   is of a different character from the British bone china..   The other two members of the Committee, however,  observe that the ordinary British buyer regards both types as china, and that therefore the
foreign import,  though, it may differ in character and method of construction,  is in fact an active competitor.    I think this is common sense.    The other main ground of objection advanced by Mr. Hayhurst is that the British industry is not efficient.    His colleagues take a different view,  though they recommend the industry to consider the desirability of amalgamations of small firms end combined selling agencies. In this connection,  the Cabinet should note that the relations between employers and employed in the industry are admirable and that there is a combined organisation in the trsde for research and other matters of general interest to the industry.A duty upon tableware would not adversely affect any o the r i ndus t ry.As my colleagues kno?r,  there has been a good deal of criticism in the Party of the timber of applications which have been rejected by the Board of Trsde in the first instance or by a Committee of Inquiry; and a number of resolutions were tabled at the last meeting of the Central Council of the National Union of Conservative and Unionist Associations. 1 took the opportunity at that meeting of defending the action of the Government, end explained the  reasons why we felt that it was impracticable and undesirable to alter the Vihite paper procedure during the present parliament.    But this defence, of course,  carried with it the implied undertaking, that, within the limits of the White paper, we should impose duties where the claim was established.    The claim here has been established to the eatisfaoti on of e majority of the Committee. In my opinion,  the Report of the majority is right; and, following the orecedent of the Report on Superphosphates,under the white Paper procedure, and Glassware, under the old Safeguarding of Industries Act,  i ask the Cabinet to give effect to the recommendations of the ma jority.P.G-L.Board of Trade,29th March,  1927,
