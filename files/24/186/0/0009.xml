The situation has changed considerably since we last reported on the subject. Amid a numberof uncertain and disquieting faotors there is one important respect in which the situation from a mill-tary point  of view has developed to our advantage, and we wish, to draw attention to this at the very outset of our Report.3. Up to the present/ time our diplomacy has sufferededfrom the fact that&apos; ,ve possess7 few, if any, means of bringing pressure to bear on the Cantonese Government. The means which did exist, such as the bombing of Canton, were of doubtful value and uncertain effect.-1-17&quot;&quot;&quot;*&quot;&quot;.-.;&apos; &apos;        -:TrT^n*-r^*w*rm*w**** .,    i......................r-i--- - -1-.VTT-.-;-?---&quot;T&quot;     .-&apos; ;&apos;- /.:;-.&apos;..,,-,
rj ^In these&quot;circumstances    the agreements made with the Nationalist Government have proved worthless, and that it is only -under the protect!:.-, of armed forces that our nationals are able to live in any sort of safety in China.4. This situation exists no longer.    The last remnant of the armies of North China has retired to the north of the Yangtse and the Cantonese are in occupation of the territory south of the River.    Freed fro;r the complication of the presence of the Northern forces, we are now in a position to take such action as we think fit along the river against the Cantonese.    The period of lowest water has passed, and already it is possible for the British Fleet or for an international Fleet to stop all traffic on the river from Shanghai to Hankow, - a distance of 600 miles.    The result of such action on our part, oonbined (if the Powers consent) with a blockade of the approaches to Canton, would be not only to produce all the economic pressure of a blockade   on the permanent effects of which opinions differ   but,   in addition,  to prevent the Cantonese armies from crossing the Yangtse in pursuit of their Northern eneiries.    In any further advance the lines of communication of thfi Cantonese forces must cross the Yangtse and are at the mercy of our sea-power,,    The manner in which Naval power- can be exploited on the Yangtse,  and the moral effect of strong action on the Cantonese, are well illustrated by the recent case of the S.S. KIANGWE.    This  ship,  sailing from Kiukiang to Hankow, was-stopped by the Cantonese, who embarked 2,500 troops and sent her back to Kiukiang.    Here a British destroyer, H.M.S. WILD SWAN,  intercepted her at Collinson Island, anchored her,  disarmed the  2,500 soldiers and put them on sho re a5. We are aware that it is not the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government to interfere in any way in the civil war in China,  and we do not suggest anything of the kind.   We feel bound, how7ever,  to point out that
nithe international Powers in China, or His Maiesty&apos;s(Jovemrcent separately, now have it in thrir power toprevent the Cantonese armies from advancing to thenorthward and repeating at Tientsin and Peking theoutrages of Hankow, Shanghai (outside the Settlements)and Nanking.    Their diplomacy in any negotiations theymay think fit to undertake in regard to -*uoh matters as reparation for the outrages at Nanking\ a reasonableagreement in regard to Shanghai,&apos;    the cessation of anti-foreign demonstrations in Lhe areas controlled bythe Cantonese, now has behind it the possibility 01 awhich, though reasonably effective, sanction/involves    the minimum prospects of activehostilities or bloodshed.60 We had reached this point in our deliberationswhen we received from the Foreign Office for oururgent consideration copies of telegrams Hob. 540of the 28th March and 547 of the 29th March, fromSir Miles Lampson,  In the latter of which it was stated that the British, Japanese and American Minister;had met and decided to recommend that formidabledemands for punishment, apology and reparation bemade by the Consuls-General at Shanghai to theGeneral Officer commanding the Cantonese army      Thattelegram also indicated the view of the said ministers that the best sanction would be a blockade of the Yangtse and Canton,  which it will be noticed exactlythoughfits in with our views expressed above,/the Importance of our ability to deny the crossing of the Yangtse appears to have been overlooked by the Ministers at Pekingo7o Before any action is taken to give effect to our proposals,  it will be necessary to extricate all British nationals on the Middle and Upper Yangtse.
In a previous report, we&quot;&quot;have-pKrf-rrte-d out that the protection of the smaller Concessions - and this applies equally to British interests at ports where there are no Concessions - must devolve upon the Naval forces, but that the Navy &quot;can only afford protection against mob violence^      If it is a question of dealing with military forces,,  evacuation will usually he. the only course&quot;o    [CiLD. Paper 756*-B)o6. We learn that Sir Mies Lamps on has given definite orders to the Consular officers at Chungking, Shangsha and Ichang to evacuate their ports, themselves Included (Sir Mo Lamp::.on, Peking, telegram 541, dated 28th March, 1927).9o We recommend that, before any action is taken to put pressure on the Cantonese Government of the nature indicated above., definite orders should be given for the evacuation of all ports above Hankow,10* If this recommendation is carried out, andBritish nationals are withdrawn from above Hankow,we see no object in the retention of the British(Appendix a)gun-boats on the Middle Yangtse^ /  The admiralty have telegraphed to the Naval Commander-in-Chiefto Invite his views on the question, and subject tohis reply, we recommend that &quot;-he withdrawal of theBritish nationals should be accompanied by thewithdrawal of the British gun-boats.      Vie understandthat the withdrawal of H*M.S* Mantis, which drawstoe much water to pass down the gorges, may prove a difficulty.      We hope, however, that it may be found possible to overcome this by lightening the ship,possibly even at the cost of jettisoning one or both of the 6-inch guns.      This is a matter on whichthe Naval Commander-in-Chief will advise.   In the last resort it might even bJ necessary to sacrifice the Mantis,  after tho withdrawal of the  crow by H.M.S.Teal4.
1*1 cf*4&apos; i)11The withdrawal from L,L.o Upper Yangtse should systematically organised, be      / proceeding from the highest point on theriver downwards.      We believe that it can be accomplished in a few days, at the outside withina week, of the order being given.&apos;     We suggest thatthe order of withdrawal should be given irrespective of what other nations decide to do, but, as a matterof international courtesy and loyalty, we assume that a warning of our intention, coupled possibly with advice to take a similar course, wou3td beissued to the French, American and JapaneseGovernments, all of which have gun-boats on the RiverYaflgtseo12. Assuming that British nationals have been with-drawn in safety to Hankow and that an ultimatum has been issued, preferably by several Powers jointly but possibly by the British Government alone, to the Cantonese Government,  accompanied by a time lirrit, we contemplate that there should be a considerable- ooneen-tration of warships at Hankow (where the whole of the gunboats from th* upper river will be assembled and whither cruisers of the &quot;C&quot; Class can already proceed) as well as at Wanking and at suoh other points as the Naval Coirmander-in-Chief may decide.    At Hankow and Nanking we should be in a position to interrupt cross-river traffic on the principal lines of railway from South to North GVhina.    The interception of troop move-merits could be accomplished irrespective of other Powers .- o -/ We are informed that though the depth of water at present permits of this,, such a condition does not usually exist before April 15th.      The possibility of a temporary fall in the water during the next two weeks cannot be excluded.
rt i t13.      Provided that we have the support of sufficientfoieign Powers, we could, ir. addition, proclaim a blockade of the Ysngtse and stop all traffic cn the riverfrom Shanghai to Herkow.      All floating craft of every kind should be brought within cur jurisdiction, so that nomovement of any sort could take place on the river without our permission.      In this way cur measures would remain effectiveeven next winter in the period of low water.14.     At first sight there is one difficulty in carrying out the above programme, namely,  the existence at Kiang yin, on  the Yangtse,  of fixed defences.      On paper these defences are very powerful,  and include a 12-inch gun.      such information as the Intelligence Department of the Admiralty War Staff possesses is to the effect that the guns have not been fired for years.      In any event we think that the guns could be dealt with by means of aerial attack and bombardment by ships.      The Admiralty are in communicstion with the Naval Commander-in-Chief cn the subject and unless be reports to the contrary they need not be regarded as a  serious factor in the situation.15.      Simultaneously with a blockade of the Yangtse we recommend a blockade of the approaches to Canton.16,      We do not at present recommend that authority should be o;iven for the occupation of the Bogue Ports, recommended by the Governor of Hong Feng in his/-5-
telegram of March 26th.      This operation would involvethe use of military forces and the occupation of Chineseterritory,,      Insufficient troops for the purpose areavailable at Hong-Kong,-, and those surplus to the garrison of that fortress form part of the Shanghai defence force and ought not to be committed to any otheroperation.      In fact, generally we ere opposed at this juncture to any action which would involve an additionalthecommitment of unknown scope in China involving/land forces.17.  In the event of a blockade at Canton, we recommendthat the Shameen should continue to be held in accordancewith the recommendations of our Report of January 18th,1927 (C.I.D. Paper No. 762-B), the Conclusions of whichwere summarised in paragraph 15 as follows:-&quot;(1) That the British Consul-General at Canton, the Governor and the naval and military authorities at Hong-Kong should receive instructions to the following effect(a) That the men on the spot should have full discretion to hold the Shameen as long as they consider possible, whether against mob violence or against Cantonese troops, with such forces as can be placed at their disposal from Hong-Kong, having regard to conclusion (c). below.(To) That arrangements should be made for the evacuation from Shameen of all non-combatants before serious trouble eventuates,  the exact time for such evacuation being left to the man on the spot-,(c)That no further reinforcements can be despatched to Hong-Kong for the defence of Shameem c * o , ... * *(d) That the use of aircraft, in con-nection with  ,ho defence of Shameen, is permitted; and t&apos;J:,a-;-;. should the situation necessitate it., the shelling of vital points;&apos;in Canton or of the river defences is permitted.
(2)  That,  if considerations other than military allow,  the /-c ting Consul-General, Canton, should he authorised, as proposed in his telegram No ,5 of the 13th January, to inform the General in Command of the Chinese Forces,  Canton, that if Shameen is attacked we shall take such steps as we may think fit, bub that the actual nature of such steps should not be specified.   Also that discretion should be given to him to arrange for a demonstration over Canton by as many aircraft as can be iriade available at the moment that this communication is being conveyed to the Chinese General.(3)  That if Shameen is attacked, a blockade of Canton and the bombing and shelling of vital points (such as magazines, military establishments, etc,)  are among the counter-measures which should be permitted.That immediate authority should be given to the Governor and Raval authorities at Hong-Kong for the use of the Kowloon Aerodrome.&quot;(4)
18.    The interdiction of the passage of the Yangtse by Cantonese troops, the blockade of South China, both on the Yangtse and at Canton, and of the coast bet-een, are not tie sole means by which we can bring pressure to bear on the Nationalist Govermaent, In addition to the above measures it is in our power to seize the Cantonese Wavy,  a list of whioh is attached in Appendix &quot;B&quot;.    These ships possess but little fighting value and probably some of them are unable to move,    Nevertheless,  their seizure would, be a blow to  the prestige of the Nationalist Government and would not be likely to promote indignation in North China, which would benefit by our action.      In the event of it being decided to exercise pressure on the Cantonese Government we,  therefore, recommend the seizure of the Cantonese ships,19,    The steps we have recommended for preventing the Cantonese from crossing the Yangtse should of themselves,  if not too long delayed,  greatly diminish the risk of occurrences at Peking and Tientsin comparable to those at Hankow and Hanking. It Is noticeable that sueh outrages have,   so far, been confined to places occupied by the Cantonese Forces.      In view,  however,  of what has happened elsewhere in China, we cannot exclude the possibility that the nationalism of the South may spread to the North,  and that British interests in Tientsin and even in Peking itself may be exposed to the same sort of danger as in the great cities of South China.
O Io x20.    As regards these places, we draw attentionto the following passage from our Heport ofJanuary 11; 1927.  (0.I.-I). 755-B).:-&quot;Tientglno    At Tientsin the Allied Forces are sufficient only for the maintenance of order in times of popular disturbance, and would be in a position of grave danger if exposed to attaok by a large organised Chinese foroe0    It in doubtfal. if we could keep open commruiloations with, the Legation at Peking in any grave circumstances.    In the event of serious trouble threatening, reinforcements can only &quot;be obtained from Japano    Oilv Naval Forces cannot co-operate, as Tientsin cannot be reached by water,&quot;loftviths * anding iv Miles amps or&apos; s eldest -for an xtra battalion,! Peking &quot;ele-gf air No .542) ,21o   We notice that the British Ambassador at Tokyo, in reporting an interview with the Vice Minister of foreign Affairs, states that tha Yice Minister appeared to realise that the defence of Tientsin would fall on the Japanese. (Tokyo telegram No.  134,  dated 28 March,  1927). In accordance with the principle already mentioned we consider that no additional military commitments should be undertaken in North China, and, conse-quentlyi   that no further British Forces^ at the present  tunetareshouldpresbe allocated/to Tientsin.The Cantonese forces are still some 400 miles from Tientsin, and we shall be prepared to consider the question again if and when the danger is greater.    For the moment,  however, we do not wish to go further than to i-epeat our recommendation that Japan should undertake all military responsibility there.
O 1 0 ^22.    As regards Peking, we consider that Eis Majesty1s Minister must be responsible for withdrawing the Legation if and when he thinks that disturbances are likely to arise which are beyond the capacity of the Legation Guard to deal with.S3.    Prom the above it will be seen that our recommendations amount to this:- That Great Britain should be the pre-dominant partner in action on the Ysngtse and agains Canton, while Japan should be the pre-dominant partner in North China.      All thePowers concerned would,   of course,  place&quot;have such forces as they/available    at the disposal of the dominant partner in either theatre-
24. In   previous Report we stated that -&quot;The importance of seauring International co-operation in any action against China, whether economic or military,, cannot bo too strongly emphasisedo&quot;report of January, 1927.  C.I.D.756-E).25o We cannot over-state        the importance of thisrecommendation at the present juncture,      It is beyond our competence to express opinions regarding the probability of international co-operation.      From a purely military point of view, however, it would be highly advantageous if the Powers whose Interests are threatened at Shanghai and 3ome of whom have suffered in common grievous insults and losses at Banking,could be induced to act together in the manner indicated in this Report. Itis ebvious that their position in regard to the many problems vis a vis the Cantonese which must be settled internationally would be much stronger if they had behind them e basis of united military sanctions.     The sanctions we propose are, as already mentioned, comparatively free from the risk of serious losses or bloodshed.
0 1 0 *S U M M A R Y.26. Our conclusions and recommendations may be summarised, as follows:-(l)  Amid many uncertainties and-disquietingevents, the situation has developed to otir advantage, from a military point of view, in so much as south of the Yangtse we have to deal only with the Cantonese, and. any pressure we put on them will no longer operate equally on the Northern Chinese, who have not treated us with the same vindictive spirit as have the Southerners.(2) Before any steps ars taken to put military pressure on the Cantonese, arrangements must bo made to complete the withdrawal  o^ British nationals from the Yangtse above Hanhow.    We recommend that the withdrawal should take place at once in an orderly manner, beginning at the highest point on the river o&apos;3)  Sxibject to the views of the naval commander-in-Chief, we recommend that at the same time the British gunboats should be withdrawn from the river above Hankow and concentrated at that port.   The Naval Commander-in-Chief must make the best arrangement he can in regard to H.M.S. MANTIS, which probably draws too much water to pass down the gorges in the present ccndi-tion of the rivero(4) We recomirad that, before the gunboats are withdrawn,   the French, American and Japanese Governments, who also have gunboats above Hankow,  should be informed of our intentions.(5)  If His Majesty&apos;s Government wish to put pressure on the Cantonese Govern-nrient, the following measures are available to them:-(a)  If compelled to act alone. -    Inter-ruption of the passage of troops across the Yangtse at the railway centres  at Hankow and Nanking and elsewhere below Hankow:    interruption-tion of purely Chinese traffic on the Yangtse:    seizure of the Cantonese fleot;    and (if th* con-sent of the Powers can be obtained) a blockade of the Yangtse and of the approaches to Canton.    (This is subject to  a favourable reply from the Naval Commander-in-Chief regarding the strength of the defences&quot;of the Yangtse at Kiangyin.)
(b)  If acting with other powers the above, supplemented by a completeblockade and river traffic the control of all on the Yangtse.(6)  The attack of the Bogue Fort covering the approaches to Canton is not at present recommended,  as it would involve the use of troops now at Hong-Kong but - forming part of the Shanghai Defence Force,Any new commitment of our land forces in China should be avoided,at this juncture(7) (8)notwithstardi? Si r Viles Lampson&apos;s request for av addi f i oral Pa* t ali on fPskiUs Tele-grrv   No ,542) .The risk of trouble at Tientsin and Faking should be reduced by the measures proposed above.    A&apos;e do not at present recommend an increase in__s the British garrison at Tientsin,,We consider that the Japanese should be mainly responsible for the protec-tion of Eritish interests there.    The British Minister should withdraw the Legation and British interests from Peking, if threatened by forces beyond the power of the naval Legation guards to  resist.(9) Broadly we recommend that the British should be the predominant partner on the Yangtse and. in South China, and the Japanese in North China,  the available forces of all co-operating Powers being placed at th^disposal of the predominant partner.(10) At the present juncture wa wish to repeat and emphasize the insistence we laid in previous Reports on the importance of international as opposed to separate British action in China, if by any moans effective co-operation can be orga.ni.sed.2, Whitehall Gardens,  S.W.1, March 29.  1927.
