SECRET. Copy No.  30CP. Ill (27).CABINET.CHINA.Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.WE have now decided to instruct Sir Miles Lampsonto procure if possible the assent of the United States and Japan to a joint demand upon Chiang Kai-shek for a three-fold reparation of the Nanking outrages ; and we have shown Sir Miles Lampson the sanctions we are able and willing to apply. So far so good. We are no doubt wise to see what will be the response of the other two Powers before addressing ourselves to the question of isolated action by Great Britain ; and certainly it is good policy to conduct these preliminary discussions with the other Powers in relation to specific demands about Nanking&quot; where they have both received such provocation.But the Report of the Chiefs of Staff* shows that we possess the means of applying formidable pressure to the Cantonese, by blockade, by the seizure of their Fleet, and by preventing&quot; them from crossing the Yangtse and spreading the Bolshevik anti-foreign and anti-British agitation through Northern China. It would seem a pity to use these weapons merely for the small, local and temporary object of extorting an apology and a few thousand pounds compensation for Nanking. Par greater interests are at stake Shanghai, the millions required for the British Defence Force, the injury to our trade in China and to our prestige throughout the East. We ought not to waste a steam hammer on cracking a nut, but to make sure we use it for the main purpose and to relieve us from the ill-treatment we are suffering&quot;. What we require is not an apology but a settlement: not a settlement like that at Hankow,CP. 110 (27).Printed for the Cabinet.    March P.127.

It would seem a pity to use these weapons merely for the small, local and temporary object of extorting an apology and a few thousand pounds compensation for Nanking. Far greater interests are at stake Shanghai, the millions required for the British Defence Force, the injury to our trade in China and to our prestige throughout the East. We ought not to waste a steam hammer on cracking a nut, but to make sure we use it for the main purpose and to relieve us from the ill-treatment we are suffering. What we require is not an apology but a settlement: not a settlement like that at Hankow,15960(.-.P. 110 (27).Printed for the Cabinet.   March 1W27.
where through being militarily powerless we were forced to surrender, but a settlement in accordance with our legitimate and permanent interests in China.Supposing&quot; that the other Powers show themselves disposed to co-operate in the demand for an apology, ought it not to be our policy to draw them forward into action designed to effect a radical cure ; and ought we not to be prepared to use, preferably in concert, the undoubted leverage which we possess to secure an effective solution of the whole problem ? Can we not try to get into a position where we could say to Canton : &quot;We arc ready to negotiate honourable treaties with you, but we will not do so without sure guarantees against the ill-treatment of our nationals when they trade. These guarantees may take various forms, but the chief must be the expulsion from your bounds of all Russian agents, for it is they, and they alone, who have caused the troubles between us.&quot;I do not suggest this as an immediate step but only as the goal towards which we ought steadily to work. It would not be at all out of keeping with the Chinese character, and might also be in harmony with the interests of Chiang&quot; Kai-shek and the Moderates, to consent to the expulsion of these Red Russians who are seeking&quot; to reduce China through Communism to Muscovite vassalage. At any rate my feeling is that that is the point at which we should aim. With the malignant influence of the Red Russians out of the way we might soon be able to make a good arrangement with the native Chinese.W. S. C.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1, March 31, 1927.
