DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC majesty&apos;S GOVERNMENT).&quot;   SUPPLY OF INFORMATION REGARDING SOUTH IRISH COAST DEFENCES TO TECHNICAL&quot; REPRESENTATIVES  OF THE IRISH FRE^I STATE GOVERN: iKNT NOW IN LONDONTMemorandum by the Secretary of State for DominionState Government contemplated by Article 6 of the Articles of Agreement of 1921 took place on the 6th of December last.     No business could be transacted as neither Government had completed its preparations, and arrangements for the next meeting have been deferred pending the receipt of information from the Free State Government as to the nature and extent of the share which they desire to take in the coastal defence of the Irish Free State.     With a view to providing the Free State Government with the necessary technical information on which to base their- proposals in this respect, it was thought desirable to put the experts of the Irish Free State in touch with our own experts and an informal meeting between ^representatives of the Admiralty-, the War Office and the Air Ministry and experts^ sent by the Free State Government took place at the Admiralty on the 26th of April.E CRET.135 (27).C -A BIN E T..Affairs..A formal meeting of the Conference with the Free$   The Free State representatives were the Secretaries to- the Executive Council and the Department of Defence,  Kie Chief of. Staff and a representative . of the Department&apos;of Finance.
At this meeting the principal Free State representative asked for- information which would enable his Government to consider the question of taking over and maintaining the forts at the three defended ports.     He said that the Free State Government recognised that, in view of the training of personnel and the expense involved,  it was possible that the transfer might have to be effected by degrees.In reply to this request the Free State representatives were informed that theinstructions of our Service representatives did not permit them to discuss this matter,as it was outside Article 6 of the Treaty.The Free State representatives stated, however,that their Government read Articles 6 ahd 7together.      It then appeared that the FreeState representatives had no other instructions as to obtaining information regarding theircoastal defence, and it was agreed that untilour representatives had obtained further instructions the question of the defended ports would have to be deferred.      The meeting was therefore adjourned,
the Free State representatives remaining in London and being given to understand that the matter would be laid before Ministers as soon as possible.It would appear that there are two alternative courses which could be adopted with regerd to this request for information:-(a) To refuse the information, in which case it appears probable that the informal discussions would come to an immediate ond.      It is understood that the Free State Government would then raise the matter at the full Conference.(b) To allow the Service Departments to give the information on the clear understanding that this would be without prejudice to the question of the transfer of the charge cf the harbour defences, which would be left for Ministers.The adoption of (a) would not prevent the cuestion of the transfer of the defended ports from arising at the full Conference and a refusal of the desired information now will only make the atmosphere more unfavourable when it does arise,I am therefore strongly of opinion that we should adopt course (b), and I feel convinced that the giving of such information would not prevent our a don ting any attitude which we thought fit at a later stage.Copies of Articles S end 7 of the Articles of Agreement snd of the Annex thereto are attached.LvS .A.Dominions Office.
