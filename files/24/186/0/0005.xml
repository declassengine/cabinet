The draft Bill (except in Clause 5) proceeds upon the principle that in future contracts the  landlord is not to bo permitted without express payment to appropriate to himself value created by the tenant.      It does not recognise that there is any property in the holding acquired by the tenant -which of course would have to be secured to him in any event. Thus the tenant&apos;s improvement if it adds to the resources of the landlord is to be paid for.      But if the premises of which it forms pant are to be demolished it is to bo ignored, a treatment impossible if any right of property had been acquired by the tenant.      Similarly, goodwi 11 created by the tenant and attaching to the premises is not to inure to the benefit of the landlord without compensation.      But if the purpose of the premises is to bo changed and this goodwill t-erefore to disappear, no compensation is proscribed for there is no right of property which can be violated.Clause 5 however proceeds upon a different principle. It deals neither- with improvements nor with goodwill attached to the premises, but with any other loss the tenant may suffer by removal.      And in respect of this loss the tenant is to have a remedy even though the landlord has no intention of appropriating to himself any part  of the value created3 DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT) .C RE T.

by the tenant0     As the Clause stands even though the tenant does not suggest any such appropriation he may ask the tribunal to compel the landlord to give him a renewal. It is true that the tribunal in its decision is to have regard to the principles of good Estate management and In particular that the renewal is to be barred in certain cases,  if for example ther-e is an intention to re-develop the estateo     Undoubtedly these limitations are very far-reaching 0     But even if it could be shown that they remove all the practical mischief from the Clause - which I do not admit - I should still be opposed to a Clause which recognises that the tenant owns something in the premises for the loss of which he must be compensated by a renewal, instead of merely preventing the landlord from appropriating value created, by the tenant 0       The first accepts the principle of duel ownership, the limitations on which in the draft Clause will soon be swept away.      The second merely prevents the landlord from cheating the tenant0I submit therefore that Clause 5 requires amendment by inserting words limiting the right of the tenant to ask for a renewal to cases where the landlord can be shown to be appropriating value which belongs to the tenant.      For this purpose it is probably essential that the landlord or his agent should be submitted to cross-examination,    A draft on these lines is appended.S.March 26th,  1927.
(1) Where the tenant alleges -fa) that such compensation as is provided in the last foregoing section will not compensate him for the loss he will suffer if he removes to and carries on his trade or &quot;business in other premises;(b) that his immediate landlord or any superior landlord has refused to grant or to concur in granting a new lease to commence at the expiration of the existing tenancy, or has refused to grant or to concur in granting him such a new lease except on terms which will exact from him a rent in excess of the fair market rent of the premises;he may at any time not more than eighteen nor less than nine months before the expiration of the tenancy apply to the tribunal for the grant of such a new tenancy.(S)  If on such an application the tenant satisfies the tribunal that his allegations are true,  the tribunal may require any landlord who has so refused as aforesaid to appear before It and give evidence as to the reasons for his refusal;    and if it appears to the tribunal that the landlord has so acted with a view to obtaining for the premises a rent in excess of what in the opinion of the tribunal is the fair market rent of the premises,  and thereby to appropriate to himself a value created by the trade or business carried on by the tenant or his predecessor in title,  the tribunal may order the grant to the tenant of a new lease commencing at the expiration of his tenancy for such period (being a term of years absolute)
and on such terms as the tribunal may determine to be proper;    so, however, that the rent fixed shall be the rent which in the opinion of the tribunal is the fair market rent:/provided that the tribunal shall not order the grant  of a new lease if the landlord undertakes to pcy to the tenant such compensation as the tribunal nay in the circumstances of the ease consider to be reasonable/&quot;.(3) v7here a landlord required to appear and give evidence before the tribunal refuses or neglects to do so, tho tribunal may assume that he has acted with such a view as aforesaid.(4) For the purpose of enabling a tenant to enter into negotiations with any superior landlord under this section,  it shall be the duty of the immediate landlord and. of any superior landlord on a request in writing from the tenant to furnish to the tenant information as to tho length of the term for which such landlord holds the premises and as to the name and address of his immediate Landlord, and if he fails to do so, he shall be guilty of an offence and liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding twenty pounds,(5) For the purposes of this section -The expression &quot;fair market rent&quot; in respect &quot;of a lease of any premises means the rent at which a willing lessor would lot tho premises to a willing lessee having regard to the terms of the lease, but irrespective of any goodwill which may have become attached to -the premises by reason of the tenant or his predecessor in title having carried on thereat a particular trade or business:The expression &quot;rent&quot; includes any premium, covenant to expend money on the premises,  or other consideration for a lease.The landlord shall be deemed to have refused to grant or to concur in granting a lease If on being requested so to do he has refused or failed to enter into negotia-tions for the grant of the lease, rch 86th,  19S7.
