IS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GG V1DRNMENT).cret CABINET. I   (--Memorandum by the Minister of Pensions on theproposals made in Memorandum CP. T&quot;07 (27&quot;Xby the Minister of Health regarding the cost of provision 61T medical treatment for uninsured war &quot;pens oners.I submit the following memorandum for the decision of the Cabinet.The Minister of Health has in his Memorandum made the novel proposal to transfer the coat of one of the National Health Insurance services from the Vote of the Ministry of Health to that of the Ministry of Pensions in ,order to meet a deficiency on another Insurance account. I feel bound to put before the Cabinet the objections which I see to this proposal.My objections are briefly:-(a) that the transfer is not justified because the service in question formed naturally a part of the Insurance scheme, was deliberately made a charge on that scheme by Statute in 1917,  and has so remained for ten years;(b) that,  as Minister of Pensions, I have no authority to take over a Health service which is outside my Statutory powers, and the transfer of which I could not justify on merits in Parliament;(c) that if I were to take It over, though the present cost is trifling, I should be Incurring risks of much heavier liabilities for the future finance of War Pensions.My reasons for these objections are:-(1 )     The service in question consists of the grant of free medical benefit (i.e., the services of a general practitioner for any and every ailment whether due to war service or not) to war pensioners who are not insured under the National Health Insurance Acts and whose income does not exceed  160 a year. It was only one of the many small concessions under the Insurance Schemes that were made to ex-service men of the Great War.       It was intended to benefit, primarily, men who had paid contributions as insured persons during their War Service, but who, on discharge from serviee reverted to or took up a non-insurable occupation (such as hawker or pedlar) and so lost the benefit of all their past contributions, and also a very small fraction of men who had definitely elected not to be insured during their service.      It was a concession in short, made in order to avoid trivial exceptions to a benefit which was generally available to ex-service men.    As such,  the charge for this benefit was placed upon the Navy and Army Insurance Fund by the National Health Insurance Act of 1917,  and lias been re-enacted without qualification by succeeding amendments of the Insurance Acts down to the last of them in 1924,      The Minister of Health&apos;s proposal would, therefore, on the face of It, be directly contrary to the express terms of those Acts.I should
I should obviously find it very awkward to explain the occurrence for the first time of this charge upon my Vote as a means of avoiding the failure of the Navy and Army Insurance Fund and the consequent stoppage of the additional benefits made available to its members.    I could not justify the charge upon any other ground because it is not incurred in respect of a liability that I have any power to meet.(2)    &quot;Medical Benefit&quot; Is in no sense a war pension charge and goes far boyend anything I can give.      The Ministry of Pensions is not (as might be inferred from the Minister of Health-3 Memorandum) being relieved by the Insurance Fund of the medical treatment of pensioners which it ought to provide.      Such occasional treatment (if any) for a war disability that practitioners under it can give is only a fraction of the &quot;Medical benefit&quot; services they render to their patients in the course of a twelve-month. Tho Ministry of Pensions on the other hand has only statutory powers to provide treatment for war disability3j and this treatment is for the most part treatmeht&quot; &quot;in a hospital or at a clinic,  and Is available for uninsured and insured alike.      It may be, and is, a convenience tu both the pensioner and the Ministry that the services of a know/n medical man should be always available  to supplement the special treatment given by the Ministry of Pensions. But this is equally true of both Insured and uninsured. If medical benefit for the uninsured were abolished to-morrow, the treatment of these pensicnex^s for their war disabilities could and would still be provided by my Department;    the only difference would be that in some cases I might have to find and arrange with a local general practitioner (as I do already in the case of men with incomes of more than  160 a year) instead of finding one alroady in charge of the patient.     It is true that the Treasury suggested some time ago that medical benefit for the uninsured should be terminated in favour of an arrangement for the treatment of war disabilities only, but after consultation with the Ministry of Health and my Department, they were convinced that for the present the existing scheme (and certain similar arrangements which I have been forced by the existence of the English Scheme to make in Ireland) should remain in operation on the ground that no economy to the Exchequer   would be secured by the change.      But the Treasury&apos;s objection to the existing scheme was on merits; they have never suggested that the scheme as it stands should be taken over by my Department and indeed have supported me in my objection to the present suggestion.(3)   If I am to assume liability for medical benefit in respect of one set of beneficiaries on the ground that, though un-insured and therefore not properly entitled to any benefits, they are war pensioners and ought to have them, I should be faced at once with claims for similar benefits from other classes&apos; of war pensioners, both officers and men, for whom &quot;medical benefit&quot; is not now provided by anybody, though treatment for their war disability is,  of course, provided by my Department.      The Minister of Health, as controlling the Health Insurance scheme,  ia in a position to keep within limits the number of ex-servic-e pensioners who are entitled to free medical benefit, though uninsured, because the whole arrangement is conditioned by the general insurance scheme;     but if I, as Minister of Pensions, bear the charge for this particular section on the ground suggested by the Minister of Health, It becomes a war pension charge, and I should have no answer to the pressure that would at once be brought to bear upon, me to extend the range of tha benefit,
(4)    In the interests of sound finance I feel bound to keep my rote clear of tho National Insurance Funds. I am, as the Cabinet will be well aware, constantly under pressure to extend my liabilities to cover a number of other cases and other conditions which can be s&amp;id to be more or less connected with war service,      I am, for example, pressed to meet hard cases of unemployment among disabled pensioners (insured as well as uninsured) by some modification of the Pension Warrants, which would relieve the Unemployment Insurance Funds.      Under similar pressure the Ministry in 1917 were induced to make an annual grant to Approved Societies under the Health Insurance Acts to cover the assumed extra cost of benefit given to disabled ex-service men on account of their war disabilities,  though fortunately the dangerous possibilities of this precedent were recognised and the heavy annual charge of nearly half a million for this purpose was brought to an end in 1920 by my predecessor, the present Secretary of State for War.       If the Minister of Health&apos;s present proposal Is sanctioned I see unanswerable demands for similar subsidies in other directions.(5)   The Minister of Health bases his proposal on the ground that he is faced with &quot;an actual shortage of cash immediately required to meet the dentists&apos; bills falling due for payment&quot;.        I venture to make two observations upon this.      In the first place, the &quot;shortage&quot; is not due to the cost of medical benefit to the uninsured because this was specifically included In the estimated liabilities of the Fund when the Economy Act of last year was passed. Secondly, the Minister of Health*s shortage, if I rightly understand the matter, arises primarily from the regulations, (S.R,  &amp; 0.   (1926) No. 1550,) which have placed the cost of these additional treatment benefits in a watertight compartment,      The expenditure on them in ary year is limited to the amount certified from time to time in advance by the Government Actuary as available for that year and that year only, and this amount is simply an assumed proportion of the whole (and much larger) amount ascertained on valuation to be available for a, period of years. The present Is the first year&apos;s working of the new benefits, and any advance estimate of its coat is likely to be wholly falsified by experience.      The Ministry of Pensions instituted a system of dental treatment necessitated by wo1 disabilities some years ago and experience showed that the expenditure of the first year was double that of the second.     The reason, of course, is that with the starting of any new scheme of the kind, arrears of old cases have to be made up, and it is only after the scheme has been in operation for some time that a normal level of cases is reached.     Is it not In fact premature to say that any actual cash shortage has occurred, except so far as it has been created by the Regulations?     These, however, are presumably not unalterable.G.C,  TRY ON. Minister of Pensions.Ministry of Pensions. 1st April, 1927.
