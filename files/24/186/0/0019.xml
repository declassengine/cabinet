Printed for the Cabinet, May, 1927.SECRET.Copt No.30CP. 120 (37).THE CABINET.THE EMPLOYMENT OF COMMUNISTS IN WAR DEPARTMENTESTABLISHMENTS.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY&quot; OF STATE FOR WAR.I am concerned at the employment of Communists in War Department Establish-      60 ments and in Naval Establishments in the vicinity thereof, especially those in the  Genera Woolwich Arsenal and Dockyard area.From this aspect Communists may be divided into two categories : (1) Persons   actively engaged  in  the dissemination of anti-constitutional  andrevolutionary propaganda, either oral or written. (2) Persons who merely label themselves as Communists, or profess an academicallegiance to the doctrines of Communism, without taking any active part inthe furtherance thereof.It is clear that, in dealing with this problem, all Departments of State responsible for establishments of a similar nature must act in concert, if action is to be effective..I hope that my colleagues will agree that the Government should adopt the following policy in regard to the persons in question, and that this policy should be carried out by the three Service Departments, and by other Departments in which active disloyalty would have scope for the infliction of material damage : Such persons as can be shown by reasonable evidence to come within category (1) above, should be discharged forthwith, and without pension or other superannuation benefit. No immediate action should be taken in regard to persons coming within category (2), but they should be eliminated as and when opportunity offers, i.e., by discharge onreduction.L. W.-E.10th May, 1927.(b27/17)   100   5/27   w.o.p.   3120
