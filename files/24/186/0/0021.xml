&apos; if.!THIS DOCUMENT IS TEE, PROPERTY OF HIS BKXTANNIO MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT,Oopy No.  30SECRET.&quot; CABINET.,P. 122(27)TRADE;OUTLOOK. Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.I circulate, for the information of my colleagues, reports which I have received from members of my Advisory Council on the trade position and trade prospects.This review is not as satisfactory as the one which I gave a month ago.   There has .been, if not a set back, at any rate a halt in the recovery of trade *    This is partly due to the strain of paying taxes in the last month and to anxiety about the Budget.   All trades emphasise the importance of a sustained attempt at economy in national and local finanoe.As regards particular industries, the big steel firms can see four months&apos; work aheadj beyond that they are uncertain.    I have some ground for hoping that some - -amalgamations may take place in.this industry.    The worsted trade is worse.    Cotton is better than before the strike, but orders are not coming forward as well as had been expected on the experience of the last two months * The coal trade   must be causing owners considerable anxiety. The position entirely bears out the view which I expressed to the Cabinet throughout the strike, that a settlement which greatly increased the potential output of the mines, while keeping every inefficient undertaking in existence, would lead to over-production and a slump in prices.    It is to be hoped that other industries may benefit by this position.Sir Arthur Balfour&apos;s report on his visit to Germany is interesting, particularly tho view expressed to him by
\German coal-owners and steel makers that our coal 3trlke had done them more good than two or three years hard work,I think a fair summary of the position would be that the feeling of optimism which was prevalent during the early months of this year is giving way to a feeling that there will be more trade to be done, but that we shall have to fight hard to secure it *P.C-L.1 ^ IdBoard of Trade,12th April,  1927.

COAL.SIB ADAM NIMMO wrote&quot;I do not feel that there is much that I can say in regard to the position of the Coal Trade at the moment as compared with the report that I made at the last meeting.&quot;The most recent figures of output shew that the output for the week ending 19th March is 99.6% of the average output of March 1926,  and it has fallen about ifa as compared with the output for the three weeks in February ending the 12th, 19th and 26th respectively.&quot;The potential output of the country is relatively high, but the difficulty is to secure a sufficient volume of trade to absorb the output that could be made available.&quot;Values of coal have been falling,  I think,  over the country as a whole,  and in certain of the distriots   mainly dependent upon export the fall in price has been substantial. Home industries ought to benefit considerably from the lower prices now ruling,  and they should be materially assisted in the movement towards expansion which may he said to be in evidence,  although perhaps not pronouncedly so in iron,  steel and shipbuilding.&quot;The tonnage of coal exported for -the month of February 1927, was 4,172,856 tons,  as compared with 4,092,879 tons for the month of January 1927,  and 4,70S, 536*&quot; tons for the month of March 1926.    Export trade is difficult to obtain.    This is particularly the case in the Baltic where British coal is finding itself in serious competition with Silesian coal. The conditions under which Silesian coal is being delivered in the Baltic are extremely difficult for British coal to L -meet.    The fact that Polish coal is unable in the meantime to find a market in   German territory is forcing that coal into all the Baltic markets,  and until there is some readjust-ment of the economic conditions that obtain as between Poland and Germany, the competition of Polish coal must remain a menace to the British coal trade in our Northern European markets in particular.    If anything oould be done to assist in spreading out the existing economic situation between Poland and Germany it would be of material advantage to British ooal,- V/ith the wages of Polish miners at something like 3/9 per ton,  and having regard to the fact that Polish coal is subsidised in respect of railway carriage from the collieries to the Baltic,  a problem is presented to the British coal trade which will not be    easy to solve.value of the coal exported during March 1927 is now available, d amounts to 4,819,912 tons.
COAL (Contd.).&quot;I may mention that the German railways have from April 1st reduced their rates on coal Carried from the Ruhr and Upper Silesia to Berlin in large capacity wagons by 20%,  the hew rate being approximately 10/- per ton as compared with 12/6 previously.&quot;If the American sti^ike continues some small benefit may accrue to British coal, but it appears to me that the present strike is not of sufficient magnitude to make any material difference in the uituation at least for a considerable time to come&quot;.STEEL.SIR A. BALFOUR considered that the worst feature of the present position was that now that blast furnaces had been got going,  and that the steel works were producing more, there was no doubt we were getting ahead of the demand. Everywhere billets were piling up in works where formerly they were short,  and the only things which the trade was now short of were certain special makes of billets or special carbons.    Unless a quiok demand arose,  it was clear that the big steel work3 would find a difficult time in front of them, in view of the capo,city for which they had been put into operation.The home turn-over was good.    Looking at the trade with all the engineers and shipbuilders throughout the country, March was the best month we had had for many months, - for many years in fact.    In South America ive were managing to hold our own,  in spite of French,  German and Belgian competition.    We were holding it very well.    The United States was a very difficult market; things were not by any means as good there as they had been;  the collection of accounts was beginning to be difficult - perhaps on account of the great extension of the instalment system in America, - and consequently we were not finding it easy to do trade there at all.    In high speed steels we could not  -do any business.    We had expected that,  in view of the very high tariff,  the price of high speed steel would rise, but it had done nothing of the kind.    Ford was to-day buying it at a lower figure than he ever did before,  even before the present tariff was put on.    A little business was being done with Hongkong,  but there was a great deal of chaos there, and one really did not know what one&apos;s book debts were worth.    Japan was a very poor customer..    Australia, New Zealand, Canada and India were all quite good;  a quite steady trade was proceeding with all those countries.It was becoming more and more evident every day that if we in this country wanted to do trade, we had to go and fetch it; it would not come to us.    We had to send out the best travellers we could train,  and keep them on the job all the time.
IRON AND STEEL.wJR. BOND confirmed, in respect of the iron and steel industry-generally, what Sir Arthur Balfour had said.     As he had reported a month ago, the production of pig iron and steel in the country was on quite a high level, higher than it had been twelve months ago.    it was a little difficult to be certain about the prospects of the heavy steel trade.   Orders were undoubtedly being overtaken more quickly than new orders were being received;   but a good many of the large undertakings were being very much pressed for delivery in respect of business which had been held up and. had accumulated during the strike.   Again, no doubt many would-be buyers had an Idea that prices must fall in due course,   meanwhile many of the big concerns could not deliver for a month or two yet. On the other hand,  coke prices were still very high, and a shortage of coke and its high price were holding up the sale of pig iron.     This was probably not due to the coke capacity being insufficient, because some of the coke ovens had not yet started operations since the Strike,  - particularly those ovens which were not attached to collieries but to steel works away from the collieries.   Some concession in railway rates,  if that were possible, would enable some of these coke ovens to start.    The supply of coking slick was being considerably affected by the difficulty which collieries were experiencing in working full time in some parts of the country;    they could not get rid of their large coal and were not producing slack.    The bright feature in the heavy steel trade was the increased activity of the shipyards.   One or two shipbuilders had been speaking optimistically about this  in the last few days,  but we should have no measure of the increased shipbuilding activity until Lloyds Register published the figures in a week or ten days&apos; time.The demand for Sheets was very quiet, and it was reported that there, was a considerable over-production in the United States.    The tinplate industry was quite actively&apos;&quot;employed.   The largest makers had orders on their books to cover three months1 output.   But both the tinplate and the sheet trade were being affected by the troubles in the Far East.There did not seem to be any prospect of the prices of iron and steel falling for several months, and the only possibility of prices falling depended on production being kept up.   Generally speaking,  the larger concerns engaged in the heavy steel industry had four months&apos; activity in sight.    The outlook was not no?? so promising as it had appeared at the last Council meeting, when it had seemed that the industry in general might lock forward to an active time lasting into the autumn.    The Imports of iron and steel continued to be heavy,    pig iron could be bought from abroad at about 7s/6d. a ton below the price at which it could be produced at home.    The real trouble,  of course, was the one of potential demand for iron and steel in the world as compared with the enormous capacity of production.    The production of pig iron in the world in 1913 had been less than it was  in 1925 or 192 6.
4 f&quot;idENGINEERING.MR. BROWNLIE recalled that at the Council meeting in February he gave some figures of unemployment among the members of the Amalgamated Engineering Union.   The figure for the end of January shewed that there were 5,152 less unem-ployed in the Union than at the end of December.   At the end of February, a further decrease of 2,944 had been shewn, and the latest figure, for the end of March, represented again a decrease of 1,707, which brought the total decrease in the Union unemployment figures since the beginning of the year to 9,803,  and the percentage of unemployment down from about 11 per cent at the end of 1926, to 8,06 per cent to-day.   This indicated, from the standpoint of the Union, an appreciable improvement in the general engineering industry, and it should be added that these figures related mostly to the Clyde area and- the north-east coast, which had suffered severely from unemployment during recent years.ELECTRICAL INDUSTRY.SIR PHILIP NASH wrote:-&quot;I have nothing new to report on behalf of the Electrical industry; the state of trade has not changed during the last month.   The home market is still poor, but shows just a small improvement,  and I think we can look forward to a gradual improvement until later in the year, when the market will become active.    I am assuming that there will be no additional burdens in the way of taxation, or 3 recurrence of labour troubles.&quot;The export market remains the same, and is good, though prices are bad.&quot;COTTON.COLONEL SEDDON BROWN reported that the Egyptian section of the cotton spinning industry was running full time.   The&apos; coarser portion of that Egyptian section was in rather an un-satisfactory position, but the fine was fairly favourably placed.    The American spinning section was very bad indeed.During the month of February good business had been booked, but unfortunately that business had fallen off, and also it was to be feared that some cf the business had turned out to be of a speculative nature.The New American Yarn Association had started operations with some attempt to control prices.   Their first effort had
COTTON (Contd. ).been to suggest to mills that they shoudd close for an extended period at Easter.    Whether they would be successful in controlling prices was not yet known, but there was the possibility that measures of that sort would put up the cost of production, whereas what was wanted in industry was a reduction of cost in every respect, especially in taxation. In the weaving section more looms were running than had been employed for some time.   They had no big order books, however, and unless trade improved very soon, some of them would have to stop again.Col. Seddon Brown had attended the Cotton Conference recently held in Egypt, and he thought that very good work had been done there.   The difficulties as to mixing the seed, and the deterioration in &quot;the quality of cotton which Egypt was growing, had been dealt with in great detail, and it was pleasing to be able to report that the Egyptian Government was making good strides in the right direction.    Whilst out in the East, both in Egypt and in the Balkans, he had been amazed at the evidences of the competition which our goods from England were receiving from Japan.    We knew that that competition had been there, but it was getting worse.   English cloths in Egypt,  in Syria,  in Greece, and elsewhere, were being supplanted by Japanese cloths produced under low rates of wages and long hours.    It was getting so bad that the old English marks, so well known to the natives,  were being dropped out of their vocabulary, and they talked in terms of Japanese marks.    These Japanese cloths were made out of fairly clean Indian cotton, and were now beginning to cut against our bleached cloths, because they were washed several times  - they were not bleached, but they wei^e good enough.SIR W, CLARE LEES wrote:-&quot;The position in regard to the Cotton trade has not continued during the month of March on so satisfactory a basis as was the case in the two  preceding months.&quot;India has filled her requirements by her purchases In January and February, and the rest of the world has not been very active.   The difficulties in China have almost eliminated that trade for the time being,    South America is responding to the lower level of prices very&apos; slowly;&quot;Nevertheless, machinery is undoubtedly better engaged-than it has been for some little time, and the general level of employment distinctly better, and this should be the case for the next month or two - having regard to the orders that have already been placed.&quot;
WOOL.COLONEL WILLEY thought that in the worsted trade there was not much change in employment as compared with a month ago.    Any change that had taken place would he rather in the direction of better employment at the combing end, the raw material end, and less employment in the weaving end.    The worsted trade was expecting rather a better demand for export,  particularly in yarns;    and increased buyixig from Germany was playing a material part in bringing that about.    The woollen trade was about the same, with a little improvement in the hosiery and carpet sections.The machinery employed in Germany seemed to be on the increase.    In France, the depression which had hit the industry when the rise in the franc stopped both buying and delivery of contracts,  in the    latter part of last year, was beginning to ease up,  and, from what information we could get, machinery was being employed again more in France, and a higher ratio of machinery operation was enabling them to deal somewhat more easily with the question of production costs.    But as regards their finished cloth, the impression among British manufacturers was that the depreciated currency advantage which France had had was beginning to disappear and was being replaced by intenser competition on a higher currency level from Germany.    Indeed, this competition from abroad was causing a great deal of perplexity in the minds of all firms in the industry.    This was probably the case also with the employees    unions as well;    they were very much puzzled, because they were cognizant of the fact that in the woOl textile trade the percentage increase of wages above the pre-war level was higher than in any of the other unsheltered trades,    with the exception - it was believed - of the leather trade;    and they were in some perplexity as to whether they could continue to insist on this relatively high standard of living.    It was rather interesting that only recently the annual report of a very large firm of woollen and. worsted manufacturers in Czecho-Slovakia had shown that they were suffering from exactly the same trouble as ourselves;    they were employed to about 60/b of their capacity,  and this meant that their production costs were rising so high that they were unable to export, in addition to the fact that they had to contend against tariff barriers put up against them everywhere.The manufacturing position in Bradford and district was very discouraging.    Colonel Willey understood, on enquiry,  that the Union of leaving Overlookers, which was really the key Union to the  Industry&apos;s prosperity, out of a membership of about 440 to 460 had 120 members unemployed, which,  in that class of high-grade highly skilled labour, was exceptional.    It was the largest proportion of unemployed that they had ever had in the history of their organisation.    Trie position was worse in this respect than a month ago.    On the whole, however,  there was not much variation, because any decrease of employment in the manufacturing end had been compensated for by increased employment in the combing end;    but it was the manufactured products which were being exported, and this was not advantageous to the country as a whole, because it was the wrong class of export.
ISOWOOL (control.).As to the wool textile position in general, it was interesting to find that after eighteen months of vei^y acute depression in the United States, as against prosperity in other industries, things were getting still worse in the wool textile trade, when it was expected that they might have got better,, and machinery employment was declining..   This appeared to serve as evidence that the world&apos;s budget was changing, and that a snialler proportion of its total expenditure was being spent on tax tries, lhat was true of the wealthiest country, and It was possibly reflected in some of the others.Colonel &quot;^illey desired to endorse the suggestion as to getting out figures showing trade tendencies,  such as Mr. Debenham had put forward (see section on General Trade); this would be useful to the wool textile trade as a whole.    It was difficult in this particular matter to get the trade to get up to the level of progress attained in other industries, but the&apos; proposal was receiving careful attention, although there was a division of opinion about it.MR. AYK.ROYD desired to confirm what Colonel Willey had said with regard to the    wool textile trade.    The combing industry as a whole was remarkably busy, but there was one feature which should be specially brought to notice:    Germany, instead of receiving our tops, of which we had usually sent them fairly large quantities in the past, was demanding matchings to comb from, and this meant that their machinery was kept running while ours was suffering in consequence.    Many of our traders had to consider whether they would, do trade of that kind or be entirely without the trade.    As they were comparatively short of business, however,   they would probably take what they could get.    As far as was known,  the position in the combing industry in Germany was now such that they had their machinery booked up for the whole of  the year, whereas we were very precariously employed. We ought to be at our maximum in the combing industry, because it was just the time of year when the whole of the clips of the world should be pouring into the v&apos;/est Riding, and should keep our machinery running.    It was rather a serious matter;    for,  corn-paring the present hours of employment with those in 1914, and, the fact that 150 per cent, more was being paid in wages now than in 1914,  taking into account the hours,  it could be realised that under conditions of that kind our traders could not compete with countries abroad.The spinning trade as a whole might be divided into two. Hie single yarn trade was much better than it had. been a year igo..    Germany was now taking our yarns, whereas she was not buying them twelve     months ago.    On the other hand,  the fine trade,  the merino trade, was in a precarious condition, largely owing to our high cost of production.    Mr. Aykroyd did not think that the situation in hosiery was satisfactory.    In manufacturing, the men1s wear trade was fairly good, but that in ladies&apos;  wear was not so.    The heavy woollen trade was very quiet and business generally was struggling hard.
WOOL ( C ONTD.)One further noticeable factor was that England no longer decided the price of the raw materials in the world&apos;s markets. For many years we had done so, but to-day we had to follow countries that were producing on a lower basis than we were.MR. ARTHUR SHAW wrote:-&quot;I am attending a meeting in Manchester to-morrow to deal with the General Wages Question in the Dyeing Trade, between the Allied Association of Bleachers, Dyers, Printers and Finishers, and the various Trade Unions. The meeting has been.convened at the request of the unions, and it would appear that there is a reasonable chance of arriving at a satisfactory settlement.&quot;Following my report of last month on the general situation, the improvement has been maintained in the Huddersfield District, and the last available figures for the week ending March 30th show that the number of persons signing the Vacant Book has decreased on the member shin from 8.13$ on February 23rd to 6.42/5.    The improvement appear^-to be general throughout the distriot.&quot;In the heavy woollen district, there has been a marked improvement in both Batley and Dewsbury, and the position at Yeadon is better to-day than at any period during the past, two years.   For the whole of the heavy woollen district, the percentage of unemployed signing the register has fallen from 19.79$ on February 23rd, 1927, to 14.72$.&quot;I regret to say that in the Bradford trade, the improve-ment has not been maintained, and from the middle of the month there has been a considerable increase in the number of persons on short time.   In particular, this applies to Bradford, where there has been an increase of over 50$ on the &apos; figures recorded for February 23rd.    This is also very marked in the Shipley district, where the trade is similar, the increase in the number of persons on short time being over 100$ over February 23rd.    On the other hand, in Keighley there has been a continued steady improvement.    Taking the Bradford district as a whole, which includes Keighley, the figures are:-   February 23rd, 7.47$; Maroh 30th, 10.4 6$.&quot;To complete the table, the total figures of persona signing the register are as follows:- February 23rd, 11.33$; March 30th,  10.41$.&quot;ARTIFICIAL SILK.MR. ADDISON wrote:-&quot;Having regard to general trade conditions, we consider the volume of business done so far this year is satisfactory.
U2ARTIFICIAL SILK (Contd.)&quot;During the last month there has been some improvement in the amount from Lancashire and Yorkshire veaving manu-facturers, but we can hardly say at the moment whether this is likely to continue or be merely &quot;a flash &quot;in the pan&quot;.&quot;The hosiery traae is very steady but the Leek and Macclesfield knitters still continue to be quiet and call for very poor quantities.Export Trade.&quot;On the whole this presents practically no change from the last report.&quot;In India business is difficult to put through owing to the very low prices which are offered, and in South America one has still to face the keenest competition from Bluropean producers who are prepared to accept any price.&quot;The general situation calls for no further comment&quot;.ChEMlUALS.MR. PERRY said that the situation in the chemical industry at the present time was unusually interesting.    The industry, during the bad time through which it had passed, had taken the opportunity to scrap redundant plant,  to concentrate production, and to apply co-operative measures more widely&apos;.    All these things were very much to the good from the technical and financial points of view, but from the profit side, the side of earning power, the picture was not so rosy.    The volume of trade generally was not anything like as large as had been hoped for, national and local taxation was still far too high from the trade point of view, and there was very severe continental competition.    The amalgamation of the four leading firms in the industry had all tended for the best and had consolidated the position;    no doubt considerable economies in production would be effected in the course of the next year or two.    This big undertaking,  the Imperial Chemical Industries, - represented about one-third of the whole capital employed in the British chemical industry, and therefore it might be described as strengthening very much the situation nationally, but by no means as overshadowing the position of the    industry as a whole.The Council were aware of the recent conversations that had taken place here with industrialists from Germany and from France, and to-morrow a further group from Italy was to meet here.      The representatives of Germany and Franoe chanced to include members of the chemical industry in those    countries,    and    the    opinion   was strongly held that whatever might arise definitely out of
CHEMICALS (Contd.)these Conferences was likely to arise through the channel of the chemical trade.    Lastly, the new draft French tariff showed a very coneider&amp;ble and serious expansion of duties. A number of modifications to lessen the disadvantages which this country would suffer under the Tariff, would probably be possible if negotiations took place between the two countries.    The President said that the question of making representations would be considered when all the British industries concerned had submitted their views.POTTERY.MR. HOLLINS reported that the position in the Pottery industry was very much the same as at the end of February when the previous report to the Council had been made.    There was a steady    improvement in unemployment figures, which were at least 15 per cent lower than at the corresponding period of last year.    There had been a steady fall each week of this year.    This did not mean that full time was now being worked; about four days a week was about  the average, and, generally speaking, it was Coming to be reoognised now that in the pottery trade a five-day week&apos; would be the normal full week in the making processes    - as this seemed to lend itself to better organisation   - and that these making processes should not be done on the short day, Saturday.There seemed to be a little pessimism amongst employers about the future outlook, but if we took the unemployment -figures, the indications were of a steady improvement. Probably, however, there would always be a sort of margin of unemployment.    There were five or six thousand who were not likely ever to be absorbed in the pottery industry, even in the best years.    There would be this permanent margin.    V7hilst there was a little pessimism, Mr. Rollins had learnt from a large export, factory recently that they were working at high pressure in order to cope with the large amount, of - orders they had in hand, and would be doing so for some time.    There appeared also to be some improvement in the hor^e trade, and we could regard the whole situation as very fair.    In the sanitary earthenware, fireclay, and tiles, it was exceptionally good; and also in the better class china which still maintained its high excellence.RUBBER.MR. JOHNSTON observed that the rubber manufacturing&apos;industry had nothing in general to report sinoe last month except that
4 p  1RUBBER (Contd.).there had been no improvement in trade reflected in the figures of turnover.    In the classes of poods most widely sold,  indications seemed to show that the spending power per head of the population had decreased rather than increased,  since the cessation of the strike, particularly in certain districts.    On the other hand,  in the mechanical rubber goods trade, which covered goods mostly supplied for engineering purposes and other industries,  there wore signs of greater activity,  and thin indicated that the general industrial activity of the country was slightly greater at the moment than it had been.    The tyre trade was busy but not at remunerative prices.    The imports of foreign tyres during the last month had been at the rate of  5,000,000 a year.    There were indications that, whilst, the motor trade was busy-, it was finding difficulty ih getting deliveries of motors taken,  and this suggested &quot;chat In the nest month or two it might not be favourably situated.    The rubber footwear trade was fairly active, but suffered from foreign competition.    Exports to the Dominions were good,  but to Continental countries poor. Unemployment in the trade was slightly less than it had been a month ago.FOOD INDUSTRIES.SIR S. MaCHTN remarked that there was now,   in these industries in particular,  increasing unemployment and a continuance of the depression which a month or two ago had seemed likely to disappear.    The reports of shortage of money appeared to be confirmed by the fact that there was an increased demand for cheapness, for cheaper goods;  and people were looking to save money by giving less regard to quality than they had done hitherto.    This,  of course, was not a very satisfactory state of things.GENERAL TRADE.SIR A. balfour said that  herebad been a decided falling off in trade all round in the last tl ree weeks or so, partly due to the situation in China,  no doubt, but probably also partly due to payment of taxes.    The payment of  taxee during the last six weeks had been a considerable strain on industrial concerns and individuals.    The percentage of bank loans to dej)03its was rising steadily;  it was somewhere about 57 per cent, now, which was higher than it should be.    It looked, however,  as if it might go higher still.
4 p 10 General TRADE (Contd.).MR CURRIE remarked that there was not much to report as to the London money market.    The rates remained very much the same.   The bill rate had been on an average 4-5/l6ths.    It would probably be higher but for the continental demand for bills.   The figures for these would show rather a decrease, which was natural at this time of year,   The percentage of advances had increased.    It was certainly higher than at this time last year,  and that was probably due also to the effects of the strike.    On the Stock Exchange there had been no violent fluctuations.   The market In Government securities had been very good.SIR S. MACHIN confirmed Sir Arthur Balfour1s report that the promise of the early months cf the year was not being fulfilled.   Both manufactuners and distributors were complain-being of a severe falling off in business.    Sir Arthur Balfour had alluded to the question of taxes as accounting for the shortage of money for the time being.    Great results had been expected from the Budget this year, but the last figures published had come  as a shocks   While traders did not perhaps mind one bad year, the shock was increased now by the fact that it was not at present possible to see how the position v/as going to be changed.    It was causing great uneasiness, and when the extraordinary difficulty of ever-increasing municipal expenditure had also to be faced, manufacturers felt they had a very very serious problem to deal with.   Until something was done to show them that the financial position was going to be definitely tackled, this want of confidence would continue, and the depression would be likely to increase.Our export trade, which a month or two ago had been more promising, was still keeping up, especially in the Dominions, but there v/as very little life in it, and it was not possible to see a prospect of any material increase unless developments took place which at present were not in sight, and did not seem likely to occur.MR. DEBENHAM reported that he was trying to ascertain whether the main distributing trade-organisations, wholesale and retail, would be willing to have their figures sent in to an accountant, and then transmitted,  as a whole, to the Board of Trade, for their information.   The President said that it would be extremely useful to be able to get a real reflection of purchasing power in that way.    It would be realised, of course, that the Minutes of these meetings were available only to the Cabinet and to the Dominion Prime Ministers, besides the Council members themselves.    They were therefore entirely confidential.Mr. Debenham thought it would meanwhile be useful to the Council to know that in the first three months of last year there had been a very marked improvement In the trade, both wholesale and retail.    This year the position in both directions, wholesale and retail, v/as roughly this, that the trade had lost about half the improvement they had; gained last year.     However, from
GENERAL TRADE (Coatd.).being paid in, there was no particular evidence of people having too little money.The fashion was still continuing, as he had mentioned at the last Council meeting, in favour of cotton and artificial silk goods as against silk or woollen.MR. HAYRTJRST had a gratifying report to give regarding the business of the Co-operative &apos;7holesale &quot;Society during the month of March.   A decrease in the sale value of coal was reported, though not to the extent which had been anticipated; and the coal market still remained in an unsettled state.    In tea there had been little change, and all.kinds could be quoted as steady.   There had been a good export demand for leaf teas -any good quality tea was continuing to be in request.   During several recent weeks larger parcels of coffee had been offered in London.   The new crops of East Indian coffee were generally of poor quality,   and slow of sale.     As to cocoa, the Americans were still busy in Accra, and had bought up the whole crop; the price had risen from about 44/- per cwt.., at which It stood last year, to 83/-.   But the new crop was in sight, and the American ring would have to unload or they would find themselves faced with a serious position, for there were other firms in this country situated like the Co-operative Wholesale, that is to say, they had a fair stock of cocoa already in hand that would last until the new crop came along.From the general standpoint one could not feel satisfied with the drapery trade.    Several of the mills in textiles, also, were calling for more trade, though it was gratifying to learn that during the last few months some of these works had reported satisfactory increases.   Taking the boot and shoe trade as a whole, one had reason to be satisfied with the -increase reported.   A strange thing appeared on turning to furniture, furnishing and hardware.   These were things which people would try to do without if they happened to be short of money, and it gave ground for encouragement when the fact was recorded that there were substantial increases in every section of these departments of business, which covered a multitudinous number of articles,  and sellers anticipated being able to main-tain satisfactory progress.   Reviewing the business  as a whole during the past month, there seemed to be no ground for feeling despondent.   The manufacturing and distributing sides seemed cheerful as to the future, and while increases were not anticipated immediately, there seemed to be a bright tone which would indicate that there was no falling off in purchasing power.There were other indications to the same effect.   The Co-operative Societies were concerned in banking also, and the peoplers savings were at a satisfactory figure.MR. VYLE considered that the general feeling of dis-apoointment expressed last meeting still prevailed.   The improvement in trade that had been looked forward to had not come in the volume that was expected.    The causes were really, difficult to define with any precision; but as to engineering, the heavy trades were not yet delivering a sufficient variety
GENERAL   TRADE    ( CONTD .)of materials for the engineering trades to work on.    There was a general feeling of uncertainty about    - probably due to the proximity of the Budget, which was always a disturbing matter, coupled with the high prices of some of the basic commodities.Leicestershire reported that the conditions in the boot and shoe trade had slightly improved, and in hosiery there was animation over the brighter prospects.    In Nottinghamshire one bright spot.seemed to be the lace curtain trade, which was now in its seasonal flourishing condition, and in lace itself there had been a slight improvement, but again not so much as was hoped for.    In the hosiery trade in Nottingham they reported very little improvement, and much short time was being worked.   In the making up trade in that district there was a distinct revival.  - so much so that they could not find sufficient skilled machinists to deal with it.    On the other hand, they complained that the Lancashire and Yorkshire dyers and printers were continuing to work short time in spite of a demand for goods they could not satisfy, and that deliveries of cloth which should in the ordinary course be made within fourteen days, could not be obtained under a minimum of from five to six weeks.SHIPPING.MR. ALEXANDER SHAW reported that the index number of shipping freights for March was not then ready, but freights during the month had slightly receded, indicating that&apos; the small improvement early in the year had been due, to a con-siderable extent, to business deferred during the coal strike, and did not represent a substantive advance.   Rather less tionnage was being taken up.   With regard to orders for new tonnage, the increased tonnage commenced in the quarter ending 3lst December would probably swell the figure of tonnage under construction during the quarter ending 31st March, 1927.   The latter figures had not yet come to hand. Regarding our coal exports, the improvement in the February figures compared with those for January was rather better than it looked.   There were only 24 working days in February, as compared with 26 in January.   The January figures had been 4,092,000 tons and the February figures 4,172,000 tons. Bunker coal was slightly cheaper than it had been a year ago. The continued high price, however, was said to be having a distinct effect in encouraging shipowners to build new tonnage adapted to be fired by oil or with Diesel engines.   As to laid-up tonnage a Note would be put in (it follows at the end of this paragraph).At their last annual meeting the Chamber of Shipping had passed a resolution which, among other things,  said this:-&quot;That all regulations affecting shipping, whether relating to matters intrinsically within the ecope of the Mercantile Marine Department of the Board of Trade, or any other Department
1 Q oSHIPPING (Contd.).of the Government, shall be issued by the former Department only&quot; - that is, by the Board of Trade.    If Acts of Parliament laid down that some regulations were to be made by other departments,  the shipping industry would submit, generally, that they should be altered; but there was something immediate ly in question which could be altered without any Act of Parliament.    It concerned the carriage of animals on the open decks between Ireland  and this country in winter.    On the 3rd December the shipping industry sent a deputation to the Ministry of Agriculture and promised to bring before them the opinions of those engaged in the cattle shipping industry. On the 20th December, while they were obtaining these opinions they received a letter from the Ministry of Agriculture saying the Ministry had definitely made up their mind and would not alter it.   That was before they had received any evidence from the shipping industry.    When the evidence came out It was found to be all in one direction, from those who shipped the cattle from Ireland and those who received them on this side.   These people considered that, in the interests of the health of the animals and of their being in a fresh condition, it was far better that they should be shipped on the open decks on that short sea voyage.   The shipping industry were informed that the Ministry of Agriculture were intending forth with to issue these regulations applying to the winter months, although the winter months had new gone.The President said he thought the Board were nearly always consulted about matters which affected trade.    He was not, however, conversant with the details of this particular matter, and would communicate with the Minister of AgricultureLAID-UP SHIPPING.Memorandum by the Chamber of Shipping.The question is sometimes asked whether the total of laid-up shipping shown in the Chamber of Shipping quarterly &apos; returns contained any tonnage which is permanently unemploy-able .It is impossible to answer the above question categori-cally.   A ship is unemployable or not according to the state of the market.   During the last few years many British ships have been unemployed, some for lengthy periods, but tramp, freights compared with pre-war were lower than the general level of wholesale prices.   This probably applies even to the later months of the Coal Strike,  as the earning of nominally high freights was accompanied by a very large increase in the cost of bunker coal, loading delays at American ports, and the necessity for bunkering abroad for the round voyage, thus shutting out homeward cargo and so reducing the earning capacity of the ship.During the last three years the number and net tonnage of British vessels laid up at the 36 United Kingdom ports

Jan.	1. . .	141	42,222	82	310,194	223	352,416At first sight, the figures in the table might    suggest that there is a total of some 300,000 net tons of British shipping which was unemployable at the costs and freights prevailing during the last three years.    There are, however, reasons for believing that the composition of the idle fleet varies considerably from one quarterly return to the next. The Annual Statement of Navigation and Shipping of the United Kingdom for 1924 contains a table - No. 21 on Page 79 - in which an account is given of the vessels included in the returns for the year 1924, of the vessels registered under Part I, of the Merchant Shipping Act 1894, but not included in the employment returns for that year.    It appears from that state-ment    that 238 trading vessels of 120,683 net tons (including 22 new vessels of 2,530 net tons) were unemployed for the whole of the year.    The Chamber of Shipping returns show that the average of the quarterly figures for the    year 1924 was 438,136 net tons.    The obvious conclusion is that, while many vessels were laid up for months at a time for lack of freight, most of them obtained employment for some part of the year.  In the 1925 Annual Statement the corresponding table is No. 20 on Page 63.    According to this table, 261 trading vessels of 81,872 net tons (including 31 new vessels of 10,171 net tons) were unemployed for the whole of the year 1Q25.    For this year the average of the Chamber of Shipping quarterly total was 539,425 net tons.In order to check the accuracy of this conclusion the Chamber of Shipping laid-up returns for the 1st July 1926 and the 1st October 1926 were analysed as far as possible in
CHAMBER OF SHIP?ING MEMORANDUM (Contd.)order to determine which of the vessels laid up on the 1st October were also laid up on the 1st July.    On the 1st July 508 British ships of 848,621 net tons vrere laid up.    On the 1st October the total had fallen to 302 ships of 354,805 net tons.    In the case of 7 of the ports making the returns (Glasgow and Gareloch, Leith, Middlesbrough, Goole, Falmouth and Hull)  the names of the actual vessels laid up were available.    At these ports 99 vessels of 191,478 net tons were laid up on the 1st July and. 61 vessels of 94,732 net tons on the 1st October, but only 24 vessels of 46,772 net. tons were common to the two returns.      In other words more than one-half of the vessels laid up on the 1st October, 1926, represented vessels which were trading oh the 1st July.An examination of the ages of the 24 vessels which, having been noted as laid up on the 1st July, were still so noted on the 1st October, did not Indicate any special preponderance of very old vessels.    Their age distribution was as follows:-.Of the 24 vessels, 10 were under 15 years old and 14 were 15 years and over In age.    Of the 61 British vessels laid up on the 1st October 1926, 22 were under 15 years of age and 39 were 15 years of age and over.We may conclude therefore that nearly the whole of the British tonnage recorded as laid up in the various quarterly returns was idle because cargoes were not available and not because it was unfit to carry cargoes except at a very high level of freights.MR. HILL stated that the improvement in railway receipts from goods traffic had continued.    Taking the five weeks ending 27th March, the receipts of the four main line companies from goods traffic exceeded those of the corresponding period of 1926 by  540,000.    It had, however, to be borne in mind that goods rates generally had been increased since 1st February by 6ir$.   During the first twelve weeks of the year, the receipts from goods traffic had exceeded those of the first twelve weeks, of last year by  890,000, but that improvement In receipts had been offset by a falling off in passenger receipts, so that the nett Increase in railway receipts from allUnder 5 years old.......5 and under 10 years old1 6 3 1 7 610 and under 15 15 and under 20 20 and under 2525 years    old and overRAILWAY TRAFFIC.
i rJ &apos;RAILWAY TRAFFIC (Gontd.)traffic carried in the twelve weeks was only  26,000.    At the same time, in considering these comparisons with last year it should be remembered that the receipts from goods traffic on the railways in the first twelve weeks of 1926 had shown a considerable increase over those for the same period in the previous year,  1925.    The increase in the receipts from goods had been  507,000, and from all traffic,  484,000; and the further increase in the first twelve weeks of 1927 over the    corresponding receipts in 1926 was satisfactory, particularly as the    figures showed a continuing tendency to a progressive rise in receipts from goods traffic.With regard to the tonnage conveyed by the railways, the latest figures available were for the month of January, and  they indicated that, as compared with January, 1926, there had been a reduction in tonnage conveyed of 12,500 tons or about . 1$.    This reduction had been chiefly under the head of &quot;Other Minerals&quot;, which were less by .9$,  and coal, coke and patent fuel, which were .1$ less.    With regard to selected traffics, there was not much to say.    The most striking figure was that in regard to iron and steel. There had been in January an increase in traffic of about 200,000 tons as oompared with January, 1926.    That repre-sented an increase of about 15.3$.    Against trls, however, there had to be set reduced tonnages of Ironstone and ore, which were less by 270,000 tons or 32.3$, and of pig iron, which were less by 24,000 tons or 7.6$.      Presumably the raw material had been accumulating during the coal strike when there had been a cessation of smelting, which might account for the reduction in the amount of raw material conveyed for some little time after the strike had terminatedEMPLOYMENT.MR.  PHILLIPS observed that, as the Council were aware, the unemployment figures had fallen week by week during March until the 21st, when they reached a total of 1,078,500,  or about 39,000 more than a year ago.    In the following week there had been unfortunately a small nett increase of about 3,000.,  That increase was perhaps not quite so bad as might appear, because the number wholly unemployed actually fell by 18,000.    But there was at the same time an increase of temporary stoppages amounting to 21,000, and this appeared to have occurred principally among coal miners in the Midlands, where thene was said to be a good deal of short time owing to lack of orders.    On making a comparison with the figures of a year ago, it was    found that the number of persons wholly unemployed was actually less now than then, and the nett increase, which was about 70,000, was due to temporary stoppages, mainly - as already stated - in coal mining. Mr. Phillips handed in a table (which follows) showing  the distribution of unemployment, district by district, on the 4th April, as compared with the end of April last year.

1 .j dSlit A. BALFOUR had been to Germany recently and had had an opportunity of meeting many of the big industrialists both in the Berlin and Cologne districts, particularly people in the Steel Cartel, Krupp von Bohlen and others.    They told, him that the coal strike in Great Britain had done them more good than two or three years hard work could have done. They had been very short of liquid capital,  even the biggest of them, and the seventy millions paid by us in cash for coal had given them some money to turn over quickly,  it had put them on their feet,  given them encouragement, and had enormously helped their export   trade in general, quite apart from the coal exports.    Their railways had also been short of cash, and these railways had taken eight million pounds for transport of coal to Great Britain alone.In Berlin Sir Arthur had met some members of the Government, and it seemed as if they were going to have further legislation in regard to Cartels and combines,  of a rather drastic character.    They did not think they would be able to avoid having a measure to the general effect that anyone,  - not merely a person generally interested,  or a consumer, but even a trade competitor,  - oould demand an enquiry before a special court into the workings of combines and their effects and so on.   As to hours of labour, they were working any hours they liked.    Sir A. iBalfcur was mooting a great deal of competition in Belgium from German steel works and he recently made inquiries to Q30.-how. the Germans were doing it and quoting such low prices .    The particular works in Germany where inquiry was made proved to be working two twelve-hour shifts, and wero producing enormously on a very large scale.   After seeing their works, and the way the people were working,  it could quite well be understood how they were able to quote the prices they did, those px&apos;ices being about 25 per cent, below the British level. Some of the great German industrialists said that they had no intention of binding themselves to an eight hour1 day or any other day.    In the fixing of hours they were to be perfectly free to work as suited them best, and try to get back their position.    Wages were rising in Germany, and that was about the only direction in which we could look for any alleviation of the competition from them.   As regards savings, they were saving very hard and living frugally.Sir A. Balfour had gone also to Denmark, but not very much wa3 being done in Denmark.    There had been an amalgamatioi of a big shipbuilding concern with a big dock concern and these people were busy doing an immense amount of ship repair work at,  ao they said, remunerative priooa.   3ritish ships were being brought in there for repairs.MR. AYKR.OYD referred to Sir Arthur Balfour&apos;s mention of Germany being willing to work any hours in the iron and steel trades, and said that there was no doubt that the Germans were working vory much longer hours than we were, in the textile trades also.   We were mo3t anxious to maintain our standard of Jiving hero, but it was only by a very great struggle that we could do it.
The Russians had set up an organisation in Bradford and were buying there considerably.    It appeared that a large percentage of that business was being done on the &quot;basis of cash before delivery;  this was partly in yarns,  but mainly in raw materials.    There seemed also to be a tendency to grant them small credits, largely because, of the inability to get trade elsewhere,  and risks were being taken that should not be taken.The President said that it appeared,  then,  that the Russians were paying cash for raw material and asking for credits in the case of manufactured articles.    If they paid cash,  this tended to show that they were competing with other people who were also Intending to buy,  but that in other cases they played off one country against another and invited credit.    He had been told of an instance where Germany had offered four years credit to the Russians,  and the Russians were now visiting Italy and saying that the orders could be placed there if they would give six years credit.    That kind of thing could go on almost indefinitely.    The practical course, when money was very short,  appeared to be for the people who competed for these orders in the different countries to agree that whilst they would tender on a competitive basis there should be some limit to the length of credit which they would give to the Russians, who were the least likely of all people to pay.Sir Arthur Balfour considered that British business men ought to have arranged these Russian credits thro ugh one central organisation,  so that they could all know from time to time how the matter stood,  as had been done in Germany. Probably it was too late to do it now.    These things&apos; were getting into a state of chaos,  and seme day we might be astounded at the amount of money owing to us from Russia.Mr. Hayhurst agreed that it would be well for British traders to help one another by making some arrangement whereby information could be available as to the credits which had been given to Russia.    At the same time,  so far as the Co-operative Wholesale Society was concerned,  every obliga-tion that the Russians had incurred up to the present, had been met.COLONEL SEDDON BROWN had been interested to hear what Sir Arthur Balfour said about hours in Germany.    he could confirm this, but it might also be of interest to know that within the last few weeks he had been in various cotton mills in Greece.    He believed he was right in saying that Greece had ratified the Washington Convention, but all those mills were working 10 hours a day, or 58 per \week,  and business men in this oountry were rather alarmed at the prospect which opened up.
JR. BRAND reported that in the United States money remained quite easy, and looked- as if it was likely to be easy in the future.    Of course they had imported a good deal of gold, which had helped them.    It was understood that the United States Government were just carrying through a conversion scheme of a large-scale issue - for five or six years - 5%/&apos; notes, with which they were going to buy up a lot of Liberty Bonds.    They were said to estimate that they would make a saving in interest of 25 million dollars a year on the operation;    it looked, therefore, as if money was likely to remain easy for some time. America continued, of course, to pour out money throughout the world.    She had rather changed now from Germany - Germany was more or less saturated, - to Central Europe and South America, and It was quite clear that even if we could supply the money at all, New York could do so cheaper.    There was an instance a few days ago which was striking.    They issued something like 50 million dollars of City of Tokio in New York at 8&quot;9^or 89g-. The same funds were standing here at 85, with about 1% added, and if the 2% stamp was deducted here, as against nothing in New York, any English concerns competing would find 7 points difference between what the Americans would have paid and what we could pay.   As an instance of how much the Americans wer.e lending, they had made a loan to the Republic of Colombia - Tiot the State Government, but to departments and agricultural, banks and so forth, - of 40 million dollars this year, and now Colombia was prepared to borrow 20 million dollars more on terms of about 7 or 7l/t.In Europe money rates were inclining upwards.   There, did not seem to be any sign of easier money here.    It would be slightly easier when tax collection was over, but, on the.,o-ther-hand, it looked as if we would have to send more gold to India, and probably to Prance.    In Germany money was easier, but monthly money was running now at 5* to 7 per cent.   Not so much foreign money was going into Germany, and they had an excess of imports over exports.    In Switzerland there was a slight hardening of money rates following on the German rise, and in Holland also.    In Prance money was cheaper, and there had been a very distinct rise in all French securities - not Government securities - in the last two or three months.   As regards the foreign exchanges, of course the main improvement had been in the Italian lira, perhaps due partly to the amount of American money going into Germany and into Italy.   Rome had made a big issue, and Milan was going to make a big issue.   All the representatives of American   houses that had been .in Germany were now in Italy ready to lend money there.    In Spain there was a considerable improvement In the exchange.   Apparently it was due to a large bull speculation starting in Amsterdam.In conclusion, Mr. Brand desired to apply to what one might call foreign bankers in London the maxim which Sir Arthur Balfour had applied to commerce (see Section on Iron and Steel), namely,  that they were not now In the position in which they had been before the war, when London was entirely the financial

So far as capitalwas concerned London was far behind New York.AUSTRALIAN TRADE,,MR. SANDERSON observed that the wool and wheat season was practically over in Australia.   The hopes of genei^al monsoonal rains had not yet been realised, and there was anxiety among pastoral interests, especially in central and south western Queensland and western Now South Wales,  in regard to the lambing which was expected this month and next, and in regard to the disposal of surplus sheep in New South V-!wales.A feature of recent months had been the ainalgamation of some banking interests, and the issue of fresh capital by some of the pastoral companies to provide for increased demands for money.     New secondary industries were still being started, and attention was being directed to a more profitable use of the brown coal deposits which were situated mainly in Victoria.It was too soon yet to speak of wheat prospects for next season;    and reference had been made at a previous Council meeting to the serious shortage of apples in Victoria and South Australia.     It might be of interest in that connection to note that the first shipment of Australian apples this season had reached Hull on the previous -vionday by the &quot;FERNDALE&quot;, and were due to arrive in London on the following Friday .INDIAN TRAD ,ivIR. LINDSAY stated that the crop position in India was only partially satisfactory.    The bulk of the crops fell into two olasses - those harvested in the autumn, like rice and jute, and those harvested now, in the spring, like wheat and oil seeds.     The rice and jute crops had been fairly plentiful; the wheat orop was deoidedly under par, and of the oil seeds we had not received full particulars yet, but it was feared that they were rather under par also.     For that reason exports from India had tended to fall off somewhat in February, and probably the falling off would be found to have continued in march, with the result that the busy season for the Indian export trade would have been rather shorter this year than usual.     The cotton orop had been distinctly short, and one evidence of that would be found in India?s purchases of
INDIAN TRADE (Oontd.).American cottujj., which had increased from 1,100 bales In 1925 to 49,000 in 1926, showing that the^e had been in 1926 a distinct shortage of Indian cotton.   Further, as Mr. Lindsay-had explained at the Council meeting last month, the margin between American and Indian cotton prices had fallen, and American cotton was now very attractive to the Indian spinner.The imports of cotton piece goods had increased in 1926 as compared with 1925, and there must have been a further increase of such orders in January and February 1927, but whether these orders were going to be maintained or not at the higher level was very doubtful.   Inquiries made in Manchester tended to show that the volume of orders in the first two months of the year had not, in fact, since been kept up.   The imports into India of cotton yarn also had increased from 49-g- million lbs. weight in 1925 to 5lf million lbs. in 1926.   Further, the proportion of this trade&quot;done by the United kingdom had increased and t^at from Japan had decreased, in a comparison of the yoar 1926 with 1925.    (A Table showing these figures is given at the end of this paragraph).   At one time practically all this cotton trado wa3 in the hands of British spinners.The imports of iron and steel goods had Increased materially, from 787,000 tons in 1925 to 945,000 tons in 1926, and the inorease was striking whon it wag remembered that in the category of iron and steel Imports into India the protected imports were to the unprotected as 4 to 1. The exports of pig iron from India had dropped from 400,000 tons in 1925 to 315,000 tons in 1926, but in spite of that Japan had increased her purchases from 158,000 to 231,000 tons.   It should be noted in regard to the trade of India with Japan how very much more the Japanese bought from India than they sold to India.    They imported from India good-, chiefly raw cotton and pig iron, to the value of 30 millions, whilst their exports to India, ohiofly of cotton piece goods, amounted in value to 12 millions; so that there was an export trade from India to Japan of 2-g- times the value of the import trade from Japan.Imports into India.1925. 1926.Million lbs.15i 2131-1- 2849-1 5lfMillion yds..1,366 1,469201 2321,616 1,762(from United Kingdom.

1r/ ?I ! OSOUTH AMERICAN TRADE.MR. HOSE observed that the Council night be interested in certain aspects of present-day politics in Chile.    It looked on the face of it as though there were an autocracy there of an objectionable character, because of the large number of persons who had been deported or requested to deport themselves, but this did not appear to be the actual fact.    It was true that Colonel Ibanez, who was in charge, had matters completely in his hands, but his history was good, and he had always dealt fairly with the people when he was in positions not so high as his present one.   He was faced, moreover, with considerable difficulty in treating with many of the responsible officers of the Republic. His Government had also effected a remarkable step in having taken a number of those who professed communistic opinions and shipped them to an island 400 miles away.    It was said that they had offered them materiale for building their homes and seeds for growing crops, in order that they might try their own system of life and government for themselves.As regards the export tax on nitrate, it had been pointed out to the Chilean liovernnent that if they took into account the taxes that they raised on the materials used in the production of the nitrate, they could abolish the whole of tlie tax on the exported nitrate and yet be in pocket if they exported 3 million tons, which they easily could in that case do.    But they considered that there were difficulties in the way;  and no action in that direction had yet been taken.In the Argentine everything was going well.    They were assured of a bumper crop.    The wheat had been reaped a couple of months ago,  and maize wa3 certain,  the exchange had responded,  and it might be taken that Argentina was extremely prosperous.    The announcement had recently been made that restrictions on imports of Argentine meat into the United States were to be withdrawn.    In raising the embargo,  the United States Administration had undoubtedly been influenced by the rising feeling in Latin American countries against the growth of American politico-financial influence.    There was every indication that Great Britain was first among the countries with which the Argentine Government hoped to enlarge the scope of commercial air1 economic co-operation.In Brazil there was not so much prosperity, but it would be appropriate to mention that there were projects there involving the purchase of materials, particularly electrical materials and iron and steel,  and Mr. Hose would be glad to give particulars of some that were already in hand to any British firms likely to be interested.    As to Peru we could say nothing particularly favourable, because cotton and sugar were their two principal products,  and these were not at good prices at the present time.
TRADE IN CHINA.MR. LANDALE said it was very difficult to report on business in China in present ciroumstances.    In Hongkong and the South, until a few weeks ago, there had been a distinct improvement, but recent telegrams were not bo hopeful.    In Shanghai there was, of course, a good deal of labour trouble, and it was impossible to say from day to day what the position would be.    The Yangtsze ports were practically closed.    In Hankow many native merchants had been ruined by the extortions made upon them by the Cantonese Government.   They had been made to subscribe heavily to National Bonds, and to pay large sums to rescue relatives from imprisonment.    The Cantonese Government were proving no more honest than Chinese Governments of the past; for instance, in the South, In the districts where the Salt Inspectors had been suspended, it was found that only about one-half of the salt revenue had been collected.    The suooess of the Northern Military Governors was not desired by the native bankers and merchants, though no doubt they would welcome a oompromise which-would eliminate the extremists on either side.   Mr. Landale had always held the opinion that the Chinese were incapable of making peace among themselves, and some assistance from outside must be given them.    It was really a peacemaker that was required.    In Tientsin and the north there was a nervous feeling which was making business difficult.    A member of an American engineering firm who was in this country just now had said he had been doing a large business with China lately. Possibly that meant that he had been selling steel and other things for munitions.British shipping was doing fairly well in the south, but it was very much restricted elsewhere.    As regards the railways the northern line from Peking to Mukden had been doing well* but the Tientsin-Pukow Railway was entirely in the hands of the military.   The Shanghai-Nanking line and the Shanghai-Ningpo line had been much interfered with of late, but a restricted train service was now being tried.

B.D.I.E.JLOOSTATEMENT by the five delegates from Great Britain and Northern Ireland to the International Economic Conference to be held at Geneva, - handed in by Sir Arthur Balfour, who Is one of the delegates.GPEAT BRITAIN AND THE WORLD ECONOMIC SITUATION.1.     The Chairman of the Economic Conference has invited the members to supply concise summary statements not aiming at a description of the national situation, but indicating briefly how the national economy of their respective countries at the present time is related to the world economic situation.   The following is an attempt on the part of the delegates from Great Britain and Northern Ireland to comply with the Chairman&apos;s Invitation.2.     The National Economy of Great Britain* does not aim at self-sufficiency.     Any such ideal has been abandoned for more than a century and ever since the prosperity of Great Britain has been intimately bound up with the progress of the world&apos;s international commerce, which is estimated to have increased in volume fourfold in the forty years prior to the outbreak of war.It is, therefore, not surprising that, in spite of the comparative abundance of capital, and the relative stability in our monetary system, this country has suffered severely from the check to international commerce that has been caused by the war and its aftermath.At the present time Great Britain is more dependent than any other great commercial country on its export trade to enable it to supply the needs of its economic life.    Just before the War no less than 30 per cent, of the total industrial production of Great Britain was exported, and though the proportion is now somewhat lower it is probably not less than a quarter.Prom the standpoint of Great britain a recovery of British exports is essential.     Such a recovery is dependent, however, upon the prosperity of the world generally.    It is, therefore, to the interest of Great Britain to further the economic recovery of the world so far as lies in her power.3.      On the other hand the recovery of British exports is also a necessary condition for world prosperity.    In 192 5 Great Britain imported one-fifth of the total exports of all other countries - a far larger proportion than any other single country.     When Britain is buying freely, favourable repercussions are felt in every continent - our supplies being drawn in about equal proportions from Europe, from the British Empire, and from other extra - European countries.      Our purchases are likely to increase with the absorption of our- Here and afterwards in this statement the expression &quot;Great Britain&quot; is used to refer to Great Britain and Northern Ireland.
Great Britain and International Trade.ish 5.     Just before the war Eritish exports formed 13 per cent,irts of the total exports of the world.      On an .average of the years for id        1924 and 1925 (1926 is excluded as abnormal on account of the prolonged Coal stoppage) the percentage was about 12%.    But thoughwthe proportion of world trade which falls to our share has not materially declined,  it must be remembered that the total volume cf world trade has itself considerably fallen off, so that (measured by pre-war. standards of value) our exports of goods are probably not more than 80 per cent, of their amount before the war.The slight fall in our Proportion of trade is not in itself unexpected, for the development of the more distant parts of the world has meant that for the last fifty years or so Britain&apos;s proportion of world international commerce has been falling. :c-&quot;e have, however, maintained our position rather better than Europe as a whole, the greater headway having been made chiefly by the countries of the New ^orld and of the Par East.As will be seen from the te.ble annexed hereto, the proportion of our exports consisting of manufactured goods remarkable ins ab out t h re e -truart e rs .6.     As regards the direction of British, exports the situation maybe analysed as follows:-   Carrparing the quinquennium before the war with the two years 1924 and 192 5 the proportion of our exports sold to the countries of the British Empire rose from 35.4 per cent, to 38.5 per cent.     The sales of Great Britain to the countries of the British Empire were however a smaller proportion of the total pur-chases of those countries than before the war.Foreign countries in Europe, which took 34.6 per cent, of our exports before the war, took only 32 per cent,  in 1924-25., But the proportion of total imports of European countries which came from Great Britain remained about the same as before the war.      If our exports to Europe are unsatisfactory, it is not so much due to our being ousted by the goods of competing nations as t o a lack of buying power in European to the endeavour of European countries to supply their own requirements with the aid of protective measures.unemployed and with a renewed advance in the standard of living in Britain.     But this is unlikely to happen for a long time to come unless we can achieve full employment in our staple industries which in its turn means that our exports must expand.     We can only continue to buy on the same scale if we have the opportunity of selling freely.Moreover, the lending as well as the buying power of Great Britain is similarly dependent upon the recovery of her exports.4.     The above statement sums up in a few lines the economic relation of Great britain to the world generally.    It may be of interest, horever, to consider in a little more detail how the general economic situation of this country has changed since the period immediately preceding the war.
nee.Eprt ofSes.1913.......:.1923.........1924.........1925.........The balance for 1926 is even larger, but a comparison based on that year is vitiated by the seven months&apos; coal dispute.This enormous balance is still covered by &quot;invisible&quot; items in our international trading account, which for 1925 were roughly estimated by the Board of Trade at  449 millions against  339 millions in 1913 (chief items - Shipping earnings  124 millions against  94 millions, and interest on oversea investments  250 millions against  210 millions ).   But whereas the 1913 figure yielded a surplus^ of  180 millions available for investment overseas in excess of investments by foreigners in Great Britain, the corresponding surplus for 1925 was only a little more than  50 millions, and in the abnormal year 1926 the surplus altogether disappeared.8. -  The above figures make it quite clear that the large issues of capital every year for foreign and colonial borrowers on the London market have recently not been made entirely out of our own resources, but have been rendered possible through the influx in various forms of capital from abroad.     This movement cannot be expected to continue indefinitely, and though in the abnormal circumstances of the past two or three years we have maintained a high level of imports in spite of reduced exports, it is certain that unless we can sell our products more freely abroad we cannot continue to buy from abroad on the present scale, nor can foreign borrowers effect the same facilities from the London Capital Market.9.      It is, of course, very relevant to inquire whether Britair is selling goods at prices which can compete in world markets. Official calculations show that in 1925 the level of the import price index number was 53 per cent, above the level oftfAfter allowing for the movement of bullion and specie and the unrecorded value of imported diamonds.IllFinally, the rest of the world, which before the war took 30 per cent, of our exports, took 29.5 per cent, in 1924-25,7.     Eut while the volume of our exports of merchandise has fallen when account is taken of the change in prices, our imports have recovered to more than the pre-war volume.    In money value imports have nearly doubled, while exports have barely increased by one-half.     The result has been a very great increase in the (so-called) adverse balance of trade which, as the following figures show, has arisen from  134 millions in 1913 to  394 millions in 1925,(Million  )Imports.

1913.   The export price index number,  on the other hand, was 85 per cent, above the 1913 level.     A greater rise in average export than In average import values is common, however, to the post-war statistics of a great many countries, part of the explanation being that, whereas export values are values in the producing country, imports include freight - a service which of late years has been sold at extremely low prices, and in many cases at actually less than the pre-war level.    In respect of shipping, at all events, British labour and capital has been at the world&apos;s service on very favourable terms. Further there is ground for the belief that we are exporting in a greater proportion than before the war the higher and more expensive kinds and qualities of goods.Nor have all prices risen to a similar extent.     The price of raw cotton for example by 192 5 had doubled since before the war and this commodity (in the form of cotton goods) forms a very large item in our export trade.     The increased value of the raw cotton on the other hand constitutes only a smaller proportion of our much larger imports,&quot;While it may be proper to attribute some weight to the difficulty in reducing labour and other costs in a country which has raised the value of its money and lowered prices generally, the main explanation of the decline of our export trade is to be sought for in general causes rather than in circumstances peculiar to Great britain.Jort 10,   The effect of the shrinkage of world trade f oil owing the&quot;*es and   war has been felt with special acuteness in Great Britain, .ploy-    not because the proportionate reduction of exports has been above the average, but because production for export plays such an exceptionally important part in the National Economy. Hence the decline in exports has been largely responsible for the prolonged and abnormal unemployment of the post-war period, the rate of which (even apart from the temporary , effects of the Coal Stoppage) is considerably more than double that which prevailed before the war.Its effects are very clearly seen in the figures of unemployment for five large industrial groups, viz., coal, iron   and steel, cotton, wool, and engineering Including ship-building.    Unemployment in these trades is dominated by the export situation.     These five industries between them accounted for more than half the numbers unemployed in the month preceding the temporary coal subsidy (July 1925).      Out of 3,700,000 insured workpeople in these trades 705,000 vrere unemployed (i.e., 19 per cent. ), as compared with slightly under 700,000 unemployed out of 7,800,000 insured workpeople in all other occupations (i.e., 9 per cent.)0     Most of these industries are affected by special influences such as the effect of fuel economy, oil and water power on the demand for coal, the rise of the textile industries of far Eastern countries, the influence of the lack of capital on the world&apos;s demand for the products of the iron and steel industry and the excessive! Production of ships as the result of the war.     The situation cannot, however, be entirely explained by such considerations. Indeed, though these trades from their size are largely responsible for our excessive unemployment, other miscellaneous export trades are in greater or less degree similarly depressed. In 1910-1913 these five groups accounted for 56 it per cent, of our total exports.      In 1924-25 they still accounted for 55i

Of this increased population a somewhat smaller proportion than before the war is within working ages, but between 1913 and 1925 the numbers &quot;occupied&quot; (whether in actual employment at the moment or not ) rose from 18.7 millions to 20.3 millions, an increase of over 8 per cent.13.    So far as can be judged from statistics the total volume of industrial production in Great Britain is roughly the same as before the war, but meanwhile the population has largely increased.     Production per head of those actually employed (though not of the total population) has been maintained roughly at its pre-war level, any falling off owing to the 10 per cent, reduction of hours being on the whole (though by no means in every trade) compensated by improved methods and efficiency-&quot;-.The progress in British industry is often overlooked owing to the fact that the very scanty statistics of production which are continuously available in Great Britain almost all relate to depressed industries. .   The fact is that in almost all industries, including some of those which are most depressed, there has been a very extensive re-equipment of plant and modernisation of methodsAs indicated in paragraph make it perfectly clear that a main cause of unemployment.10 above, the deficiency ofstat ist ics exports isthe14.    In 1925 there was a general setback in the summer and increased unemployment, but even during that year many industries made continuous progress and at the end of the year, apart from the coal industry, the numbers at work were probably equal to those employed at the beginning of the year.     During the   spring of 1926 there was a considerable re -absorption of the unemployed and the indications all pointed to the probability that production would at last rise well over the level of 1913.     The recovery was undoubtedly assisted to some extent by the subsidy to the coal Industry, but the improvement was greater and more general than could be accounted for by this cause.*This does not apply to the exceptional year 1926 in which industrial-production was seriously reduced by the coal stoppage (see paragraph 14).per cent.      It is, therefore, clear that the exports of other trades had suffered almost as greatly as our major exports.11.   The restriction in the volume of our export trades has not been accompanied by a corresponding restriction of the general economic activity of the country as a whole; but taken in conjunction with Internal difficulties, some of them peculiar to Great Britain, some of them shared with other nations, it is responsible for a checking of the rate of our material progress which is in striking contrast to the rapid headway we were making before the war.    The general internal situation is briefly summarised in the following paragraphs.
i 0 &quot;*P burden        17.   This general survey has certain satisfactory features. rietp.pl oy-     It shows a&quot;&quot;marked recovery from the severe slump 7hichfollowed the post-war boom of 1920, when the productivity dropped to a level which is variously estimated at between 70 and 80 per cent,  of the pre-war production, and the numbers of the unemployed rose to over 2 millions in the winter of 1921-2.     The recovery has, horever, for various reasons been much slower since 1924, and we are still left with a volume of unemployment which is considerably more than double the numbers normally out of work before the war. For more than six years the numbers unemployed have never dropped, except for two or three weeks, below a million. This has constituted an economic problem comparable in gravity to that of dealing with the devastated areas of France or the complete collapse of the currency in Germany, and apparently as difficult to solve.     Its financial consequences are serious; the loss of acquired skill by adult workers and&apos; the failure to train sufficient numbers of the rising generation are among the economic consequences, while serious&quot; soc ial evils must inevitably follow from the involuntary idleness of large numbers of active adultworkpe ople .The improvement was, however, completely stopped by the coal dispute which is estimated to have reduced industrial production during its seven months&apos; duration by at least 15 per cent.The process of recovery has now been resumed and at the moment of writing it would appear that, apart from the coal industry which has not yet re-absorbed its full complement of workers, the numbers unemployed have been reduced to about the same figure as at this time last year.ndard 15.   There seems little doubt that as compared with the&quot;Livine.        pre-war situation the standard of living of the masses of the people during the years since the war has been main -tained -- possibly it has improved.     This opinion is founded on statistics of the consumption of common c om.mori.ities,  on wage statistics and on general observation. The view is endorsed by the surveys issued by the Committee on Industry and Trade (the &quot;half our Committee&quot;) and by the report of the Committee on National Debt and Taxation (the &quot;C olwyn Committee&apos; ).      Indeed, the two facts that the wages of unskilled workers have risen more than those of skilled workers and that families are smaller than before the war mean that there is actually less acute poverty.fring. 16.    It f oilows that with a larger population whose standardof consumption has been maintained the volume of goods and services directly consumed has increased; but as the total productivity of the country is practically stationary there must have been a smaller margin for savings.   The savings of the country in 1924 have been estimated at figures varying from  400 to  500 millions, as compared with  380 -  400 millions in 1913.      In other words, the proportion of the total income of the country which is set aside has fallen from 16 per cent, before the war to about 12 per cent, in recent years.   Allowing for the rise in the general level of prices the equivalent of our pre-war savings would be about  6 00 -  6 50 millions instead of something less than  500 millions.      The deficiency in savings has chiefly affected our export of capital which has been greatly reduced.

Some of the conditions of World Economy which contributed to the deep depression of British industry and commerce that followed the post war boom of 1919-20 have since been removed or mitigated.    For example, the outstanding difficulty of the post-war period has been the instability of &quot;currencies and exchange.     The restoration of a stable monetary basis for international trade was necessarily the first objective of British economic policy, and on the whole exchange difficulties are now a much less formidable obstacle to interrational trade than a few years ago.20.   But as monetary fluctuations have subsided the influence of other obstacles to commerce has become more apparent. Many temporary forms of obstruction have been introduced since the war, such as prohibitions or licences, and although these have been to a considerable extent removed, they remain a serious impediment.     Moreover, international trade still has to face the obstruction of numerous and often high tariffs.      This is true equally of foreign and of Eritish Empire markets.     With very few exceptions tariffs both in Europe and elsewhere are higher, and in some cases very substantially higher, than before the War.    The documentation on this subject generally shows also that these tariffs are becoming increasingly complex and nhat they are frequently changed,  often without reasonable notice, and that the process of reaching something like normal stability by means of commercial treaties has made little headway.      Tariffs clearly constitute a serious obstacle to the restoration of a normal volume of foreign trade.Meanwhile the Eritish market for imported goods not only remains much the largest in the world,- but is still Practically a free market.     It is true that, since the war certain new Customs duties have been imposed, e.g., to protect &quot;Key Industries&quot;, or to counteract abnormal conditions of competition resulting from unstable exchange or unfavourable conditions,  or for other purposes.    But the whole of the goods liable to these new duties only amount to two or three per cent,  of Eritish imports, and the fact remains that the overwhelming mass of imported goods at present enter British ports either free of duty&quot; or subject only to a revenue duty of a non-protective character.   The only substantial prohibition concerns dye stuffs, which are regarded as a &quot;Key&quot; industry of vital national importance.of21.    In so far as the recovery of Eritish export trade depends on increased industrial efficiency and reduction costs it is of course   a question of purely national concern
March, 1927.ANNEX.Percentage of Manufactured Exports to Total Exports.The table shaving the percentage of the imports and exports of various countries which consists of manufactured articles, printed on pages 156-157 of Volume 1 of the League of Nations Memorandum on Balance of Payments and Foreign Trade Balances, 1911-1925, does not include any figures for Great Britain and Northern Ireland.      It may, therefore, be -of interest to give below the percentages of the exports of this country and the other three principal exporting, countries which in 1913, 1924 and 1925 consisted of manufactures.    In making this calculation the British Board of Trade have taken &quot;manufactures&quot; in the sense of the Brussels Convention Classification and have excluded crude metals and refined mineral oils.     The figures for othr;r countries than Graat Britain agree generally but not precisely with those given in the League of Nations statement above referred to.Percentage of Manufactured Exports _ to Total Exports,_-1913.1924.1925.United Kingdom. . , United States of . America ........Germany........,France ..........Total of abov9.All countries75.831.5 66.6 60.858.535.173.932. 5 79.8 59.953.235.776.235.7 75.3 59.358.035.4The figures for the United Kingdom in 1924 and 1925 relate to the trade of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The figure for the United   Kingdom in 1913 would probably be reduced to about 75.0 if limited to the trade of Great britain and Northern Ireland.But in so far as it depends on the removal of artificial trade barriers it is a matter of international interest, since nothing but the restoration of our export trade can enable us to continue to afford to the rest of the world an expanding market for their Products.
