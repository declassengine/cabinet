Printed for the Committee of Imperial Defence.   April 1927.SECRET. C.O.S. 76.(Also C.I.D. Paper No. 789-B and CP. 125 (27).)COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE.Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee.CHINA :  SITUATION AT CANTON.Report by the Chiefs of Staff.1. WE wish to draw the attention of the Prime Minister and the Committee of Imperial Defence to a despatch dated the 17th January, 1927, from the Acting. Consul-General at Canton, which has been circulated to the Committee of Imperial Defence as C.I.D. Paper No. 786-B.2. In effect, this report throws some doubt on (a) the advisability and (&amp;) the feasibility of holding on to the Concession at Shameen. We therefore took the opportunity of our meeting on the 8th April, which was attended by Mr. Mounsey, of the Foreign Office, and Sir Gilbert Grindle and Mr. Clutterbuck, of the Colonial Office, to review our previous recommendations on this subject in the light of the views and information contained in Mr. Brenan&apos;s despatch.3. The advisability of holding Shameen is primarily a political question, with which we, as a Committee, are not concerned. We, therefore, confine our remarks on this aspect of the question to the observation that, if it be adjudged inadvisable, or even unnecessary, to hold Shameen, the fighting services will thereby be relieved of a considerable military commitment. On the other hand, it is possible that a withdrawal from Shameen might to some extent diminish our power to overawe Canton itself-the original headquarters and mainspring of the Nationalist Campaign, on which the Acting Consul-General (in paragraph 3 of his despatch) lays some stress.4. With regard to the feasibility of defending Shameen, our previous recom-mendations on the subject (C.I.D. Papers Nos. 759-B* and 762-B*) were based on the views of the authorities on the spot that the Concession could be defended. Mr. Brenan&apos;s despatch appears to cast some doubt on the correctness of these views, as is shown from the following extract from his report: &quot; 5. To return to Shameen, although, owing to the fact that it is an island, it could probably be held against a mob, or perhaps even for some time against a military attack, it is clear that if the Nationalist Government are deter-mined to resume control over the concession area they could, by more peaceful means, speedily make our continued possession of the island impossible, or at least unprofitable. It would not be difficult to reimpose the boycott and blockade of Shameen in a more stringent form than before. The electric light, which is derived from a Chinese company in the city, could be cut off. This was not done during the recent troubles, and although there is an emergency dynamo in the concession, I am told that it would only be sufficient for street lighting. The island has its own waterworks, but a few shots through the water-tower would put it out of commission and we should be reduced to drinking boiled river water, which, near Shameen, is practically liquid sewage.

whereas, during the last boycott, British subjects were permitted to move freely about the city and were so enabled by surreptitious means to do a certain amount of business, it could be made dangerous for them to leave the shelter of the island, and their trade would then really come to an end. All this could be done without any overt act on the part of the Canton Government, who would, as before, assert that they were unable to suppress a patriotic manifesta-tion of national feeling. A mob attack repulsed with bloodshed would almost certainly bring about such a state of affairs.&quot;5. We were informed that Mr. Brenan&apos;s despatch, from which the foregoing passage is quoted, had been communicated to the Governor of Hong Kong, but it was not clear whether it has been seen by the local naval and military authorities. We, therefore, considered that it would be advisable to draw their attention to it and to enquire -whether its substance led them in any -way to modify the views which they had previously expressed as to the defence of Shameen.6. With this suggestion the representatives of the Colonial Office and Foreign Office concurred, and we accordingly arranged for a telegram in the sense of the draft attached (Appendix I), to be addressed to the Governor of Hong Kong and to be repeated to&apos;the Consul-General at Canton and to Sir Miles Lampson at Peking.7. The reply (Appendix II.) to this telegram shows that the Governor of Hong Kong, the General Officer Commanding, and the Senior Naval Officer have not altered their opinion that the defence of Shameen, which is now garrisoned, is practicable, and that it should not be evacuated.The Governor of Hong Kong also points out that the views expressed by the Consul-General in his despatch (C.I.D. Paper No. 786-B) were modified by a telegram of the 21st January to the Foreign Office (Appendix III) in which we note that the following sentence occurs :  &quot;In the light of Foreign Office telegram No. 49 I should like to modify view expressed in my despatch and recommend that control of concession be retained until satisfactory and final agreement is reached with Nationalist Government and situation is again normal.&quot;8. In the circumstances we see no reason to depart from the recommendations contained in paragraph 15 of our previous Report (C.O.S. 62, also C.I.D. No. 762-B), to the effect that the men on the spot should have full discretion to hold Shameen as long as they consider possible with the forces available, nor to modify the instnic-tions issued to the local authorities at Hong Kong when these recommendations were approved.(Signed) BEATTY.G. F. MILNE.H. TRENCHARD.2, Whitehall Gardens, S. W. 1, A-pril 8, 1927.
APPENDIX I.Draft Telegram to Governor of Hong Kong.THE instructions issued to General Officer Commanding and Commodore, Hong Kong, and to the Consul-General, Canton, regarding the holding of Shameen (F.O. telegram to Sir Miles Lampson, No. 49* and Colonial Office telegram to Governor of Hong Kong, No. 32 (27) )* were based largely on the advice of the local naval and military authorities, dated the 13th January (G.O.C., Hong Kong to War Office, No. 1279,t and Acting British Consul-General, Canton, No. 51). We have recently received Mr. Brenan&apos;s despatch No. 8$ to Peking, dated the 17th January, which throws doubt on feasibility of holding Shameefn We should be glad to know whether you yourself, G.O.C. and Senior Naval Officer have modified your opinions in consequence of this despatch.* Not printed. t Printed as Appendix I to CCS. 60.* Printed as Appendix II to C.O.S. 60. 5 C.I.D. Paper 786-B.APPENDIX II.Decipher Telegram from the Governor of Hong Kong, dated April 9, 1927.ADDRESSED to Secretary of State for Colonies. Repeated to Peking; telegram No. 30 Canton.   Your telegram of 8th April* : Defence of Shameen.Brenan&apos;s despatch of 17th January! was modified by his telegram to the Foreign Office, No. 71, of 21st January, and the whole situation has completely changed since then, owing to the arrival of Shanghai Defence Force.Neither I, General-Officer-Commanding nor Senior Naval Officer have modified our opinion that defence of Shameen is practicable, and that Shameen, which is now garrisoned, should not be evacuated. On the contrary, if Shameen were attacked, we consider that warlike retaliatory measures should at once be taken, and that for this purpose adequate military forces should be kept at Hong Kong.General Luard, Admiral Boyle and Commodore Pearson concur in this message.* Printed as Appendix to C.O.S. 76. t C.I.D. Paper No. 786-B.\ Reproduced as Appendix to O.O.S. 77.APPENDIX III.Decypher Telegram from the Acting British Consul-General (Canton), No. 8,dated January 21, 1927.ADDRESSED to Peking, No. 13.Your telegram No. 70* and my telegram to Foreign Office No. 7.* My despatch! was written on receipt of Foreign Office telegram No. 1* to me and before receipt of Foreign Office telegram No. 49* to you, when it appeared that His Majesty&apos;s Government were prepared to allow Canton Government to go any length rather than take warlike action. I pointed out that in such circumstances Canton authorities could if they wished make continued possession of concession impossible either by repeated direct mob and military attack or by reimposing boycott and blockade of Shameen and this in a more stringent form. Therefore it was better to negotiate voluntarily rendition as it would be easier to stipulate for necessary safeguards while still in possession than after evacuation.Not reproduced.t O.I.D. Paper No. 786-ii.
Although British concession contains valuable property, its administration is very simple, and there are no public services beyond police force of thirty-three persons, a few municipal scavangers, &amp;c, and five waterworks mechanics. Provided question of Crown leases can be satisfactorily settled, chief danger of reversion to Chinese control are : (a) Misappropriation of concession funds. To guard against this there should be adequate foreign representation in municipal government. (&amp;) Excessive taxation on property. In the city heavy and increasing taxes are imposed on land and house property. I am told that Chinese manage to evade these to some extent by native methods, but foreigners would find that difficult, and it would be desirable to have a definite understanding regarding taxation in concession area, at least for a term of years, (c) Mob violence in time of trouble. At present this is very serious consideration, and if His Majesty&apos;s Government are prepared in the last resort to take vigorous measures against Canton the concession does provide valuable refuge for foreigners and also base of attack against city. In the light of Foreign Office telegram No, 4911 should like to modify view expressed in my despatch and recommend that control of concession be retained until satisfactory and final agreement is reached with Nationalist Government and situation is again normal.If the Powers or His Majesty&apos;s Government are finally forced into hostilities with Nationalists, Canton is their most vulnerable spot.(Repeated to Foreign Office, No. 8; Tokyo; Shanghai; Mr. 0&apos;Malley.)I Not reproduced.
