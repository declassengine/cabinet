Paper No. 795-B and CP. 138 (27).)COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE.Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee.THE SITUATION IN CHINA, APRIL 29, 1927.   SANCTIONS at hankow.Fourth Report by the Chiefs of Staff.AT the last Meeting of the Cabinet we were instructed to consider further the question of the practicability of holding the British Concession at Hankow during the period of low water. We have not only studied this question, but we are also in a position, as the result of a detailed enquiry, to report further on the. whole of the proposed operations at Hankow. In making this Report, we also have taken into consideration all the latest information on the subject.2. From the various telegrams to and from the Far East we. note that co-opera-tion by other Governments in the application of sanctions is becoming more remote, and we have therefore considered the question mainly from the point of view of action by Great Britain alone. We further note that there is general agreement in principle, by all concerned that Hankow is the right place at which action should be taken to put pressure on the Cantonese. Government. This is the view of the Naval Commander-in-chief, the British Minister at Peking, the Consul-General at Shanghai, and has been accepted in principle by the Cabinet itself. There is, however, some difference of opinion as to what form the pressure should take. The Naval Commander-in-Chief, who is supported by the General Officer Commanding the Shanghai Defence Force and the Consul-General at Shanghai, strongly presses for the reoccupation of the Concession. The British Minister at Peking is prepared to agree at once to the proposed reoccupation of the Concession rather than to see nothing done at Hankow, though he very greatly prefers the. destruction of the Hanyang Arsenal (Telegram No. 791 of the 27th April, 1927). We presume that the Cabinet will wish to be advised on the military aspects of these alternative, pro-posals a question which is dealt with later in this Report.Possible Immediate Action.3. The detailed examination which we have made of the proposal to reoccupy the British Concession at Hankow confirms us in the opinion expressed by the Chief of the Naval Staff on our behalf at the last Meeting of the Cabinet in favour ot the original proposals of the Naval Commander-in-Chief on the understanding that the two Battalions (which were the only purely military force then contemplated) should be regarded as landing-parties used in the same manner as Marines.4. Judged by normal military standards, the proposed operation would be hazardous on account of the dangers inherent in the very exposed line of communica-tion and of the fact that the Concession is dominated from the surrounding country, and that artillery established on hills on the right bank of the river could, if suitably handled, make the Concession untenable. The Chinese Army, however falls below the normal standard, and this factor can be assessed only in the light of local knowledge and local experience. It is evident that the local Naval and Military [16075] B
authorities, who support this operation, must be satisfied that these risks may rightly be accepted. We consider, therefore, that until the end of November the line of communications of the force at Hankow with the sea can be maintained and the Concession can be held.5. If the reoccupation of the Concession is undertaken we consider that no preliminary warning should be given, since this would enable the Chinese forces to prepare resistance and render it a more formidable and expensive operation. The embarkation of the necessary forces at Shanghai will itself give sufficient warning to the Hankow Government.6. Up to now we have been dealing with the Naval Commander-in-Chief&apos;s original project, which we had already recommended to the Cabinet as feasible from a military point of view. Since the last Meeting of the Cabinet, however, a telegram has been received from the Naval Commander-in-Chief (No. 1015 of the 27th April) reporting that he has received deputations from the British Chamber of Commerce representing that the decision to afford protection at Hankow only to British property in the British Concession in case of emergency there would expose British property outside the limits of our Concession to the risk of destruction, such property being ten times as valuable as that within the limits. As the result, the Naval Commander-in-Chief, in consultation with the General Officer Commanding, has suggested that protection should be provided for the bulk of these properties at the same time as the Concession is reoccupied. This involves an increase of the military forces up to three Infantry Battalions in addition to a Battalion of Royal Marines, four Battalions in all, as well as a Section of Armoured Cars and one Battery of Artillery (G. O. C. Shanghai Defence Force, telegram of the 28th April, 1927).7. In our Third Report (C.I.D. Paper No. 794-B*) we laid stress on the importance of using, as far as possible, Naval forces for the reoccupation of the Concession, owing to the possibility that we might later have to withdraw. We emphasised that the withdrawal of Naval forces would involve less loss of &quot; face &quot; than that of a military expedition. We recommended that any troops with which it was necessary to reinforce Naval landing-parties should be regarded in the same light as Marines. The Chief of the Naval Staff, at the Meeting of the Cabinet on the 27th April, reiterated that we recommended the proposals of the Naval Commander-in-Chief &quot; on the understanding that the two Battalions embarked from the Shanghai Defence Force should be regarded as landing-parties used in the same manner as Marines.&quot; The withdrawal of the larger force now contemplated by the Naval Commander-in-Chief and the General Officer Commanding would not only involve loss of prestige, but would be a more formidable operation at low river. The occupation of the British properties also involves increased tactical dispersion at Hankow. For these reasons we cannot accept the larger operation contemplated by the Naval Commander-in-Chief and the General Officer Commanding,- and our positive recommendation is confined to Admiral Sir Reginald Tyrwhitfs original proposal involving the use of only two Battalions over and above Naval landing-parties.The Hanyang Arsenal.8. We have examined in detail, so far as the information at our disposal permits, the project for the destruction of the Hanyang Arsenal, some particulars of which are given in the Appendix. From this it will be seen that any plans for the destruction of the Arsenal must take into consideration (a) the possibility of causing damage to the Japanese Hanyang Iron and Steel Works, (b) the danger of causing considerable loss of life in the densely populated areas of Hanyang and Hankow -Cities, and (c) the measure of resistance which is likely to be encountered.9.   Three methods could be employed to put the Arsenal out of action, viz. :-(i.)  Deliberate destruction by means of a landing-party; (ii.) Bombardment from the River; (iii.) Bombardment from the air.Of the above, destruction by means of a landing-party is likely to be the most effective, while the other two methods can only be relied upon to cause damage and not total destruction.   Further, only by resort to a landing-party can the possibility,* CP. 131 (27).
of damaging the Japanese works and of causing considerable loss of life to the Chinese inhabitants be absolutely obviated. The extent of the resistance to a landing is impossible to estimate.  O010. In a previous Report (C.I.D. Paper No. 792-B) we were opposed to the destruction of the Arsenal at Hankow as a measure of sanction, on the ground that this action might antagonise the various forces hostile to the extremist faction at Hankow, more particularly as those forces would probably be counting on obtaining the use of the Arsenal sooner or later. The attention of the Naval Commander-in-Chief has been drawn to this consideration, and we notice that he now wishes to keep the destruction of the Arsenal in reserve as a possible reprisal for resistance to the reoccupation of the Concession (Commander-in-Chief&apos;s Telegram No. 1015 of the 27th April).11. Whether the destruction of the Hanyang Arsenal would result in antagonising the whole of China, involving a great increase in the risk to our long line of communications by the river, and other consequences such as the reimposition of the boycott, or not, we cannot doubt that the adoption of this course would cause great resentment locally. It would probably lead to reprisals against British property at Hankow, including the British Concession. Further, if adopted as a preliminary to the reoccupation of the Concession, it would provoke the preparation of resistance and increase our difficulties. Hence, although we regard the destruction, or partial destruction, of the Arsenal as a feasible military operation, we think that, unless the men on the spot consider it necessary as a military measure to hamper any opposition to our original reoccupation or subsequent retention of the Concession, it should be kept in reserve for the present.The Position during the Period of Low River.12. As the result of a detailed study of the question, we have ascertained that all cruisers other than H.M.S. &quot; Hawkins &quot; and H.M.S. &quot;Vindictive &quot; can proceed as far as Wuhu at any time of the year. Gunboats can reach Hankow at any time, but Destroyers and Sloops are normally unable to do so during the period of low river  viz., the 30th November to the 26th March. We understand, however, that in the opinion of the Rear-Admiral, Yangtse, Destroyers could in an emergency be sufficiently lightened to steam or be towed from Hankow down river, except perhaps for one month (unspecified) in the winter.13. From a military point of view one of the difficulties in maintaining communications with Hankow during the period of low river is that the actual fall &apos; varies from 14 feet at Wuhu to 45 feet at Hankow; consequently, the guns of the ships could not be brought to bear on the forts or on field guns concealed in the vicinity on account of the height of the river banks. In such circumstances landings with a view to the destruction of defences would meet with exceptional difficulties, owing to the lack of covering-fire and the long stretches of muddy foreshore which might be encountered. We are aware that the Naval Commander-in-Chief has expressed the view that communications can be maintained, but we feel bound to warn the Cabinet that if the banks of the river are held by forces actively hostile, it might be impossible to maintain the communications. It is not possible for us to state definitely that the communications can be maintained after the 30th November./ Summary of Conclusions and Recommendations..14.   Our Conclusions and Recommendations may be summarised as follows :  (1.) From a military point of view the reoccupation of the British Concession at Hankow by Naval forces, supplemented by two Battalions from the Shanghai Defence Force, is a feasible operation,  and we adhere to our opinion that the two Battalions should be regarded as landing-parties to be used in the same manner as Marines. (2.) We do not recommend the scheme proposed by the Naval Commander-in-Chief (telegram No. 1015) and the General Officer Commanding Shanghai Defence Force (telegram of the 28th April) for giving protection in addition to British property outside the Concession, involving the use of a total of four Battalions as well as Armoured Cars and field guns.  The 116075] b 2
withdrawal of these large forces in case of necessity would involve loss of &quot; face,&quot; and would increase the military difficulties of evacuation. &quot;We are strongly opposed to the dispersion of force involved, and to so large a military commitment.(3.) We recommend that, if the reoccupation of the Concession is undertaken, there should be no preliminary warning other than that inevitably involved in the embarkation of the necessary forces at Shanghai and their transportation to Hankow.(4.) We consider that until the end of November the line of communications of the force at Hankow with the sea can be maintained.(5.) Judged by ordinary military standards the above operations would be hazardous, owing to the long and exposed line of communications and to the fact that the British Concession at Hankow can be dominated by artillery established in adjacent hills, but the Chinese Army falls below the normal standard, and we assume that the local Naval and Military authorities, who support this operation and who are in the best position to judge, are satisfied that the risks can be accepted.(6.) The destruction, or partial destruction, of the Hanyang Arsenal is, in our opinion, a feasible military operation. It might, however, antagonise the various forces hostile to the extremist faction at Hankow and so increase our difficulties. In any event it would outrage local opinion at Hankow and might lead to reprisals against British property and the preparation of resistance to the re-occupation of the Concession. We consider, therefore, that, unless it is required as a military measure in connection with the re-occupation or subsequent retention of the Conces-sion, the destruction of the Arsenal should be kept in reserve for the present.(7.) In view of the great fall of the water-level at low water (the 30th November to the 26th March), which varies from 14 feet at Wuhu to 45 feet at Hankow, the small craft which alone can navigate the river above Wuhu during that period will encounter great difficulty in dealing with forts and guns on the other side of the steep banks. In these circumstances, apart from the risks referred to in conclusion (5), we cannot guarantee that communications with Hankow can be kept open during the months referred to.(Signed) BEATTY.G. F.

The Hanyang Arsenal.The Hanyang Arsenal covers 10 acres of ground on the right bank of the Han River, by which it is separated from Hankow city itself. Adjoining the Arsenal are the Hanyang Iron and Steel Works, which are owned by the Hanyehping Company. There are considerable Japanese financial interests in the Hanyehping Company.The Hanyang Arsenal has been occupied by the Cantonese since September 1926. Since that date no information has been received as to the condition and output of the Arsenal.The older machinery of the Arsenal is Krupp, mostly supplemented in recent years from the Shanghai Arsenal, though some American machinery has also been purchased. About 5,000 men are normally employed in the Arsenal and in the adjacent Smokeless Powder Factory. The normal output, capable of great increase under pressure, is : -200 Rifles (Mauser pattern) per day. 200 Bayonets per day. 20 Mauser pistols.5 Machine Guns (Maxim pattern) per month.Rifle ammunition about 3  million rounds per month.1 Mountain Gun per month.12 Small Guns per month.The Hanyang Powder Factory is believed to be capable of producing 1,000 lbs. of Smokeless Powder per day.
