Printed for the Cabinet.   April 1927.SECRET. Copy No.   30CP. 117 (27).CABINET.BOUNDARY BETWEEN NORTHERN IRELAND AND THE IRISHFREE STATE.(Jurisdiction over Lough Foyle.)Circulated by the Secretary of State for Home Affairs and the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs.LOUGH FOYLE is an inlet of the sea, approximately 2 miles wide at its mouth, 8 miles wide at its greatest breadth and 15 miles in length, lying between County Donegal in the Irish Free State and County Londonderry in Northern Ireland. A rough sketch map is attached (enclosure 1), from which it will be seen that the navigable passage from the sea to the City of Londonderry lies nearer to the Donegal than to the Londonderry side of the Lough.The existence of a difference of opinion between the two Irish Governments with regard to the jurisdiction over the waters of Lough Foyle first came to the notice of the British Government in 1923, when arrangements for the administration of fisheries in Northern Ireland were being made by the Imperial Secretary to the Governor. The Government of Northern Ireland then intimated that they laid claim to the whole of the Lough up to high-water mark on the Donegal side. The basis for the claim was a Charter of the Irish Society, whereby the whole of the lands and waters granted to the Society (which undoubtedly included the whole of Lough Foyle) were constituted for ever one entire county, distinct and separate to all intents and purposes, and in as ample a manner and form as any other county whatsoever. The Government of Northern Ireland contended that Lough Foyle was included in the Parliamentary County of Londonderry for the purposes of the definition of Northern Ireland in the Government of Ireland Act.Towards the end of the year a case was submitted by the Irish Branch of the Home Office to the Law Officers, in which they were asked advice whether Lough Foyle is to be deemed in Northern Ireland or in the Irish Free State, or partly in one and partly in the other, and, in the latter event, what is to be deemed the dividing-line. Having regard to the political situation in connection with the boundary, the Law Officers deferred giving an opinion. The Government of the Irish Free State had not been asked to state their views, but it was known that they did not accept the Northern Ireland claim, and that if it were pressed they would put forward a counter claim not only to the whole of Lough Foyle, but also to the whole of the territorial waters adjoining the coast of Northern Ireland. The basis for this counter-claim (which we do not understand they were prepared to press unless the Northern Irish claim were pressed against them) was that inasmuch as under the Treaty the whole of Ireland was constituted the Irish Free State, with the exception of the six &quot; Parliamentary counties &quot; named in the Act of 1920, and as, in their opinion, the term &quot;Parliamentary county&quot; cannot be held to include territorial waters,* nor sheets of water lying between two counties, such as Lough Foyle, therefore not only the whole of Lough Foyle, but also the whole&apos; of the territorial wraters adjoining Ireland were within the jurisdiction of the Irish Free State.We understand that in the course of the boundary negotiations in November 1925 Sir James Craig (as he then was), in a private conversation with Mr. Cosgrave* N.B. This view was contradicted by the Attorney-General in the Debates on the Irish Free Stale (Consequential Provisions) Bill.[15958] . b   .
at Chequers, raised this question; but the only evidence on record of what took place consists in a draft clause of very limited effect,* together with a note by Sir John Anderson (who was present at Chequers, but not at the actual conversation between&apos; Sir James Craig and Mr. Cosgrave) to the effect that he understood that it was agreed to drop the question for the present and settle it by direct negotiation later.So far as we are aware, the general question was not again raised between the two Governments, nor was it mentioned by either of them to the British Government until a month ago. It is understood, however, that in order to safeguard the fisheries during the season of 1926, a temporary modus vivendi was reached between the respective fishery authorities, the details of which are not known.On the 8th March last Lord Craigavon sent to Mr. Cosgrave a letter, of which a copy is attached (enclosure 2), and Mr. Blackmore (the Secretary to the Cabinet of Northern Ireland) sent semi-officially a copy of this letter and its enclosure to the Home Office. After consultation between our two Departments, a semi-official letter, of which a copy is attached (enclosure 3), was sent on the 15th March from the Jlome Office to Mr. Blackmore.On the 21st March Mr. Cosgrave, in a letter, of which a copy is attached (enclosure 4), sent to the Prime Minister a copy of his reply to Lord Craigavon.On the 23rd March Sir John Anderson saw Mr. Blackmore at the Home Office. He told him that, as the boundary in question is the boundary not only between the Irish Free State and Northern Ireland, but between the Irish Free State and the United Kingdom, it could not be settled without the British Government being a party to the settlement. Furthermore, it could not be settled by legislation of one of the parties only; The question about which the. Government of Northern Ireland were immediately anxious, namely, the regulation of the fisheries, and any other practical questions, e.g., in connection with navigation rights and the control of lights and buoys, could be settled, as the first question had been settled last year, without the necessity for a prior determination of the boundary, a matter which at the best must necessarily take some time. He understood that both Lord Craigavon and Mr. Cosgrave felt some difficulty in meeting either in Dublin or in Belfast, and in the circumstances he would suggest that an early meeting between representatives of the three Governments concerned should take place as soon as possible in London, in the hope that such a meeting might at any rate lead to a settlement of the practical questions involved, even if agreement on the actual boundary could not at once be reached.On the same date Lord Craigavon sent a further letter to Mr. Cosgrave, of which a copy is attached (enclosure 5), and on the 25th March Mr. Cosgrave sent a reply to Lord Craigavon, of which a copy is also attached (enclosure 6).We concur in the views which Sir John Anderson has expressed to Mr. Blackmore. There is no need, at any rate at this stage, to consider the legal merits of either claim. A solution can only be reached by agreement between all the parties concerned either as to what is in fact the boundary or as to some method of arbitration for the determination of the matters in dispute. It will be seen from the correspondence that the Government of Northern Ireland are disposed to take the view that they are entitled to have the matter settled by the Privy Council under Section 51 of the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, which provides that: &quot;If it &quot; appears to .... a Secretary of State expedient in the public interest that steps shall be taken for the speedy determination of the question whether any Act .... of the Parliament of ... . Northern Ireland .... or any Bill introduced (into that Parliament) .... is beyond the. powers of such Parliament .... the Secretary of State .... may represent the same to His Majesty in Council, and thereupon, if His Majesty so directs, the said question shall be forthwith referred to and heard and determined by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council.&quot; By subsequent legislation, however, the operation of the Government of Ireland Act was restricted so as to apply only to Northern Ireland, and it seems pretty clear, therefore, that the provision quoted does not bind the Irish Free State, and is con-sequently not available for the determination of any question arising between the Governments of that State and of Northern Ireland. In any case, Mr. Cosgrave&apos;s letter of the 25th March shows that he regards the provision in question as inapplicable.The advice of the Judicial Committee on a reference under section 4 of the* The wording- was: &quot;That the two Irish Governments should be recognised as having- equal rights as regards the navigation of Lough Foyle (or) that berry should have free trading- facilities through Lough l-\iy&apos;.e.&quot;
Judicial Committee Act of 18*33 would not bind the Free State unless the, Government of that State should agree to join in the reference. It is conceivable that a decision of the question at issue binding on the Free, State might be given on an appeal in an individual case from the Supreme Court of the Irish Free State to the Privy Council under Article 66 of the Constitution, but it seems to us clear that such a course, which would inevitably give rise, to serious controversy, should be avoided if at all possible.Clearly the matter is one which, if it is to be settled at all, must be settled by discussion and agreement. We therefore recommend that the Prime Minister should at once invite Lord Craigavon and Mr. Cosgrave to meet us in London, at as early a date as possible, to consider the lines on which the immediate practical questions at issue, namely, the regulation of the fisheries during the coining season, and possibly also questions in connection with navigation rights and lights, are to be settled. We do not believe that there should be much difficulty in reaching at any rate a temporary agreement on these points, and it is permissible to hope that an agreement on these points might pave the way to a settlement of the boundary itself, or, at least, to an agreement to refer the question to the Judicial Committee.We attach the draft of a letter (enclosure 7) which we suggest might be sent by the Prime Minister to Lord Craigavon and (mutatis mutandis) to Mr. Cosgrave.W.

bEnclosure 2My dear Cosgrave, March 8, 1927.YOU will recollect that when the Boundary negotiations were proceeding in London I raised with you the question of jurisdiction over the waters of Lough Foyle, acquainting you of the view of our Legal Advisers that the whole of the Lough Foyle area, formed part of the Parliamentary County of Londonderry. In this you will recollect that you and your colleagues were prepared to acquiesce, but were desirous for special reasons that the question should not then be pressed.The matter has now become urgent. During the last two seasons a great deal of illegal fishing was carried on in the Lough which neither the Irish Society, as owners of a several fishery in the Lough, nor its lessees, could have stopped without provoking a breach of the peace, and there is reason to fear that the practice may be renewed in the ensuing season. This state of affairs appears to have arisen, in part at any rate, as a result of a decision given by District Justice Walsh in October 1923 upon a prosecution by the Society against some fishermen resident in County Donegal and charging them with illegal fishing. In that case the Justice declined jurisdiction on the ground that a bond fide question of title was involved and pronounced against the validity of the Crown grant of a several fishery to the Society.I am advised that no agreement between our two Governments would bind individuals, and that the matter must be dealt with by legislation. The fishery season in the Lough commences on the 15th April, and as serious trouble may occur unless this question of jurisdiction is definitely settled before then, I propose to introduce a Bill in our Parliament to prevent difficulties arising in the future.As this projected measure may affect some fishermen in County Donegal I send you an advanced draft of the proposed Bill in order that you may have early intimation of our intentionYours sincerely,President W. T. Cosgrave, CRAIGAVON.Presidents Office,Upper Merrion Street, Dublin.(17 Geo. V.)

Enclosure 3.My dear Blackmore, Home Office, Whitehall, March 15, 1927.WE are obliged to you for sending us a copy of Lord Craigavon&apos;s letter to Mr. Cosgrave, accompanied by a copy of a projected Bill relating to fisheries on Lough Foyle.We trust that you will succeed in arriving at an agreement in regard to this matter with President Cosgrave, and one hardly likes saying anything which indicates that there may possibly be disagreement. Should this, however, unfortunate-nately occur, you will no doubt realize that, having regard to the fact that there has been no determination of the question where the boundary runs, there would be great difficulty in giving the Royal Assent to the Bill.Yours sincerely,C. G. MARKBREITER.C. PI. Blackmore, Esq., C.B.E.,Stormont Castle, Belfast.Enclosure 4.Roinn An Uactarain Sraid Muirbtean Uac My clear Mr. Baldwin, Baile AtaCliat (Dublin), March 21, 1927.I RECEIVED some days ago from Lord Craigavon a copy of a draft Bill which he states it is his intention to introduce in the Northern Parliament, and, if at all possible, to have passed into law before the 15th proximo. The Bill deals with, the matter of the fisheries of Lough Foyle, and its whole basis is that the Northern Government&quot;lays claim to full and exclusive jurisdiction over all parts of the Lough up to high-water mark on the Donegal coast.We, on our side, have always contended that the area in question is within our exclusive jurisdiction.The Bill purports to provide protection for the privileges of certain lessees of fishery rights in Lough Foyle. It is clearly apparent, however, that more serious complications are likely to arise as the result of the assumed jurisdiction implicit in the proposed Bill than could possibly arise from any difficulties of enforcement of mere fishery rights by private parties.I enclose for your information copies of the correspondence which has passed between Lord Craigavon and myself, and a copy of the draft Bill. I would hope, of course, that the measure will not be proceeded with, but inasmuch as I can have no assurance to that effect I feel that I ought not to delay in making you, aware of the situation, having regard to the position of your Government as party to the Treaty of 1921.Believe me,Yours sincerely,W. T. COSGRAVE.The Right Hon. Stanley Baldwin, M.P., Prime Minister.Roinn An Uactarain Sraid Mhuirbhthean Uach My dear Craigavon, Baile Atha Cliath, March 18, 1927.I duly received your letter of the 8th instant and am obliged for the Draft Bill which accompanied it. May I say that my recollection of what took place in London in December 1925, when the Boundary negotiations were proceeding, is not at all in accord with the statements contained in your letter in that connection. Neither I nor any of my colleagues on that occasion acquiesced in the view, mentioned in your letter, that the whole of the Lough Foyle area forms part of the Parliamentary County of Londonderry, nor did we depart from the position which we have maiii-tained since the Treaty that the entire Lough Foyle area falls within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Irish Free State.Without prejudice to that position we did discuss very briefly the insertion of a term in the agreement under which we would guarantee uninterrupted passage of ships up the Lough to Moville and Derry. Even this matter, however, was not pressed by you.
The Bill in question is based upon an assumption of jurisdiction which my Government very strongly controverts, and if the proposal to proceed with the Biil is persisted in it will, I am afraid, create a very serious situation.As your letter and the proposed Bill appear to be based on a misconception of our attitude in the matter and as far more serious complications than any which are likely to arise out of disputed fishery rights might result from the suggested legislation, I feel sure that once our attitude has been indicated to you the measure will not be proceeded with.Yours sincerely,L. T. MacCOSGAIR.The Right Hon. the Lord Viscount Craigavon,Stormont Castle, Strandtown, Belfast.Enclosure 5.Stormont Castle, Belfast, Ulster, My dear Cosgrave, March 23, 1927.I AM in receipt of your letter of the 18th instant, and deeply regret that our respective Governments are now directly at issue as to the jurisdiction over Lough Foyle. I also regret that your recollection of what passed between us during the Boundary negotiations does not coincide with mine. I was not then aware that your Government claimed any jurisdiction over Lough Foyle, nor have I heard of any such claim until I received your letter of the 18th. You say we discussed the question of guarantees to be given by your Government to mine of uninterrupted rights of naviga-tion in the Foyle, but a discussion on these lines could only have taken place on the assumption that your Government had complete jurisdiction over the Lough.I think you must be aware that I never directly or indirectly acquiesced in this assumption or abstained from pressing for a declaration as to our Governments juris-diction over Lough Foyle in any form which would admit the jurisdiction you now claim.I have always been quite satisfied that our Governments claim to Lough Foyle is clear in law and perfectly sound, and I am very sorry that the discussion between us should have proceeded upon a misapprehension as to our respective claims.In view of the disclaimer contained in your letter, I refrain from further reference as to what passed between us during the Boundary negotiations, as it is now clear that our respective, claims cannot be reconciled. In this state of facts, the matter must be determined somehow. The proposed Bill, in our opinion, is clearly within the legislative powers of our Parliament under the Government of Ireland Act, 1920; if, however, the British Cabinet is in any doubt as to whether we are exceeding our powers they can move His Majesty under Section 51 (1) of that Act to have the matter determined by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. Until the rights of both Governments are determined, no negotiations between us can result in any arrangement which will bind our citizens unless such arrangements were to be ratified by identical Acts of both Parliaments and, in addition, our Act ratified by the Imperial Parliament. In view of the claim now put forward by you, I assume this course to be outside the bounds of practical politics.I agree that this question is now more serious than one of disputed fishery rights, but as it has come up directly in this way, I feel that it must be settled definitely before further complications arise.I hope you will agree that the course I propose to take will be the simplest and most satisfactory way of determining this question of jurisdiction for all time, but, if you do not agree, I should like you to let me know how otherwise you propose the matter should be decided.Yburs sincerely,President W. T. Cosgrave., CRAIGAVON.Presidents Office, Upper Merrion Street, Dublin.
Enclosure 6.My dear Craigavon, March 25, 1927.T duly received your letter of the 23rd instant, and, like you, I refrain at this stage from further reference to what took place during the Boundary Discussions of December 1925, save to assure you that all my colleagues who were present at those discussions are in complete agreement in their recollections as to what then took place.1 agree with you that it is a matter for regret that such serious controversial issues as are now under discussion should have arisen between us. Your Govern-ment, however, having decided to introduce in your Parliament the Bill referred to in your previous letter, it was immediately apparent that the terms of the Bill raised the issue in a decisive form, and it became, therefore, vitally necessary for us definitely to restate the position which we have always consistently maintained. Our claim is that the Treaty of December 1921, by its terms and effect, gives the Irish Free State full and exclusive jurisdiction over the entire Lough Foyle area. The validity of that claim admits of no doubt.I cannot accept the suggestion put forward in your letter for dealing with the matter. In our view the machinery provided by Section 51 (1) of the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, while possibly appropriate to local circumstances arising in your area of jurisdiction, is quite inappropriate to deal with a matter essentially arising out of the Treaty and which in substance is really one between ourselves and the British Government as parties to that Treaty. We regard it as unthinkable that the British Cabinet would in the. circumstances of the case put the machinery of that section into operation. Were they to do so, we should, of course, have no concern with such proceedings and should be obliged to ignore them from the outset.Having indicated the views of my Government on this vital question, I venture to suggest that this is pre-eminently a question in which a practical solution satisfac-tory to both our Governments ought earnestly to be sought.On consideration you will, I think, agree that the decision of any tribunal on the question at issue, whatever the decision might be, would not provide any real solution of the difficulty. In these circumstances, and with goodwill on both sides, 1 cannot see that the. matter is incapable of solution without sacrifice of principle. Some time ago you suggested an informal conference, to discuss certain outstanding matters, including the difficulty which had arisen in regard to Salmon Fishery in Lough Foyle. We were quite agreeable that the conference should take place and a date was fixed for the purpose, but you were unable to fulfil the engagement. It is not easy to see why, in a case of this nature, which is so clearly one for settlement by negotiation, it should be assumed that such negotiation is outside the bounds of practical politics. If legislation should be required to give complete effect to any agreement which we might arrive at, such legislation should be quite easy&apos; of accomplishment.Yours sincerely, (Signed) W. T. COSGRAVE.The Right Hon. the Viscount Craigavon,Stormont Castle, Strandtown, Belfast.Enclosure 7.Draft Letter from the Prime Minister to Lord Craigavon and Mr. Cosgrave.MY colleagues and I have very carefully considered the question which we understand has arisen with regard to the jurisdiction over Lough Foyle.It seems to us to be clear, in the first place, that inasmuch as the question relates not only to the boundary between the Irish Free State and Northern Ireland, but to the boundary between the Irish Free State and the United Kingdom, it is one in which His Majesty&apos;s Government in Great Britain is necessarily interested.Furthermore, if any legislation directly raising the boundary issue is necessary at all, it seems clear to us that complementary legislation on both sides is necessary, and that such legislation can only be passed by agreement between the Governments concerned.The question of the precise position of the boundary in or through Lough Foyle appears to us, however, to be in itself not of immediate importance.    What is of
importance at the moment is the practical (and urgent) question of the regulation of the fisheries in Lough Foyle.: f In these circumstances, we would suggest for your consideration that a meeting should be held at as early a date as possible in London between representatives of;the three Governments for the purpose of reaching an agreement as to the lines onwhich this question and any other practical questions which it is desirable to dispose of can be settled; and that, meanwhile, further discussion on the abstract questionof the boundary itself should be postponed, and that no legislation on either sideshould be introduced into Parliament.I should be grateful if you could let me know at a very early date whether you agree with this proposal, and if so whether would be a convenientdate for the meeting.T , .   .,    , .,    .   Mr. Cosgrave.- I have sent a similar letter to f a n   .--Lord Craigavon.o
