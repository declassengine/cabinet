Paper No. 791-B and CP. 126 (27).)COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE.Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee.THE SITUATION IN CHINA WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TOPEKING AND TIENTSIN.Report by the Chiefs of Staff.1. WE met at 12-30 p.m. on the 11th April at the instigation of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and with the Prime Ministers approval, to consider the situation in China with special reference to Peking and Tientsin.2. The situation which has arisen in regard to these two places is described in extenso in a memorandum prepared by the Foreign Office, and in telegrams Nos. 634 and 642 from Sir Miles Lampson. This memorandum and these two telegrams are attached as Appendices (A), (B) and (C) to this Report.3. Having regard to the circumstances outlined in these documents, we have been asked to advise specifically : &apos;(a.) What is the maximum contribution which we can make to the defence of the Legations and/or Tientsin?(b.) Upon what conditions as regards the co-operation of other Powers we can make it.In reporting on these two questions we propose to deal with the Legations at Peking separately from the defence of Tientsin.The Legations at Peking.4. The defence of the Legations at Peking involves a problem somewhat similar to that which was presented to the Allies at the time of the Boxer rebellion in 1900-01. It will be recalled that on that occasion the Legations were besieged on the 13th June, the strength of the Legation guards amounting in total to approxi-mately 400 men, composed mostlv of marines. For the relief of the Legations an international force-approximately 2,000 strong, composed entirely of sailors and marines and comprising four field guns and eleven machine guns had been built up at Tientsin, and left by rail for Peking on the 10th June, leaving behind at Tientsin an international force 2,500 strong. On the 18th June the Peking relief force was severely attacked at Langfang, and on the 19th it was decided to with-draw to Tientsin, which was eventually reached on the 27th June after severe lighting. Meanwhile the, Powers had sent out substantial reinforcements to China, and by the 29th June the strength of the forces available at Tientsin and Taku had been increased to approximately 14,000 with 53 field guns and 36 machine guns. The first step towards the relief of Peking was the, capture of the native city of Tientsin. This was effected on the 13th and 14th July by an international force Ll 0014] -P
approximately 4,000 strong, and on the 5th August the advance to Peking was com-menced with an international force some 20,000 strong with 70 guns.   After considerable fighting Peking was relieved on the 14th August. &apos; i   During the course of these operations the total number of allied troops sent to China amounted to no less than 94,000 men, the British contribution being 21,000.A more detailed account of these operations is attached as Appendix (D), but the above summary will suffice to show that the. defence of the Legations at Peking might well involve a very considerable commitment, even with the whole-hearted co-operation of all the Powers.5.   At the present time the international forces available at Peking and TientsinarePeking. U.S.A.Great Britain Prance Italy Japan405 162 248 104 156U.S.A. Great Britain France Italy JapanTientsin.823 806 1.066 344 336Total1,075Total3,3756. Such a force is, of course, quite inadequate to ensure the safety of the Legations and to keep open the long lines of communication from Peking to Tangku (the port of Taku) via Tientsin, and considerable reinforcements must be envisaged, before the maintenance of the Legations at Peking can be viewed with equanimity. Of these reinforcements, presumably Great Britain would have to provide her quota, which would entail measures of mobilisation, since Section A of the Reserve -i.e., that portion of the Reserve which is liable to be called up for immediate service overseas has been absorbed in furnishing the contingents which have already been despatched to China.7. We are. therefore, firmly convinced that no attempt should be made to retain our Legation and Legation guards in Peking, beyond the point when they can withdraw without requiring assistance from extraneous sources in the form of additional troops. The decision as to when this point has been reached must, of course, rest with our Minister at Peking, and we recommend that he should be instructed on no account to run the risk of being beleaguered in such a way as might involve the despatch of a relief column to extricate him and his Legation.Defence of Tientsin.8. As already mentioned there are at the present time 3,375 international troops at Tientsin. We estimate that to protect the Settlement itself an additional force of at least cne brigade is required. But it will not suffice merely to protect the Settlement; the lines of communication from the sea must also be kept open. These run to Tangku (the port of Taku), where large ships cannot approach nearer than 8 miles to the shore, or via Tangku to Chinwangtao, a distance of approximately 170 miles, where there are harbour facilities. In order to keep the line of communication from Tientsin to Tangku open, we consider that approximately five brigades will be necessary, making a total reinforcement of two divisions in addition to the 3,500 troops already at Tientsin. This estimate considerably exceeds that recommended by the foreign commandants at Tientsin (vide Appendix C) for the protection of Peking and Tientsin and the line of communication from Peking through Tientsin to Tangku, and we cannot agree with them that a further 5,000 men will suffice to guard the railway line from Tangku to Chinwangtao, should it be considered necessary to keep the latter open as a port for reinforcements.95 As our contribution towards this international force of two divisions we might possibly have available the one brigade at present under orders for China, but its availability for this purpose cannot be relied upon. In any event, it will not reach Hong Kong its present destination-before the middle of May, and ^ role on arrival innst be governed by the circumstances obtaining at that time. The
situation at present appears to be developing rather more favourably for the Northerners, but there is no guarantee that this trend will be maintained. Rapid and violent fluctuations must be anticipated, and according to the march of events, the Brigade, now under weigh, might be required at Shanghai or Canton more urgently than at Tientsin.10. The answers to the questions put to us in regard to Tientsin arc therefore as follows : (a.) We can make no contribution to the defence of Tientsin until the end of May, when, if the situation in other parts of China permits, we may be able to provide a maximum of one Brigade.(?;.) The use of this Brigade for the defence of Tientsin is dependent upon the provision by the other Powers of the balance of the two Divisions which we consider the minimum force necessary for holding Tientsin and keeping open the lines of communication to Tangkn.11. In this connection, we would point out that our contribution is not disproportionately small, having regard to the fact that Ave are bearing a much greater portion than any other Power of the responsibility and cost of the defence of Shanghai.(Signed) BEATTY.G.

APPENDIX (A).Copy of a Minute from the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to the Secretary, Committee of Imperial Defence.Sir M. Hankey.I BEG- that you will at once lay before the Chiefs of Staff Committee  1. The attached memorandum on Sir Miles Lampson&apos;s telegram No. C42. 2. Draft telegram to Sir M. Lampson. 3. Draft telegram to Tokyo and Washington.There is a certain inconsistency between the wording of 2 and 3 which can be adjusted when policy is finally decided, and when we know exactly what share we ca -contribute to an effective defence of Tientsin.For the information of the Chiefs of Staff I should say that I fully recognise that I must cut my cloak according to the cloth available, and that I cannot pursue a policj to which our forces are unequal. But J share to the full Sir Miies Lampson&apos;! apprehensions as to the results of a policy of evacuation.   Its adoption may well (a) precipitate the very crisis which we dread and(6) lead directly to the overthrow of Chang Tso-lin and the Bolshevisation of all China.It must (c) gravely affecL our prestige in the East,(d) do irreparable injury to material British interests.In these circumstances I feel bound to ask (i.) what is the maximum contribution which we can make to the defence of theLegations and/or Tientsin, (ii.) upon what conditions as regards the co-operation of other Powers we can make it.It will then be for the Cabinet to decide whether it is willing to make this effort on the prescribed terms.(Initialled) A. C.April 10, 1027.Enclosure No. 1 to Appendix (A). Memorandum:When the question of Tientsin was first examined by the Chiefs of Staff in January last, their view was that the troops at present there were sufficient only for the maintenance of order in times of popular disturbance and would be in a position of grave danger if exposed to attack by a large organised Chinese force ; it was doubtful if they could keep open communication with the Peking Legation in any grave circumstances; and in the event of serious trouble threatening, reinforcements could only be obtained from Japan ; our naval forces could not co-operate, as Tientsin cannot be reached by water.These views were put to Sir M. Lampson in our telegram No. 25 of the 13th January.Accordingly, when we announced to Sir M. Lampson in our telegram No. 39 of the 17th January, that His Majesty&apos;s Government had decided that Shanghai must bo held at any cost, we added that Tientsin must be primarily Japan&apos;s care.About the end of March Sir M. Lampson began to become uneasy about the possible reaction at Tientsin if the Southern successes continued, and he summoiW the Colonel Commandant from Tientsin to discuss the question. After seeing the Colonel Commandant, he reported in his telegram No. 542 of tho 28th March that he thought one more&apos; battalion at Tientsin was immediately necessary, from which 150 men
could be detached to strengthen the Legation guard, wnich would also be provided in addition with a junior officer and twenty gunners.To this telegram we replied in our telegram No. 220 of the 30th March that the considered opinion of our military advisers was that the despatch of a single additional British battalion to Tientsin would not suffice to meet any serious eventual^&apos;. We also instructed Sir M. Lampson to explain the situation to his Japanese colleague and say that we relied on the Japanese Government for the provision of adequate protection for the foreign interests at Tientsin and to ask him to urge his Government to take whatever additional measures were necessary to that end.In his telegram No. 597 of the lst*April Sir M. Lampsou reported the views of the Japanese Government as follows: The Japanese were strengthening their troops at Tientsin by three or four companies in May next. This they considered to be quite sufficient to cope with mob violence. The Japanese Minister thought it quite inadequate, and was accordingly recommending his Government to be prepared to send down troops at once from Manchuria if serious trouble arose.On the 3rd April Sir John Tilley reported the Minister for Foreign Affairs as saying that the Japanese were in a position to reinforce Tientsin if necessary, but that he refused to be nervous about either Tientsin or Peking.Sir M. Lampson already, in his telegram No. 591 of the 1st April, stated his strong opinion that, whatever the Japanese reply might be, we should not bank on Japan ; unless His JMajesty&apos;s Government were prepared themselves to take precautions in advance and if necessary alone, he requested authority to warn British nationals accordingly so that ihose who wished might get out before the crisis arose ; he re com-mended that one infantry brigade should be at once despatched to Tientsin aud that the Legation guard should be doubled and gunners provided.He added that the situation threatened to become similar to that of 1900, and that if the arrangements made under the 1901 protocol for the defence of tho Legation were not carried out the question of the withdrawal of the Legation might arise at short notice.It was in these circumstances that the Chiefs of Staff again considered the question of Tientsiu, and after discussion by the Cabinet our telegram to Peking No. 2M7 of the 4th April was sent. It is that telegram which has drawn from Sir M. Lampson the telegram now under consideration (No 63J of 7th April).Sir M. Lampson&apos;s telegram No. 591 caused us some alarm and the question he raised was considered on the assumption that the worst which he thought might happen, would happen, namely, that a situation similar to that of 1900 might arise. (&quot; We are faced with a situation and anti-foreign movement that threatens to become very similar to that of DOO.&quot;) The conclusion which His Majesty&apos;s Government reached and which was communicated to Sir M. Lampson in our telegram No. 237 was briefly (a) that the defence of Peking and even the defence of Tientsin and its commu-liications would demand more troops than we alone could supply ; (6), this being so, lie must be prepared to evacuate both Peking and Tientsin if the worst happened, and he was given discretion to issue any warnings and to take any steps that he might think necessary without any further reference home.This telegram of ours has somewhat alarmed Sir M. Lampson, and he seems to he somewhat surprised that we have taken him at his word and have considered the situation on the assumption that the worst will happen. He is obviously most reluctant to take the responsibility either of ordering the evacuation of Peking or the evacuation of British subjects horn Tientsin.There are several contingencies involved. These are : (a) the evacuation of British subjects from Peking and district ; (b) the evacuation of the British Legation from Peking; (c) the evacuation of British subjects from Tientsin, both from within and from without the Concession ; (d) the question whether such evacuation shall be carried out by us independently ur as part of a general evacuation of all or most foreigners.It would be best to take Sir M. Lampson&apos;s points seriatim. He very rightly asks us to look at the question in all its bearings as part of our general policy in China.1. Sir M. Lampson&apos;s description of the desired object of His Majesty&apos;s Government in paragraph i! of his telegram is accurate.2. Failing the achievement of the desired object in the manner proposed, he^ sees three possible alternatives, namely, (a) coercion of the south; (6) total abandon-nient of our own interests in China or in whatever part of China the southern party
holds; and (c) the concentration of British nationals in the three cardinal points of Shanghai, Tientsin and Canton, there to await developments indefinitely. Sir M. Larnpson rightly rules out the first alternative.The second and third alternatives do not, I think, really cover the whole problem. Our policy is neither total abandonment, nor is it concentration in any specified places. We desire British nationals to stay and British interests to be maintained in all parts of China where they may safely remain. If they are in danger and wc cannot defend them, they must evacuate. If they are not in clanger, or if we are in a position to defend them in case of clanger, then we desire that they should stay where they are. We have advised evacuation of British subjects from places up-country where tbev are either in clanger or cannot be defended if they should fall into danger. But we have decided that with the means at our disposal there is one place and one place only which we are in a position to defend at any cost, and that is Shanghai, and one of the reasons why we decided to defend it any cost was that we were advised that evacua-tion was impracticable, we therefore had no alternative. We are not told that evacuation of Canton or Tientsin is impracticable, and we are, on the other hand, advised that we have not the forces available to defend Tientsin if it is heavily attacked. There is, therefore, no alternative but to evacuate if the lives of British subjects there are placed in danger-. We have never said anything to justify the impression which both Sir M. Lampson and our people in China generally are here reported to have, that His Majesty&apos;s Government had decided to stand independently, if necessary, on the three vital centres of Shanghai, Tientsin and Canton. On the contrary, we have always made clear that, as far as Tientsin is concerned, it must be defended, if at all, by the Japanese.The limit of our policy of evacuation, which Sir M. Lampson asks us to defiue, is, therefore, that the one place which we will defend at any cost is Shanghai, but that this does not necessarily mean that we have decided to evacuate everything except Shanghai, and, still less, that we are prepared to announce to the world that this is our policy. We shall only evacuate as and when we are forced to and not sooner. We have placed upon Sir M. Lampson the responsibility of deciding when that moment has arrived as far as concerns Tientsin and Peking. It is a heavy responsibility and one which he is most reluctant to assume, but, things being as they are, he is the only person qualified to shoulder it, and he has therefore been given discretion to act without further reference home, lest there should be any unnecessary delay in case of urgent danger.3. Sir M. Lampson asks whether he is right in presuming that His Majesty&apos;s Government are prepared to undertake the defence of both places and keep open communication between them if other Powers will co-operate.The answer to this surely is that His Majesty&apos;s Government are prepared to furnish what forces they can provide, but only if the total forces provided by all the Powers is in their view adequate for the purpose for which it is designed. Our advisers say that two divisions would be required for the defence of Tientsin and its communications, that is to say, I take it, in order to make Tientsin a safe place to live in, and to allow of the evacuation of foreigners from Peking. This is a very large force, and the experience of Shanghai makes it most unlikely that it will be forthcoming.4. Sir M. Lampson also asks to be sure that the decision to evacuate Tientsin for certain circumstances has not been decided on purely military grounds, but after full weight has been given to possible political and economic consequences.The answer to this is that the decision has been taken on military considerations, which is, in fact, the only possible practical criterion upon which to decide the issue. However serious the political and economic consequences of evacuation may be, the fact remains that if we cannot by force, make it safe for our nationals to stay they must evacuate.   There is no alternative.5. Sir M. Lampson fears a storm of protest among British interests in China, and thinks it unlikely that once we evacuate Tientsin we shall ever be able to re-establish our trade.This may unfortunately be only too true, but there is no help for it.6. He also asks us to consider whether independent evacuation of Tientsin would not play into the hands of our Japanese commercial rivals.We do not, however, propose the independent evacuation of Tientsin. It is possible, of course, as was the case at Hankow, that the attack, if it comes at
Tientsin, may be directed first and exclusively against our concession. That can only be decided when the time comes. As things stand, however, it is most unlikely that our subjects in Tientsin, whatever the warning given them, will leave the city if they find that foreigners of other nationalities are prepared to stay. There is, therefore, hardly likely to be an independent evacuation of Tientsin. Even if it were announced that we could supply no forces for the defence of Tientsin, our announcement would probably not have a much more alarming effect upon our own nationals than upon other foreigners in the city, and the evacuation, if it then-started, would probably be much more international than purely British.7. Sir M. Lampson thinks it essential that the ground should be prepared by some governmental statement in England before any step is inaugurated by him.This would surely be most unwise. It could only be done here in a public and ostentatious way and would create much unnecessary alarm. Advice given to British nationals and intimation given to foreign representatives by His Majesty&apos;s repre-sentative on the spot is surely in every way preferable to governmental declarations at a distance. Sir M. Lampson&apos;s responsibility is a heavy one, but not heavier than he will probably be called upon to sustain.As regards Peking, two questions arise : (a.) British nationals; (b.) The Legation.As regards the first, Sir M. Lampson is taking the right course in advising British subjects to leave quietly.As regards the Legation, he seems to be under some misapprehension. We have not urged upon him the immediate evacuation of the Legation nor have we urged upon him the independent withdrawal of the British Legation alone.All we have done is to give full consideration to the very serious warning he sent us in his telegram No. 591; to tell him that if the worst conies to the worst we have no forces available alone to keep him safely in Peking and maintain his communications with the sea; and to tell him further that, therefore, if the worst does come to the worst he had better get away in time; and we have sriven him discretion to do so. The moment of evacuation we have left to him, and it seems hardly likely that he will think it necessary unless his colleagues also think it necessary; and that, therefore, the question of independent evacuation will hardly arise. What we especially want to avoid is another siege of the Legations and another expedition to escue them.There has now been a further development.In his telegram No. 642 of the 8th April Sir M. Lampson reports (L) That the foreign commandants at Tientsin have advised that the strength of each foreign contingent should be at once doubled, and that the strength should be brought up to a total of 25,000 men as early as possible.(2.) That the five Ministers have agreed to recommend this strongly to their governments.(3.) That he has informed his colleagues of the instructions contained in our telegram No. 237 about his being prepared for evacuation. This rather staggered them.Sir M. Lampson finally urges that if we are prepared to contribute our quota we should take the question up with the least possible delay at other capitals. This is clearly a question for the C.I.D.Our quota will have to be at least a brigade, even if all the Powers contribute equally, and I doubt whether we shall be able to come in to that extent unless our military advisers change their minds. The principal burden will have to be borne by Japan and the United States.  Everything depends on their attitude.(Signed) W. STRANG.April 9, 1927.This memorandum by M, Strang, and ^f^^Sa&quot;that BaS s submitted herewith have been drawn uj onJflg fitments at shanghai they Government have definitely decided that with their co Tientsin or Pekinglave and will have no sufficient forces available tpi^Wg, u     f comrnuniCation n such numbers as to assure the security of ^J^^^urta of the 25,000 men between them; as also that they could not even pi^Jggg^ low asked for by the local military advisers for that purpose.
If these assumptions are correct, I think the memorandum states the position most clearly, and that Sir M. Lampson should be informed of the position as shown in the draft prepared by Mr. Strang. -If these assumptions are, however, either incorrect or doubtful, I am most strongly of opinion that the position and its possibilities should be carefully re-examined by the competent military and naval authorities as it is to my mind essential and only fair that Sir M. Lampson should be informed of what can or cannot be done for the protection of British lives and vital interests in Northern China.I do not of course know what is the task or ultimate destination of the fresh brigade which is now being despatched to Hong Kong. It may be. that its work is already cut out for it and fixed. But if there is any possibility that in a sudden emergency or crisis His Majesty&apos;s Government could and would order this brigade, or indeed any other troops, to Tien-tsin or Peking, then I think this draft telegram must be revised and held up until we are in a position to tell Sir M. Lampson quite clearly and definitely what amount of additional British force can in the last resort be despatched for the defence of those cities.It must be remembered that a very heavy responsibility is being placed upon Sir M. Lampson in this matter. It is in the circumstances inevitable that he should have to bear this responsibility, in consulation at his discretion with his foreign colleagues. But it is on that account all the more imperative that His Majesty&apos;s Government should give him the clearest possible guidance as to the exact degree&apos;to which he can count on any military or naval reinforcement. It would be altogether unfair to him and undesirable on more general grounds to leave him under the impression that he can count on no more British troops, and so compel him pre-maturely to arrange for evacuation and withdrawal from Peking and Tientsin, and then at the last moment, in the face of some sudden crisis, rush sufficient troops there to enable him to remain.G. MOUNSEY.April 9, 1927. _I entirely agree with Mr. Mounsey. A brigade is starting for Hong Kong. If it can be made available for Tientsin, I think Sir M. Lampson should certainly be told at once. If not, then the draft telegram, which is based on the assumption that the despatch of further troops is out of the question, can stand.V. \V.April 9, 1927.Enclosure No. 2 to Appendix (A). Copy of Telegram to Sir M. Lampson, Peking.(No.-.) Foreign Office, April   ,1927.Your telegram No. 634 of 7th April: Evacuation of Peking and Tientsin.In your telegram No. 591 you said that unless Llis Majesty&apos;s Government were themselves prepared to take precautions in advance and, if necessary, alone for the protection of British subjects in Tientsin, you would be glad of authority to warn British nationals accordingly, so that those who desired to leave might do so before the crisis arose. You furtlier warned me that the situation threatened to become similar to that of 1900, and that the question of the withdrawal of the Legation from Peking might arise at the shortest notice unless the Legation could be defended. Your warnings were given the fullest consideration, and the object of my telegram No. 237 was to make clear to you first that, if the danger you feared materialised His Majesty&apos;s Government had no resources available to undertake single-handed the defence of the Peking Legation or even of Tientsin and its communications; and secondly, to give you, in accordance with your request, full discretion at a moment to be chosen by yourself to issue the necessary warnings to British nationals at Peking and Tientsin and to withdraw your Legation from Peking. It was not my intention to urge you to take any immediate step in regard either to the witn-drawal of British subjects or of your Legation, or to suggest that any such step should be taken independently by yourself alone. On the contrary, I should imagine that a situation requiring the evacuation of British subjects and the British Legation would equally require the evacuation of foreign nationals and foreign Legations generally.    His Majesty&apos;s Government realise that they have placed a heavy
responsibility upon you, but vou alone are in a position to decide in circumstances which change so rapidly whether evacuation is necessary or not.I fully realise political and economic consequences of evacuation, but in the circumstances decision must be governed almost exclusively by the fact that having committed ourselves to the defence of Shanghai at any cost we have no forces available for the adequate defence single-handed of Peking and Tientsin. Forces we could contribute to an international contingent would for the same reason necessarily be small, and we should not consider it safe to contribute them unless the international contingent were in our view adequate for the purpose for which it was designed, whether for the defence of Tientsin alone or for that of Peking as well.You will understand therefore that the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government is not fully covered by either the second or the third of the alternatives set forth in the third paragraph of your telegram. I do not know where you can have gained the impression that His Majesty&apos;s Government had decided to stand independently if necessary on the three vital centres of Shanghai, Tien-tsin and Canton, for it has always been our view (see my telegrams Nos. 25 and 39) that the defence of Tien-tsin must devolve primarily upon Japan and it was our hope that if our decision conveyed to you in my No. 237 was clearly understood by your Japanese and American colleagues, their Governments might be induced to do their full share in the defence of these places and not depend upon us for an effort, which, in view of the large contribution we have made at Shanghai, it is neither reasonable to expect from us nor possible for us to make. On the other hand, we have not adopted as a deliberate policy the total abandonment of British interests in China or in what-ever part of China the Southern party holds. We desire British nationals to stay and British interests to be maintained in all parts of China where they may safely remain. If they are in danger and cannot be defended they must leave. We favour evacuation of British subjects from places up country or elsewhere where they are either in danger or cannot be defended if they should fall into danger. And we have decided that, with the means at our disposal, there is one place and one place only which we are in a position to defend at any cost, namely, Shanghai. We are on the other hand advised that we have not the force available to defend Tientsin also if it is heavily attacked and other Powers will not take their full share in the general schemes of defence. We have therefore no choice but to evacuate it if the lives of British subjects are in danger.This does not, however, necessarily mean that we have decided to evacuate everything except Shanghai and still less that we are prepared to announce this as our declared policy. Our policy is to evacuate only if circumstances make that course necessary.I have now received your telegram No. 642 and note that you have now intimated to your foreign colleagues the views of His Majesty&apos;s Government as instructed in my telegram No. 237. resolution of foreign commandants has now been carefully considered and I hope to give you my view7s very shortly.Enclosure No. 3 to Appendix (A). Draft to Tokyo, Washington.   (Repeat Paris and Rome.) Peking telegram No. 642.His Majesty&apos;s Minister at Peking had already thought it his duty to warn His Majesty&apos;s Government that there is serious danger lest a situation should arise at Peking similar to that which developed in 1901. You will observe that the commandants at Tientsin take an equally grave view of the position, and demand that the international force at Tientsin-Peking should be raised to the figure of 25,000.His Majesty&apos;s Government have undertaken the main burden of the defence of the settlement at Shanghai. It is not reasonable to expect that they should in addition take an equal burden in the North, and they have instructed His Majesty&apos;s Minister that unless effective international co-operation can be secured he must in case of necessity evacuate both Peking and Tientsin. His Majesty&apos;s Government realize the serious consequences of such a decision for other nations as well as for us, and it is with the greatest reluctance that they have brought themselves to contemplate it as [16014] c
inevitable unless Japan and the United States are prepared to do their share in the. defence of our common interests against a danger which threatens us all equally.You should so inform the Government of Tokyo/Washington. You should add that we are advised that the commandants estimate of 25,000 is reasonable, that we are prepared to contribute to it a force of if Japan and the United States areprepared to supply the balance, and you should ask for a very early declaration of their intentions in order that we may at once issue the necessary instructions whether for reinforcement or evacuation.APPENDIX (B).Decypher telegram from Sir M. Lampson (Peking), No. 634, dated April 7, 1927. (Immediate.)I AM somewhat perturbed by your telegram No. 237 of 5th April (evacuation of Peking and Tien-tsin), and although time presses I feel that before issuing any warning or making any announcement to my foreign colleagues in the sense thereof it is necessary to have a clear understanding regarding our general policy in China.In my telegram No. 540 of 28th March I outlined various courses which seemed to be open to us, but it will be best perhaps if I restate the position as I understand it: I assume desired object of His Majesty&apos;s Government, if circumstances permit, is a settlement by agreement with both South and North until such time as it may be possible to make a general agreement with a united China. But I assume Nanking has interrupted this policy, which, in so far as it concerns the South, is bound to remain suspended (a) so long as Nanking is unexpiated, and (b) so long as there is real danger of repetitions of Nanking, i.e., so long as the South are unable to show that they are a responsible Government actuated by bond fide good intention.If South make it impossible for us to resume our policy of conciliation the choice has hitherto seemed to me to lie between (1) coercion of the South; (2) total abandonment of our own interests in China or in whatever part of China Southern party holds; or (3) concentration of British nationals in the three cardinal points of Shanghai, Tien-tsin and Canton, there to awrait developments indefinitely.The first of these alternatives is, I take it, ruled out. It is regarding second and third that I am in doubt and that I beg for enlightenment as to policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government. I understood that His Majesty&apos;s Government, when they sent out defence force to Shanghai, had set their face against total abandonment of China, and I shared the impression, which I am sure is general out here, that they had decided to stand independently, if necessary, on the three vital centres Shanghai, Tien-tsin and Canton. From your telegram under reply, this impression seems to have been mistaken, and I therefore feel constrained to ask, for my guidance in dealing with rapidly changing circumstances, for a definite pronouncement from His Majesty&apos;s Government as to maximum extent to which they are prepared to defend British interests in China. In other words, do they contemplate complete abandon-ment, and, if not, what is the limit of policy of evacuation ?I note that your telegram under reference emphasises the fact that we are not prepared to defend Peking and Tien-tsin alone. Am I right in presuming that His Majesty&apos;s Government are still prepared to undertake defence of both places and to keep open communication between them if other Powers wall co-operate ? I feel it necessary that I should know mind of His Majesty&apos;s Government definitely on this point before I make any announcement to my colleagxres. In any case, whether we are prepared for joint defence measures or whether we decide definitely to evacuate, I feel that we owe it to other Powers first to discuss matters with them and endeavour to agree upon joint action.I should be glad to be assured also that decision to evacuate Tien-tsin in certain circumstances has not been decided on purely military grounds but after full weight has been given to possible political and economic consequences. Politically it is obvious that mere knowledge of our intention to go will have the worst effect on Chang Tso-lin and on his prospects and will correspondingly strengthen and encourage Southern cause. Economically, of course, it will have far-reaching effect on British China trade in general, and will, I fear, arouse storm of protest among British interests in China, since Tien-tsin is second largest and second most important British community here, and it is unlikely that, once gone, we shall ever
APPENDIX (C).Decode telegram from Sir M. Lampson (Peking), No. 642, dated April 8, 1927. MY telegram No. 634*Following resolution received to-day from foreign commandants at Tien-tsin : &quot;Foreign commandants at conference 6th April unanimously agreed to-make the following recommendations to their respective Ministers: &quot; (a.) Considering state of uncertainty which prevails in North China, it is desirable that strength of each foreign contingent be doubled forthwith.&quot; (6.) If Southern anti-foreign movement looks like spreading to North China it would be desirable to immediately increase strength of foreign forces to 20,000 men with most up-to-date equipment, including aviation units, in order to ensure adequate defence of Peking and Tien-tsin and to keep open communica-tions between the former and Tangku (minimum demand). In view of importance of mines at Tongshan and possible necessity for keeping open Chin Wang-tao as a port for reinforcement it may be necessary to guard railway between [ ? group omitted] and Tangku. In this case additional [ ? 5,000] men would be needed (maximum demand).&quot; (c.) Further, commandants are of the opinion that the more troops are on the spot the less likely will it be necessary to take military action, and to this end submit best solution would be to increase garrison in North China forthwith to maximum of 25,000 asked for in paragraph (b) above.&quot;These were discussed at meeting to-day of Japanese, American, French and Italian Ministers and myself, and it was unanimously agreed strongly to recommend them to our Governments.Japanese Minister, who has special sources of information, gave us gloomiest forecast of the future unless some such step was taken, and evidently has reliable information that terrorist methods of Nanking may be, and almost certainly will be, repeated here and at Tien-tsin if and when the South get here unless steps are taken betimes to be in readiness.I took an opportunity to tell them your instructions to me. We were not prepared to take the  defensive steps alone; we were already carrying more than our share elsewhere,&apos; and it was the turn of others. But I felt little doubt that if other Powers were prepared to play up over North China we should be ready to[1(5014&quot; Sec Appendix (B).be able to get back. I will endeavour to obtain and telegraph to you figures showing extent of British interests, but an approximate idea of their magnitude can be gained from a &quot; Report on Future Government of British Municipal Area &quot; drawn up by a British advisory committee at Tien-tsin which was forwarded to you via Siberia on 23rd March in my despatch No. 236 and should reach you in a few days!It is also for consideration whether independent evacuation of Tien-tsin would not play into the hands of our Japanese commercial rivals.In any case, decision to be taken is one of such importance that I think it essential that ground should be prepared by some Governmental statement in England before any step is inaugurated by this Legation.I have dealt so far mainly with Tien-tsin, but your telegram under reference refers also to evacuation of Peking. I assume this to refer not only to evacuation of British nationals, but also of Legation. With regard to nationals, I am of course taking normal precautions regarding their safety in case of trouble and am already encouraging such of them as can do so to leave quietly for their summer holidays. As regards Legation, I quite see that His Majesty&apos;s Government would be unwilling to leave it inadequately protected at the risk of repetition of Boxer episode, but, on the other hand, I earnestly trust that risk of this possibility will not be exaggerated and that against it will be weighed the enormous loss of prestige which independent withdrawal would undoubtedly involve.I propose to await your observations on this telegram before taking any action under authority given in your telegram under reference, but matter is pressing.(Repeated to Shanghai, Commander-in-chief, Hong Kong, Tokyo and Tien-tsin.)
contribute our quota. Otherwise I was afraid that I should have to bring up with them the question of possible evacuation of the Legation and of Tien-tsin. This seemed to stagger them. Japanese Minister was particularly emphatic that he would make strongest appeal to his Government to meet suggestions made by the commandants. ....United States Minister said that he could not back request precisely m its present form, not because he disagreed with a word of it, but because he had already submitted proposals of more far-reaching kind to his Government which he hoped to see go through with some little confidence. These he intimated privately to me were the despatch of more than one-fifth of the proposed total of 25,000 proposed by commandants.If His Maiesty&apos;s Government agree to proposals, may I suggest that they take it up with the least possible delay at other capitals ? I should feel very much happier in every respect if I knew that this step was being taken.     -(Repeated  to  Tokyo,   Shanghai,   Commander-in-chief,   Hong  Kong and appendix (D).Note on the Operation in North China, 1900-01. 1. Events leading up to Operations.The troubles in North China during 1900, resulting in the siege of the Peking legations and in the relief expedition despatched by the allied Powers, arose from the development of a secret society called the &quot;Fists of Patriotic Union,&quot; whence arose the term &quot;Boxers.&quot; Originally founded with the most patriotic intentions (cf. the Kuomintang in 1923-27), and loudly professing its loyal and patriotic aims, it avoided collision with the Peking Government, and proceeded in 1899 to acts of hostility against Christians in Shantung. Before the close of that year the movement had spread to Chihli, and by the beginning of May, 1900, the situation at Peking had become very serious.The Foreign Ministers addressed strong notes of protest to the Chinese Govern-ment, and received assurances that the legations would receive special care, with the result that little or no preparation was made for defence.2. The First Legation Guards.On the 28th May, the Boxers burnt Fengtai Railway Station near Peking, and the Ministers telegraphed to Tientsin for armed guards for the legations. These were forthwith despatched and, to the number of 337 of various Nationalities, reached Peking without opposition on the 31st May.At the beginning of June the railway to Tientsin was cut, and on the 13th June the Boxers made their first attack on the Legation quarter, where the majority of the Europeans in Peking had collected. Thus commenced the siege of the legations. At this time the total strength of the legation Guards was 415 mostly marines composed as follows t1- g2British      ... -&apos;&quot; 87Russians    ... &quot;,&apos; 53Americans ... --r-                                &quot; 51Germans *-\. 48French      ... .35Austrians   ... &apos;&quot;* 29Italians     ... &quot;&apos; 25Japanese    ... - - -         - - -                     &quot;.-&apos;,.   _^t * 1 ... - 415 .1. otai3. The Garrison of Tientsin.Prior to May, 1900, there does not seem to have been any permanent garrison at Tientsin. The increasing anxiety that the anti-foreign movement was steadily drawing nearer the Concessions resulted, however, in a strong,concentration of the naval forces of all the interested Powers off Taku.Gradually an international force was built up entirely of sailors and marines-at Tientsin, and on the 10th June a relief force for Peking, 2,066 strong, left Tientsin by rail for Peking; leaving behind at Tientsin an international force 2,536 strong.

The Attack on the Taku Forts.Between the 14th and 17th June it became obvious that the Chinese were about to oppose further landings at Taku and Tongku, and that the Pei-ho was mined. The Allies, therefore, decided -to occupy Taku and Tongku with an international force. The force which landed for this purpose consisted of : British Germans .. Japanese .. Russians .. Italians ..

Failure of the Peking Relief Force.The Peking relief force which had left Tientsin on the 10th .lune. under the command of Admiral Seymour, was severely attacked on the 18th June at Langfang. On the 19th it was decided to withdraw to Tientsin which was reached after severe fighting on the 27th June.Meanwhile, the Powers had sent out substantial reinforcements and the strength of the forces at Tientsin and Taku on the 29th June was made up as follows : Austrian ... ... ... ... 139British   ... ... ... ... 1,884French   ... ... ... ... 404German  ... ... ... ... 1,344Italian    ... ... ... ... 138Japanese... ... ... ... 3,828Russian  ... ... ... ... 5,934U.S.A.    ... ... ... ... 349Total14,020 (with 53 field guns and 36 M.Gs.).

The Advance to Peking.During July, the Allied military commanders discussed plans for the advance to Peking. It was generally agreed that a second reverse would do incalculable harm and could not be risked. The British commander (General Gaselee) seems to have been for some time the only advocate of rapid action, but by the 3rd August all had agreed to co-operate.The advance commenced on the 5th August, the international force being composed as follows : Men.

At this stage, the British China Expeditionary Force was organised in 4 Infantry Brigades (2 from India, 2 from home) and 1 Cavalry Brigade, plus ancillary units and L. of C. troops. In round numbers it amounted to .19,000 men, but the Cavalry Brigade and the 3rd and 4th Infantry Brigades were not despatched until August 1900, and of the first two Infantry Brigades, the 2nd was sent to Shanghai.Peking was relieved after considerable fighting on 14th August. More fighting took place inside the City after the relief, but by the lfith August, 1900, the Chinese troops had all melted away.Various minor expeditions were launched from Peking in the Autumn, and hostilities were not at an end until 7th September, 1901.8.
