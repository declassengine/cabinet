&apos;&apos;Tiiis Docuraent is the I;roperty of His Britannic Majesty *s Government.]Copy NOj,C A B I NET.LANDLORD AND TENANT BILL.Ivlemorandum by the Minister of Agriculture.I suggest for consideration whether clause 16 of the Bill Is justified or necessary.As the clause is   drafted it seems to be quite ineffective. No power Is given to dispense with a landlord&apos;s consent, but merely a provision that no fin6 or increased rent may be payable for such consent.It is a common practice in leases to provide that without the landlord&apos;s consent a tenant shall not as the lav/ now stands a landlord may not demand additional rent or a fine (unless the lease contains an express provision to the contrary) for giving his consent in case 1, and by clause 15 (1) of the Bill he is to be prevented from with-holding consent unreasonably.Bxit in cases 2 and 5 he may withhold consent entirely at his own discretion, or he may grant it subject to the payment of a fine or an additional rent .   The effect of clause 16 is merely to deprive the landlord of the power to demand such fine or additional rent, although the tenant may be perfectly agreeable to pay It.   Therefore, if the clause stands he may not b6 -able to obtain such consent, for the landlord would naturally1. Assign or sublet;2. Make any alterations in the structure  (this including improvements);    and3. Use the premises for other than specified purposes.t ake
i 4? 10take this line if he cannot get monetary compensation for the variation of the contract which the tenant has made with him.A case might, and sometimes does, arise where a tenant of a house, together with (say) an acre of garden at a rental of  100 per annum, wishes considerably to enlarge the house, thereby building over part of the garden.   The landlord, taking into account the costs of the improvement, informs the tenant that he will consent to the improvement subject to the rent being increased by (say)  25 -  50 per annum, or to the payment of. a fine of say  200.   It may be that at the end of the tenancy the property is less easily let by reason of the increased size of the house.   The landlord has, however, had the increased rent  (or the fine) in the meantime.   If, however, he Is to receive no increased rent or fine, in cases where he thinks the property, if enlarged will be less liicely to let at the termination of the tenancy, he will naturally refuse his consent to the erection of the improvement .   Instances illustrating, the Ineffectiveness of the clause could be multiplied, but one will suffice to shew the inevitable effect the clause will have in limiting the facilities which tenants at present enjoy of making reasonable improvement to their premises.Similar considerations apply where a landlord might be willing for a consideration bo allow a tenant to turn a private house into a &quot;paying guest&quot; establishment .   The clause merely fetters both landlord and tenant, without giving any advantage to e it her .F .G .linistry of Agriculture and Fisheries . 25th March, 1927-
