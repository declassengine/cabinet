The percentage of unemployment (Great Britain) in the insured industries at the undermentioned dates was March 23, 1925     .... .... .... ....   10&apos;822, 1926     .... .... .... ....    9-521, 1927     .... .... .... ....    9&quot;8 (men only 11&apos;6)It will be seen from Table (A) above that during the four weeks ended 28th March the number of persons registered as unemployed decreased by 87,754. Table (B) shows that the wholly unemployed figure decreased to the extent of 102,682, but that the number of temporary stoppages rose by over 16,000. The total figure for the 28th March, 1927, was still 68,120 more than at the corresponding date last year, but the number of wholly unemployed was almost 10,000 less.(C.) Unemployment in Insured Industries.The latest date for which unemployment figures by industries are available is the 21st March, 1927, at which date the percentage unemployed in Great Britain and Northern Ireland was 9&quot;9, as compared with 10&apos;9 at the 21st February, 1927, with 9&apos;8 at the 22nd March, 1926, and with 11*1 at the 23rd March, 1925. The figures at the 21st March, 1927, in respect of industries showing appreciable variations in unemployment during the month, together with the increase or decrease as compared with the previous month, with the 26th April, 1926, and with a year ago are given in the table below : Industry.

The adverse movement in this industry is accounted for by a rise in the temporary stoppage figure due to increased short time working. The number of wholly unemployed miners decreased by over 13,000. The set back is chiefly evident in the Midlands, and would appear to have been caused by a falling off in the home demand for coal. This is, doubtless, partly attributable to seasonal causes, and reports from the various centres indicate that the ground lost is not likely to ,be regained for the next few months at least, unless a further expansion in export trade takes place.A considerable part of the reduction in unemployment whioh was shared by the other insured industries is again seasonal in nature. The improvement in building and in clothing trades was somewhat more marked than in March of last year. It is satisfactory to note that a further recovery took place in the heavy metal industries, although this was not so extensive as during the preceding
(D.) Latest Figures.The latest figure of unemployment published is that for the 18th April, giving the total number on the registers as 1,106,400. This is an increase over the position on the 28th March amounting to 24,671, and an increase over a year ago of 109,754.ARTHUR STEEL-MAITLAND.Ministry of Labour,April 26, 1927.month. Some anxiety is felt as to future prospects in the iron and steel trades once the orders which accumulated during the coal strike have been completed. The shipbuilding prospects are somewhat more satisfactory, the amount of tonnage under construction at the end of March being 1,216,932 tons, or 456.848 tons more than that being built at the end of December last. While a further improvement in the cotton industry was shown during the month, later reports indicate that this industry is about to experience another relapse, particularly in the American spinning section. Orders do not appear to be coining in to the extent anticipated, and a considerable amount of short time working may be expected in certain centres. In the Egyptian section the position is more satisfactory.While the number of persons unemployed is greater than at this time last year the employment position in most of the staple industries, with the exception of coal mining, is more satisfactory. All the textile trades except hosiery show an appreciable improvement. The percentage of unemployment in the ship-building industry has fallen by 7&apos;7 per cent., in the iron and steel industry by 4&apos;7 per cent., and in tin plate manufacture by 8 1 percent. In general engineering the position is much the same, but unemployment in marine engineering has decreased by 5&quot;2 per cent. Besides coal mining, unemployment is considerably higher in building, public works contracting, &amp;c, but the position in the last two industries will probably show some improvement in the near future.
