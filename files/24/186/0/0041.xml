Printed fcr the Cabinet.   May 1927.3oCHINA.I CIRCULATE to the Cabinet Air. Mounsey&apos;s account of a conversation with Mr. Rausome of the &quot; Manchester Guardian,&quot; who has just returued from Shaughai.Mr. Ransome is a shrewd observer. I accept only with considerable qualifications his estimate of Russian influence and policy, but 1 have myself felt the change which he describes in the attitude of the community at Shanghai since the arrival of the troops, and from other sources I have had confirmation of the fact that that attitude and the utterances of the British press in China constitute a real obstacle to the establishment of those friendly relations with the Chinese, which it is the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government to promote.One may admit that in face of such constant, provocation this impatience is natural; but the Cabinet, in considering reports from Shaughai, must bear in mind the local feeling and remember that the wish is widespread among the local community to turn the force which His Majesty&apos;s Government sent only for their protection to quite other uses.I think it right to insist upon these facts since it is clear that whatever instructions as to reprisals we give to the men on the spot will be read by them not in the calm atmosphere of London, where they are all framed, but in the heat and excitement of Shanghai, where other views and purposes prevail, and that these instructions must therefore be all the more carefully and precisely framed.A. C.Foreign Office, May 6, 1927.Record of Conversation between Mr. Mounsey and Mr. Ransome, of the&quot; Manchester Guardian.&quot;Sir V. Wellesley.The following are notes of a conversation I had this morning with Mr. Arthur Ransome, who has just returned from a visit to China on behalf of the &quot; Manchester Guardian.&quot; I was fully prepared to find him much biassed in favour of the more extreme elements of the Chinese movement, but am bound to say that, except on one or two points, I found his views moderate and not unsound. He maintained the view expressed in these articles that Borodin himself exercised a moderating influence on the extremists and wished the Hankow Agreement signed, though he omitted to give what we believe to have been the reason for this attitude, viz., the desire to consolidate his position before further adventures were undertaken.Mr. R ansome is clearly a believer in the Kuo Min-tang as the one hopeful influence in China&apos;s future ; but he is not, I gather, a believer in any of its present individual leaders, and he was rather emphatic in warning us against getting involved with or committed to any individual in China. He declares the Kuo Min-tang influence is almost as strong in the North as in the South, and is the one force to be reckoned with throughout China.Mr. Ransome&apos;s main conclusion seemed to be, so far as Anglo-Chinese relations are concerned, that they will never improve so long as the Shanghai &quot; atmosphere &quot; lasts, and he is convinced that it will ouly be after Shanghai has had a good knock in one way or another that it will modify its traditionally truculent, overbearing and irritating attitude to the Chinese.While he was at Shanghai this atmosphere was ,visibly growing. Before the despatch of our defence force Shanghai had resigned itself to acceptance of the Hankow Agreement and to granting considerable concessions to Chinese demands in Shanghai itself. The arrival of the troops completely changed all this, and Shanghai 3969   [16125]CONFIDENTIAL. [F 4454/2/10]O.P. 142 (27).
is determined not to cede an inch in concessions in the settlement and to bring about a revision of the Hankow Concession Agreement. According to Mr. Ransome, Sir S. Barton himself encourages this attitude, and is mainly concerned in trying to give the Southern Government some kind of slap in the face. He was so convinced that they would never sign a Hankow Concession Agreement that he hoped their failure to do so would have provided the desired opportunity.Meanwhile the Shanghai British press and community have been warning their own and the Chinese public not to take the Foreign Office statements of policy too literally; these statements represented only their &quot; winter policy,&quot; which would be considerably modified when the Yang-tsze rose, and the world would then see what the British Government could and would do.This sort of propaganda is all the more embarrassing, mischievous and dangerous if it is true, as I have been previously assured by Dr. Balme, a very unprejudiced leading missionary in Northern China, that he found his Chinese friends (i.e., the pro-British element) quite unimpressed by our statements of policy in December and January, which they regarded as repetitions, quite uncalled for at that time, of empty words until they heard of the signature of the Hankow Concession Agreement, when it began dimly to occur to them that this time we might be really embarking on some new and more liberal policy.However, we have done our best here, through the China Committee, and through our officials in China, to moderate this Shanghai attitude, without success. Mr. Ransome tells me that the Shanghai British community are not only aggressive to the Chinese, but consistently hostile to and critical of the British Government.Mr. Ransome readily admitted that our defence force was, as things turned ou reqttired on the spot to keep order and prevent outrages; but he said that even the Chinese, who welcomed its presence, considered it was much too large a force for the purpose ; and they are now complaining more and more of the tactless way in which its barbed wire and other defensive measures are ostentatiously hampering tride and inconveniencing communications and traffic. Sand-bags and barbed wire have, he says, been responsible for several of our sailors&apos; incidents with Chinese coolies. At Kiukiang, for instance, our barbed wire was so arranged as to prevent Chinese access to their own custom house.Mr. Ransome complained of the Shanghai propaganda, which has worked up a most dangerous situation, produced a general sense of uncertainty, anxiety and suspicion on all sides and among all elements, and which is so WeU&quot;organised and active that, the moment our troops, arrived, thinking innocently that they were there to keep a neutral attitude in a civil war, it convinced them that the South was the enemy to go for and the North their best friends.G. MOUNSEY.May 2, 1927.
