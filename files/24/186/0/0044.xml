THIS JX)OULIJ5NT IS THE PgOggggY OP HIS BEITAENIIviAJ 5TYTS GOVS5BM3N0?.0 A B IE E I. MiL4 J JMM2L IE THE OOiuL TEA IDE. Memorandum by the Minister of^Lj&amp;bour.3035?. COPY NO.J? )TP.145(27)1.     In December lest I indicated to the Cabinet in Memorandum H.O.C. (36) 97 that, while it was   impossible to m-ike any close estimate of the number of coal miners likely to be permanently unemployed as a result of the changed circumstances of the Mining Industry, it was the general view of those who had studied the question that it could hardly be hoped that the number would be less than 100,000, while it might be as high as 200,000 or even m-ire. 2.     According to the latest figures available - those for the 25th April - there were 1,025,236 wage earners on the books of colliery companies.     At the same date, the Unemployment Insurance statistics showed 113,993 men (or 9.3?o of the number insured) as wholly unemployed and. 104,377 men (or 8*5ju) as temporarily stopped from work.     As at certain collieries men will have been working short time who were at work on the days to which the &quot;temporarily stopped&quot; figures relate, it is certain that at least 218,370 men (or 17.8$) of the industry were either partially or wholly unemployed at the end of the third week in April. Between the end of the stoppage and the third week of March, there were never less than 120,000 men recorded on the books of the Employment Exchanges as wholly unemployed though in the third week of April, a month later, the figure for wholly unemployed men had, as stated, fallen to 113,993./On
On the other hand, the total number of men on the colliery books has remained fairly steady in the last few weeks, although there is a disturbing increase in the amount of short-time working, and there are indications that the position may become a good deal worse.3.     The situation still remains very unsettled and I am not in a position to amend my estimate of December last as to the number of men likely to prove surplus to the needs of the Goal Mining industry as it adapts itself to altered conditions.     The present figures may of course be adversely effected if the policy which the French Government are reported to be considering for the restriction of coal imports into France should be adopted.4.     I am in negotiation with the Mining Association and the Miners1 Federation with regard to the arrangements to be made under Section 18 of the Mining Industry Act, 1926, to prevent the introduction into the mines of men not hitherto employed in the Coal Industry.     The Miners1 Federation still have under consideration the proposals which have been provisionally accepted in principle by the coal owners, under which the Employment Exchanges will be given a period of fourteen days to recruit coal miners from other parts of the country before the owners are free to engage new entrants.     Restriction of recruitment, however, can have little effect on the general emplpymsnt situation.5.     The eventual petition as to surplus, lebour in the ooal tro.de is far fro?* clear, arid it is difficult to say whether any action by the Government is possible.     The extent of the surplus will depend on the demand for coal at home and/overseas,
overseas, and on the power of the labour market outside the coal industry to absorb part of the redundant labour in mines.     In any ease the number of unemployed canDot but be large.     I think it is ri^ht to oall the attention of my colleagues to the situation, since there ie the likelihood that we shall have tho usual cry raised that the Government has Tno polioy&apos;, a cry which, however unfair, is always damaging.     Mr. Cruniy, M.P. has indeed tabled a motion for discussion on 18th May on unemployment in the coal industry. As it is sec*nd order it is unlikely to be reached, but it is indicative of attention becoming focussed on the subject.(Intd.) A.S.- M.Mini  try of.Jj.abour. l^Jb-may.. 1? 87.
