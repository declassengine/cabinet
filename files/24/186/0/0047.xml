CP. 148 (27) CABINET. --TEE SUPREME TRIEUlTALS  fADDITIONAL JUDGES) COMMITTED c &quot;REPORT.1. At their meeting on Kerch 9th, 1927 (&quot;Cabinet 15(27)Conclusion 15; the Cabinet agreed that a Committee composed of -The Lord Chencellor The lord President of the Council The Secretary of State for India The Attorney general in consultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer or his representative on the financial aspects of the question, should meet to consider whether it Is necessary to appoint any additional judges in the House of Lords or the JudicialCommittee of the Privy Council.2o As requested by the Cabinet the Committee have considered a Memorandum submitted to the Prime Minister by Yiseount Haldsne of Cloano      In this Memorandum Lord Haldane,  after reviewing the present and future position as regards the volume of judicial work falling upon the House of Lords and the Judicial Committee, expressed the view thet the number of judges available is ir^eequste to enable these Tribunals properly to discharge their functions, end proposed that legislation should be introduced authorising the addition of two paid Law Lords to the judicial strength, in addition to the two Indian appointments to the Judiclel Committee proposed by the Judicial Committee Bill of 1926.      The Committee have also had before them a Memorandum by the Lord President of the Council emphasizing the neoessity from the Imperial point of view of maintaining the prestige of the Judicial Committee.
3. The Committee have satisfied themselves thrtthe ccse for en increase of the number of Lev? Lords has not been established.      Lord Haldsne has under-estimeted the number cf judges whose services rre aveilrble for the work of the Supreme Tribuncls, that work is in no way in arreer   and no real difficulty is experienced in making arrangements for deeling with reasonable prcptitude with \&apos;j *^-ils to the Eouse of Lords and the Judicial Committee.      Retirements of two Taw Lords in the near future will enable appointments to be mode which will go far to meet criticism directed to the high average age of the present members of the Tribunals.-4.        While the Committee sec no justification infor an  increase present circumstances An the number cf Law Lords, theyare unanimously agreed on the urgent necessity fortheaddition to the Judicial Committee of two Indian Members,and they accordingly recommend the reintrsauctionforthwith of the Judicial Committee Bill with a viow toits passage into law with the least possible delay.5. A copy of the Bill as passed by the House ofLords last     year    is attached-      The Committee suggestthat before reintroduction it should bo modified inthe following respects -fa) Under Clause 1(4) as at present drafted the two new members must retire on attaining the age of 72.    The Committee favour the insertion of an age limit in the Bill, tut -foel that a fixed limit of 72 is in the circumstances too low, and that it would be preferable while regaining this age in the Bill, to give the Appointing Authority discretion to extend the age limit to 75 in particular cases.
(b) Under the Bill as drafted the two additions! appointments art- unpen-sionable end when the Bill was before the House of Commons in1926, the Attorney-G^n^ral gave en assurance that suitably qualified persons could be found to fill the posts in an unponsioncble capacity.      The Committee consider, however that it is in the public. Interest that these posts should not be subjected to any disability In this respectM and1 they accordingly recommend that a clause should be Inserted in the Bill empowering the -Appointing Authority, with the consent of the Treasury, to grant pensions to the two additional membersr the pensions fso far es they are charged on British funds) to bo based on the salaries payable under Clause lf3) out of the Consolidated Jund o(ei The Committee think that the present opportunity should be taken to remove altogether the existing limitation of the number   (seven) of Dominion members of the Judicial Committee prescribed by the  Judicial Committee Amendment Act 1895 as amended by the Appellate Jurisdiction Acts 1908 and 1913, and so to facilitate the future representation of the Dominions, Including the Irish Free State,  on the Judicial Committee This could bos effected by the insertion of a clause In the Bill after consultation and in agreement with the Domihlonso6o The attention of the Committee has been directed tothe somewhat inadequate and unsatisfactory character of the aoeommodati on at present provided for tb o Judicial Committee In Treasury Chambers.      The Committee have.. Invl3e the lord President of the Council to confer with the First Commissioner of Works on a suggestionthat the Judicial Committee should in future be accommodated within the precincts of Westminster Hallo7. The Committee submit the following recommendations to the Cabinet -(a) That a case for increasing the number of paid Law Lords as suggested by Lord Hsldane has not been established and that accordingly the proposal
is not one that &quot;they can recommend tho Cabinet to entertain at tho prosent time.lb)    That it is desirable that the Judicial CommittooBill 1926 amended as follows should bo rointroduced and passed into law with as little delay as possible(1) Clause 1(4) to bs modified so as to provide that the retiring age shall be 72 with power to extend to 75 at the discretion of the Appointing Authority.,(2) A provision to ho inserted in tho Billempowering tbo Appointing Authority with the consent of the Treasury to grant to the two additional members of the Judicial Committoo on their retirement owing to illness or old age pensions based (so far as British funds are concerned) on the salaries payable undor Clause 1(3) out of the Consolidated Fond.(3) Subject to the concurrence&quot;&quot;of the Dominions,, a provision to be inserted in the Bill abolishing the present maximum limitation on the number (seven) of Dominion members of the Judicial Committee prescribed by the Judicial Committee Amendment Act 1895 as amended by the Appellate Jurisdiction Acts 1908 and 1913.Signed on   behalf of the Committee CAVE Chairman,House of Lords,12th Hay,1927.
