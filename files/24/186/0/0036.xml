POCUjbSKT IS THE property OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNLaNT.C A 3 I N S T.Copy No. 30_WASHINGTON    HOURS    CONVENTION.iiemorandum by the lviinister of Labour.(27)        1.     At the meeting of the Cabinet on 9th March theCabinet agreed that the La*? Officers should be consulted on the possibility of reconciling the provisions of the Coal alines Acts with regard to hours of work with the provisions of the Washington Convention.      It will be remembered that the difficulty was that, while Section I of the Coal iiines Act, 19Q8, provides that the hours of the workman below ground are not to exceed eight per day, it goes on to recognise the impossibility of applying this to each individual workman of a shift, and to interpret it in.such a way as to exclude 30th winding times from the calculation, with the result tnat,   while the average time worked is a shift plus one -finding time, the maximum hours for which it is at present legally permissible for any workman in a shift to be below ground exceed 8 hours by the length of time that it taices both to lower and raise the whole shift.2.      Two questions  arise on this.     First,   can the Act as it stands be regarded as sufficient compliance with the Washington Convention?     Secondly,  if the answer to this is in the negative, is it legitimate to take as the basis the average time actually worked by the men in a shift instead of the maximum permissible time?     Obviously,, few, if, any, of them work the maximum permissible tins:    on/ave rage
average they are he low ground from the middle of the-winding down to the middle of the winding up, i.e., in an 8 hour pit, for 8 hours plu3 one binding time. It appears on examination that if rest periods were excluded, as is provided for by the Convention, and if half the total winding times instead of the whole were taken into account, it would be possible for the great majority of coal mines to comply with the requirements of the Convention without any further alteration of practice than would be involved in notifying the length of their rest periods.3.     The Law Officers were accordingly asked whether the Act as it stands is a sufficient compliance with the Convention, and, if not, whether it was permissible to calculate the time for which the workman below ground is &quot;at the disposal of the employer&quot; (to quote the words of the London Agreement) on the average time actually worked by the men in each shift instead of the maximum permissible time of each individual workman.     Their answer to the first question is understood to be in the negative, but they have expressed the opinion, having regard in particular to the terms of the French text, that the spirit of the Convention is satisfied if the average actual time below ground of all men in a shift does not exceed 48 hours a week.      They think, however, that it would be imprudent to ratify the Convention until it had been agreed between the countries concerned that the expression &quot;time during -vhioh the persons employed are at the disposal of the employer&quot; means, in the case of shift workers in coal mines, the average time of all men employed in the shift.
4.     The countries concerned in the London Agreeinent are, besides ourselves, Belgium, Prance, Germany and Italy.     In view of the actual terms of their texts of the Convention, which differ slightly from the English text, and in view of the conditions of work in all European coal mines, there is little doubt that this is the interpretation /?hich they put on the Convention, and there should be no difficulty in obtaining their concurrence in due course. 5.     Under the proposal, there will still remain a certain number of pits, the precise extent of which cannot at rresent be estimated,  working 8 hours and having long winding times, ,?hich would not be able even by this method of calculation to comply with the requirements.      in these pits either the winding time would have to be reduced or, in so far as this was impracticable or did not prove sufficient, some reduction of the time underground would have to be made. 6.      I propose now to proceed with the action contemplated in the First Interim Report of the Committee on the Y/ashington Hours Convention and approved by the Cabinet on 9th March, namely, to consult the employers&apos; representatives, privately, using as a basis of discussion the main points contained in the Draft Bill as approved by the Cabinet with the inclusion of a clause on the lines of the Law Officers&apos; opinion, and I will report their views to the Cabinet.(Intd.)
