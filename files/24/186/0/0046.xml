Se aloThe upshot of the Cabinet decision last month was that the representatives of the hereditary peerage ought to be reduced to 150 cr 100, being a half or a third of the new Second Chamber, that they should be combined with a number of lords of Parliament nominated by - he Crown, and that in return for this fundamental change in the constitution of the House their powers should be increased by a bstter definition of Money Bills under a more impartial authority and the removal of the House of Commons privilege as to Rateso     It appeared also that the majority of the Cabinet were in favour of putting the powers of the Second Chamber,, however they may be settled, outside the provisions of the Parliament Act, and some colleagues advocated putting legislation by regulation -commonly called DORA - similarly outside the provisions of tho Parliament Act*    I do not propose to discuss the possibility of this last proposal though the difficulties of drafting such a limitation are evidently very formidableo    The broad fact remains that in -the tpinion of the majority of my colleague no attempt is to be made to deal 7/ith a deadlock between the two Houses - that is to say at a time when millions of untried electors are to be added to the register no attempt is to bs made to restore to the House of Lords the power to arrest legislation which they know to be contrary to the wishes of the people.I cannot help thinking that my colleagues hardly had
in mind the extent to which we are already committed on this question.     In June 1924 the leader of the Pe/further now Prime Minister - havjng consultea those who are his present colleagues in the Government wrote a Foreword to the booklet entitled&quot;3fjOOking Ahsad&quot;in which he said ; ITWe have also endeavoured to reduce the Unionist position into the more concise, shape of a paragraphed statement of our views&quot;, and on page 12 the relevant paregraph runs as follows :-&quot;The Unionist Party hold unswervingly -&amp;o the conviction that the existence of an effective Second Ghamhsr is essential for the purpose of securing a revision of hastily prepared measures and of safeguarding the considered Judgment of the people.    It recognises that the establishment of en effective Second Chamber mesas a reconsider atlon of the composition and powers of the House of Lords..This was shortly before the last General Election and in the course of the Election the Prime Minister said % wso I think It is our duty to consider within the framework of the Parliament Act whether it Is practicable to make provision in the machinery of the Second Chamber for preserving the ultimate authority in legislation of the considered judgment of the people.&quot; ,It is of course clear that only the objective of bur Party on this subject was defined and that the only^
promise given was th et its practicability would be considered.     But on the other hard there is no question of the character of the issuvwhich was in contemplation.      There was in these utterances no reference to Money Bills or Rating Powers or even to the exemption from the mischief of the Parliament Act of the Bouse of lords itself.    The objective defined by these passages is the preservation of &quot;the ultimate authority in legislation to the consl cored judgment of the people.    It was both before the Election and at th e liection that to this issae the attention of the country was directed..Last Summer a great deputation from both Houses of Parliament met the Prime Minister and hiss colleagues.    Sir Robert Sanders speaking for his Committee represented among other things that there was an overwhelming opinion In favour of some kind of reference to the people in case of deadlocks Lord Midleton speaking in t-urn for his Committee stipulated for an amendment of the Parliament Act so that drastic changes cannot be carried through&quot;&apos;without the will of the people being clearly ascertained-To this deputation the Prime Minister repeated the pledge that we shall deal with House of Lords reform in the lifetime of the present Parliaraento    It is per-\perfectly true that he did not promise to deal withVdeadlock??\\but only with the general question of the amendme-J^t of the Parliament Act, which as we know includes othes: points besides deadlocks.       But at any rate he\ did nothing to modify the announcement
already made at the Election that the aspiration of the Conservative Party was by means of the Second Chamber to secure upon matters of the first Importance the considered judgment of the people.     In addition he told the deputation that a Cabinet Committee was dealing iwlth the question of I-Iouse of Lords Reform and a few months later he atithorisod the Lord Chancellor to meet the Committees of the two Houses in whose name Sir Robert Sanders and Lord ridleton had spoken, and to inform them of the tenor of the Report of the Cabinet Committee, though of course expressly subject to the saving clause that this Report had not then been considered by the cabinet     I need not say that by far the most important finding of that Report --was in favoiu&apos; of a method.of safe-guarding the considered judgment of the people.     Finally quite recently the Committee of the Peers were informed that the Cabinet were considering definite resolutions.I do not suggest for a moment that any pledge has been given to deal with deadlocks, but there is no question that this Is the objective which the Party at the Election contem-plated and announced;    there Is no question that the Party by Its organised assemblies has re-affirmed it over and over again almost unanimously-    there is no question that nothing has been said up to this moment on behalf of the Government to indicate that they had abandoned the attempt;    and lastly,, there is no question as to the views of the majority of the Cabinet Committee which were communicated by the Lord Chancellor to the Committee of tho Lords,,     I was not
present on this last occasion because I was abroad but if I had been in England I should, of coui*S6, have shared the Lord Chancellor^ responsibility,,     Indeed, my opinion on this head is notorious,,I think after the recital of this history the Cabinet will realise in   what a position they stand in respect of this matteru     There Is no suggestion, I repeat, of the breaking of any pledge, but at this time of day to ask the Peers to embark upon the admittedly risky experiment of abandoning the deeply rooted hereditary character of the House, in order to carry a reform which falls very far short of the issue submitted by the Party to the electors and never vrithdrawn by the Government ,would be a formidable taskc     Par the Lord Chancellor and myself, whose opinions are well known and wer-e formally announced to the Peers Committee no longer ago than . last Autumn - though I can only speak for myself - It is a task from which as my colleagues will understand we must very naturally shrinks,     For the Cabinet this change of policy would be damaging, but for us it would not only be damaging but also ridiculous - which in politics is really conclusive,,May 10th, 1927&apos;0
