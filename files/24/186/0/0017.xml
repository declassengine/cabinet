v. 1 rj ni1 j u(THIS DOGUiIENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BBITAITUIO MAJESTY&apos;S GOYERMJENT) . SECRET. MCP..  118  (27) .Copy No.SOUSB 0? 10 HPS KSW.   aerorandtua; &quot;by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.Host of the discussion of this question has proceeded on the basis that the greatest danger to be feared is an abuse of the powers of tho House of Commons under ohe Parliament Act, e.g., by forcing through some measure akin to D.O.3.A. which would enable the nationalization of industries to be carried through by a series of executive decrees.      My own belief, fortified by what has happened in the last few years in Queensland and Hew South Wales, is that a Labour Government,  controlled from outside by a wholly irresponsible caucus, will not be content to acquiesce in the delays and restrictions involved in the procedure of the Parliament Act, but will go directly for the swamping of the Upper House, both in order to pass any measure that it may be interested in, and also to abolish the Upper Eouse itself.      In Queensland that has been actually clone.      In Hew South Wales it was all but done, and only the personal obstinacy of the Governor stands between the Upper House and its extinction.      To ask the Sovereign to undertake a similar role, possibly in the face of threats of revolutionary disturbance from the extremists, is throwing a wholly unfair responsibility upon him.Tho essential thing therefore, before anything else, is to replace- a chamber which can bo swamped or extinguished within the forms of the Constitution, by one whose numbers and method of selection and replacement are fixed beforehand.      Theoretically this
ol acould be done by a mere limitation of numbers, the new House of Lords being simply elected by the existing Peers out of their oral number,      The practical objection to this solution is that it leaves the new House of Lords as one-sided as the old, and while it is so public opinion would neither favour any change in the Parliament Act or stand behind the House  of Lords In a crisiso The only safe course is to create a Second Chamber which, while retaining as much as possible of continuity with the old, is based on methods of selection which are not open to Government manipulati&amp;n, and, while essentially conservative as against revolutionary change, preserves a reasonable balance of parties and can therefore,  in a crisis, command the sympathy of the general public. The scheme of the Lord Chancellor?s Committee affords the basis  of such a Second Chamber.    Bat to prevent it being one-sided the proportion of hereditary peers should be still further reduced, and care would have to be taken to give the other parties from the start a substantial proportion of the nominated members.    The suggestion I would put  forward is 100 hereditary peers, 100 elected by County Councils, and 100 nominated, the nominations being by the Government and Oppositions in the proportion of the votes cast at the preceding General Election. On that basis the Opposition parties would start off with something like 120 out of 300 and could elways hope to improve their position.This is. I believe, the least measure of change in the composition of the House of Lords which would justify any serious modification of the Pcrliament Act.    For my own part, if this change
could be secured, I would &quot;be prepared to accept the minor modifications already suggested, and postpone the question of insisting on an intervening election or referendum, until such tine as actual experience had convinced the nation both of the dangers of the Parliament Act and of the reasonable impartiality and judgment of the reformed House of Lords.Two objections have been raised to so far-reaching a changeo      One is that this is creating a new-fangled Senate in place of the House of Lords to which the country is accustomed.     I think it is easy to exaggerate the extent of the change in the character of the assembly.,     The County Council representatives would certainly contain a large proportion of men who were already oeers or at any rate of  the same type, i0e0 large landowners or business men who have taken an active interest in local affairs.       The nominated members would include many who were already peers or who would probably^ be made peers at the end of their  time,The other objection is  that we shall be Plunging into a desperate constitutional conflict cutting across all other issues.    . It is orobable that the proposals of the Lord Chancellor&apos;s Committee with regard to the Parliament Act would encounter fierce opposition, and possible^ from many Liberals as well as from the Labour Party,,      They certainly could not be carried without going at least as far in the direction of reform as I have suggested.      But the reform of the House of Lords in itself will encounter no effective opposition^ even if our opponents discuss it disdainfully as inadequate, while it will, I think, create real enthusiasm in our own Party-      The one thing our Par-ty is always hungering for is initiative and
bold action on our own lines. What dispirits them inaction, or the mild imitation of the oolicy of our opponent s.LDominions Office,
