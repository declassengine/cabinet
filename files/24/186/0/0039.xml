SECRET.Copy No.30CP. 140 (27).CABINET.REPRESENTATION IN THE DOMINIONS OF HIS MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT IN GREAT BRITAIN.Memorandum circulated by the Lord President of the Council, the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and the Secretary ofState for Dominion Affairs.OUR colleagues will recollect that the Imperial Conference approved the following Resolution (previously approved by the Cabinet, see Cabinet 59 (26), Conclusion 2), which was submitted to it by the Inter-Imperial Relations Committee : &quot; The Governments represented at the Imperial Conference are impressed with the desirability of developing a system of personal contact, both in London and in the Dominion capitals, to supplement the present system of inter-communication and the reciprocal supply of information on affairs requiring joint consideration. The manner in which any new system is to be worked out is a matter for consideration and settlement between His Majesty&apos;s Governments in Great Britain and the Dominions, with due regard to the circumstances of each particular part of the Empire, it being understood that any new arrangements should be supplementary to, and not in replacement of, the system of direct communication from Government to Government and the special arrangements which have been in force since 1918 for communications between Prime Ministers.&quot;It will be noted that the Resolution refers to the need of a system of personal contact at both ends. That system has always been regarded as normal, and indeed indispensable, in the conduct of business with. Foreign Powers. There is an obvious danger of misunderstandings arising from direct telegraphic or written communication unless translated into, or accompanied by, personal communication by some one in contact with the Government concerned, and able to adapt his language to the personality with which he is dealing or to explain ambiguities in the light of his knowledge of the general policy of the Government which he represents. There is an obvious advantage, too, in the alternative channels of communication afforded by a personal representative at both ends. Some communications are best made by the Foreign Secretary to the Ambassador here ; others are more suitably sent to our Ambassador for action at his end ; the character of the individual representatives and Foreign Ministers must also largely influence the choice of the channel employed. These considerations apply with almost equal force to inter-Imperial communications, and although none of the Governments concerned wish to do away with the existing system of direct telegraphic or written correspondence, we have all realised the need for supplementing it by some more personal form of contact at both ends.As far as the London end is concerned the Dominions are already represented by their High Commissioners. The functions of the High Commissioners cover a wide field, including not only finance, trade and migration, but also in many cases defence and representation at the League of Nations, and in respect of all these matters they act as intermediaries for and with their Governments and have access to the Ministers concerned in this country. A further development has taken place since the Imperial Conference, on the lines of the above-quoted Resolution, by arrangements which have heen put in force with the approval of the Dominion Governments, for communicating to the High Commissioners, for their personal perusal, copies of the secret Foreign[16097]
Office prints, which are sent weekly to the Dominion Prime Ministers, and of telegrams to the Dominions on foreign affairs. The High Commissioners will thus be in a position, if and when either their own Governments or the Government here wish to utilise them for the discussion of issues of Empire policy, to take part in such discussion, or to act as a supplementary channel of communication, with a reasonable knowledge of the situation. The extent to which they are thus utilised will be primarily a matter for the determination of each Government, and all that His Majesty&apos;s Government in Great Britain can do is to continue to make clear its readiness to meet the wishes of the Dominion Governments in the fullest measure, lu this respect the lead to the other Governments is being given by Australia which has already for the last two years been represented by a special liaison officer, who will presumably be available in future as an expert assistant to the High Commissioner on questions of general Imperial policy.In the Dominions there is no representation of His Majesty&apos;s Government iu Great Britain corresponding to the representation in London of His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ments in the Dominions. As the Report of the Inter-Imperial Relations Committee pointed out, the Governor-General has long since ceased to be in any sense the representative of His Majesty&apos;s Government in Great Britain. In future he is not even to act as a post office in the transmission of official communications. The very nature of his office precludes him from championing British interests as such, or of intervening with Government Departments on behalf of British traders, investors or immigrants. In fact, there is in the Dominions no authority charged with the duty of protecting the general interests of Great Britain or the ppecial interests and claims of British subjects domiciled in or connected with this country-. There are, it is true, Trade Commissioners, but their functions are in no way comparable to those of Dominion High Commissioners in London or of His Majesty&apos;s Consuls in foreign countries. Nor are there any representatives, senior or junior, who coidd serve as channels for the personal communication of views between the Government here and the Dominion Governments.Quite apart from the Imperial Conference Resolution and the strong views iu favour of British representation in the Dominions expressed by Mr. Mackenzie King and other Dominion Prime Ministers, we are convinced by our practical day to day experience that the absence of such representation is a serious weakness in our system of inter-Imperial contact. To take one example only, the hurrying up of replies to communications on urgent matters, such as for instance President Coolidge&apos;s recent proposals for a Conference on the Limitation of Naval Armaments, is something which can be done more easily through a personal interview at the other end than in any-other way. Our personal knowledge of the Prime Ministers concerned has also led us to the conclusion that, in some Dominions at any rate, the development of personal contact at this end is not likely to advance seriously unless it is accompanied or preceded by machinery&apos; for personal contact at the Doniinion end. A further reason for coming to some decision on this matter has been provided, since the Imperial Conference, by the appointment by the United States of diplomatic representatives of high standing and marked ability at Ottawa and Dublin.The form which such representation should take must necessarily depend on the varying circumstances of the different Dominions and upon the point of view of the several Governments. It does not follow that because the representation of the various interests, economic and political, of a Dominion in London is entrusted to a single High Commissioner, there must be a British High Commissioner in that Dominion. It is always possible to divide the function of liaison officer on Imperial Policy from that of the representative of British economic and personal interests, and the case for dealing with each function can be decided separately on its merits. In the case of Canada, Mr. Mackenzie King has made it clear, both at the Imperial Conference and since his return to Canada, that what he would favour is the appointment of a High Commissioner representing Great Britain at Ottawa in the same manner as the Canadian High Commissioner represents his Dominion in London. The Governor-General in private correspondence &quot;has repeatedly emphasised the same point of view, and, so far from feeling that his own position might be impaired by such an appoint-ment, has urged that the British High Commissioner should be some one of the highest standing and of striking personality, more particularly in view of the appointment of an American Minister. In the case of Australia Mr. Bruce is much more interested in securing effective personal contact at this end, and while, no doubt, quite willing to have a British liaison officer or to see a Commissioner on the economic side with wider powers than the present Trade Commissioner, would probably deprecate the
appointment of a full-fledged High Commissioner, to which Lord Stonehaven has, in his letters, expressed himself as strongly opposed from the point of view of its effect on the authority of the Governor-General. In South. Africa the position is complicated by the fact that the Governor-General is already &quot; High Commissioner,&quot; and as such concerned with the administration of the native territories as well as possessing certain limited functions in relation to Southern Rhodesia. It would not be desirable to alter this arrangement, at any rate during Lord Athlone&apos;s teuure of office, though there would be no difficulty in the creation either of a political liaison officer or of an &quot; Agent-General &quot; or improved Trade Commissioner. Tn -the case of the Irish Free State, while Ministers at the Conference warmly endorsed Mr. Mackenzie King&apos;s suggestion, the Governor-General has privately urged that the appointment of anything like a High Commissioner would he open to suspicion, for the present at any rate, as a new British device for reasserting our ascendency over the Free State Government, and his view has not been affected by the appointment of an American Minister to Dublin. New Zealand has already indicated, through Mr. Coates, that it desires only the attachment of an officer from the Foreign Office to the Dominion Department of External Affairs.While the views of the Dominions concerned have naturally to be taken into account, the - decision on the matter of British representation in the Dominions is primarily one for His Majesty&apos;s Government in Great Britain. If, as we believe, such representation is really needed, in one form or another, in most of the Dominions, it is for us to take the initiative in opening negotiations with the Dominion Governments, basing ourselves upon the Imperial Conference resolution. We do not wish at the moment to formulate any detailed proposals. All that we ask is to have the authority of the Cabinet to work out, in consultation with other Ministers concerned, and with the Dominion Governments, schemes for the representation of Great Britain in the Dominions suitable to the circumstances of each Dominion. Every such scheme would of course, be submitted in advance for Cabinet approval.B.A. O. L. S. A.May 3, 1927.
