KlffBIffHTT&quot;I am quite clear - after reading all the telegrams which have reached ne to-day - that such instructions cannot be issuad now.       I an not at all sure that they ought ever to bo issued;   but this question can be better decided later.The first step is to secure agreement on the answer to Chen.Assuming that that brings no satisfaction from him and that the Nationalist Government is still at Hankow,- I hold that Hankow is the proper plaoe for reprisals - all the more so because the Japanese are deeply engaged at Hankow.But in truth time is essential to enable us to see (l) what is the attitude of the new Japanese Government, (2) what is the attitude of the United States Government (3) what is the immediate result of the struggle (a) between Borodin cum Chen and Chiang, and (b) between North and South.Of the new proposals from the Chiefs of Staffs I would say at present only(1)  they are a complete reversal of our present policy, especially as regards the dispersal of military force.    The Chiefs of Staffs have hitherto insisted that the Shanghai Defence Force should be used for defensive and protective purposes only in one specified area.     It was not contemplated
that these &quot;troops would bo used elsewhere or bo placed at the disposal of any naval, or other authority to carry out reprisals all over China.(2) they would take all centre! of tho situation completely out of the hands of the homo authorities.    For, in order to bo effective,  the Instructions issued to the naval and military authorities must give them a very free hand, and enable them to act at once on their own judgment.(3) as a substitute for the application of sanctions to enforce the Elanking demands they soeic of doubtful efficacy for:(a) if firing ceases on the Chinese side we will be no roarer to gjtting satisfaction for those demands;(b) if seme measure of satisfaction isaonceded to those demands,  but firing on the Yangtse or elsewhere continues, we are still faced with the question how to deal with that firing;(o) as firing is unlikely to be in thefuture, any more than in the past, confined to tho parsons or parties who were guilty of the Sanking outrages, our reprisals must pre-sumably be equally directed to any other parties firing on us who had nothing to do with those outrages.A.
