SECRET . Copy No    y y___mCP.107(27) . CABINET.COST OF PROVISION OF MEDICAL TREATMENT FOR   UNINSURED WAR PENSIONERS.Memorandum by trio Minister of HealthsI think It necessary to bring to the notice of the Cabinet a matter -which has been under discussion between the Minister of Pensions and myself, and on which we have been unable to arrive at an agreement.     The question is that of the continuance of the proviaion at the cost of the Navy, Army and Air Force Insurance Fund of medical treatment for war pensioners who are not Insured under the scheme of National Health Insurance.The Navy, Army&quot;and Air Force Insurance Fund Is a fund which was set up under the National Insurance Act of 1911 and derives its income from the contributions-paid In respect of men serving In the Forces of the Crown who aro not members of Approved Societies and of such of these men as continue to be insured and members of the Fund after their discharge from the Forces on the ground that they are unable, by reason of Impaired health, to obtain admission to Approved Societies.     The objects of the Fund are to provide maternity -benefit for the wives of the serving members and all the ordinary benefits of National Health Insurance to the men who continue as members after discharge.In 1917 arrangements were come to under which theFand accepted a liability to provide medical benefit for menwho were discharged Invalided from the Forces and were not entitled to that benefit as insured persons * and these arrange-ments have been continued up to the present time by.virtue of1
9 1A/ ^Regulations made under Section 59(3) of the National Health Insurance Act, 1924.      I am satisfied that the arrangement under vsihich Health Insurance funds are used for the benefit of persons outside the general scheme of health Insurance was originally intended to be a purely temporary was measure. It would have been discontinued many years ago but for representations made by the Minister of Pensions that Its abandonment would embarrass him in the discharge of his obligation to provide treatment to pensioners In respect of disabilities attributable to their war service.     For this reason the continuance of the arrangements has been accepted by myself and previous Ministers of Health^ and this acceptance was no doubt largely influenced by the fact that there was in the Navy, Army and Air Force Irisiihance Fund a large surplus not required to meet its liabilities towards its own members.The position in this respect has, however,--been completely altered by the Economy Act of last year.     Under Section 5 of the Act, out of the surplus of  1,500,000 in the Fund a sum of  1,100,000 was surrendered to the Exchequer. This provision met with strenuous opposition In Parliament but? was justified by the Government on the ground that the balance of  400,000 left In the Fund was ample for all its requirements, and In accordance with a proposal put forward by the Secretary of State for War, a provision was made in the Bill that this   -r balance should be used to provide the members of the Fund who have been discharged from the Forces in impaired health with additional benefits over and above the ordinary benefits of National Health Insurance to which they had previously been entitled.     A oromise was given that these additional benefits should be equivalent to the -average of additional benefits granted by Approved Societies to their members and accordingly, since July 1926, the members have become- entitled to increased
6 drates of sickness, disablement and maternity benefits, and also to the provision of dental and ophthalmic treatment. It was believed that the balance    of surplus left in the Fund would be Sufficient to enable these additional benefits to be maintained but experience has shown that the demand for the treatment benefits is considerably greater than had bedh expected.     The Fund is only allowed to expend in any year on these treatment benefits such sum as the Government Actuary may certify to be available for the purpose (with a margin of 10 per cent, to be recovered by reduction of the amount available for the next succeeding year).     The amount certified by the Government Actuary as available for the first year, ending 4th July, 1927, is  5,000, but already, up to the 17th March, 1927, liabilities have been incurred to the amount of  6,000 and aetual payments to the amount of  3,300 have been made.     There Is no sign of any abate-ment in the claims for treatment benefits and it seems clear that before long the whole amount of money available for the purpose will have been exhausted.I am therefore faced with the position that I must either withdraw or curtail the treatment benefits which have been promised to these men, or that more money be   made available to the Fund to enable the benefits to be continued. The withdrawal or curtailment of the benefits would provoke a great outcry and cannot, I think, be contemplated.     It would be said, and I think Justly, that under the Economy Act the Exchequer had appropriated so much of the surplus in the Fund that it has been found to be impossible to continue to provide for its members the benefits promised to them.It therefore becomes essential that the Fund should be enabled to set free more money in order to enable these
treatment benefits to be continued.      The only way In which I can see a possibility of this being done Is by the Fund being relieved of its liability for the cost of providing medical treatment for uninsured war pensioners.     It would be possible for me   to do thi3 at any time simply by wlth-drawing the Regulations by virtue of which the arrangement Is made.     I feel reluctant, however, to take this course, as any withdrawal from ex-Service men of benefits to which they have been entitled would be sure to arouse criticism in Parliament and elsewhere.     I recognise too the convenience to the Minister of Pensions of the use of the general practitioner service provided under National Health Insurance for the purpose cf discharging his obligation to provide pensioners with medical treatment In respect of disabilities attributable to war service.     I have therefore Informed him that I am willing, if he so desires, that such treatment should continue to be provided through the Health Insurance machinery, provided that the cost Is borne In future not by the Navy, Army and Air Force Insurance Fund., but out of his Vote.     This proposal, however, the Minister, of Pensions does not see his way to accept and I therefore seek the decision of the Cabinet on the point.The number of uninsured pensioners at present entitled to medical benefit at the cost of the Fund is about 10,000 and the cost Is about  7,000 a year.     Though the sum involved la trifling in itself, the removal of the liability from the Fund and the acceptance of this small additional burden by the Minister of Pensions in respect of his own pensioners would set free all the money which I require in order that the members of the Navy, Army and Air Force Insurance Fund should continue to receive the treatment benefits whieh have been promised to them.

The only way in which I can see a possibility of this being done is by the Fund being relieved of its liability for the cost of providing medical treatment for uninsured war pensioners.     It would be possible for me   to do this at any time simply by with-drawing the Regulations by virtue of which the arrangement is made.

The Minister of Pensions has suggested that in order td enable the Fund to continue to meet all its liabilities a call should be made on the Service Departments with whom, under the Act, rests the ultimate responsibility for maintaining the solvency of the Fund.     This is not, however, a feasible solution.     The Fund has no claim on the Service Departments unless and until it has been valued as a whole and found to be actuariable In deficiency, i.e. unable to meet the estimated cost of providing its members with the ordinary benefits only. This is not at present the case and it is, indeed, with a view to avoiding a deficiency that the Fund is only allowed to spend on treatment benefits In any year such sum as the Government Actuary certifies to be available for the purpose. My present problem Is not one of dealing with an actuarial deficiency but an actual shortage of cash immediately required to meet dentists&apos; bills falling due for payment.N.O.50th March, 1927
