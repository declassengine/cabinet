Printed for the Cabinet.   April 1927.CONFIDENTIAL.CP. 121 (27).THE EGYPTIAN ARMY.I CIRCULATE to the Cabinet a very able despatch (Enclosure (A)) from Lord Lloyd, resuming and confirming the views which he has already expressed by telegram on this subject. I also circulate a telegram (Enclosure (B) ) from Sir W. Tyrrell, who was instructed to discuss these proposals and the alternative suggested by the Foreign Office with Lord Lloyd. When in London I believe that Sir William preferred the Foreign Office plan.   It will be seen that he now supports Lord Lkwd.I myself leant to the Foreign Office alternative, and I think it right to lay my reasons before the Cabinet.   They will be found in Enclosure (C).It will be seen from these papers that Lord Lloyd himself at one time adduced strong arguments against the course which he now recommends, and that it reverses in some respects the policy of Lord Allenby and the late Sirdar, but Lord Lloyd and Sir William Tyrrell believe it to be the one most likely to be accepted by the Egyptian Government, and they and (as I understand) General Haking concur in recommending it to the Government.My advisers in the Foreign Office still consider that Lord Lloyd is mistaken and that in the long run the Foreign Office proposal would give us a stronger position ; but I cannot take upon myself alone the responsibility of asking the Cabinet to reject the considered opinion of three such men, all of whom are on the spot. If, however, my colleagues share my views, I am prepared to press them again upon Lord Lloyd ; if not, I propose that he be authorised to carry out his own proposals and that he be informed that His Majesty&apos;s Government are prepared to insist, whatever the consequences, on their acceptance by the Egyptian Government.A. C.April 10, 1927.Enclosure (A).Lord Lloyd to Sir Austen Chamberlain. (Received April 6.) (No. 183.) &apos;Sir, The Residency, Cairo, March 28, 1927.I HAVE the honour to submit to you herewith, in accordance with the instructions conveyed to me in your telegram No. 83 of the 25th March, a compre-hensive review of the developments which have taken place in the Egyptian army since the war, with my final recommendations as to the best method of dealing with the problem as it confronts His Majesty&apos;s Government to-day. I have, as you desired, fully consulted Sir W. Tyrrell before composing this despatch.2. It is important that I should at the outset endeavour to describe to you the political atmosphere in which the question must be negotiated.3. It is becoming increasingly clear that, in existing circumstances, no Egyptian Ministry, of whatever political complexion, can for long maintain its position unimpaired4. On the one hand, it has, with the comparatively meagre talents at its disposal, to contend from the outset with long-established foreign rights and interests, many of them exceedingly powerful; and it cannot, it finds, afford to be extremist in its dealings with the accredited representatives of the foreign Powers who support. those rights and interests. As regards Great Britain, the charter of whose special position is His Majesty&apos;s Governments unilateral Declaration of the 28th February, 1922, with its four reserved points, no Egyptian Ministry, except that of Yehya Pasha Ibrahim in 1923 a Palace Cabinet which promulgated the Constitution, and was itself in consequence unfettered by Parliament has ever overtly recognised the3933 [16011] B
validity of that special position; yet successive Governments have learned that any violation of the reserved points to which we take exception spells disaster for them.5. On the other side stands Parliament, at present under the effective influence of Zaghlul, who has in the past repeatedly stated in public that he does not acknowledge the existence of the 1922 declaration. He has consistently adopted the unreal attitude that Egypt wrested her independence from Great Britain by unaided efforts, her achievements finding their natural consummation in King Fuad&apos;s proclamation of himself as an independent sovereign on the 15th March, 1922.6. Any Egyptian Cabinet, therefore, which takes office with Parliament in existence inevitably finds itself between the devil and the deep sea; and the present Ministers fear above all things the parliamentary question, liable as it is to expose the fact that, in spite of their intransigence in the past they are unable to-day to make any more headway against us than their predecessors.7. As a natural result, the Government, in order to satisfy Parliament without coming into open conflict with us, is driven to methods of erosion, at first insidious, but later, if we give no sign, bolder and more serious.8. The outburst of friendly sentiment, with which I was greeted here on my return in November last, was almost entirely fictitious. The Wafd undoubtedly feared that I had come from the Imperial Conference with pleins pouvoirs to settle the Egyptian question. They were in the throes of what they regarded as a grave economic crisis. They had incurred the unpopularity of sections of the permanent officials and temporarily of the fellaheen. They were the subject of virulent attacks from the palace press. They were on bad terms with Italy, and read sinister meanings into my visits to Paris and Rome. Finally, they probably thought that the election of Maher and Nekrashi to Parliament during my absence had shaken my faith in the Constitution, the restoration of which I had worked to secure in the previous spring.9. Faced with these difficulties, they decided that they were too weak to risk a conflict with His Majesty&apos;s Government, and must have time to consolidate their position, keeping me immobile as far as they possibly could in the interval. Finding that I was armed with no form of ultimatum, they soon renewed and intensified their various intrigues. Meanwhile, faced with the impending liquidation of Law 28, I for my part was tied by the necessity of securing the retention of British officials in the departments covered by the reserved points in the 1922 declaration, and of obtaining fair terms of service for those retained proprio motu by the Egyptian Government elsewhere in the Administration.10. In the Egyptian army the erosion indicated above has now reached a point where we are, I submit, left with no possible alternative but vigorous intervention; and if we are to act we should do so at once, there being several factors which, as shown below, make the question one of urgency.11. It is, however, evident from what I have said above that if His Majesty&apos;s Government insist on the Egyptian Government taking any drastic or spectacular action, which is at once against the wishes of the Chamber and in accordance with our 1922 declaration, the Cabinet is not unlikely to resign. The Prime Minister is finding the methods of his Wafdist colleagues harder and harder to bear; and if the breach between him and them widens, and simultaneously we present the Government with any strong demands, the Cabinet may use those demands as a pretext for leaving office. To go out on an issue with His Majesty&apos;s Government is always the most respectable form of demise open to an Egyptian Ministry.12. If, on the other hand, we can make the present Cabinet amenable to our wishes, there is clearly every advantage in our keeping it in office, representing as it does, in theory at any rate, the mass of the country; the existing Ministers are without any doubt strongly addicted to office; and in the last resort they would very probably accept demands on our part in respect of the army provided that they were legitimate, moderate and presented in a palateable form. In any case delay, as shown below, will inevitably increase our difficulties; and we are unlikely to get a better opportunity than we have now, as far as I can see.13. Stated briefly, the position in the Egyptian army is that the erosion of -our influence, which has been going on steadily since 1922, has recently become far more rapid and has been accompanied by proposals for substantial increases in both numbers and armaments. I have, with your authority, spoken plainly on the subject to King Fuad, the Prime Minister and Zaghlul on different occasions, pointing out that such increases are unfavourably viewed by His Majesty&apos;s Government.   But
the proposals are none the less being proceeded with, and, as I explain later, we are in danger of being presented at an early date with faits accomplis.14. The principal stages in the decline of our control over the Egyptian army were mostly set out in my telegram No. 61 of the 3rd March. They were as follows : (a.) Azmi Pasha, on appointment as Minister in November 1922, created a special section in his Ministry for settling under his personal direction a number of minor matters hitherto dealt with by the Sirdar. This encroachment grew until in September 1923 he went so far as to dismiss for inefficiency on his own responsibility a number of students from the military school. The Sirdar raised no effective objection; and, in pursuance of his policy of effecting the gradual, Egyptianisation of the army, began to use the Minister as a channel for his communications with the King.(b.) In January 1924, in accordance with this policy, the command of the Cairo district was ceded to an Egyptian, the post of Inspector-General being created and filled by a British officer.    Simultaneously, the last two&apos; Egyptian battalions in Egypt under British command were taken over by natives.(c.) In March 1924 Shahin Bey, who had been attacked by the Wafd for alleged brutality in pacifying the provinces in 1919, was placed on pension by the Sirdar in view of the intransigent attitude of Zaghlul Pasha, with whom it was desired not to risk a crisis in view of impending negotiations (see Lord Allenby&apos;s despatch No. 257). The effect of this decision on the army was profound, as Lord Allenby himself recognised.(d.) In May 1924 Zaghlul&apos; stated publicly : &quot; It is not compatible with the self-respect of the Egyptian Government to have a foreigner as its Commander-in-chief nor foreigners as subordinate officers. This we ought to blot out.&quot;(e.) Hassib Pasha, ZaghluTs Minister for War, worked hard to make the army a political machine, and offered determined opposition to proposals on the part of the Sirdar to recruit new British officers for service in the Egyptian units in the Sudan.(/.) On the murder of the Sirdar in November 1924, Lord Allenby recommended His Majesty&apos;s Government to maintain, but postpone, their previous intention of appointing an Egyptian Sirdar. His Majesty&apos;s Government agreed, and King Fuad was informed of this intention in the following May. Further, shortly after the murder, Lord Allenby so far from discouraging the growing powers of the Minister, proposed to force responsibility upon him in respect of the disposal of the Egyptian officers expelled from the Sudan (his telegram No. 439).(g.) In January 1925 the Army Council was formed at the instance of King Fuad (Lord Allenby&apos;s despatch No. 92). Its creation radically affected the powers inherent in the Sirdarship by making appointments, promotions and decorations dependent on an Officers&apos; Committee, and submissible to the King through the Minister.(h.) In April 1925 the Frontiers Administration and the Departments of Supplies and Recruiting, and in June 1925 the Finance Department passed under Egyptian control.(i.) Musa Pasha Fuad, on appointment as Minister in March 1925, made every . effort to suborn the army from its allegiance to its British chiefs, constantly holding meetings of officers in his house for the purpose.15. Since the restoration of a constitutional regime a year ago the situation has become rapidly worse. The present Minister of War has had to face more than one acrimonious discussion in the Chamber, for example, the debate in September last reported by Mr. Henderson in his despatch No. 606. He has in consequence been driven to embark on the various proposals set out in my telegram No. 469 and my despatch No. 780, namely, to reduce military service from five to three years with the openly-declared object of increasing the country&apos;s trained reserve; to bring nine battalions up to higher establishment; to build new barracks in various places; to abolish many of the restrictions on the carriage of arms; and to create a military air force. In spite ,of my representations, those of the above proposals requiring [16011] &apos; b2
financial approval are included in the draft budget shortly to be submitted to Parliament.16. More serious still, determined attempts are being made by Khashaba Bey to deprive the Inspector-General of all effective authority and prestige. His first interference with General Spinks took the form of an attempt last spring to reinstate a number of the Sudanese officers who had been placed en disponibilite in connection with the political troubles in the Sudan at the end of 1924. Next, in General Spinks&apos;s absence on leave in the summer, he endeavoured to upset the existing regime at the Cairo Military School; the Army Council, under his instructions, actually drafted a law to remove the school from the control of the Sirdar; and had not General Spinks returned earlier than had been expected, the proposal would undoubtedly have gone to Parliament (my despatch No. 780). Khashaba Bey spent the summer getting into personal touch with officers of all ranks, hearing their complaints and promising them redress for their grievances. Finally, he began to inspect military units in company with two members of the Parliamentary Committee for War, viz., Saleh Bey Harb and Abdul Rahman Bey Azzam; the former of these two deserted to the Senussi with his command (about sixty coastguardsmen) during the war; both fought with the Senussi against us. Shortly after my return Khashaba Bey endeavoured unsuccessfully to have the War Office &quot; Gazettes &quot; governing officers&apos; promotions and appointments issued in his own name. Since then the Officers&apos; Committee of the Army Council (Lord Allenby&apos;s despatch No. 92 of 1925) has had to modify its recommendations regarding promotions and appointments in deference to his wishes. Further, he has refused the Inspector-GeneraFs recommendations in certain instances where disciplinary action was necessary, has repeatedly corresponded direct with the latter&apos;s staff officers, and has, on his own responsibility, detailed officers of the headquarters staff for duties on boards and committees. Finally, when replying to a question in the Chamber recently he deliberately mis-stated the position as to the devolution of the late Sirdar&apos;s powers, in the face of a clear warning from me; and in pursuance of his answer, the Parliamentary Committee are at present engaged in redefining the functions of the Army Council and Officers&apos; Committee at the expense of the Sirdarship and Inspectorship-General. If these attempts succeed the position of the Inspector-General, who, as you are aware, has for two years been endeavouring to perform duties of Acting Sirdar without the rank or pay, in circumstances of increasing difficulty, will become definitely impossible.17. As regards the Frontiers Administration (which, in accordance with the decision reported in Mr. Henderson&apos;s despatch No. 606, is shown in the new budget as amalgamated with the coastguards service) the Minister of War was intending to dispense with five of its seven British officers, and pari passu to replace seconded Egyptian personnel as soon as possible by officers who had either fought for the Senussi or had been expelled from the Sudan after the SirdaPs death; he actually gave written orders to the latter effect. I have been able to secure the retention of all the British officers in this Administration; but the Minister, presumably in the intention of side-tracking them, has, in budgeting for them, described the posts to be given to most of them in new terms. Further, he proposes to convert the Camel Corps and Car Patrols into a police force without central authority. Simultaneously, the Government are studying a project for the application of the legal code in the ordinary, as opposed to the existing tribal, way, in the areas under the jurisdiction of the Administration, a change which would greatly weaken the position and authority of the Governors. The re-establishment of a native summary court at El Arish has already been approved. All these steps are being taken beyond doubt with a view to rendering the nomad tribes amenable to political influence and pro tanto diminishing our influence over them. The Acting Director-General of the Administration, who is now the driving force at headquarters, is a notorious Anglophobe, and works in close touch with the Minister. I can supply you, if you wish, with numerous instances of his attempts to undermine the prestige of the British officers in the Administration. The Governor of Sinai in particular finds his position increasingly difficult, as I reported in my telegram No. 96 of the 24th March. The Frontiers Administration is in essence a large intelligence department, and, as such, plays an important part in the defence scheme of Egypt. Its present successful relations with the lawless Beduin tribesmen are based on summary justice, military discipline and undivided control. It is the clear intention of the Egyptian Government deliberately to destroy this state of affairs.18. The following table and explanations, already communicated to you in my telegram No. 62 of the 3rd.March, may be convenient for reference, showing, as they
do, the comparative strengths of the Egyptian army in Egypt in the years 1914, 1922 and 1926, respectively : (a.) Table-1914. 1922. 1926.Infantry. battalions        ...          ... 3 7 11Artillery batteries         ...          ... 1 1 4Garrison artillery companies        ... 1 1 2Cavalry squadrons         ...          ... 1 1 totals    (with   headquarter    staff, . A.S.C., &amp;c.)2,500    4,800    10,581(b.) The increases recorded in the above table are explained as follows :  (i.) Infantry. In 1914 there were six Egyptian battalions in the Sudan. Of these, four battalions were brought down to Egypt during the Avar; two returned and two remained. Two battalions were finally retransferrecT from .the Sudan between 1922 and 1924. The last two were ejected from the Sudan in 1924, i.e., after the Sirdar&apos;s murder. Two new battalions were raised in 1925 (both on the higher establishment, i.e., 800 as opposed to 600 strong), mainly to absorb Egyptian officers turned out of Sudanese battalions and civilian employment in the Sudan in November 1924.(ii.) Artillery. Three batteries and one garrison company were ejected fromthe Sudan after the Sirdar&apos;s murder, (iii.) Cavalry. One new squadron was raised in 1925 to absorb personnelejected from the Sudan.(c.) Bodyguard. In addition to the above the bodyguard, created since 1922, now comprises one squadron of cavalry and one battalion of infantry, i.e., thirty-nine officers and 976 other ranks.(d.) Staff. The Egyptian army was in 1914 under British control, the Sirdar being resident in the Sudan. All headquarter and departmental staffs were then British. To-day there are only nine British officers serving with the Egyptian army; and only.one of them, the Inspector-General (who is acting as Sirdar, though the Egyptian Government refuse to call him more than Inspector-General) has executive command.(e.) Armament-1914.6-2-95 guns.4 -450 Maxims.-303 old pattern M.N. rifles.1922. 4 2-95 guns.-303 new pattern S.M.L.E. rifles.1926.Artillery 2 3-75 howitzers pack. 12-2-95 guns. 6 10-pounder guns. 4 Vickers machine guns. -303 S.M.L.E. rifles.Frontiers Administration  3 Lewis guns.Bodyguard 6 Vickers machine guns. 2 Hotchkiss machine guns. 6 Lewis guns.19. An analysis of the history of the Egyptian army as summarised in para-graph 14 above brings out, as I explained in my telegram No. 74 of the 9th March, the striking fact that each Minister of War in turn of whatever political complexion has pursued from the start a policy of active hostility to our rights and interests. Of no other Ministry can this be said in anything approaching the same degree.20. There can be little doubt that one reason for this fact is that no Egyptian Government has yet clearly apprehended His Majesty&apos;s Governments application of
the 1922 declaration to the Egyptian army. Not only have no limitations been imposed upon the strength of its units in Egypt in virtue of the declaration, but the surrender of those units to native control was to all intents and purposes encouraged; and subsequent developments were acquiesced in without protest. This was apparently due to the fact that it was thought that lack of money and the unsoldierly qualities of the Egyptians made their army a negligible quantity (Secretary of State for War&apos;s memorandum enclosed in your despatch No. 1261 of 1924). Successive Egyptian Ministers must have realised none the less that their programmes directly affected one, and indirectly but hardly less definitely, two more of the four reserved points; increase in the military strength of Egypt, that is to say, cannot but menace the security of our imperial communications (notably the Suez Canal), complicate our defence of the country against foreign aggression and render our protection of foreign interests more difficult. Uncertain, on the other hand, how far we should in the last resort allow them to go, they have felt, as Orientals are apt to do, that they must leave no stone unturned to gain the maximum; and when Parliament has been in existence the stimulus has invariably been much greater.21. To Egyptians generally military display has a strong appeal; and the politicians have turned this sentiment to account by affecting to be ashamed of the present army, representing its methods and equipment as antiquated and decrying its value as a fighting force. They argue that this state of affairs is the outcome of a deliberate policy of obstruction on the part of His Majesty&apos;s Government. The General Officer Commanding, so far from confirming these allegations, considers that the Egyptian army compares not very unfavourably in turn-out and drill with British troops. This, which confirms my own impressions, is undoubtedly clue primarily to the personality of the present Inspector-General. The main point of distinction between the two armies here, apart from the fact that Egypt does not possess the deadlier kinds of modern lethal weapons, is, in General Haking&apos;s view, the indifference and incapacity of the Egyptian officer class. It is, however, certain that Eg)m.t&apos;s lack of machine guns and other modern instruments of warfare is a subject regarding which public opinion here is, rightly or wrongly, exceedingly sensitive; and this feeling is a factor which in framing our solution it would be most unwise to overlook.22. In my telegram No. 74 of the 9th March I analysed the concrete proposals with which we are confronted. The following is a slight amplification of that analysis :  (a.) Raising of nine battalions from lower to higher establishment.This proposal is intended primarily to bring these battalions up to the numbers customary elsewhere; and simultaneously to secure uniformity with the other two battalions. It will involve an addition of 36 officers and 1,620 other ranks. Of itself such an increase would not seriously affect the military situation, and it has the advantage that it would absorb some more of the discontented officers, who have been unemployment^ed since their ejection from the Sudan after the Sirdar&apos;s murder.(b.) Reduction of period of colour service from five to three years.This is advertised to increase the trained reserve; but it is primarily a bid for popularity with the fellaheen. It has ample sanction in the practice of other countries. Given the limitation of the actual rifle reserve to its present figure, the danger in this proposal should not be great. The calling up of reservists in a time of emergency would in any case be a matter of great difficulty in this country.(c.) Purchase of twenty-two machine guns for the eleven infantry battalions.The mules and harness have been here since July 1925, Lord Allenby having as you are aware waived any objection to Egypfs acquisition of these guns. The Frontier Administration and the bodyguard possess machine-guns; and His Majesty&apos;s Governments failure to confirm Lord Allenby&apos;s permission is a subject to wliich the present Minister constantly reverts. On the other hand, so large a number of machine-guns is, General Haking points out, a very serious-addition to the strength of the Egyptian army.(d.) Frontiers Administration and Coastguards Service.The proposed amalgamation of these two departments was certainly designed to undermine our influence over them.   For some time the practicability of this.
amalgamation1 administratively a most unsound measure was in doubt. It is, however, now being proceeded with. It has been accompanied by a recrudescence of intrigue among the nomad tribes.(e.) Military Air Force.The Egyptian Government are proposing to initiate a military air service. As a start it has been suggested to them by the Inspector-General, whom the Minister for War consulted, that they should begin on a modest scale with eight machines (my despatch No. 70).23. We are then faced with (a) certain concrete proposals,&apos; (b) insidious attempts to undermine the powers and the prestige of the Inspector-General and of the British officers under him and in the Frontiers Administration and Coastguard Service, (c) the gradual saturation of the army with politics.24. One of three courses is open to us : (a) To let matters take their course, in the hope that consideration, e.g., of expense, will deter the Egyptian Government from proceeding very far; (b) to endeavour to check these tendencies by personal persuasion and unofficial pressure; (c) to make definite demands.25. I submit that (a) is self-evidently inadmissible, after all that I have already said on your instructions. I have already put (b) to the test and cannot guarantee its success.   I am therefore driven back to (c).26. We have, I submit, no choice but to communicate our requirements to the Egyptian Government without delay in friendly but plain terms and adhere to what we say at all costs. If we do so, those costs, given all the circumstances, are as I stated in my telegram No. 74 of the 9th March, likely, in my opinion, to be small in comparison with what we should otherwise be forced to pay later. I agree in principle with the Secretary of State for War&apos;s opinion as expressed in the last paragraph of the enclosure in his letter to you of the 21st May, 1925 (your despatch No. 560). Inaction, after my repeated representations, could only be construed as weakness. It would indeed almost certainly be attributed to your preoccupations with China.27. I concur with the view expressed in your telegram No. 67 of the 11th March, that whatever policy we now adopt must be as reasonable, broad and construc-tive as circumstances permit and the following proposals, already communicated to you in my telegrams No. 75 of the 9th March and No. 89 of the 22nd March, are designed not only to prevent the erosion at present proceeding, but to afford the basis for a more final settlement if and when such a settlement proves possible.28. Our first step must, I submit, be to restore the authority and prestige of the present Inspector-General. On the creation of the Sudan Defence Force in January 1925, Huddleston Pasha on Lord Allenby&apos;s instructions delegated his powers in Egypt to the Inspector-General (Lord Allenby&apos;s telegram No. 31). The Egyptian Government were so informed, but thev have never called the Inspector-General Acting Sirdar, though he has carried out the duties of the latter post ever since. I propose that we should demand that his right to these powers should be acknowledged; also that he should as is normal be given the acting rank of Ferik (corresponding to that of a Divisional Commander) with a suitable increase in salary. This will involve a recognition on the part of the Egyptian Government that the Minister is only a formal channel for the passing of the recommendations of the Officers&apos; Committee to the King (Lord Allenby&apos;s despatch No. 92 of 1925). I consider that we may properly ask for an assurance in this sense.29. I should propose to insist further on the appointment of a senior British officer at headquarters to act for the Sirdar in his absence. He might be called Assistant Inspector-General. We manifestly cannot continue to depend entirely on one executive officer, without provision for his absences on leave or through sickness. Indeed, were General Spinks forced to vacate the Inspectorship-General to-day owing, for example, to ill-health, no one could possibly succeed to the highly anomalous position which he occupies. The Inspector-General is satisfied that if the powers delegated to him by Huddleston Pasha were formally recognised, and he were given a deputy, he could maintain our desiderata in the Egyptian army for an indefinite period. I see no reason to dissent from this opinion, and in consequence I regard General Spinks&apos;s position as. the vital point in the whole problem.30. As regards the Frontiers Administration, it being axiomatic, I agree, that British officers holding His Majesty&apos;s commission should not serve under an Egyptian officer except in advisory cajDacities (Secretary of State for War&apos;s. memo-randum enclosed in your despatch No. 1261 of 1924), we must, I think, insist on the
Frontiers Administration (which will involve the Coastguards also, as soon as effect is given to the proposed amalgamation) coming under the direct authority of the Inspector-General. We cannot countenance a continuance of the conditions described in paragraph 17 above. The least, in my view, that we can do with safety in this Administration is to restore in effect the status quo ante 1925, when, to our cost, we allowed its direction to pass into native hands. My present proposal avoids the necessity of our demanding the reinstitution of a British Director-General. The alternative possibility suggested by you, i.e., the separation of the Administration from the Ministry of War, is, as I pointed out in my telegram No. 89 of the 22nd March, open to the objections (a) that we should be left with the necessity of elaborating safeguards in an entirely new situation; (b) that the Arab tribes can be handled better by a military than by a civil regime; (c) that so radical and con-spicuous a change would be much more difficult for Egypt to accept than the alternative that I have proposed. Finally, it would, in my opinion, be a serious error, in view of the Minister of War&apos;s recent intrigues, to see the Frontiers Adminis-tration left to be dealt with as a separate issue.31. The concession by the Egyptian Government of the demands suggested in the three preceding paragraphs, combined with our retention of the posts which we at present hold, would, I submit, enable us safely to acquiesce in the raising of the nine infantry battalions from the lower to the higher establishment, in the reduction of military service from five to three years, and in the development of a military air service on the lines proposed.32. We could not, however, I think, in view of recent developments, possibly allow the Egyptian Government at this stage, except in return for assurances and safeguards to which they could never agree, the twenty-two machine guns promised them by my predecessor. As I explained in my telegram No. 75 of the 9th March, my interpretation of the views of the Secretary of State for War (Lord Allenby&apos;s despatch No. 560) is that such an augmentation of strength combined with the other proposals described above might involve His Majesty&apos;s Government in an increase of the garrison here and make it necessary to insist that no Egyptian troops should be stationed on the Suez Canal or along the Cairo-Ismailia communications. Further, the General Ofneer Commanding points out, first, that in the preservation of internal security every humane Government avoids the use of automatic weapons; secondly, that, in the event of our being involved in, for example, anti-dynastic disturbances (which certain sections of the Wafd undoubtedly desire), the native soldiery would probably join the mob, and, if armed with machine guns, would render it very hard for our troops to restore, order without extensive bloodshed.33. As reported in my telegram No. 89 of the 22nd March, I have, after further consideration induced by your telegram No. 67 of the 11th March, discussed with General Haking the possibility of throwing these machine guns into the scale against four senior British instructional officers (one for each brigade) and such technical personnel as the Egyptian Government might themselves find necessary, pointing-out that, from a purely political point of view, such a concession would offer definite advantage, depriving the Egyptians as it would, do of such sense of grievance as the politicians had inculcated into them on this score, and liquidating simultaneously an awkward promise. Moreover, the Inspector-General feels confident that, given full powers, he could control the disposal of these guns sufficiently to minimise their danger. I cannot, however, but defer to the objections which the General Officer Commanding sees even to this compromise from the standpoint of his military responsibilities here.34. I have accordingly suggested to General Haking that His Majesty&apos;s Government should make the acquisition of these machine guns (always against the minimum of British personnel necessary effectively to train and supervise the Egyptian army in their use) conditional on the Egyptian Government carrying out faithfully for a reasonable period their side of the arrangements suggested above. He concurs in this proposal, which I recommend therefore for your favourable consideration. I should, however, treat this question as a separate issue, and it might conceivably prove unnecessary to raise it at all. As I informed you in my telegram No. 89, I have learned that the Minister for War, in anticipation of the possibility of a refusal on the part of His Majesty&apos;s Government to allow him any machine guns, recently altered the form of his budgetary provision for them in order to give himself a loophole for escape from parliamentary criticism in that contingency; and I shall, I need hardly say, leave well alone if I possibly can.35. &quot; The above, as explained in my telegram No. 75 of the 9th March, represents
1 &apos;  economy considered opinion as to the way in which the problem should be handled. To consider a second course open to us : if Egypt preferred an Egyptian Sirdar, we should, I submit, revert to the terms offered to Ziwar Pasha (my telegram No. 149 of 1926), agreeing in this event also to acquiesce in the three proposals mentioned in paragraph 31. But the present Government have already intimated that they would never agree to the terms set out in that telegram; and their present policy is clearly to render the Sirdarship unnecessary. Moreover, we should, for the reasons already explained, now have to add further conditions on the same lines in respect of the Frontiers Administration and Coastguards Service.36. A third possibility, namely, that of insisting on a gradual reduction of the Egyptian army, has been rejected by you (your despatch No. 1410). We might perhaps offer in negotiation, as a possible solution pending a general settlement, to equip an effective modern force of, say, 5,000 men under the old-time complement of British officers; but it is an offer which the Egyptian Government would almost certainly refuse.37. Any of the three courses suggested above would probably suffice to arrest the present process of erosion of our rights and also to a large extent to prevent the contamination of the army with political influence.38. I am persuaded, as are the General Officer Commanding and the Inspector-General, that the only sure way of excluding politics from the Egyptian army in its present stage of development is to control promotions, appointments and decorations on honest lines.39. The withdrawal of all British personnel, on the other hand, which Sir Lee Stack had originally in mind, would be exposed to the objections (a) that the fulfil -ment by Egypt of the guarantees which we should have to demand would be impossible to enforce; (b) that the army would very rapidly become a political machine; (c) that as regards the Frontiers Administration we should lose our present influence over the Arab tribes without any compensating advantage.40. As to tactics, I have the honour to revert to the suggestions embodied in my telegram No. 89 of the 22nd March. I submit that I should be authorised to approach the Egyptian Government on the following lines : &quot; We are looking forward to a friendly settlement with Egypt. In any such settlement it is clear that the latter must assist us in the safeguarding of our vital interests. Among these are the protection of our imperial communica-tions and the preservation of the country from foreign aggression. We should like to have the Egyptian army as an efficient modern force forming an integral part of our scheme of defence; and we are prepared to give Egypt every assistance in the creation of such a force, subject to the condition that, as it will be called upon to co-operate with us, it must be trained on British lines, i.e., by the minimum number of British officers necessary.&quot; We have lately had to call attention more than once to a definite and disquieting tendency on the part of the Egyptian Government to turn their army into a political machine. This, which has been the ruin of many armies else-where, has been accompanied by determined efforts to diminish the authority of the Inspector-General and the few other British officers still serving under the Ministry of War.&quot; These tendencies cannot but be fatal to the chances of a friendly settlement of the question; and, sincerely anxious to lay the foundations of a solution satisfactory to both countries, we invite Egypt forthwith to reconsider her position. For the sake of reaching a modus Vivendi, we, for our part, are ready to agree to certain proposals to which we have hitherto taken exception provided that Egypt, in her turn, will meet our legitimate requirements.&quot; If the Egyptian Government refuse to accept these proposals, they must realise that we are left with no alternative but to regard the Egyptian army as potentially hostile to us. In this event we shall be forced to take without delay such measures as we consider necessary to safeguard our rights and interests.&quot;41. In your telegram No. 67 you discussed the possibility of the Cabinet resigning on the issue. I find it hard to believe that in the last resort they would leave office rather than accept the particular proposals which I have put forward, unless, as I explained earlier in this despatch, our demands came at a time when they were disintegrating for other reasons. More than one of my competent advisers believe that they would at once accept the above proposals when they[16011] c
trealised that His Majesty&apos;s Government meant business. It is in the oriental nature to cede readily to absolute necessity. It is, however, very possible that the Ministry might resign. We are largely at the mercy of the uncertain moods of both the Prime Minister and Zaghlul, whose relations have undoubtedly been much more strained recently, and were, a few days ago, at breaking point over a Wafd proposal to revive the draft law for the election of omdahs (Mr. Henderson&apos;s telegram No. 391 of the 4th September last).42. Whether, in that event, another Ministry would take office with Zaghlul as President of the Chamber, I cannot foretell with any certainty. A considerable section of the Wafd would undoubtedly urge acquiescence in our demands, and they would not improbably carry their point against the extreme elements, the necessity of preserving the Constitution being a point on which all parties are in solid agreement.43. My general view is that, in a matter in which our rights are so clear as this, we have, regret it as we may, no alternative but to go straight ahead, dealing ad hoc with the situation which results. Zaghlul probably still considers that Egypt stands to lose more than we do by a crisis with us at this juncture. We have, in any case, reached a stage when we can, in my view, contemplate with comparative equanimity the prospect that Egypt may find herself on some such issue as the present left for a time without a Ministry. In such an event dissolution and, finally, a reversion to palace rule might prove inevitable; but even so, it should be possible for us to do a great deal towards preventing a return to the state of affairs which existed in Nashat Pasha&quot;s day.44. The present solution cannot but be temporary, as you yourself have stated; and the proposals embodied in this despatch seem to me as broad, reasonable and constructive as anything that can be hoped for in the circumstances which I have described. I conceive that you could defend them without difficulty in the House of Commons.45. As I stated in my telegram No. 75 of the 9th March, the question before His Majesty&apos;s Government is in essence simple. Are we going to stand by the 1922 declaration or are we not? We are dealing with a Government which, like all its predecessors but one, has refused to admit the validity of the four reserved points. We could work with it, as with any other Government, which tacitly refrained from violating those points; but, as I have explained above, no Egyptian Ministry with Parliament behind it is ever likely to adopt a negative policy with regard to us on any subject of dispute in which we have not made our position perfectly plain. If we do not make a firm stand in the present case, I cannot see where we ever shall.46. I am satisfied that the moment has not come for us to undertake any settle-ment of the Egyptian army question on more final lines that those which I have suggested. The present atmosphere of calm is, as I have shown, largely unreal. The Wafd&apos;s attitude is determined mainly by fear and uncertainty of my intentions; and they are becoming steadily more aggressive, as they think that I am incapable of resisting the various forms of erosion with which they are experimenting. The ostentatious friendliness of the press on my arrival was inspired and almost wholly insincere. It is now rapidly wearing off, and in regard to the Capitulations in particular (with reference to which I have shown the friendliest disposition), even the Liberal newspapers have, doubtless under the influence of the events in China, lately been almost menacing in tone. I must, indeed, reluctantly admit that, while my relations with the Prime Minister and his colleagues remain friendly, the situation during the winter has deteriorated appreciably as a result of my incapacity, fettered as I was by the necessity of resolving the officials question, to defend British and foreign rights and interests effectively in other matters. The Egyptian army is the most serious instance of this.47. The extremists, led by the notorious Maher and ISJokrashi (who, I learn from trustworthy sources, have in the last two or three weeks been actively reorganising the student bodies for political action) are telling Zaghlul, in effect, that he can safely revert to a less supine policy; and there is little doubt that he has lately moved some way in their direction. The Prime Minister, on the other hand, is warning Zaghlul that his earlier view (i.e., that a conflict with us would be disastrous and that the only sound policy for Egypt is to pursue our friendship) is still correct to-day. What is needed at such a moment is, it seems to me, a corrective which, while not inconsonant with our general policy of construction here within the limits imposed by the 1922 declaration, is sharp enough to convince Zaghlul and the more moderate elements in his entourage both that Adly Pasha&apos;s
estimate of the situation is the right one and that when I give the Egyptian government a friendly warning in the name of His Majesty&apos;s Government on a matter like this, I mean what I say.48. I have the honour to request that I may be informed as soon as possible of His Majesty&apos;s Governments decision in this matter.I have, &amp;c.LLOYDj High Commissioner.Enclosure (B).Lord Lloyd to Sir Austen Chamberlain. (Received April 6.)(No. 109.)(Telegraphic.) Cairo, April 6, 1927.FOLLOWING for Mr. Murray from Sir W. Tyrrell :-&quot; I propose to answer your letter of 26th March at length by next bag. &quot;2. Immediate point at issue, however, is that of proposed Egyptian army reform.&quot; 3. Chamber of Deputies may at any moment approve drastic curtailment of powers of the Sirdarship and Inspectorship-General, and so present us with a provocative fait accompli.&quot;4. Basis of Secretary of State&apos;s proposal is that we should secure a written declaration of general co-operative intent from Egyptian Government. The High Commissioner on his side, while fully appreciating advantage that this proposal would give us vis-a-vis, for example, The Hague Tribunal, doubts both its practicability and its efficiency, and considers that we must rather insist on Egyptian Government recognising our existing rights of control and inspection.&quot;5.There seems to me agreement on policy, viz., maintenance of a non-political&apos;army, but-, cjiyergence of views as to method.&quot;6. On the balance it appears to me that High Commissioner^ view is more likely to achieve object we seek, and also affords an opportunity for testing sincerity of Egyptian professions.&quot;Enclosure (C). Foreign Office Minute.THE body of this despatch, as Lord Lloyd warned us would be the case, does not add materially to the considerations already adduced in his telegrams* in favour of the course recommended by him and against what he believes to be that favoured by us. The opening and closing portions of the despatch, however, provide a lucid and well-balanced review of the political setting of the present problem.2. As Sir William Tyrrell points out in his telegram to me (Cairo telegram No. 109) there is agreement between the Foreign Office and the Residency as to the immediate object of our policy but divergence as to the methods to be adopted. That immediate object is to put an end to the&quot;process by which the Wafd are seeking to uproot any vestige of British influence in the Egyptian army and to make it a political weapon. There&apos; is also agreement that there is nothing to be gained by putting off intervention and that once we do intervene we must see things through to a successful conclusion.3. The essential feature of the course advocated by Lord Lloyd is to insist on General Spinks (and a suitable deputy to replace him when he is away) being-recognised as Acting Sirdar with executive functions and given appropriate rank and pay as such. Lord Lloyd has tried to discover, and regards this as a solution which the present Government could reasonably be expected to accept. To achieve it he is prepared to exercise extreme pressure, and feels that in a matter in which our rights are so clear we must go straight ahead, dealing with the situation which results ad hoc.* See annexes in CP. 114 (27). [16011] D
4.   As against this course we have urged (a.) That it does not fit in with the general trend of our policy in Egypt.(6.) That even if the present Government could be made to accept it, they could and would soon find a way round the limitations imposed, (c.) That it is, therefore, not worth while exercising pressure and risking a major political crisis to obtain something of doubtful value and durability.That there is a good deal in these considerations Lord Lloyd himself has shown us. When discussing (and rejecting) the policy of insisting on a British Sirdar (and an executive Acting Sirdar is much the same) a year ago he said : &quot; Imposition of British Commander-in-chief upon Egypt, which we have declared to be independent sovereign State, would, even if theoretically justi-fiable, appear to Egyptians and the world generally (and would I think hi fact be) strikingly out of harmony with ensemble of our policy. It would be interpreted as heralding a new and reactionary tendency on our part. Egyptian amour-propre would be publicly affronted (which Egyptians particularly dislike) and a spectacular rallying-point would, be given to our opponents. Zaghlul. I would remind you, stated with general approval, when in office, that to have a foreign Sirdar was inconsistent with Egypt&apos;s new status.&quot; Even though it might be argued that we reserve the right to defend Egypt, this is a claim to use our forces and not in any way to control for this purpose the armed forces of Egypt, otherwise when we retained financial and judicial advisers we should not have omitted mention of such an outstanding post as the Sirdarship. -   &apos;&quot; On present policy it is prudent that British officials should, as far as possible, be technical and advisory rather than executive.&quot; In the event of a future Government having to use the Egyptian army to suppress popular forces of disorder in circumstances where the army may have to appear as being the instrument of one political party against another, the existence of a British Sirdar, though probably welcome to Government, might well prove a source of embitterment and political embarrassment.&quot;*M. M. Ji. Ji. Jt&quot;A&quot; -w- -7v- w w&quot; I am advised that a British Sirdar would have little chance of maintaining a high level of efficiency in Egyptian army unless British officers were reintro-duced into all units, and this is quite impossible. If supported by only one or or two staff officers, a British Sirdar would be as likely as not to fail in his task and our credit would suffer severely.&quot; It is not a British interest in any case that Egyptian army should be effective. What we want to ensure is that it should retain a sufficient spirit of discipline to prevent it from becoming a tool in the hands of politicians.&quot;5. Realising that whatever course is adopted pressure will have to be exercised and a crisis risked, we have advocated aiming at something which would .(a.) Not only fit in with the policy of 1922 declaration but be an earnest of our intention eventually to liquidate the reserved subjects by agreement with Egypt.(&amp;v) Strengthen our own juridical position.(c.) Tend to keep the Egyptian army out of the political arena.The kind of provisional military agreement which we had in mind is shown by the annexed draft. Lord Lloyd and Sir W. Tyrrell may not have appreciated that in aiming at a written declaration of co-operative intent we were not trying to water down Lord Lloyd&apos;s demands. On the contrary, our idea was to leave him full liberty to get the most he could both in regard to fixing the numbers and weapon strength of the Egyptian army and to the numbers and functions of the British officers attached to it, though we think that the principle which Lord Lloyd himself advocated a year ago that these officers should be advisory and technical rather than executive should be respected.6. It may be urged that even if the present Egyptian Government or their successors could be brought to sign such an agreement, they would not respect it. As to this, we can only go by their attitude towards other agreements, e.g., that relating to the officials&apos; compensation law of 1923, which even Zaghlul in the first flush of his
triumph in 1924 refrained from challenging. In any event, if the agreement was not respected, representations which we could base on a breach of definite agreement would be more likely to be effective than those which have no such basis, e.g., our ineffective representations in regard to the 1855 loan.7. Seeing the unanimity with which Ziwar&apos;s Government rejected Lord Lloyd&apos;s proposals a year ago for setting up an Egyptian Sirdar with a certain number of British officers attached in advisory capacities and the declared attitude of the present Government to the same proposals, * it appears unlikely that they will consent except under extreme pressure to agree to make General Spinks acting Sirdar. We believe that no greater pressure would be required to get them to sign a provisional military agreement on the lines suggested and, therefore, that we should go for this rather than the more limited objective.8. In view of Sir W. Tyrrells telegram, the department submit this minute with diffidence. Should the Secretary of State feel that it warrants further consideration, a draft memorandum on the lines of the minute (which I have tried to keep very brief) would be prepared for submission with a view to its circulation to the Cabinet with Lord Lloyd&apos;s despatch and Sir W. Tyrrells telegram.9. There is one other point. If it is decided to approve Lord Lloyd&apos;s proposals as they stand, then, as Sir W. Tyrrell points out (paragraph 3 of his telegram), an immediate decision is necessary. On the other hand, the scheme which we have advocated would not be greatly affected by a decision of the Egyptian Chamber taken before it was launched. In fact, such a decision would provide a suitable ground for demanding the acceptance by the Egyptian Government of our suggested provisional agreement.Foreign Office, April 9, 1927.Annex to Enclosure (C). Suggested Provisional Military Agreement with Egypt.HIS Majesty&apos;s Government and the Egyptian Government, recognising the importance, in their common interest, of effective co-operation in the joint task of ensuring the defence of Egypt by the forces available for the purpose, have agreed upon the following provisional arrangements pending a final settlement: 1. The Egyptian Government undertake to maintain the Egyptian army at a strength of .t    His Majesty&apos;s Government undertake that the availableBritish forces shall be sufficient in co-operation with the Egyptian army and His Majesty&apos;s fleet to protect Egypt from aggression from whatever quarter. As effective co-operation in an emergency depends upon the previous maintenance of close liaison between the two forces and co-ordination in their training, the measures described in the annexed schedule! have been adopted.2. His Majesty&apos;s Government will furnish the Egyptian Government with such instructional and technical personnel, additional to that described in the schedule, and with such instructional facilities as may from time to time be agreed upon by the two Governments. The Egyptian Government will employ no foreign personnel other than British and will not cause their own personnel to be trained abroad except in Great Britain.3. His Majesty&apos;s Government will furnish the Egyptian Government at cost price with the requisite armament, munitions and supplies not produced in Egypt, and the Egyptian Government agree to obtain these from no other source.o* Cairo telegram No. 75, paragraph 7 annex (4) to CP. 114 (27).t Figures to be determined by Lord Lloyd in consultation with G.O.C., Egypt.% The schedule to contain whatever definition of the powers of General Spinks and his colleage-ues Lord Lloyd may be able to make the Egyptian Government accept.
