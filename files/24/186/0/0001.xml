ggAgjg DlSPUgSS MID ffiRADE UKIOF BILL.   . NOfflii BY gHiS MiffIS SB OF LABOUR.SBOBTSg. She objeotions I feel to the proposal to prohibitCP.101(27).      Ordinary strikes in certain trades until there hasbeen a Court of Inquiry may be briefly summarizedas follows1*      They assume that the preliminary negotiations will go on as at present, but there is a grave risk that they will not.     People will not attempt to settle as they do now.     Eeither Bide will put all its crrds on the tp-ble, if it knows that when it has made the best offer it can afford, the other side can bring it before a Court of Inquiry, which may treat that final offer as a starting-point for further concessions. 2.      In all the Industries scheduled, except coal-mining, there is already in existence machinery for dealing with disputes.       hie machinery is steadily developing and improving in effectiveness.     JUhere is in my view no doubt that its usefulness and its development will be impaired by this proposal. 3.     Ivly fears on the above two points are justified by Canadian experience and by what happened in this countryIwhen my predecessor, Mr. Shaw, announced that he would set up a Court of Inquiry in every dispute.     Within a month or two certain unions had begun to use this declaration for tactical purposes and were manoeuvring to see how by means of a Court they could get something which they would be unable to get in the ordinary way.
4.     She main function of a Court of Inquiry is to inform public opinion, and the main object of the present proposals is to give time for informed public opinion to operate.It is quite certain, however, that if Courts of Inquirybecome automatic, the public will take little interestin them, and they will cease to have any deterrent effect upon the disputants, while at the same time the Governmentwill be dragged into a number of disputes which were better loft alone.     .JL Court of Inquiry was set up inJuly, 1925, when a coal strike was imminent.     The minersrefused to attend it, the public took little interest init, and its effect was nil.5.      It does not seem to me sound tactics to couple provisions for dealing with strikes, which in some circumstances may &quot;be justified, with Clause 1(1), which deals with the general strike.6,     All experience shows the impossibility of enforcing penal legislation of this kind in the only cases where it matters i0ef where large numbers of men are involved. It might perhaps be effective where a handful of men were concerned, but the penalties could not be enforeed,for example, in a national railway ::trike or a national docks strike37.      Che change proposed in our industrial system is so drastic, so far-reaching and so uncertain in its effects that it ought not to be adopted without the fullest consideration and only, I should have thought, after consultation with representatives of industry.      It is all very well to say that the public are the biggest sufferers and most need protection, but neither the public nor even the House of Commons can judge as well as industry how the thing will work,(Jhtd,) AaS-M*Ministry of Labour. i^njT March, 1927.
