[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government, j Printed for the Cabinet.   May 1927.CONFIDENTIAL.CP. 144 i,27).ITALY&apos;S SPECIAL INTERESTS IN ALBANIA.I circulate to my colleagues the accompanying papers on the subject of Italy&apos;s special interests in Albania, including a memorandum from M. Mussolini and my proposed reply.A. C.Foreign Office, May 9, 1927.No. 1.Sir Austen Chamberlain to Sir R. Graham (Rome).(No. 87.)(Telegraphic.)   R. Foreign Office, March 31, 1927, 8 p.m.YOUR telegrams Nos. 69 and 71 of the 23rd and 25th March: Italo-Jugoslav relations.I -have accepted proposal made by M. Briand as reported in Lord Cre\ve&apos;s telegram No. 55 to the effect that in order to help bring about a comprehensive settlement of all outstanding differences between the Italian and Jugoslav Govern-ments immediate representations should be made by His Majesty&apos;s Government to the Italian Government, and by the French Government to the Jugoslav Govern-ment, the German Government being kept informed of action taken.After further consultation with the French Government, I have decided that your Excellency should now convey to M. Mussolini the following personal message from myself. You are authorised to make such modifications as you may consider necessary in view of changed circumstances and further developments : &quot; I am much relieved to learn that M. Mussolini considers that his communication to the three Powers has already effected its object and has averted immediate danger. I note with satisfaction that he views the situation with utmost calm and thinks there is no kind of danger of a serious crisis.&quot; In view of M: Mussolini&apos;s opinion that the proposed investigation by military officers on the spot would, as matters have developed, serve no useful purpose, I do not wish to press it. But, on the other hand, I must point out that the very grave and unusual step which the Italian Government thought it necessary to take in calling His Majesty&apos;s Government and the two other-Governments to witness the danger which was threatening the peace of Europe makes it henceforth my duty to apply myself to the task of preventing the recurrence of such an alarm, and this compels me to intervene in a more direct manner than in ordinary circumstances I should have been inclined to do. In view of these very special circumstances, and in consideration of the close friendship happily existing between our two Governments, I trust that M. Mussolini will not take amiss the advice which I feel it my duty now to offer in order to clear up the present dangerous situation.&quot; Although I am glad to think that the incident which gave rise to the Italian Governments recent representations may be considered as closed, it remains evident that, so long as the present strained relations between Italy and Jugoslavia continue, there can be no guarantee that further incidents of the gravest kind may not occur at any time. I am convinced that the obvious and only cure for this dangerous state of affairs is a frank and unconditional inter-change of views between the Italian and Jugoslav Governments in regard to the 3973   [16135] . b
whole situation, including the ambiguous provisions of the Treaty of Tirana, and I am glad to learn that M. Mussolini himself takes this view.&apos;&apos; I would urge that these conversations should be started as soon as possible, and am prepared, if necessary, to facilitate them in any way that lies in my power. I feel sure that in order to hasten a return to normal conditions and to save Europe from a recurrence of the recent alarm M. Mussolini will be reach to take the initiative in opening the discussions without imposing preliminary restrictions or conditions. This should be all the easier since the Jugoslav Government have already taken the &quot;first step by offering to submit their internal affairs to foreign investigation (whicn offer M. Mussolini does not, as it happens, think it necessary to accept).&quot; If any good and lasting results are to come from the proposed discussions, I hold firmly that the Jugoslav Government ought not to be asked to make any further preliminary &apos; gesture.&apos; For instance, it would, in my opinion, be fatal to success and quite unjustifiable in the eyes of the general public for the Italian Government to make the opening of the discussions dependent on the previous ratification of the Nettuuo conventions, which deal with matters entirely foreign to the question at issue. I am prepared, however, to advise, and to ask the French Government to advise, the Jugoslav Government to give the Italian Government, as part of a general settlement, an undertaking to submit the con-ventions at once to the Skupshtina and to use their best endeavours to obtain their ratification. I trust that M. Mussolini will agree that beyond this it would be unreasonable to press the Jugoslav Government.&quot; Further, I must urge that the discussions with the Jugoslav Government should have for their object not some vague and inconclusive formula but a definite agreement on the whole Albanian question, including the mutual control of Albanian refugees, which will put an end once and for all to the mutual suspicions and recriminations which have poisoned Italo-Jugoslav relations ever since the signing of the Treaty of Tirana, and have been the cause of the recent crisis. In this connection, while not questioning for a moment the sincere intention of the Italian Government to do nothing which might impair the independence and integrity of Albania, I think it right to add that the ambiguous wording of the Treaty of Tirana makes it incumbent upon me, in view of recent occurrences, to urge the Italian Government to find some means of defining the scope of the rights and obligations which they claim under this treaty.Lastly, in order to prevent any further incidents during the Italo-Jugoslav discussions, I hope the Italian Government will help me to give effect to the following scheme : If there is unrest on the frontier, or if allegations are made by one or other Government, the British and French military attaches will be ordered to investigate the allegations, if necessary, on both sides of the frontier, so as to check the spread of false rumours which might otherwise disturb the discussions between Italy and Jugoslavia. Germany, not having a military attache at Belgrade, will be invited to give a member of her Legation identic mission and instructions. This scheme will only be in force during the ItaTo-Jugoslav discussions.&apos;&apos;I am asking the French Government, for their part, to urge the Jugoslav Government (1) to instruct their Minister in Rome to use his best endeavours to begin an early discussion with M. Mussolini on these lines; (2) to authorise him to give an undertaking as regards the Nettuno conventions as proposed above; (3) to agree to the British, French and German Governments appointing forthwith investigators as described in preceding paragraph; and (4) to take immediately stringent measures to control Albanian refugees, and to remove them from the frontier districts. His Majesty&apos;s Government will, of course, join in these representations to the Jugoslav Government.You should keep your French and German colleagues fully informed. (Repeated to Paris, No. 71 (by bag); Belgrade, No. 25; Durazzo, No. 21; and Berlin, No. 31.)
No&apos;. 2.Mr: Seeds to Sir Austen Chamberlain.(No. 59.)Sir, Durazzo, April 18, 1927.AMONGST the various declarations made by Albanians abroad during- the recent crisis, that of Bishop Fan Noli which took the form of an interview published in the Vienna &quot; Neue Freie Presse &quot; deserves to be put on record. This former protege^ of Italy now attacks the Mussolini Government, maintains that the Pact of Tirana was imposed on Albania by Italy and Great Britain, and declares that in the event of a war between Italy and Jugoslavia, Albania will be found fighting on the side of the latter, despite all pacts and treaties, in alliance with all the other Balkan peoples. Ahmed Bey, he adds, is thoroughly unjjopular and maintains his position only thanks to Italy.2. The present situation is of course one which ambitious politicians find admirably adapted for proclaiming their programmes in anticipation of the forthcoming Italo-Serbian conversations weakening, or of some more violent event wiping out, the regime of Ahmed Bey. Such programmes must necessarily be of an anti-Italian character. Fan Noli has clone his bit; and so has Tseno Bey, the Presidents disreputable brother-in-law and Minister to Jugoslavia, by his recent declaration to the Belgrade &apos;.&apos; Politika.&quot; But, with whatever justice Ahmed Bey-may be accused by his opponents of having sold himself and his country to Italy, few Albanians would in their more reasonable moments maintain that either of these two candidates was fit to take the place of the present Head of the State. Certainly not Tseno Bey, even though his corruption and his treachery to his brother-in-law in 1925 be regarded as features rather common to Albanian public men. On the other hand, judging by the foreign press and by the reports received from Belgrade such as the despatch No. 21 of the 23rd December last from His Majesty&apos;s vice-consul at Skoplje regarding the feeling among the Albanian exiles, Fan Noli would be justified in adding the title of Prophet to his highly irregular dignity of &quot;Bishop,&quot; as he is apparently not without honour save within the frontiers of his own country. For in Albania itself his short-lived administration is not remembered as a monument of efficiency, while his reputed Bolshevik connections are not calculated to endear him to all. It might here be added that little credence need be attached to his denial, in a recent letter to &quot; The Times,&quot; of the allegation that when he left Albania he carried away some of the national wealth in his trunks.3. While I am myself convinced that the Italians will support Ahmed Bey through thick and thin, at present there is, of course, always the danger that some accident may deprive Albania of her present head. The plot mentioned in my telegram No. 9 of the 25th March has come to nothing, and my observant American colleague in Tirana has noticed a considerable strengthening of the protective cordon round the palace; nevertheless, absolute security cannot be guaranteed. As, however, the Presidents enemies may think the moment propitious for action, it is advisable to consider, at any rate, the possibility of Ahmed Bey&apos;s disappearance and its consequences.4. Quite apart from the personal question of my warm regard for the President himself, such an event would in my opinion be a serious calamity.5. My predecessors have on various occasions stated that Ahmed Bey is irreplaceable and that there is no man of a similar calibre in the country. Before coming to Albania I wholeheartedly shared the opinion then current in the Foreign Office that such statements should be heavily discounted. One has heard in many countries of statesmen alleged to be indispensable, and experience has but too often shattered such illusions. But I am now bound in honesty to confess this much, namely, that I have not yet personally met, nor have I yet had quoted to me by any responsible person, one man fit to step into Ahmed Bey&apos;s shoes. Of the Tirana politicians, the only one with what might be called presidential stamina is Musa Bey Juka, but his personal unpopularity is a fatal obstacle. Consequently, hopes of finding a suitable successor to Ahmed Bey given Albanian methods of regime-changing must be founded on the mere possibility that out of the inevitable chaos and turmoil some outstanding though hitherto unrecognised personality may in time emerge. But parturition will be difficult, and Albania will not be given useful help by her Italian and Serbian midwives, whose efforts will most probably result in the production of twins cursed with a grievous incompatibility of temper and with no very sound constitutions.[16135] b 2
6. Past history would seem to show that Albanian regimes may always be expected to alternate regulai&apos;ly between the adherents of Italy and Serbia. Within the last two years, however, conditions have completely changed. It is no longer a question of what Italy or Jugoslavia may expect to gain from a new President, but quite definitely of what Italy may be almost certain to lose. The advantages promised to the Serbians by Ahmed Bey in return for their assistance at the close of 1924 were paltry in comparison with the advantages which Italy has since gained and must preserve at all costs. A Serbian candidate now would represent, in Italian eyes, a slate washed clean of every Italian treaty or convention from that of the Bank to that of Tirana a disaster of which the financial gravity would be as serious as the political humiliation. The stake at issue is now too important to allow either party to follow precedent and, at the outbreak of the next troubles, to agree with its rival on a policy of common detachment as regards Albanian revolutions. Apart from anything else, both sides have learned by bitter experience the futility of trusting to such understandings. The Italians point to the fact that the Serbians pushed Ahmed Bey into power at a time when M. Ninchitch was, so the Italian Charge d&apos;Affaires states, actually in Rome negotiating such a self-denying ordinance; on the other hand, Italy is accused by the Serbians of exactly similar conduct in connection with the insurrection of last November and the Treaty of Tirana. It will in short be up to both sides to &quot;do their damnedest&quot; the moment Ahmed Bey goes.7. The action which the Italians are likely to take in the matter of a revolution against Ahmed Bey at the present time is too obvious to discuss. The foregoing is only written with an eye to an eventuality which, it is fervently to be hoped, will not occur, but for which it would be unwise not to be prepared. It may be summed up as follows: 8. In Ahmed Bey the Italians have now a valuable and unique instrument; for no other man, so far as can be seen, possesses those personal qualities which can keep him in power without an unduly provocative display of Italian force. Should he disappear, there seems no present chance of either the Italians or the Serbians finding any candidate who would be much above puppet rank&quot;. The struggle between these puppets and their foreign supporters may, or may not, result in the extinction of Albania as an independent State, but bids fair in any event to mean the success of an individual dependent for his existence on very obvious alien bayonets.9. I am sending copies of this despatch direct to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Rome and to His Majesty&apos;s Minister at Belgrade.I have, &amp;c.WILLIAM SEEDS.[C 3785/808/92] No. 3.Note from Signor Mussolini. (Communicated by Italian Ambassador, April 25, 1927.) (Translation.)THE memorandum which Sir Austen Chamberlain has been good enough to communicate to me on the question of Italo-Jugoslav relations has impressed me as a further proof of his friendly feelings towards Italy and of the interest which he brings to bear on questions touching the preservation of peace, wherein, happily, the future of Italy finds its surest foundation.I trust that Sir Austen Chamberlain will perceive in my present reply similar friendly intentions and a like interest. The same clearness with which I shall endeavour to set forth my views should be for him a guarantee of the confidence which he inspires in me : I. Before commencing to examine the suggestions which Sir Austen Chamberlain wab good enough to communicate to me, I must dwell on a point of fact which merits correction. Sir Austen Chamberlain is of opinion that the Italian Government did not accept the procedure of inquiry which was proposed soon after the &quot; exposures &quot;of Jugoslav armaments made by Italy.I hasten to explain that, from the first conversation which I had the honour to have with His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Rome, while emphasising the objections to the enq\iiry, I formally declared my acceptance of the same. In pursuance of subsequent instructions given by me, the Italian Ambassador in London had, later, occasion to confirm to Sir Austen Chamberlain my explicit acceptance of
the above-mentioned procedure, on condition, however, that it should, embrace all the items to which attention was drawn by the Italian Government and not merely some of them, and those the least susceptible of verification.II. Another point to be explained concerns the nature of the demarche made by the Italian Government, not only vis-d-vis the Governments in London, Paris and Berlin, but also those at -Washington, Athens, Sofia, Budapest and Bucharest, when they had to invite attention to the Jugoslav armaments. The despatch which the French, the German and particularly the British Government displayed in considering what action might be taken on the Italian indictment has led to the assumption that the procedure adopted should be interpreted as the intention on the part of Italy to place the solution of a dispute in the hands of certain Great Powers.It is well therefore to be explicit on the point. The Italian Government have no quarrel with the Jugoslav Government and have not drawn the attention of friendly and interested Governments to the existence of a dispute. They merely desired to ensure the correctness and the good faith of their action in notifying to the said Governments a decidedly anti-Italian tendency on the part of Jugoslavia, which was evident from military preparations which Italy regarded as dangerous, not so much in substance, but solely owing to their attendant details which revealed premeditation and the decided tendencies of certain political and military circles in Jugoslavia possessing great influence, both open and secret, in that State, tendencies which constitute a grave danger to peace since they are driviug the Serb-Croat-Slovene Government to an intense military preparation to which Italy has not opposed and will not oppose counter-measures, but which not being in actual fact justified by the present political conditions in the Balkans, must be interpreted as having aggressive aims.What end had I in view in bringing these facts to light ? Before everything else I wished to establish responsibility in view of possible future developments of events; secondly, I desired, far from creating a dispiite, to eliminate in good time the possibility of one.Italy has been happy to note that these results have been fully achieved, seeing that, while it now seems improbable (though certain recent reports would indicate the contrary) that Jugoslavia desires to persist in stimulating the proposed spring invasion of Albania, no one could doubt the responsibility of that State if the said invasion, or any other military incident whatever, should, in spite of j all, be let loose from her territory.The cycle of the Italian denunciation having thus been exhausted,, the said notification did not seem to admit of any further sequel. It is true that there remained on foot a protest by the Jugoslav Government which, rejecting the accusations made against them, demanded the test of an enquiry. The Governments which did not wish to leave unheeded the attempt at defence made by the Jugoslav Government would, logically, have had to face these three hypotheses: 1. Either they considered the Italian statements as well-founded and had only to note them, or, in addition, address a warning to Jugoslavia ; or . They had no private information on which to form an opinion, in which event they could institute the enquiry, provided that it was swift and complete ; or3. They considered without more ado that the Italian denunciations were unfounded and consequently had only to acknowledge the entire absence of danger.None of these solutions was followed. On the one hand Jugoslavia was given to understand that the danger declared by Italy was considered to be without foundation, and on the other hand Italy was advised to enter into negotiations with J ugoslavia as if the outbreak of the conflict were imminent.I am anxious calmly to correct this error of judgment, and to redirect to its proper objective the purpose of the Italian notification, which was a considered warning given to all the interested States regarding a tendency which might lead to a conflict. Hence no devaluation of that tendency but no over-estimation of the conflict.ill. Sir A. Chamberlain will understand the necessity under which I labour of thoroughly clarifying these points before i submit to him my views on the proposals contained in his memorandum. The essence of these proposals may be recapitulated thus: 
1. Direct conversations between&apos;Rome and Belgrade having for their object, not a &quot;vague and inconclusive formula, but a definite agreement on the whole Albanian question.&quot;2. Suggestion to the Italian Government to find &quot; some means &quot; of defining the scope of the rights and obligations which they claim under the Treaty of Tirana.3. Constitution of a commission of vigilance on the Jugoslav-Albanian boundary in order to prevent incidents happening during the conversations between Rome and Belgrade. This commission would be composed exclusively of one French and one British officer, plus a &quot; civilian &quot; official of the German Legation at Belgrade, but of no agent of any of the other countries to which the notifications of the Italian Government were addressed.IV. I have never refused and I am prepared to discuss with Jugoslavia the whole question of the relations between the two countries. Sir A. Chamberlain speaks of an agreement on the entire Albanian question. I consider, however, that the agreement to be sought concerns the entire Italo-Jugoslav question.Assuming that a settlement of the whole question of italo-Jugoslav relations should be considered, it is evident, but in any case I think it desirable to state it candidly at once, that, as regards the Albanian question, the same must be considered in the light of its actual settlement under international law, and that, therefore, as no discussion is possible on the agreements concluded between Italy and other States concerning Albania, any discussion on thoss, such as the Pact of Tirana, concluded between Italy and Albania, is likewise absolutely inadmissible except with the view of the acceptance by Jugoslavia of their undisputed validity and full efficacy.The pact in question, concluded between sovereign States and registered with the League of Nations, constitutes for Jugoslavia res inter olios acta. It is not for Italy to give account to third parties of her international relations. As a member of the League of Nations, Italy has accurately complied with her obligation to register the treaty with the League of Nations and, by excess of scruple, she also added thereto the declarative note annexed to the treaty.V. If the military preparations of Jugoslavia denounced by Italy had as their object to bring pressure to bear upon Italy to modify the present Albanian situation laid down by existing international agreements, then it would be the method least adapted to be crowned with success. It will be said that these armaments and attempts do net exist. Then why is it desired to exert pressure on Italy to avert a danger which does not exist ?In any case, Italy does not believe that these attempts to exert pressure can find encouragement and condonation in the atmosphere of justice and peace which happily surrounds international relations.VI. Although Sir A. Chamberlain is entirely aware of the vital importance of the Albanian problem to Italy, I think it nevertheless desirable to establish clearly the point of view of the Italian Government in order that his Excellency may note that it is for Italy a problem of security, and therefore one with regard to which there can be no compromise. This was recognised by the declaration signed at Paris on the 9th November, 1921, which is for Italy the Adriatic Statute, and from the Paris Declaration Italy cannot recede, nor does she intend to do so.The Pact of Tirana is the recognition of the pre-eminent interests of Italy in Albania, but the pact, having been freely and spontaneously signed by Albania, acquires greater validity and equity..VII. Moreover, what right has Jugoslavia to demand explanations ? Because, perchance, she borders on Albania ? Greece also borders on Albania. Italy will perhaps have to make explanations to all the States marching on Albania, or, rather, must confine herself to giving explanations to an armed and threatening Jugoslavia and ignore a silent and circumspect Greece.VIII. I certainly owe to Sir A. Chamberlain, on account of the ties of high esteem and warm friendship which bind me to him, some enlightenment on certain parts of the Pact of Tirana which may have claimed his attention.The most discussed clause of the Pact of Tirana, and the one to which evidently Sir A. Chamberlain has been called upon to give his attention, is that in which Italy declares her interest in the maintenance of the political status quo in Albania. Tins clause has been interpreted as an obligation to support the present internal regime.
I declare, firstly, that I do not see why an undertaking to avoid internal changes in Albania can give greater cause for alarm than the liberty which others arrogate to themselves of engineering such changes from abroad.Italy has no reasons of her own for interfering in the internal politics of the Albanian State.In recent months the Albanian Government changed their system sevoral times without any direct or indirect Italian influence.Let us, however, now see whether Jugoslavia does likewise. The object which she aims at is clear : to make herself the stage manager of nth Albanian revolution, overthrow Ahmed Zogu, annul the Italo-Albanian treaties and conventions, interrupt the peaceful and civilising work which Italy has undertaken in Albania, and make Albania a State practically, politically and, perhaps, territorially vassal to Jugoslavia.She aimed at this in December, 1924, when she overthrew Fan Xoli and brought back to power this same Ahmed Zogu, whom she regarded as a pliant tool in her hands. M. Nincic, whose Government was then on terms of perfect cordiality with the Italian Government, saw no disloyalty in that; he himself boasts of it in Ins interview in the &quot;Matin &quot; of the 15th February, 1927. In face of the danger that these intrigues are indefinitely renewed to the serious detriment of European peace, Italy claims her right and duty to protect and defend friendly regimes-a course which Great Britain has largely pursued throughout her history.This state of affairs, moreover, does not owe its origin exclusively to the. Pact of Tirana.The declaration signed at Paris makes provision for it. In article 3 it says : &quot; en cas de menace contre l&apos;integrit  ou 1&apos;independance aussi bien territoriale qu&apos;economique de 1&apos;Albanie du fait d&apos;une agression etrangere ou de tout autre evenement . . . .&quot; The possibility is thus contemplated of a menace to the independence of Albania not arising from external aggression but from any other incident whatsoever.The case i8 also envisaged of a threat to her economic independence. Did not these hypotheses therefore entirely deal with domestic events in Albania beyond the integrity of her frontiers and any aggression ?IX. By her recent &quot; denunciation &quot; Italy desired precisely to show that without having recourse to a military application of the Pact of Tirana, there is always and first and foremost the possibility of its pacific application. In this even the Pact of Tirana must, as already stated, he understood as a felicitous complement of the 1921 Declara-tion, seeing that, while the latter cannot be applied except to re-establish by means of intervention a situation that is compromised, the Pact of Tirana permits, as far as possible, a preventive and, consequently, a pacific solution. Such has been the case with the timely warning given by Italy, who has declared her desire not to disturb the peace of Europe, and to make the Pact of -Tirana a diplomatic instrument capable of settling in a satisfactory manner the possibility of a conflict. Had this not been the case, if the intentions of Italy had been other than pacific, it would have sufficed for the Italian Government to have allowed events to take their course in order to have a reason for intervening in Albania.X. Certain passages in Sir Austen Chamberlain&apos;s memorandum refer to the good-will which the Jugoslav Government are said to he disposed to show towards the Italian Government by promising to lay before Parliament the conventions of Nettuno and to do all in their power to have them approved. Sir Austen Chamberlain considers that it would not be fair to demand more. The Jugoslav Government would therefore only have to make this simple promise. Bxit the Government of Borne have no question pending with the Belgrade Government. That which preoccupies the Italian Government is not the more or less sincere acceptance of the provisions which, indeed, constitute international obligations, but whose value always depends upon the spirit in which they are applied. It is rather the state of mind which is prevalent in Jugoslavia, the latter being taken in its entirety of people, Government, Parliament and more or less lawful or oblique classes of irresponsibles. Must, Italy therefore, in the development of her historical problems, ignore the existence of these hostile forces and rest satisfied in face of a Government which, though in good faith, masks the underground work of the military factions which preach war and hatred against Italy ?XL The Italian Government, viz., the Fascist Government, was the one which inaugurated a policy of friendship with Jugoslavia. It would have gone much further along this road, but the Jugoslav Government have lagged far behind and for two years have marked time.
The conditions for resuming the path &quot;towards a general settlement are that Jugoslavia should accept, without diplomatic or, worse still, military discursions, the situation in international law now perfected in regard to Albania which has been constituted by the Paris Declaration of 1921 and the Pact of Tirana, which situation guarantees the independence of Albania and does not threaten in the least Jugoslavia or any other State bordering upon Albania.Italy casts no aggressive glances either in the Adriatic or elsewhere. Italy has to work to &quot; reconstruct herself,&quot; and has, moreover, to devote herself to the creation of her new internal regime. She is peaceable and desires to work in peace, but she does not intend to endure the manoeuvres which develop fatally every time she seeks to guarantee her own security.It giveB me pleasure to believe that Sir Austen Chamberlain will be convinced of the entire political good faith of Italy, her desire for tranquillity and the logical conclusion of those matters which I have set forth in the present communication, as well as the solemn declaration that Italy will do nothing which may disturb the peace-of Europe.Rome, April20, 1927.[C 3785/808/92] No. 4.Sir Austen Chamberlain to Sir R. Graham (Rome).(No. 624.)Sir, Foreign Office, May 9, 1927.AS I informed you in my despatch No. 549 of the 25th April the Italian Ambassador handed me on that date a memorandum from M. Mussolini on the subject of Italo-Jugoslav relations. This memorandum has now been translated, and I enclose a copy herein. *2. On careful consideration of M. Mussolini&apos;s remarks, it seemed evident to me that they contain certain statements which it would be undesirable for me to pass over in silence. The first statement to which I must take exception is the allegation contained in section 1 of his Excellency&apos;s memorandum, that &quot; Sir Austen Chamberlain is of opinion that the Italian Government did not accept the procedure of an enquiry.&quot; As your Excellency is aware, there is no justification for this assertion, seeing that in the message which I instructed you to convey to M. Mussolini the actual words used were : &quot; In view of M. Mussolini&apos;s opinion that the proposed investigation by military officers on the spot would, as matters have developed, serve no useful purpose, we do not wish to press it.&quot; This was an entirely accurate statement of the position, and, in my view, M. Mussolini has no cause for complaint in the matter.3. Again, since section 2 of M. Mussolini&apos;s memorandum seems to imply that the scope and object of his representations of the 21st March have been misunderstood, I wish to make it clear that the fault, if fault there be, does not lie with me, but is due to the inability of the Italian Ambassador to enlighten me on the subject. More-over, M. Mussolini himself, I might add, does not seem in his various conversations with you to have attempted to supplement the very inadequate information at the disposal of the Marquis della Torretta. In any case, M. Mussolini must not continue under the impression that I misinterpreted his communication of the 21st March as meaning that Italy intended to place the solution of the dispute in the hands of certain Great Powers.4. At the end of section 2 of the memorandum it is stated that &quot; Jugoslavia was given to understand that the danger declared by Italy was considered to be without foundation.&quot; There is no justification for this assertion, and I feel bound to contradict it.5. I also consider it necessary to contradict the insinuation in section 5 to the effect that I have taken advantage of the representations of the 21st March to bring pressure to bear on the Italian Government.6. The most serious part of the message, however, is that which appears in section 8. In this section M. Mussolini, for the first time, definitely states in writing that he interprets article 1 of the Treaty of Tirana as entitling him to interfere to protect and defend any friendly regime in Albania, not merely against foreign aggression, but presumably also against internal opposition. This claim to interfere in the internal administration of Albania is precisely the claim which the Jugoslav Government have all along feared, and which they consider would constitute a threat* See No. 8.
\to their own security by converting Albania from an independent country into an Italian protectorate.  It was, indeed, adumbrated by M. Mussolini in conversationj with you on the 2nd April, but I felt justified on that occasion in discounting it as having been made without due reflection at a moment of considerable irritation. But in M. Mussolini&apos;s memorandum under review his Excellency now defines his claim in such a manner that it becomes impossible for me to treat it otherwise than as representing the official and considered policy of the Italian Government.] 7.   The claim thus forcibly made has raised, as you will readily understand, a problem of considerable importance, especially in the light of the policy which I enunciated in my note to Marquis della Torretta of August 1926 (see &quot; South-Eastern Europe,&quot; August 18, Section 1). In paragraph 4 of that note I stated &quot; whilst His Majesty&apos;s Government have never suggested that Italy should not exercise there &quot; (i.e., in Albania) &quot; the influence to which her importance and her proximity entitle her, they have consistently declined to admit, as is made clear by the circumstances in which the resolution was drawn up and by the text as finally signed, that any Power should enjoy there any exclusive interest. .... Such remains and must remain the consistent policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government, not from any selfish motive, but from the conviction that such a claim by any Power would be viewed with suspicion by third parties and might lead, however baseless the suspicion, to a situation not unlikely to endanger peace.&quot;8. In view of the definite policy referred to above, M. Mussolini&apos;s statement of policy in his recent memorandum has put &quot;me in a position of some difficulty. Three courses were open to me : (1.) I might make no comment on the claim now officially formulated and tacitly reserve the right of His Majesty&apos;s Government to protest if and when the Italian Government do take some action which can be held to constitute unjustifiable interference in the internal administration of Albania as defined in my note to Marquis della Torretta of August last.(2.) I might definitely remind M. Mussolini of British policy and give him to understand that in the circumstances His Majesty&apos;s Government are unable to accept or approve the present Italian claim.(3.) I might tacitly acquiesce in the claim and justify my acquiescence on the ground that the situation has fundamentally altered since I formulated the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government in August last.9. Of these solutions the first did not appeal to me as I considered it an unsatisfactory evasion of the difficulty which might easily lead to trouble for His Majesty&apos;s Government at a later date. The second solution was the one which at first commended itself to me as the most consistent and logical, but against these merits I had to set a violent reaction which it might provoke on the part of M. Mussolini and the encouragement, which, if it came&apos; to the knowledge of the Serb-Croat-Slovene Government, they might derive for the adoption of an uncom-promising attitude, and the consequences to Albania and all concerned of any fresh revolution in that country. While I was considering these three solutions I received Mr. Seeds&apos; very illuminating despatch No. 59 of the 18th April last and this finally convinced me that, having regard to the internal situation and the recent develop-ment of Italian policy in Albania, it would be in the best interest of His Majesty&apos;s Government no longer to assert the view that they will not suffer Italy to interfere in the internal government of that country in order to ensure the continuance of a Government friendly to Italian interests. I have all along held that His Majesty&apos;s/ Government have no direct interest in Albania, and I have made it clear that the only reason why I desire to see Italian penetration in Albania confined within certain limits is that, if unlimited, it would arouse the fear of neighbouring States and thereby endanger peace. It now seems that what is still more likely to endanger peace, in view, of the circumstances clearly set forth by Mr. Seeds, is the disappearance of Ahmed Bey and his Government. I am obliged to recognise the fact, as stated by Mr. Seeds, that, should Ahmed Bey disappear, the result is likely to be civil war, during which Albania as a separate State might cease, to exist or become subject to a puppet Government still more dependent on foreign bayonets than the present one. In fact, the fall of Ahmed would aggravate to an incalculable degree the conditions likely to lead to a direct and open conflict between Italy and Jugoslavia. In these circumstances, it appears evident that the. cause of peace, which His Majesty&apos;s Government have at heart, will be best served by the maintenance in power of Ahmed&apos;s Government, even though the means to be employed to effect this[16135] c
object is the determination of the Italian Government to support him against all attacks. Were His Majesty&apos;s Government now to veto M. Mussolini&apos;s policy of supporting Ahmed&apos;s Government against both internal and external aggression/and were he subsequently to be overthrown, it is not difficult to foresee the Italian arguments whereby His Majesty&apos;s Government would be held responsible for the resulting chaos and the consequent damage to vital Italian interests, and even for the eventual conflict between Italy and Jugoslavia.10. I have therefore decided to adopt the third course outlined above, and I enclose herein a memorandum in reply to that of M. Mussolini handed to me on the 25th April last, which I request that you will deliver to his Excellency as a personal message from myself, explaining that on consideration of his memorandum 1 came to the conclusion that there were certain points which required a reply, and that I feel sure that this exchange of views will be generally beneficial to the cordial relations so happily existing between His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Italian Government. I am communicating a copy of the enclosed memorandum to Signor Bordonaro for his Excellency&apos;s information.11. In conclusion, I desire to express to your Excellency my warm appreciation of the manner in which you have throughout the last few months kept me informed of the feeling in Italy on this subject. The able despatches with which you have furnished me have facilitated very considerably my task in reaching a decision on this difficult question of policy.I am, &amp;c.AITSTEN CHAMBERLAIN.Enclosure in No. 4. Pro-posed Memorandum for Signor Mussolini.SIGNOR MUSSOLINI&apos;S message on the subject of the relations between Italy and Jugoslavia has been most welcome to me. It affords renewed proof of his friendly feeling towards this country and of his readiness to co-operate with us in our efforts to strengthen the basis on which peace in Europe rests, and it gives me once again the assurance^ not indeed necessary, but always most welcome that he reciprocates the sentiments of personal friendship and confidence which I entertain for him. I set so high a value on these relations, both national and personal, that I hasten to remove two misapprehensions to which my message of the 2nd April appears to have given occasion.2. I regret to learn, for instance, that Signor Mussolini should be under the impression that I abandoned the idea of a commission of investigation into the military situation of Jugoslavia on the ground that the Italian Government had refused to accept such a procedure. If I did not press for an enquiry, it was, as stated in my message, because I understood Signor Mussolini&apos;s opinion to be that the proposed investigation would as matters had developed no longer have served any useful purpose. I certainly never supposed that Signor Mussolini was opposed in principle to the procedure of an investigation, but I confess that I had gathered from the report furnished me by Sir R. Graham of his conversation with Signor Mussolini on the 23rd March that the President of the Council considered that his communication to the various Governments had already effected its object and had , averted all immediate danger, and that he therefore thought it no longer necessary, or useful, since it had not been instituted at once and by surprise. It was because of these considerations, which appeared to me entirely convincing, that I dropped my proposal for an investigation, but I was never in any doubt as to Signor Mussolini&apos;s acceptance of this procedure if I had pressed for it.3. I regret that I appear to have misunderstood the scope and object of Signor Mussolini&apos;s communication conveyed to me by the Italian Ambassador on the 21st March. But here I think that the fault, if fault there be, was not mine. The Marquis della Torretta when conveying this communication was unable to give me any explanation of the object which the Italian Government had in view in making it. Nor was his Excellency in answer to my enquiry able to tell me whether and if so what other Governments had received a similar communication. I subsequently learned from the French arid German Governments that they had been similarly notified, but until receipt of Signor Mussolini&apos;s present message I was unaware that the notification had also been addressed to the various States bordering on
Jugoslavia and to the United States Government. In any case Signer Mussolini may be assured that I never interpreted his communication of the 21st March as &quot; representing the intention on the part of Italy to place the solution of a definite dispute in the hands of certain Great Powers. On the other hand, Signor Mussolini, knowing as he does the earnest desire of His Majesty&apos;s Government for the maintenance of peace, must appreciate my anxiety on receiving such a serious warning, and cannot, I am confident, misinterpret the effort which his communication appeared to invite and which I therefore felt bound to make in furtherance of the object which we both have in common the elimination of all causes of international friction. Although for various reasons it was not possible to apply any of the solutions suggested by Signor Mussolini in his present message, I hope that Signor Mussolini will agree that the advice which I ventured to offer in my message, namely, that a solution should be sought by means of direct and frank conversations between himself and the new Jugoslav Minister, was dictated equally by my sincere desire to serve the cause of peace and by my consideration for the dignity and interests of Italy. But I feel bound in this connection to correct a misunderstanding under which I am sorry to observe Signor Mussolini to be labouring. He appears to think that while offering the above advice to the Italian Government, I was simultaneously giving the Jugoslav Government to understand that the danger feared by Italy was considered to be Avithout foundation. Signor Mussolini will be glad to know that no such intimation either direct or indirect was at any stage made by His Majesty&apos;s Government to the Jugoslav Government.4. At the same time, I would like to take this opportunity of expressing to Signor Mussolini my gratification at receiving his assurance that he is prepared to discuss with Jugoslavia the whole question of the relations between the two countries. I fully share his view that the agreement to be sought must cover the entire Italo-Jugoslav question, but I still hope that in the course of the conversations and as part of a general settlement it may be possible on the basis of the Pact of Rome for the two Governments to reach some mutually satisfactory arrangement regarding their relations towards Albania. But I trust that Signor Mussolini will not think that in making these or any suggestions I am exploiting the circumstances of the moment in order to try in any way to bring pressure to bear on Italy. I am distressed to learn that Signor Mussolini should have ever entertained such an idea and have attributed to me any other objects than those which I enumerated in the House of Commons as recently as the 2nd May, when I stated that my sole aim has throughout been to remove possible causes of friction, and that His Majesty&apos;s Government, having no other interest in this question than the preservation of peace, have no intention of taking sides in the controversy5. For this reason I would prefer not to follow Signor Mussolini in his interpretation of the Treaty of Tirana, nor in his examination of the possible implications of the Ambassadors&apos; Conference resolution of November 1921 and of its relationship with the provisions of the above treaty. It is for the present sufficient that all the Governments concerned in this question, and not least Italy and Jugoslavia, profess to pursue the same policy of maintaining the integrity and independence of Albania.6. As for the immediate problem of how best to reconcile Italy&apos;s and Jugoslavia&apos;s conceptions of this their common policy, I feel convinced that with goodwill on both sides it ought not to be impossible for the resources of Italian and Jugoslav diplomacy to find a statesmanlike solution, which will dispel the misunderstandings and suspicions which have engendered the present unfortunate friction between the two countries. It is in this conviction that I take note with particular satisfaction of the very frank and precise assurances with which Signor Mussolini&apos;s message concludes, namely, that the situation created by the Ambassadors&apos; Conference resolution of 1921 and by the Treaty of Tirana guarantees the independence of Albania and does not threaten in the least Jugoslavia or any other State bordering upon Albania; that Italy casts no aggressive glances either in the neighbourhood of the Adriatic or elsewhere; and lastly, that Italy will do nothing which might disturb the peace of Europe. It is so that I have throughout understood and interpreted his policy.
