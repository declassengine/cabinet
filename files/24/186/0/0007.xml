SAFEGUARDING OF INDUSTRIES,REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE OnTABLE-WARS OF TRANSLUCENT POTTERY.To the Right HonourableSir Philip Cunlif fe-Llater, K.B.S. ,M.C .,M.P., President of the Board of Trade.Sir,1. We were appointed on the 6th October, 1926, to be a Committee to enquire into and report upon an application made by the British Pottery Manufacturers&apos; Federation for the Imposition of a duty under the Safeguarding of Industries procedure as outlined in White Paper Cmd. 2327, on Tableware of translucent pottery^2. We have held 23 meetings  and have taken evidence In camera on two occasions.   Evidence was heard from 38 witnessesi (See Appendix C), 20 being called by the Applicants and 18 by the China and Glassware Section of the London Chamber of Commerce, who opposed the application.3. The constituent Association of the Federation concerned in the manufacture of goods of the kind to which the application relates is the English China Manufacturers1 Association.4. Both sides were represented by Counsel,, Mr. W.Barnard Faraday, instructed by Messrs.. Llewellyn and SOn, appearing for the Applicants,  and Mr. A.S. Comyns Carr,. K.C., and Mr. C.F. Sntwistle instructed by Messrs. Stikeman and Company on behalf of the Opponents.5. Our terms of reference were limited to tableware of translucent pottery but at the outset of the enquiry the Applicants indicated that they desired to apply for a duty
on all translucent china with the exception of laboratory porcelain and parts of dolls; but in view of our terms of reference we were not prepared to extend the scope of the enquiry to such an extent.    We, therefore, asked the Applicants to submit a detailed list of the articles in respect of which they were applying and which would be covored by our toras of reference.&apos;   This list is reproduced as Appendix A.6. The English china Manufacturers&apos; Association represents -43 out of the total of 53 firms engaged in the production of the class of goods to which the application relates. Tho 10 firms outside the Association were also stated to be in agreement with the application. There are in addition a number of firms engaged solely in the manufacture of various kinds of china of superlativo quality and artistic merit, but we understand that these firms do not suffer from serious foreign competition at the moment and consequently were not parties to the application.    The application was opposed by the China and Glassware Section of the London Chamber of Commerce, whose members are substantially interested in the matter as importers and wholesale distributors of the goods in question.7. The manufacture of the class of chinaware with which the application is concerned is mainly carried on in and around Longton, Staffordshire, and in the trade is generally known as &quot;Longton&quot;  china.    The main contention of the Applicants was that, so far as the class of chinaware manufactured at Longton was concerned, trade was seriously affected owing to the importation of chinaware from suoh countries as Germany and Czecho-Slovakia, and that it was impossible under present conditions for British manufacturers to produce at prices at which foreign goods were being offered for Bale in the United Kingdom.
8. The Applicants contended that although the foreign Imports were not identical they were similar in character with the British production. They also stated that the various classes of china and earthenware may to a large extent be substituted one for the other and consequently foreign imports of any grade of china into the United Kingdom affect detrimentally the sale of similar British articles whatever their grade of manufacture.    In this way the imports of ohina may affect the production of earthenware and vice versa. This view was not accepted by the Opponents who maintained that the great bulk of the imports were of a distinctive kind and were not in competition either direct or indirect with the British China industry, although they admitted that such imports might reasonably be expected to affect the British Earthenware industry.9.  In support of this argument the Opponents urged that whereas the British China industry used bone ash as an important constituent of their product, the whole of the foreign imports were composed of &quot;felspar&quot; china in the production of which no bone ash is used.    They further main-tained that if the British Ohina manufacturers were to substitute &quot;felspar&quot; for &quot;bone ash&quot;  and would adopt similar methods of manufacture to those followed on the Continent in place of the old-fashioned methods mainly in use here,  they would, owing to advantages enjoyed by them in various directions, experience little difficulty in meeting foreign competition in the articles concerned.    On the other hand, the Applicants asserted that the manufacture of felspar china in this country would not offer any substantial advantage over the manufacture of bone china and that the British factories were on the whole working on the most efficient basis possible,
S3The applicants further maintained that the hours of working, wages and other labour conditions in certain competing countries abroad were inferior in many respects to those obtaining in the United Kingdom, and together with other artificial advantages (i,e. lower taxation, protection of home markets, etc.) afforded material assistance to the foreign china manufacturers and so plaoed them in a specially advantageous competitive position.    Furthermore, they stated that chinaware of foreign manufacture but of the shape and bearing the patterns in nee by English firms had recently appeared on the English market together with trade mark devices inferring that the ware was British    (such as the Staffordshire knot), and English mottoes and wording.10o We now proceed to a detailed consideration of the various questions on which we are   asked to report, as contained in paragraphs (l) to (8) of Section II of the White Paper:-(l) Whether the applicant industry is, by reason ofthe volume of employment engaged in the production of the goods to which the application relates, or by reason of the nature of the goods produced, an industry of substantial importance.11. The Applicants contended that they manufacture an article in universal request, indispensable in utility, and necessary alike in its many varieties to domestic life, and that altogether apart from the number of persons employed in the manufacture of such goods, the industry is one of substantial importance.   This contention was not seriously contested by the Opponents.12. According to figures published by the Ministry of Labour the   number employed in the pottery industry as a whole
in December 1926, was 35,220 males and 38,590 females or 73,810 persons in all.    No definite information is available from official sources showing the number of persons employed in the chinaware section of the industry alone. The applicants were urable to give particulars as to the numbers employed by all the 53 firms engaged in this section of the industry, but submitted estimates which were basod on actual returns received from 36 firms.   According to these estimates the number of persons employed was 7,818 in 1913, 7,272 in 1925, and 7*244 in 1926.13, It was also claimed that in addition to those directly employed in the china section of the industry, many subsidiary industries such as the mining of coal and clay, the manufacture of special tools, appliances and machinery, the preparation of colouring material, certain sections of the chemical trade, the manufacture of transfer papers, the milling of potters&apos; materials, the manufacture of packages, were dependent upon the prosperity of the china industry, and that practically the entire district around Sfcoke-on-Trent, with a population of about 250,000 was dependent upon the pottery industry..,14, In considering the numbers employed In the China Section it is, however, necessary that it should be borne in mind that we are dealing only with a section of a much larger industry in which considerably larger ziumbers are employed and we have, therefore, to consider tho possible effect on this larger industry of any serious curtailment of the output of the section with which we are specially dealing and the consequent dislocation of employment which would ensue. This particularly applies to the question of apprenticeship and training of new vjorkpeople.
d x15. On account of the foregoing considerations we are of opinion that both by reason of the number of persons employed and also having regard to the nature of the goods produced the applicant industry is entitled&apos;-to be regarded as an industry of substantial importance.(2) Whether foreign goods of the class or description., to which the application relates are being Imported into and retained for consumption in the United Kingdom in abnormal quantities.16. It was contended by the Applicants that the imports of those articles in which tho applicant industry is concerned were shown in the United Kingdom trade returns not only under the heading &quot;Chinaware&quot; but were also Included under the &quot;Earthenware&quot; headings.    This fact was not disputed by the Opponents and evidence was produced showing that certain consignments which were in fact 11 China ware&quot; , were imported into this country described as &quot;Earthenware&quot;, and there is no doubt that they were entered under the latter description in the trade accounts.17. In 1913 the headings under which details of imports were given were Prooelain, Chinaware and Parian and Other Earthenware (including Semi-Porcelain and Majolica), but a number of changes have recently been made in the classification as shown in the following table.1920 to 1924.Porcelain, Ghinaware and Parian:-(a)  one China and Parian.(b) Hard Porcelain.I. For Laboratory Use. II, For Industrial Purposes  (excluding insulators) and III. Other Sorts.General Earthenware, Semi-Porcelain and Majolica(a) Jet, Rockingham, Samian and Other GlazedEarthenware (except Terra-Cotta).(b) Other Sort3, including Unglazed Red Pottery,Brown and iellow ware and Terra-Cotta ware.
18.    These changes introduce obvious difficulties into the comparison of the statistics for different years.    It would appear, however, that the imports of &quot;tableware&quot; are covered by the following headings:-1920 to  1924.I. Bone China and Parian,  II-. Hard Porcelain - Other Sorts and III. General Earthenware, Semi-Porcelain and Majolica - Jet Rockingham, Sarnian and other Glazed Earthenware (except Terra-Cotta).1925.I. China and Translucent Pottery, (a) Bone China, (b) Other Translucent Pottery and II. General Earthenware,  Semi-Porcelain and Majolica.I.

9 0Translucent Pottery, including all pottery known as China or Porcelain other than Hard Porcelain and II. General Earthenware (except high grade Earthenware resembling china) Semi-Porcelain and Majolica.19.   As already indicated, in addition to imports under the foregoing headings a considerable importation of articles of the kind with which we are concerned is recorded under1 the &quot;Earthenware&quot; headings and some difficulty has occurred in ascertaining the proportion of the earthenware imports which should be taken into account.    Our attention was drawn to the quantities of chinaware exported from Germany and Czecho-Slovakia to the United Kingdom,    In each of these two countries the Customs classification employed in the respective trade returns appears to include headings which cover in the main only chinaware of the description we have under considera-tion and from figures produced it would appear that the quantities of chinaware exported to the United Kingdom account for approximately 90 per cent, of the goods included under the heading &quot;General Earthenware&quot; in the United Kingdom trade returns.    The Applicants suggested, therefore, that it was a fair assumption that nine-tenths of the imports of &quot;Earthenware&quot; were in fact chinaware with which we are concerned.2o. Taking the year 1925 the exports of &quot;Porzellan&quot; or China from Germany and Cz echo-Slovakia to this country were 287,813 cwts.  of which 1,933 cwts. were recorded In the Board of Trade Returns as for Laboratory or Industrial purposes, thus leaving 265,880 cwts. for tableware and other household articles.   Against this total the import figures record 3,2 00 cwts... as Cnina and 280,370 cwts. as Glazed Earthenware, other than Jet, Rockingham and Samian Ware, or 283,570 cwts.
in all.    In dealing with these figures the Opponents drew our attention to the fact that the foreign export figures were gross figures including weights of packages, and also comprised a certain proportion of goods which though invoiced to this country were destined for consumption in countries other than the United Kingdom.21. In Appendix B will be found full particulars of the Imports and Exports of the various classes of Chinaware and Earthenware, but. the following summarised table prepared on the basi3 outlined above, shows the net imports during the period 1909 to 1915 and 1920 to 1926 and the relationship between those net imports and the corresponding figures of the British production and Home consumption of this class of chinaware.    The figures of production are as supplied by the Applicants.

22.   From this Table it will be observed that the net imports have grown rapidly during the last six years and are now above the average for the years 1909 to 1913.    On the other hand the total British production for the same period has steadily declined and now represents only about three quarters of the 1913 standard.   An even more marked fall has occurred in the quantities produced for home consumption, though the export trade has been materially assisted by the preferential tariff rates in the Dominions.    Taking the relationship of the net imports to the total British production, which is the best criterion for judging the effect of foreign competition on the British industry, it will be seen that in 1926 the percentage of net imports to the total production was 199 as against 133 in 1913, whereas in 1922 the peroentage had fallen to 95.    Even if it be contended that the year 1926 is not a normal year nevertheless in 19^t5^ the peroentage was 150 as compared with 1913, although the total imports by weight in 1913 were in excess of those of 1925.    It should be pointed out that the British production for 1926 is based on the actual output during the first four months of the year only and consequently does&apos; not take into account the subsequent reduction in output which took place later in the year owing to the coal strike,23. Whilst we recognise that the British, and foreign china are composed to some extent of different materials and are made by somewhat different methods, we are unable to accept the contention of the Opponents that imports are of a non-competitive character as we are satisfied that from the point of view of the ultimate purchaser they are both &quot;china&quot; and as such are interchangeable.    We are, therefore, of opinion that, having regard to all the circumstances foreign imports of
0 &apos;1similar goods to those to which the application relates are at present being imported into and retained for consumption in the United Kingdom in increasing quantities and that such quantities are now abnormal..(3) Whether the foreign goods so imported are being sold or offered for sale in the United Kingdom at prioes which are below the prices at which Bimilar goods can be- profitably manufactured or produced in the United^ingdom.24.   A range of samples whioh were claimed to be representative of the principal British and foreign articles were submitted to us by the Applicants with particulars of the prices of the foreign goods as charged to the importer and of the cost of production of similar British articles.    These samples tended to show that there was an appreciable but varying margin between the foreign price and the corresponding British cost of production.   For example, in the case of an ordinary white and gold teacup and saucer, the foreign import price was given as about 3/3d. per dozen, whereas the cost of making a similar product in this country was at least 5/-per dozen.    In another case a 21-piece tea set imported at about 7/6d. was stated to cost ll/9d. to produce in this country, the cost in materials and labour alone being over 8/-. In other instances the difference was more marked so that, to take an extreme example, children&apos;s mugs, imported at about 2/- per dozen were stated to cost from 7/3d. upwards to make in this country.    Detailed costings in support of the British figures of production were furnished to us, and it was main-tained by the Applicants that the difference between the British and foreign prices was mainly, if not entirely, due
similar goods to those to which the application relates are at present being imported into and retained for consumption in the United Kingdom in increasing quantities and that such quantities are now abnormal..(3) Whether the foreign goods so imported are being sold or offered for sale in the United Kingdom at prices which are below the prices at which similar .goods can be prof itably manufactured or produced in the Un1ted Kingdom^24.   A range of samples whioh were claimed to be representative of the principal British and foreign articles were submitted to us by the Applicants with particulars of the prices of the foreign goods as charged to the importer and of the cost of production of similar British articles.    These samples tended to show that there was an appreciable but varying margin between the foreign price and the: corresponding British cost of production.   For example, in the case of an ordinary white and gold teacup and saucer, the foreign import price was given as about 3/3d. per dozen, whereas the cost of making a similar product in this country was at least 5/-per dozen.    In another case a 21-piece tea set imported at about 7/65.. was stated to.cost ll/9d. to produce in this country, the cost in materials and labour alone being over 8/-. In other instances the difference was more marked so that, to take an extreme example, children&apos;s mugs, imported at about 2/- per dozen were stated to cost from 7/3d. upwards to make in this country.    Detailed costings in support of the British , figures of production were furnished to us, and it was main-tained by the Applicants that the difference between the British and foreign prices was mainly, if not entirely, due
9 1940 the cheaper cost of labour abroad.    An examination of the figures relating to the costs of production in England as compared with Czecho-Slovakia and Germany shows clearly that apart altogether from the question of the actual wages paid per operative, the total amount^ expended.on labour abroad in relation to output is considerably lower than in this country, but in view of the fact that the cost of materials and firing of the ware was very considerably less abroad than in this country, we cannot subscribe to the opinion that the difference in price is entirely due to the cost of labour.    In both cases, however, the labour cost represents approximately 50 per cent, of the total cost of production. - The Opponents asserted that the lower labour costs in Germany and Czecho-Slovakia arose from the use in those countries of Improved methods of production which resulted in a much greater output per operative.     They stated, by way of example, that in Czecho-Slovakia, one skilled workman with thirteen assistants could turn out by means of automatic machinery 4,800 pieces per day as against about 360 in this country made by one man by ordinary hand methods.25.   Reference has already been made to the difference in the nature of the materials used in foreign countries.    It was contended by the Opponents that, given the necessary enter-prise, similar materials could be used here and that in conse-quence the mass production methods in vogue on the Continent could be adopted by British makers.   On the other hand representatives of the British bone-china makers as well as the expert witnesses - Dr. Mellor and Mr, Bernard Moore -asserted that in their opinion the adoption of mass production methods to bone-china manufacture was not a practical proposition.    One British manufacturer stated that some years
ago his firm installed automatic machinery, but after experiments ranging over three years, were compelled to scrap it as it was not considered efficient for making good china. Similarly with regard to the three-tier oven used on the Continent, it was claimed that its use in this country was impracticable.26.   The Opponents, as already indicated, also urged that the imports of felspar china were really competitrw? with the British earthenware industry and not with the bone-china trade, and suggested that the export of British earthenware might be detrimentally affected by reason of the fact that if a duty were placed on the import of foreign felspar china into England some portion of the output of the foreign factories would as a consequence be diverted &quot;to other markets.    In this connection it is necessary to bear in mind that 85 per cent, of the whole output of the Czecho-Slovakian factories is exported, and in some factories it is as high as 93 per cent. We were also furnished with information which would tend to either show that a larger proportion of the lower grades of chinaware produced in Germany is exported to Great Britain as compared with other countries or that lower prices are being charged to this market.      For, example, in the year 1925 the export value of chinaware sent from Germany to the principal consuming countries was United States  76 per ton, Italy  75 per ton, Holland  36 per ton and Great Britain  51 per ton.    In addition evidence was given that the whole of the &quot;Seconds&quot;  of one continental factory was exported to this country.27.    We are aware that there is some agreement among the English bone-china makers which includes the fixing of minimum selling prices but owing to the numeroue graduations,of
quality and the large Bale of &quot;Seconds&quot;, it is clear that nothing in the nature of &quot;ring&quot; prices exist.28.    In all the circumstanoes, therefore, we are of opinion that articles, which although not manufactured from identical materials enter into direct competition with the Applicants&apos; industry, are being sold or offered for sale in the United Kingdom at prices at which it is not possible under existing conditions to produce similar articles in this country.(4) Whether, by reason of the severity and extentof such competition, employment in the manufacture or production of such goods in the Uniteol Kingdom is being, or is likely to be, seriously affected.29. As already indicated, the total number of persons employed In the section of the industry with which we are conoerned was just over 7,000 in 1926, the detailed figures for the year 1913, 1920-19S6, being as follows: -Male. Female. Total.1913............ 3,049 4,769 7,8181920 ............ 3,109 5,192 8,3011921 ............ 3,093         .    5,188 8,2B01922 ............ 3,029 4,891 7,9201923............ 8,832 4,762 7,5941924 ............ 2,720 4,685 7,4051925 ............ 2,654 4,618 7,2721926 ............ 2,623 4,621 7,244From this table it will be observed that both as regardsmale and female workers the numbers employed have progressivelydeclined during this period.30.   No separate figures of unemployment are available for the china section, but the percentage of unemployment in the pottery trade during the year 1926 ranged from a minimum of 13.2 per cent,  in April to 58.6 per cent, in June, 1926. The
figure for the latest month available is 16.5.    Undoubtedly the high percentage of unemployment in the summer of 1926 was due, to a considerable extent, to the coal strike, as the pottery industry is more directly dependent on adequate coal supplies than most industries;    in fact, the industry uses more ooal per ton of output than any other industry.    The average for the year 1925 was, however, 16.2 per cent. Evidence was also placed before us that certain British manu-facturers had worked short time since 1922.31.   Ihe Opposition, whilst not denying the existence of extensive unemployment in the Longton area, contended that such unemployment could not be attributed to excessive imports, but that on account of the high price of bone-china the demand for this article on the home market was very restricted and its use had been replaced very largely by English earthenware.32.    In view of the evidence put before us by both sides we do not feel able to accept the suggestion that any replaoament of bone-china by earthenware fully accounts for the decrease in the volume of china produced and the consequent prevalence of unemployment in this section.    Having regard to the general average of unemployment in the whole of the pottery industry during 1925 (16.2 per cent.) and further, as it was demonstrated to us that during 1925 and 1926 the level of unemployment in the china section was as a rule higher than in other sections of the&apos; pottery industry we are of opinion that at least a contributory factor in the present unemploy-ment is to be found in the extent to which foreign china is at present being imported.33.   We therefore return an affirmative answer to this question and are of&apos; opinion that unemployment in the Longton area will continue to remain on the present abnormally high
level, so long as the present volume of foreign imports is maintained.(5) Whether suoh exceptional competition comes largely from countries \vhere_ the conditions are so different from those in this country as to render the competition unfair. Competition for the purpose of such enquiry is not to be deemed to be unfair unless it arises from .one or more of the following causes:-(a) Depreciation of currency operating so asto create an export bounty.(b) Subsidies, bounties, or other artificialadvantages.(c) Inferior conditions of employment of labour,whether as respects remuneration or hours of employment, or otherwise, obtaining amongst the persons employed in the production of tH** imported goods in question as compared with those obtaining amongst persons employed in the production of similar goods m the United Kingdom.34.    In the main the competition to which the bone-china industry is subjected comes from Germany, Czecho-Slovakia and Japan, and to a much lesser extent, and in specialised ware, from France.   Owing to the stabilisation of the currencies of Germany, Gzecho-Slovakia and Japan, which are the three oountries from which practically all the imports emanate, we do not consider that any present advantage is afforded to these countries on account of currency depreciation, though there was some evidence that certain foreign factories had been re-equipped since the war and prior to the stabilisation of the currency.    Similarly, no evidence was given which demonstrated that any subsidies, bounties or other artificial advantages exist in any of the foreinn competing countries.
&apos;1 d35.   The Applicants stated that the average rates of wages for men and women employed in the china section of the industry in the United Kingdom were about  3. 9s, 9d, and  1.12s.9d. per week, respectively for a full 47 hour week.    The&apos; average hourly rates were ls.5.82d, for men and 8.36d. for women.    On the other hand they asserted that in Germany wages for skilled men were between 8-gd. per hour in the case of time workers and lOd. per hour for piece workers, while skilled female workers ranged between 5d. and 5-ld. per hour.    There was some disagreement as to the actual hours worked in Germany but as far as we are able to ascertain the 48-hour week is legally in force, though provision is made for the working of overtime without increase in rates of pay during the first 5 hours worked after 48 hours.36.    It was established that in Czecho-Slovakia the 48 hour week was strictly observed but the average wages of an adult workman was stated to be about 30/- per week.   According to evidence given the wages in certain German factories were 22/lOd. per week or 5.71d. p^r hour and 28/lOd. p^r week orv7.2d. per hour, according to the district in which the particular factory concerned was situated and in czecho-Slovakia ae low as 2l/8d. per week or 5.4d. per hour.37.    In view of the difficulty in obtaining reliable evidence as to the actual wagos paid abroad v/e have boon guided to some extent in considering this question by reports obtained through the Department of Overseas Trade, which showed that the general level of wages in the pottery trade in Germany and Czooho-Slovakia is considerably lower than in this country.38. Having regard to the evidence put before us by both sides and the information obtained independently in the reports referred to in the preceding paragraph, we are satisfied that
the actual wages paid in Germany and Czecho-Slovakia, which are the two countries from which the competition mainly comes, are at present considerably lower than in this country and that this difference is such as to render competition from these countries unfair within the meaning of the Section,i6) Whether the japplicant industry is being carried on in the Unitod Kingdom with reasonable efficiency and ,economy.39.     The Committee are pleased to note that it was agreed by both the Applicants and the Opposition that the quality of English bone-china was maintained onehigh level, and that so long as the margin of difference in price between English and foreign china was not too great the former would always command a market.    The Committee were also impressed with the cordial relations which exist between employer and workpeople end the fact that there had been no serious industrial dispute in the industry during the last 25 years.    A Joint Industrial Council is in existence which regulates all questions relating to wages, hours of employment, conditions of labour,  etc.     There is also a British Pottery Manufacturers&apos; Federation which, without interfering with the purely domestic concerns of Individual manufacturers, deals with matters which are of Interest to the industry as a whole,  such as the encouragement and utilisation of improvements in methods of. manufacture, exploiting of inventions and patents, research, and all matters connected with economic production.     For example, a Committee of the Federation has carried out detailed investigations into all types of pottery firing and is at present conducting research into the possibilities of alternative methods of firing in substitution for coal.   The Federation takes a great
interest in the Pottery School and the Stoke School of Art, which schools are both devoted entirely to the training of students destined for the pottery trade.     The Opposition, whilst disclaiming eny desire to cast any aspersion upon an important British industry, maintained that the methods of manufacture and marketing followed by English manufacturers were conservative in the extreme and were capable of considerable improvement.40.     The production of pottery is a highly technical operation, and, although we have had the advantage of visiting represent at ive British china works, we do not feel competent to decide or to express an opinion on such a debatable point as the possibility of the installation of automatic machinery or conveyors, the use of which, it was urged by the Opposition, would result in considerable economies in manufacturing costs.41,     Evidence   was given by technical experts that, not-withstanding the fact that the pottery industry had been oarriad on in the Stoke district for generations and that consequently a good deal of old property and equipment exists at present, the methods employed by British manufacturers were highly efficient and further that every effort is made to adopt labour-saving devices or machinery whenever they are proved to be of service.    In all the important works the essential parts of the ovens are maintained thoroughly up-to-. date, and it was stated that in some respects the methods of firing employed at Longton were more satisfactory than at some continental works.42.      On the faots before us wa hesitate to express a definite opinion on the possibility of establishing a fels-pathic china Industry iri this country, but we suggest that a complete investigation of the question, both on technical and
economic grounds, should be undertaken at once, in the light of existing conditions, under the auspices of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, especially as we consider that it has been demonstrated that this particular type of china manufacture is more adaptable to mass production methods and the use of automatic machinery.43.     Prom such a limited survey as we have been able to make it would appear that some economies might be effected if a number of small firms who are at present  endeavouring to maintain separate organisations, both manufacturing and selling on a very reduced output, could be induced to pool their resources and work on a co-operative basis.     Under existing conditions these small firms are obviously unable to devote the necessary capital expenditure to the maintenance of their works on the most modern lines possible, whilst their overhead charges must be a very serious item in their costs of production. We strongly urge, therefore, that every effort should be made by the industry to place these small firms in a more satisfac-tory competitive position.     With this object in view we suggest that the advantages of large scale production and co-operative selling should,  if possible, be obtained either by amalgamation or grouping of small factories or in some other way i/iilch may be determined by the trade after full consideration of the problem.44.      In all the circumstances, however, we are of opinionthat the industry as at present organised is being carried. - . &apos;on with reasonable efficiency and economy.
A 7(7) Whether the Imposition of a duty on goods of the class or dascription in question would exert a seriously adverse effect on unemployment in any other industry, being an industry using goods of, that class or description in production.x45.      In the main the articles which form the subject of thepresent application are utilised by the general public andthere are no industries which are either dependent on orsubsidiary to the china industry.    It was pointed out to us,however, that there is a limited amount of china-ware importedfor use by silversmiths for mounting purposes.    Such tradecannot be regarded as of any volume, and we do not consider itwould be detrimentally affected by the imposition of areasonable duty on imported china-ware.46.     We considers therefore, that there would be noadverse effect on employment In any other industry by reasonof the imposition of a duty on the articles forming the subjectof the present application.(8) Whether, having regard to the above conditions, theapplicant Industry has, in the opinion of theCommittee ^ established a claim to a duty;  and if so, what rate or rates of duty, in the opinion ofthe Committee., would be reasonably sufficient tocountervail the unfair competition.47.     At our request the Applicants submitted a detailedlist (which is reproduced in Appendix A), of all the articles which they claimed came within the scope of their application.On these articles they asked for a   duty of 33i per cent.3We feel, however, that we are unable to accept t&amp;e applicants 
A Qproposition in its entirety.    Prom the evidence it is clear that foreign competition is most severe as regards cups saucers, mugs,plates and tea sets, which articles comprise considerably more than half the Applicants&apos; output; competition does, never-theless, exist in the other articles produced by the &quot;Longton&quot; china manufacturers, but having regard to ell the relative factors we suggest that only articles of pottery of e similar nature to those referred to in the preceding sentence should be brought within the scope of any duty imposed, that is table-ware of the kind normally comprised in breakfast,dinner, tea, dessert and coffee-services or otherwise provided for use in connection with the service of food or drink.     We do not think a duty should be placed on articles such as flower bowls and vases, the ordinary use of which is for decorative purposes48.      Although translucency is a feature of the material about which the complaint has been made,  it is possible with very slight modification in the method of manufacture so to alter the character of the ware as to render it practically non- translucent.    There is, however,   another and perhaps more definite feature of the material we are considering, that is, its body is vitrified.    This fact distinguishes the material definitely from earthenware,   and we recommend that if a duty is levied on articles of the kind referred to above, it should include all such articles of translucent pottery and vitrified pottery.      In practice, at present the vitrified pottery is translucent and we make this recommendation only in order to ensure that the duty, if imposed,  shall continue to have Its intended effect.     We do not think the definition will cause any difficulty in administration as s triple tests are readily applicable to determine whether any particular sample of pottery is either &quot;translucent&quot; or has been &quot;vitrified&quot;.    For example,  if the outline of a coin in close contact with the
articles, can be seen through a piece of pottery when placed within two Inches of a 40 candle-power lamp, the pottery can be said to be translucent;    and if the body of the pottery Under the glaze i3 non-porous (for example, if it does not absorb ink) it is vitrified.19.The Opponents drew our attention to( the fact that an ad valorem duty on certain classes of china, particularly the higher grade china as imported from the Royal Copenhagen Porcelain Factory and certain china from Japan would bear very heavily on a specialised trade In which British makers do not find competition so severe as it is in the ordinary lines. We have, consequently, considered the possibility of a specific duty and have come to the conclusion that a duty of 28s/- per hundredweight would be approximately equal to an ad valorem duty of 33^/5 per cent, on the main classes of pottery to which the application relates.     We recommend, therefore, that a duty of 28s/- per cwt. on the net weight, should be imposed for a period not exceeding five years, on all articles of translucent pottery and vitrified pottery which are normally included in breakfast, dinner, tea,    dessert or coffee services or which are&apos; otherwise suitable for use in connection with the service of food or drink.     This period will give the Applicants an opportunity by reason of the possibility of increased output of improving their, competitive position, and also of investigating the practicability of developing the manufacture of Felspar China in this country..     We realise that such a rate of duty would not countervail the difference in price between all the foreign and British articles, but we consider, that it will provide sufficient safeguard in so far as the main standard lines are concerned.  .  The duty should not extend to any mountings of metal.

50.In conclusion we desire to place on record our sense of appreciation of the very great assistance rendered to us by Mr. F.W. Hammond who has acted as Secretary to the Committee. The oare with which he has obtained information and the industry in which he has recorded statistics has been invaluable to us and the discharge of his duties has been characterized by high ability and never failing good humour.We have the honour to be.

R. a P 0 R Tb yMR,. GEORGE HAYHURST, J.P.I regret that I am unable to see my way to sign the foregoing Report,  principally on the ground that in my opinion felspar china is essentially different in character from the bone-china produced in this country.   I agree that the manufacture of translucent pottery is an industry of substantial importance as it employs about 8,000 operatives and produces goods to the value of about  1,250,000 per annum.    I am not satisfied, however,  that translucent table-ware is being imported into this country in abnormal quantities.   As explained in the Chairman&apos;s report, it is very difficult,  owing to the alterations in the classifica-tion of the imports as given in the Trade Accounts, to obtain reliable figures showing the actual imports of translucent china, but in my opinion the fact that the totals imports by weight in 1915 were in excess of those in 1925 makes it impossible to regard the present imports as abnormal.As already indicated 1 regard the imports of felspar china as being entirely different in character from home-produced bone-china, though it is true that as regards translucency, design and use,  the two products might be deemed to be similar.   Both as regards the body and the glaze there is a marked difference between Continental china and bone china.    The body and glaze of the continental china are both made from china clay,  felspar, and quartz, whilst in the English product the body and glaze differ considerably as follows --2 6-
Body mixture.Glaze mixture.Chinas layChlnacstoneBone.China-elayChina^staneFlint.Lead oxide.There are alao wide differences in the method of firing employed on the Continent and those in use in this country. The costs of some of the materials used in England (in particular calcined bone and lead oxide) are much more expensive than the corresponding ingredients used in making the Continental product, and in view of this difference in the materials used no compari-aon can be made as to whether Continental China ia being sold at prices below those at which similar goods can be profitably manufactured in this country.     Further, I do not consider that it has been established that the severe unemployment in the applicant Industry is due to the importation of foreign china.I agree with the Chairman that no evidence was given that there were any subsidies, bounties, or other artificial advantages in any of the competing foreign countIres concerned, or that any advantage was now being derived by these countr5.es by way of depr*eciation of currency.     On the question of conditions of employment, whilst remuneration in actual wages is lower in Germany and Czecho-Slovakla than in England, certain other factors such as payment for holidays, etc., tend to minimise this difference, and In my opinion, the evidence submitted did not show that, taken as a whole, the conditions of employment abroad were sufficiently inferior to those in this country as to render the competition unfair.It was submitted by the opponents that competition from similar articles of English earthenware was responsible for the falling off in the demand for English bone-china.     Samples *f earthenware cups and saucers were produced, which could not be
distinguished from felspathic or bone-china except for their transluoency*     The shape and decoration were similar in every respect and the ultimate purchaser would, as a general rule, be influenced by price *     The applicants submitted a statement showing the difference in prices between English earthenware and foreign ohina,  In which it was shown that the earthenware prices more closely approximated to felspar china than the English bone-china.     Prom the evidence produced it was pleasing to observe the rapid progress which is being made by the English earthenware industry under the same Trade Union conditions as to wages, hours etc., as govern the bone-china trade.     In ray opinion the progress which has been made by the earthenware manufacturers is the result of the more efficient methods employed by them as compared with those followed by the Longton china manufacturers. This progress in the earthenware industry has been largely achieved at the expense of the applicant industry.So far as the English bone-china industry is concerned, I am of opinion that there is room for great Improvement in certain directions, as for example, in the lay-out of factories, and the greater use of tunnel kilns, particularly for decorative purposes.     I am also convinced that it would be of great advantage if the manufacture of felspar china were undertaken in this country.I would refer to the evidence given on behalf of the opponents to the effect that the price for certain bone-china  , teasets increased from 3s.9d. pre-war to 13s.2d. present day. This factor of high prices in itself must considerably retard trade and the development of industry, and relief must be sought for largely in the greater efficiency and economy of working.During the course of the enquiry there has been an evident reluctance on the part of the witnesses appearing on behalf of
the applicants frankly to table certain details in support of the application, and in this connection the failure of witnesses to produce balance &apos;sheets for the inspection of the Committee indicates a lack of confidence in the Investigating Committee.In support of my contention that the applicant industry has not been so adversely affected in its trading operations as alleged. I would refer to the Inspection by the Committee of a certain Pottery in Lcngton which during recent years has consistently shown reasonable profits, though even in this case the organisation of the Factory was not all that could be desired.Having regard to the opinions expressed above. I do not consider the applicants have established a claim to a duty.(Sgd).    Geo. Hayhurst.
