Printed for the Committee of Imperial Defence.   April 1927.SECRET.Copy No.9CP. 113 (27).(Al*o C.I.D. Paper No. 785-B and CCS. 71.)COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE.Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee.THE SITUATION IN CHINA, APRIL 1, 1927.Report by the Chiefs of Staff.WE met this afternoon, Friday, the 1st April, at 3 p.m., to consider the reply by Admiral Sir Reginald Tyrwhitt (Appendix) to Admiralty telegrams No. 655,* dated the 30th March, and Nos. 658-9,* dated the 31st March, asking for his views on the proposals contained in our Report of the 29th March (Paper No. C.O.S 69).We submit the following recommendations : &apos;(1.) If the forts at Wusung are a danger to the defence at Shanghai they should be dealt with at once and destroyed. This question is quite independent of the Nanking ultimatum and its sanctions.(2.) The proposal to include in an ultimatum the withdrawal of all Chinese armed forces other than police from an area within 12 English miles measured from the mouth of Soochow Creek is not recommended for adoption, as we have not the force required for the defence of so large an area. The conditions, owing to the intensive propaganda behind the lines and the difficulties of dealing with a large hostile population, are far less favourable than they were at the time of the Taiping rebellion, when we understand this step was taken.(3.) We support the proposals of the Chief of the Imperial General Staff in favour of sending further reinforcements to China.Pending the reply by the Naval Commander-in-chief to telegrams sent by the Admiralty asking some further questions for purposes of elucidation, we are unable to discuss the wider question as to how pressure is to be put upon the Cantonese if they should decline to comply with an ultimatum.(Signed)BEATTY.G. F. MILNE.H. TRENCHARD.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1, April 1, 1927.[15975a]* Not printed.
APPENDIX.Copy of Cypher Telegram from Commander-in-Chief, China, to Admiralty,No. 923. dated March 31, 1927.(No. 923.   State.)ADDRESSED to Admiralty; repeated to British Minister, Peking. Your No. 655,* your No. 658,* your No. 659.*While I agree that forcible measures must be taken, if necessary, to enforce ultimatum, this is tantamount to war, and I cannot concur as to feasibility of your proposals. Reference to your No. 655 (a), interruption of troop movements and stoppage of Chinese traffic on Yang-tsze amounts to internal blockade and cannot be effected without engaging forts. Any co-operation by other Powers is improbable until their nationals have Keen evacuated from the Yang-tsze. Any [ 1 direct] interference with operations by Southern forces against North will not be to our advantage. I strongly advise that if forcible action is taken it should be in the form of a definite operation against definite points. It should bring us some concrete advantage. Its successful achievement must be quick rather than protracted, and when completed such that it cannot be denied or misrepresented to the world by propagandists.   I suggest (a.) The seizure of Wusung forts, including Shihtzulin. (&amp;.) The seizure or neutralisation of Chinese naval forces.This will entail employment of several of His Majesty&apos;s ships. Both these are advantageous to foreign Powers. Forts can be destroyed before they are evacuated. In the case of Wusung it will add greatly to security of shipping entering Wusung, which may become a vital point as regards food supply. After consultation with General Duncan, we recommend ultimatum should include at Shanghai the with-drawal of all Chinese armed forces other than police from the area within a radius of 12 English miles measured from the mouth of Soochow Creek and the subsequent military occupation by foreign armed forces of such points within this area as may be deemed necessary to ensure the security of Shanghai. The number of police mentioned above shall not exceed those employed in said area on 1st January, 1927. The advantage of this is that it would safeguard present position at Shanghai, which other Powers, particularly Japanese and French, will probably insist upon as a con-dition before agreeing to any action elsewhere. The seizing Boca Tigris and Dane Island forts has not been suggested on account of paragraph 2 of vour No. 659.* 2128/31.Nod printed.
