COAL.SIR A. NXMMO regarded the position in the coal industry as certainly much less satisfactory than it had been a month ago. The problem of finding an outlet for the output was increasingly difficult.   It was quite true, as mentioned by Mr.Alexander Shaw (see Section on Shipping), that the exports of coal v/ere better than a month ago, but the Increase vras not very vrall spread over the different districts, and it was in some of the export districts In particular that the distress was most to be found.   Values of coal had been falling pretty well all over the country and in some of the districts they had fallen to v/hat one might almost call a tragic level.   The Scottish ascertainment for March had worked out a loss of practically  160,000, and the wages of the miners in Scotland had been reduced by I/&apos;- a day from the 1st May.    That was a matter of very great regret to the emplo7/ers.    It was understood to be much the same on the north east coast v/here there was also very great distress, but in fact the fall In the value of coal seemed really to be reflected in every district of the country.Sir Adam had mentioned before that the coal industry believed they were bound up with the other industries of the country, and had been anxious that these should receive as cheap coals as could be provided, in the hope that a forward and expansive movement would very soon be In evidence; but unfortunately that movement was too slow to assist the coal Industry.   The other industries would probably not complain now that they were not getting coal cheap enough, but they had their own difficulties,  as Mr. Bond had mentioned (see section on Iron and Steel).   Any forward Industrial movement in the country, such as had been anticipated, was likely to be too slow to be really of material assistance to coal.Our coal export difficulties were,Sir- A.Nimmo thought, most pronounced at the present time in the Baltic, and he had mentioned in his letter which was reproduced in the minutes of the last Council meeting that those difficulties appeared to be of a very permanent character and very difficult to overcome. There was no doubt that the competition of Polish Silesia was very severe, and v.e were asked to confront difficulties there which we seemed to have very little chance of overcoming^ because the Polish Government, having made a profit out of the -v/orking of their railways due to tfcofc stoppage of the coal output in this country, had used tie profit to subsidise still further the railway rate to the Baltic ports.   They were now carrying coal about 350 miles for a less rate than we paid, in many districts in this country, for not exceeding 20 miles.    In addition to that, the labour cost of a ton of Polish coal at the&apos;present time did not exceed 3/-, the wage of the Polish miner per day being not more than 3/-.   In Scotland the total cost of production for the month of March was rather over 13/-a ton, the charges other than labour cost being something like 4/6d.   If 4/6d. v/as subtracted from say 13/-, the result would give the labour cost per ton in Sir A^Iimmo^ own district.
COAL (CONTD. ) .He did not know how that position was to be met.   He had always been a -believer in trying to stand up to difficulties, but it looked here as if the odds were going to be very much against us.   Except- in the case of France, there had been an increase in the export trade in coal in all the other coal producing countries, and that was a fact of some significance.In regard to employment, the figures he had, showed that in March there was an unemployment percentage of 16.Q%, which compared with I6.1;i in February, and with 9.3  in March 1926.IRON AND STEEL.MR BOND observed that, as he had indicated at the Council meeting at the beginning of last month, the production of iron and steel In this country during March had been on a very high scale.   The production of pig iron was 671,000 tons, as compared with 568,000 tons in March of the previous year, and the production of steel 949,000 tons, compered with a corresponding figure of 734,000 tons for 1926.   Those figures for this year were very satisfactory so far as they went, but the imports of iron and steel in-March were 478,000 tons, and our total exports were only 353,000 tons, of which more than one third was represented, presumably, by sheets and tin plates, showing that the volume of the export trade for the rest of the iron and steel industry was rather small.   The imports in March 1926 had been 258,000 tons and our exports 406,000 tons.It was rather difficult to gauge the future position, because undoubtedly there was a large accumulation of orders in the heavy iron and steel industry, they had been very much behind in delivery, and naturally buyers would not place fresh orders until those order^s had been worked off.   It was not possible to indicate that the prospects of the iron and steel industry at present showed any improvement.   The output remained at a high level, but Continental steel was still coming into this country in large quantities at very low prices.    Negotiations were In progress on the Continent with the object of putting.the export&quot;price on a higher level.   The present export prices were admittedly unsatisfactory to continental producers, but at present the competition between them, particularly in Belgium, Luxemburg and France, v/as very ieen and, in spite of the European Pact, the price of semi-finished materials was about the same as it had been 12 months ago.     As the Council were probably aware, the German steel v/orks had paid their fine for over-production under the Pact for the Quarter ending last year, and it was understood that during the Quarter ending March 31st they had exceeded their tonnage by 800,000 tons.
IRON AND STEEL (contd..)Galvanised sheet and tin plate industries, which played a big part in the iron and steel industries, were both very quiet.   As regards tin plates, there was an insufficiency of business at present to absorb the high rate of production of the last few months, and quite a number of mills were Idle.It was unfortunate that we did not remember sufficiently that our&apos;s was a highly industrialised country, and that our people were dependent on a prosperous Industry for their well being.* In the Iron and steel trade the situation was viewed with considerable concern.    On the one hand the cost of living was much higher in this country than in many other countries, and on the other there was no doubt that the longer hours of working on the Continent, and the fact that in Germany the cost of wages per ton of material produced were only 60?o of ours, and in Belgium and France only 50 , made it very difficult for us to compete.No industry had been more disorganised, naturally, than the iron and steel industry by the stoppage last year, and those engaged in it had^had a very strenuous time in getting their businesses started again.   Many of them were alive to the fact that a better organisation was absolutely necessary, including both sides - the employers and employed.    The closer co-operation of everyone concerned was the only hope for putting the Industry Into a better state.STxfiELSIR ARTHUR BALFOUR wrote :-&quot;The Sheffield trade during April has fluc-tua-bed considerably, but on the whole has been better than dut-tjig. March.    The home trade, that is orders from shipbuilders and heavy engineers, has certainly Improved.   .The price of coke still remains above the pre-strike price in the best qualities to the extent of 6/-.    The rolling mills and forges have been better engaged generally, although prices are still very fine; and, in view of the cost of fuel, profits are not yet being made.    Empire markets, particularly Australia and Canada, have been good.    Conditions in China are naturally very bad, and the Shanghai and Tientsin business has almost stopped, although a certain amount of business is coning from Hong Kong.    South American business has been better, and we have been successful in competing with Germany and France in Argentina and Brazil.    The hack-saw trade, and the twist drill and milling-cutter trades are decidedly better.    Speaking generally, we can give a rather more cheerful account than on the last occasion, but business is not as good as it was in February.   Alloys are being sold quite extensively and for Immediate consumption, which is a good sign.&quot;
NON-FERROUS METALS.SIR CECIL BUDD wrote:-&quot;I am sorry to have to report very quiet conditions in almost all departments of the Non-Ferrous Metals industries.    I think the home trade is fairly well maintained, but the export side leaves much to be desired. Drooping metal prices may account in part for the dearth of orders, but Far Eastern affairs and other developments abroad are in my judgment mainly responsible.&quot;ENGINEERING.MR. BROW.NLIE was only in a position to reiterate to some extent what he had said last month.    The published figure of unemployment among the members of the Amalgamated Engineering Union for the month of April was not yet to hand.    There was, however, no reason to think there had been any deterioration in the condition of the trade as shown by those figures, but on the contrary It was believed that a further gradual improvement would be indicated. That was the opinion they entertained at the Head Office of the Union in reference to the general engineering industry; and Mr. Brownlie hoped to be in a position to say something more definite when the Council met again on 31st May.SHIPBUILDING AND MOTOR MANUFACTURE.SIR JOHN THCRNYCROFT stated, with regard to ship-building, that it was, of course, well known that British shipyards were better employed than they had been at this time last year, but then they v.ere in a deplorable state. At the end of last year and the beginning of this, orders seemed to be coming in pretty well, but the rate had not been maintained and there was little chance of securing work with any margin of profit.    At the joint conference of Engineering Industries last vveek Mr. 5?.L.Kichens had said that slowly but surely our foreign trade in shipbuilding was.slipping away.THE PRESIDENT remarked that from the last return of Lloyd&apos;s Register it appeared that in the March auarter we had not only commenced a larger number of ships of ICO tons and over than in the quarter before, but that these rspre-sented a larger proportion of the tonnage commenced through-out the world in that quarter.     It appeared, indeed, that
CONFIDENTIAL. SHIPBUILDING AND MOTOR MANUFACTURE. (CONTD.)in the March quarter we had commenced 427,000 tons more than In the previous quarter.   Unless the whole of the increase was to British orders, which it certainly was not, the figures did not seem at all to bear out M^KicherE^s observations./Figures extracted from Lloyd&apos;s Register quarterly return (copy given at the end of this Paragraph) were subsequently handed in, showing an appreciable increase in the tonnagp of vessels under construction for foreign countries^SIR JOHN TEORNYCROFT went on to say that the Chilean Government order had been placed In this country after very keen foreign competition.   Argentine cruisers had been placed in Italy, but their destroyers contracts had not yet been settled.    There was no doubt that questions of design had influenced the placing of the Chilean order, but to secure it, it had been necessary to quote without any margin of profit and to undertake most exacting guarantees.    Sir John did not desire to exaggerate the importance of securing foreign warship orders to be built in this country, but he did not think it was generally recognised what a large amount of work they had provided for the shipyards and engineering works in pre-war days.The British Engineers&apos; Association was in touch with practically every branch of the industry in the country on the business side, and from the information at its disposal it seemed that too optimistic a view of the prospects of the Industry should not be taken.    The figures showing production costs, which the Engineers and Allied Employers had produced for the discussion on the national wage question, were instructive and showed the very small margin of profit on which they were working.    They did not know how that margin was to be generally increased.The Motor Car section was undoubtedly the most prosperous of the engineering industries in this country, &quot;but every firm was not doing too well and, in spite of the import duty in this country, there was still keen competition from foreign vehicles, and their competition in the Dominions and Overseas markets was not diminishing.    One could not fail to notice the very large number of new-Chrysler, Bulck, Chevrolet and other American makes which had been placed on the road here during the last few months, and it would be found that many of the motor coaches parked in London were Reo, Studebakers and other types which had been developed for high speed work in America, and which now found a ready sale owing to their speed being greater than the similar types of vehicles which had been built here.    If it was possible to sell them here where the duty was against. them, it was obvious that they would also be very severe competitors in our overseas markets.
SHIPBUILDING- AND MOTOR MANUFACTURE(CONTD).The six-wheeled type of vehi*le for which the War Office were now issuing a subsidy, was finding a market in some of the Dominions and Colonies and there seemed a chance of getting orders for them before, the American factories put the same type on the market.   But, as so often happened with Government speci-fications, one of the requirements of the war Office was that the studs and nuts which Were used for securing the detachable wheels, should be of a special design which differed from the standard practice both in America and on the Continent, as well as in this country.   Detachable wheels of the type now in general use were fir^b developed by Michelin, and that firm used a s-.ud and nut with what was known as a spherical seating to attach the wheel, which had a corresponding spherical seating.   The War Office were demanding what was known as a conical stud and rut. To produce both types in one factory caused a great inorease in trouble and expense, and put the British manufacturers at a disadvantage with their foreign competitors.THE PRESIDENT said that he would be glad to know what steps had been taken by the motor trade organisation concerned to go to the War Offioe and say, &quot;You have sent out a specification which is not in conformity on certain common lines with our prevailing engineering standard.   Will you modify your specifica-tion in that respect?&quot;.SIR J. THORNYCROFT said he would be able to give full details.Merchant vessols under construction in Great Qrltuin and Ireland.(Vessols of 100 tons gross &amp; upvmrds).Quarter end-ed.

9.0 1o&apos; &apos;J (COTTON.COLONEL SEDDON BRO.VN stated that, in the Egyptian side of the cotton spinning industry, the mills were still running full time, with not too profitable margins, but certainly, he thought, making a living.    One of thoir largest markets, Germany, was very much better at the moment;   their spinning power appeared to be rather greater, and their glove./ stocking and embroidery industries, which took large&apos;amounts of Lancashire yarns, were quite prosperous.   It was regrettable that, in the weaving side of the Industry In. Lancashire, looms were beginning to slacken work again, and there would be more machinery standing idle in a month from now than there wa.s to-day, unless a very marked improvement set in.As regards the section which spun American cotton, the condition there could only be de3cribed as deplorable, 7/ithout the slightest doubt the mills engaged in that portion of the industry were shipping their capital abroad as quickly as they could, with the natural result that the value of plant In Lancashire designed for that section was falling daily, and mills could be bought to-day, designed for that particular branch of the trade, at probably under  1 per spindle, whilst they could not be built under  3 or  4.    It was a most serious state of affairs.   The new yarn Association formed for that section of the trade, and embracing between 70f* and QOfr of it, had begun to operate, but so far they had had no marked effect on the marketA number of those engaged in the industry believed that they could support prices to such an extent that they would stop the rot;   but Col. Seddon Brown was afraid he was not of that view, because the competition they had to face was very largely foreign competition, and a ring which might be called a &quot;price&quot; ring at home was not, in his opinion, going to benefit them against competition from abroad.   It would appear that the whole trouble in that section of the industry was that their cost of production was too great;    it could not at the moment support the wages it was paying and the taxation and other charges put upon it of course Lancashire was very much affected by the floods in America,&apos; which had had the effect, as no doubt had been noticed, of putting up cotton about 1-hd per lb.     How much these floods really affected the cotton crops, it was very difficult to say,   An estimate from a reliable source had come out tins week, stating that it would reduce tho crop of American cotton by three million bales, and that there was a certain reduction of acreage of 13 *6%c    But probably we need not fear any suoh reduction as that in the crop.   In any event there would be no rise in prices.   The section of the Lancashire trade concerned was so dejbressed that nothing would al, the moment stimulate it. They believed that this&apos; flood was nothing but an American stunt to help the farmers.   Whether they were right or whether they were wrong remained to be seen, but it had not brought into being the slightest extra-demand.   A great number of &quot;these mills
COTTON   (CON TP.)in the American section were making arrangements with their creditors, or bringing out schemes for re-capitalisation.   There were, perhaps, twenty odd schemes at the present moment amongst the Lancashire mills, and unless someone could devise some way cf stopping the rot, it was to be feared that the coarse section of the Lancashire industry would drift to bankruptcy.   The position had never been as serious as it was today.Col, Seddon Brown desired also to mention another matter. If one looked at the imports of cotton goods into this country they seemed quite small in proportion to our large exports;   but he was sorry to say that they were increasing, and our foreign competitors were running special lines in particular trades in a way that was causing some alarm in Lancashire.   To give a concrete instance, the Dutch spinners and weavers had practically monopolised the whole of the casement trade in England,    It was quite substantial, and to-day if a woman went into s. shop to buy a casement curtain, particularly a printed, or what was called a warp printed one, it was a hundred to one that the article she would be offered would be ?;holly of Dutch manufacture.   That applied in the case of some other articles also, but In a smaller degree. - for instance, check tablecloths from Czechoslovakia. Although the figures might not at present be serious, these foreign exporters were gaining ground, and gaining it in a very scientific way, concentrating upon one article;    and,  in view of their lower cost of labour and lower taxation, etc., it was absolutely impossible for us to compete with them.   In the particular case of these casement cloths, as we had to pay British rates of wages, and 3:ritish taxes, our manufacturers were 30 per cent out, as compared with the Dutch, and therefore could not possibly compete.     Foreign manufacturers often used a fair amount of Lancashire yarn, but these particular casement curtains were generally produced from the cotton to the finished article, printed, and everything,  in Holland.   Of course Holland was quite a good market for us, but we made as a rule for Holland yarns which she could not make herself.WOOL.COLOrTHL .JILLEY considered that in the wool textile trade it might be said that the tendency in this country since last month had been slightly for the better,   Machinery employment in the comning and spinning, in the worsted trade, was pretty good. Raw material consumption was increasing, but weaving was little better and still very disappointing.   The amount of machinery standing idle was very large.    Worsted imports during March appeared,  from the Board of Trade figures, to have been about 30 per cent above those for the same month last year,  and the exports were diminishing progressively.    In woollens the position was about stationary, though some branches of the-a-
WOOL  (CONTD.)woollen trade to-day were rather better.    The hosiery trade was in a bad condition and was getting v/orse; it was probably largely a question of fashion.    The carpet trade was fairly satisfactory.    In the weaving side of the industry little disposition to ant.&apos;-crip ate requirements was shown, and mill operation was therefore very difficult because there was difficulty in working economically by planning ahead. Spinning was in a rather more favourable position because of the demand from Germany for yarn and   tops.    Such improvement as existed in tills country in the wool textile trade was largely the result of improvement in Germanyj we were already beginning to feel a distinct advantage from improved economic conditions there.    At the same time they were imcreasing their competition with us in the woven cloth.In Germany large concentrations had taken place in the silk industry,  and the same thing had occurred in the linen trades to a certain 6xtent also.     These concentrations in textile industries had contributed largely, from what one heard from bankers and economists,  to increased prosperity in Germany.    The French were also increasing their employment, though more partioulally in spinning raLher than weaving. They appeared to be getting over the shock of their currency appreciation,  although the volume of their cloth purchases was still small because their distributive machinery had not regained it.   confidence.      As to other countries, In Czecho-Slovakia business in textiles was rather better, in Poland very much better.    Dealing with the wool textile trades in Europe as a whole, it would be found that in the dress goods trade the decreased consumption of textile fabrics by women had brought about a considerable criBio. There was no doubt about that,  and indeed it was most marked in the United States, where business was very bad in the women&apos;s fabric industry.. We were perhaps just beginning to realise that the change of fashion to short skirts had produced a crisis of the first magnitude in the textile trades.MR SHAW thought that Colonel Willey had covered the position as a whole with regard to the wool textile industry. The trade in the west Riding had, in general,  undoubtedly improved, but Eradford was an exception with which h.9 would deal later.    The heavy woollen section of the trade had kept up and unemployment was diminishing, - particularly under-employment, which of course was always a very important factor.    At the end of April the unemployment recorded was 13.47 as against 14.72 at the end of March.    The lower figure referred to April 27th but even that did not fully show the improvement, because that last week of the month was worse than the previous three weeks.    Nevertheless,  the position in the heavy woollen Industry   was oausing some anxiety,  and quite recently a special committee had been set up for the purpose of making enquiries as to the extent of unemployment in the heavy woollen section.   Mr. Shaw had
WOOL  (CONTP.)already presented a report to his Executive Committee in Bradford which covered a period of five years.   During that five years, pro rata to the numbers employed in the .7est Riding, the unemployment returns in the heavy woollen industry were 100^ higher than in any other section.   That ima rather peculiar but it also applied to other districts. In the West of England where their trade was somewhat similar,  in the Stroud area there was almost four times the unemployment, covering a period of five years, that there had been in the Wellington area.    Both areas were, roughly speaking,  doing the same class of trade, and it was thought to.be well worth while to make investigations as to the contrasts in employment in the different districts. Reports from Scotland were very satisfactory, and the most doleful story was, of course, from Bradford where the only redeeming feature was the Wool Sorting section, the figure for unemployment in which would be the lowest recorded for quite a long time.    Of course this was the time for a lower figure, and the figure in the iVool Combing was also going down.    Spinning was slightly better,  and Mr. Shaw agreed thatweaving was certainly getting gradually worse. During the last six weeks it had been found that the looms, even where they were running, were running very low, and unemployment wes becoming more general.It seemed to him that the problem of the woollen trade had to be dealt ?;ith as inside our own country, apart from the question of competition from outside.   We had to consider whether it was a decaying industry, and whether there were customers for their goods if they were manufactured; and he would very much welcome a close investigation, both from the employers&apos; side and from the side of the employees. If it were possible to ascertain what were the main causes of the depression in the woollen textile industry, it was the business of those ?/ho were occupied in that industry and certainly understood it much better than anybody else, to ascertain them.   They had got to face the position that during the last three years people had left the trade, and were continuing to leave it, and looms were going out of commission.COLONS&apos;&quot;. V7ILLEY welcomed the proposal for such an investigation, as he had already stated publicly .    He was afraid, however,that some of his colleagues in the industry were less responsive to present needs than the younger members of the industry, and it was the older members of the industry who controlled it.   He would, however, pass on enthusiastically to the responsible quarters the suggestion which Mr. Shaw had made.THE PRESIDENT approved the suggestion for an investigation.    In connexion with the Census of production he had been trying to get out a comparison of output per man, in the different censal years, and it nad been found that such a comparison could
WOOL    (COIITD.)be made as between 1924 and 1907 in about 20 out of 36 trades whose 1924 returns had been examined so far.    This comparison could not be arrived at in the case of the other 15 because the Census of production of 1907 contained no comparable data. Efficiency of&apos; output per man seemed to be one of the most valuable things to extract from a Census of Production, and if a voluntary oensus of certain particulars could be established, we could then compare year by year the efficiency of output in these industries.   That provided an additional reason for the suggested investigation in the wool textile trade.ARTIFIGIAL SILK.MR. ADDISON wrote:-&quot;Trade during the month of April has shewn an improve-ment, and although this is general, the larger proportion is due to the fact that the Lancashire and Yorkshire weaving manufacturers have been able to absorb larger quantities for textures which are intended very largely for the home trade.    The export business which they are securing is on a very keen basis and practically from hand to mouth.    The hosiery trade is pursuing its normal course, that is to say, it is usual at this time of the year to note an improvenent and the last month has proved no exception.      Leek and Maoolesfield knitters are just a little better, but there is plenty of room for improvement in both areas.&quot;Export Trade.    There is no outstanding feature to note from last report.    The business we secure has to be fought for in the teeth of competition.    The markets to which this applies more strongly are South America and Scandinavia.    In the Indian market some improvement is to be noted, but for low qualities and at cut prices&quot;.CHEMICALS.MR. PERRY considered that there had been perhaps a slightly increased stability in the chemical trade during the last few weeks, but we were now forced to realise that the expected increase in demand was not forthcoming. Hanu-facturers seemed to be holding the opinion that this&quot;was due to markets lost on account of the upheaval of last year, and that it would be a very long business before those markets could be recovered.
CHEMICALS (CQNTDQAs regards the proposed new French tariff, many chemical manufacturers viewed this with great concern;  they considered that a valuable market was in jeopardy, and would urge that every possible effort should be made to secure a revision of the initial proposals.In the case of the index commodity, sulphuric acid, it appeared that 63% of the plant in the country had been in use during the first quarter of this year.    The corresponding figure for the first quarter of last year was 65fo.Mr. Perry desired to draw attention once more to the increasing importation of continental superphosphate. During the two months of January and February 1927, nearly 49,000 tons reached this country as against only 26,000 tons from the sane source in the same months of 1926.    The total consumption of superphosphate was now much less than even in pre-war days, whereas the price of it, it might be interesting to learn, had been increased so little that the increase in the average cost of carriage, railway transit alone, was more than the increase in price to the consumer, which meant, of course, that the whole of the increased cost of production had to be borne by the manufacturer.    The serious condition of the fertiliser trade, in his view, merited consideration.POTTERY.MR. H0LLINS, reverting to what Col. Seddon Brown had said about the nature of the Dutch competition in casement cloths and the Czecho-Slovakian competition in tableclothsy pointed out that questions of standardisation on the one&apos; hand, and of amalgamation or grouping of businesses on the other, to promote more efficient working, had been under consideration by the National Pottery Council.    These matters, were also being considered on the Continent, and it seemed from very authoritative reports which had been received, that they had come to a conclusion very similar to that which our employers had come to, - namely, that standardisation and grouping beyond a certain limit were not to be entertained to any large extent in the pottery industry.    The Employers&apos; Federation here had asked the operatives to give their opinion as to both these questions;    and, in principle, the operatives would agree with both the propositions, as to standardisation and as to amalgamation or groupings, as tending to increase efficiency, and also to lessen cost of production, without recourse to  -wage reductions.    The point was, however, whether these things were practicable. There were approximately 400 factories in the Potteries, mostly private companies, and about three or four publio
POT SLY (CONTD.)ones;    and this made grouping or amalgamations very difficult, for many reasons.    Something in this direction, however, was&apos; very desirable, if the position in the English bone china industry was taken as a concrete example.    The annual turnover in this section of industry amounted approximately to  1-g millions,    Tnis was the turnover of some 53 factories.    It was obvious that about 12 well adapted factories or groupings would secure that turnover more efficiently and economically than 53.    It was, however,  the personal factor which was the stumbling block to this proposition for amalgamation.With regard to standardisation, the employers felt that the buyers held the power to dictate.   While admitting this to some extent, Mr. Rollins thought that something might be done by the employers.   As a matter of fact, the tile trade-had adopted a method to facilitate standardisation by fixing a much lower price for standard tiles.    Colonel Seddon Brown had referred to the Dutch competition in casement cloths, and competition from Czecho-Slovakia in table cloths.   What apparently had happened was that these foreign manufacturers had seen, the advantages of standardisation and specialisation on these articles, and had put down machinery to produce these goods on mass production lines which enabled them, apart from any question of wages,  to be placed on the market at lower prices than our English manufacturers could meet.    There seemed to be very reliable evidence that the United States of America and Continental countries had largely adopted these methods, which gave them a distinct advantage in both our home and overseas markets.RUBBER.MR. JOHNSTON reported that the rubber manufacturing industry generally showed some sign of improvement since the last meeting of the Council.   As regards tyres, prospects had decidedly improved by the imposition of the Budget duty of 33^3/0.    Stocks of foreign tyres were large, but^the effect of the duty had been immediately felt by the cessation of unfair competition, and of prices under the cent of production, wnich had been operating for some time previously.    There were already indications of several important foreign concerns investigating the question of manufacturing in &quot;*this country, and the eventual result would,   no doubt, in one way or another bring an improvement in employment in this market.In the general rubber engineering goods trade, the tendency was more active than a month ago, although not markedly so.    The rubber footwear section was showing increasing
ax j  intensification gRUBBER (CONTD. ) .activity despite very keen foreign competition.   Employment on the whole was better., and perhaps It was not too optimistic to expect that it would continue to chow a slight Improvement.FOOD INDUSTRIES.SIR S. MACKIN reported that in the food, trade generally conditions were quiet:    vje were holding our own, but little more.    There was found to be a general demand for a rather lower grade of goods than there had been of recent years,&apos; which would look as if the purchasing power of the people was not quite what it had been.   Export trade to some countries on the Continent, as had been observed before, was practically non-existent, owing to conditions prevailing there.    It used to be fa.irn.y substantial to France and Belgium, but it no longer existed.    Germany, however,  was again coming to the. front.   VJe were having enquiries from Germany which we hoped would lead to business.    Italy also was now asking for our goods. In our own Dominions, the Indian Empire particularly,  the outlook was more promising than it had been for a long time past, business was better,  there was more confidence and it was one of the brightest spots in export trade.GENERAL TRADE.sir S. MAGHIN said that the report from the Chambers of Commerce which had been handed to him in the absence of Mr. Vyle, the President, tended to show that there was no great improvement in many of the important centres of the country.    In Hull the seed crushing trade was disappointing for the time of the-- year.   &quot;Vhilst prices of raw materials and finished products had fallen considerably, the demand was very much below average, which was probably largely due to the unsatisfactory financial position of the consumer. Extracting mills had been busier and the demand for their products for export had shown an Improvement.    The paint trade was normal for the time of the year, and all Hull works in this trade were busy and working full time.    The timber trade was steady, but the coal export business had suffered from a great dearth of orders.   From Leicester the report came that while some boot and shoe firms who specialise were busy, the general trade had not opened out to the extent which was expected in the early part of the year.      In hosiery there had not been any particular animation in the trade this week. In Liverpool the provision trades
-GENERAL TRADE (CONTD.)reported a steady, but not a greatly increasing, trade; prices remained about the same.    From Sheffield they reported that a fair number of orders had been received by steel and railway material makers, but in the tool and also in the cutlery and electro plate trades business had been quiet, especially in the home market.   On the whole the new orders received during the month- hardly compensated for those which had been executed.Co-operative Wholesale Society..MR. HAYHURST wrote:-&quot;Grocery and Provisions.    Sales continue to be satisfactory in practically every section, increases being recorded over the corresponding period of last year.    The North-Eastern side of the country, however,  is   still suffering from the effects of the general trade depression peculiar to that particular district,  though it is gratifying to know that the Grocery and Provision trade is making some headway there, week by week.    As previously stated, one must look for a general improvement in the trade of that area before business reaches its normal aspect. Butter markets in Scandinavia have not been very active during the past fortnight or so,  and whilst reduced prices have ruled, these have not been sufficiently attractive to stabilise the position,  and at the time of writing a further reduction in price is nithin the range of possibility. As usual,  there has been a steady demand for Butter produced in Denmark.    Shipments of Empire produce have just reached -uiverpool in fairly large quantities,  and it is pleasing to note that the quality is excellent.    Although the New Zealand Control Board have abandoned the policy of fixed prices,  a certain element of control is still being exercised over the distribution of supplies.&quot;Drapery, Woollens etc.      Substantial increases have been recorded in the Heavy   Drapery Section,  and the optimistic tone which prevailed amongst the various sellers some few weeks ago seems to have been justified. Throughout the period under review the demand has been gratifying. Trade in the South Wales area, which,  through the general trade depression in that district, has been looked upon as a &quot;blaok spot&quot; now seems to be recovering.    As previous decreases recorded are being very steadily reduced,   to 3ay the least this is a very interesting feature.
GENERAL TRADE (contd..)Co-operative Wholesale Society (Oontd.&apos;)&quot;Boots and Shoes.    Whilst in one or two districts small decreases in sales from a money standpoint have been recorded, other sections shew steady increases in quantities sold. Sales throughout, the country during the present year shew very good increases in quantities.     There is a very hopeful tone in this particular section of our business.&quot;Furniture, Piynishing and Hardware.      These three sections all record increases &quot;and report an improvement in practically every Department, with an outlook much better than a month ago.&quot;Production.    Works engaged in the production of foodstuffs have been well employed, similarly so in the case of boots and shoes, whilst textiles, particularly woollens, though not recording anything of an untoward character,  are still calling for increased orders.&quot;Stocks.    In no section of our business do stocks on hand at the end of April call for any particular montion, in volume being somewhat identical to the corresponding period for 1926.&quot;Tea,  Coffee and Cocoa.    The public Tea auctions in London and the East were suspended for the Easter Holidays, but the sales the previous week shewed no alteration in price, excepting for quality.    The quality of the Tea coming forward, especially from Ceylon, has been a very material factor,  as the Teas have been much below the usual standard. No public auctions of Coffee have been held for the last fortnight,  and business privately has been of small amount at previous figures.      The general tone of the market, however, is fair, especially for mild   descriptions, which are in good demand for export,    As to Cocoa-, there has been very little to report.      The Easter trade for chocolates has given an impetus to the home factories, but all the big manufacturers can shew no signs of better general trade.&quot;GENERAL TRADE AND FINANCE.MR. BRAND observed that in the United States the money situation had become still easier, owing to the import of gold. That had released the Banks still further from dependence on the Federal Reserve Bank. He did not think it likely that the Federal Reserve rate would be lowered, because they seemed to feel that there was a great    deal of danger
CONFIDENTIAL.GENERAL TRADE AND FINANCE(CONTD.)from speculation.     Money was easy, brokers&apos;  loans were rising, and although, general business activity was slightly less than last year, there seemed to be no early prospect of any period of depression, although the floods that had occurred in the South might have some adverse effect, .. to what extent it was impossible at present to say.   Prices were falling in the States, but, so far as one could see, this was due to cheaper costs of production.In Germany, on the other hand, money rates were hardening a bit and discount was a little firmer, but there was no indication of any serious rise in interest rates.   In France money was very easy.   In Amsterdam it had not been quite so easy as heretofore, but there, too, there seemed to be no sign that money rates were going to harden much.   In this country discount rates were getting down tc* a level where we should perhaps be able to get sane of the business back from the Continental centres that we had lost,  so far as acceptance business rfas concerned.    The only really interesting thing in the exchange position had been the enormous fluctuations in the lira.    Probably the great improvement in the lira was mainly due to the large amount of money that America had been pouring into Italy, but it was likely to bring with it difficulties to Italian industry.MR. CURB.I1S remarked that the reduction of the Bank rate to 4*2% had improved the market for gilt-edged securities and for stock exchange securities generally.     The discount rate appeared to have fallen rather more rapidly than was justified, and a prospective further reduction of the Bank rate to 4$ had already been anticipated in some quarters.    The percentage of loans to deposits in the Clearing Banks for the month of March had been larger than for some time, and it was not probable that the returns for April would show any considerable reduction.   From the returns made by trre Banks it appeared that Lancashire ?/as probably largely responsible for the high loan percentage..SHIPPING.MR. ALEXANDER SHAW stated that the index number of shipping freigh    was lower by about half a point since last month, but it was higher by very nearly nine points as compared with March, 1926.     The total tonnage laid up in this country on the 1st April, was 239,681 tons, and it was interesting to know that that was the lowest figure of laid-up tonnage recorded since the returns were first collected in January,1921.
SHIPPING (CONTD)*It was satisfactory also to soe a slight increase in the weight of coal exported..    That had risen by about 700,000 tons in March this year as compared with February, and by over 100,000 tons as compared with March, 1926.   With regard to tonnage commenced, in the first quarter of this year the figure of tonnage in this country commenced was 579-000 tons, as compared with 152,000 tons for the previous quarter, and with a total of tonnage commenced abroad of  71.000 tons; so that in the last quarter of last year considerably more tonnage was commenced abroad than in this country. The first quarter of this year altered that relationship entirely, because the foreigner had commenced building tonnage in the first quarter of this year to the extent of 367,000 tons as against tonnage built in Britain of 579,000 tons, so that we had not only caught up but had passed the foreigner.RAILWAY TRAFFIC.MR. HURCOMB pointed out that he would not be able to compare current figures of railway traffic with those for the corresponding period of 1926 after the end of April, because of the general strike last year.    For the first 16 weeks of this year ending on the 24th April, there had been a decline of  1,200,000 in the passenger receipts as compared with the receipts in the corresponding period in 1926, whilst on the other hand there had been an increase in the goods receipts which very nearly balanced that decline, - an increase of about  1,000,000, leaving a net reduction as compared with last year of  180,000 in round figures..    It had to be borne in mind that the receipts for the early part of 1926 had been substantially better than those for the corresponding period in 1925.   One had also to recollect that the increase in goods receipts this year was partly due to increased rates, as distinct from an increased traffic   Particulars of the actual volume of traffic &apos;?ere not at present available for any month later than February, but the figures just given afforded some rough indication of how the present position stood.Mr. Hurcomb agreed with the President&apos;s suggestions that when we got to the period this year corresponding to the period of the general strike last year, we should go back to the year earlier, 1925, for comparative figures; and also that to the figures for goods traffic in 1927 on the Board of Trade chart a note should be added indicating the date (February 1st) on which the increase (just over 6%) in the rates began.
RAILWAY TRAFFIC (COKTT. )He went on to state that the volume of passenger traffic, measured in the total number of journeys excluding season ticket holders&apos;  journeys, was roughly this:    in 1925 there had been in the month of February 86,000,000 journeys taken by railway;      in 1926, 89,000,000;    and in 1927 just over 81,000,000.    The total freight tonnage hauled in February had been 27 million tons, a decrease of 446,000 tons as compared with February last year.EMPLOYMENT.MR PHILLIPS stated that in the three weeks up to Easter the total figures of unemployment remained fairly stationary at about 1,030,000.    If, however, details of the figures were examined, it would be seen that during those weeks there had been a considerable drop in the number wholly unemployed and an almost equal increase in the number temporarily stopped.    In Easter week there had been a further reduction in the number wholly unemployed, accompanied by an exceptionally large increase in temporary stoppages, principally in the cotton trade, which had resulted in a nett increase for that week of 28,000.    In the following week there was a drop of about 67,000 in the total number temporarily stopped, and a slight increase in the number wholly unemployed, making a nett fall of 62,000.    In the result, the unemployment figure for P5th April waa roughly 1,045,000, or about 63,000 more than at the corresponding date in April 1926, whioh, of course, was just before the coal dic-pute and the general stoppage.CONDITIONS A3K0AD.COLONEL SEDD0N BROWN observed that he had been into Cotton mills all over the continent and he could never make the reported figures as to hours of work agree with the hours of work which he found being actually observed there.    He thought that was rather an important point for us to watch.    He was a member of.the Committee of the International Federation of Master Cotton Spinners which compiled a very elaborate set of figures, and he oould not even make those figures which had been produced from the   iaster Spinners&apos; returns coincide with what he saw.    It was a common thing for him to walk into mills in France and see them working 60 or 62 hours   a week. In Germany he had actually seen women working for 70 hours a week; not a mill working 70 hours, but the woman working 70 hours
CONDITIONSABROAD (qQNTD.)by drifting into a seoond shift.   He reported at the last meeting of the Advisory Council that he had seen mills running .58 hours a week in Greece, and that country, he supposed, had ratified the Convention.    There was a system of allowing them to make up for Saints days and holidays, and there were all sorts of applications they could make to their local Mayors;    and then when they had made them and got as much as they could, they ran for five or six extra hours for luck, and nobody stopped them.    There was no question but that the figures we got of the running of the textile mills on the continent were absolutely unreliable.COLONEL VvTLLEY reported that In his recent visit to Europe he had been impressed with the disadvantage we were under as regards our costs of production, as compared with European countries.    In Germany, he believed that over 57$ of the total textile trades was working more than 56 hours a week.    This information was obtained as the result of a very reliable private investigation.    Moreover, machinery In the textile industries of other countries was working not only two, but even three, shifts; and if their lower taxation was taken into consideration also, together with their lower rates and lower fixed charges as a whole, it V70uld be understood that they were producing at a cost with which we simply could not compete.    Vvhile Col. Willey was in Poland he was told that in one week 54 truck loads of cotton goods were sent from Poland into Roumania as a result of the two and three shift operations. He went into several cotton spinning mills where they were running the machinery continuously, except from 5 o&apos;clock on Sunday morning tu 10 o&apos;clook on Sunday night.    In France also, their lower cost of production was largely the result of long hours of work, but they also had advantages such as the pooling in the fashion trades, where they had a pool of hours from which employers were able to draw, to modify the statutory hours, up to a certain number, about 150 hours per annum.    Where a trade was dependent on fashion, an arrangement which permitted a warp, once put into the loom, to be run for thre-e shifts, as against having to stop for two-thirds of the 24 hours as in this country, afforded much greater resiliency and much greater adaptability to fashion.    It would be found also that In France they were being assisted by cheap money.    Ninety days&apos;  cotton bills in Havre had been discounted last week at 2-g$, according to the report of one of the leading members of the French cotton trade.There was one further point with regard to France. French competition was hitting us in Yorkshire very severely, and it was the&apos;amount of foreign labour attracted into France from Italy and from Poland which kept wages do&quot;&apos;n there and was a very material factor in their low operating cost. The French Minister of Commerce had said that there were over 2,000,000 foreign workers in France today. Col. Willey had spoken on the subject with mill employers In Poland and
CONDITIONS ABROAD (CONTD.)had seen the machinery standing idle there; they could not run it because of the migration of both workers and overlookers to France, and this was in addition to the enormous influx from Belgium into the north of France. One could realise that In the French textile trade the low operating cost was very largely the result of foreign Imported labour, which was prepared to work under conditions altogether   different from what we would impose in this country, quite apart from the native population.SIR ADAM NBtttO said he   looked at the question of hours of work in this country almost entirely from the point of view of the employment of the people.   He would like to express again the view that our Government ought to be most careful about the ratification of Hours Conventions, because we were all satisfied that we in this country ratified a Convention on an entirely different basis from that on which It was ratified by some other countries.    It meant that the cost of production in this country was constantly rising and our difficulties In securing trade, - it was the workmen&apos;s trade really more than the employer&apos;s, - went on increasing.    It seemed to Sir Adam that when a great country like the United States, where prosperity abounded, which was by all accounts a land of promise from the point of vie?/ of the workman, said it would not ratify any such Convention, and would not make an agreement in regard to hours side by side with other - -countries, that example which they set was one that ought to have our most serious consideration.V/e were satisfied, in regard to coal, that, though we might get information from abroad that certain hours were being worked in a particular coalfield, that was not the actual number of hours really worked.   Ail sorts of arrangements were made which permitted the workmen to work a much longer time.    In this country, as was right, when we made a bargain we played the game, but we were un-doubtedly, in the coal industry,  faced with conditions abroad where there was not the same serious attempt made to carry out agreements which had been entered Into.MR. BROWNLIE asked whether Sir Adam&apos;s objection to the ratification of the Washington Hours Convention was mainly based on an apprehension about our ccntinental competitors observing that Convention?     Would he have no objection to the ratification of the Convention if all countries observed it as we observed it?
SIR ADAM NIMMO said he did not know that he would give an affirmative reply to that, because he thought it was a question upon which the country should keep an entirely open situation.   The economic factors bearing upon it might shift to a considerable extent from time to time, and it might be necessary to have such elasticity in the conditions of employment in this country as v-ould enable us to secure the trade upon which our people were to live.SIR S. MACHIN viewed, with Sir Adam Nimmo, with the gravest concern any ratification of the Washington Convention. It was his duty to lead a deputation from all the Chambers of Commerce to the previous Government here, when they gave a grave warning as to the effects of any ratification of this Convention.   Their chief fears were that while we carried out our obligations, other countries did not observe theirs&apos;.   Sir S. Machin had had personal experience of this in France.   During the last year or two, as the Council doubtless knew, certain big food manufacturers had built works in or on the outskirts of Paris.   It was found that the hours of labour worked were about 10f: longer than in similar trades in this country.   They were supposed to work, say, fifty-four hours a week, but they had no difficulty whatever in getting a local permit to exceed those hours whenever occasion required.   The same applied to works in Belgium, though perhaps not quite to the same extent.MR. HOLLINS, referring to the pottery industry, said that so far as Germany was concerned, it was not possible to obtain local permits to work longer hours.   No local permit could override a statutory tariff of hours.   The operatives1 organisa-tion had something to say about this,   and the pottery tr^de in Germany had certainly got hours -vhich were very much shorter than the State tariff;    and if overtime was worked, at the end of each month it must be reviewed, and the employer must give distinct reasons why any overtime should be continued.    He could not continue overtime rates indefinitely without specially consulting the pottery workers&apos;  organisation.     In the pottery industry of Germany, hours were more controlled than they were even in our own country.AUSTRALIAN TRADE.MR. SANDERSON thought that the interest taken in the visit of the Duke and Duchess of York, and the opening of the new Parliament buildings at Canberra, had rather put aside
COMF1 DilNTIAL.AUSIhALIAN TRAPS (CONTP. )commercial interests in Australia for the moment, hut he had a few observations which it might be worth while to record.The drought conditions in some parts of Queensland and western New South Wales were still causing a great deal of anxiety, and indicated a rather serious position for the wool clip next year.     There had also been some concern about the appearance of lung worm in young sheep in districts where hitherto this had been absolutely unknown.    The Commonwealth Government had passed a further Act, in addition to the other Acts giving Boards of Control powers relating to exports. This latest Act was one applying to Fresh Fruit and to the pearl industry, and the usual procedure was being followed for getting the vote of the producers with regard to it.The Eritish Australian Tobacco Company had recently offered a large sum of money - and contributions were also expected from the Commonwealth Government and the States, -to investigate the production in Australia of its own tobacco requirements.   Attempts, not very successful, had been made to do that before, but the question was going to be tackled aga in.Investigation was now going on in Tasmania in regard to the establishment of an artificial silk industry, the promoters representing Italian interests while the capital was said to be available in England.A tyre and rubber factory was being established in Tasmania.     The delegation recently sent by the British motor manufacturing interests had arrived in Australia, and it was understood that considerable importance was being attached to their visit.SOUTH AMERICAN TRADE.MK.

The difficult situation in the nitrate of soda industry continues, and considerable time must elapse before the prospects for a definite resuscitation of the trade can accurately be gauged.   At the meeting of the Producers&apos; Association, held in Valparaiso&quot;on 7th April, free sales were authorised to commence as from the 14th of last month, with the proviso that none of the fertiliser so disposed of should leave Chile prior to 16th June,. 1927.     Definite figures of the amount sold under this new free selling system are not available, but it is reported that about 80,000 to 90,000 tons have been placed at prices ranging from 15s.9d. to 16s.
per metric quintal.     Up to the present, these quotations have failed to arouse general buying interest, but, on the other hand, they are considered unremunerative by producers.   Mean-while a Memorandum has teen presented to the Minister of Finance by the American firm of Messrs. Guggenheim Erothers, giving details of the conditions suggested by them for placing their new process for cheapening nitrate production at the disposal of the entire industry.     The process is understood to have been successfully applied at Messrs. Gugerenheim&apos;s &quot;Coya Morte&quot; oflcina.      One of its chief essentials is large scale operation, which would necessitate amalgamations among many of the smaller companies.     Messrs. Guggenheim would undertake the financial arrangements for the construction of the requisite new plant in return for holdings of preferred securities, and would be prepared to accept minority representation on the Directorates, as well as minority holdings of common stock.      In addition to granting rights for the use of their process, Messrs. Guggenheim would be prepared to supply technical advice and assistance.&quot;The Final official estimate of the current Argentine wheat crop places the yield at 6,010,000 tons, which compares with 5,202,000 tons in 1925-26.      Shipments of wheat and cereals generally from the Republic have continued on a large scale, and nearly all the old-crop maize has been exported.   The export surplus of wheat on 31st March last was estimated at 2,374,000 tons, that of linseed at 882,000 tons, and that of oats at 555,000 tons.     A heavy yield of maize is anticipated, although recent cable advices state that the harvest of late-sown mai-2.e is not expected to be above the average.     Argentine Exchange has recently been very steady at around parity, and it would appear that importers are disposed to delay the placing of fresh orders abroad in view of the possibility of further appreciation in the sterling value of the peso.    Difficulty in effecting collections from the Interior is retarding the improvement in the general commercial situation, and money is somewhat stringent, owing to the shipping of the harvest.&quot;The official returns of Brazilian foreign trade for the whole of the year 1926 show that imports amounted in value to  79,177,000 and exports to  95,972,000, these figures comparing with corresponding totals for 1925 of  84,445,000 and  102,875,000 respectively.     The favourable visible balance of trade for last year was thus  14,795,000, as against  18,452,000 in 1925.&quot;In a previous report to the Advisory Council,  I referred to the Financial Reform Decree, which was promulgated in Brazil on 18th December last, and which provided for the stabilisation of exchange on the basis of a sterling parity for the existing milreis of 5.899d.      The actual date and form of conversion of the currency have not yet been fixed, although six months notice of the operation is to be given by the Government. Pending the issue of a further Decree, however, giving such notice, the exchange of notes for gold is being carried out by the Stabilisation Office^ established for that purpose,
which commenced operations on 9th April last.   The general situation in Brazil at. the present time is the outcome of the critical agricultural and commercial conditions ruling last year, which arose from the effects of the policy of too rapid deflation adopted by the late Government.    The whole course of future events will depend upon the success attending the stabilisation of exchange, and, if this be accomplished, it is sincerely to be hoped that it will inaugurate a period of continuity of financial policy calculated to restore public confidence.   Brazil has everything to gain by encouraging the investment of foreign capital.     There is a continual and growing demand on the part of many high-class Brazilian borrowers for extensive funds, mainly required to carry out works of economic importance and of a permanent revenue-producing nature, such as highways, railways, etc., which are so very urgently necessary for the future development of the country.    Great Britain has a very special need to afford such accommodation where possible, as loan proposals of the nature indicated invariably carry with them the likelihood of the money being spent in our own manufacturing industries.    Financial arrangements of &quot;this nature will undoubtedly be facilitated by the recent reduction in the Bank Rate here, and,  indeed, there has already been floated during the past few days a loan of  1,300,000 for the State of Rio de Janeiro which was promptly and heavily over-subscribed.&quot;In Uruguay, sales are reported to have been proceeding satisfactorily in all lines in the textile, building material, and hardware markets.
