MaJes ty&apos;s Government.)COPY Mo,COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE. CHIEFS OF STAFF SUB-COMMITTEE.THE SITUATION IN CHINA,. APRIL.14,1927 POSSIBLE SANCTIONS.Interim &quot;Report by the Chiefs of. Staff.- secret i RET -(Also ColoP, Paper No.792-B).At a Meeting of the Cabinet held on A.pril 13th, the Chief of the Naval Staff made a statement in regard to the effectiveness of the sanctions we had hitherto proposed.    He recalled that at the Meeting of the House of Commons on April 4th (Cabinet 23 (27)s Conclu-      I sion 1), he, on behalf of the Committee of Chiefs of Staff, had warned the Cabinet in regard to the adverse effect on sanctions of any serious delay.    The situation had now changed considerably., and this statement xequired ^ qualification.    In view of the successes of the Northern Chinese, the period of ten days he had then mentioned could perhaps be considerably extended, but it had to be borne In mind that if the Northern forces gained possession of the plaoss where sanctions warn to have been inflicted, these particular sanctions would no longer be applicable.   Moreover, to take the proposed sanotions at the present moment against such objects as forts or arsenals which were likely in the near future
to fall into the hands of the Northern Chinesa mightmerely have the effect of antagonising the Northerners,who might be counting on utilising th^m for their own purposes.    If, on the other hand, the Southern Chinesewere to regain the ascendancy, it might be that the time within which the proposed sanctions could be appliedeffectively would be extremely limited,  in which case,either as Chief of the Naval Staff or as Senior Officerof the Committee of Chiefs of Staff, it might be his duty to warn the Cabinet of the need of an urgent decision.In any o^enfc Lord Beatty felt that if isolated action onour part wars contemplated, a different form of sanctionswas required.    They ought to be applied somewhere out ofthe line of the Northern advance,  possibly, for example,at Canton.    He thought that the circumstances were sochanged that, the whole question of sanctions ought to be entirely re-considered.The Cabinet accordingly/&apos; agreed  &quot;In regard to the ferr of sanctions:That the Commirt.ee of Chiefs of Staff should meet to re-examine the question in the light of the present situation       - -on the a-lternative hypotheses of the sanctions being undertaken by an international force or by this country alonec    The Chiefs of Staff Committee were asked to keep this subject constantly under review, as the situation changes from time to time&quot;.2. The military situation in China up to 10 a,m. on April 14th is us follows:-CIVIL WAR.(a)  The Northerners contimie to make progress on the left bank of ths Yangtse.    Pukow was occupied on the afternoon of the 12th by Shantung troopsT the Nationalists withdrawing across the riv^r to Nanking.So far no attempt seems to have been made by the Northerners to enter either Nanking or Chinkiang:
the immediate &quot;Northern&quot; plan seems to be to work westwards and to clear the left bank of the Yangtse of Nationalist troops.    Tho Military -Attache&quot;, Peking, believes the next Northern obisctive to be Anking (half-way between &quot;Tanking and Hankow) :    the National-ists are still 100 - SOC mile north of Anking, but there are signs of a Nationalist retreat back to the Yangtse.Chiang Kai-shek has gone to Nanking   possibly to rally the retirement, possibly to make some arrange-ment with the Shantung Commander.    For the first time :n the campaign, Southern formations are deserting wholesale to the &quot;North&quot;.(b)  On the Hankow - Peking railway fighting is in progress 80 miles north of Hankow, but it is unlikely that Chang Tso-lin will press on to Hankow until Anking is captured.Solit in the Natlonaljat Party.The military aspect of this dissension grows, and Chiang Kai-shek apparently feels himself strong enough to adopt an independent attitude rather than to bow to tha Hankow communist-extremists   whose power is exercised through the Labour Unions.The army seems loyal to Chiang.    At Shanghai, Chiang has raided and disarmed the mercenaries of tha local Labour Union, but has not succeeded in eliminating the Communist element.    The TVth Army   also loyal to the Commsnder-in-Chief   has occupied a strategic position on the lines of communication betwean Hankow, and Canton.   Even at Hankow many military elements are ready to support Chiang.Chiang Kai-shek is reported to have convened a &quot;moderate&quot; conference at Nanking,    &quot;he outcome of this conference should throw an important light on the stability or other\i se of the Nationalist politico-military machine. -3-
3a The bearing of the above military situation on *!the question of sanctions i3 as follows.    Ths forts andarsenals on the Yangtse, which had been designated fordestruction as a form of sanction, are likely before long to ^all into the hands of the Northern Chinese.As the latter did not destroy ther on their evacuationin retreat they may have Lad in mind the desirabilityof utilising them in the event of their return, and (as pointed out to the Cabinet by the Chief of the naval staff) would probably be antagonised by their destructionby the Powers or by ourselves.   We have considered thepossible alternative of occupying these positions with amilitary force and handing them over intact to theNortherners in the event of their arrival.    This, howeverwould involve locking up troops for a period the lengthof which cannot be measured, and we therefore decided to reject this idea.   A further objection to any actionagainst the forts is that they are at present held bythe forces of Chiang Kai-shek, who is now openly defyingthe extremist elements in the Southern Government and is un-not/likely to deal with the forces from Hunan who support the extremist party and were responsible for - -the outrages at Nanking.    Any action taken against the forts would prove detrimental to Chiang Kai-shek and tend to antagonise hims which, in the above circumstances is obviously undesirable.In present conditions,  therefore, we recommend that the destruction or occupation of the foists on the Yangtse and of the arsenal at Hankow should be abandoned as a measure of sanction, though, if circumstances change it might still prove useful.4; We have also considered the possibility, mentioned by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs at the last Cabinet Meeting, of a re-occupation of the
British Concession at Hankow.    If this operation were undertaker, it would be necessary to place a military garrison in the Concession, and this new military commit-ir-ant would be undertaken in the heart of China 600 miles up the Yangtse.    Having regard to existing commitments we do not consider this a feasible operation.5. In the circumstances, the only sanctions whichwe are able to suggest ax*e:-(i) The seizure of the Cantonese Fleet:(ii) The seizure of Custorrs revenues:the Dane Island and (iii) The destruction of/Bogue Ports at Canton.On these proposals we offer the following preliminaryobservations 06. The seizure of the fleet is undoubtedly a feasible operation which should exercise some effect on..:&apos; the Cantonese.   We f6el bound to mention, however,  that at Amoy, where disturbances were reported a short time ago, the situation is now peaceful, &quot;chiefly due to efforts of Chinese Naval Authorities&quot; (Commander-in-Chief 1s telegram No. 949 of April 7th).7. The seizure of Customs revenues can hardly be described as a &quot;military&quot; sanction, but appears to us onethe possibilities of which ought to be explored.    Inthis connection we draw attention to Sir Miles Lampson&apos;telegram No. 674, of April 11th, on the subject of sanctions, in which the following remarks occur:-&quot;As regards reparation, Consul-General&apos; s estimate may seem very large, but it is clear from reports of looting that very extensive damage has been done:    American estimate of their losses is I believe even greater,    I think it can be accepted as quite certain that Nationalists will never voluntarily produce amount of required compensation.    On this headl suggest we should at once consult His MajestyTs Consul-General at Shanghai to ascertain whether proceeds of surtaxes at Shanghai can be impounded and what steps should be
necessary.    If they can, we night consider at once pressing for this bein.7 done.   Nationalists are reported to have railway loan 5;,000,000 dollars in Chinese banks on their security but there is no reason why we should allow this money to be used -for further military operations when they have thrown off all semblance o^ anything but open hostility to us.   In this connection w-. hav^  today reports of Kiukiang Consulate being occupied and looted, and of Chinkiang Consulate also being seized&quot;.It has to be borne in mind that the impounding of the proceeds of the surtaxes would probably react immediately on General Chiang Kai-shek&apos;s position and would probablyimpair his financial resources.   We venture, however,  torecommend that the Secretary of State for Foreign A ffairsshould consult the Consul-G-eneral at Shanghai on Sir Miles .Lampson&apos;s proposal as quoted above, inviting his viewsat the same time on the bearing of the proposed actionon Chiang J&quot;ai-shek1 s position.8.      The third possible sanction is the destructionof the Dane Island and Bogue ITorts covering the mainapproaches by water to Canton.    This course was recommended by the Governor of Hong Kong in a telegram dated March 26th, ana was concurred in by the localNaval and Military authorities.    In our Report ofMarch 29th (CO. 3.  69) we rejected the proposal on grounds explained in the following extract.&quot;This operation would involve the use of military forces and the occupation of Chinese territory.    Insufficient troops for the purpose are available at Hong-Zbng, and those surplus to the garrison of that fortress form part of the Shanghai Defence tforce and ought not to be committed to any other operation. In fact, generally we are opposed at this junoturo to any action which would involve an additional commitment of unknown scope in China involving the land forces.&quot;g
The objection in regard to the ccoupation of Chinese territory no longer applies when sanctions are under consideration, but the above objection in regard to tho availability of Liiiitary forces still holdsgood. Nevertheless, in view of the fact that almost all effective sanctions in the Yangtse region aro ruled out in present circumstances, as explained in the foregoing paragraphs, we think that the possibilities of action in the neighbourhood of Canton ought to be further explored. The Chief of tho Imperial General Staff has aooordingly undertaken to instruct the Genera1-Officer-Commanding at Hong-Kong,  in conoort with the Senior Naval Officer, to report his general views as to the feasibility of the operation and the forces required in present circumstances. The Chief of the Naval Staff is, at the same fcime, suthorising the Senior Naval Officer to confer with the General-Cfficer-Commanding, and is instructing him that, if aerial reconnaissance and photographs are considered desirable, he should first ascertain from tho Acting Consul-General at Canton whether there is any political objeotion.    The Chief of the Naval Staff is also asking the Senior Naval Officer to consider whether aerial reconnaissance would militate against surprise and ought, therefore, to be reserved until attack is imminent. We recommend that the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should send a telegram to the Acting Consul-General at Canton, warning bin. that he may be approached on the subject by the Senior Naval Officer,  and (if the Secretary of State thinks fit) giving the Consul-General an expression of his own views on the politioal side of the question. Wesuggest that the Governor of T&quot;onf7-T&apos;ong should be informed.9. Before expressing any final view on the desirability of operation against the Dane Island and Bogus Forts, we consider that the subjeot requires to be explored in datail.
-8-JointWe have, acooz^dingly, instructed our/Planning Sub-Committee, on receipt of viows from the General-Officer-Commanding and Senior Naval Officer at Hong-Xong, to examine the question.     On receipt of their Report we will submit our own recommendations. 7&apos;e have not overlooked, however, that a possible objection to a strong action at Canton is the moderation displayed by the present local authorities, whom it may be undesirable to antagonise.    This point has bean brought to the attention of the Naval Commander-in-Chief in a telegram sent to him on the subject by the Admiralty.
RECOMMENDATIONS,(l) In present conditions the destructionor occupation of the forts on the Yangi/Se and of the arsenal at Hankow should he abandoned as a measure of sanction, though, if circumstances change, it might again prove useful:(2) In present conditions the re-occupation of the British Concession at Hankow, involving the maintenance of a military garrison there, is not considered a feasible operation:(3) The seizure of the Cantonese Fleet is a feasible operation which should exercise some effect on the Cantonese *   We feel bound to mention, however, that the disturbed situation at Amoy has been improved owing to the efforts of the Southern Chinese naval authorities:(4) Although the seizure sf Customs revenues is not a strictly military sanction, we venture to recommend that the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should consult the Consul-General at Shanghai in regard to the proposal contained in Sir Miles Lampson7s telegram No, 674 of April 11th in favour of impounding the proceeds of the surtaxes at Shanghai. We suggest that the Secretary of State should at the same time invite the views of the Consul-General as to the effect of such action on Chiang Kai-shek.&apos; s military position:(5) The destruction of the Dane Island and Bogus Forts covering the sea approaches to Canton is another possible form of sanction.,   We reserve our final opinion on this until we ha^e received replies to telegrams which are being sent to the General Officer Commanding and the Senior Naval Offioer-and a dtH?a-Li&amp;d*-*-reigort from our Joint Planning Sub-Committee:(6)  In connection with (5) we recommend that the Secretary 0^ State -for Foreign Affairs should send a telegram to the Acting Consul-General at Canton warning him that the Senior Naval Officer may ask whether there is any political objection to an aiir reconnaissance of the Dane Island and Bogue forts if the Senior Naval Office;- himself considers this course desirable,   &quot;&quot;e venture to suggest that the Secretary of State should consider the desirability of himself giving the Acting Consul-General some guidance on the political side of thisproposalo   We also suggest that the Governor or Hong-Kong should be&quot; informed.r,   m ,&apos; (  BEATTY.- .
