On April 14th, wa. submitted an Interim Report on the&apos;subject of possible sanctions in the coarse of which we expressed our view that in present conditions the destruction or occupation of the forts on the Yangtse and of the Arsenal at Hankow should be abandoned as a measure of sanction,  though If circumstances changed it might again prove useful. We deprecated ths re-occupation of the British Concession at Hankow involving the maintenance of a military garrison there;   we suggested that the seizure of the Cantonese fleet would exercise some pressure on the Southern Government;   we
that the seizure of customs revenues should be examined by the foreign Office;    and v/e intimated that v;e were exanining the viev; of the local naval and military authorities at Hongkong in favour of the destruction of the forts covering the sea-approaches to Canton.3.     The information received since v/e rendered the above Interim Report well Illustrates not only the rapid changes in the situation referred to by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs but also the imponderabilia of trying at this distance to prescribe sanctions where v/e have to consider the views cf so many interested parties.     Hot only have we to consider and often to consn.lt the Naval Commander-in-Chief, the British Minister at Peking,  the Governor and the Naval and Military Authorities at Hongkong and the Consuls-General at Canton and may be also elsewhere, as at Shanghai and at Hankow, but also the diplomatic and naval authorities of the Powers who were equally concerned with us in the Nanking outrages, and who have with some difficulty, been persuaded to co-operate in a demand on the nationalist Government.4.      To-day we ha^e  before us a telegram from the Naval Commander-in-Chief, dated 14th April, (Appendix I) in which he states that an informal discussion with the American, Japanese, French and Italian Senior ffaval Officers, based on the hypothetical assumption that all had been asked by their Governments for views on concerted action, had revealed (a) That the French Admiral is reluctant   to, and thinks that his Government would not consent to any stronger measures than the pacific blockade of the Yangtse;
(b) That the British, American, Japanese and Italian Senior Eaval Officers informally agreed to recommend:-(1) the destruction of the Wusung Forts. (2)    the destruction of the Yangtse Fort,3/(3)    the bombardment of the Harskow Arsenal.We have also a telegram from Sir Miles lampson, Eo. 714, dated 15th April (&quot;Appendix II) indicating that the British, French, American and Japanese Ministers at Peking (the two latter of whom declare that they were not authorised to agree to anything) considered that the first and most obvious thing to do was . -to destroy the Hankow and Canton   Arsenals which might conceivably be quite sufficient alone to achie-ra our purpose.     If that failed the destruction of the Wusung Forts and possibly the cutting off of supplies and men for the South from crossing the Yangtse ought to prove effective.7/u have also seen a telegram from Mr. Teichman at Hankow stating that the Cantonese are very uneasy about an economic blockadeby the withdrawal of shipping which vrould stop their sur-tax revenues as well as cut them off from shanghai.5.     A telegram from the Acting British Consul- -General at Canton, Ho.  7, dated 17th April, suggests that there is no use in attacking General Chiang Eai shek who is taking strong action against the Communists at Canton.     Ihs Acting Consul-General thinks that reprisals taken in another part of China from where the original trouble arises are worse than useless and that such sanctions as the shelling of military
9-4 0 &amp; J. oobjectives -and military occupation or blockade should be taken at the spot iaasediately after the outrage has occurred.     He even objects to the air reconnaissance of the Dane Island and Bogue Forts which would be greatly resented at Canton.   At the same time there is a certain amount of information to confirm the view we expressed in our Interim Report (C.O.S. - 80) that the places originally designated as sanctions are changing hands.      Thus, Sir Miles Lampson, in telegram So. 727 of April 18th, reports on the authority of the Japanese Military Attache just returned from the Front,  that Canton troops are evacuating Nanking.Rear Admiral (Yangtse) in telegram also dated 18th April, No. 540, reports that at Chinkiang the North Forts on Silver Island were flying the Northern flag yesterday but that Silver Island itself flew the Southern flag.-4-
6. In the circumstances desoribed in the two preceding paragraphs we are convinced that It is useless for us tocontinue advising the adoption of partlculsr sanctions whichhecome out of date before the;; can receive the apDroval ofthe men on the soot and tho Powers concerned.      For example,in view of the telegram from the Acting Consul General atCanton referred to above, we feel bound to drop for the moment and in present conditions the idea of destroying the DeneIsland and Bcgue Forts as a sanction;    although for reasonsunconnected with sanctions which are described later in thisReport we are continuing to study the operation.     We areimpressed by the views of the Acting Consul General at Cantonas tc ths principles on which sanctions should be taken.If, for examples a bombardment of the Ranking Forts could have been undertaken very shortly after the outrages, the desired object would probably have been achieved.     It is too late to undertake this sanction   in cold blood, and,unlessthethere is some change of system ?   ./sanctions we recommend may always prove too late before they can he put Into operation.s tr onp: ly r e c ommend 73 In the circumstances we/ the best course will beto give the Havel Commander-in-Chief (who is in close touchwith the British Minister at Peking through the Consul general at Shanghai) a free hand to take action of a retaliatoryend wherevercharacter against the Cantonese whenever/they give him the opportunity by taking the first stop.     Already the Naval Commander-in-Chief has authority to reply to fire directed against ships under his orders.     We recommend that his powers should be extended and that he should have authority, not only to reply to fire directed against any ship flying the British flag, but in such an eventuality to counter attack theoffending...
offending forces with all the power at his disposal. For example, if my ship carrying the British flag is fired at by the Wusung Forts, the Commander-iD-Chief should have authority to use all the forces at his disposal to destroy those Fortso8.        We also reooaunend that the Navel Commander-in-Chief should he authorised to draw from the Shanghai Defence Force such forces as he may require and as the General Officer Commanding cen spare for such operations as raids by landing parties to destroy Chinese forts.9.        We are convinced that it is only by giving a free hand to the men on the spot to take prompt retaliatory action with the forces at their disposal that the present situation cezj be met.      v7e recommend j therefore, that the necessary powers should he conveyed by the Admiralty and War Office respectively to the Naval Commsnder-ln-Chief and the General Officer Commanding the Shanghai Defence Force, and by the Foreign Office to the British Minister at ?ekings and at the same time, that the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should invite the Powers associated with us in the Nanking demands to give similar instructions to their respective senior naval officers and diplomatic representatives in China.     We further recommend that these orders should remain in force until satisfaction is given by the Cantonese Government for the Nanking outrageso
XO, Our attention has been called to a telegram from theGovernor of Hong Kong, dated 14th April, (Appendix 3) re*.erdiug the likelihood of trouble at Hong Kong (more especially on May 1st) fomented up by the Oomnunists at Hong Kong, in whioh event   ret Dilatory aotion against the Bogue Ports is suggested.     Although, as mentioned above, we have for tho presout dropped the Idea of destroying these forts as a sanction for the Nanking affair, we think it desirable to continue our study of the feasibility of this operation with a view to having ready a out and dried plan whioh oould be put in foroo at short notice, either as an act of retaliation for enemy aotion at Hong Kong, or in more favourable circumstances as a sanction in itself, or as an indispensable preliminary to the destruction of the Canton arsenal as a sanotion.     At present, however, the Heports at our disposal are not sufficiently detailed to enable us to say whether this is a feasible military operation with-tha. available forces.     We are calling for further Beports on the subject.     We recommend that the Senior Naval Officer should be authorised, before any attack on the forts is made and at such moment as he may deem appropriate to reconnoitre and photograph then from the air.11. Our conclusions and recommendations may be summarisedas follows:-1.     In view of the rapid ohangea in the   situation in China and of the difficulty in securing agreement by all the British and international authorities concerned in any P&amp;particular sanction, there should be a ohange of system. The attempt to prescribe snnotions from home should be abandoned, andtheAdmiralty should bo empowered to authorise the Naval Commander-in-Chief not only to reply to fire directed against His Majesty&apos;s ships, but whenever fire ie directed
991(j Cj tylagainst any ship flying the British flag to take retaliatory action against the offender with all the forces at his disposal, and if necessary to land parties for the purpose of completing the destruction of forts or guns guilty of such action.     For this purpose the Naval Commander-in-chief should he authorised to draw on the Shanghai Defence Force for any troops he may require and which the General-Officer-Commanding can spare. The Yfar Office should he empowered to give the necessary authority to the General-Officer-Commanaingo2..      The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should notify these dispositions &quot;to the British Minister at Peking, and should take such steps as he may deem appropriate to invite corresponding instructions to their respective Senior Naval Officers from the other Pavers concerned with us in the Nanking demands.3.     The above arrangement should remain in force as a means of exercising continuous pressure until the Cantonese Government have given satisfaction to the Nanking demands.4.     For the moment the proposed destruction of the Bane Island and Bogue Forts should be dropped as a measure of sanction for the outrages at Nanking, but the question should be studied and a plan should be prepared for adoption in case of enemy activity at Hong Kong; or? if circumstances should later on render this course desirable, either as a sanction or as a preliminary to the destruction of the Canton arsenal.    At present, however, we-are not in a position to advise definitely whether the operation is advisable.

I attended meeting today Thursday14th Aoril at which American Japanese French and &apos;&quot;talianS.N.0&apos;s stated that although first two had sent recomr ends tionthey had not yet been asked for their views regardingconcerted action if required to enforce compliance withultimatum ar&apos;&apos; that trey could not take part in any operation without aoproval of their respective governments.An informal discussion based on assumption that we had all been asked by our Governments for our views on concerted action revealed -(a) French Admiral is reluctant to and thinks that or(j his Government will not consent to any strongermeasures than oacific blockade of Yengtse.g&quot;ss (b) British, American, Japanese and Italian S.N.0!s&apos;^&quot;(o) informally agree to recommend -( i)    De s tr uc tion of V/usung f or ts.(ii)   Destruction of Yangtse forts.(iii)    Bombardment of Hankow arsenal.British Japanese end Italian recommend such action to becarried out simultaneously others in sentience.      No offensive action to be taken against any position actually held byNortherners whose continued advance is problematical.In case of isolated action by British being approved by H.N.Government I recommend that operations as detailed in (a) and(b) cf my 971 leaving out pieces occupied by Northerners.American Admiral would not oress suggestion re Customs Surtaxbeing seized.All S.N,0&apos;s were against sinking or seizing Chinese warships unless they interfered.2243/14.
Decy/pher .SirLamps on.(Peking) 15th April, 1927.D. 3.5 p.n.15th April, 1927.6. p.m.16th April, 1927,No-714,I explained position as set forth in your telegram No. 278 to the four I ministers on April 14thThey all took note of views of Hiis l&apos;.  .iesty sGovernment for the information of their governments.After deciding today April 15th on terms of our ioint recommendations on Ohen&apos;s note of April 14th (see my telegram No.712) discussion reverted to cuestion of sanctions.      American Finis ter and Japanese I inister took full oart whilst making it clear that they were not authorised to acrree to anything.     Undoubtedly sense of r.:meeting was (see your telegram Fo.288 since received) that first, and most obvious thing to do was to destroy Hankow , and Canton arsenals which might conceivably be quite sufficient alone to achieve cur purpose.      If that failed Wu (?3ung) for and possibly cutting off supplies and men for South from crossing Yangtse ought to or ove effective.I do not wish to r.ive away my Japanese or United States colleagues with tbeir own governments but I was frankly surorised at wholehear te c]manner in which they endorsed these suggestions.      It was finally decided that I should recommend these specific sanctions to His Usjesty&apos;s Government and suggest to them desirability of getting other governments to agree.
Should&quot;His Kaiesty&apos;s Government decide to do so I an Particularly anxious thet nothing should be said at any capital which right give my colleagues away to their governments.     Further I have their complete confidence but Japanese Minister bed a bad iolt yesterday when he had a telegram from Tokyo reporting an interview there on April lith with His I&apos;&apos;aiesty&apos;s Ambassador when he, Japanese Minister, wa apparently Quoted on a report of mine as himself strongly opposing principle of sanctions.      I have disposed of any little soreness but it shows the need for great watchfulness.Addressed to Foreign Office Ho.714, repeated to Shanghai, Commander-in-Chief, Hongkong and Tokyo
Your telegram of 12th April.     Danger we apprehend is that In revenge for proscribing Hong Kong general labour union and as a result of Kinshan incident extremists at Canton may (a) Endeavour to force another general strike in Hong Kong by means of intimidation:     40 men of the &quot;Dare to Die Corps&quot; are reoorted to have come here on 12th April and to be plotting bomb outrages.     Police hope to capture them.    (b) Renewal of Anti-British boycott by means of armed pickets at Canton and else7Jhere0This would not be case &quot;onl:/ of labour troubles in Hong Kong&quot; but a-direct communistic attack on a British Colony. Such attack would have to be ret by individual action by Great Britain.      I would add that approach of labour day 1st ?&apos;ay must be taken into account in present situation.We submit that this should not be tolerated and that if ar. attack on this Colony In either form eventuates we should at once reply by occupying Bogue Fort end. blockading the west River.     Please also see Brenanrs telegram to the Foreign Office No, 23 of 11th April.Ycu will observe from Per tor&apos;s telegram of 12th Aoril to the Foreign Office thot Chiang italy  Shek has suppressed by force rencvsl labour union at Shanghai.      Nevertheless I received to-day through Brenan orotost from Canton authorities against action taken here and GcntOn Press is full of violent propaganda on the subiect.Decypher telegram from tho Governor of Hong Kong to theSecretary of State for the Colonies,Dated 14th April0 (Received, Coloriel Office 6.50 s.m. 14th April, 1927)e
