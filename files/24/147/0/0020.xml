SECRET.A LW EOLATION  OF  THE ATTACHED  WESTERN  AND  GENERAL.                            REPORT,  No.  45.                                IMPERIAL AIXAIKS.   The telegram  of  the British Government  regarding  the  relationship of  tileDominions  to  the  inter-allied  Conference at Paris  and  the  Supreme Council  at versailles is important not only because it explains the position, but more particularlybecause the War Cabinet  clearly intimate that they would welcome  an exchange of views  with  any Minister  who may be sent over by a  Dominion Government  in  arepresentative  capacity,   ddie visits  of  Canadian Ministers to London have affordedthe War Cabinet a practical opportunity of asking the Canadian Prime Minister if hewould wish them to  be called in for purposes of consultation.   The voting of the Canadian soldiers in the United Kingdom and in Prance for theDominion General  Election commenced on 1st December, and though, the result willnot be declared, till  some time after the poll is closed, there is no doubt that theattitude of  the soldiers of the Dominion to  the conscription issue will  affect the voting of  the  Australian  soldiers, when  the  latter  commence  voting, in relation tothe same subject, ten days later.                                     CANADA..    While the Prime Minister appears to  have met, with great success  in  his election campaign in Ontario, indications  point to a strong current of public fee I big runningagainst the Union Government in Quebec Province.  Though Sir Wilfrid  Laurier has.dissociated- himself  from the Nationalist attitude towards  the war, the combination between the French-Canadian liberals and the followers of Mr. Bourassa, in. oppositionto the Union Government, will lie none the less a potent factor in the  election.   It isto  be noted  that  if the Opposition were  to secure (30  of the  (35  seats  in. QuebecProvince, it would   be necessary for them to  be  victorious  in 58 constituencies in- theother Provinces of  the  Dominion in order to  secure  a  majority  in the  House  of Commons.                                  ALLIED AFFAIRS.    Tire outstanding event of the week is the pronouncement of  President Wilson  in favour of an immediate  declaration of war by the United States upon.  Austria-Hungary. In connection with  this  it may be  noted,  that  according to Press (Renter) and  other reports, leading Austro-llungarian. statesmen have been trying  to get in touch  with Entente circles in Switzerland, with a view to starting peace overtures.  At the same time, Sir II. Rumbold has information that an American, declaration  of war is  feared in.Berlin as being likely to  precipitate a revolution in Vienna,  where there appear to have already been several determined peace demonstrations.
   The United States delegates are returning from Paris to London, where, it  is nowarranged, they will confer with the Swedisli and Dutch Missions.  The Foreign office has pointed out to Sir 0. Spring Rice that  arrangements arrived  at  in London withthe  United   States  delegates have,  on  occasion,   been  summarily  rejected  in washington.:-.         &quot;&apos;,&apos;&apos;!- 1 o&apos;     :U     &apos;     L0  l(   /&apos; s i ! / &apos; &apos;  1,! &apos;  &apos;                               OEIUIAN  AFFAIRS.   Although  the  Seventh German  War Loan fell  short, of the  sixth  by only a fewmillions sterling there, are  indications that Government paper is  viewed  with sus-piciou by peasants  ami workmen,  and that the -Bureaucracy is becoming  discreditedowing  to its  inefficiency and  the venality of its  plheials.  Herr von  Kubhuann isreported to  be greatly depressed about the political future in  Germany, as he considersthat  a revolution is inevitable after the war.                               NoRTIIKIJN NEOTIiALS.   There now appears to be a possibility thai some at least of the negotiations&apos;for theeconomic agreements with, the Northern Neutrals will take place in London, whitherAmerican, Swedish and Dutch delegates are now proceeding.  It must lie remembered,however, tbat Washington has hitherto  reserved and. exercised the right summarilyio reject arrangements made  by the United States delegates in  this country-?&apos;&apos;&apos;   ddie Royal, meeting in Chrisliamia has made  for Scandinavian solidarity, but haslicit, as far as is at present known, decided upon any attempt at  mediation between the belligerents.                                     CHINA.   The new Cabinet is not expected  to  do  much, more  than  carry on  some sort ofkd mil list ration until the  policy til conciliation lowards the South  finally ceases to be practical, when  it,  is  likely  that General Tuan  Chi-jui  may return to  power as theapostle of coercion.  Meanwhile the need for deporting ail enemy subjects from china is now generally supported by the Allies.Gtli December 1917.

PART  I.-BRITISH EMPIRE  AND  AFRICA.                             IMPERIAL  AFFAIRS.   Owing  to  an  enquiry  by  the  Canadian  Government  as  to whether  it was contemplated that the Dominions should be  represented at the inter-Allied Conference,the British  Government  have  sent  a  telegram  explaining  the  position to  all  theDominions. .  It is pointed, out that the original proposal was that the Conferenceghouhl meet  on  1,6th  October when  the principal subject to be discussed was  thequestion  of  Russian assistance  in  the  prosecution  0.1: the war,  the  object  of  theConference being to consider methods of war rather  than the terms of peace.  Thecircumstances  in  Russia  and  Italy  rendered  a postponement  of  the Conferencenecessary and many of. the subjects can now be  more  effectively considered,  by thenew Supreme Council  at Versailles  where  British interests  are  represented  by  thePrime Minister of the United Kingdom and  one  other  member of the  War Cabinet.In order  that the  British delegates may  speak with greater authority at  the meetingsof the Supreme  Council,  the War  Cabinet  would  welcome every opportunity  ofexchanging views with any  Minister whom a Dominion  Government  might send torepresent them for the purpose.   It is added  that as  the time is approaching for  thenext sessions  of  the  Imperial War Cabinet  and.  Imperial.  War Conference, the Wat-Cabinet  hope that all the  Prime Ministers  may be present in  person in order todiscuss  the  whole war  situation,   ddie  views  of  the Dominion Governments  aretherefore sought as to the  most convenient  date for these meetings to commence.   In reply to the question of date  mentioned in  the preceding paragraph,  the actingPrime Minister of Newfoundland lias referred the British Government to the PrimeMinister  (Sir hid ward Morris) who is at present  in Lngiand.   In view of the presence  in England of  the Canadian  Postmaster-General (ColonelBlondiu) and the anticipated arrival in this country of the Canadian Minister of overseas Forces (Sir Edward Kemp),  the Canadian Government are informed that theWar  Cabinet would welcome to their  meetings  a  Minister, duly authorised by theDominion Prime  Minister,   for  the  purpose  of information  and  counsel.    TheCanadian Prime Minister  is. therefore consulted as to whether, if occasion arises, hewould wish  the above Ministers to be asked  to attend the War Cabinet, and he isinvited to state his  views generally  upon the  subject.                                   CANADA.   The Prime Minister (Sir Robert Borden) at the conclusion of his Election campaign in Ontario this week, expressed his gratification at the enthusiasm and loyalty towardsthe Union  Government displayed at the meetings  throughout the  Province.  TheUnionist candidates in Quebec Province, however, have been prevented from addressingtheir  meetings  by organised gangs,  who  have frequently  threatened them,  withviolence..  Sir Robert Borden is  continuing his  campaign in the Maritime Provinces,and at the conclusion of his visit there, he will speak in Montreal&apos;on 13th December.   Referring  to  the  combination  between  the  Nationalists and. French-CanadianLiberals, the Leader of the Opposition (Sir  Wilfrid  Laurier) denied, at a meeting in.Ottawa last  week, that he  had. fallen  under the domination, of Air. Bourassa  and theQuebec Nationalists, whom he denounced.  As to enlistments in Quebec, Sir  Wilfridagreed  that the Province had. not  done her part as fully &quot;as the-English-speakingProvinces, but he placed, the responsibility for this upon the  Government, though he admitted that French  Canadians had been influenced  by Nationalist propaganda.With regard to repealing  the Military Service Act, if returned to  power, Sir  WilfridLaurier stated that lie would not repeal the law, but that his policy was &quot; to  refer it
to the people.&quot;  lie argued  that  compulsion was unnecessary- and quoted  figuresshowing an average monthly enlistment of 7,000.   Dealing with the  statement  he recently made that  the Fifth Canadian division would cease to exist  unless  reinforceiVients were sent  (ride  Report  No. 44), theMinister of Militia (Major-General Mew burn) has announced that if he can obtain menunder the Military  Service Act, he hopes  that the Fifth  Division can  be maintained.He further announces that it will be  impossible  to grant  leave  to men of the FirstContingent unless sufficient reinforcements are available.   The Minister of Militia announces that  ineu  in  Class 1.  will  be  called tip directlythe Registrars  have completed their lists in the various Provinces.   The plan  of theGovernment is  to call up do,000 men and then send oversea 10,000 each month, calling up an additional 10,000 as the drafts go abroad.   By this means, 25,000 men will be constantly under arms in the  Dominion.   Owing to the large number of exemptions from military service granted  by theQuebec tribunals, the  Military Service Council have  dismissed  20  military represen-tatives, and are arranging to  extend the time allowed for appeal to 10th December inthe cases they  have neglected.  A  statement has  been, issued calling the attention ofthe tribunals to the importance of the conscientious  performance of their  duties, asan exemption granted for insufficient reasons not only deprives the  State.of a soldier,but tends to promote bitterness and discord among the community.   Regarding  arrangements for  enforcing compulsory military  service in  relation, toBritish subjects of  Canadian &quot;birth-resident in the United  States and  citizens  of theDinted States  resident in Canada  (vide  Reports  No. 42 and. No.  44) the BritishGovernment agree  that the most  convenient course will, be  for the British ambassador at Washington to negotiate a  special arrangement  in  consultation with the dominion government.   To enable  this to be  done it will be necessary  to exclude Canadiansfrom  the Convention with the United  States  under the Military Service Conventionswith Allied Slates Act.  In describing the classes of persons  to  be excluded, it  issuggested  that  the  word  &quot; domicile &quot; should  be avoided, as likely  to give rise to trouble and  inconvenience, and  that  reference should  be made to British subjects&quot; ordinarily resident &quot; in Canada.  As to  British  subjects of Canadian birth who areordinarily resident  in some  part of the British Empire where compulsory service  isnot in force, it, is  pointed out that these persons should  lie dealt with  under theproposed Convention so that they may receive certificates of exemption.  It is there-fore proposed to insert, an article in the Convention with  the United. States  excludingBritish subjects  in the United  States  ordinarily  resident  in  Canada, and Britishsubjects in the United States who  wore  born  in Canada  unless they are  ordinarily resident in some part, of the British  Empire other  than Great Britain or Canada.   In. administering -the Military Service  Act, the  Dominion Government  have beenasked by the British authorities that skilled,  workers  in.  shipyards and allied  tradesmay 1)0 given special consideration in view  of the importance  of  securing the fulloutput of Canadian yards.   The Dominion Government point,  out  that it would be of  much help  to them ifthe British Government could give an approximate estimate of the extent to  whichorders may be  placed for shipbuilding in.  Canadian yards during the next few years,as negotiations are  proceeding with a view to establishing mills for the  roiling ofships&apos; plates and shapes.   In reply to.  the enquiry of  the Dominion Government - as to whether the contracts for the construction, of ships which  the British  Government had in the United Statescontained a stipulation  that  the ships would be  subject  to  requisition (vide  ReportNo.  4-2), the representatives  of  the Shipping Controller in the United States have reported that all contract rights  in that country are subject to requisition by Govern-nient, and a special provision was found impracticable.  The shipbuilding contracts,therefore, contain, clauses referring  to the contingency of  requisition,  but  these wereinserted in order to protect the builders and not to facilitate requisition.   Polling booths have been established in London and various parts of England toenable the Canadian soldiers to vote in the General Election.   Voting commenced on1st December and has been, very regular up  to the present time,  ddie polls will, beopen till 1.7th December.   The votes cast will be allocated to the  various constituencies and it is anticipated, that the  soldiers&apos; vote as such will not be  announced till  about six weeks after &quot;the poll.   ddie  subscriptions  to  the Victory War  Loan have  reached $375,000,000,  thuslargely exceeding the amount which the Government had stated  they desired to raise.
AUSTRALIAN  COMMONWEALTH.    The Prime Minister  (Mr.  Hughes)  has referred  to Lord  Lansd.owme&apos;s letter as &quot;most unfortunate and  calculated  to  create  the impression  that  the Empire is &quot; wavering when every man worth his  salt is  determined  that  the  hour has  come &quot; for the supremest effort to be made  for a decisive victory.&quot;   Mr. Hughes adds that tie does not believe that Lord Lansdowne represents anyone but himself.   He concludes: &quot; Let us fight  on.  Let France, America and Italy ignore such men as lord Lansdowne. &quot; They do  not represent that indomitable spirit  which lias carried our race- through &quot; in every great light for liberty.  Great Britain and  the  Dominions will fight their &quot; way through the legions of the enemy to  peace,   in no  other way can  a  lasting &quot; peace be secured.&quot;    Regarding  the arrangements  for  calling up men under  the Military  Service proposals of the Government,  Mr. Hughes  has announced  that&apos;although eligibles of 20 years will be called up, none of them will be sent  from Australia  until they have reached the  age of 21.  Me also stated that the question of giving the  vote to eligibles under 21 was now being  considered.    branches of the Returned Soldiers  Association in Victoria,  South Australia and &quot;Western Australia have passed resolutions in favour of the Governments conscription proposals and  calling upon soldiers at the front to vote in favour of the Government in the Referendum. .y* ll;  has  been  arranged  that the voting  of  Australian soldiers  in  the  United Kingdom  upon  the Conscription proposals of the Government will commence IOth- 11th  December and  continue till  20th  December when  the Referendum  voting will, close.    The Minister of Defence has stated that if the Conscription Referendum proposals of the Government are approved  by the people, one difficulty in  the way of granting leave to Australian troops at the front will be removed,  ddie Minister states  that if other difficulties are also surmounted the Commonwealth Government would do their best to obtain leave for the original members of the Australian Imperial Force.    The Minister of Repatriation has announced that under the  Government  scheme not one penny  will be  spent except with  the clear object of re-establishing soldiers in civil life.   He  said that the Government are devising a system to enable the  less seriously injured  men  to obtain  technical training in  practical workshops.   The Minister further explained that he was in consultation, wdth various Ministers of Lands in the different States,  and was hopeful that it would be possible to present to soldiers more numerous opportunities of becoming settlers.   A scheme had. been prepared, he added,  whereby the returned, soldier  could, obtain medical treatment anywhere in. his own locality at Government expense.    Owing  to  the appointment of  Senator Milieu  as  Minister  of  Repatriation, Mr.  Littleton Groom  (hitherto one of the Honorary Ministers) has been appointed Vice-President of the Federal Executive  Council.    With, regard to the request of  the British Government tdiat  the  Commonwealth should provide 1,400,0007. in gold coin  for  South Africa (vide  Reports  No. 41 and No. 44), it has  been pointed out that the need is most urgent  and  could only be satisfied by a shipment from the United Kingdom  at the expense of an  inroad  on the central resources of the Empire, which it is most important  to avoid.  As to  the  gold required, for military  purposes,  it is explained that the demand  is  now considerably increased, and  there is a serious difficulty as  regards  the transport from any other available quarter than.  Australia.   Though it was previously stated  that 400,0001&apos;. of the sum required was for military  purposes, the Commonwealth  Government  are now asked whether they could provide for this purpose 1,000,0007,.  in gold coin, in two equal consignments, in exchange  for an equivalent amount of  South African raw gold.  In reply the Commonwealth have agreed  to supply  the  1,000,000 sovereigns required for  military  purposes, and  undertake  to ship this amount  immediately a corresponding-amount  bi raw gold is  sent from South  Africa.   With regarc I  to thefurther 1,000,000  sovereigns required by the Standard Bank  of South Africa, for which raw gold  would  not be shipped, the Commonwealth  Government require futher information as to the  difficulty  in  South.  Africa, as the position in Australiahas  become difficult,  and  Ministers  believe  that  sovereigns  circulate  freely in South   Africa,   whereas  the   use  of them  is   not  permitted  to  individuals  litAustralia.   It is&apos;suggested that perhaps notes might be substituted  for gold in SouthAfrica.     -i52i)-1                             P,
   The Army  Council have  informed  the  Commonwealth Government  that  theywould like to raise  an Australian  Railway Construction Company, lor  service  inEgypt.  Although  it  might be  possible to  use some  200 Australian Light Horsereinforcements as a  nucleus,  it would  be  necessary  to replace these  men  from australia, so that the  numbers required would be up to the full  complement of theproposed Company.   ddie Commonwealth. Government  have withdrawn their offer to provide  ship-workers (vide Reports  No.  8 and. No. 19), as they now contemplate  utilising all available labour for ship-building in Australia.   in reply to the Commonwealth Governments enquiry regarding the use of enemyconsulate buildings  (vide Report No. 43), a telegram has been, sent to  the  effect  thatthe Secretary of State for  Foreign  Affairs deprecates the  use  of these-  buildings at least  until assurances  of   reciprocity  have  been  received from  the  enemyGovernments.                                NEW ZEALAND.    ddie Prime Minister of New Zealand (Mr. W. F. Massey) in addressing a Conferenceof the Associated Chambers of Commerce at Wellington, stated  that  any proposal to restore Samoa and New Guinea to Germany would lie bitterly resented by the british people in the South Pacific,   lie  declared that such an  act, would mean that Samoawould be made the headquarters of the German Pacific fleet,  and  that the enemy would establish there a wireless station, and submarine base,   ddie British Governmenthave  been told, Mr. Massey added, that &quot; we are not going to have the Germans backin the islands of those seas if we can possibly help it.&quot;    ddie Dominion Government have been informed that, owing to the heavy casualtiessuffered  by  the New Zealand. Division in the recent fighting, the Army Council aredrawing upon the 4th Infantry Brigade to supply reinforcements for the Division, andthey propose only to arrange for the maintenance of the Division in future.   assuming that no unforeseen circumstances arise, the Army Council estimate that future Infantrydrafts will be required from New Zealand at the  rate of 800 men per month, havingregard to the numbers now under training in England and the men in  the 4th infantry brigade.  It  is suggested that  the  first  draft under these arrangements  should be despatched from New Zealand at the beginning of February.  The Admiralty havesuggested the omission  of  the  months of January and March in sending reinforce-meiits, but they do not anticipate, any difficulty in arranging  ships for  other months.   With regard to the proposed  new  Admiralty Intelligence Centre at Suva  (vide report No. 43), the Dominion Government state that their Naval Adviser who performsthe duties of Senior Naval Officer in those waters proposes to keep the Naval GeneralStaff Officer at Suva  informed  in the same way as he now communicates intelligenceto the Oommanders-in-Chief at China  and the Cape;  the  Navy Office,  Melbourne;Esquiuialt, ;  and other places.   He assumes that Suva will similarly keep Wellingtoninformed.  It  is  added  that  as Apia  is  under the  control of New Zealand, the administrator there  has  reported all Naval Intelligence to  Wellington, and  it, is strongly  recommended that if a reporting officer  is  placed at Apia  he should reportto Wellington as well as to Suva, as it is essential that Wellington should have fulland early possession of  all information relating to the South Pacific owing  to theamount of traffic between New Zealand and the Pacific slope.   It is jnesunied thatthe Suva Intelligence Centre will be subsidiary to that at Wellington.   The Board of Trade have:reported by telegram to the Dominion Government thatthey expect the shipping which will be available for New Zealand  in December and January  will be sufficient materially to relieve the situation.    With  regard to  the  complaint of the Chinese Consul at  Samoa  that unrest wasbeing caused through Samoan  women being  compelled, to leave  Chinese subjectswith whom they had been Jiving (vide  Report, No. 39), the New Zealand Governmentstate that, though they have telegraphed to the Administrator of the Samoan Islands,they are  also  communicating.with him by mail  in order to secure a fuller explanation of his action.   Meantime  several reasons are given for the decision of the Administrator,amongst them being the  express desires of representatives of the Sanioan people whocomplained that the Chinese were corrupting their women.   It is pointed out thatfree Chinese subjects are not affected, and. only Samoan Islands women who have beenasked for by their parents have been returned.
                                SOUTH  AFRICA,  .    With reference to the removal  of  non-military German  subjects from  german east Africa, the Union Ministers state that, though  they are  willing to arrange forthe detention of women  and children  in South-West Africa, they  agree with  theBritish Government that there are strong objections to this.  These people could  notbe accommodated in the Union territory as the demands on hospital and convalescentaccommodation necessitate a margin being left for  the  sudden requirements of EastAfrica and Mesopotamia.   The only possible place would be in the Orange Free State ;but any camp for 1,500 women  and. children would be  designated a &quot; concentrationcamp,&quot; and. would be used by the Nationalists for political purposes.  It is suggested,therefore, that the women should be  retained in  German East Africa or sent to egypt.   It  is added  that there will be  no difficulty in interning the male civilians atPi e ters ma ri t zbi i rg.    Owing to the labour available for mines and railways being less than, that demanded by the essential requirements, the Union Ministers regret that they  cannot supply the personnel necessary to complete the 4th South African Railway Unit.    On account of the shipping difficulty and.  to avoid the disaffection  that  arose inFrance recently -when it was found  impossible to  repatriate  certain natives on.  the dates arranged, the Army Council state that thev do not wish further  natives to be recruited for  the Labour Corps except  on the conditions they have  suggested (vide report No. 41).  As to those already recruited, it is suggested, that they should be askedto serve for 12 months in France.  The Army Council do not wish to  accept  theservices of native prisoners (vide Reports No. oS and No. 44).                           GERMAN  EAST  AFRICA.    With  reference to the success of General Van Deventer  in  clearing the enemyfrom German East Africa, the War Cabinet have telegraphed that it is inadvisable  tooffer any  terms to the  German  Commander  other  than, those  of  unconditional surrender.  As  to the future  of the  country,  the Administrator  is informed,  that though the British Government, on account  of engagements with their Allies, cannot make  an authoritative statement, there would,  be no objection to making it known that  there  is reason to   believe that  German  East Africa will never be returnedto Germany.    ddie Secretary of State for War has  informed the Belgian Government that owingto the defeat of the enemy in East Africa, carried out by British and  Belgian troops, itis unnecessary to ask for further aid from the Belgian forces.   General Van Deventerlias therefore been, instructed to arrange with the Belgian Commander to release the-troops as soon as practicable.  An expression of thanks is conveyed  to  the BelgianGovernment for the way in wdiich the Belgian Commander and those under him  have -operated  wdth the  British in capturing  the  last  colony which  remained in the possession of Germany.                       PORTUGUESE  EAST  AFRICA.   In reply to the British reqxiest, the Portuguese Government have agreed to Britishtroops crossing the Portuguese  border  in pursuit of the enemy (vide Report No. 44)on  the  basis that reciprocal privileges will be accorded to Portuguese troops incrossing British borders if occasion should arise,  ddie question  of  landing troops on the Mozambique coast is  left over until the matter becomes  one for more immediate consideration.
PART  II.  -FOREIGN  AFFAIRS.                               A LI JED AFFAIRS.    The War Conference  in  Paris decided  on 1st December that the Allies would, for the  present refuse to enter into relations with the  Bolshevists, matters  affecting their respective nationals being left to be handled  by Consuls, and that no further supplies should be sent to Russia although the  machinery for handling supplies is to be  kept in. existence.    ddie Ministers  of the Balkan Allies in.  London have been  informed that their representations drawing attention to the situation  in  Macedonia would undoubtedly lie considered at the War Conference in Paris.                      &apos;    The French Government  has  undertaken to ascertain confidentially whether the SAVISS Government desires that the. Allies  should,  publicly associate themselves  with the  Culled States  in the proposed  declaration concerning the maintenance of Swiss neutrality so long as it  remains respected by the Enemy Empires and enforced  by the Swiss themselves.    Sir E. Howard learns that Germany is on the point of offering Finland 30,000 tons of wheat or more, and  urges that this  should, be forestalled,  as  if Germany offers supplies while the  Allies  refuse them, Finland will  pass under German control,  ddie Minister, in conjunction with, his American, colleague, presses for the  recognition by the  Allies  of the  independence  of Finland, which has just  been proclaimed,  by the Diet.   In this case Finland would be able to proclaim its neutrality.    Sir C. Spring Rice considers that representations can fairly be made to the United States as to the vital, importance of a concentration of the economic negotiations  with the Northern Neutrals  in. London on the ground, that  it  is only there that adequate Allied co-ordination can.  be secured adapted  to the diplomatic and  military  situation iu Europe.  Moreover, attempts  made in.  Washington,  by the War Trade  Board to co-ordinate these negotiations with the Allies, have  tended  to delay rather  than quicken the necessary,action, ;and,: on occasion  arrangements  made by United States delegates in London  have  been  summarily rejected in. Washington,  ddie American, Dutch and  Swedish Missions  are, however,  now about to meet in London.    Sir .11. Rumbold indicates that  something may be done by Interallied co-operation inside Switzerland to  increase the efficiency of the surveillance  of suspects when crossing the frontier into Italy, but  points out that Italian instructions will have to be given to secure the absolute control  over  the  movements of these people -which is so necessary in view  of the activity  of the Constantinists  in  communicating  with Greece.   Sir  R. Podd has pressed for  Allied  representations  to  be  made  to the Italian Cabinet Ministers in Paris  on the  urgent necessity  for the  enforcement  of more stringent, control over enemy  subjects in Italy.   On 4th December the Bolshevist Government published by wireless  and  in  the Pravda mi  inaccurate version of  the  secret, Treaty signed by Great, Britain, France, and.  I taly preliminary to-the entry of the last-named  Power into the war.   Lord Bertie reports that France  and the United States favour the creation  of an Interallied  Purchasing  Bureau for Spain,  in which  Great Britain  and Italy will be invited to join.   Sir  C. Spring Rice has been directed to explain  that the proposals regarding  enemy property put forward by the  Anglo-French and  Belgian Conference in Paris do  not entail confiscation,  which is  considered  contrary to the modern principles of  Inter- national Law,  but that they will bind the nations accepting them to detain  enemy property on the conclusion of peace until all Allied property in enemy  countries (e&apos;.g% works of art and other plunder taken to Germany by invading armies) shall have been released.                                     FRANCE.   Lord Bertie reports that strikes in  the  metal trade  broke  out at Firminy on 2nd December owing to the &quot; militarisation &quot;  of an  employe suspected of conducting
a pacifist propaganda, and by 4th December spread to St. Etienne and other munitioncentres.  The Ambassador learns that about 100,000 men are affected, and  that  theminers are threatening sympathetic action.  Troops have been sent and the  situationis regarded as serious.                                     ITALY.   The Foreign Office informs Sir R. Rodd that, the measures proposed by the italian authorities for the suppression of enemy activities &quot; behind  the  lines &quot; appear to be both inadequate and ineffective, and directs him to insist strongly on the adoption ofmore vigorous action.   In  a  despatch of 19th November Sir R. Rodd reports Signor Nitti, the Minister ofthe Treasury, in conversation said that he was  not  afraid of  the  return  of  SignorGiolittl to power as a Pacifist Prime Minister,   lie considered that Signer Giolitti hadbeen mistaken in his attitude towards the Avar and equally mistaken  in not, taking  theopportunity of the German invasion to  acknowledge his mistake  and  put himself rightwith the  country,  ddie Minister went on to say that           &quot; .  .  . .  The Giolittlans might intrigue, but, he did not believe they would       receive any encouragement to do so from Giolitti himself, who was conscious       of his  own false position.  Neither Giolitti nor anyone else would make peace       now.  The whole country understood  the  issue after they -were  invaded, and       were united  in spirit.  In his own constituency no less than  400 men who had       managed to evade military service had come forward  in. a body and given       themselves up to be enrolled.   The mistake made   by former administrations       was that  they had not taken the country into their  confidence and had never       made the simple people understand the real issues of the Avar.  As  to Clause 7       of the Treaty of Triple Alliance and  all the  dialectical  issues raised, in  the       Italian Green Look, they  meant  nothing to the mass of the  people.  And as       for Dalmatia, why the peasants  in the country did not even know where it was.       Ignorant, men could not tight with  their hearts  in a  cause of which they had       no knowledge or  understanding, and  no  effort had been  made to enlighten       them.&quot;                                     SERBIA.   Sir C. Spring Rice is advised that the British Government  is  unwilling to applyfood  or  tonnage to  the  relief  of occupied  Serbia  in  the absence of trustworthyguarantees reserving the native  foodstuffs to the population.  The Swiss Government,however, is being invited to protest to the Enemy Empires against the  seizure of native foodstuffs in Serbia, to wdiich alone the present distress is due.                                    GREECE.   Lord Granville reports  that the Minister of  Communications  has proposed  are organisation  of  the Syra  Postal  Censorship,  which would  have  the effect  ofestablishing  a British -Mission for  Postal. Censorship on  the same  footing  as  theBritish Naval Mission, and the Eoreign Office in reply points out that the inefficiencyof the Postal Censorship at other points in Greece is such as to hamper  the work ofthe Intelligence Service, consequently there is a great scope for a very  much, widerreorganisation than that put forward by the Hellenic Government.   In view of the absence of the permanent British, Member  of the  international financial Commission in Athens, the Minister for Eoreign  Affairs  has asked LordGranville to depute an official to represent him, as the absence of these two membersis causing inconvenience.   Lord Granville suggests that  joint action in the  matter should be taken with the French.   The Greek Government has asked that a Greek  delegate should be included  in theInterallied  Passport  Bureau at Corfu.  British, consent to this wild be given  shouldFrance agree to the proposed appointment.    4520-1                            c
f                              PORTUGAL.In a despatch of 11th. November Mr. Seeds draws attention to the fact that         &quot;The feature of the Lisbon elections was  the  appearance of a group  of    candidates known as the  &apos; List of the City,&apos; put forward  by the Monarchists    but not publicly appropriated, by them till its unexpected success in polling a    total of votes second only to that of  the Democrats, and double that of  any of    the remaining Republican or Socialist parties.  This has naturally  caused    great rejoicing in the Monarchist camp where the most extravagant hopes  are    now proclaimed,  but it would be  an  error, as stated  previously,  to take  the    resxdt  of such elections  as  indicating  any radical change  in the political    principles of the Lisbon electorate.   Credit  should, however, be  giA*en  to  the    Monarchist list for comprising candidates of an unusually respectable type, and    thus  attracting Amtes from  a class  of electors who  do not customarily take    active part in municipal politics, and it is possible  that their representatives    in  the neAv Lisbon Chamber may exercise  a  much needed steadying influence    besides  forming the nucleus of a permanent Conservative  organisation.  The    Democrats do not admit the  result of the elections  to be a defeat ;  they point    out that their party has  necessarily had to bear all  the odium of the burdens    imposed on the people by war conditions, and that,  considering the length of    time they have been  in power and  the target for every kind of criticism,  the    fact that the  pendulum has not  swung more  definitely  against  them is a    legitimate cause   for  satisfaction.   I learn  nevertheless from Democratic    sources  that Dr.  Costa  will  hand  his  resignation  to the President  of  the    Republic at an early date on the plea that his party, having carried  out their    main  task of completing  the despatch of the  Portuguese army corps to  the    French front, should now have the active co-operation of the other political    parties in sharing the burden of government.&quot;   Lord Granville is reminded to secure a definite  assurance from  the HellenicGovernment that the-Navicert system  will  be  maintained  before  addressing the collective Note respecting the appointment of  a  Greek  delegate to the InteralliedBoard  (for Shipping Control) at the Piraeus.   The anniversary of the 1st December  passed off  without manifestations, wreathsbeing deposited on behalf  of the  British and French Legations  early in the morning.Lord Granville has now been instructed, to erect a suitable memorial at the expense ofthe Admiralty.   Lord Granville  learns  that the  Minister for Foreign  Affairs believes that  KingAlexanders Court is in communication with King  Constantino by way of Her Royal.Highness Princess Beatrice and the  Court of  Spain,  and that he has asked for thischannel of communication to  be stopped.  Mr.  Morgan, British Consul in  Zurich,reports that the Greek Consul-Gen era! in that town has stated in conversation  that-            &quot;   .   .  .   .   There was no doubt  a  danger  ever present  of  the trans-       &quot;mission of letters from the  exiled  Princes to Athens thr on git the agency of the       Spanish  diplomatic bag, and this was a risk it was practically impossible  ,to       prevent.  The  entourage of  the ex-King are about to found a newspaper here,       to  be  entitled  the &apos; Ticveil National,  which  is  to appear simultaneously  in       German and Greek.  Prince George, who  had  unfortunately been allowed  to       go to Paris, has since  been in Germany, whence he has returned laden with.       4,000,000 marks for the purpose of Royalist propaganda in Switzerland.   The       journey of  Princess Alice to England has created a painful impression in this       country, and Prince Andrew is  quoted  as stating quite  openly that his wife       has  returned from England with  a promise from  King George that  there       would  be a restoration at Athens,   ddie  ex-King, ray  informant  proceeded !to       tell me, is surrounded  by a staff of six  German officers, and the ex-Queen is       especially active, being  kept informed  by frequent telephone messages of Jdie       successes  on the Italian front.&quot;    Lord. Bertie and Sir C. Spring Rice are  informed that the Treasury is prepared  toparticipate in an immediate advance of 1,500,0007. as  a free credit to be drawn uponat will by the Hellenic Government if France and the United States will share equallytherein.
                           ENEMY ALLIED AFFAIRS.    Sir (&apos;!-.  Buchanan reports that a definite statement is now being- circulated inPetrograd  to the effect that the Bolshevist operations  are  being directed by oneAustrian General and five German Staff 0Hirers, who are working on Lenihs staff inPetrograd,  and the Ambassador repeats their names.                              GERMAN&quot; AFFAIRS.    At the reopening of the Reichstag on 29th  November, Count von Hertling made his first speech as Chancellor and after drawing a rosy picture of the brilliant military position of Germany, urged the necessity for a further vote of credit.  He expressed a hope that the proposals put forward by the Russians would materialise into that peace for which they formed a  basis,  and  commented bitterly upon the imperialistic  war aims of the Allies as compared with  the modest German ambitions set&apos;forth in the reply to  the Papal Peace  Note,  ddie  allusion  to  the  possibility  of a  peace on the Eastern front is reported to  have caused considerable  satisfaction  in the  Reichstag, as did the ChauceUoFs announcement that Oourhmd, Lithuania, and Poland  would be-allowed to decide upon, the form-of their future Government.  The references to the maintenance of the Censorship were less warmly applauded.  The Reichstag adjourned on 1st December.    ddie Intelligence Bureau  estimates  the total of  the Seventh German War Loan at&apos;625,()O(),OO0Z., which, compared with the later loans is         31 ,bi)0,00()/. less than, the  Sixth  War Loan, March 1917.       90,000,000?. more than, the Fifth-War Loan. September .1916.       87,000,000?.. more than the Fourth War Loan, March 1916.       17,000,000?. more than, the Third War Loan, September 1915.    It is remarkable that the number of  small  subscribers  is very much reduced as-compared wdth those  for the other loans, and this  may be explained in part by the great difficulties  which attend any  attempt to realise small  parcels of German War Stock.  There seems, indeed, to  be a growing feeling of alarm among many Germansat the amount of War Stock held, and they are  attempting  to find alternative invest- nieiits.   Sir II. Rtimbold learns, on the authority of German delegates  to the recent Peace Conference in  Berne, that  profiteers  in Germany are particularly  anxious to avoid subscribing to  War Loans, and  that  there  is a marked  unwillingness amongpeasants and workmen to  accept Government paper money  as an adequate return forfoodstuffs or labour,  ddie former prefer to  barter foodstuffs for tobacco, clothing or matches, and the latter are now willing to work only where  special food is given in.-addition to paper wages.   These difficult economic  conditions, while produced in the first instance by the  Blockade, are intensified,  by the selfishness and egoism of the manufacturers and  the producing classes who are anxious to make as much as possible out of the war.    In view of this it is interesting to note that the new Prussian Food Controller, Herr von Waldow, on  28th November  confessed that the harvest  of breadcorn was  scanty, and that  the potato crop has decreased since last year from  539 to 309 millions of- double-centners.   The distribution of eggs has completely failed and  that of fruit is gravely  inefficient; there are,   however,  hopes  that  early  Italian vegetables  from occupied  Venetia may shortly be available  and that the sugar supply will be the sameas last year.    These announcements  can only increase  the  irritation already widely  felt at the incapacity and corruption  of the  Civil Service in Germany.   It appears  that not only have officials deliberately made  false statements about foodstuffs, aud taken, bribes to facilitate  profiteering,  but even  Herr  Scheidemann, Dr. Erzberger, and other Democratic leaders have  taken  bribes and  profited largely from war contracts, actswhich have lost  them the  confidence of Socialists serving at  the front,  ddie Foreign Office is entirely  discredited, and for this  reason even Socialists shrink, from rallying to Herr von Kuhlmann and his civilians against Marshal Hindenburg and  the ArmyHeadquarters, which is now the only body  of  men in Germany to  retain clean hands.and the  old tradition of  the incorruptibility of a rep-;,.  . dicial.  Sir W.  Townle&apos;y&apos;s-despatch of 15th November refers to this conflict of partie - :  -          &quot;  . .  . . ddie  tenacity with  which Herr Helfferich subsequently clung to       his post of Vice-Chaucellor  seemed to indicate  that, the Emperor was striving
       to lesser, his defeat at the hands of the democratic parties by keeping his own       man. in, office as a check upon a Chancellor, who had refused to accept office       without consulting the wishes of the people&apos;s delegates.  It was a further proof       of the respect now felt  in the highest  circles  in  Germany for the will  of       democracy when HelifericLs departure bad to be sanctioned and a man  of the       stamp  of von Payer put in his place.          &quot; information,  which  has readied  me from authoritative sources  would       appear to  confirm  the  belief that the Emperor  and his entourage realise and       fear the growing strength of democracy, which can but be emboldened by its       recent striking successes.   ddie  Hague  correspondent  of  the  Frankfurter       Zeitung has  quite recently  returned  from a visit to Germany, and  has come       back in a most despondent frame of mind, out of which he lias not been  raised       by the news of the German military successes in Italy.   I. understand that he       has had long conversations  with Herr von Kuhlmann, whom  he has  described       as greatly depressed about the political situation in Germain-.          &quot; One can easily believe  that this is the case, because even, before the recent       trial of strength between the Crown and  the people,  which resulted in the  total.       surrender of the former to the demands of the latter, 1.1 err von Kiililinaim had       expressed to personal friends his great anxiety about the political  future of the       German. Empire,  lie has owned to these friends that he  believes the safety of       Germany  to  depend upon, an early conclusion of peace, and claims that he has       personally talked the Emperor  over  to this -opinion, lint  he does not believe       that the present situation can lie maintained for many months.&quot;          &quot; .  . .  . Kuhlmann has  at the same time stated that  unless  peace can be      . secured  by  February or  March  at  latest, the  pan-German or &apos; guerre  a       entrance &apos; party will get the  upper hand, and force the Emperor to adopt  a       policy  which will bring  him into  direct conflict with the people,   ddie  Crown       Prince, who  is to-day in  open opposition to  his father, is at the head  of the       pan-German military party,  which  wdll, if it comes to power, probably nominate       some  military dictator as Chancellor, and proceed to a war of annexation and       spoliation, without paying the slightest heed to the  popular parties, which will       be coerced into submission if possible.          &quot;Kiihlmann. himself recognises that it is impossible to foresee what  would       come out of such, a situation, though he does not believe  that  a revolution will       break  out  so long  as  the war  lasts,  lie  is, however, convinced thai; such  a       revolution is inevitable after the war.&quot;    The remarks  of the Berliner Tagehlait for 27th November are  almost aii echo ofthese sentiments :           &quot; To-day the Pan-Germans are no longer an element of union in the German       cam]),  on the contrary they act upon it like  an explosive  charge.   Not the       furor Teutonicux possesses them but  the very fury of reaction.&quot;    ddie  Peform  Pill in Prussia, is meeting with opposition,  the  Moderate parliesconsider it inadequate while the Junkers  complain that it  is  intolerable.  There are indications that the Diet will delay the  passage of the Pull as long as possible in orderthat at least one more general election may take  place under the existing system,  as this would ensure the Government  being under Conservative control during the periodof reconstruction.  These ambitions are likely to produce serious friction in the future as  the Deputy Bernstein  is of  opinion  that Bolshevist revolution has inspired heworking man  with an open intolerance for the ruling  classes and has convinced him that they are unnecessary as a governing  factor,   idle, soldiers, -moreover, have  grownto  hate  the, bureaucrats  as  being responsible  for the  hunger and  distress of their families, at home.  The German delegates in Berne are  reported  to have predicted a collapse  of the moral, of the Germany Army in the- event of a really  serious  defeat andto have asserted that an invasion of Germany would be widely welcomed  by the troops for the increased opportunities  for desertion afforded thereby.    In.&apos;addition,  to  these signs  of  demoralisation comes  the  information   from an american source  that the mercantile classes,  as represented by Herr Ballin, now fear that the continuation of the war&apos;will lead  to  their being  economically inconveniencedin the future by the post-war measures  of the Allies.   The  public  enunciation of thisreasonable fear bv  Herr  Ballin  has  led  to  his estrangement  from  the  EmperorWilliam.                                   .       .

SWEDEN.    Sir E.  Howard reports  that  the  action of the Bolshevists  in  publishing  secrettelegrams concerning the Aaland Islands and the Stockholm Conference has given riseto a violent campaign directed  by Opposition journals  and German influence againstthe  Cabinet; in  general and Air.

&quot;imperialistic&quot; aims of  France  and at the refusal of  the Allies  to  allow Socialistdelegates to attend the  Stockholm Conference.  This  is intensified by food shortageand unemployment, and these various factors appear to be  swinging Socialist opinionround into opposition  to the Allied cause  and  hostility  to  the present Swedishadministration which  has been  unable to alleviate public  distress.   The Ministerpredicts  a return to a Conservative regime more pro-German  than the last  unlessassurances can be given that Sweden shall obtain the necessary imports within  a.measurable time,   ddie  Xing of Sweden wishes to form  the Scandinavian States intoa solid pro-German block, but cannot do  much  in  that direction while the presentMinistry is in office, and Sir E. Howard urges  that  every assistance should be givento  the  Eden  Cabinet  to weather  the rising storm by  beginning the economicnegotiations at once in order  to allow  this fact to be used to pacify public opinion.He even  thinks that the  opening of such negotiations  in &quot;Washington is better thanno negotiations at  all.    Meanwhile  Sir 0. Spring  Rice  reports that there is now a possibility that theAmerican negotiators  may return from Paris  in  order  to cooler with  the SwedishMission which is now on its way  to  London.   In  view of this Sir E. Howard reportsthe necessity for releasing certain phosphate cargoes for Sweden  in  order to save her from becoming dependent upon Germany for cereals to  supplement the crops whichwill be  inadequate  without  those  phosphates, and  suggests  that this should  bediscussed with the Mission, and that an arrangement should  be  offered to Sweden inreturn for a loan to the  Allies.    Sir E. Howard  quotes a Press report to the effect that none of the 0,000 cattlelicensed  for export to  Germany  have  left Sweden  owing  to  the inadecpiate pricesoffered by German buyers.                                   LEXMARK.    Sir C. Spring  Rice reports  that the  War  Trade  Board has presented  a draft Agreement to the Danish Minister which the Ambassador criticises as being hurriedly drawn up and  not wholly satisfactory, as the tonnage  proposals do not meet with British requirements, and the Board is apparently prepared to  concede the  liberty to continue 25 per cent, of exports to Germany,  ddie Ambassador considers that the .Danes are trying&apos; to play  off -London against Washington, and suggests  that  the negotiations  in  London be discontinued as tonnage is one of the points used  by  the Danes lor this purpose, and Sir C. Spring Rice fears that  if the Danes go back  on the tonnage provisions in their reply to the United States, it will indispose the War Trade Board to make any agreement at all.    Sir  R. Paget learns that the negotiations  with  Germany are  now concluded, and. reports that unemployment is rapidly increasing.    I n. spite of Sir R. Paget&apos;s representations that the butter, bacon, and eggs exported from Denmark to the other Scandinavian States come equally from the shares allotted to Great Britain and Germany, and that the export should be  increased in  order to reduce still further the amount left for Germany,  the Foreign Office  is unwilling to permit  the  pickled  eggs reserved for  British consumption to go  to  Norway  and sweden.                                     SPAIN.   Sir A. Hardinge, in a despatch of .1 Sth November, reports, as being probably true,the statements made to him by &quot;Seiior Hemrich to the effect that           &quot; .          the  revolt of the Reformists last June, and Don Melquiades      Alvarez&apos; repudiation of all further allegiance to the monarchy were due largely      to the anger of  the whole Extreme Left at the way in which the King  had      thrown over Count Romanones, &quot;when the latter wished to break with. Germany,      and had  allowed  the Marquis of Alhucemas to form  a Government  whose      attitude towards the Allies had been unsatisfactory.   At present, however, the      leaders of  the Extreme Left were inclined to postpone any political  agitation      against the throne until after the war.   Some of them woidd  even, lie satisfied,      after the re-establishment of European peace, with a democratic reform of the      Constitution  which would leave the monarchy  itself untouched ; but they
       wished. for  an immediate approximation  between Spain and  France.    ddie       great difficulty in the way was  the question of Tangier.  As you  know, the       extreme French  colonials, and  most Spanish  politicians, desire  to include       Tangier in their respective spheres of influence.  It had  been, suggested, that       some middle  course  between these two  alternatives  could be found by  an       agreement on.  the part of France that the Tangier-zone should be  nominally       included  in Spanish. Morocco, i.e., placed,  under the. authority of the Spanish       Khalifa, but that its actual, administration  should  be vested  in the  proposed       Committee of Control. and  Municipality of the  Tangier Statute, and that it       should  be governed  by the  provisions of  that  statute, and  of the  Dahir  on       which Spain, France,  and England had arrived at an agreement in 11)14.&quot;v   The Intelligence Bureau  considers that the Spanish, situation is now serious, and -that the King has lost popularity.   A General. Election appears to be inevitable andimminent, and will probably lead to an  increase of German influence, as the germans are  expected to  profit by the new  system of &quot; free elections,&quot; in which Governmentinfluence  is not employed as  in the  past  to  &quot;make&quot; an  election, to bribe verylavish^, and thus secure the return  of as many of their friends as possible into  the&quot;new Cortes.    Allied representations have been made to the Spanish Government on the subjectof the behaviour of  the. Spanish Charge d? Affaires in Petrograd, who is  considered to have sent a^reply of an uiineutral  nature to a communication addressed  to him  bvM. Trotzky.   ddie Foreign Office advises Sir A. Hardinge  that the Commercial Agreement nowhas more favourable prospects,  as the Spanish objects communicated by the SpanishAmbassador on his return from  Madrid,  are of a minor nature.                                THE   VATICAN.    Count, de Salis reports that the publication  of  the  supposed terms  of the London Agreement  between  Great Britain, France  and Italy, so far  as  they relate  to the diplomatic activities  of the Holy See, have  caused a very unfavourable impression in the Vatican, and that the Cardinal Secretary has  made representations on the subject. Sir P. Podd has asked for authority to show the  real text to Count de Salis in order that  the latter may be able to assure Cardinal Gasparri  of the incorrectness  of the published version if so desired.                                    JAPAN.    Sir C. Spring Rice reports that  the State Department considers that Japan is much exercised  as to  the possibility that Germany may get a controlling influence in Russia.  This would lead to an attempt to secure an  outlet through Manchuria, a menace which  Japan regards  as  serious.   Consequently  Japan  realises  that  the exclusion of Germany from Eastern Asia and  an outlet on the Pacific is a vital point of the Japanese  and American policy, and will refrain from entering into any alliance with Russia and Germany unless the  danger from the United States exceeds that from Germany.                                    CHINA.    According to a Press report the new  Cabinet,  which is of a non-party  character,. took office on 2nd December, and is composed as  follows :-       .  Prime  Minister (Acting)     -       -  WANG SJIIU-CHENG.         Minister for  Foreign Affairs-       -  Lu CMENG-IISIANG.         Minister of Finance  -                 WANG KE-TIEN.         Minister of Marine        -         -  &apos;*LTU KWANG-HSU.NO.         Minister of the Interior     -      &apos; -  TSENG NENG-KUN.         Minister of Agriculture  -         -  TIEN  WEN-LIEH.         Minister of Communications        -  &quot;:i:TsAU JU-LIN.   * Held the same office in the temporary Cabinet of Wang Ta Hsih. who  resigned on 30th Novemberafter holding office a week.
   Tliis  change  of  administration does  not, however,  imply any settlement of the differences which continue to disturb the country.  Sir J. Jordan points out that theMinister  of Communications is under Japanese influence,  and the Minister of  Marineis notoriously corrupt and  pro-German.  The  new Prime Minister is Chief of the.General Staff  under General Tuan  Chi-jui, who  appears  to  be ready to  resume thePremiership so soon as the policy of negotiation with, the South  is proved a failureand recourse is had to one of coercion.   A I.  a meeting of Allied Ministers in Peking the British proposals for the  deportation of all enemy subjects  in China to Australia for  internment was favourably received,even the  Russian Minister being prepared, to join with the other Allied/representatives in urging the  expediency of this course upon the Chinese Government.  The JapaneseMinister  bus  advised  Sir J. Jordan, that ho has  been instructed to support theseproposals,  and  the  United  States  Minister in  Peking  is  most anxious  that this&quot;deportation may lie effected  at the first opportunity, as he  fears  that  enemy  prisoners in Siberia  may  join  hands with  the Germans in China for the purpose of makingtrouble.   Although the advance of 2,000,000/.. to the Chinese Treasury on account of the currency Loan  has been postponed until  a stable Administration  be  formed, SirJ. Jordan fears that this unwelcome tra.nsacti.oii will hot die abandoned.                                  ARGENTINA&apos;!!    The  proposals  for  the purchase of the  wheat-crop  are  meeting  with, officialopposition, and are being  so  much delayed, that  Sir R. Tower considers that in viewof the. discouraging attitude  of the Argentine Government there is  little hope  forprogress unless definite and final terms are  presented jointly by Great Britain, france and  the United States for acceptance or rejection.   This proposal  is notable  in viewof the fact  that three days later isolated  action on  the  part  of  the  United. states ambassador led to no result.                                    BRAZIL.   Sir A. Peel reports  that  the  Minister  for Foreign A If airs intends to ask whether there is any further need for the enforcement of the Statutory List in Brazil now thatthe Government has passed a law prohibiting trading with the enemy.                                    MENICO.   Mr.  Cummins  reports that General Carranza has begun to enforce  certain anti-foreign clauses of  the new Constitution, expelling foreign priests  and preparing  to cancel foreign concessions granting exemption from taxation.   Sir C. Spring Rice understands that the United States Government, in spite of itsreserve in the matter  and its repeated refusals to  adumbrate its  future  policy  inMexico, is actually, building up  the  political  position, possibly of: General Villa, inorder that he may  be used as  a second  string in case  General  Carranza proves?recalcitrant.  lie learns that the State  Department considers that neither General.Diaz  nor Sen or  Iturbi.de are  likely to be  successors  to  General  Carranza,  whosedownfall, according  to all. reports, seenis  to  be assured.   In  view  of this  he  againurges  that recognition should be  withhold,  as  being likely  to  offend  the Catholicinterest in Mexico  while actually  gaining nothing.   Telegraphing on 5th  December,  Sir  C.  Spring  Rica sends  news  of a possiblePelaez-Diaz combination which may enable the former  General to seize Tampico and set up a  Provisional Government, having  for its policy the  re-establishment  of theold Constitution, and an open declaration in favour of the Allies.
                               UNITED STATES.   On 4th December President Wilson  addressed Congress  recommending that war.should  be declared  against Austria-Hungary,  lie  explained,  that  as. Turkey and bulgaria  were- only  instruments it was  unnecessary,  although perhaps illogical, to declare war against them as yet.  In  defining  the purpose of the war the president said : -          &quot; Let there be no misunderstanding&apos;.   Our  present and immediate task is to       win the war, and  nothing shall turn us aside from, it until it is accomplished.       Every&apos; power  and  resource  we possess,  whether of men,  of money,  or of       materials,  is being  devoted, and. will continue to  be  devoted, to that purpose       until it is achieved,  ddiose who  desire to  bring peace about before that       purpose is achieved, I counsel to  cany their  advice  elsewhere.   We will not       entertain it.  We shall  regard the war as won  only when the German, people       say to  us, through, properly  accredited representatives, that they  are ready to       agree to a settlement based upon justice and a reparation  of  the wrongs their       rulers have done.           &quot;They have  done a wrong to Belgium which must be  repaired.  They       have established a power  over other lands and peoples than their own over       the great  Empire of Austria-Hungary, over the hitherto  free  Balkan. States,       over Turkey, and within Asia which, must  be relinquished.           &quot; Germany&apos;s success by skill,  by industry, by knowledge, by enterprise, we       did not grudge or oppose, but admired  rather.  She had. btii.lt up for  herself       a real. Empire of  trade  and.  influence secured by the peace of the world.  We       were content to a bide, the rivalries of manufacture, science, and commerce  that       were involved, for us in her success, and. stand or fall  as we  had  or did not       have the  brains  and the initiative to  surpass her.  But at the moment when       she had conspicuously  won her triumphs of peace she threw them  away to       establish  in. their stead  what the world will no longer permit to be established,       military and political domination  by arms, by which  to oust where she could       not excel  the rivals she  most feared and hated.           &quot; The  peace we make must remedy that wrong.   It must deliver the once       fair lands and happy  peoples of Belgium  and  Northern  France  from the        Prussian  conquest  and the Prussian  menace,  but it must  also  deliver the       peoples of Austria-Hungary, the  peoples of  the  Balkans, and the peoples of       Turkey, alike in Europe and.  in Asia, from the  impudent and alien dominion       of  the  Prussian,  military and commercial autocracy.  We owe it, however, to        ourselves to say that we do  not wish in any way to impair or to rearrange the        Austro-llungarian Empire.   It is  no a If air of ours what they do with their own       life, either industrially  or politically.   We dp not  purpose or desire to  dictate        to them in any way.  We only desire to  see  that their affairs are left in their       own hands in all matters,  great  or small.    We  shall hope  to secure  for the       peoples of the Balkan Peninsula and. for the people of the Turkish Empire the       right and opportunity to make their own  lives safe, their own. fortunes secure,       against oppression or  injustice, and from  the  dictation of  foreign  Courts, or        parties.           &quot;And  our attitude  and purpose with regard to  Germany  herself are of a       like kind.  We intend  no wrong  against the  German -Empire, no interference        with  her  internal, affairs.   We  should  deem  either  the one  or the  other       absolutely unjustifiable, absolutely contrary to the principles we have professed        to live by and to hold, most  sacred throughout our life as a nation.         m.           &quot; The people  of Germany are being  told by the men whom they now  permit        to deceive them,  and to act  as their masters, that they are lighting for the very       life and  existence of their - Empire,  a war of  desperate  self-defence  against        deliberate aggression.  Nothing could  be more  grossly or wantonly false, and        we must  seek by the  utmost  openness and  candour as to  our  real aims to        convince  them of its falseness.   We are, in fact,  lighting for their  emancipation        from fear along with our own from the fear,  as well as from the fact, of unjust        attacks by neighbours,  or  rivals,  or schemers  after world empire.   No one is      .  threatening  the  existence,  or  the  independence, or the .peaeeful enterprise of        the German  Empire.&quot;          4529 J                          K
IS   In view of this possibility of a war with Austria-Hungary, which is understood tohe generally approved in Congress, it is  interesting to note that Sir II. Ruinbold hasinformation that such a declaration of: war is dreaded in  Berlin  as  being likely to precipitate a  revolution  in. Vienna.   Sir 0. Spring Rice reports that the United States  authorities have invited Britishco-operation  in  the Postal Censorship, and that the Military Service  Convention islikely to meet with little opposition.   One of the  advantages of this Agreement isthat the  compulsory recruiting  of  recalcitrant British  subjects -will in future  been forced by the  United  States Government.   Sir 0. Spring Rice  learns that in  the regulations issued, on 29th November for controlling alien enemies  in the Water Front zones the naturalization  of  Germanselsewhere  than in  the United  States  is  not  recognised  by the   Unites  StatesGovernment  as exempting them from restrictions to be enforced on alien enemies.                            SHIPPING  SITUATION.   According to the War Trade Intelligence Report, the total tonnage of 500  tonsgross in the case of steamers  and 100 tons gross in the case of  sailing ships reported lost owing to the malice of: the Ringrs enemies during the period 23rd-29th Novemberinclusive, is 109,072 tons, of which 76,440  tons  were   British,  as * compared  wdth57,085 tons, of which 49,176  were British, reported last week.   There appears to have been a certain amount of Interallied  competition  in thenegotiations for securing enemy  tonnage  interned in Spain,  as  both Italy and theUnited States  have been  trying to purchase these ships.  In the circumstances theForeign  Office has informed  Sir  C.  Spring  Rice  that the  proposals of the Italianagents will not be recognised by the  Admiralty until the negotiations of the UnitedStates Government have been terminated.   The British Government, at the request of M. Venizelos,  has agreed in future to requisition Greek ships only  with the consent of the Hellenic  Government, and  hasinvited the French and Italian Governments to adopt a similar  course  as the need fortonnage in Greece is very urgent.   The Foreign Office advises Sir C. Spring  Rice of a difference in procedure as tothe victualling of neutral ships between the United States and. Halifax,  ddie Americansgrant stores adequate for a round voyage so as to  enable a  neutral to return  to theUnited States  ;  while the British authorities at  Halifax remove all  stores above the bare requirements for a single voyage  to the neutraPs home port in  order  to prevent such surplus from being sent into Germany or sold  in excess of the ration allowance in the neutral country.                            PEACE DISCUSSIONS.   On 1st December a cessation of hostilities was arranged  between, the  Bolshevistsand the Germans and came  into  effect at 10 p.m.  next  day along a sector of someISO miles of front, from the southern bank of the Pripet to a point south of the Lipa,in Galicia.   On 3rd December negotiations for a  general armistice between  the bolshevists and representatives of the German Army and  Navy and.  of the Austrian,Hungarian, Bulgarian and  Turkish  Armies  began  at the Headquarters of  PrinceLeopold of Bavaria.   Sir Id. Rumbold learns that the German  terms of peace with the Bolshevists will include liberation of all subjects of the enemy Empires  held as prisoners of war inRussia, the retention of all Russian prisoners as  hostages, and  the  supply by russia to Germany of a quantity of foodstuffs in addition to the necessary rations  for thehostages.  The  Minister  also learns  that the Turks are negotiating for peace  withthe Bolshevists.   Sir W. dbwnley reports that the Amsterdam  market is persuaded that Rumania isabout to  negotiate a  separate  peace, while  Sir H. Rumbold learns that germany will make every effort to bring this about, even by offering an accession of territory in the Bukovina and Bessarabia.   Sir II. Rumbold learns that Germany is  upon the point of proposing a generalpeace on terms providing for the evacuation of occupied  territory by the Germans in
return for the restoration of their colonies, the re-establishment of- Belgium in returnfor the &quot; Freedom of the Seas,&quot; recognition of the- autonomy of Poland, and  theneutralization of Serbia.    ddie Russian Minister in Berne learns that the German  Minister, acting throughthe Federal Councillors Forrer and Midler, has suggested that the  Swiss Governmentshould immediately recognise  the Bolshevist Government, in order  to be in a positionto offer to act as mediator between the two groups of belligerents,   ddie Swiss ForeignMinister has, however, declined  to take the desired action.    Telegrams  from France, Italy, and Scandinavia indicate that Lord Lansdowne&apos;sletter has generally caused, an  unfortunate impression, and in many quarters it ispersistently regarded as having been  of an  official, nature, otherwise it &quot; must havebeen stopped.&apos;&apos; by the Censor.   ,    Sir R. Paget reports that Mr. Stauning, a Socialist Member of the Danish Cabinet,has written to the Dutch Socialists urging the necessity for an  International SocialistPeace Conference, but that his action is much  disapproved by the  King of denmark and the Minister for Foreign Affairs.    M. Renaudel denies the truth of Herr Schei clem ami&apos;s recent declaration in Dresdento  the  effect that a message of sympathy  and support  was  sent  by the  FrenchSocialists to the Bolshevist, Government in Petrograd.   He also denies having receivedany invitation from M. Huysmans to discuss the  advisability of summoning anew theInternational  Socialist  Conference.   The  proposed formation  of  an InteralliedSocialist Commission is, however, under consideration.                                   GENERAL.   Negotiations appear to be  proceeding simultaneously with the  Turks in Berneand at Foujes.   At the latter place Rahmi Bey has agreed to all the British demands,with the exception of the release  of the  Hadkinsons, as he  is anxious  that  AyoubSabri should owe his release to him.   Lord Newton learns from M. de Slatiii that there are  still about  800,000  Austro-Plungarian prisoners in Russia and perhaps 80,000 Germans,   ddiese are  understoodfor the most part to  be unfit, and a great number are in Sibeida, which will make their repatriation difficult,  ddie same informant estimated the numbers  of russian prisoners in Germany at about 1,100,000,  and in. Austria-Hungary at over  one million.   The Foreign Office has advised Sir R. Paget that  owing  to recent developments in Russia,  no  further food imports  are to  be allowed into Germany  for  russian prisoners who may soon cease to be prisoners.   The &quot;Dutch Minister in Berlin reports that  all British officers in Stroheu campwill shortly be sent  to Halle,  where  they will be visited by  a  Dutch,  delegate.Instructions have been sent for the camp at Vireux to be inspected,  and  an inquiry-held  into  the  reported  bad treatment.  Conditions at the camp of GRickhauf are said to be favourable.
