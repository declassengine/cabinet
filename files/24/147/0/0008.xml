SECRET.,.. ^APPRECIATION. OF  THE  ATTACHED;  WESTERN AND  GENERAL    o\r1    &apos;  -                REPORT,  No.  33.                                    FRANCE.   M.  Clemenceau&apos;s  attack upon the Government  has proved successful, and theAlmere3&apos;da-Malvy affair has produced a crisis which has made the most profoundimpression throughout  France.   Among Almereyda&apos;s papers were found documentspresumably from German sources giving suggestions for &quot; strengthening &quot; the Ententeforces at Salonica.  The inference is interesting.                                     ITALY.   The Italian section of this week&apos;s Report contains several important points.   Apartfrom the Italian jealousy of France  and the almost  incurable suspicion that we are doing more to help France  than to help Italy, there  would seem  to be very seriousanxiety regarding coal, food, and the economic position of the country.                                    SWEDEN.   The exposure of the action of the Swedish Foreign Office in facilitating the trans-mission of German code telegrams, although previously known to a limited number of people, has had a considerable effect  upon public  opinion.  The  moment  chosenin Washington for the publication of the documents of the case supports the theorythat it has been so timed as to affect the course of the Swedish  elections, and therevelations  are  undoubtedly  calculated  to  militate against the prospects  of theConservative party in Sweden.    Extreme measures, such as  might be called for  by angry Democracies against sobiassed an interpreter of neutrality, are, however, deprecated by His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment and by official circles in Washington, and it is to be remembered that when thewinter has closed down on the north, the  only route  to Russia lies  through Sweden,and the desirability of securing free transit of food supplies is to be pointed out to theUnited States.                                     BRAZIL.    The desire of the United States  to preserve harmonious relations with the south american Republics, based  on  the idea  of  Pan-American  unity   and concord,  isevidently at the back of the State Department&apos;,? reluctance to  put  pressure on Brazil,and its suggestion that Great Britain should  do whatever may be  required  in that direction.   The  Pan-American  idea has hitherto  derived much  of  its  vitality fromassociation with  the  principles  of the  Monroe  doctrine;  but  this suggestion  of theState Department would appear to recognise the necessity for important modifications of that doctrine in the near future.
                                     MEXICO.   The policy of  the United States Government in Mexico, chiefly inspired  oy;theirAmbassador  and his persistent  belief in the possibility  of  softening  the heart ofCarranza with graceful concessions, is not likely to remove the  difficulties created bythe  new Constitution.   Recognition  of  Carranza&apos;s  position,  however  ambiguouslyworded, is  calculated to encourage him  in  his predatory activities,  and, sooner or later, to precipitate the  crisis which the State Department  seeks to avoid.                                      CHINA.    As Sun Yat-sen  and others of the so-called Southern Party have hitherto beenfinanced in their revolutionary activities,  both  under the Monarchy and  the Republic,by or from Japan, it is reasonable to hope that if  their present activities are sternlydiscouraged by the Japanese Government, they may decide that the game of rebellionagainst Peking is not worth the candle ; and if, as now seems  probable, the CentralGovernment^ financial  position becomes greatly strengthened by means of an increasedCustoms tariff, remission of  indemnity payments, &amp;c, it may safely be predicted  thatSun Yat-sen, Tang Shao-yi, and other malcontents will be offered, and will accept,appointments in the public service.                                PEACE DISCUSSIONS.    Considerable interest attaches to Sir C. Spring Rice&apos;s report dated 11th Septembergiven on pa.ge 19 of the report, and also to the two succeeding paragraphs.    M. CaillauxS denial  of a visit  to  Switzerland (page 20) is remarkable in view ofthe  numerous rumours  received to the  contrary.13th September 1917.

PART  I. BRITISH  EMPIRE AND  AFRICA.                                    CANADA.    The first reading  of the  War Time  Election Act  took place in the  House  of Commons  at Ottawa  on  5th September.  In  concluding his  introductory  speech, Mr. Meighen, the  Secretary of State, declared the central  principle of the Bill  to be that war service should be the basis  of war franchise.  The vote has been given to the nearest female relative of overseas soldiers because it affords the only means of giving to soldiers, alive or dead, or prisoners, &quot; an adequate voice in the decision of  a  great electoral contest, which is  fraught with consequences peculiarly vital  to  themselves.&quot; The Bill contains drastic provisions  for disenfranchising all alien enemies naturalised within the past fifteen years (their number is estimated at 25,000),  excepting  those who have sons,  grandsons or brothers serving with the  Allied  armies at the  front. Immigrants  from European  countries, whose  mother tongue  is  that of one of  the-enemy nations, are also disenfranchised.  Assyrians and Armenians are  not included in the category of alien  enemies.   Conscientious  objectors are  disqualified for the vote.    The  Second  Reading  of the Bill was carried under  the  closure  rule on  10th September.  It  is  expected that  the final reading will take place on Saturday next and that the Bill will go to the Senate on Monday.   During the debate on the second reading Sir Wilfrid Laurier characterised the disenfranchising of aliens as a Prussian measure and a violation of the pledge of citizenship given to  them by the country. Pie also contended  that the provincial enfranchisement  of women automatically gave them the  Federal franchise,  a  statement which Sir  R.  Borden. challenged.  The Premier defended the  measure and added  that  if it had been possible to introduce a general measure of woman  suffrage it  would have been clone, but under existing conditions it was not practicable.    The Government of  Canada have been informed of  the steps taken, in pursuance of the agreement now  concluded between the British, French, and. Italian  Governments, to establish a permanent  buying organisation for  meats, fats,  and  other  foods, ex- cltiding cereals, in New York (vide last week&apos;s Report under  the heading &quot; United States &quot;.).  It is hoped that this organisation may be extended  to  Canada, whenever it becomes possible to resume Government purchases on a large  scale there.  In the meanwhile  shipments of  these foodstuffs from Canada on private  account will be allowed under licence.    The Secretary of State  for the Colonies has notified the Canadian  Government that the Wheat Commission, buying  on account of  France and Italy, as well  as for the United Kingdom, are  prepared to purchase the whole of Canada&apos;s exportable surplus, provided finance is available, but it is of the  utmost importance that the price to be fixed by the Canadian authorities should not be  higher  in  parity than the American price, viz., S2.20 the  bushel, for there would be no prospect of obtaining the necessary financial  assistance from  the United States if the Canadian price were higher than the American.  Furthermore it is extremely desirable that a loan by  Canadian Banks, now  under  negotiation, should  be completed  at once so that  purchases, urgently needed,  may be made without awaiting the conclusion of negotiations with the United States  Treasury.   Owing to the  diversion  of shipments   to  France,   Italy,  and Belgium, shipments  to the United Kingdom  must be very short and the  position dangerous ;  it is therefore  most advisable that the financial arrangements should be concluded without delay.    The  Canadian Government  have  been informed  that Lord Reacling&apos;s special mission to the United States will include financial  and other  negotiations in Canada.and that His Lordship will take an  early opportunity of visiting the Dominion.  The-Colonial  Office have  requested the Governor-General to render  him all  possible-assistance.
   The inauguration of the National Press Service has elicited warm congratulations--from Sir R.  Borden and the Premiers of the provinces.  The enterprise, which  hasbeen actively assisted by Sir R. Borden, and by a Federal grant of 10,0001., will makeCanadian newspapers in the Atlantic and Western provinces independent of Americannews agencies ; the news which the National Press Service will collect and distributeunder a  co-operative publishing system, will be made available for publication in theUnited  States through the Associated  Press.  From the  Imperial  point of view the-utility of the new service is likely to be of no small importance.                              NEWFOUNDLAND.   .   The Italian Government Commission in  London  have informed  His Majesty VGovernment  that two steamers have been  allocated to carry Newfoundland fish to-Italy.   The Government have reason to believe that the Spanish  schooners  loading fishfor Spain  at St. John&apos;s have been provided with safe-conducts by German Agenciesin Seville.   Communications between the principals  in Spain and their agents  in newfoundland are under control.   The Newfoundland Government do  not apprehendany danger of valuable information being communicated to the enemy through these-vessels, and recommend therefore that their trade should not be interfered with.                      AUSTRALIAN  COMMONWEALTH.   The Federal Treasurer has announced that the Governments liability on account ofpensions now amounts to almost 6,000,OOOZ. a year.  Of this 33,- millions consist of old age pensions ;  maternity bonuses absorb 600,O00Z. ; war pensions are just under two millions, but they are expected to  reach three  millions  before the end  of  thefinancial year.   The  Government have introduced a  Bill  for  the raising of a  war loan of80,000,OOOZ., of which 20,000,000Z. will  be  floated in Australia forthwith.  The  loanwill  be repayable in ten years and will  bear interest at 4-g- per cent., free of  incometax.   The  Commonwealth  Government have  agreed to receive foreign  coin or  goldbullion on behalf of the Government of India, and in exchange for  them  either to ship to India ready sovereigns in anticipation of the arrival of such gold in Australiawherever practicable, or to have them  converted,  into sovereigns without  delay and&apos;shipped to India.  On  the 12th of  August the Australian Government  undertook tomake a first shipment up to l,50O,00OZ.  on  receipt of advice  that bullion  had  been shipped to  Australia,  In order to avoid  any possible breach of the Currency Law,.and for accounting purposes, the Indian Government have asked to be, and have been,assured that gold for coinage  held on  their behalf  in Australia, and sovereigns in transit  from. Australia to  India,  will  he  treated as the  property  of the  Indian.Government.  It is understood that some of the gold on Indian Government accountwill be sent to Australia from Japan and the Pacific Coast of America ; the Australian.Government  point  out  that if it  is intended to  ship  it from other  countries, thequestion of sending sovereigns to India in  anticipation of its  arrival  in  Australia,.would have to be reconsidered.   His Majesty&apos;s Government have enquired whether the Commonwealth Government.would be prepared to intern in Australia enemy subjects from China, in  the event ofthe Chinese Government deciding to deport  them.   Their  number  is roughlyestimated at 3,000.   The  Minister of Railways  expects  that the Trans-Continental Railway will becompleted  early next month; there only remain 36  miles to be  laid.   A  luxuriousfast  train  service  will  be provided, and it is thought, that, as a result,  the  mailsteamer companies may decide not to run their vessels beyond Fremantle.   The Premier of Western Australia has announced the intention of the Governmentto lev3r a  tax on  wages beginning- at 2cZ.  in  the pound, and  rising to  2s.   the tax will be leviable on  bachelors receiving  over 100Z. a year  and on married  menreceiving over 150?.
NEW  ZEALAND.   The war loan of 12,000,0001. has been over-subscribed  by 4.000.000Z.   The issue is at  par, with interest at 44- per cent, free  of taxation.  The  Governor-General  has reported that the  16 millions  subscribed  is all new money,  and  that, as the onlylarge  subscription  is the 5,O00,00OZ. underwritten by the banks, there will be no need to invoke the mandatory clause of the Finance Act for the first portion of  the loan.The Minister of Finance is confident that he will find all the money he requires, up&quot;to and including the additional  issue next March, without  having recourse to  thehome market.   The Dominion  Government  have pointed out that the financial strain which mustarise, in the event  of there not being sufficient shipping space available for the exportof New  Zealand  butter, and the consequent  collapse of  this industry, will not be averted by the British. Governments undertaking to take as much  butter as can be shipped.  They therefore suggest  that His MajestyS Government should agree totake  over the entire  output, at a price to be mutually arranged ; but  if this shouldnot be feasible, they ask that the Imperial  Government should temporarily advancefunds sufficient to enable the New Zealand Government to  do so.  The amount ofsuch  advances is  not expected  to  exceed  about 1,500,000Z. at any  one time,  andarrangements would be made  for  repayment as and  when the butter is sold  in theEnglish market.   The  New Zealand Government  earnestly  hope that the ImperialGovernment will recognise the gravity of the situation arising from this problem inview  of  the steadily increasing obligations incurred by the Dominion  on account ofthe war.   In the report made to Parliament (on  a day specially set apart for the purpose) byMr. Massey  and  Sir  Joseph Ward as  delegates to the Imperial Conference, bothMinisters expressed their complete confidence  in  the readiness  of the people  andstatesmen of Great Britain to give the Dominions  a fair share in the  control  of theEmpire&apos;s foreign  policy.  As  to the means to  be  adopted  hereafter for creating an organisation representative of the Empire as  a  whole,  neither  Minister  had any definite suggestions to offer.  It is generally thought, however, that New Zealand will eventually  do as   Canada has done and appoint  a  Minister to reside in London.Acceptance of the principle of annual Imperial Conferences  practically involves  thisarrangement as far as New Zealand is concerned.                               SOUTH  AFRICA.   The question of the purchase of the wool clip by the Imperial Government is still under  consideration.    On the 10th  September, the  Governor-General telegraphedstrongly advising that before the final offer of His MajestyS Government is  submittedby the Union Government to the Conference of farmers at Bloemfontein, they should be fully informed as to the actual position of Japan in competing with the British authorities for the purchase of the wool clip.  Without further information on the subject, theUnion Government are not in a position to answer the  question raised by the farmersas to the reasons which have led His  MajestyS Government  to endeavour to preventthe sale of wool to an allied nation, and the fact  that  they cannot  answer it has lentmuch  weight to  the contention of  their political opponents, who  assert that HisMajestyS  Government are trying to drive a hard bargain at the expense of the SouthAfrican farmers.   The Union Government desire  to be clearly informed concerningthe relations between Great Britain and Japan  in  this matter  and to know whetherthe action of Japanese wool buyers in South Africa is opposed to any understanding between the two Governments ?                           BRITISH EAST AFRICA.   In view of the suspicious land-purchasing  activities of certain Swedes within theterritory of  the Protectorate, the Secretary of  State for the Colonies suggested to theOfficer Administering the Government in  July that, subject to the opinion of hisAttorney-General, it might be advisable to issue an Ordinance  prohibiting transfers    3897- -J,                             13
or grants of land to any but  British subjects during the war.   The Officer Admiuis-tering the Government, while  fully concurring in the  expediency of the proposedmeasure, reported  that legal objections might be raised,  because Article 5  of-the berlin Act of 1.885 gives  foreign  subjects the right to acquire land in  the &quot; Con-conventional Congo basin.&quot; After consultation with the  Board of Trade and the ForeignOffice, the Secretary of State  for the Colonies concurs  in the opinion that the proposedOrdinance conflicts with the provisions of the Berlin Act and other commercial treaties,and that it would  be well, therefore, if possible,  to  achieve the desired purpose by&quot;other means.  The Board of  Trade suggests that, if the prospective land buyers couldbe shown to be  suspect,  it might be possible  to  warn intending vendors  of the penalties attaching to  trading with  the&apos; enemy.  But  should this  be  consideredinsufficient as a deterrent, the Foreign Office holds  that the only alternative is  to ignore &quot;Treaty provisions, and, in the event of complaints, to defend the Ordinance onthe ground of its transient character.  The Colonial Office is, therefore, prepared to sanction the enactment  of  the  proposed Ordinance if the  Officer Administering theGovernment considers it advisable to do so.                       JAMAICA  AND  WEST INDIES.   In connection with the Indian Governments  projected  scheme of emigration, theSecretary of State for the Colonies has communicated certain  instructions  for the guidance of the Government of Jamaica and  the Governors of Trinidad and british guiana, bearing  on  the  apportionment of the expense of immigration, if and when necessary, between general revenue and the employers of labour.  The Colonial office is of opinion that the whole  cost of the introduction of workers should  continue  tobe borne by employers, but would  be prepared to  consider grants from revenue tothe Immigration Fund for settlement on land  and possibly some assistance towardsbringing out families. A subsidy to a shipping line, providing a regular service withagreed rates of passage, might also he considered.   To conform to the conditions  laiddown by the Indian  Emigration  Conference (vide Eastern  Report,  No.  32) it isnecessary to avoid any appearance of ear-marking individual immigrants to individual employers.                                   LIBERIA.   The thanks  of His Majesty&apos;s Government have  been conveyed  to the LiberianGovernment for their offer of a naval base.  In view,  however, of the facilities available at Sierra Leone, His  Majesty&apos;s Government do not  desire to avail themselves of  thatoffer ; but in order to reassure the Liberian Government concerning their safety from german attacks, they will  arrange  that British warships  shall  visit Monrovia fromtime to time.
PART  II. FOREIGN AFFAIRS.                         ALLIED  COMMON  AFFAIRS.    The question of an Allied Conference is still being thrashed out, and it is possiblethat it  may  take place in October at Paris,  and  that&apos; the United  States will berepresented.   The further despatch of  munitions and war material to Russia hy her allies is to be discussed in the light of  the Russian  proposals for  making use of thesame.   The  Italian Foreign Minister is  of the opinion that the  question  of  the revision of agreements  might  be  discussed without the Western Allies committing themselves too deeply in view of the present conditions in Russia.    The French  Government have urged the advisability of  endeavouring to obtainthe assistance of Japanese troops in Russia,  and have instructed their  Ambassador at petrograd  to  ascertain whether the  Russian  Government  would,  welcome  such assistance.  If they approve of  the proposal, it  is suggested that the British, French,and Japanese Governments  should, confer as to the best means of transporting theJapanese troops  to the Russian front.    Referring to  the proposed joint  action by the Allies to bring pressure to bear on neutral  banks to induce  them to refrain  from assisting the enemy (vide reports nos. 29 and  32) Sir M. Findlay suggests measures for circumventing the internationalfinanciers, and. advocates that the time limit for consideration accorded  to the banksshould be curtailed.    Sir C. Spring Rice  advises that  opinion  in competent quarters  in the UnitedStates realises the absolute necessity of  closer co-operation with&apos;the Allies.  Thiswould take the  form of  the appointment of representatives to take  part in AlliedConferences,  on  the  proposed Blockade Council, and  on various  economic bodies in Paris and  London.   Representations to this effect have been, strongly urged uponPresident Wilson, but  for  the moment  the President  is  influenced  by a fear ofbeing committed to war aims  which  may  prove  unpopular in  the  United States,and in  particular to  a  policy  of  trade war with Germany after  the restoration ofpeace.    Action has already been taken by the United States in placing  an embargo on theexport of goods to  Scandinavia,  and His  Majesty&apos;s Government has invited  theco-operation of the Far  Eastern Allies to prevent rice from being imported to militateagainst  the effect of the American embargo.   Furthermore, a cessation of Britishlicences in many cases has  been ordered in conformity with  the conditions of the embargo.    Lord Bertie  telegraphs that, while the French Government  is in complete accord with the policy  of Great  Britain and  the United  States on the  subject  of a generalembargo on goods for Scandinavia and Holland, no action has as yet been taken.                                   FRANCE.    M. ribot&apos;s Ministry resigned on 7th September.   The outgoing Prime MinisteFsattempt to form  a new Administration at the request of the President of  the Republicfailed, partly owing to  the  refusal of M. Pams (the  unsuccessful rival of M.  Poincarefor the Presidency) to  accept  the  Ministry of the Interior, partly to  the attacks ofM.  Clemenceau in the Press, but chiefly owing  to the defection of  the  Socialists who,while affirming  their continued willingness to co-operate with the Government in national Defence, declined to accept office under M.  Ribot.    As a result of this defection of the Socialises, M. Ribot at first endeavoured to form:a Ministry in which  they would  not  be represented,  but M.  Painleve declined toaccept office in an Administration, which did not enjoy the  support of the Socialists.M.  Ribot thereupon abandoned his efforts at reconstruction, and shortly before  noon on  10th September M. Painleve accepted  the commission  of  the President of theRepublic to form a Cabinet.    M. Painleve has announced  that if he is able to form an Administration he proposesto prosecute the war with increased vigour.  The Radical Socialist group has offered
M. Painleve its unconditional support, but owing to the abstention of the main bodyof the Socialists bis  first  attempt at forming  a Ministry, in which his former chief,M. Ribot, was to have retained the portfolio of  Foreign Affairs, came  to  nothing andthe failure was announced  in  the  Press on the morning  of  12th September.   ThePresident of the Republic has, however, requested M. Painleve to renew his efforts.    The  Socialists have published  a political  programme  under  five&apos; heads in thePress, and Lord Bertie reports  on  12th September  their decision  to  abstain fromM. Painleve&apos;s Ministry while promising him their support.    Idie affaire of &quot; Le Bonnet Rouge,&quot; after having led to the resignation of M. Malvy,has  been  rather  overshadowed by its  own  developments, but  it  is  only fair  toM. Caillaux to record  the  fact  that his contribution of 40,000 francs  to  its fundswas paid by instalments during the earlier  part of  1914, and that since the outbreakof war he has furnished no  subsidies towards the expenses of this dangerous journal.ITALY.   The visit of. the Ring of Italy to the French front has been postponed.   In a private letter to Lord Hardinge Sir Rennell Rodd  says  that  Baron  Sonninohas  expressed his confidence  in  carrying  Italy  through another  -winter of war&apos;as the successes on the Carso have greatly encouraged the  natron, although the PapalPeace proposals are generally considered to  have been  launched, at  the moment  of  animportant offensive with the intention of weakening its martial spirit.  In spite of theForeign MinisteFs confidence there are  difficulties enumerated by  the Ambassador, theremoval of which would greatly ease public opinion which is.at present irritated by asuspicion that France enjoys a preferential treatment at the hands of Great Britainover that accorded to Italy in these matters.   The  points cited, by the Ambassador arethe coal supply, and the trade restrictions imposed  by the exigencies of the blockadeon the export  of citrous fruits from Southern Italy.   Sir R. Rodd telegraphs that the Italian Minister of Agriculture received his news of the inability of Great Britain to co-operate in the disposal of  the orange crop wdthconsternation  and.  expressed his  opinion  that a  failure  to  export oranges would produce a  revolution in Sicily.  The  lemon scheme  (which is  considered as moreimportant by the Foreign Office in its relation to the blockade) was of less interest as affecting a  smaller  area.   The Ambassador  is anxious that the  question should beconsidered,  not  only  from the point of view of the  blockade,  but as affecting theinternal tranquillity of  the south and  the maintenance of  pro-Ally sentiment amongthe Italian public.  He points out further that,  in view of the nature  of the situationin the south, Germany is quite likely to veto the alternative scheme of reopening theGerman market  to Italian  oranges, with the intention  of  provoking a revolutionary movement in Sicily.   &quot;With reference to the revolutionary tendencies  mentioned  above,  the Minister forForeign Affairs, in conversation with the Ambassador, wras understood to express hisdissatisfaction with  the action of the Minister of  the  Interior for having allowed toofree a hand to pacifists and agitators, and to  advocate a  change of policy in that direction, or of persons.    The Ambassador, with reference to  the balance  of  trade between  Italy and GreatBritain,  further pointed out  that  certain  import prohibitions hitherto  invariablywaived in favour of British goods will  now probably  be enforced with a view to theimprovement  of  the  present  depressed state of exchange on London.  The ItalianGovernment also urge that as the grain cargoes allotted to Italy for September by theWheat  Executive in London are quite inadequate they cannot  consent to make over any of their vessels to Greece.    In reply to the representations  made  on behalf of M.  Pashitch&apos;s proposals that southern Slav prisoners of war held by Italy  should be released in order to join theSerbian Army in Macedonia, the Italian Foreign Office points  out that such action, ifofficially taken, might expose the numerous Italian prisoners in Austria to reprisals as wellas the Southern Slavs themselves, who would undoubtedly be shot under international lawif captured by the Austrians when fighting as Serbian soldiers. While prepared to permitCzech prisoners to enjoy preferential treatment and  undergo a form  of training incaptivity, he was unable to allow them  to go to France to join Bohemian units in thatcountry.  A few southern Slavs, howrever, have been quietly  allowed to leave Italyand join the Serbians.
                                   BELGIUM.   The amount of the advances made to Belgium by France  and Great Britain  up to24th August is announced by the  French Minister of Finance to exceed three milliardsof francs (3,010,636,000 frs.),  of which  France had  contributed a  slightly  greatershare  (1,519,636,000 frs.) than  Great  Britain (1,491,000,000 frs.).   The new loanwill run as from 25th August.   The &quot; Deutsche Tageszeitung &quot; of 8th September, in a leading article, asserts thatthe only way to save Belgium from being made the battle-ground of Europe is by takingher under German protection.   The King and the former Government of Belgium, as having been the agents  of the oppression exercised by the Entente  upon Belgium,must be ejected as there will be no room for these symbols of the Entente in Flandersor Wallonia after the war.                                   GREECE.   With regard to the various proposals made in connection with the transfer of mento the Allied  front in Macedonia, Lord  Bertie  telegraphs the observations of theFrench Government on the shortage of men at General Sarraihs  disposal and  their request that Great Britain should urge  Italy to arrange for that extension of theItalian front in Macedonia for which General  Sarrail has  several  times  asked invain.   The Hellenic Government are anxious to escape from the  control over the issue ofpassports exercised by France and Great Britain within their respective  naval zoneson the ground that such control is derogatory from the national dignity  and that its continuance is likely to undermine the prestige and  influence of  M. Venizelos.  Atthe same time the British Charge d&apos;Affaires in Athens  puts forward a suggestion thata Greek representative should be attached to the Allied Board which sits at the Pirasusto control the  importation of  foodstuffs  and  the allocation  of  tonnage.   lie alsopoints out that the dearth of coal in Greece is causing much anxiety.  Special a range-ments have had to be made for feeding the homeless population of Salonika.   The-Foreign Office emphasises the necessity for the retention  of  an efficientcensorship at Syra, and informs  Mr.  Crackanthorpe  that as  a purely Greek control would be dangerous, British co-operation  in such matters is to  be suggested to theGreek Government, remembering  that  the substance of the  control,  as distinct fromthe form, must remain in British hands.   While  on  the  one  hand  Greece  is  resuming  her international relationshipsinterrupted by the events of  December  last,   in. that the piarcels post and moneyorder  service wdth the  United Kingdom  have  been  re-established, on  the  otherinternal  conditions have necessitated  the -proclamation of martial law in  the northand north-west of the Peloponnese.   Arrangements for  the withdrawal  of Italian  troops from  Epirus  appear to beproceeding smoothly.   His Britannic  Majesty&apos;s Consul at Janina  reports that whileMetzovo  was to be evacuated  on  10th September, Janina, where all  is quiet, willprobably not be occupied by the Greeks for a few days to come.   Reports are current  that King Constantino is anxious to open amicable relationswith  the British Legation in Berne as indicative of  his opinion  that his depositionwas  the  act of France,  and  that he  has no  animus against  Great  Britain.  Sir II.Rum bold has been instructed to evade the Royal overtures.                                   ALBANIA.   The Hellenic Government  suggest  that the Albanian assertions as to the seizure of Moslem  property in Southern Albania (vide Report No. 32) are based upon action taken with  regard  to property of Moslems who have opted for Ottoman  nationalityunder  the  provisions of the  Treaty  of Athens.  This action is in  accordance withlaw so far as Greek Epirus is  concerned, but it  is open to doubt  as  to  its legality aswell as its  advisability should it have been taken anywhere within the  area  allottedby the Conference of Ambassadors to the Principality of Albania.     3897-2                             C
                              GERMAN AFFAIRS.    It would appear that the position  of Dr. Michaelis is again being threatened bythe extreme Pan-Germans, who more than make up for the paucity of their  numbers.by THE energy of their political warfare.   The &quot; Vorwaerts,&quot; on  the other hand, VIEAVSthe action of Dr. Michaelis with suspicion.  He was enthusiastically approved by the pan- Germans when first appointed, and he has avoided committing himself in public as  to the LINE of policy he means to follow.  He failed somewhat  conspicuously on19th July, when he equivocated about his attitude to the Majority Resolution, and hehas so far failed to reply to the questions  about the future  of Belgium  asked byMr. Asquith in the House of Commons.    The Reichstag is to meet on 26th September, and  by that time  Dr. Michaelis, inhis reply to the Papal Note, can scarcely fail to have  antagonized further one or  both&apos;of the parties who have expressed their  displeasure with his lack of policy.  So far themost definite  item in the GhancelloFs political future is his reiterated undertaking tointroduce the promised reform in the Prussian franchise.    The&apos;Main Committee of  the  Reichstag has passed a  resolution demanding  a-considerable limitation in the power of the military over the censorship, and  has gone.so far as to  postulate  that the discussion of war aims and of constitutional questionsmust not be subject to the censorship, and that newspapers must be safeguarded fromarbitral suspension  by making the  Chancellor a  party  to  THE  suspension,  andobliging him to give his reasons to the publishers beforehand.    The occupation of Riga wdiich has been  trumpeted as a mighty victory and anetape towards the complete realisation of Pan-German aims in the East is less pleasingto the mass of German opinion.   In. some quarters it is feared that it may lead to the dissolution  of  Russia  into a  number of independent  Republics which might reactunfavourably upon German internal affairs.    The energies of the lower classes in  Germany appear for  the time being to be^entirely taken up with the task of existing, and their mental depression is remarkable.Mr. Maxse,  in  a  letter from  Rotterdam  to the  Foreign Office, refers  to the highlysatisfactory  and  progressive decrease  of  physical  efficiency  and the spread  ofintestinal troubles owing to malnutrition and monotony of diet.   While this all tends to decrease  the fighting value of the German nation as a whole,  it cannot be said withany confidence that it wdll produce an explosion of popular dissatisfaction of  sufficientmagnitude to affect the outcome of the war directly.  The governing class is  running the nation purely for  military purposes, and is  not  dismayed  in any  w&amp;y by the in-convenience to which the masses are put in the  process.  Matters  are so  arranged that persons whose labour is required for the AVELL-being of the military machine willbe kept alive but no. more,  and an official  statement assures the  hungry that the-supply of grain for bread for a whole year is now assured.    The milk and butter supply will be  permanently reduced to make up for  the  briefincrease of  the meat ration due to the autumn killing necessitated by lack of fodder.Apart from food, even  the Government is oppressed by the shortage of woollen fabrics,and military uniforms are known to have been mended, reshaped and pressed morethan half-a-dozen times during the course of a few months.   On the other hand, theGovernment,  with an  eye to the post helium economic future, is  believed to  haAreaccumulated a considerable stock of raw cotton.    Railway rolling  stock is deteriorating, and it is  probable that by now even thatappropriated for the requirements of the Army is suffering from strain and lack alikeof lubricating oil and repair facilities.    A report, not without  corroboration, is telegraphed by Sir  II. Rumbold that  anattempt to assassinate the Kaiser at Homburg during the first week of September was.so nearly successful that the Imperial chauffeur was killed.                             AUSTRIAN  AFFAIRS.   The Intelligence  Bureau  comments  upon  the  inclusion, for the first time  inAustrian history, of a Slovene and an Ukrainian in the Cabinet, a step Avhich isregarded Avith suspicion by Poles and Magyars as being indicative of  a friendly spirittowards the Jugoslavs and the Ruthenians.
JL    Reports as to tire internal condition of Austria-Hungary are  satisfactory from an allied point of view.  The Hungarian potato crop is very short owing to drought,and available supplies from the south, are reduced owing to a lack of other food  in bulgaria where, in consequence, the  amount  for  export is  correspondingly reduced.In Austria the national moral appears to  be sustained  by hopes  of a  speedy peace,hopes which may be nourished,  by  publication of  reports of victories  in Galicia, andby suppression of the news of defeats in the Carso.   The population is, on the otherhand, reported to  be plunged in an extraordinary state of moral  and physical apathyin  consequence  of  its  privations.   Hunger-typhus  has  begun to appear again.Official estimates are  confident that the supply of  flour, bread and potatoes for  thefourth year of the war will be adequate.  The harvest is, however, stated to be a totalfailure in Bohemia, Moravia and Galicia ;  it is bad  in Northern Hungary, and only fair in the  south ; though in places  the  wheat crops  are  expected  to  show a 10 or20 per cent, increase over the harvest of last year ;  barley and oats are very poor.    The Rumanian harvest is likely to prove  smaller than the public has been givento  understand,  but  there will probably  be a surplus  from  the Serbian  crop  for distribution among the populations of the Central Empires.                               NETHERLANDS.   The Foreign Office has had occasion to draw the attention of the Dutch Governmentto the continued despatch of  sand and gravel (used for German military purposes onthe West Front) to Belgium, and to demand an explanation.   On the  other  hand, Sir W. Townley reports that  Germany,  after supplying theNetherlands with only 110,000 tons of coal last  month, has  now refused to send any-coal at all across the frontier as a result of our assistance to the Dutch Government inthe coal  negotiations.   The Dutch Mission to the United States has made public  statements  to the  press to the effect that the Netherlands will refuse to be drawn into the Avar  unless actually-invaded.   The Foreisrn Office draws the attention of  the United  States  Government  to  the unsatisfactory nature of the Dutch  official trade statistics which giver rise to suspicion,and  suggests action.   The Dutch Foreign Minister in conversation with Sir W. Townley, confessed that owing to German pressure Avith a view to the obtaining of a  loan in connection withthe export into Holland of coal, cement, and.  steel, relations  between the netherlands and  Germany were by no means good.   One form of this pressure appears to havebeen the artificial creation of a AVAR scare.    As the  Dutch requirements of oils  and  fats for home  consumption havre been calculated at 9,000 tons a quarter, the British Government have unofficially requested.the United States  to require that all oils  and fats  imported into  Holland in excess ofthis amount shall  be used for the manufacture of margarine for the Allies.                                 SWITZERLAND.    As a result of  the  representations made by the Allies to Switzerland in order to:secure  au equality  of  treatment  in financial  facilities  between the Powers  of  theEntente and  the  Central Empires by the Swiss Banks, the necessary assurances havebeen given and the Swiss Economic Department is able to announce that the German-Swiss Economic Agreement has been ratified by both Governments.  It is understood..that the advances will, be for three years  at 7 per cent., and  the German Government Bills are  secured on  the mortgage bonds/of one German  Bank and endorsed  by another.   The amount to  be lent to Germany is to  be  governed by the amount ofcoal  to be supplied  in return to Switzerland, a stead3^ supply of 200,000 tons  of coalper month for nine months, entitling the Germans to borrow 20,000,000 francs  per month  during the same period.   It  is improbable that this supply will be maintained,. in which case the loan will be proportionately reduced.   The loan to the Entente to
he granted as a counterpoise to the Economic Agreement will  probably be taken up-equally by Great Britain and France, and probably upon  equal terms.   Owing to the -Allied action with  regard to  the  export of aluminium to Germany, by which that-export had to be suspended until the aluminium factories could prove that no mineraloil imported  under Allied licence was used in the preparation of this aluminium, theGerman  Government was obliged to impose a similar  restriction with regard to thepreparation of Swiss munitions for Allied use.  Thus  the Swiss  may not use German :coal for the benefit of the Allies, nor Allied  oil for the.benefit of the Germans.    In view  of the arrival of a  truck  of cocoa  consigned from  Holland  throughGermany to  Switzerland with its seals broken  and., part of its  contents missing, SirW. Townley has been instructed  to suspend the through traffic in cocoa and to  apply the same treatment  to the transit of sugar and malt as well.                                    SWEDEN.    The sensation caused by the diplomatic disclosures  is reported by Sir E. Howard to have had considerable effect.  An explanation, which has been published in full in the Press, put  out by the Swedish Foreign Office, is  characterised as a very weak attempt to excuse an inexcusable action, and in some Stockholm newspapers is referred to as absurd.    The Foreign Office instructed Sir E. Howard to protest to the Swedish Government. about the action of the Swedish Minister in Buenos Aires.    Sir E. Ploward learns that there was a Cabinet crisis on 10th September and that a number  of  Ministers wished the Government  to resign, but the  opposition parties declined to  form an Administration.    In a long  conversation  with the  Swedish  Foreign  Minister,  Sir  E.   Howard stigmatised the transmission of cypher telegrams for a belligerent as an unneutral act, and maintained that the publication  of the facts was fully justified in view of  previous Swedish assurances  on  this  point.  His Britannic majesty&apos;s Alinister disclaimed any intention on the part of Great Britain to change the existing form  cf government in Sweden, but pointed out that the action of the Swedish Government  and many of  its officials in the past had in numerous cases been directed to help the Germans  as much as possible to make difficulties for the Allies.    The amazing  part of  this conversation was  that the Minister for Foreign Affairs tendered no apology for the transmission  of German telegrams, but merely expressed profound regrets  at their contents.   He stated that he had sent  a vigorous protest to Berlin, asking for explanations and describing the German action in Buenos  Aires  as a gross breach  of faith.   The desirability of  obtaining permission  from the Swedish Government for the free transit of food supplies for Russia in view  of the  approach  of winter is pointed out in a Foreign Office telegram to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Washington.    Sir E. Howard, appreciates Sir AI. Findlay&apos;s remarks as to the danger of  allowing a  Swedish  warship, equipped with wireless, to patrol anywhere near an Allied traderoute ; but  points  out  that  the attacks  by Germans on Swedish fishing boats  had a marked effect in producing anti-German sentiment on the West  coast  of  Sweden,.and that it is desirable that coaling facilities be given to the Swedish warship  detailed for the protection of these people. The British Government has, however, decided not to grant the required facilities.   Sir E. Floward has received information from  the French Legation in Stockholm that the amount of  iron, ore  exported  from Sweden to  Germany  during  1917 is lessthan half the amount, pro rata, exported during 1916, and may be further reduced.                                   NORWAY.   The Foreign  Office having,  on&apos; 3rd  September (vide  Report No. 32), invited the-.United States to consider the question of naval co-operation in the event of Norway&apos;s.
entering the  war, and having communicated a copy to Sir M.  Findlay  the  latterreferred to the statement that &quot;the staff at the Admiralty recognise disadvantages &quot;from&apos;such a policy and asks for instructions as this appears to  indicate a  change ofpolicy towards Norway.   In reply  to  this the  Foreign Office explained to Sir  M. Findlay the change  in circumstances which for the time being made Norway&apos;s entry into the war undesirablefrom the Naval point of view, but instructed him not to discourage the  Cabinet ofChristiania from going to war if  they exhibited any wish to stand firm against german pressure.   Sir M. Findlay points out  that as Norway is now beginning to feel the pinch of theUnited  States  embargo the  time  is  ripe  for  the  first  step towards  getting  theNorwegian Government to  prohibit the  export .of all  goods  to  Holland  unlessconsigned to  and accepted by the Trust.                                  DENMARK.   Mr.  Gurney reports  tbat the Swedish diplomatic disclosures  are  expected,  ininfluential  Danish circles, to lead  to  a change of Government at Stockholm and a curtailment of the political activities of King Gustavus.   This would make co-operationeasier between Denmark and Sweden wdth a view to resisting German pressure.                                     SPAIN.   The Government of Madrid  has extended the Regulations for  the  navigation of spanish territorial -waters by submarines to the territorial waters of Spanish Morocco.   Sir A. Hardinge reports that the effervescence in Spain  has now  for the mostpart subsided, although arrests are still made and courts-martial still sit.   A German submarine which  is  understood  to have been damaged in action nearCadiz  on 7th  September, put  into  that  port  on  9th September, and has been interned.   The Spanish Government,  now that the import of  British coal into  the peninsulais permitted, provided that Spanish bottoms be used, are anxious to  export native coal for bunkering Spanish  steamers abroad.  As this would be a direct  interference with the Allied control of the bunkering of  shipping at large, the Foreign  Office is onlyprepared to permit this under  supervision.                                  PORTUGAL.   No solution  of  the  dispute  wdiich, in spite  of  concessions  on the part of theGovernment, has brought about  a complete paralysis of the  Portuguese postal andtelegraphic services has as yet been found.   The postal strike developed on 10th September into a general strike.  This led tothe non-appearance of newspapers and  a general cessation  of  business which hadalready been  somewhat disorganised during the previous 10 days owing to the lack of postal deliveries.                                   SERBIA.                                      I    In spite of various difficulties and the  representations made by Sir G. Barclay, it I is probable that the Serbian and Czech troops in South Russia wdll be  despatched on I the way to Macedonia before the northern ports are closed by ice.                    1    The  Serbian  Minister  in  Washington  has informed  His Britannic  Majesty&apos;s I Ambassador that some 2,000 Serbians have enrolled for service in  the Serbian Army, 1 the United States Authorities having no objections to such action on the part of those Inot subject to the  United States Draft.    3897-2                             D
                                    CHINA.   . The Japanese Foreign Minister has stated  that  he strongly advised emissaries ofthe Southern Party in China not to embark upon open  opposition to the Governmentof Peking, the only danger to which was, in  his opinion, the differences of opinion between General  Tuan and  General Feng  and  their  respective  adherents.   Heprofessed himself assured that  the  Government of  Washington  was  prepared to welcome Japan as an ally, as shown by the reception of the mission of  Viscount Ishiiin the United States, and was anxious that that statesman should dispel the unfoundedsuspicions (based  on accusations sedulously  fostered  by the enemy propaganda in north America) that Japan wishes to &quot; grab &quot;  China.    The  French Government has notified  Japan that it  accepts  the proposals forameliorating the internal condition of China contained in the Japanese Memorandum.These proposals have already been concurred  in  by Great Britain, and  it is under-stood that the attitude  of Washington is also favourable.    The tension which was at one time reported in  the Press to exist between Chinaand the Netherlands owing to the action  of the Dutch Minister in taking  over the arms  of the  German and Austrian Legation Guards  just before the declaration of warby  China,  is now  declared  by the  Dutch  Foreign  Office to have  been  greatlyexaggerated.    Mr. Alston refers to the difficulties of getting rid of the enemy subjects from China ;as they number 4,000 souls it is impossible to send them in one party as was originallydesired.   SpeciaFsafe conducts reserving right of search and  of limited duration havebeen accorded by the Allied Ministers in Peking to the Austrian Minister and his staff,10 persons in all.    The postponed discussion of  the settlement of  the relief to be accorded to theChinese Government in the matter of the payment of the indemnity led  to reservationson the part of the Italian and Russian Ministers.  The  former could give no definite answer, while the latter was prepared to accord a proportional postponement in view ofthe greater amount affected in the case of Russia.                                     JAPAN.   The Japanese Government are  understood to be on  the  point  of  establishing control of shipping, shipbuilding&apos;and freights, and expects to negotiate  about buildingships for the United States in  Japanese yards.                                 ARGENTINA.   The Foreign Office has  requested  the United States Glovernment to stop all coalcargoes for the River Plate as neutrals  are  arranging to ship American  coal to thePlate ports and await grain cargoes for the return voyage, thereby at once weakeningthe United States coal control over the Argentine and  enhancing the price of grainagainst the Allies.  The Government  of Washington, however, according to a message from Sir C. Spring Rice, has already adopted a policy of licensing the export to SouthAmerica at  large of binder twine, sisal  and hemp  for the  sacking  of  the comingharvest only in exchange  for guarantees that no grain is to  be sold to  EuropeanNeutrals without the express approval of the United States.   Sir R. dower has been assured by  the Argentine Miznster for Agriculture that theproposed requisitioning of  jute will only be used  to prevent  speculation and not ina  manner to  injure private interests.  His  Britannic Majesty&apos;s  Minister,  however,suggests that the jute which will shortly  be  required  for the sacks to contain Alliedpurchases of Argentine wheat had  better be consigned to the British  Legation inUruguay whence there will be no difficidty in exportingdt when  needed.   Sir P. Tower reports that  the  publication of  the  telegrams sent by the german minister in Buenos Aires through the Swedish  Legation  to Berlin  has caused an immense sensation,  but the present  indication is that the Argentine  government desire to make  the matter a personal question involving the departure of the german minister rather than a political question leading to a rupture of diplomatic relations.
                                   &apos; BRAZIL.   The voyages of ex-German ships from Brazil are causing difficulties.  The chilean government has declared that it will not detain one such vessel, but the argentine government has disclaimed  responsibility  for the action of the Argentine  Judicialauthorities should the ship come within their jurisdiction, and it is  stiggested thatBritish patrols should pass  this  craft in order to avoid any necessity for the BritishGovernment to come toTHlecision at present on the principle  involved.   meanwhile the Brazilian Government has  not  given the necessary assurances with regard tothe em ployment of other ex-enemy ships and  the  question  arises are such  ships tobe repaired in Allied yards failing such assurances ?   Sir C. Spring Rice reports that the United States are unwilling to put  pressure onBrazil in  the matter of the non-recognition  of transfer  of flag in the case of theseex-enemy ships  on the ground that Brazil might be held responsible for  the german ships after the war and become liable to an indemnity.  The State Department proposestentatively that  the United States might buy the ships and  hold  the purchase-moneytill after the war for account of  whom it may concern, using the ships in the  south american trade  meanwhile.   The State Department rjrefers that Great Britain shouldexert such pressure as may be necessary.    Sir A. Peel reports that the  Brazilian Minister for  Foreign Affairs is  prepared to direct that cargo space be in future refused  in Brazilian ships to firms on the StatutoryList in return for the notification of the names of  Brazilian firms or persons  proposed for inclusion in  that list.  The Minister does not stipulate for a revision of the list.                                    PERU.   Mr.  Rennie  reports  that  the Peruvian  Government warned  Germany  on 9thSeptember that the German attitude in sending no reply to  the two Peruvian notes on the  subject  of  the  sinking of the &quot; Lorton &quot; was considered unfriendly.   Theproposal of the German Minister that the question should be submitted to arbitrationwas  met with assurance  that Peru  must insist upon  the indemnity and guaranteesalready demanded.   The Minister for Foreign Affairs is reported to have  stated in  the secret session of congress on  7th  September  that  the Peruvian  Government  intended  to  break offrelations with Germany shordd  the  answer of the  German Government to the twoNotes be unsatisfactory.                                    MEXICO.   In view of Senior carranza&apos;s speech at the re-opening of the Mexican  Congress on1st September (vide Report No. 32), the State Department in  Washington assured sir c. Spring  Rice that no interference with  the  oil-fields  will  be permitted by  theUnited States.   With regard to the audhgiious official recognition of Sehor Carranza as President ofMexico by the  United States, the  State  Department  explained  that  while  the letterof recognition  was not drawn up according to precedent, it  was couched in a form which was intended to give satisfaction to Carranza as it was desirable to keep on goodterms with him as long as possible.   The head of the Mexican  Department assuredHis  Britannic  Majesty&apos;s Ambassador that  the recognition  would  make little  realdifference, as the fixed policy of Washington was to refuse to tolerate any retroactiveor confiscatory legislation in Mexico regardless  of provisions to that effect in the  newconstitution.   Mr. Cummins reports that the Mexican Government has obtained  legal powers totake over and work all textile factories that  close down  in  connection  with  the suspension of work at certain cotton factories.                 *   The Inter-Departmental Committee on petroleum products has commended that regulation should be issued, to prevent Messrs.

                                     CHILE. &apos;    The action of the United  States Congress in  appropriating a large sum for themanufacture of artificial nitrate  is being  used  as a  lever  to  induce  the  chilean government to requisition German steamers in Chilean ports and employ them forthe transport of natural nitrates.  Should  this be  done it  would be  unnecessary toproduce  the artificial variety and the prosperity of the Chilean industry would besecured.   The  moment is favourable for  the application of this economic pressure asHis Britannic Majesty&apos;s Minister in Santiago reports that the fear of Germany is nowwaning among the Chileans.   The Government is again  in  treaty for  the acquisitionof. German-owned  nitrate  properties,  and it is  possible that this action has  beenindirectly brought about by the United  States Government, as the  Chilean Govern-ment has expressed its willingness to complete the sale of the German owned nitrateitself (200,000 tons)  to the Dupont Powder  Company, the nominees of the  UnitedStates Navy Department,  provided  that both Great Britain and the United Statesconsent.   The  Foreign Office  was unwilling  that so  considerable a sum  as  thatinvolved  should  be paid  to German interests, but the State Department insist uponthe necessity for the mdve owing to the urgent need  for nitrate in the United Statesand the fact that it  would expose the Chilean  Government to United States pressurewith  regard to the control and  use  of  German ships in Chilean waters.   Mr.  Birdreports on  5th. September  from  Antofagasta  that the strikes in the nitrate fields arenow over.                                 VENEZUELA.   Mr. Beaumont announces  that during the week  President Gomez has dismissedthe Ministers of the Interior, and of Commerce, Colonies and Education for venturingto oppose the  arrest of  members of  the  German spy organization, and has appointedan elderly but  inexperienced  physician  to  direct the foreign relations of  the  State.A Senator, of  pro-Ally leanings,  has been  arrested, apparently for having read and expressed approval of a Theosophical publication.  The President&apos;!? &quot; dossier,&quot; withits record of  arbitrary arrests, plunder of private property,  and  misappropriation ofpublic monies, has now  been forwarded, to Washington by the United  States Ministerat Caracas as a preliminary  to  that forcible removal wdiich, in  the  opinion of the diplomatic Body, is the only remedy for the Gomez regime.                                   URUGUAY.    The Republic of Uruguay is  bargaining  with the Allies  as to  the disposal of theGerman ships lying in her harbours.  They are at present undamaged, and theRepublic wras at first  anxious to secure  an Arbitration Treaty  according to  whichall disputes between the Republic and Great Britain are to be settled by arbitration.The Foreign Office points out that this is manifestly impossible but that Great  britain is disposed to accept a Treaty which allows of  arbitration for questions other thanthose of a  justiciable nature, which are to be referred for investigation and reportby a Commission, and pending the discussion of these proposals, which have also beensubmitted to France and Italy, suggests that the  Republican Government should takegood care that the German ships remain undamaged.    The Italian Minister for Foreign Affairs informed Sir R. Rodd that he had  been obliged some time ago to disavow the action of the Italian Minister  in Montevideo  insigning  an  Arbitration Treaty with-  Uruguay   in which all matters  with  whichUruguayan Tribunals were competent to deal were excluded from arbitration, and wasin consequence  not disposed to  favour  the British proposal that the three  allied representatives in Uruguay should discuss the matter  and report to their respective governments.    Mr. Mitchell Innes  reports that the proposed British modification excites so  muchsuspicion that the Uruguayan Minister for Foreign Affairs begs that it  will  not be insisted upon.
   It appears that the machinery of the ships has already heen damaged, hut  theUruguayan Government is disposed to prevent further  damage  being done providedthat  an agreement be reached as to the terms of the Treaty.                                  ECUADOR.   While welcoming the prospect of a rupture between the Republic of Ecuador andGermany (see  last Report), Iiis  Majesty&apos;s Government has  intimated that the pricedemanded  is too high.   Coal can be given, but  not the tonnage to convey it; theimportation of cocoa from Ecuador into Great Britain cannot be allov-ecl, and a loan to the Republican treasury  is out of the question.   But  His Britannic  Majesty&apos;minister has been instructed to make what play he can with  the Ecuadorean  ForeignMinister, who is to be placated, if possible, with the prospect of an unimpeded import of jute.   In any case the assistance to be rendered by Ecuador is considered as beingchiefly of a moral nature.  -                              UNITED   STATES.   A number  of documents proving that the Swedish Legation  in  Buenos Aires wasin the habit of transmitting telegrams in cypher from the German Minister to Berlinwere published as having been  intercepted by the  United States  Intelligence.   as some of the messages contained information to enable commanders of submarines to sink  Argentine ships public opinion was roused.   Efforts were  made in officialquarters to direct public indignation against the Swedish Government as being aloneto blame, and  not against the Swedish people at large, and  the British government made representations as  to  the  undesirability of a breach  wdth  Sweden at this juncture.   German propaganda  is known to be  strong in the United  States Army, but theBritish Naval  Attache who attended the Bar Association meeting at  Saratoga reportsthat the growth of  anti-German sentiment was greatly  helped by the speech ofM. Delaval, the Belgian delegate.  On 5th September Lord Robert  Cecil exchangedviews with the American Ambassador who referred to the impression prevalent in theUnited States that the British were making use of  the present international  situationin order to obtain trade advantages.  Lord Robert Cecil mentioned the reports currentin South America, that American traders were taking advantage of the dislocation ofBritish trade throughout that Continent, in order to forward United States commercial interests.   Lord Northcliffe has  asked  for the appointment of the best  available  scientistpossessing knowledge of chemistry and engineering to the British War Mission.  Heis very anxious that that body should not come to be regarded in the United  states as a mere begging machine, and instances the superior equipment and greater successof the French and  other missions.  He also points out that the whole force  of theGerman and  Irish propaganda  is  directed  solely against  Great  Britain, while thevigorous activities of the French meet with no organised opposition.    It is suggested that the United States  should   earmark $200,000,000 in the forth-coming loan to France to be advanced to  Great Britain.   This may be partly due toCongressional  necessities, and is welcomed by His  Majesty&apos;s Treasury as  being inaccordance with its proposed policy and as enabling the Treasury to provide Francewith funds to  finance purchases within Great Britain  or  other parts of  the Empireother than Canada.    Direct loans to the amount of  Sp 60,000,000 have  been made  during the week bythe United States Treasury to His Majesty&apos;s Government.    The British Coal Exports Committee is anxious to co-ordinate the control exercised by Licensing Authorities severally responsible  for  the export of  coal from GreatBritain and the United  States, and has asked that a list may be furnished weekly ofall licences given for American shipments  to  Europe and South America these beingthe areas where overlapping may otherwise occur.    The sulphur shortage in the  United States is  so marked that in  spite of efforts onthe part of the Government to impove the home production, the  importation of Spanishpyrites is still essential.   It will be remembered  that this  generally entails shipmentfrom Hueiva (60 miles north-west of Cadiz), which is one of the most dangerous ports in the peninsula.     3897-2                               E
   The Government of Gibraltar has announced that as no Treaty of Alliance exists between Great  Britain  and the  United States,  the status of  the citizens  of  thatRepublic has had to be specially defined at Gibraltar, the term &quot; Ally &quot; is now takento mean the citizen or subject of any Power now at war with  the German Empire or with any State at war  with Great Britain.                            SHIPPING  SITUATION.    Idle  Brazilian Government are reluctant to permit  the transfer from the Brazilian flag of the fleet of the Commercial and  Navigation Company which would naturally ensue upon the  proposed sale agreed between that  company and  Messrs.  Arthur Capel &amp; Co.,  of London.  The company,  which rescinded its  contract with the Brazilian Government on 6th  September, is, however, willing  to  charter  its fleet of 28,600 tons gross for a lump sum equivalent to  80,000Z. per month.  The Holland Steamboat Company is proposing to resume its service from the Netherlands to Great Britain.   The  gross tonnage of its fleet exceeds 10,000  tons.    According  to the War Trade Intelligence  Report, the total tonnage, over 500 tons gross in the case of steamers and 100 tons gross in the case of sailing ships, reported lost  owing to the  malice of the Iving&apos;s  enemies  during the  period 31st August- 6th September inclusive, is 123,355 tons, of which 82,905 was British.    The  Shipping Controller, in  considering  the proposal that  Great Britain  should relinquish control of all neutral  tonnage now under charter to Americans, points out that  oldstanding agreements among  the Allies  are  in existence, made while the United  States were  still neutral,  whereby all  the   tonnage  available  was  to  be employed to secure  the war operations  of  the Allies as allocated by the Inter-Allied Chartering Committee in London.  This control  should not be  abandoned if the tonnage released were to pass under that of a Shipping Board, wdiich would naturally tend to overestimate the importance of its own American interests  in relation to the general  interests  of the Allies.   The Shipping Controller is anxious that American representatives should be appointed on the Inter-Allied Chartering Committee.    Sir C. Spring Rice reports that the United States Government are inclined to agree to the equal division of the  ex-enemy ships  in  China between Great Britain, Japan and themselves, but except three ships  as having been  purchased by the American Mohawk Company just before China abandoned  her neutrality which they desire to retain.   The  State  Department  points  out  that  if the  third, parts will  naturally be\smaller the wdiole of the United States share as well as  the three ships referred to will?he used  in Allied interests, while the Japanese Government is unable to make use of its share in that way.    Mr. Lyle reports that the Siamese ex-enemy ships are  expected to be clear of the Prize Court soon after 18th September, but that the Siamese Government is unwilling to repair them until  after their condemnation.   The Foreign  Office points  out on 5th September that  it is anxious to leave the negotiations with Japan as to the disposal of these  ships as much as  possible in the hands of the  United States, but Washington on 11th  September prefers to suggest that the Siamese  should not hand the ships over to Japan in order that other negotiations between the  United  States  and  Tokyo may not be complicated by this fresh question.    Sir C. Spring Rice reports that as a result of  the [meeting of  the Conference to consider the question  of the  tightening of  shipping control and  export  regulations from the United States it  has been decided  to establish immediately an  inspection system for the adequate enforcement of  the United States export prohibitions, and. that as the reasoned defence of the general inspection at Halifax by the British Govern- ment was appreciated there was no question of dispensing with  the compulsory call at Halifax  in the immediate future.                            PEACE DISCUSSIONS.   Sir E. Howard reports  that  M.  Huysmans,  seeing that a general  meeting  of belligerent and neutral Socialists is now impossible at Stockholm,  is anxious  toarrange for one conference in London to be composed of Allied Socialists Avith someneutrals, and another conference in Vienna for the benefit of the Socialists  from theCentral Empires and other neutrals.
   The Belgian Government have decided to refrain for the moment from replying tothe Papal Note, but, as a matter of courtesy, have instructed their Minister to explain the reasons for this lack of action to the Cardinal Secretary of State.  The Russian replywill  be in accordance with the sentiments already expressed by the Western Allies,and a public announcement is to be made of the Governments approval  of PresidentWilson&apos;s Note to the Pope.   The French Ambassador, in  a conversation at the  Foreign Office shortly after thedespatch of the Papal Note, deplored the want of action on the  part  of the  Popeduring the war, and expressed  the opinion that the  indecision of the  Vatican would tend to widen the politico-religious breach in France.   On 7th September Lord Bertie reported that the French Government concurred inthe opinion of His Majesty&apos;s Government that it is not necessary for  the Allied Powers,after President Wilson&apos;s Note, to send any further reply to the. Pope&apos;s peace proposals,and that it is for the  Central Powers to  repby thereto.  In this connection, a Germancorrespondent of &quot; De Tyd &quot; (8th September),  reports that the Commission of theFederal Council and Reichstag engaged  in drafting Germany&apos;s reply, is  in favour of restoring independence to  Belgium within certain limitations.  Belgium would be debarred  from concluding with one  or more  of  the  Entente Powers any  separateagreements  affecting her independence ; she would only  be allowed to maintain  a defensive force sufficient for the maintenance of internal order ;  and the  principle of&quot;administrative separation,&quot; already introduced, would have to  be maintained.   her independence, in fact, would be  limited to conform to the exigencies of  german policy.   The French Ambassador, at an audience with President Wilson, took  exception tocertain passages in  his reply  to the  Papal peace note, as likely  to   give rise  to difficulties and dangers  in the future.  The  President explained  that   he was compelled to have regard for public opinion, which, in some respects, was lukewarmabout  the war.  Sir C. Spring  Rice observes, in this connection, that recent electionshave not, been favourable for the Democratic Party and President Wilson  is  evidentlyimpressed with the  necessity for preventing any serious change in public  opinion.    In a conversation which took place between  Sir Percy Loraine and the Marquis ofLema  at Santander  last  month on the subject of the Pope&apos;s peace proposals, theMarquis conveyed an impression that  he saw  no  prospect of the Vatican&apos;s proposalsbeing-accepted as a basis of peace negotiations by the belligerents,  but that Spain was naturally bound to  express in  general  terms  her sympathy for so high a religiousauthority as His Holiness.   The Minister told Sir Percy Loraine that he had not seen the full text of the  Pope&apos;s proposals until after they had been made public ; ncverthe-less, Sir A. Hardinge has  reason to believe that the Marquis was fully informed oftheir purport in advance, and had even  told a member of the Diplomatic Body thatGermany would be  prepared to restore Alsace Lorraine  to France in return for theretrocession of all  the German Colonies.   In  conversation with this same diplomat,His Majesty the King expressed the opinion that the Allies would  do well to accept a compromise ; when  assured  of  the absolute determination of all  classes in Englandand France to break Prussian militarism, he is reported to have replied, &quot; That is nolonger necessary ; I can assure you that  it is already broken.&quot;    On the 11th of September  Sir C. Spring Rice reported that the American press had published a new peace offer received through the  Dutch Legation.   Mr.  Lansing,referring thereto, has expressed the opinion that the actual terms of this offer are nota matter of importance.  The essential feature  of the situation is that German agents in the United States are making every effort to  create  a peace atmosphere and  above all to inculcate the idea that the President should impose terms on  both  sides.  Theyare exploiting the fall of M. ribot&apos;s Ministry as  evidence that France is  weary of the war.   His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador observes  that there  still  exists a  wide   difference of opinions about the  war in various parts of the country, but the  general feeling in congress is satisfactory.   Mr. Denman, ex-Chairman of the Shipping Board, continuesactive in  the manipulation of public opinion in directions antagonistic  to  GreatBritain.    The American Secretary of  State  denies having made the remarks  attributed tohim in the Press, according to which he advocated the  overthrow of the House ofHohenzollern as a necessary  preliminary to  Peace.  A &quot; change  of character &quot;in theGerman Government is all that is required.    According to the &quot; Neue Politische Correspondenz,&quot; Dr. Solf, the Colonial Secretary,adheres  to  his  opinion that the restoration  of Germany&apos;s Colonies is an essential     3S97 -2                                F
condition  of  peace,  The fact that Dr. Solf,  holding this opinion, retains his officeunder Michaelis, is regarded as proof that the future of German Colonial development is assured.   The &quot;Vorwarts&quot;  of 9th September  published an interview  between  Hen-Scheiclemann and a representative  of the American Associated Press.  Scheidemannprofesses  to  regard President WilsoiFs reply to  the  Papal Note as essentially  inagreement with the fundamental principles  of  the  Reiclistag;s peace resolution,  bothbeing  equally opposed  to annexations, political  coercion, and economic barriers.  IfPresident Wilson does not regard  as  acceptable the present  German Governmentsguarantees for future peace, it is, he  thinks, because he  underestimates the strengthof the  Reichstag and of the movement towards democracy in Germany.  Apart fromthe prospects of peace  by agreement, he considers  that, after the present struggle, nonation will be able  to make war  for  at  least  a generation ;  thus peace is  assured by exhaustion&apos;, and the forms of guarantees should be found in the peace negotiations.    On 6th September, Sir E. Howard  reported that delegates for the  ZimmerwaldConference had arrived at Stockholm, namely, four Germans (including  Haase andLedebour),  two Roumanians; and  four  Russians.   The  Swiss  are sending  twodelegates.  Sir H. Rumbold understands that  the Zimmerwald gathering will boycottthe  official Stockholm  Conference.   The  lack  of peace amongst the  peacemakersbecomes daily more remarkable.    Referring to the rumours which have lately appeared in the British and french press on the  subject of  an alleged meeting  between German and Allied  financiers  inSwitzerland, Sir H. Rumbold  has reported that the  rumour in so  far  as  it suggestedpeace  manoeuvres was deliberately fastened  on. to a purely financial  business by the&quot;Vorwarts.&quot;  The  truth,  it  seems, is  that Austrian  and  German  financiers wereanxipus to sell foreign securities in Switzerland, and the Swiss, unwilling to give cash,endeavoured to get German and Austrian securities, to  exchange for them, from theEntente.   M. Caillaux and other French financiers, with  an  Englishman and certainAmericans, are  said to have  come from Paris to discuss the business at Zurich, but without meeting the enemy financiers.   In this connection it  is  to be  noted  thatM. Caillaux has published a statement declaring that he has  not  been in Switzerlandfor seven  years.                                   GENERAL.   The respectful thanks  of  His Majesty&apos;s Government have  been conveyed  to HisMajesty the King of  Spain  for his successful intervention  in  the  matter of german submarine attacks upon hosprital ships in the Mediterranean.  An agreement has nowbeen reached whereby Gerinanj^ undertakes that these vessels will not be attacked.   The German Government  have made representations, through  the  Swiss Charged&apos;Alfaires in London, on the subject of  the transfer of German interned prisoners  inCanada from Kingston Fort to Kapuskasing; they consider  that  the  latter place, onaccount of its rigorous  climate, is not suited for unacelimatised  prisoners, and they therefore request that it be abolished as a place of internment.  If they do not receive a satisfactory reply within four weeks, an equal number of English  civilian  prisonerswill  be transferred  to  occupied  Russian territory.  His Majesty&apos;s  Government have referred the matter to the Canadian Government for enquiry and report.   As a reprisal  for the  detention  of Ayoub  Sabri, the  Turkish authorities havearrested two  British subjects,  Messrs. Maclean and  Wigram.   They  threaten  toimprison  the entire British  Colony unless Ayoub  Sabri  is released  before 25thSeptember, their contention being that his detention is illegal  (in view of  the  manner of his arrest on board a neutral vessel), and  that as his case has nothing in common with ordinary prisoners of war, it cannot be discussed, for  purposes of exchange, asproposed  by His  Majesty&apos;s  Government.   The Turkish Government  are  evidentlytemporising with regard to the proposed general Conference on the prisoners question,but Sir 11. Rumbold learns that  they have  appointed as  their representatives TewfikBey, of the Turkish  Foreign Office, and Tewfik Hadi  Bey, of  the Political  Section ofPolice.   In spite of the formal assurances to  the contrary given by the Russian Government,it  appears that negotiations have  been  carried on  by  Russian delegates, actingindependently of the Cabinet  of Petrograd, for the mutual repatriation by Russia and austria-Hungary across the battle-frqnt of able-bodied unwounded prisoners  of  war.
Whether or no  this is  an example of extreme decentralisation,  due to democraticdevelopment, is  a matter of small moment compared with the extremely  dangerouspossibilities of the policy of exchanging fit prisoners of war who, on the one side willbecome amenable to German-directed discipline, while on the other they  will merelybecome members of the Russian Army.   His Majesty&apos;? Government concur in the recommendation of Sir W. Townley thatGeneral  Williams  should exercise general  supervision over  all Departments andSocieties dealing with British prisoners of war in Holland, and  that the  British red cross (and not the Dutch) should have the care of these prisoners.    His Majesty&apos;s Government have authorised Sir M. Findlay to give  a letter to theNorwegian  Red Cross,  agreeing  to  their sending  parcels  to prisoners  of war inGermany, Austria, and Russia, on the understanding that  the  Society shall furnishHis Majesty&apos;s Legation with a monthly statement  of the quantities of articles thusexported.   Following upon the decision recorded at  the recent Conference at The  Hague  onthe subject of prisoners of war, His Majesty&apos;s Government  submitted  to  the german authorities, through the Dutch, the  text of a notification which they proposed to issue in the British  and neutral Press ; simultaneously with  a  similar notification by theGermans, warning all senders of  parcels  addressed  to prisoners of war against theinclusion in such parcels of articles intended  for the destruction of life or property.The agreed purpose of this notification is to  enable the authorities  in both countries to relax the rigorous censorship) and consequent delay in the delivery of parcels.  the text of the notification proposed by the  German  Government (forwarded by Sir W.Townley on 8th September) proves, however, to be  entirely one-sided  and open tomisconstruction that His Majesty&apos;s Government have been  unable  to  agree to it, andthe date of publication is therefore postponed pending its reconsideration.    On 12th September the Lord High Chancellor and the  Speaker of the House ofCommons  communicated  with  the Vice-President of  the  United  States and the speaker of the House of Representatives, inviting as many members  of  both houses of Congress as may be willing to come to visit Great Britain  and the British  frontas guests of the British people.
