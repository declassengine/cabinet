SECRET.APPRECIATION  OF  THE  ATTACHED  WESTERN  AND  GENERAL                           REPORT,  No.  36.                           THE EMPIRE  AND THE WAR.   This week s budget of Imperial news,  comprising the speeches of Mr. Hughes andGeneral Botha against an inconclusive peace further evidence of the firm attitude ofthe Canadian Government over the carrying into effect of compulsory service, and thepatriotic resolve of the New Zealand Parliament to waive their proposals for leave tothe troops in the interests of military efficiency certainly shows  no signs  of ;anyflagging of the spirit in wdiich the British Empire is  euteriug  upon the fourth winter of the Avar.                              IMPERIAL PREFERENCE.   Sir C.  Spring Rice&apos;s suggestion that the existing  system of Imperial preference inthe West Indies should  be suspended in view of the American food economy campaignopens up  an alarming vista of similar proposals for upsetting the domestic financialand fiscal arrangements of the British Empire as a testimony  of our  appreciation ofthe efforts of our Allies.  To accede to it will  be to make  the absurd admission thatany terms of internal preference within the Empire constitute  ipso facto an unfriendlyact against our Allies.  It is not  suggested, apparently, that the American preferencein the Philippines should be  suspended  in  appreciation of the services of Australiaand Japan to the common cause.                                     CANADA.    The retirement of Sir  W. Laurier from  the  Liberal  leadership,  if confirmed,will not only mark the end  of  an  era in Canadian politics, but may  have a  decisiveeffect upon the whole complexion of political events  in the immediate future.                              THE &quot; AFFAIRE  BOLO.&quot;    The Bolo &quot; Pasha &quot;  affair becomes more  mysterious and more inconsequent Avitheach fresh, revelation.   It is difficult to decide  at present whether the facts  throw  amore unfavourable light on the internal  situation in France where such a humbugcould llourish, or on the German secret service which could squander its money anddepreciate the mark on  so  egregious a pantomime villain.  His connection withCaillaux and Giolitti, if confirmed, shows how far the ramifications of German briberyhave spread in Allied countries,  and suggests that, even in  this country, pacifist andrevolutionary movements may have  their  stimulus in something more directly practicalthan mere doctrinaire crankiness.  No doubt even an East End air raid panic can  be improved by a little judicious expenditure and organisation.
                                JAPAN  AND CHINA.   Viscount  r.shii&apos;s proclamation at Washington of a Japanese &quot; Monroe doctrine &quot; for china, is immeuseiy significant, not only as  regards Japanese policy in  the Far East,but as regards the whole trend of world  policy towards the division of the world intoa limited number of large groups or protected areas.  Such a division, if each area  is substantially self-contained and affords room &quot;for the national and economic aspirations of the peoples comprised, within it, is in itself a substantial guarantee of stability and peace in the  future.  The  process is, consequently, one to be encouraged and kept in view in the eventual settlement at the close of the war.                                peace E  DISCUSSIONS.    Count CzcrniiPs last speech shows  the  characteristic defects of Teutonic  cookery;the millennium custard is almost too luscious to be really palatable.   In substance his proposal is that Austria will refrain from territorial annexations  if we will  agree  to disband the British Navy.4th October 1917.L. S. A.

PART   I.-BRITISH  EMPIRE  AND  AFRICA.                                   CANADA.   Sir Wilfrid Laurier, in addressing a gathering of the Liberal. Party at Ottawa on 3rd October, announced his intention of resigning from the Leadership of the liberal party.   It is understood that a party convention will be  held shortly to consider thethe choice of a successor.   From a speech delivered this week  by the Minister of  Trade and  Commerce (sir george Foster) it is concluded that the General  Election will not  take place beforeJanuary or February of next year.  &quot; We shall, take up four months, and may be five,&quot;Sir George Foster declared, &quot; in making the  necessary arrangements for  carrying onthe war both before and. during the election in Canada.&quot;   Comparing  the  casualties  at  the Front  with  the enlistments in the Dominion forthe first two weeks  of September,  Sir George  Foster stated  in the above-mentionedspeech  that they showed conclusively the  need  for the  immediate  enforcement  of conscription whether  the, election was delayed or  not.  &quot;It would only take eight months of that  kind  of  action, or rather inaction,&quot; he  added, &apos;; to wipe  out everyDivision we have at the Front.&apos;&apos;   The issue of the Proclamation calling up men under the Military Service Act willnot take place  before the middle of October.  It is anticipated that only unmarriedmen between the ages of 20 and 34, who  are fit for combatant service, will be affectedby the  first Proclamation.  The  Board of  Selection, which  was  established for  thepurpose of choosing one  member on each of the Local ddibunals,  has adjourned till9th October without selecting all  the  nominees.   The postponement and consequentdelay has arisen through the absence of the Saskatchewan members of  tho Board, but many of the appointments of other Provinces have been practically completed.   Mean-time 90 Medical Boards are at work in different centres in the country, examining menwho are desirous of ascertaining  their  medical  category before being called  to theColours.  The Military Service Council has issued  a  statement  upon  arrangementsfor exemption.   Employers may ask for exemption of men who are physically fit on theground (I) that  the national interest demands that the man should, be left at his work ;(2) that, the man should be placed on work for which,  he has special qualifications ;(3) that it is expedient in the  national interest  that the man should continue to  beeducated  or  trained  for any  work.  Relatives may apply for exemption on the samegrounds, or for some  special  domestic reason.   It has been decided  not  to  exemptcertain listed  occupations, as  originally  proposed, and each individual  case for exemption, therefore, will be considered solely on its merits.   A further Conference of  Western Liberals has been called in order to consider theattitude to be adopted in view of the forthcoming General Election.    The stonework of  the new Parliament Buildings has been almost finished, and  itis expected that the whole building will be completed in two years.    The Dominion  Marine  and Fisheries  Department is considering jointly with theShipping Board of the  United States the matter of transferring vessels  engaged onthe Great Lakes to  oversea service.                              NEWFOUNDLAND.   His Majesty the King has approved of the appointment of Mr. Charles AlexanderHarris, of the Colonial Office, to be Governor and Commander-in-Chief of Newfound-land, in succession to Sir Walter Davidson.   His Majesty has given directions for the promotion of Mr. Harris to be a Knight&apos;Commander of  the Order of St.  Michael and at . George.   The Government have announced that if sufficient men are not forthcoming underthe present voluntary recruiting methods, selective conscription will be enforced.
                      AUSTRALIAN  COMMONWEALTH.   The Prime Minister (Mr. Hughes),  in a speech at Bendigo,  said that without theBritish Navy liberty would  have been  lost to Australia.  With reference to  peaceprospects, he said  there could be no permanent peace, and  no peace of any sort,except that which  would prevent the recurrence of such a war.  It  was as senseless,wrong, and immoral, he added, to urge a premature  peace as to  urge peace betweengood and evil.   The Prime Minister has  given  an assurance to  the  Leader of  the  Opposition(Mr. Tudor)  that the Government have no intention  of introducing  conscription bymeans of a Government Regulation.   On  the motion for  adjournment  of the Federal  Parliament, which took place on27th  September, the Prime Minister announced that the House of  representatives would probably reassemble in the third week of November.   Before the adjournment, the Federal Parliament passed the Bill taxing bachelorsand  childless, widowers 57,. or  5  per cent, of their  incomes, whichever should&apos; be greater (vide Report No. 35).  Men  permanently incapacitated  with  incomes  belowI50L  and men over 60  receiving below 100L are exempted.   . A  Bill  was  also passed  appointing, a salaried Minister of Repatriation.    TheMinister will be assisted by an  honorary Commission  of six, including two returnedsoldiers or sailors.   Senator Millen has been sworn in as Minister of Repatriation..   The Prime Minister in addressing the WomeiFs  National League referred to thegreat  need  of increased  population  in  the  Commonwealth.  Jie said it would be necessary  to devise a policy which would attract tens of thousands of British soldiersand other persons  from overseas.   The coal strike in New South Wales  is practically at an end, as the Southern and western Miners&apos; Lodges  have  decided, almost unanimously,  to accept the  Govern-menfs terms.   The Commonwealth Government have expressed their  readiness to receive,  if required, enemy deportees from China  for internment,  providing that  the ChineseGovernment bear all expenses, including the cost of transport.                               NEW  ZEALAND.   With reference  to  the  proposals of the New Zealand Government  for extendedleave to members of.  the  original New Zealand Expeditionary  Force,  and to  theobjections  raised by the War Office (vide Reports  Nos. 32 and 35), the House ofRepresentatives in Secret Session have passed the following resolution :    &quot; The Members of the New Zealand House of Representatives  at this Conference       assembled,. with  all  the  information which has  been  supplied to them,       unanimous^, but  most  regretfully, agree  that the proposals  for giving      - furlough to the  main body so  that they might be  able to visit their homes in       New Zealand cannot under existing circumstances  be given effect to.&quot;   The Governor-General, in forwarding this resolution, adds that  Ministers loyallyaccept  the judgment  of the Army Council, and have  informed the General OfficerCommanding  the New  Zealand Forces accordingly.   The disappointment to thetroops themselves and  to the people of  New Zealand will be great, but will be bornewith fortitude.                               SOUTH AFRICA.   At  the  meeting  of  the  South African  Party Congress at Pretoria, the PrimeMinister (General Botha) delivered an address in which he emphasised the fact thatthe war had been forced upon the Allies and that the only thing to do now was tofight to a finish.  An-inconclusive peace, he stated, would only mean another and perhaps greater war in the future, which would  constitute  a serious menace to SouthAfrica, and he therefore declared that the peace must be &quot; one which will be beneficial&quot; to the whole world and will enable every  country to shape its future on a sound*&apos; basis.&quot;  With  reference to the Republican propaganda of the Nationalist Party, the
Premier said that the members of this Party were  not  in  earnest and only wished to gain  a  few votes.   He repeated his previous declaration that the people in SouthAfrica lived under a Constitution  which granted  every kind of  liberty.   As to therumours of a Coalition with the Unionist Party, General  Botha, in giving a denial,stated that it would be dangerous  to  swop horses in  the middle of a fast-runningstream and to go in for new ventures when  the  main object should be to see  the warbrought  to a successful issue.    At the first  meeting of the South  African  Party Congress, the Minister for Agri-culture  (Mr. van Heerden) discussed the industrial situation  and congratulated thecountry  on  its   great   progress  and  unprecedented  prosperity,  notwithstanding the war.   A discussion  took  place  at  the Congress  upon  the question of reunion with the nationalists, and  a Resolution was  passed expressing willingness  to secure a better understanding on the basis of maintaining the  Union Constitution, and carrying outthe obligations connected with it, and also of recognising the principles of the SouthAfrican  Party.  A  Resolution was, however,  unanimously  passed emphatically re-pudiating the propaganda in favour of Republicanism and  endorsing Mr. Merriman&apos;santi-Republican  Resolution, which was passed by the House of Assembly during thelast session of Parliament.   A. further Resolution, unanimously passed&apos; hy the Congress of the  South  AfricanParty, thanked  General Smuts  for his  services and expressed  a hope for his  safereturn.   Another Resolution,  which was carried unanimously, gave  support  to  thepolicy of settling returned soldiers on the land.   His Majesty&apos;s Government have informed  the Portuguese Government  that they agree with their  proposal that Maritz and his companions should be kept in Portugal,and consider it most undesirable that permission to go  to Holland shoidd be given toany of these men.                                  RHODESIA.   At  a large  and representative meeting held at Bulawayo on 29th September insupport  of the movement&quot;&quot;for responsible  Government,  a  Resolution  was  carriedunanimously stating that a continuance  of the present form of Government, by whichthe administrative authority is vested in the Chartered Company, is opposed  to thebest interests  of Southern  Rhodesia.   The  meeting  further unanimously declareditself in favour of approaching the British Government with the object of obtainingresponsible Government, in terms  supplemental to the Company&apos;s Charter, immediatelyafter the war.                                WEST  INDIES.   The British Ambassador in Washington has suggested that, in view  of the foodeconomy campaign in the United States in the interests of  the  Allies,  the  existingpreference granted to Canadian  flour against  United States  flour in  British Guiana.Trinidad, Grenada,  Dominica, St. Lucia, St. Kitts, Barbados, and Antigua shoidd  be suspended during the war.4073-1
PART  II.-FOREIGN  AFFAIRS.                                  FRANCE.   Bolo Pasha has been arrested  as  being implicated in a pacifist plot arranged bythe ex-Khedive of Egypt, the former German Secretary of  State for Foreign Affairs,a former German Ambassador in. Rome, and Sadik Pasha  for  the corruption of theFrench Press.   The  scheme was  to  be  financed  by German money.  Meanwhile,M. Bonnefous has  asserted  in  the Chamber that M. Malvy admitted  to the RadicalSocialist group that he had made a monthly subvention of 8,000 francs  to confirm thewavering patriotism of the late M. Almereyda, of &quot; Le Bonnet Rouge.&quot;   Sadik Pasha,from. Geneva, protests that in all his dealings wdth Bolo  he was only the agent of theex-Khedive, to whom Bolo had promised restoration and revenge in Cairo.   Lord Bertie learns that documents implicating M. Caillaux with the  Bolo intrigueshave  been seized.   They are said to establish his connexion  with Bolo&apos;s Italian agentCavallini, and Lord Bertie understands that the Government which has found its positionstrengthened by the recent arrests  and won the applause of &quot; Ldntransigeant,&quot; intends to sift the scandals of this &quot;  affaire&quot; without consideration of persons.   The &quot; Matin &quot; states that Bolo  at one time  entertained the late Marchese DeliaChiesa, the  brother of Pope  Benedict XV.,  at his villa  at  Biarritz (vide  Italy).According to another Press  report the &quot; Affaire Bolo &quot; appears; to be connected withthe &quot;  Affaire  Tunnel,&quot;  which in turn is thought to be a part of the &quot; Affaire clu BonnetRouge.&quot;  In any case the defence of Bolo has been entrusted to Turmebs advocate. -  Sir H. Rumbold has ascertained that the proceedings of  the Secret  Session of theFrench Chamber are given away by the Kienthal Socialist fraction who  met after eachsession, and. drew up a proces verbal which.they sent to a certain Guilbeaux in Genevawho forwards it to Germany.   At the meeting of  the  Socialist Federation of the Seine held  on 30th SeptemberM. Thomas  was loudly applauded When  he urged all  Socialists  to aid  NationalDefence  by  military  and. diplomatic action.  The Majority Socialists carried theirresolution in favour of voting for war credits in Parliament  by 5,005 votes  to 2,867,and will send  22  delegates to  the Socialist Congress at  Bordeaux  next Saturday(fUh  October), while the two groups  of the Minority will send 2d delegates betweenthem.   According to the report  of the Intelligence Bureau, on France for  27th  September,observers  in touch, with the French working classes report that they are in  no way anxious  to stop the war but in  general agree wdth M. Thomas in demanding amore  vigorous  prosecution,  of  the war as tending to  establish labour in a morefavourable position for enforcing its demands than could  readily be attained in  timeof peace.   Lord Bertie understands that the question of the Parliamentary control of the armieshas been shelved for  the present owing to General PetahPs opposition, although thePress still devotes space to the discussion of the proposals.   Lord  Bertie learns that the French Government desire to be represented on  theUnited  States Shipping  Board and hope  that the British. Government  will make suggestions  in this sense in  Washington.   The French Government, having learned from  M. Tardieu that Lord Reading was proposing to make use of  certain private agreements  between Great Britain  andFrance  in his  American negotiations,1 point out  that they have  not been advisedofficially of  his intention to do so  or even, consulted as to  the desirability of such a procedure, and conclude by asking for information as to  the status of Lord Readingwhile employed, as at present, in the  United States.    The Commission  of the French Chamber for Foreign Affairs has  recommendedthat  Wallis Island (in the Pacific, about 400 miles north-east of Suva in Fiji and about200 miles west of Savaii in the Samoa group) should be constituted as a French colony.The Island has been reckoned as a French dependency for many years.    Lord Bertie reports that a serious strike, of which no mention is permitted in thePress, has begun among the operatives at the Renault aviation works.
                                     ITALY.   The ramifications of the Bolo  plot (vide France) have become international in their scope.  The French Secret Service has discovered that Bolo has supplied 20,000,000lire to the Giolittist Party in Italy to be used for pacifist: purposes.  It appears thatthis money has been deftly applied, and while on the one hand the Italian Governmentfind themselves faced, with. Signor Giolitti&apos;s  threat to bring about a pacifist revolutionif they do not make peace, on the other hand they fear that the investigation of Bolo&apos;saffairs may reveal that many prominent Italians have benefited, by Bolo&apos;s distributionof German funds.   In a despatch of 13th September, Sir  R. Rodd gives details as to the manner inwhich the recent ministerial crisis was  solved.  The crisis arose  out of the strongattacks  made upon Signor  Orlando, the Minister  of  the Interior, for &quot;weakness indealing with,  seditious elements, a weakness generally believed to have been  due tothe Socialist leanings of his chef de Cabinet,  Commendatore Corradini, and to the want of energy  of  the Chief of the Secret Police, Commendatore &quot;Vigliani, who  has beensuspected of sympathies with his former patron, Signor Giolitti.   By consenting tothe resignation of  these  two officials, Signor  Orlando  has  given  guarantees that amore vigorous direction will be given to his office in dealing with  the anti-patrioticagitation which is believed  to be  directly supported by the Central Powers, and  has apparently satisfied his colleagues  as to his own  attitude.   This compromise may involve new difficulties when the Chamber meets,  but meanwhile Signor Orlando  willhave had a months grace in which to make  good his professed, intention of exercising.a more vigorous control over the pacifist agitation.   In a despatch of loth  September Sir R, Rodd quoted Baron So.N.N.I..no as sayingthat the previous policy of the Ministry of  the  Interior could,  not  be maintained inview of the fact that the official Socialists, who had  hitherto  avowedly refrained fromsabotage and deliberate interference with the prosecution of the war, had now, with afew  exceptions which included, however,  their leader, Turati openly announced.their intention of using every means to stop the war before the winter.   Sir R. Rodd, in the same despatch, adds that the Turin riots on 1st Septemberwere  evidently more serious  than he had at  first reported.  So far from being merelydue to an accidental shortage of the bread  supply  they were due to  deliberate  and careful  organisation, supported by  funds from  abroad. * Barricades  were skilfullyconstructed,  and parts of  machine  guns had  been abstracted,  from the  F.I.A.T.Works  to be  put  together  outside.  Turin and Florence are, in  fact, the  danger-spots in Italy, more particularly the former, which is full of Italian &quot; Leninists.&quot;Sir R. Rodd, however, still  repeats his  conviction that as long as the grain and  coalsupply can be assured, Italy as a whole will not fail.    Mr. Erskine reports that the liabilities  of the British Government in connectionwith  the purchase of the  orange  crop  in Italy and Sicily have  been reduced &apos; to1,500,0007-, and  the cost of transport.   Great Britain is to take over the surplus ofthe orange crop,  and bear the loss thereon, while the Italian Government undertakes to dispose of the surplus lemons, converting them into citric acid and essential oil, andbear  the  loss  on them.   No oranges or lemons,  or by-products of the same,  are tobe  exported to neutral countries except under consignment or rationing.   In view ofthis arrangement the desirability of denouncing the  Spanish orange  agreement inpart,  so as to avoid the swamping of the orange market, is under consideration.                                    GREECE.    Mr. Crackanthorpe  has been informed that M. Venizelos  proposes to visit Rome,Paris, and London at the  end of this month.    The Foreign Office has advised Mr. Crackanthorpe  of the  official  communication to the French Government of the appointment of  the British Naval Mission to Greece.and the signature of the contract.    M.  Venizelos has  undertaken that no  fresh  agreement  with  France  about   theArsenal at Salamis will be entered into before the arrival of the British Naval Mission(vide Report No. 35, pages 7, 8).    In spite of the  presentation of the  British  proposals for closer co-operation withthe :Greek authorities in conducting the censorship at Syra, the Hellenic Chief Censorin  that  island has endeavoured  to oust  the  British  officers concerned from  the censorship of telegrams.  In conformity with views expressed by the  Foreign Office&apos;
 (vide Report No. 33, page 9), Mr. Crackanthorpe. has pressed for instructions that the Greek official in question should be withdrawn pending the settlement of the question of reorganisation now under consideration.    Mr. Crackanthorpe reports that the regulations respecting the movements of aliens which have hitherto only been  applied  to the Nomarchy of  Attica and Boeotia have been extended  over the  whole kingdom.    Martial  law  was  proclaimed  in the Noniarchies of Arcadia, Laconia, and Larissa as from 21st September, and  in  that of Argolis and Corinthia as from 29th  September.   These additions to the various areas already proclaimed (vide  Reports No. 33, page 9, and  No. 34, page 7) extend  martial law over the whole of the Peloponnese, as well  as the most important  district of Thessaly.    The British Consul at  Janina reports that the Italian occupation of Konitza and the neighbouring villages (vide  Report No.  35, page 8) is being maintained  on the ground that French detachments have  not yet been withdrawn from Izvor and other villages to the east of the Liaskovik-Hersek  line.    The High Commissioner for Egypt is prepared to advise the Egyptian Government to recognise as of Hellenic nationality any person who recently enrolled himself as a Venizelist adherent (under the proclamation of  the commander-in-Chief  in  Egypt) who now  volunteers for  the Greek Army.   This  would facilitate  the recruiting for the Greek Army in Egypt, where regular  Hellenic  subjects  are  being called  up formilitary service  in the ordinary way  by the Greek Government.    The High Commissioner for Egypt has advised the Foreign Office that no part ofthe new crop of cotton seed can be promised to Greece.                                   SERBIA.    In answer to the objections raised by the  Italian  Government against the return of  Southern Slav prisoners in their hands for service with the Serbian Army, the Foreign Office points to the fact  that the Italians themselves have endeavoured  to secure  for  their forces the services  of Italian-speaking Austrian  and Hungarian subjects who were  prisoners of war in Russia, and to the existence of a considerable volunteer force of Southern Slavs on the  Roumanian front, and has instructed Sir R.  Rocld to continue  pressing the Italian Government to accede  to the request made by  the Serbian Government (vide Report No. 33, page 8), that southern Slav prisoners in Italian hands might be sent  to  Salonika  to join the  Serbian Army there  and be employed for reaping.  Mr. Erskine, however, found  that  the  Italian  Minister for Foreign Affairs, while prepared  to release individual  prisoners,  even in hundreds, could  not consider the question of wholesale release, as in  the first place it would cause the enemy to send Italian prisoners to work in Turkey, and  in the second place because these Southern Slavs were the most bitter enemies of Italy.   He feared that  they would carry on anti-Italian propaganda  in the Serbian  Army, and  might even be used  eventually against  Italy.  Mr.  Erskine  remarks  upon the bitterness   of the Foreign  MiuisteFs language with regard to  the  Southern Slav  agitation, which  is inimical to Italian ambitions in Dalmatia.    Sir G. Buchanan reports that the  Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs has agreed that the  credit  of 2,000,000  francs&quot;  for reconstruction  should  be shared  equally between Great Britain and France as an  advance to the charge of Russia against the joint loans to Serbia.    Sir  C. des Graz understands that the  present  visit  of M.  Pashitch and other Serbian  Ministers  to  Salonika is in connection wdth the proposed removal  of the-remainder of the Serbian  Government from Corfu to Macedonia.                                   GERMANY.    The suppression of &quot; Germania &quot; (vide Report No. 35, p. 9) for giving too muchprominence to the views of  Herr Erzberger  is expected to give rise to recriminationsin the Reichstag, for it is in defiance of the resolution of the Main Committee passed in August to the effect that  the discussion of peace aims  should not be  subject tocensorship, and that  newspapers should only be  suspended if their action directlyimperilled military operations.   Further, such suspension was  to be approved by theChancellor.   In this  case  Dr.  Michaelis wdll doubtless  overcome  the  difficulty, but
from  the point  of view of the  Majority Group he  has become more  open to the suspicion of being the partisan of  the Pan-Germans.  In point of fact, Dr. Michaelisis only a figurehead put up to shelter Plerr von Kuhlmann, much in the same way thatPrince Lichnowski was imported from Germany to act as an Ambassadorial  mask tothe activities  of von Kuhlmann  when  the  latter was  his nominal  subordinate  inLondon.  The way  in which  the Secretary of State  for Foreign Affairs is  causinghimself to be boomed in the German Press leaves little room for doubt as to  his realposition behind the Chancellor.  Meanwhile  the German  Patriotic Party (vide ReportsNo. 34, p. 8, No. 35, p. 9) is asserting itself, and Grand Admiral von Tirpitz as  itschief  appeals for  contributions to the War Loan which is to  bring about the  over-whelming victory of Germany.   The  Pan-Germans are leaving to the  Centre Party the duty of attacking theErzberger propaganda, and GO members  of that body have issued a  declarationdeploring the discouragement and division produced  among  the  public  by his speeches, and reasserting  the necessity for a  peace  which is to  guarantee thepolitical security and economic development of Germany.                             AUSTRIAN AFFAIRS.   In a recent despatch Sir PL Rumbold, in referring to the peace intrigues emanating from  the Austrian  Court and carried  on  through  various clerical channels  inSwitzerland, draws special attention to the position of Prince Furstenburg, who, whileclosely connected with the Austrian  Court, and  holding all the strings of German-speaking  clericalism in  Austria in  his  hands,  through  his control  of clericalnewspapers and social and educational, organisations, is  also so  intimately associatedwith the German Emperor  as  to be  known  as  the emperor&apos;s spy at  the  Hofburg.Prince  Furstenburg enjoys  the peculiar  position/of being a member both of the prussian and  Austrian  Upper blouses.   Sir  H.  Rumbold  points  out  that  it is improbable that any Austrian manoeuvres for a separate peace could be concealed fromGermany.  If  they  are  winked at it is,  he  suggests,  to leave  the  door open forconversations.   If these lead up to a peace without victory the blame could all themore easily be  thrown upon Austria.   Sir  R. Rodd, in  a despatch of 14th  September, summarises a conversation withM. Gryparis,  the late Greek Minister in Vienna.   M. Gryparis considers the economicsituation in Austria to be very bad, but not critical enough to preclude -resistance forsome time to come.  The new Emperor  is  convinced  of the absolute necessity ofpeace, and genuinely anxious  to emancipate himself from German influence.   CountCzernin is in  agreement with  him on  these  points,  but how to secure liberationfrom Germany, whose domination alone holds  the shaky Austrian fabric together,  isan insoluble problem.  Failing its solution, the new emperor&apos;s efforts are concentrated on pressing Germany to accept peace.                                SWITZERLAND.    Sir C. Spring Rice learns that the Swiss Minister in Washington has  protested against some of the terms of the Draft Agreement  embodying the conditions imposedupon the supply of various  commodities from the United States.   It is stipulated that if Switzerland obtain any of the articles named from elsewhere the amount soimported will be reckoned in reduction of the ration granted by the Exports Board.   Ageneral condition prevents the Swiss from re-exporting any article imported under theAgreement to an enemy or northern neutral country either  directly or as a componentpart of any other form of  goods.  Grain  and fodders imported, are not to operate to release similar articles of  Swiss  origin to the above-named destinations ;  the importa-tion of maize, oats and barley is to stop the export  of preserved meats, and that of oil cake  and  oil. seed meal to  depend upon  the contract supply of  tinned  milk to theFrench and British Armies.  No imported mineral oil, machines, forgings or machineparts are to be used in any factory working for export to enemy or neutral countries.Leather  and  cotton  imports  will close-down exports  as above of leather  or rubberboots and shoes, saddles, hides, and  tanned leather, as well as  cotton  goods of all;-sorts, or in  which  cotton is used.  Facilities are  to be  given for United States     4073 -1                              C
                                NETHERLANDS.    The  Dutch Mission  in the  United States has proposed to the Exports  Board a   comprehensive  division  of  Dutch  ships and  cargoes in  United States  ports between Holland and the Belgian Relief Service,   Sir G. Spring Rice has  urged that the United States Government should remember the main question  of the conditions. on which Holland is to  be allowed  to get grain and feeding stuffs and not  allow themselves  to be led away into some partial agreement as was  done in the case  of Norway (vide Report No. 35, p.  12).  At present the Exports Board incline to fix the amount of bread stuffs required by Holland  at 300,000 tons, that of oils  and fats at 40,000 tons, while no feeding stuffs will be needed if  the number of cattle  is  to be reduced, and  the Ambassador  points  out that  the unwillingness  of the Board  to increase this ration is not in accordance with the recommendations of Sir W. Townley.    An authoritative communique,  issued apparently by the German Legation at The Hague  to the Dutch  Press,  states that as Germany can  only  supply 250,000 tons of coal  per month, an inadequate amount for the  needs of Holland, no special  efforts will be made to prevent the arrival of coal from Great Britain, but before free passage can be guaranteed for British coal an agreement covering the supply of German coal must. be entered into, as  Germany cannot admit that the Netherlands should first  secure a British  supply and thus need German coal less urgently when they come to bargaining wdth Germany.    The British Government has decided that  the  Navy is not  to  provide  convoy for the Dutch ships engaged in the coal trade to Holland.    Sir W. Towhiey  reports that the Netherlands Oversea  Trust has agreed not  to allow any exports to Scandinavia.    A British Order  in Council of 29th September prohibits, as from 8th  October,. all exports  to Holland  except printed matter and personal effects accompanied bytheir owner.  The Order applies to the parcels post, but it is possible that applicationsfor licences to export goods hitherto free but now  prohibited may be considered fora short time.                                    SWEDEN.    Professor Eden, the Leader of  the Liberal Party, and  Mr. Brauting, the Leader ofthe Socialist  Party in the new Chamber, were  received  in  audience by the King  of sweden on  28th September, and  the Conservative Administration resigned on  1stOctober.  The King of  Sweden sent for two leaders of  each of the three main parties.in the new Chamber (vide Report No. 35, p. 1.1) and invited them to form, a CoalitionMinistry and to report to him on his return from the manoauvres on 7th October.    Mr.  Branting is  of  the  opinion that  a Liberal-Socialist Coalition will be formedunder Professor Eden, the Leader nf  the Liberal Party, and according to  information furnished to  the British Minister by a leading Socialist the Liberal  Socialist Coalitionhas agreed upon  a  common programme  and four Socialists will enter the Cabinet.Sir E. Howard reports  that there is a possibility that Mr. Branting may join this new cabinet as Minister of the Interior, while Mr. Hellner is spoken of as Foreign Minister.Mr. Branting is willing  to take office if his presence in the Cabinet would  cause theAllied  Governments to have greater  confidence in the new Coalition  than in  theexisting Conservative Administration, and, while personal assurances have  been givento  this  effect,  Sir  E.  Howard  has  caused a warning to  be communicated  to  theSocialist Leader that the present blockade policy cannot  be altered.  Baron Palmstierna,.a. Socialist  leader, in representing the difficulties  of  Mr. Branting&apos;s  position if. theAllies refused to grant  any accommodation to Sweden, was informed that the remedylay with Sweden  herself ; other neutrals had  entered  into shipping agreements, andeven in the  matter of  the export of iron ore  the difficulties dreaded by Mr. Brantingmight not prove insuperable.    According to a Press report  a Swedish regiment  stationed at Vesteras rioted on28th September as a protest against short rations.   This ma3r be of importance owing;to the fact that the Swedish Autumn Manoeuvres are impending.representatives to supervise the proper execution of the conditions laid down in  thisAgreement which is to run for a year and a day from 1st October 1917.
   The American  Legation in  Stockholm,  understands that for some time  past30 telegrams daily have been transmitted by the Swedish Government on behalf ofGermany, and that repayment of 1,300,000 kr. (94,500L at  present rates of sterlingexchange) has recently been made on this account.   Owing to the recent revelations as to the action of  the Swedish diplomatic officials in the Argentine and  Mexico with regard to  German  messages, the British Govern-ment has stopped all  Swedish cipher telegrams  over British controlled cables, but sir C. Spring Bice has been instructed to inform  the United  States Government  thatit will  always be  open for them to send  the Swedish messages  from Washingtonthrough the State Department and the American Minister in Stockholm.   Idle State  Department  has asked  that the Swedish diplomatic bags  detained  atHalifax may be forwarded to the British Embassy in Washington, and  is prepared  tohave them opened either  in the Embassy or in the State Department (vide  ReportNo. 35, pages 10-11),  and  to this the Foreign  Office has agreed.   In  a  letter to  Lord Hardinge of  18th September Sir E. Howard  says that thepublication of the transmitted German telegrams  produced a tremendous impressionwdth the  public  and  greatly  shook the  position  of the Government.    ddie  onlyunfortunate feature had been the attitude of the English and. American Press which,in its  insistence  of a change  of  Government in Sweden, had  provoked a strongreaction.  He Jays stress on the intense  pride and obstinacy of the Swedes, who areprepared at the slightest suggestion of outside dictation to mount their high horseand refuse to listen to reason.  This  applies to the whole  nation,  but  Sir E. Howardthinks  that when Sweden is no longer governed  by junkers and courtiers it will  be aArery good country to deal  with and to live in.   The Russian Minister  has informed Sir E. Howard that  only .10,000 tons of oil-cake are  available in  Russia  for export to  Sweden,  and not 30,000  as  was at  firststated (vide Report No. 35, page 11).   With  reference to the invitation to co-operate in  the joint Allied embargo uponexports to Sweden, Mr. Nordman, the  head of the Economic section of  the RussianMinistry  for Foreign Affairs, expressed a fear that such an announcement on the  partof Russia might precipitate Sweden into the arms  of  the Central  Powers,  or at theleast provoke  a suspension of transit facilities for Russian imports through Sweden.While reassured on the former point hy Sir E. Howard, Mr. Nordman explained  thatno more  oil-cake was available for  exportation to  Sweden, and it was suggestedthat  a  pretence   of  exportation might  be kept up,  care, however,  being taken that  no mineral oil or lubricants should be  allowed  to cross the frontier.   Such asolution of the difficulties  envisaged  in the second point might prove acceptable  inLondon where these questions are being discussed between the Allies.   According to Sir E. Howard the Swedish Minister for Agriculture on 25th Septemberdeclared that Sweden  had  only 50 per cent, of the amount of bread-corn, and 40 percent, of that of fodder required for normal,  consumption.  The potato  harvest was good, but in view of the lack of other foodstuffs  there would probably  be a shortageby the  spring.   Sir  E.  Howard reports that he  has had  to refuse permission  to a  SwedishCo-operative  Society to buy rice in transit for Russia, and  indicates  that repeatedattempts  are likely to be made to obtain such goods in Sweden wdiile the existing arrangements remain in force.                                   NORWAY.   The British  Government have instructed Sir M. Findlay to notify  to  the  parties concerned  that all agreements regarding the importation  of grain, flour, maize andother feeding stuffs into Norway have been denounced as from 27th  September.   A British Order in Council of 29th September prohibits, as from 8th October, all exports to Scandinavian countries except printed  matter and personal  effects  accom-panied  by their  owner.  The order applies to the parcels post, but it  is possiblethat  applications for licences to export goods hitherto free but now prohibited may beconsidered for a short time.   Sir M. Findlay announces that a further 8,000  tons of rye have  been granted bythe United States to Norway (vide Report  No. 35, p. 1.2), which appears to raise thetotal of grain and flour shipped or promised to some 77,000 tons, or more than twomonths&apos; rations for Norway.   Sir C. Spring Rice refers to the  difficulty  of guiding
the Exports Board in its negotiations  with  Dr. Nansen, who  lias  been  unofficiallyinformed of the imminence of an American demand for a complete cessation of exportsto Germany.   Sir M. Findlay points out in connection with the suggested cessation of Norwegianexports to Germany  that Sweden  enjoys Treaty rights whereby she can  continue to export Swedish ore  from Norwegian ports even  if similar Norwegian  exports to anenemy  destination, are prohibited.   Further, the Minister is  of  opinion that ifNorway were induced to interfere with Swedish  ore in transit  from Norwegian ports to Germany it would  strengthen the Swedish contention that conditions can  beattached to the Allied transit trade with Russia.   The only method of escape appearsto lie in the possibility that the United States will be able to persiracle Sweden to stopexporting either directly or indirectly to Germany and to export to Holland only such goods as may be consigned to the Netherlands Oversea Trust.                                  PORTUGAL.   The President of the Portuguese Republic has  fixed loth October for his visit tothe British front in France.   Sir L. Carnegie  reports that the proposals respecting the future of the PortugueseAfrican Colonies made by representatives of the British Labour Party at the recentinter-Allied Socialist Conference in London have aroused considerable resentment in portugal where a  Press campaign directed alike  against Great Britain for having made the proposals and the Portuguese Government for not having protested against them is in progress. The Minister for Foreign Affairs suggests that the effects of thisslight to the national amour propre may be mitigated if His Majesty the King were tomeet the Portuguese President during the visit of the latter to the West Front.   (Theproposals in question contemplated the surrender of the tropical African colonies ofall the Powers to an international authority.)                                    SPAIN.   Lord Bertie learns that a certain French journalist, by name Gaston Routier, nowin Spain, is accused of having been furnished with funds by the German naval attache in Madrid for the express purpose  of founding a Germanophil pacifist news-paper to be published in French as &quot; La Paix &quot; and in Spanish as &quot; El Heraldo de la Paz.&quot;This maj- be  connected with the newspaper activities of Bolo Pasha (vide  Franceand Italy).   The British Vice-consul at Laraiche in the Spanish, zone of Morocco reports thata German has been entrusted with examination of the luggage of all persons passing the Customs, and the Foreign  Office has  asked  that the German  may  be employedelsewhere.   The Spanish  Government, in spite of the supplies of coal which  Spain can nowobtain from Great Britain,  approached the American Ambassador in Madrid with viewto getting more from the United States.  Sir A. Hardinge understands, however, thata reply was returned explaining that the supply of American coal would depend uponthe views and prior requirements of the Allies.                                    JAPAN.   Sir C. Greene communicates details of the new Imperial Ordinance establishing aShipping Control (vide Report No. 33, p.  14).  According to this the chartering or saleof Japanese shipping to aliens, or the building of ships for aliens is in future prohibited,but licences may be obtained to legalise existing  agreements  or contracts of this nature.  Japanese ships are forbidden to ply only between foreign ports, and may beexpropriated or requisitioned, together  with their  crews, at the discretion of theMinister of  Communications, who  may also  fix  routes to be followed  and order thetransport of specific persons or cargo.
   Viscount  Ishii,  speaking at a banquet  held  in New York on 29th September, inhonour of the Imperial Japanese Mission  to the United States, defined  the. Japanesepolicy  towards  China  in  order to checkmate  the  machinations of  the  enemy&apos;spropaganda against Japan among the American public,  die laid clown  the principlethat  Japan does not seek territorial  aggrandisement at the expense  of  China forherself and will not  tolerate  such action on the part of other Powers.  This hasbeen hailed as a Japanese &quot;Monroe Doctrine &quot;  for China, but Viscount Ishii pointsout that the Japanese policy is one of sell-denial,  while  the  real Monroe Doctrine isnot qualified  in that way.                                     SIAM.   Mr. Lyle reports that the Siamese Government are anxious  to  adopt a policy of restricting the privilege of&apos; telegraphing in cypher to Allies and  hope that cypherprivileges may be allowed to Siamese  representatives  and attaches in  Europe whentelegraphing  to the Ministry of War in  Bangkok.  This will be necessary in connectionwith the  proposed despatch of an aviation and motor detachment  to  the  western front.   In  spite  of  her  Treaty obligations  the Siamese  Government are  prepared toconsider the  question of imposing an embargo on the export of rice on the  groundthat it may be constituted contraband,  and have asked  to be  supplied with the  texts of the embargoes issued by the United States and Great Britain.                                 ARGENTINA.-   Both Sir P. Tower and the French Minister in Buenos Aires are of the opinionthat  President Irigoyen is supported in his attitude of  maintaining neutrality inspite  of the  strong  advice of the Argentine Congress  by Roman - Catholic clericalinfluence.   The Foreign Office has proposed to the United States  that an offer should be madeto the Argentine Government to  purchase at an early date the surplus of the Argentinecrop for a  fair price, in return  for which facilities would be given for  the supply ofcoal  required by the Argentine,  ft is  pointed out that  delay is dangerous, and  thatif the necessity were explained which compels the Allies to draw their own grain fromnearer sources, and leave the most distant sources for the neutrals, there would be noopening for German  propaganda in the Argentine or any injury to  that country.   Thedelay is  caused owing to the  fact  that the United  States are  relying upon theestablishment of  a bunker control, which would divert  cargoes from  the Argentineto United States ports, as a means of solving  the present  difficulty.  At the same timethe British Government are now ready to act  under the declaration of April 1916, andremove German coal from ships  trading  to the Argentine if  the United. States cannot agree to the milder course proposed by Great Britain.   The United States authorities are unwilling to purchase the whole of  the  surplusfodder-cereals  as  owing to tonnage  difficulties  the  whole  surplus  could;  not be transported to the Northern  neutrals,  but  agree that  the Argentine Governmentshould be  informed that the  purchase of the surplus  crops is under consideration,and suggest that in view of the  political  situation in the  Argentine it would be better not to restrict jute or coal imports into the Republic at present.   In view of the proposed imposition  of  export duties,  Sir R.  Tower  has been instructed to inform  the Argentine Government that as the proposed duties will causean extra expense of 50O,00OL to the  British  Government on their purchases of hidesand  quebracho alone, every effort wdll  be made to divert British orders for these commodities elsewdtere.                                   URUGUAY.   Air. Mitchell Times has been informed by the  Minister for Foreign  Affairs  thatUruguay wdll repeal her neutrality regulations when Great Britain, France, and Italyagree to sign the Arbitration treaties, and that no move wdll be made until then.  Much     4073-1                              D
of the delay is caused by the Italian opinion that the expression  &quot; denial of justice &quot;must be interpreted in accordance with Italian legal practice, in which the meaningis so narrow and technical that it would be impossible  for interested  parties&apos; ever tohave recourse to arbitration.   (Vide Report No. 33,  p. 16).   It is suggested that  this difficulty may be overcome by exchanging notes to the effect that the term is  to beused in accordance with its meaning in International, and not Italian,  law.    As the British Minister is  afraid that the favourable moment for securing a rupturebetween  Uruguay and Germany may shortly pass if action  be not  taken,  he isendeavouring to persuade the Government to accept the signature of  the arbitration treaty  by Great  Britain  and  France as  a sufficient  fulfilment of  the requiredconditions.    ddie Foreign Office, however, is pressing  both  France and  Italy to come  to anagreement on the subject of  the  Arbitration Treaty, and has enumerated  the verbalalterations which must be effected in the present  draft to make the ddeaty  acceptable to Great,Britain.   Further, it  is suggested that the joint negotiations on behalf of thethree Allies should  be confided to the French Minister, as being the senior, and  thathe should be instructed to warn the Uruguayan Government that a definite  agreement as to the number of the ex-enemy ships to be handed over to the  Allies must be madeas an indispensable preliminary to the signature of the Arbitration Treaty.                                  COLOMBIA.    Mr. Wyndham reports that a motion condemning the German submarine  campaign,as far as is consistent with the maintenance of strict neutrality,  has been introduced into the Colombian Senate in  Bogota by General Idolguin.                                 COSTA RICA.    ddie Foreign Office has  agreed to grant a safe conduct,  valid for two  months, tothe German  Charge d&apos;Altai res at  San Jose, and the German  Consular Officers decarriere with their families,  ddie party must  proceed  together direct to some neutral country contiguous with Germany, and are liable  to be searched  as required.                                 NICARAGUA.    Mr. Young  reports that the replies of the Central  American  Republics to theproposals  of Honduras for the restoration of  the  Union of Central America betray no great enthusiasm  for  the  idea.  Nicaragua  suggests  that  Washington or  Panamashould be the scene of the discussions, and that  the Republic of Panama  be invitedto take rank as a Central American Republic.  Guatemala suggests that the existingDelegates to the Central American Bureau in Guatemala  should  be entrusted  with thearrangement of preliminaries.  San Salvador  proposes that  the discussions should be under the auspices of  the   United  States,  Mexico,  and  certain South  american republics.  Costa Rica  has   not replied, and as Washington has not yet recognisedPresident  Tinoco of that State, and  has, moreover,  intimated that  Central Americanrecognition of his position would be regarded wdth disfavour,  the negotiations willprobably be delayed.                                   MEXICO.    The Belgian Charge d&apos;Affaires on 28th September recognised  General Carranzaon behalf of his Government  as President of Mexico.    Mr. Cummins reports the outbreak   of  another  strike at  the  Mexican  EagleCompany&apos;s works at Tampico.  Other oil companies are  affected.                                     CUBA.    Mr. Leech reports that  one Paul Burger, a former clerk  in  the German Legationin Havana, has been arrested.  He has been employed by the Spanish Minister whois in charge of  German interests in Cuba, and is accused  of having issued  Spanishpassports to Germans which have enabled them to go to the United States and Mexico.
                                     PERU.   On 25th September the Peruvian Minister in Berlin was  instructed to demand asatisfactory reply to his previous representations on the subject of the &quot; Lorton &quot; casewithin eight clays, failing which the Peruvian  Republic will  break  off diplomatic relations with Germany.   Mr. Rennie learns  that the  German Minister in Lima came to an understanding with  the  late Peruvian  Minister for Foreign Affairs, in virtue of which Germanyacquired an important position with regard to the Peruvian oil-fields, and offered toprovide the capital  required for the  expropriation of existing oil interests in Peru,while the Republic agreed to grant no fresh oil concessions during the war.                              UNITED  STATES.   In accordance with orders  issued  by the War Office, all  members of the MilitaryForces of  the Crown in the United States must report their  arrival to the  military attache, wear uniform on all  occasions, and  produce their passports at  any time  on demand.   Lord Reading,  who  is  much impressed  by the lack  of co-ordination  between government  Departments  in  Washington proposes to visit New  York in  order toconfer with-Colonel House.  The Counsellor  of the  State  Department  has called  on lord Reading to discuss  this  question of  co-ordination which in his opinion  is one of pressing urgency.   At  present  there is no  control except  in the hands of thePresident.   Sir C.  Spring Rice  believes there is some  anxiety as  to whether the  total amountof the new issue of Bonds wall be taken  up,  and  the Secretary of the Treasury isundertaking a three weeks&apos; campaign  in order to popidarise the loan.   The Foreign Office has informed the States Department unofficially that the ChineseLabour Corps  employed  by the British Government in France  has proved  an unqualified success, but points out that if the United States cannot find adequate reserves of labour in America,  and wish  also  to  employ  Chinese  coolies,  some arrangement between the two  Governments as to recruiting areas and equality of paywill be necessary.   The following extracts from a letter  dated 7th September,  from Sir  C. SpringRice to Mr. Balfour, are of interest:    &quot; The indications are that the President is absolutely determined to  carry on  the war, but  he  is also  absolutely  determined  to  maintain  his full  and complete independence.  . He retains his original idea, -when he thought of being mediator, even now that he is a belligerent.   He is not a belligerent among other belligerents, butsomething apart.  It does not mean that he will not give  every possible  help, and make every possible sacrifice,  but he will not be bound by any sort of agreement, norwill he incur  even the possibility of being supposed to have an  agreement.  Both tothe Committee of tire Senate and M. Bouillon he expressed himself very positively asto his intention to go on with what he had begun.  But he impressed on  both of themthat he was not bound  to any particular course of action.  Lie has clearly before him the ideal of a reformed Germany, over whom there will be more joy than over ninety-nine just nations.   With  this Germany no  measures of  reprisal or repression  oreven  of  defence   wdll  be necessary.   With no  other   Germany will  he  treat.           Rumours are  current, chiefly  among the  extreme Republicans, that thePresident, although anxious to make  the weight of the United States felt in the war,is bent on peace, and  there  are indications in certain quarters of the Press, althoughprobably these are without official inspiration,  that an idea prevails  that the president should use the power which he now  possesses over the Allies to force them to accept any terms acceptable to himself and to Germany.   It would  no doubt be an immenseadvantage  to  this Administration  to  bring the war to an end, if this could be done with any appearance of success. The Democratic Party is liable to the accusation thatthe President obtained his power by saying that he had kept the country out of war,and  used it  by bringing the country into war.   It would relieve them from thisaccusation if  the President could also  bring them out of the war.  Germany, however,at least official Germany,  has shown no tendency whatever  to offer the President a    4073-1                               E
helping hand.  There are the usual  professions and promises  of  an unofficial kind.-But I think you ought to hear in mind that if  the President could  be convinced thathis ideals are secured and  his mind  is satisfied with any proposal  made  to him hewould undoubtedly insist on the Allies accepting it without  consulting them before-hand.   The movements of his  mind are mysterious and rapid.  He does nut hearanybody or consult them, and nobody knows beforehand what his decisions are likelyto be  ... .  One of the  reasons why the President  objects  to  having responsibleagents abroad to keep him informed of military and naval and other matters is thathe has a rooted distrust  of military and naval advisers, and that he has had  an extremely disagreeable experience with various special  commissioners.   House turnsout  to  be  the only one that he can really trust to, and I suspect that, he gets all  his information of an  unofficial character through House as General Intelligence officer and  editor of news.   House is absolutely unselfish and quite  devoted to the President.He has no political aim of his own, he is endlessly patient as  a listener, and very clearas an informant.   The President trusts him to give him what he hears without anycolour of personal interest.  But the strain on House, who is almost without assistance,is becoming intolerable, and I don&apos;t know how long the present system will be ableto last.  You ought, however, to  know  one  of the reasons why the President was reluctant  to accede to  our perfectly natural wishes that he  should have  a  directrepresentative on the Allied Council.&quot;                            SHIPPING  SITUATION.   Sir  A.  Peel learns that the  Brazilian  Government have decided not to sell orcharter any of the  ex-German ships, which are to sail under the Brazilian flag, and donot wish to enter into separate negotiations with any one of the Allies, but are willingto place them at the disposal of aLt the Allies -who will prescribe the courses to be  setafter mutual discussion   The question of British  recognition  of  this  transfer of German shipping to  the brazilian flag has now again been raised in  connection with the sailing  of the  ex-&apos;&apos; Gertrude Wizenmann &quot; from Rio, bound for New York.   Idie Chilean Government propose to purchase the German ships  now  lying inChilean harbours,  and hope that the British Government  will  raise no objection, asthe ships are to be used for the transport of Chilean grain to  Europe.   Mr. Rennie reports that all ex-German ships in Caliao and Mollendo now occupiedby the Peruvian Authorities have been seriously damaged.   The Portuguese Government have informed SirL. Carnegie that they are preparedto use  half the ex-enemy tonnage not  yet handed over  to Great Britain in  trade between British or French and  Portuguese ports,  but the ships must remain in  the possession of the Portuguese Government.  While Portugal cannot hand over four ofthese vessels to Great Britain, as was at one time thought possible, owing  to populardisapproval of the suggestion the  Government is willing to  charter to Great Britainany  of them which may not be  required for  the  Portuguese trade.  (Vide ReportNo. 35, p. 15.)   Sir  C. Greene reports that five steamers are being built in  Japan for the FrenchGovernment.   (Vide Report No. 35, p. 15.)   In connection with these shipbuilding activities, the Japanese  Government  have proposed that the United States  should license the export of 450,000 tons of  materialbefore the end of 1918 in return for the transfer of 600,000 tons of existing shippingbefore the end of September 1919.   Sir C.  Spring Rice is of opinion that these termswill not prove acceptable in Washington, as  he understands that the  United  StatesExports Board is anxious rather to purchase than to charter Japanese tonnage, and isnot interested in deliveries of shipping made after July  1918.    Sir M. Fiiidlay  suggests that a number of Norwegian ships newly built in Hollandunder engagement not to carry cargoes for the Allies might profitably be employed incarrying coal  from Great Britain to Holland under the  new arrangement with thatcountry.  This would release Dutch ships for  ordinary trade.   In view of the urgency of the need for guns with which  to  arm  merchantmen,the British Government  have invited the principal maritime Allied States to supply4-inch  and 0-inch guns removed from old ships or modern  warships laid up  forlong refit.   According to the War Trade  Intelligence Report, the total tonnage of 500  tonsgross in the case of steamers, and  100 tons gross in the  case of sailing ships,  reported
lost owing to the malice of the  King&apos;s enemies  during the period 21st. September-27th  September  inclusive,  is  5-1,310 tons, of which 28,298 tons were  British,  ascompared wdth. 81,914- tons, of which 56,628 tons were British, reported last week.   Lord Northcliffe has drawn attention in the American Press to the official statement made by Sir Joseph Maclay to the effect that &quot; unless the United States faces  the&quot; shipping problem and  constructs 6,000,000 tons of  shipping annually, the military&quot; efforts of the United States will be crippled from the start/&apos;                            PEACE  DISCUSSIONS.   Sir W.  Town-ley understands that  the Austrian Government  is displeased withthose paragraphs  in the Bulgarian reply to the Papal Note wdiich  emphasise thenational unity of the Bulgarian people,  and  that  the AustroJJungarian Minister hasbeen summoned from Sofia to give explanations.   With reference to the alleged special Peace terms for Belgium (vide Report No. 35,p. 17), a &quot;Wolff &quot; telegram to a Dutch newspaper denies  that  such proposals wereever made  to the Papal  Nuncio  in  Munich.    This may  be taken as a  Germanofficial denial of the report.   Sir W.  Townley draws attention to  German Press reports and privately expressedopinions to the effect that the King of the  Belgians has lately made repeated efforts tohurry on. the opening of peace  negotiations, and  to embark  on pourparlers  on thissubject wdth the Prussian Hohenzollerns through  Madrid..   Count Czernin, speaking at a banquet in his  honour at Budapest, is reported inthe Dutch Press as having favoured a scheme for obligatory international arbitration and. general disarmament on land, coupled with the freedom of the high seas, but not of the  narrow seas.   In these circumstances,  if the enemy completely evacuatesAustro-Hungarian  territory, the Dual Monarchy will be prepared  to  forego any territorial aggrandisement.   Sir Id. Rumbokl describes the highly interesting views  upon the Pan-German ideafor an ultimate settlement furnished by Professor Jaffe, editor of journals and  authorof books dealing with Political Economy,  and described as &quot; one of Helfferich&apos;s right-hand men.&quot;  It will be noticed that these do not tally at  all with those  put forward by the Austro-Hungarian Minister for Foreign Affairs.   Germany will decline to give  up Alsace-Lorraine, which is shortly to be erectedinto a Federal State of the  Empire under a Roman Catholic Prince of the House ofWurttemberg, but a readjustment of the  frontier  near, and including, Metz might bemade in return for central African compensation.    Germany will recognise Poland as  independent, but will not cede her own Polishprovinces.   An independent Lithuania will be erected comprising Courland and Riga,wdiich is to be a Free Port,  in order to allow the new Poland to have access to it.   France  and Belgium,  will-be evacuated, but  Belgium is only to get 150,000,OOOZ.in compensation for  damage  done, of which Great Britain is to pay  half.   Further,Belgium must have no standing army, and must dismantle all  fortifications  on  theGerman frontier.    In Africa  Germany recognises  the finality of the loss of German South-West Africa,for which compensation  must be  found   elsewhere, but opinion is divided as to thedisposal of the rest of the  Continent.   Some want all Central Africa others prefer a concentration on the  Atlantic Coast, leaving the East Coast to Great Britain.    Austria-Hungary  is understood to be willing to surrender the Trentino and  Triesteprovided the latter be made a free port if in exchange Serbia and Rumania enter the monarchy.   In that case  a Southern Slav State would  be  formed uniting  Serbia,Montenegro, Dalmatia,  and Croatia, and Transylvania wrould be added to Rumania,but both these enlarged kingdoms would be  subordinate  members of the HapsburgEmpire.    The Central Empires, if their wishes are met  in this way, are prepared to abandonTurkey and join  hands with Great Britain and  France  in the development  of thatcountry while agreeing to the internationalisation of the Straits.    Professor Jaffe thinks any policy of refusal to treat wdth the Uohenzollerns wouldirritate  and estrange many Germans  otherwise  disposed to consider peace on these terms, and suggests  that  if the Imperial  Chancellor were  made  responsible to  theReichstag the Imperial wings would thereby be adequately clipped.
   Sir H. Rumbold understands that the Syndicalist International Peace Congress inBerne (vide Report No. 36, p. 17), is being attended by Austrian, Bulgarian, Germanand Hungarian delegates, and by Italian representatives from local workmen&apos;s clubs.While it is reported in the Press that the French Government will not issue passportsfor French delegates, Sir H. Rumbold is informed that perhaps two representatives ofthe Confederation  Generale du Travail  who are strongly opposed to pacifism andZirnmerwaldism have been deputed to attend.   The Swiss  Delegates  are supposed tobe anxious to restrict the  discussions strictly to  the  motion  for  transferring  theCentral Secretariat of the organisation from Berlin to Berne or The Plague.                                   GENERAL.    The Porte appears  to be  basing its action in threatening  to intern all Britishsubjects in Turkey on a letter from Ayoub  Sabri complaining of ill-treatment at thehands of the British  authorities.   The Foreign Office  declares this letter  to  be  acase either  of forgery  or perjury, as its  supposed writer  has denied on  oath allknowledge of it, and has requested the Netherlands Minister in Constantinople again to press for a general exchange of British and French civilians in Turkey for Ottomancivilians in Great Britain and France.    Proposals have also been  made&apos; to the Porte, through the good  offices of theNetherlands Government  and Minister at  Constantinople, for a mutual exchange  ofBritish and Turkish invalid prisoners of war.    The Hellenic Government  having been  notified by the Porte  that four GreekConsular Officers were  being detained in  Turkey pending  the release of SuleimanBey,  a  former  Ottoman  Consular  Officer, now in Egypt,  the Foreign Office has informed the Swedish Charge cFAffaires that the Egyptian Government will repatriatehim.    Sir W. Townley has been instructed to intimate to the Dutch Government that  if250 British civilians interned in Germany be sent to England in the &quot; Sindoro &quot; andother steamers now ready 1,050 German civilians interned in this country will be sent.back on the  return voyage.  All the civilians referred to are over 45  years of age.    The Foreign Office draws the attention of Sir G. Buchanan  to the curious reports as to the existence of an  Austro-Russian Agreement for the exchange of prisonerswhich has already been denied by the Petrograd Government  (vide Report No. 33,pp. 20-21).   The British Minister  in Berne learns that Mr. Kerensky  has expressed himself in writing as being much in favour of such  an exchange, and the BureauUkrainien has published details of the alleged Agreement.    Sir W. Townley draws attention to the astonishing mendacity of a Dutch travellerin England who has telegraphed from Rotterdam to a German newspaper  a  detaileddescription  of the partial destruction of the Tower of London,  the Bank of England,Westminster Bridge, and.  the Houses of  Parliament, by  aeroplane bombs  and theindescribable panic which accompanied these incidents, and suggests the advisability of restricting the travelling facilities of so-called neutrals.
