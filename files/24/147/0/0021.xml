SECRET,APPRECIATION  OF  THE  ATTACHED  WESTERN  AND GENERAL                           REPORT,  No.  46.                                    CANADA.   Tin; comments of the-Minister  of Customs  upon the relationship of  Quebec  tothe Western  Provinces, and  the  reapportionment  of  constituencies  necessitated by increased Western population, are  interesting as showing that  the  tendency of thefuture will be to diminish the influence of a &quot;solid Quebec.&quot;                           AUSTRALIAN  COMMONWEALTH.   Mr. Hughes&apos; striking references  to the stake of the Commonwealth  in  the war should make  clear  to the Australian people  the true meaning of a  German victoiyboth to them and to the future of the Pacific.                                  SOUTH. AKKRA.   ddie fact  that General Podia should have considered it well to issue a furthergrave warning regarding the racial question, and  to emphasise  that the principles ofthe South  African Party are identical, with  those of the Act of  Union, furnishes  areminder that  though Republican propaganda may not  be so  prominently advertisedat the moment, it is still being carried on in various parts of the Union.                                     FltANOK.    M. Caillaux, the most powerful, and  insidious danger  in  French politics, has at last been brought to book,  and the Chamber has been asked,  to suspend  his parlia-mentary privileges  in order that he may  be tried by court-martial for communicatingAvith  the enemy, and on&quot; a charge of having endangered the security of the State.                                    PORTUGAL.    A successful military insurrection in Lisbon has  brought about the  compulsoryresignation of the Costa Cabinet and has deposed the President.  As  far as can begathered,  Professor  and  Major Siclouio Paes, who  is  now master of the  politicalsituation, is not Germanophil and does not propose to change the form of government.He has given assurances that ali Portuguese engagements will be fulfilled, and thatPortugal intends to continue the war.
NORTHERN NEUTRALS.   There  is  further delay  in the economic negotiations owing to the sudden  andunexpected departure of the Linited States negotiators.                               SHIFTING SITUATION.   In spite of enemy efforts during November, there was an increase of nearly 39,000tons in the amount of  British mercantile tonnage available for  service  at the end  ofthe month over that ready for sea at  the beginning.13th December 1917.

1oPART  I. BRITISH  EMPIRE AND  AFRICA.                              IMPERIAL AFFAIRS.   With reference  to  the  establishment  of an Imperial Mineral Resources  Bureau(vide Reports Nos. 15, 16, and 37), the South African Ministers have telegraphed  thatthe scheme has their approval, and that  they  recommend, the appointment  of  theirHigh Commissioner (Mr. W. P. Schreiner) to represent the Union on  the governing-body.                                    CANADA.   ddie latest reports concerning the Halifax explosion place  the  number of  dead at,000 and. the injured at 8,000.  In addition there  are 25,000 people homeless,   ddiematerial damage is estimated at $30,000,000 and it is said that not a house in Halifaxhas escaped, damage,  ddie primary cause of the collision between the French steamer,which was carrying explosives, and the Belgian relief ship, is alleged to have  been theconfusing signals of one of the steamers.   The Minister of Justice (Mr. C. J.  Doherty) who was refused a hearing a week agoin the St. Ann&apos;s Division of Montreal and. was warned that his life would be endangeredif he attempted to hold  another meeting,  insisted,  on addressing a  meeting in the Irishquarter and refused  police protection,  ddie Minister was given,  a  good hearing andhe emphasised the disastrous effect which the defeat of the Military Service Act wouldhave upon American, sentiment at a time  when American support  was absolutely essential to winning the war.   Support to the Union Government is being given by the representatives of variousChurch  interests in the  Dominion,  including  Anglicans,  Presbyterians,  Baptists,and Methodists, while  the Roman. Catholic  Bishop of London (Out.) is urging his fellow  religionists to support  the  Union Government  and  not to  be  misled  &quot; by&quot; mistaken sympathy with a Province whose  religion must  not  be confounded  with&apos;&quot; its politics.&quot;  The Bishop dissociates himself from any attack  upon the section, ofthe Liberal Party led  by Sir  W. Laurier, but  points out that  it  cannot be denied that every element  opposed from the beginning to Canada&apos;s participation in thewar are united in opposition to the Union Government.   ddie Canadian Manufacturers&apos; Association, have  brought their  working  staffstogether in. order to urge their members from  the Atlantic to the -Pacific to  supportthe Union government.   The alliance  between.  Sir  W. Laurier and Mr. Bourassa, leader of the  French-Canadian Nationalists, has been, denounced by the President of the  Privy  Council(Mr. Rowell) at all his  meetings as an attempt to dominate  Canada  by  the  Quebecmajority,   ddie relationship of Quebec to the Western Provinces has been commentedupon by the Minister of Customs (Mr. A. L. Sifton), who lias pointed  out  that thereapportionment of constituencies on the basis  of increased, population is being putinto practice during this election, and  Western Canada will  have 56  representatives in the new Parliament instead of 34, as in. the old.  Mr.  Sifton estimates that in six years&apos; time, if the increase in  the  population  continues  at the same rate, the  Westwould  be entitled to 80 representatives, or about one-third of the  total membership of the Dominion House of Commons.   In. that case  &quot; the  West,&quot; he  declares,   &quot;wouldbe able to control the policy of the country,  and  be independent of race or  religion.or of solid Quebec.&quot;   The Premier of Quebec (Sir Lomer Gouin) has stated in a speech in Montreal thatif  the Union. Government are returned to power it will not  be  merely 100,000 menwho will go to the front, but double that number.   The Mayor of Montreal (Mr. Martin) has declared that if the French Conservatives,who are standing for constituencies  in. Quebec Province, are returned by the vote ofthe soldiers, it will mean nothing more nor  less than revolt on the part of the&apos; peopleof the Province.    With reference to the meeting at  Kitchener,  Ont., at which  the Prime  minister was refused a hearing  (vide  Report No. 44),  and  the decision   of the  City  council that no formal apology  to Sir Robert Borden was necessary, indignation mass meetings and the closing of all  the factories of the town as  a protest against the Council&apos;attitude, resulted in a resolution of apology being passed by the City Council.
   The Minister  of  Public Works  (Mr. F. B. Carvell) lias been returned unopposedfor Carleton, N.B., on account of the withdrawal of his  opponent, thus making thesecond. Minister to be returned without a contest.     -  I   ddie inclusion of  a  representative of  Labour  in the  Dominion  Cabinet and the promise that a further representative will  be added after the election, has given much.satisfaction, and it is anticipated that the great bulk of the Labour vote will be polledfor the  Union  Government.   The  President of &apos; the  Trades  and  Labour Council(Mr. J. C, Walters),  though declaring himself as  opposed to conscription before theelection, lias not made any pronouncement during the last few Weeks.*   &apos; The  first  draft of men under the Military Service Act, probably  amounting  to between 20,000 and 25,000 men, will be called to  the colours on 3rd January.    With reference to the.enquiry of  the Dominion Government, as  to  an estimate  ofthe orders likely to be placed for shipbuilding in Canadian yards (vide Report No. 45),the Dominion Government have telegraphed  that the persons who have  made applica-tion for permission  to build  ships for foreign account  state that. they cannot delaymaking t arrangements  for securing steel.  In reply the  Shipping Controller  hastelegraphed  his appreciation  of the importance  of placing as large orders for ship-building  as  possible in Canadian  yards, but he points out that the  practicability  ofthis  action depends  upon financial  arrangements, which are now being consideredby the Treasury.   Meantime the Controller  expresses the hope that no action will betaken which will, prevent his placing orders, and he suggests that though foreignersmight be permitted  to contract with. Canadian yards, no actual  building should be commended without the permission of the Dominion Government being  first obtained.   The death has occurred of Sir Mackenzie  Bowed, who was Prime Minister of theDominion in 1894-95.                      AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH.   The Prime Minister (Mr. Hughes) in dealing with the statement in the FrankfurterZeitung that the war situation in Europe would determine  the question as to whetherGermany  should:  be deprived  of her  Colonies, has  declared that  the future ofAustralia, New Zealand and the Pacific generally will, be determined not by what thepeople in those places desire, but by  the Peace Conference.  If Germany should be-victorious, he  said, she would take  as much of Australia,  New  Zealand  and the-Pacific as she wanted, and  she would  most  certainly demand the right of free entry for her goods.   &quot; Thus,&quot; he added, &quot; at one stroke Australians independence, national.&quot; institutions, political liberty,  and economic and  industrial  prosperity  would  be&quot; determined.&quot;   The Prime  Minister has declared that  it is  the intention of the  Government to-organise the  woman power of the Commonwealth without further delay.   A Regulation is being issued, by the Commonwealth Government prohibiting theemployment  in Australia of subjects of Allied countries of  military age.   This action.has  been decided upon pending  the  completion. of negotiations between the allied nations whereby subjects residing in other Allied  countries shall be made liable to-military service in their country of origin.   In reply to  the telegram relating  to the shipping position and the importance of releasing further  ships from coastal service (vide Report No. 44) the  commonwealth government have assured  the British authorities that  the gravity of  the situation, is realised, and that everything possible will be done to help the Empire,   ddie BritishGovernment are informed that they may confidently rely upon the matter being dealtwdth immediately after the Referendum has been, taken on 20th December.    Oh  the 27th  November officials  of the Commonwealth Government raided  the-office of the Queensland Government  printer and seized 10,000 copies  of Hansard&apos;sParliamentary  Debates, which  contained  a  report  of a specially arranged debate inthe Legislature upon  the  conscription issue.  The Parliamentary Debates gave  the anti-conscription arguments in large  type, and they have all been confiscated.  ThePrime Minister justifies his action  by publishing  a letter from the Secretary of  the anti-Conscription  League to two men of  German name, in. which  the scheme forevading the  Censorship  is  set out in full.   The Prime Minister  has challenged thePremier of the State (Mr. Ryan) to make outside Parliament the statements containedin the Parliamentary Report.                1 See, however, Reports No. 35, No. 87, and Appendix to No. 25.
   A. regulation  lias  been issued by the Common wealth  Government permittingsoldiers under 21 who are serving oversea, or who have returned, or who are encampedin Australia, to vote in the Referendum relating to conscription.   With reference to the introduction of legislation to enable the Empire to exercise control over non-ferrous metals, the Prime Minister has  expressed his  hope that themeasure will contain provisions for the total exclusion of enemy interests.  &quot;  anything else,&quot; he declares, &quot; would certainly renew Germany&apos;s economic dominion, and warnedby our  experiences we should make victory the sure  foundation of a lasting peace.&quot;Mr.  Hughes  has  telegraphed to  the British Government  urging that the limitationof the period and the restriction to nonderrous metals should be deleted from the Bill(which is now before the British House of Commons) in order to give full effect to theResolutions of the Paris Economic Conference.   With  reference to reinforcements for the live  Australian  Divisions, the  ArmyCouncil have telegraphed to the Commonwealth. Government  that they have  now beeninformed by the Oommander-in-Chief  that  these Divisions are short by more than11,000  infantry.   It  is pointed  out that  the  numbers  in  training in  the  UnitedKingdom  are  not more  than  sufficient to replace  normal wastage.   Under thesecircumstances the Army Council estimate that 25,000 infantry will, be required toreach England during the months of December to March inclusive and 25,000 additionaldrafts from April to June if the infantry of the Australian Divisions is to be raised toand  maintained  at war  establishment.   The difference  between  this and  formerestimates  arises from the fact that during the month  ending 26th October the severelighting caused a wastage of 14,000, or approximately an increase of 8,000 over theestimates.   ddie Commonwealth Government  have decided to form  a Federal  Constabulary,and  returned soldiers will be given a preference in the new force.   Free passages to Australia  for the wives of returned  soldiers who have beenmarried in Great Britain have been arranged by the  Commonwealth Government.                                NEW ZEALAND.   The accidents which have happened to ocean-going vessels  in Dominion harbours.have given rise to the suggestion that  explosives  have been placed in the holds, and-stringent  regulations are now being enforced for the examination of all cargo before being loaded.   Guards  are  also protecting  oversea  vessels  while at  the  loading-berths,   ddie regulations issued in July provided that no person should board a sea-going ship while  moored alongside any wharf or anchored in  any harbour without  the written permission of a military authority, owner,  master, or agent,  and that  the.masters of all such ships should engage a sufficient guard.   AVith  regard  to  the  proposal, of  the Serbian Government that a  Slav regimentshould be raised in New Zealand, recent statistics produced  by the Kaiparu Chamberof Commerce show that there were  1,105 Slavs in the north,  who  could be  classified as First Division men, of whom 765  were unnatnralised.  ddie proposal made  inParliament that they  should all be called up was abandoned in favour of utilising themen on war service (many  of them being  engaged  in  producing  food  for theDominion) at the New Zealand Expeditionary Force  rate of pay.   d.Tie new scale of pensions  under  the  Bill which was before the  last  session of1&apos;parliament provides that a man serving in  the British forces  will have  the pensiongranted by the British  Government  made up to the New Zealand  ExpeditionaryForce scale if the beneficiary  or  dependant, as  the  case may be, was a  bond fideresident of New Zealand prior to enlisting.   The Minister of  Defence (Sir JamesAllen) pointed out that New Zealand was providing what no other country has provided,viz., that  the children of a man marrying within two years of  his discharge shall beentitled to a pension.   He  also  called attention to the  provision  that pensionsshall not be reviewed  by reason  of any change  in the  earning capacity  of  thebeneficiary, this being designed to induce the partially disabled man to train himself and  to earn money,   ddie proposals, the Minister declared, placed New  Zealand ahead of any other country  of the world.                                SOUTH  AFRICA.    The Prime Minister (General Botha) in a speech  at Johannesburg, referred . to the grave responsibility of the Government in regard  to  the racial question, which, hesaid, they must  be careful not to raise again  in  South Africa.  He urged the people     4529-2                            IJ
to stand solidly behind the Act of Union, the principles of which were  the  principles of  the South African Party.   Whether in war, rebellion or strikes, the Party, he said, must maintain these principles, and people who paraded the Republican  propagandawere only trying to gain votes and&apos; to bring the two white races into conflict.    At the  above-mentioned meeting,  General Botha stated  that work  had  beenprovided  for the great  majority  of returned, soldiers who had.  applied  for  it.  he expressed the hope that the Government^ large irrigation and afforestation schemes would eventually afford employment for many ex-soldiers-:..    In consequence  of  the  shortage  of  native  labour, the Union Government havedecided to permit the importation of 1,000 or  more natives from north of  latitude 22Q,and if the experiment proves successful, the mines will secure a large amount of fresh. labour.  These natives will he inoculated against pneumonia.    ddie Union  Minister of Mines (Mr. Malan) has announced that  if the Commissionnow sitting reports that there  is any profiteering  in connection  with  the necessariesof life the  matter will he at once dealt wdth by the Union Government.                                 GOLD  COAST.                       &apos;  -   The Secretary of  State  has telegraphed  his agreement with  the  view of  theGovernor  as to the desirability of deporting all. German Missionaries, and, if possible,all their colleagues of other nationalities in the Basle Trading Society or the Mission.It is  suggested that action  with regard to the Germans should be taken at once.                           GERMAN EAST  AFRICA.   General Northey has  reported that there  are  now  no German troops  in german east Africa.   The whole of the enemy&apos;s Western force proceeded south-eastwards andwas surrounded by General van. DeventeFs main force south of Massassi.   There now only remain the en.emy&apos;s original Eastern force of about,  200 Europeans and 1,500natives, who are in Portuguese East Africa and appear to be moving towards Mwembeand threatening Nyasaland.   With reference to the telegram relating   to  co-operation between Belgian andBritish forces  in East Africa (vide Report No. 45),  the British  Minister  to the BelgianGovernment states that  a telegram has  been received from the Belgian Commanderto the effect that the proclamation issued by the British  General contemplated  furtherco-operation with the Belgian Army now serving in East Africa.  Before replying,therefore, to the telegram, the Belgian  Government are  awaiting further  informationas to the position, of  the British. Government in the matter.   In  an article appearing in the Vossische  Zeitung of 9th December, German EastAfrica is spoken  of as  a country which &quot; must  remain German or the prestige ofGermairy in the coloured parts of the world will, disappear.&apos;&apos;  The writer states thatthe country &quot;  is one  of those possessions to which we must cling,  and ive should prove&quot; ourselves unworthy if  we did  not  joyfully  make  everything  dependent upon  our&quot; holding it.&quot;                       PORTUGUESE  EAST  AFRICA.   In.  contemplation of  an attack on Port Amelia by the Germans, the Portuguese.Commander  has requested that British  troops  may  be  despatched  to that&quot; place.General van  Deventer proposes to send  the Gold Coast Regiment for this  purpose,but in order to avoid difficulties he urges the necessity of the Portuguese evacuatingPort Amelia, and leaving the command of  the British  forces  in Portuguese  territory to him.   The British Government are  therefore seeking  the concurrence of  thePortuguese Government in this suggestion, and it is pointed out that every assistance should be  given to General van  Deventer,  including the  provision of carriers ifoccasion demands, failing which it may be found necessary to leave the Portugueseto defend their own territory alone.
PART  II.-FOREIGN AFFAIRS.                              ALLIED  AFFAIRS.    The Russian Ambassador in London has  advised the Foreign Office  that theRussian Minister in Teheran is  anxious that the Allies should inform the ProvisionalGovernments which  have  been  constituted in the  Ukraine,  in  Kuban,  Terek,  and.Transcaucasia that no relations will be  entertained with the Bolshevists in Petrograd.,who will not be recognised  as a legal power.   The  Minister has offered  to  transmitsuch declarations on behalf of the Allies to these Provisional Governments with which.he hopes to establish relations.    Commander Wedgwood, M.P.,  has  suggested  that  as  Russia will  probably  fall into the. position of a German  Dependency as a result of making peace with germany which  will enable Germans to secure  the reorganisation, business and. financial control-of the country, it is to the interest of the Allies that this German  Russia should heas small  as possible.   He  therefore  proposes that tbe various  States and  Peopleswhich  have emerged  amid the ruin  of the  Russian Empire,  and asserted their independence Siberia, &quot;Finland,  Georgia,  Ukraine,  Cossacks should immediately be  recognised  and assisted to maintain that independence  as  the best means of restricting the  area within which German influence can. spread  to the detriment ofthe Allies.    Sir C. Greene  learns&apos;  that the Japanese Government  is not inclined,  to  take any steps in response to the French  suggestion  made in Tokyo on 5th December&apos;that japan  should. &quot; intensify her sacrifices &quot; on behalf of the Allied, cause in Europe.    ddie Foreign Office has again  had reason  to animadvert on  the  disconcertingmethods  adopted, by  the  United  States- Government  in  its  negotiations  with thenorthern neutrals, and  points out  to-Sir C. Spring Rice that the principal AmericanDelegate  has left Paris for Washington  in  spite  of  assurances  to the effect that hewould  confer with the Swedish and Dutch missions ill London.    The adhesion,  of China and Panama to the Allied Enemy Property convention has been invited, but. Sir C. Mallet advises the Foreign. Office  that the Government ofPanama is  unlikely  to take independent action  in  any war measure without theapproval of Washington.    Sir  H. Rumbold  learns indirectly that  the  Swiss Government would welcome adeclaration  on the part of Great  Britain in favour of the maintenance of the neutrality of Switzerland, either in conjunction with the proposed  declaration, of the UnitedStates  Government to that effect or as  an independent act.  In consequence of  this the British Minister has been, instructed, to inform the swiss  Government that GreatBritain reaffirms the Treaties and. Declarations  of 18.1.5, and will respect the integrity and neutrality of Switzerland so long as  they are maintained  by the Swiss  andrespected, by the enemy.  France has made a similar communication to the federal government.    Lord  Bertie reports that  the  French  members  of the  Interallied  PurchasingCouncil are the Ministers of Commerce and Armaments (MM. Clementel. and Loucheur)and M. Paul Bag:ion.                                  &apos; FRANCE.   Mr. Vicars reports  from Lyons  on. 7th December that the Loire strike is at  anend.   The Senate has suspended the parliamentary privileges of Senator Humbert in theLenoir case, and  has authorised legal proceedings against  him  on the charge oftrafficking with the enemy.  Lord Bertie reports that on 11th December  GeneralDubail, the  Military Governor of Paris, has applied, through  the Prime  Minister, tothe Chamber of Deputies, for the suspension of the  parliamentary  privileges ofM. Caillaux. a former  Prime Minister, and  M. Loustalot, in order  that they may be tried by court-martial on the charge of endangering the safety  of the State.
s                                    ITALY.   Sir R. Rodd  learns that Baron Sonnino fears that pacifist energies are now beingsecretly directed to the preparation of a peace programme unknown to the Government..Meanwhile  three.other former Deputies  have been arrested  for complicity in theCavallini intrigues with Caillaux,  the ex-Khedive and Bolo.   Sir R.  Rodd reports the  signature of the Military Service Agreement  betweenGreat  Britain and.  Italy,  which  was  laid before the Italian  Parliament  on 11thDecember.        &apos;   The Minister for Foreign Affairs has informed  the  British  Ambassador thatmartial law has been iiroelaimed in eight more provinces of Lombardy and Emilia inorder to facilitate the control of undesirables and espionage.                                    SERBIA.   In view of the great difficulty in getting recruits for the Serbian Army owing to-the fact that almost the whole of the  Kingdom is in the  hands of the enemy, repre-sentations have again  been made to  the Italian Government  in  order to secure therelease of Croatian, Slovene, and other Southern Slavs  held as prisoners of war.  SirR. Rodd reports,  however, that  the Italian  Government  is suspicious  of the SouthSlavs, afraid of Austrian reprisals, and entirely unwilling to  do more than release anoccasional Serbian sympathiser.                                   GREECE.   Lord Granville has been informed that Great Britain and France will each open abook  credit of 25,000,000 francs, which is to be accorded to the National Bank of greece  as  cover for the issue  of  notes to that amount.  This advance is included inthe 750,000,000 francs (30,000,0001.) which  will be  placed,  at  the disposal, of theGreek Government according  to  its needs,  as approved by the Interallied FinancialCommission  to  be established in Athens,  during  1918.   The  Interallied  military commission  will advise as to the expenditure on  the  armed forces of  the GreekCrown.   In view of French opposition to the suggestion, there will be no Italian participation in the Port Control at the Pirmus.                                  PORTUGAL.   On 5th December part of the Army in Lisbon made a pronunciamienCc against the-Government and sympathetic movements took place at Oporto  and elsewhere in thenorth.  Idie Navy supported the  Government, but after fighting, characterised bySir L. Carnegie as severe, the insurgents  were victorious and during the night of 7th-8th December  the  Ministry,  which had  proceeded on.  board the  Portuguesewarship  Vasco da Garna earlier in the day,  resigned, and the greater part of its members  took  refuge  on, board  a  British warship.   Dr.  Alfonso  Costa,  the PrimeMinister, and  Senhor Augusto Soares, Minister for Foreign Affairs, were arrested atOporto, and on 9th December Dr. Bernardino Machado, the President of the Republic,was  arrested and deposed,  ddie Revolutionary Committee has notified the Dean ofthe Diplomatic Corps of its assumption of power and has dissolved Congress,   Sir L.  Carnegie has been informed by Major de Sidonio Paes, the President of theRevolutionary Committee, that the Provisional Government will maintain with pridethe ancient alliance with Great Britain and will faithfully fulfil all engagements madein the name of the Portuguese nation.  Major Paes, formerly  a Professor of  Mathe-matics at the University of Coimbra and subsequently Minister of  Public Works inthe Chagas Cabinet of 1911 and  Minister of  Finance  in the Vasconcellos Cabinet inthe same year, was Portuguese Minister in Berlin until the declaration  of war against
Germany.   He  has given assurances  that, the movement which  he has  guided tosuccess is in no way Monarchist nor pro-German.   According to a  Renter  telegram, Senhor  Bracamp has become President of theRepublic.                              GERMAN  AFFAIRS.   According to a despatch  from Sir F. Yiliters dated  29th November, a certainHerr  Richter, manager of the Nobel, works at Hamburg, who  is a  member of theEmperoPs semi-official Commercial Council, and is also to be appointed member  of acommittee for the reconciliation of Germany with the nations of the&apos; Entente, has madestatements which are thus briefly summarised :           &quot; We  know that we must evacuate Belgium  and give compensation for  her       losses ; it is only at this price,  to which we are resigned, that peace is possible.          &quot; Our position  will, however, be such that we shall not be able to pay at       once, for  the amount will  be large.  We have  but  little,  and what we have       must be kept to meet our own  first necessities after the conclusion of peace.          &quot; Our proposal is to ask the Entente to advance  to  Belgium the sum  due,       which we will, repay by annuities, including interest.        ,  &quot; We shall in no way interfere with Belgian life or concerns.          &quot; Germany is absolutely ruined, for the Americans have inflicted a fatal       blow in seizing the raw materials  accumulated  in the United States.  These       were counted upon to supply German,  industry  after the war.   It wdll  now be       necessary to purchase raw materials at  a high price, if  any are available,   and       in this case no underselling will be possible.          &quot; ddie greatest danger for us would be that  the Entente should oppose  the       re-establishment  of our commerce and industries  until  all  the  devastated       countries  have  been  restored and.  indemnified.   That would   be finis       Gennanice.          &quot; Moreover, we shall not be alone in requiring to replenish our stock of  raw       materials.  Austria wants  a share,  and. this we shall probably be  obliged to       refuse.  Hence great difficulties will arise for which we  are already preparing.          &quot; Our financial situation is very bad, the market is poisoned by paper money       which may well become valueless.          &quot;The. Austrian kronen with  which   Germany  is flooded  are   greatly       depreciated, and this matter will have to be settled.  As we have but little of       the gold  wdiich is indispensable,  and. as the  State will  require money, it is       proposed after the Avar to levy one enormous contribution of 20 to 25 per cent.       upon  fortunes above a  figure to be fixed.  This, it is calculated, would bring       in  25  milliards, a sum  sufficient to meet the  most urgent needs.          &quot; The people want peace, disarmament, and  suppression of the Army.  The       Government know  this  and will, have  to yield,  but the officers  are still left in       ignorance.&quot;                                                     . .   Furthermore, only a very gradual demobilisation will be possible  as a revolutionis feared if too many soldiers return simultaneously to  find nothing but starvation anddistress in their homes.   Sir M.  Findlay  reports information  to the effect  that while the military shell ofGermany  is still impervious the  civil kernel, is so rotten  that covered vans have-topatrol the streets of Berlin and Constantinople with concealed batteries of machine guns, and on the formation of the slightest crowd  these are displayed ready  for use.In Hamburg machine-guns are reported to be mounted at street corners.   Sir  G. Buchanan  learns  that the first  Bolshevist  delegate  on the  armistice commission  formed the opinion from his conversation  with the German delegates thatGermany  was exhausted and was craving for&apos;peace.  The Bolshevist therefore suggeststhat negotiations should  he protracted as  long as possible, in order to gain time forfostering a revolutionary movement among German workmen.   Sir H.  Rumbold quotes the  Socialist  Deputy Bernstein as having confessed thatwhile  no revolution is likely in Germany  during the war  unless  the  Allies  winvictories the  GoA-ermiient is much exercised by President Wilsohs habit of drawing a distinction between the  German  people and its  rulers.  The Deputy hopes that an
indemnity will be inflicted upon Germany as a means of discrediting the ruling classin the eyes of  the masses, and advises the Allies to make  use  of  their most  effectiveweapon, the Economic Offensive after the war, as a means of terrorising the  Germancommercial classes.   In connection with this question of demobilization, the Vossische Zeitung  calls forthe making of arrangements whereby every soldier on release from the ranks shouldhe healthily housed, insured against unemployment after  a  preliminary period forrest and recuperation,  and for the reform of the sickness and old age pension schemes.The  journal presses  for  immediate attention  to  these details as there is  now not much time to lose.   Sir R. Paget reports that the weekly bread.ration in Leipzig is 3&quot;85 lbs. per head,meat just less than. 5 ounces, and butter  or fat about 1 ounce.   The vorwarts announces the formation of the Bund der Eaisertreuen (League ofThose Faithful to the Emperor) which will carry on that internal  political work fromwhich  the Fatherland Party is debarred  by its constitution.    The  Duke  of Saxe-Coburg  and Gotha is President, and  the  new  League,  the  motto of which  is&quot; Render  unto the People the things that are  the People.&apos;s,  and unto the Emperorthe things that  are the emperor&apos;s,&quot; strongly opposes the parliamentarisation of  theImperial  Government as being the first  step  towards that  democratisation  whichaims at  the  downfall of  the  German Empire.   The same journal  accuses  theConservative Kreuz Zeitung of trying to involve the monarchy itself in the approachingcatastrophe to the Conservative Party,  and points out that the  Throne has no more dangerous enemies  at  the present moment than the professional Monarchists.   the conservatives  are  opposed  to the Prussian Reform Bill, which is ardently supportedby  the  parties  of the Left,  in spite  of its absolutist  financial provisions  whichallow a government to fall back  on  the  previous  Budget if a new one be refused byParliament, and  of its disfranchisement of all soldiers for at least  a year after the endof the war by. means of the residence qualification  for voters.                                NETHERLANDS.   Mr. van Vollenhoven, who was the Dutch negotiator in the United States, willprobably again  represent his country  in  the fresh  negotiations in London on the-subject of  Allied control of Dutch  tonnage  in United States  ports  and the rationschemes for Holland.                                SWITZERLAND.  -   Sir H. Rumbold reports that in view of the  Swiss gratification at the steps takento assure their  corn supply, the atmosphere  is  now more favourable for pushing theloan negotiations.   The Foreign  Office has instructed him to press for twelve and a half million francs per month, although ten million maybe accepted in the last resort,particularly if the Italian demands for accommodation, which are to  be kept quiteseparate, reach or exceed the difference,  ddie Minister learns that the Swiss Govern-ment is itself likely to need a loan in  the  near future, and this may possibly lead todelaj&apos; if the amount demanded overburdens the market.    Sir II. Rumbold is advised that  the German  Government is  prepared to restore the  cocoa. stolen  in  transit  from Holland  to Switzerland during  September  andthe  Swiss have  again pressed for  the restoration of the  transit traffic which was-stopped on account of this theft,  ddie Foreign Office is  disposed to allow sugar andmalt again  to  be  sent through Germany, and has invited the opinion of the FrenchGovernment on the subject.    ddie co-operation of the Allies is being  invited for the purpose of bringing jointpressure upon the Swiss to induce them to declare exactly what stocks of enemy goodsat present exist in  Switzerland  and to undertake that no  further  accumulations ofsuch stocks will be permitted.   ddie Commercial Agreement between the United States and Switzerland was signedjust  too soon for provisions to this effect to be embodied in it.
                                    NORWAY.   The economic negotiations are not yet settled and. the new United States proposals have - been  met with   counter  suggestions.  Sir  C.  Spring Rice learns  that  the norwegians fear that any further concessions on their part beyond what was  offered in their  original terms  will cause trouble with  Germany, and that  they have beenstiffened  in their attitude of defiance as a result of the Royal meeting in Christiania.   Sir M. Findlay, however, after a conversation with the Prime Minister, reports thatstarvation is a weapon to which Norway will yield without much  delay and  suggeststhat if the United States could undertake  to supply shipbuilding material and girdersa settlement might be facilitated.   Sir E. Howard  and  Sir. R. Paget have directly  contradictory information as towhether the question of  Finland and  the Aaland  Islands was  discussed at the Royalmeeting.                                  ..  SWEDEN.   ddie Foreign  Office   advises Sir E. Howard that the privilege  of telegraphing incypher has been restored to the  Swedish Minister in London, and intimates that  theremoval of the suspicious members  of the Swedish Legation in London is looked forin return.   Sir E. Howard reports  that the Swedish Government, which has been unofficiallyadvised  of  the  declaration of independence on  the part of  Finland, is at presentunlikely to recognise this independence unless some regular Russian Government  willfirst do so.  ddie Swedish Minister for Foreign Affairs explained that the independence of Finland was greatly  to the  interest of  Sweden, but considered  that the question ofRussian recognition would  be greatly influenced  by the nearness  of  the  frontier off inland to Petrograd, from which it is distant only 20 miles.                                   DENMARE.    Sir R. Paget learns  that under the new agreement with Germany  22,000 tons shipbuilding material   will be exported  to Denmark during  the next few months,which will provide employment in  many yards.  Ships built with these materialswill only be allowed to  trade with Scandinavia or Germany.  The  Minister has  alsobeen advised that the recruiting of Danish labour for employment in  Great  britain should be done very quietly, otherwise Germany  will do her best to spoil  the  marketby offering high wages, and the political leaders of the Social Democrats  in Denmarkwill oppose the  departure of the  workmen.  In  spite of this a  certain number of danish mechanics have already found employment in this country, and their transport is being officially facilitated.    Sir R. Paget reports that the Austro-Danish negotiations regarding the importationof lubricating oils have been concluded,  and 7,000  barrels, chiefly of  light oils,  areexpected to arrive in Denmark early next year-.    Owing to fresh proposals  on the  part of  the  United  States Government,  it  hasbeen  found impossible to continue the economic  negotiations with Denmark inLondon,  and Mr.  Gluckstadt,  the  Danish  negotiator,  is,  therefore,  leaving  forDenmark.    Sir R. Paget is informed that the Danish Government proposes to  fix the  butterration at 8.1 oz,s. per head weekly.                                     SPAIN.    Sir A. Hardinge, in  a despatch dated  21-th November, reports  that differences ofopinion  as to  the advisability of a  dissolution  have arisen in the Cabinet.   Idieseappear  to turn on  the question of  the  proposed Amnesty, for which legislation isconsidered necessary as it is possible that the Royal Prerogative, though fully capableof commuting a death  penalty or  releasing a prisoner, is unable to  affect the civildisabilities incurred by some  of those who are intended to benefit by the Amnesty.    Idie signature of the Commercial Agreement between Great  Britain and Spain  was announced on 9th December.
                                    JAPAN.  &apos; The Japanese  Embassy in  Washington has announced the arrival of  japanese troops at Vladivostock.  Sir C. Greene reports that fears were entertained  by theJapanese  Government that  this port  might  be  made the  base of  German  andBolshevist naval activities in the Pacific.                                    CHINA.   Sir J. Jordan reports that owing to the action of the Russian garrison at  Harbinin Manchuria in going over to the  Bolshevists the Allied  Ministers in Peking have invited the Chinese Government to send,  troops there&apos; to restore  order.  He fears,however, that  the Chinese may not be strong enough, to cope with the Bolshevists,who number some 10,000, and considers that Japan may have to take action.   In view of  the pressing danger that Bolshevists or released enemy prisoners fromRussian territory may get into touch with  the uninterned.  enemy subjects in China,Japan has agreed  to support the Allied  representations pressing for the  immediatedeportation of all enemy subjects from the  country.   The extension  of the Military Service Acts to include British subjects in China isbeing considered.                                 ARGENTINA.   Sir R. Tower learns that the Argentine Government has  requested  Germany towithdraw the staff of the German Legation in Buenos  Ayres,  in  consequence of therevelations in Count Luxburg&apos;s telegrams.                                .  URUGUAY.   Mr. Mitchell limes reports that the Uruguayan  Government is anxious about theattitude of the Argentine on the subject  of  territorial  waters in  the River  Plateshould the question arise in connection with. German, submarines.   The Minister forForeign Affairs  hopes  that Great  Britain  will  take   advantage   of  the present negotiations with the Argentine to secure the adoption of an attitude  towards  thesecraft similar to that of Uruguay in order to avoid difficulties.                                    BRAZIL..   Sir E. Howard learns that Germany is endeavouring to embroil Brazil with theArgentine by arranging for two Argentine ships bought by Germany and loaded withgrain,  nominally for  Gothenburg, and  actually for a German port, to run the risk ofbeing held up by Brazilian patrols.                                     CHILE.   It appears probable that Chile has ceded Easter Island, in  the Pacific, about 2,150miles from the coast of the Republic,  to Japan in return for a  supply of  munitions.There is reason to fear the  influence of German intrigues, and Sir F. Stronge, whoreports  Italian co-operation in making representations on the use of Chilean ports by enemy submarines or raiders, has been advised that  the further supply of munitions to Chile may now no  longer be  facilitated,  and that the Admiralty is delaying the delivery of torpedoes for the submarines recently acquired by the Republic.
                                   ECUADOR.   In October  the Government of Ecuador declined  to permit Dr. Perl, tben about toleave Lima on account  of  tbe  rupture  of  diplomatic  relations between  Peru andGermany to proceed to Quito, although be was properly accredited as German Ministerto Ecuador.  Mr. Wilson, having reported that the Government of Ecuador has  nowformally announced a rupture of diplomatic relations  with  Germany as  from 7thDecember, the British Government has congratulated the Minister for Foreign affairs on the action taken.   This rupture has caused the revocation  of  the exequatur of thevarious German Consuls  in Ecuador and. synchronizes with the capture of  the rebelleader and the collapse of the late rebellion.                                 VENEZUELA.   Mr. Beaumont  learns that the Government of Venezuela is probably now ready toabandon its neutrality should  an opportunity  be afforded.   He attributes this changeof opinion to the thoroughness of the United States war propaganda.                                   PANAMA.   On 10th December Panama declared war, as from. 11th December, against Austria-Hungary,   ddiis will facilitate the extrusion of enemy aliens from the Canal zone.                                    MEXICO.  .. The State Department in Washington now has information  that General Carranzais definitely implicated in a  German-supported  scheme to attack the United States inthe near future, but  owing to the action of the United States  in recognizing theGeneral  as  President, the situation  is somewhat  complicated.   Moreover,  it now appears  that General Pablo Gonzalez, at  one  time favoured  by the United states ambassador in Mexico City  as a  possible successor, is really Germanophil, and bothMr. Cummins and the French Minister consider that a mere change of leaders wouldnot reclaim  the Carranzist party from its German  connection.   Carranza  has,however, asked  Congress for authority to erect  a new and discriminating  tariff to beused,  as  an  economic weapon, regardless  of the  existence of international  treatiescontaining the &quot; most-favoured-nation &quot; clause,  ddiis, in the opinion  of  the  UnitedStates Ambassador, is likely  to provoke President Wilson.  At the same  time, Mexico isreported by Mr. Cummins to be on the point of  starting a policy of phr-pricks againstthe United. States.   In  view  of this, and  of  the fact  that  the  United  states ambassador is  understood to have lost faith in  General Obregon  Cabrera as capableof being put forward as a  substitute for  Carranza, it  is interesting to learn thatovertures to Senor Iturbide have  been made by a United States  official.   Idiese aresecret at present, as a reputation, for being supported by Washington  is no passportto public favour in Mexico.   In these circumstances the American Ambassador has expressed surprise that theBritish  Government  should be likely to recognize  Carranza,  as  non-recognition ofthis General has won  for Great Britain a stronger position in Mexico to-day than thatenjoyed by any other  country.   In reply to  a Foreign Office query, Mr. Cummins reports  that General Pelaez, ifprovided with  arms  and ammunition by the Allies, can seize and hold  the  passescovering theddunpico District, and thus protect the oil-fields during the war from theGerman-inspired aggression of General carranza, who hopes  to  secure possession ofthem,  as a means of compelling the United States to agree to his  demands by threats of prohibition of export or even destruction of  the wells.  Mr. Cummins understandsthat the  Carranzists are making arrangements  to delude  General.  Pelaez into  makingpeace with them with a view to his subsequent  assassination.    45292                              D
                               UNITED STATES.   President Wilson signed  the declaration  of  war  against  Austria-Hungary  on 8th December, and  Sir 0. Spring Pice reports  that the temper of Congress,  whichwished also to declare war on Turkey and Bulgaria, is very warlike  as a result of thegrowth of the war spirit in the constituencies during November.   Sir C. Spring Rice learns  that  in  the Military ^Service Convention  now being-negotiated between, the United States  and Italy, the Italian Ambassador is  trying, to-obtain the inclusion of  a  provision for the arrest  of deserters from, merchantmen aswell as from  the Army or Navy, and reports that this  may require special legislation.to suspend tbe operation of  the Seamehs Act on that point which would probably be opposed by the Seamen&apos;s Union.                            SHIPPING  SITUATION.   According to the  War  Trade Intelligence Report, the total tonnage of 500 tonsgross in the case of steamers and 100 tons gross in the case of sailing ships reported lost owing to the-malice of  the King&apos;s enemies during the  period  30th November 6th December inclusive, is 65,710 tons, of which 37,718 tons were British, as comparedwith 109,072 tons, of  which 76,440 were British, reported last week.   The following statement, in the preparation  of  which the Ministry of Shippingco-operates with the Admiralty, shows the position of British merchant shipping atthe beginning  and end  of  November, after  taking into  consideration the amount oftonnage laid up for the repairs made, necessary by enemy action as well as ordinarymarine risks : -                 .i	Tons, gross.

The amount of newly-built tonnage entered for service  exceeded the amount of tonnage  actually sunk by 7,421 tons, but,  on the other hand, while655,456 tons of shipping were discharged ready for service  after repair 1,475,656 tons.had to be laid up for repair.  It may be noted also, that according to other Admiraltyfigures the amount of British-built shipping which has been entered for service during;1917 up to the end of November is 1,032,420 tons.
    According to the German Wireless, General von Ludendorff made a statement to a,representative of the Vienna Neue Freie Presse in which he referred to the german submarine policy as being somewhat different from that announced by Grand AdmiralvottTirpitz.   The General is reported to have said :-           &quot;Since our submarine warfare gave America the pretext  for  entering, into       the war this question is  of like significance;as the other  question whether our       submarine  warfare was  right.   On  this point my conviction,  has not changed.       The submarine1 warfare  was right. It has accomplished, and. will further accom-       plish, what we have expected from it.  We did not think, that our submarines       could; starve out  England in. a few, months.  If I were to  give you a look into       the documents of the highest Army Command., you would see that  from the.       beginning  onwards we have  wished less to produce  special  effects  by our       submarine  warfare  than  general effects.   Our aim  was  not to starve out       England, but to make her inclined to peace.&quot;    According to a German Press report  the  German  Government has  now  paidcompensation for  sinking the  Blommersdyh and damaging  the Ryndyh, 249,787L inthe former case, and 61,876/,. in the latter.    The  Bolshevists  have  prohibited  the  sale,  mortgage or  charter of Russianmerchantmen to foreign  subjects or firms, have voided all sales  and charter-parties ofthis nature concluded since 1st August 1914, and have  forbidden the departure of all ships affected by this  Decree from Russian ports.    Mr. Consul  Smith  at  Barcelona reports that on 6th December orders were issued from Madrid to prohibit  all sailings of  ships of 500 tons and upwards for abroad, andthe British Ambassador  has  advised the Foreign Office  that he is making  represen-tations to the Spanish Government on  the  subject, as this  order  appears directly tocontravene the newly-signed Commercial Agreement.    Owing to the disaster at  Halifax, Nova  Scotia, the examination, of neutral  vesselsat that port.is temporarily suspended.    Sir C. Spring Rice reports  action  on the  part  of  the  War Trade- Board  which-increases the desirability of co-ordinating the commercial Black  Lists of Great Britain,France and the United States.    The Foreign Office has made proposals to the United. State for the use  of  neutral vessels controlled  by  tbe two Governments, and. for  the sharing of the responsibility -for providing for the tonnage needs of France and Italy.   It is hoped that these  willbe accepted as a  preliminary to further discussion with the French and Italian shippingdelegates.    Sir 0. Spring  Rice is informed that the States  Department is  anxious that the brazilian ex-enemy ships to be used  by France should be available  for  war tradeservice in the North Atlantic generally and not  restricted to trade  between  Franceand Brazil as is, apparently, at  present arranged.                             PEACE  DISCUSSIONS.   An armistice between the Rumanians and the enemy came into effect at 10.30 p.m.on 9th December along the whole Rumanian front.   The Bolshevists  have circulated by wireless the  following  declaration  of peacedesiderata :           &quot;  There must be no forced annexations.          &quot;  The  destiny of  peoples, their economic  life, their  State,  their culture       must not be decided by the bayonet.          &quot;  To the free will of the people itself must  be loft their inclusion,  in  one       State or another, or their political independence.          &quot;  All  peoples who are conscious  of  oppression must  by means of  a       referendum be given the possibility of free  expression regarding their  future       destinies.   All  refugees must be returned for this purpose, and the Foreign       Armies must be sent away.&quot;. ;          &quot;  This principle  must be applied  in all  belligerent  countries mother       countries and colonies alike.  Districts which have particularly suffered from       the devastations of war must receive indemnities  from art International Fund       to be created  by taxing  the capitalist classes of all belligerent countries,       because these classes are entirely responsible for the present war.&quot;
                                   GENERAL.   The Anglo-Ottoman negotiations, both, in Beme and at Foujes, as  to  an exchangeof civilians and invalid prisoners of war, are still in progress.   The Adjutant-general has  advised  General  Belfield in Berne that the condition  of British prisoners atChangri is  deplorable,  and presses  for  their removal from  this insanitary  prisonbefore the weather breaks.  The Dutch Minister in Constantinople requires  T15,000monthly for the supply of food to prisoners east of Aleppo, but cannot feed the others.He therefore  urges that parcels shoidd be  sent  if there be  any evidence  of their arrival.
