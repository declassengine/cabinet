SECRET.APPRECIATION OF  THE  ATTACHE])  WESTERN  AND  GENERAL                           REPORT,  No.  30.                            INTER-IMPERIAL  EXCHANGE.   The Canadian  financial  deadlock  has  been  postponed  over  this  month by-anticipating 20 out of 25 million dollars of the Dominion Governments Septemberappropriation.  But it is no nearer  solution.   Meanwhile, Mauritius affords  a neatlittle  illustration of the  present state of  inter-Imperial exchange.   England  needssugar from Mauritius ; Mauritius needs foodstuffs and other  necessaries from India.In the  absence of  a  common  medium  of  exchange, England cannot  settle withMauritius  by  any  form  of payment  that Mauritius can pass on to  India ;  Englandcannot settle with  India direct, the exchange situation being already stretched to theutmost T Mauritius cannot afford to pay in actual rupees, which  India  insists  upon.So the only solution is to send to India Mauritius  sugar, which Englands needs  andIndia presumably does not need.  In the same way England  urgently needs  shellsand foodstuffs from Canada :  Canada  is extremely anxious to provide both.  But inthe absence of an inter-Imperial  medium of exchange, the only alternative  is to cutdown Canadian orders  and  increase  our  financial  and political subjection to theUnited  States.                                 N E W F 0 U N PI/AND.   With regard to the shipping facilities available  for the export of Newfoundlandfish, the situation will, of course, be altered if the project for importing frozen fish ona large  scale for feeding  the population of  these islands is favourably reported on bythe Committee which is at present investigating the  proposal.   It is claimed in favourof the  idea that, over and above the  saving  in tonnage as between the journey from newfoundland and that from South America,  a much greater amount of nourishmentcan be carried  by the same  tonnage  in the shape of frozen fish  than in the shape of beef.                                      ITALY.   The more  reasonable attitude of  the  Italian public towards Serbian aspirationsdoes not, unfortunately, appear to be  matched hy the Italian attitude in Greece.  Thecontinued  occupation of Epirus and the attempt to play off Albanians against Greeksin that region are  undoubtedly increasing  the difficulties of the Allies and of their friends in  Greece.                                    GERMANY.    Dr.  Michaelis&apos;s declaration that the fixation of nitrogen is likely to be one of &quot;thosenew forms of  production to which the German  Government  will have to look for revenue raises a problem which will have  to  be considered  in all countries after thewar.  The German view is that  the  revenue  required after  the  war  cannot possibly be raised by ordinary direct  or indirect taxation, but that the State will have to &quot; tapproduction at  the source &quot;  by  directly ajjpropriating certain forms of production,preferably those which are not already the subject of long-established industries with large vested interests.
                                      SIAM.   The suggestion that all Germans in Siam should he sent back to Germany ratherthan interned in India, in  order  to make it more  difficult for them to resume their commercial activities after the war, brings out one very important aspect of the entry of our various new Allies in outlying parts of  the world, viz., the breaking up of thewhole network of German commercial and industrial agencies over the world.                                 UNITED  STATES.   Sir W.  Wiseman&apos;s warning as to the necessity of keeping in effective touch withthe American Autocracy,  and  of employing men of the highest rank  and personal capacity for the purpose, is worth noting.                               PEACE  DISCUSSIONS.   Dr. Michaelis&apos;s comment on the Papal Note, sums up the situation very well fromthe German point of view.  Germany is not concerned to discuss the particular termsof peace outlined,  but she entirely approves  of anything that  will  create &quot; peaceatmosphere,&quot;  because she hopes that this will bring  about a Peace Conference whilethe military situation is still in her favour.  No peace proposal can be too unpracticalfor German purposes as long as  it helps in any way to stimulate the desire for peace.Any  particular suggestion which  does not  suit German interests can  always  be dismissed by a.rattle of the sword at the Conference itself.  For the Allies, who have so far got  the worst of the war, at any rate  in the military sphere, but who believethat their superior resources wall enable  them to wdn it in the end, it is a mistake toencourage  any peace atmosphere or discussion of terms.                                                                      L. S.  A.23rd August 1917.

PART  I.-BRITISH  EMPIRE  AND 9 AFRICA.                                   CANADA.    Ottawa telegrams of loth August describe  the  procedure by which members ofthe Dominions  Overseas Forces (including  Canadians in the  Aviation and naval forces of Great  Britain) will be enabled to vote under the Military Voters&apos; Bill, whichis intended to replace legislation passed in 19.15.   A general returning officer will beappointed to receive all the returns of the soldiers&apos; votes overseas, and the votes willbe counted in the High Commissioner^ office in. London.   The  ballot boxes will bein charge of  special returning  officers,  who will be  assigned, with  credentials,  toCommissioners in France and the British Isles.    Questioned in the  House of Commons  with  regard  to  Sir  Edward  Kempe&apos;sstatement that the Military Service Bill would be  enforced without delay, Sir robert borden replied that the statement had been correctly reported.    The  Minister of Finance has agreed to provide 35 million dollars  to  meet the august commitments on account of the Imperial Munitions Board in  New  York on condition that the Bank of Montreal receives the 10 million  dollars due to it on theBoard&apos;s account  on  15th August.  The Dominion Governments monthly appropriation(of  25 millions) for September will thus be anticipated  by  20 millions.   With a  viewto supporting  the policy advocated by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in the matterof reducing commitments in Canada, the Minister of Finance now proposes  to relieve the War  Office of contracts for oats  and  flour.  For these, other markets are readilyto be found,  but any diminution of the munitions output wrould seriously dislocateindustry and  lead to discontent  in  labour circles  with political consequences  of an undesirable kind.   He therefore suggests that the funds  supplied  by the canadian government should be earmarked for munitions.  This question is being consideredby the Treasury, but  the Chancellor of  the Exchequer fears  that  in  the absence  ofother sources of supply it will not  be  possible to dispense with Canadian  oats and flour.    Idis Majesty&apos;s Government have suggested that the negotiations now proceeding between  the Canadian Government and certain  Canadian Railways should  be  madeto provide an  opportunity for obtaining the fullest  possible powers over the telegraphsystems  appertaining  to  these  railways for use  in connection with Imperial  orDominion Pacific and Atlantic cable services.    Under the new Income Tax Bill, which has  passed the House of Commons, -unmarried persons are to pay tax on incomes  above $1,500  and married persons on incomes above -$3,000.    The Hon.  R. Rogers, Minister of Public Works,  who came over in attendanceupon  Sir R. Borden at the recent Imperial War Cabinet and Imperial War Conferencemeetings, has resigned.   It  is understood  that he objects  to the  continuance  of negotiations for  the formation of a Union AVar Ministry.                              NEWFOUNDLAND.   The new session of the  General Assembly was opened by  the  Governor  on the15th, and its proceedings were adjourned to the 20th.   The Profits Bill will then  be-reintroduced ;  it is expected, that it wdll be passed without further opposition.   The Secretary of State for the Colonies has expressed his regret that the exigencies;of the shipping situation do not permit of  the allocation  of  any British steamers toNewfoundland for the purposes of  the Newfoundland fish trade ;  nor does he think-that  the Governments of Italy or Greece could divert tonnage for that purpose  unless they  decided  that fish is  essentially required  for feeding  their population.   It issuggested,  how7ever, that the  Government of Newfoundland may be able to  obtainneutral tonnage for transport of fish; the Shipping Controller will not object  to this being done, and in order  to assist  to this  end. he will  make an exception  in the
procedure regularly applied to Spaiu, by asking the Inter-Ally Chartering Executive toagree to the chartering of steamers of any nationality, if they can be spared,  to  carryNewfoundland fish to that country.                       AUSTRALIAN  COMMONWEALTH.    The Secretary of State for the Colonies, after  consultation with the Army Council, has replied to the Commonwealth Government concerning their proposals (vide Report No. 27) for the better recognition of Australian national sentiment in the organisation of the fighting formations and by the appointment of a  senior Australian officer at the War  Office.  He points out that the Australian Imperial force is organised in divisions composed exclusively of Australian troops, and  that most of: the Staff appointments are held by Australian  officers.   The Army Council expect  that, as the number of trained, officers increases, it will be possible to provide  a representative  proportion of Australian officers for Staff appointments inside and outside the Australian force ;  but they hope that the Commonwealth  Government do not wish to confine Staff appoint- ments on the Australian force to Australian officers, inasmuch as the Staff generally is regarded as an Imperial organisation in which British and Dominion officers should be interchangeable.  As regards the proposed  appobitment  of  a  senior Australian officer at the War Office, as  Sir  W. Birdwood, appointed  by   the  Commonwealth Government, already performs administrative duties of the  kind suggested, in close touch with the War Office, it is suggested that no further appointment is required, but, should the proposal be maintained, the Army Council, desires to be more fully informed as to  the duties which the proposed appointntent would carry.    On 17th August the Senate passed a resolution expressing approval and apprecia- tion of the statement made by the Secretary of State for the Colonies on 31st January, emphatically declaring that none of the captured German possessionsshall be returned, and furthermore  resolving that any proposal to restore captured colonies  in  the vicinity of Australia would be particularly distasteful and prejudicial  to the interests of the people of the Commonwealth and the future peace of the world.    Referring  to  the  Australian  Government/s request (vide Report No. 26) that  the Treasury should  authorise the issue of a  loan of 6,84O,0Q0Z. to meet extraordinary expenditure  up  to  the  end of the  current  year,  the Colonial Office replied on 16th August that after the fullest consideration the Treasury is unable to sanction the issue  of so large an amount.   With every desire to meet the wishes and needs of  the Commonwealth, it is prepared to assent  to a loan not exceeding  4,500,000Z. provided that the terms  of its issue  are approved and that no  further requests  for financial assistance are made before 1st April 1918.   Authority has been given to New South Wales to float another 3,000,000Z. on  similar conditions.    The Governor-General has enquired whether arrangements  can be  made  by  the United States Government for hospital  accommodation at-Panama, for the benefit of Australian troopships using the Canal route.  If preferred, the Australian Government is prepared  to establish  a hospital there.  (Vide also under  &quot; United States.&quot;)    There is further evidence of activity on the part of Japanese agents and financiers in regard to the nickel  mines of New Caledonia.  The gist of this  evidence was telegraphed to the Colonial Office by  the Governor-General on loth August, together with a renewal of his suggestion (vide Report  No. 26)  that the  matter  should form the subject of joint action by the British and French Governments  to prevent  thetransfer of these important mines to a Japanese Company.                               NEW ZEALAND.   The Governor-General reported on 15th August  that  a  question had been raised as to the right of the New Zealand Government  to  exercise  a  system of postal  and.telegraphic censorship in war time.  The censorship in New Zealand was established at the outbreak of  war, without  legislation  or  regulation, at the request  of  HisMajesty&apos;s Government ; the Government therefore desired to be informed by whatstatute, regulations  or  law the  censorship. is  exercised  in Great  Britain,   TheSecretary of  State for the Colonies  replied that  the  postal  censorship  in  Great
4                               SOUTH  AFRICA.   An intercepted telegram having shown, that  the agent of a Dutch firm at Durbanhas inspected and reported very  favourably on certain mines  in the Western CapeProvince containing - potassium nitrate, galena and asbestos, the  Colonial Office has brought  the matter to the attention of the.South African  Government and expressedthe opinion that it is highly undesirable that any but British  firms should,  obtaincontrol over the output of any of these  materials.  The Minister of Munitions pointsout  that the  control of asbestos  is a particularly important matter, because, sinceRussian  supplies were cut off, His Majesty&apos;s Government is compelled to rely moreand  more upon South  Africa and Rhodesia.   The Union Government have appointed a Commission to inquire into prices on theWitwatersrand,  and into the existence and extent of profiteering.   In this connection,and in view of the shortage of shipping, the Government are appealing for economy in consumption and the  use, whenever possible, of South African products.                                   LIBERIA.   On 18th August 98 German subjects, all men, wrere taken from  Monrovia by  theFrench warship &quot; Desaix &quot; for internment in France.                        PORTUGUESE  EAST  AFRICA.   Sir L.  Carnegie has  been  directed to draw  the  attention  of  the portuguese government once more to the  obstructive policy adopted by the local authorities  in portuguese East Africa in. preventing the recruiting of carriers for General NortheyVforce.  The Governor of Nyasaland recently reported that, since the  columns crossed the Rovuma river, 1,500  carriers previously recruited  in Portuguese territory havebeen  refused  permission  to  leave  and all  representations addressed  to  the localofficials have  produced no effect.  The authorities  appear to  be willing to allowrecruiting for General van Deventer&apos;s force.                                   JAMAICA.   The Foreign Office has informed His Majesty&apos;s representative at Havana that  theWar Office consider it advisable that  the  Government of Jamaica should undertake a recruiting  campaign in Cuba, inviting white and Creole British subjects to registerfor military service, if required, in Europe.   Black British subjects in Cuba shouldbe  enlisted for service -with  the Jamaica Labour Battalion  now being raised  for service in  France.                                  MAURITIUS.   The exchange problem between Mauritius and  the United  Kingdom (see ReportKo.  29) has  its parallel  in  the exchange  problem  between  Mauritius  and  India.Mauritius imports annually about 1,200,000Z. worth of essential supplies from  India.The   sugar exports  of Mauritius  are,  however,  urgently  needed  in the  United     3657--4                             BBritain is  authorised by  warrants issued under the general prerogative  power ofthe Grown, a power not created by Statute but recognised by Act  of Parliament(1908).  , General warrants have, been issued for  the  censorship of postal  correspon-dence with foreign countries.   For inland letters or telegrams special warrants,  as required, are occasionally issued.
Kingdom, and there is, consequently,  no return  trade  to  India to  keep up theexchange, while the United Kingdom is apparently also in great straits to find meansof effecting its payments in  India.  On 9th August  the Secretary of  State for theColonies communicated to the Governor a proposal from the Government of Indiato provide  a  loan of Rs. 1,500,000 a month, for August and September only,  ifMauritius could ship Rs. 500,000 a  month in  specie to India.   This  was the utmost to which the Indian Government could afford to  strain its currency resources.  the telegram suggested that the natural solution was  for Mauritius  to  pay its debt toIndia in sugar, the Government buying up as much as it required on the same terms as the Sugar Commission.   Sir  Hesketh  Bell replied on the 16th that the Colony Avasquite unable  to meet the situation by  shipments of  specie,  and unless  the  sugar commission could pay in India for part of the sugar received from Mauritius, he saw-no alternative but  selling enough  sugar in  India  to cover the imports. This mightincidentally require the provision of extra shipping by the Shipping Controller.  Inconclusion,  he urged that the  Government of  India might recognise the necessity forfeeding the large Indian population of Mauritius,  and the  United Kingdorn&apos;s need forsugar, by making a small extra  allotment of  Council Bills in order that the purchaseof Mauritius food supplies might be facilitated, and the whole of the  Mauritius  sugarcrop be sent to the Mother Country.MALTA.   AVith  reference to the entry under this heading in last Report, His Majesty&apos;representative at Algiers reports (18th August)  that there are many persons of Malteseextraction who are willing to serve in the French Army, provided that  assurances aregiven them (1) that such military service will not hwolve them in any permanentliability to French nationality, and (2) that they will  not be required to serve in theForeign Legion.
PART  II. FOREIGN  AFFAIRS.                         ALLIED  COMMON  AFFAIRS.    At the suggestion of the United  States Government, it is  proposed that a naval conference should be held in London on 4th September, at which  the Governmentsconcerned will  be  represented  by the naval officers whom they may appoint.   TheUnited  States Government have  appointed Admiral  Mayo and Vice-Admiral Sims.The  French,  Italian and Russian Governments  have been  requested to appoint representatives to this Conference. 1                                    FRANCE.    A  report to the  Department  of Information  by Mr.  W. A.  Gill describes. the political situation in the south of France generally as much  healthier in the cities than in Paris.  There has been a great creation of  new industries to take the place of those  destroyed  or  eliminated in  the north and east.   Lyons, for instance,  has increased its population by a third  since  1914.   The working classes are well paid and the  revolutionary movement has touched them far less than in Paris.  If there is restlessness it is more among the women than the men.  In the rural districts ; on the other  hand, pacifist  and  revolutionaiy  sentiments are  freely  expressed by  the women.   Agriculture has been vety much neglected by the politicians ; the politically unorganised peasant has had no chance of securing  exemptions ; the  women  are absolutely exhausted with the effort to keep the farms going, and their longing for. peace  gets communicated to their menfolk in the trenches, and might  constitute  a real danger if the Germans were to ,make  reasonably plausible proposals.  Both in town and country there is a general contempt for the Paris Government.    M. Albania met in,  Under Secretary for  Finance, has  been appointed  Under Secretary of State for Blockade.  The various Departments and Committees dealing with blockade questions will henceforward be located in one building.    A  conference to discuss the French Governments import prohibition lists has been arranged to take place in Paris on 28th August.                                   BELGIUM.   As a  sequel  to the recent  ministerial  changes,  a  Committee  of  War  andReorganisation has been constituted, comprising the Ministers  for  Foreign Affairs,the Interior, Finance, Colonies, Intenclance, and  M. Hymans.  The idea is  that  theCommittee should be in regular  attendance upon  the King, who will  preside over its meetings, remaining on Belgian territory, the rest of the  Government remainingat Havre.  The Committee only has powrers of initiative,  the decisions being  referredto the full  Cabinet before becoming effective.   For this  purpose  the  latter willassemble at short invervals, in Belgian territory, so that the King may preside.   No definite replies  have yet  been received by  the United Exports Council fromthe  Norwegian, Swedish  and  Dutch  Governments with regard  to Mr.  HooveFsproposals for diverting a  certain  proportion of their respective cereals cargoes inUnited ports to the purposes of  the Belgian Relief  Commission (vide Reports Nos. 28and  29).  Sir  C.  Spring  Rice  reports  that  the Dutch are  endeavouring to evadeMr. HooveFs conditions by negotiating with the  British  Government.  Mr. Lloover is determined that no ships shall sail  unless his terms are accepted  ; Sir C. Spring Riceconsiders that for the present it  is advisable to leave the matter entirely in the handsof the Americaus, who  are prepared to deal  with it  firmly and on lines  calculated to preserve a maximum of supplies indispensable to the Allies.
    The &quot; Deutsche Tageszeitung,&quot; of 14th August, states on the authority of its  war-correspondent, that there is much hostility to England in Belgium  owing  to Belgiancasualties caused by British air raids on Bruges, Ingelmunster, and other towns.                                    ITALY.   In a despatch dated 29th July, Sir R. Rodd says that, in spite of the absence of anyparticularly striking evidence of mutiny against public order,  he never remembers  atime when there was so much talk of the coming revolution, more particularly in those-prosperous  circles  where  neglect  of  public  duty has  naturally created a guiltyconscience.   On the whole Sir R. Rodd does  not think the country is ripe for anycollective revolutionary movement, but he draws attention to the incessant propagandaof the Socialists against the war, as supported only by the  privileged classes, and  tothe absence of any counteracting effort.  The Minister of the Interior, Signor Orlando,.is reported to think it more dangerous to check  this propaganda than  to leave itu.n contradicted.    In another recent despatch, Sir R. Rodd discusses  the  position  of the two  greatMasonic groups in Italy,  the  Grand  Orient and the lodges  of  the Scottish Ritual.The latter have throughout supported the war staunchly.  The former  at  first was-for the Avar, possibly under French influence.   But it is veiy  much under Giolittianinfluences, and more recently seems to have been used, as a medium of  his intrigues,by M.  Caillaux, avIio was at  the  same  moment  also  working away  at its  veryantipodes, the Vatican.   The programme M. Caillaux is said to be advocating in  Italy is a Latin, i.e.,  Italo-Franco-Spanish alliance, opposed to Great Britain and leaning on germany.    On 16th August the Foreign Office communicated to Sir R. Rodd the  summary ofa  Note  addressed to  the Italian  Ambassador  containing  a,  draft agreement whichmodifies in  certain particulars  the  financial agreement   of  22nd  March.   Thesemodifications have been  arrived  at  after  careful  consideration of a  memorandumhanded to the Chancellor of the Exchequer by Baron Sonnino on 2nd  August;  theyaffect (1)  purchases  by the  Italian Treasury payable from  British credits, and (2) thesale of  sterling exchange by the  Bank of Italy.  For the present, beginning  from 1st August 1917, the British  Treasury will  discount Italian  Government bills up  to,000,0001.  monthly for  specified expenses (other than expenditure  in America and.for exchange), and 1,500,OOOL monthly to provide for the sale of  sterling exchange bythe Bank of Italy.                                   GREECE.   The While Book issued by the Greek Government contains  documents whichthrow new light upon the relations betAveen the ex-King Constantine and the GermanErtiperor, and  upon the  surrender of  Eastern Macedonia to the Bulgarians.   on 7th August 1914, the ex-King telegraphed  to the Kaiser regretting that the  Frenchand British fleets prevented him  from mobilising his army at once, and compelledhim to proclaim a neutrality at variance Avith all his sympathies and  political views ;this neutrality, howeA^er, &quot; might be advantageous  to  the Emperor.&quot;   This telegram was sent in reply to one in  Avhich the  Emperor had appealed to  King Constantine to mobilise against their common enemy, the Slav, and  &quot; to take  all the  steps which heand the Emperor had so frequently discussed,&quot; or  else  be  prepared for  severance of.all bonds  between Germany and  Greece.   It  is Avorthy of  note  that  on 1st  of  Maythis year King Constantine  thought fit to send his Court Marshal to His Majesty&apos;minister at Athens  to express his injured surprise  that  Lord Hardinge should have referred to his frequent correspondence Avith the German Emperor, from Avhoin liehad received  only one letter (guaranteeing  restitution of Greek territory by  the bulgarians) since the Avar begun.    With  reference to  Air.  Crackanthorpe&apos;s suggestion (vide last  Report) as to  thedesirability of  bringing King Alexander out of  his present isolation and into touchwith the Allied Legations, he considers that it is not advisable to  postpone action inthe matter until the arrival  and presentation of Lord Granville.  The  Minister forForeign Affairs has expressed a wish  that  Mr. Crackanthorpe should take any early
-opportunity that may occur of seeing His Majesty formally.   His idea is to induce.His Majesty to emerge from  his  retirement,  and possibly to entertain at his. summerresidence, which would be a means of bringing the rival political elements into contact.   Upon the advice of  Mr. Crackanthorpe, M. Venizelos  has had an interview withthe United States  Minister (18th  August), and has explained the financial position andhis urgent  need of  a loan for military  purposes.   The United States Minister has expressed the opinion that his Government will entertain  the proposal, provided thatLondon and Paris  endorse it, and he is suggesting an Anglo-French-American loan.   The 1916 and  1917 classes have been called up for military training, to commencein the first week of September.   The  classes designated include refugees in old andnew Greece, Jews in the new territories and  Mussulmans.   The Greek General Stall estimates that when the mobilisation scheme  has been completely carried out the  Navy  will have a minimum strength of 8,000 men, of whom2,500 will be employed on coast  defences and as merchantmen gunners.   As regardsthe proposed British Naval Mission to Greece, the Admiralty  understand that theGreek Navy in commission will consist for the present only of destroyers, submarines and other small craft; this being so, they propose not to send a substantive  rank flag officer as head of the Mission (unless  required for political reasons), but to nominateCaptain Clifton Brown, assisted   by two other officers.  In addition, the Admiral in command of the Eastern Mediterranean Squadron will be directed to afford all possible assistance  to Greek warships  in training.    On  16th August  Mr.  Crackanthorpetransmitted  a communication to His  Majesty&apos;s  Government from  the  Minister of marine expressing the wish that  the  special knowledge of Commander R. Hendersonmight be placed  at the disposal of the Greek Navy ; the  xVdmiralty have  repliedregretting that it is not possible to  spare this officer&apos;s  services.   On the 21st he reported that the Minister  attaches great importance  to limiting  the powers with which the new Mission will be invested.   For the  purpose of  troop transport to Salonika via Itea-Bralo, the British militaryauthorities desire  to establish a small British base at the Pineus, and Mr. Crackan-thorpe was  instructed on 18th August to obtain the  consent of the Greek Governmentthereto, and  to the  use of the Itea-Bralo road.  On the  21st he reported that  the.Greek Government have no objection  to offer, but draw attention to the great shortageof rolling stock on  the Piraeus  Plate  line caused by Allied requisitions on the same.    The Greek Minister in  London has drawn the attention of  the Foreign Office to theserious state of affairs in Janina  and  surrounding districts.  The Italian promise of evacuation, made  at the Paris Conference, has not been fulfilled, on the  ground thatthere was still one French officer left in Thessaly.  Meanwhile the local  Albanianpopulation  are being armed with rifles and bombs  by  the Italians,  with the idea,apparently, that they should rise immediately after the Italian evacuation to proclaimannexation  of this part of Epirus to Albania, and that a pretext might then be affordedfor Italian reoccupation.    The Italian  Government, on its side, is concerned with, regard to  French intentions as to the Koritza  district,  where an Albanian  autonomy or &quot; republic &quot; under French&quot; military protection &quot; was proclaimed in December last.   Reports have reached Rome,firstly to the effect that the French mean to hand the district  over to the Venizelists,which  Baron Sonnino considers contrary to  existing agreements  about Albania ; and secondly, that they  mean to give it to Essad, which would be particularly displeasing to Italy.    The Greek Minister in London has complained  to His Majesty&apos;s Government that the  number&apos; of Italian troops  at  Corfu has been  increased, notwithstanding the decision recorded  by  the  Paris Conference,  Mr.  Crackanthorpe  reports that on 13th August there were 1,-150&apos; Italian  and 1,250 French troops on. the island.    Two-thirds  of the houses  wdthin  the Avails of Salonika, including  practically the whole  of the business  quarter,  were destroyed by fire  on 18th and  19th August, and  about  80,000 people are left  homeless  and destitute.   His Majesty&apos;s  Consul- General says that there will be  urgent need of provisions from  abroad to replace the stocks destroyed,  and that it will be necessary to deport most of the population.  An expression  of His Majesty&apos;s Governments deep sympathy  and willingness to assist in. relief measures, has been conveyed to the Hellenic Government.                                    SERBIA.    On 15th August representatives of the  Serbian Crown Prince and of the Serbian- Government  proceeded  to Valona, upon the invitation, of the Italian  General Officer     3657-4                              C
Commanding in Albania, to assist at the consecration by the Archbishop ox Belgrade&apos;of a memorial to the Serbian soldiers who died  at Valona during the retreat.    A. noteworthy feature of recent weeks has been the growing recognition in italy of the need for an accommodation  between Italian and Jugoslav aspirations,  and. arealization of the desirability for Italy of a  strong Jugoslav State as a buffer against.Germans  and  Magyars.   The  Intelligence  Bureaids  Weekly Report on  Serbia andMontenegro quotes significant passages from the &quot; Corriere della  Sera &quot;  and from the&quot;Unita &quot;  in support of this view.  Even more effective in bringing about an under-standing  between the two nations will  have been  the  chivalrous action of General.Ferrero mentioned above.    The fire at Salonika may  effect the  decision of the Serbian Government withregard to  establishing their quarters there.                          ENEMY ALLIED  AFFAIRS.   In a recent interview with General Barnardiston the King of Spain expressed theopinion that, unless the union of the Central Powers can be broken up (perhaps by aseparate peace with Austria, which he seemed to. think possible) the war would go on for a long  time.  The Austrian military and  economic  situation was, he believed,very bad.   But Germany, helped by the Rumanian harvest, might go on  for anothertwo years.   A report received by the State Department at Washington from a reliable source states that there is  no chance of Austria making a separate peace ; but thatshe is bringing all possible pressure to bear on Germany to put an end to  the war.   A report, forwarded from  Berne, states that a conference of ministers  and highmilitary officers was held at Vienna  on 9th  August  under  the presidency  of theAustrian  Emperor.   Germany&apos;s  latest  peace  proposals were  the chief topic ofdiscussion.   Another report from Austrian  sources  asserts that negotiations are proceeding between Germany and Austria-Hungary for a  mutual preferential tariff.   According.to this report Austria is opposed to the idea of  an economic war, or to any treaty thatwoidd prevent her from resuming trade relations with the Allies.   Switzerland is obtaining considerable supplies of mineral and lubricating oil fromthe Central  Powers, mostly from  the Galician  fields.   The output of these is about45 per cent, of the peace production, but  is apparently sufficient to leave a surplus.for export after supplying Austria&apos;s  needs.   The Rumanian  output,  estimated at30,000 tons  a month, goes mostly to Germany.   A report in the &quot; Vossische Zeitung&quot; of the 19th states that Count Bernsdorff hasbeen appointed Ambassador at Constantinople.                              GERMAN  AFFAIRS.   In last weelPs Report reference was made to the falling off in Germany&apos;s milk and meat production and to the  bad harvest prospects.  A further report from  the samesource confirms this information and adds that one of the causes for the deterioration of German crops has been the cultivation of comparatively worthless crops due to theGovernments inept  fixing  of prices  (the German genius for organisation appears tohave had. a disastrous effect upon agriculture).  The report is consistently gloomy. Itasserts that there are only 12 million pairs of  boots in Germany ;  that 70,000 people in Berlin are living on what they can steal from the countryside fields ; and. that thetrade unions are preparing for a general strike to commence without warning.   . An article in the &quot; Berliner Tageblatt &quot; of 14th August  states that many cattlewill have to be slaughtered for want of fodder.  It objects to the  proposed raising ofthe price of milk and butter, as this would induce farmers to feed more cows than arerequired with food fit for human consumption.  Milk, it  says, should be reserved formothers, babies and invalids.   A million  cows would proAade enough for  these, andafter  providing for the butter supply 10 or 20 per cent, of  the remaining cattle mightbe killed for meat.    The  German  wireless  of  18th  August  reports the  appointment  of  GeneralScheuech to be Chief of the War Bureau at Berlin, vice General Groener. who  is-.appointed to a Divisional command.
1.1   In the &quot; Kolnische Volkszeitung &quot; of  14-th August it is  reported that, in a recentinterview&quot; given by Herr Michaelis to the editor of the &quot; Neue Baclische Lancleszeitung,&quot;the Chancellor declared fiscal exploitation to be  unavoidable in the case of newproducts, such  as  nitrogen.   The  State, he  said, will not  create  monopolies  in industrial and commercial products except in the  last resort, but will he compelled tofind sources of revenue other than direct war taxes on incomes and propert3r.   A report, received through diplomatic channels, states that at a dinner recentlygiven in Berlin, at which Count Bernsdorif  was  present, an officer named Hoffmann,on Ludendorff&apos;s staff, asserted that  Germany would have been  compelled  to  makepeace months ago had  she not received vahiable help in war materials  from Sweden.If these supplies were uow cut off, lie thought that  her defeat was inevitable withinthe next  four months.   He did  not believe in the  possibility of  the  country  beingrecbuced by starvation, but only by the wastage of human lives and war material.   An  unconfirmed report, forwarded from Rotterdam  on the 20th, states that theGerman railway workers have declared a general strike and are demanding a republic and the abolition of German militarism.                      AUSTR0-HUNGARIAN  AFFAIRS.   A German wireless message of 21st August states  that Herr Wekerle has beenappointed Prime Minister of Hungary.                                  HOLLAND.   The Dutch Minister at Berlin has received instructions to lodge a formal protest against the recent violation of Netherland territorial waters by two German aviatorsand a German torpedo host.   The Dutch Minister  for Foreign Affairs has raised nonobjection to the conditionsnamed  by the British  and  French Governments  with  reference to the proposed transfer to the  Dutch flag of six German  ships in Dutch East  Indian  ports.  he suggests,  however,  that  in  order  to expedite  transport  for  the  Belgian ReliefCommission it would be wrell not to wait  for the ex-German ships, wdiich are not ready for sea, but to use equivalent Dutch tonnage.   Sir W. Townley reports (21st August)  that in spite of prolonged negotiations, no progress has been made with regard to the  supply of coal  to  Holland by Germany.The Germans insist that, if  more than 100,000 tons are  wanted, Dutch miners mustbe sent to produce it from the German mines.  The situation is serious for Holland.                                SWITZERLAND.   His Majesty&apos;s Minister  at  Berne having conveyed  a warning  to friendly Swissbanks  as to the  possibly  unpleasant results  of  a Swiss  loan to Germany  (vide report No. 2S), the Minister for Foreign Affairs, greatly disturbed  thereby, enquire whether  this warning had  been given under instructions.   He said that it might result in wrecking the German-Swiss negotiations, and if it did, the Swiss Governmentwould be unable to obtain coal and might be compelled to refuse accommodation forinterned prisoners.   He admitted  that the proposed  loan to  Germany was under the auspices of  the  Swiss Government.  The gist of the transaction  is, that instead of paying 200 francs a ton for German coal, the Swiss will be able to pay 90 francs  a tonand lend Germany the balance  of 110 francs for the period of the war. Sir H. Rumboldsuggests that, instead of  incurring the resentment of the Swiss  people  by increasing their difficulties in this emergency, it might be  advisable  to  ask for equal facilities in the slnvpe of a substantial loan.  The French Ambassador understands that the swiss government  would  entertain  proposals, and  he  has  therefore  suggested  to hisGovernment that the  best solution of the question would be an Anglo-French  loan tosupport exchange and melt Allied  commitments  in Switzerland.   The new German  Swiss Convention was  signed on the 20th August, to remain inforce until 13th April 1018.
                                    SWEDEN.    The Swiss Minister for Foreign Affairs has  informed the French Ambassador  at berne that he understands  the  Swedish Government  intend to raise  the  submarinequestion at the Conference of  neutrals.   The Norwegian Minister for Foreign Affairsstates that discussion at the Conference (if it  should  be  convened) will  be strictlyconfined to matters of international  law, as indicated in the published programme,and that the  American  blockade policy will  not be  discussed ; Norway declines  toconsider proposals for  common action  in  this  matter.   The Italian Minister  atChristiania has reported that the object of the Swedish Government is to secure thiscommon action.   Questioned  on the subject by Sir  E. Howard on  the 17th August.the Swedish. Minister for Foreign Affairs  said that His Government have abandonedall idea of  discussing any matters connected with the prosecution of the war, includingthe submarine question.   The Conference is intended  to be merely preliminary and.to discuss  neutral rights and interests  after the war.  Sir A. Hardinge has beenconfidentially informed  that the Spanish Minister for Foreign Affairs is  opposed  tojoining in  any  Conference likely  to   be  obnoxious  to  the  British or  american governments.    On 17th August the Swedish Minister for Foreign Affairs informed Sir E. Howard,in reply to enquiries, that he had not yet received any communication from the UnitedStates concerning American imports into Sweden.  Sir E. Howard  had  advised theForeign Office two days before that  the whole question of  a general Allied  policy ofembargoes on  Swedish  imports might  be  seriously prejudiced, and  the blockaderendered ineffective, by independent action on the part of Russia.  He  instanced thefact  that the  Russian Minister was  endeavouring to  make an agreement  wherebyRussia would  obtain certain munitions in return for sending 20,000 tons of  oilcake to sweden.   Other similar  arrangements are also under  discussion.  Sir E. Howard andhis American colleague  spoke to the  Russian Minister on the subject on the 15th andadvised delay, pending consultation  between  the Allied Governments.   In  thisconnection it, is to be  noted that large quantities of Danish meat, eggs and butter arebeing exported to  Sweden.  Sir  E. Howard, advises that no meat should be allowed tobe thus  exported  unless Danish  meat exports to  Germany are correspondingly reduced ; as regards eggs and butter, he thinks all Swedish imports of  these articlesare locally  consumed, so that  Danish exports to Sweden would appear to be likely toreduce the  quantities  that might otherwise go to Germany.   As regards the Fish agreement, the renewal of  which has recently been  under negotiation with the Swedish Minister in  London,  the Swedish Government have declined to agree to the immediate total cessation of all fish and fish products exportsto Germany and to give statistics of  such exports  since 1st June 19.17.  This being so, His Majesty&apos;s  Government have  intimated  their&apos; unwillingness to proceed with negotiations for  the renewal of this agreement, and have suggested to Sir E. Howardthat the facts  should  be made public in Sweden, so  that the Governments responsi-bility for future shortage of food may be clearly recognised.   Sir E. Howard advisesthat steps should be taken to reduce  the quantity of  Norwegian herrings  to be sold.to Sweden.                                   NORWAY.   Bearing on the general subject of  Russian exports  to  Scandinavia, above  noted,.Sir M. Findlay, reports (21st August) that  127 tons  of  Russian hemp were recentlyimported  by Norway  in  one week.   He  has drawn the attention  of  the RussianCharge d&apos;Afraires to the matter, who concurs in recognising the importance of stoppingthese imports, in conformity with the Allies&apos; general blockade policy, and  will  advise his Government accordingly.   Sir M. Findlay, reporting on the  general  position  of  Norvvay&apos;s food supply(17th August), states  that the annual imports of  nitrogenous foods (13,000  tons)could be  dispensed  with if  the  Norwegians  consumed more of their own fish and milk.  In the matter of edible fats, the country would  be self-supporting if exportsof milk were stopped and fish oils  more  extensively used.   The country, however,needs large imports of  cereals and fodder stuffs from overseas, and this fact places theAllies in  a position  to  exercise irresistible pressure, and to insist  on the cessation
of all  food exports from  Norway to the  enemy.   His  Majesty&apos;s  Minister  advises, therefore, that pressure be confined to commodities of the carbohydrate class.    In order to induce Norway to draw her supplies of imported meat from adjoining Scandinavian countries, His Majesty&apos;s Government have  instructed Sir M. Findlay to denounce  the Provision  Merchants&apos;  Agreement and the corresponding arrangement with the Food Commission, in so far  as it relates to meat, at the same time explaining that this step is necessitated by the  complete change which  has taken  place  in the situation since the Agreement was  made.  The &quot;denunciation of the Agreement will take  effect in three  months, dating  from 20th  August :  thereafter His Majesty&apos;s Government will consider the question of  future facilities in the light of  the  existing situation.  Sir R. Howard advises that to make this measure effective  in the direction desired it  will  be  advisable to  limit the facilities  for sending Iceland mutton to Norway.                                  DENMARK.   The delegates who  went recently  to Berlin to  discuss the coal supply  questionhave  returned  to Copenhagen.   They report  that  Germany is  not in a position  tosupply the quantities  of  coal originally promised, and they therefore expect that theGerman  Government will agree to give safe conducts for Danish ships  to bring thenecessary supplies from Great Britain, which they estimate at 100,000 tons monthly.The  Danish  Government points out  that,  as  the  stoppage  of fodder  imports  intoDenmark is likely to increase the amount of Danish tonnage employed in the interestsof the Allies, they have a right to expect that the export of coal  from Great britain should be increased to 150,000 tons a  month, and that the supply of tonnage requiredfor carrying it should be  authorised under the conditions  applied  to vessels already engaged  in this traffic.   The Minister  for Foreign Affairs has  handed  to Mr. Guraey a  memorandum setting forth  all  the facts  of Denmark&apos;s  difficult position,  and  citing figures andarguments to prove that His  majesty&apos;s Government  are  not justified in regardingDenmark as a base of supplies- for the enemy, or  in cutting off her imports of fodderstuffs.   On 17th August Mr. Gnrney reported that a notice to farmers had been issued bythe Victualling Committee, to  the effect that, in the absence of maize for pig-feedingand to preserve  grain  for human food, it  is  necessary  for them, to slaughter three-quarters  of their sows and not to breed from  the rest.   The  immediate result of this measure has been that  Germany has arranged to purchase 15,000  tons of bacon andpork,  in addition to her regular quota,  in return for supplying -100 tons of  petroleum.On receipt of this information, His Majesty&apos;s Government instructed Mr. Gurney that every possible  effort should  be  made to  dissuade  the Danish  Government  fromsanctioning  exports on such  a scale  to Germany.   With, this object  in view, HisMajesty&apos;s Government are prepared to guarantee a  fixed  price  for Danish bacon  ofthe best quality, with a sliding scale for lower grades, on  condition that the danish government will guarantee delivery to Great Britain of a specified  proportion of thecountry&apos;s  surplus produce for a definite period.                                     SPAIN.   The instigators of strikes and  sabotage  in  Spain have  proved themselves to belacking  in  staying  power  and  organisation.  After  the arrest of the  leadingrevolutionaries at Madrid, the proclamation  of martial law and  the execution  of  fourpersons implicated in train-wrecking at Bilbao, the miners, strikers,  and agitatorsappear  to  have  been  rapidly convinced   that their position was untenable.  TheGovernment were glad, on the whole, of an  opportunity of putting an end  to  a stateof unrest which,  had  it been prolonged, might have  become seriously  dangerous.On the 15th Sir A. Hardinge, passing through Bilbao on his way  from Sautander to madrid, expressed the opinion that confidence and order were rapidly being restored.There were general strikes at Santander, Carthagena, Rio rPinto, Corunna,  and other   ;;C57- -i                             D
places, but the large cities (including Barcelona and Saragossa) showed no inclinationto oppose the Governments military forces.  On the IGth railways  and factories hadresumed working.  At Bilbao there were disorders and a number of casualties on the night of the 16th, and one of the town&apos;s two  blast furnaces was  destroyed.   On the-.19th His Majesty&apos;s Consul reported that conditions had become normal, and  that theminers  wotdd return to  work  on the following day.  On  the 20th  the  militaryauthorities issued  an order  calling  for  the  surrender of all  arms, under severepenalties.  His Majesty&apos;s  Consul at Barcelona draws  attention  to the report, widelycirculated and commonly  believed, that the Allied Governments have spent money infomenting these disturbances.  At the same time  Sir A. Hardinge states that  there-is increasing evidence  of German instigation  of the  troubles  in  Bilbao.   For  a.different reason, there would also appear to have been a certain amount of Frenchsympathy with  the Spanish revolutionists&quot;.  An article by Herve has produced an unfortunate effect on the Spanish Government ;  furthermore, a  French subject namedBreal,  chief  of the French propaganda  service, has  been arrested  for addressingstrikers at Bilbao, and another French resident expelled from Corunna.    Negotiations are proceeding with  the  Spanish Ambassador in  the matter of theCortina agreement.   The  Spanish Government  contend that, in return for permittingthe free export of iron ore to Great Britain, His Majesty&apos;s Government should deliverBritish  coal in Spam.  The British Governments position  is that  Spain should sendher own, cr  chartered, ships  to fetch the coal, just  as England  sends  ships to fetchthe iron.  It has been made clear to the Spanish Ambassador that it  is for  Spain to-arrange the matter of transport for such supplies of coal as she requires.                                     CHINA.    According to a report forwarded  by Mr.  Alston  on 14th August,  the Chinese-Government propose to embark  upon considerable borrowing operations,  includingthe  &quot;Currency  Reform&quot; loan  of  10,000,0001. and a  further loan,  of unspecifiedamount,  for  &quot;administrative&quot;  purposes.    His   Majesty&apos;s  Government  considerit   highly   undesirable  that  this  tendency  should  be  encouraged,  and  have therefore suggested joint action with the  United  States at Peking, to induce  theChinese  Government to moderate their requirements.   Sir C. Spring  Rice has been instructed to point out that, if the Chinese Government persist in their demands,  theonly Allied country that can find the money is Japan, and the transaction would givethat Power a predominant influence, in Chinese affairs, unless a financial group wereorganised in the United States to participate in such advances. (The Chinese Govern-ment are particularly anxious to secure American participation).  As far as the actualposition  in China is concerned, His Majesty&apos;s Government consider that the finances of  the Chinese Government should now be  in a more advantageous situation than formany years past, owing to a,combination  of favourable circumstances, e.g., the rise inthe value of silver, remission of indemnities, increase in import tariff, &amp;c, and  that.borrowing on any large scale is therefore  unnecessary.    With reference to the disposal of the ex-enemy shiyjs in Chinese ports, His MajestyVAmbassador at Tokio has been  instructed  to  ask  the Japanese Government for  thepresent  not to make or  support any  offers  to  purchase them; pending the ChineseGovernments reply to  the  British  Governments offer to  buy all the vessels, whichwas communicated  to Japan last April.  It  is  the intention of His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment, if  and  when this purchase  is  completed, to divide the vessels  equally with japan and the United States, but in that case they would propose that  the JapaneseGovernment should agree to allow their share of the tonnage  to  be used during  the war for  purposes of European trade.   On  the 20th August,  however,  Mr. Alston was informed that the Chinese Government Government had decided not to sell the ships.but to keep them and charter them to the Allies.  Mr. Alston  has urged the Cabinetto reconsider this decision, pointing out the obvious advantages of an  immediate salefor cash.    Mr. Alston considers that there may be difficulties  in the way of  a  general  agree-ment betAveen all the Allies concerned in  regard  to  the  proposed  postponement ofChina&apos;s  idemnity for live years  without interest.   He  and   his Japanese  colleague-jforesee that the Russian Government, and  possibly  the Italian, may not consent to this
arrangement.   He  suggests  that, in the event  of  difficulties  being  raised,  he beauthorised to inform  the Chinese Government that Great Britain will in any  casewaive payment.   His Japanese colleague has ashed for similar instructions.   On 21st August a representative of the Premier and  the  Foreign Office  asked mr. Alston whether His Majesty&apos;s Government would regard with favour an offer byChina to send troops to the war.   The suggestion was confidential and unofficial.                                     SIAM.   The Siamese Minister for Foreign  Affairs has  unofficially  suggested  to  HisMajesty&apos;s representative at Bangkok that, if feasible, it would be expedient to send allinterned Germans  back  to Germany.  There are about  200 of them ;  the gain toGermany  of the males  of military age  among  them,  would  be; unimportant, ascompared with  the commercial injury which German interests would suffer by  their removal  to  Europe.   Mr. Lyle enquires  whether the idea can  be entertained orwhether His Majesty&apos;s Government consider internment in India to be preferable.                                    BRAZIL.   The Brazilian  Government having  requested information (for the protection oftheir merchant vessels) as to the areas patrolled by British warships in South. Americanwaters, Sir A. Peel has  been directed to state in reply  that  the  Admiralty offer noobjection, subject to the approval of the United States Government, but they considerthat the risk  of  communicating secret route  instructions to  Brazilian vessels is not justified so long  as the pro-German Commandant  Mulier  dos Reis remains in any wayconnected with the Brazilian Lloyd service.   Negotiations  have  been  practically, although not definitely, concluded between the brazilian  and French Governments whereby France  will buy about  a year&apos;s coffeesupply (between  two  and three million bags) from. Brazil on the understanding thatthe ex-German ships carrying this coffee will subsequently be chartered to the UnitedStates for the purpose of transporting  troops to France.   Sir A. Peel also understandsthat the French Government have guaranteed the  payment  due to the State of SaoPaolo for the  6,000,000Z.  worth of coffee requisitioned by Germany at Hamburg.                                   MEXICO.   On 21st August Mr. Cummins reported the publication of statements in the MexicanPress, to the effect that a United States loan of $250,000,000 is practically certain, as president Wilson has assured American Bankers that such a loan will have his moral support.   Similar statements having appeared in the American Press, Sir O. Spring-Rice reports (22nd)  that, while the State -Department does not wish  to antagoniseCarranza by refusing him money, they  are confident that no American Bank will lendhim any unless assured of something more than mere  acquiescence on the part of theUnited States Government.                                  HONDURAS.   In reply to an invitation issued by the Government of Costa Rica to the CentralAmerican Republics, for a Conference to re-consider the Washington Treaties of 1907,the Government  of  Honduras  has proposed  that the  Conference  should first of  allconsider the question of a Union of  Central  American Republics.  At  a publicmeeting held  on 14th August  at  Amapala to discuss this proposal, the tone of the speeches delivered was distinctly hostile to the United States.
                               UNITED  STATES.   In a memorandum  on Anglo-American relations, Sir W. Wiseman declares  thatthe situation is not satisfactory and  that we are  drifting towards  serious misunder-standings which may even lead to deadlock between the Governments, due mainly to lack of  information.  What is necessary, in his  opinion, is  that the Allied demands for help should be presented in a co-ordinated  form and their necessity for the purposeof carrying on the war made intelligible to the public ; but it is even more particularlynecessary that the Autocrat-President should himself be kept more closely informed of what is in our mind from day to day, and that the most capable and distinguishednaval and military officers should be sent over for that purpose.   In one of a series of  interviews between Lord Northcliffe and Colonel House (10thto 14th August), the latter laid stress  on the  necessity for placing Mr.  McAdoo in aposition to make it perfectly clear to Congress that the money of the American people is not being used to benefit Morgans, who, in  the  eyes  of  Democracy in the UnitedStates, stand for Wall Street and the dominion of the almighty dollar.  Colonel Houserenewed his suggestion that a Liberal politician of distinction, e.g., Lord Reading,should  be  sent  on a  general  mission in connection with war finance.   In  military matters also  he  thought that,  as American soldiers in France write home only aboutthe French Army, more should be done to remove popular ignorance concerning whatGreat Britain has  really  done and  is  doing.  To this  end  British officers of highdistinction and war experience  should be sent to  Washington.    He also urged thatGeneral Smuts should come out and speak in the Western States.    One of  the ex-German ships has been fitted with  Edison&apos;s apparatus for makingvessels unsinkable, the efficacy of which is to  be tested, by torpedoing the vessel, thisweek.    Sir G. Spring Rice reported  on 18th  August that the President was consideringthe question of a general embargo on exports to neutral European countries,  and thatin the opinion of the Licensing Bureau, of the Department  of Commerce he may be&quot; expected to take favourable action at any moment.&quot; but some weeks  are likely toelapse before any additions are made to the list of  prohibited exports.  Meanwhile, a regular propaganda is  being  worked from Scandinavia,  through the mails, giving aharrowing account of the food conditions there, for the purpose of creating a publicopinion against any embargo on foodstuffs.    On 15th August Mr. McAdoo informed, the party leaders  in Congress  that it willbe necessary to authorise an additional 6,000 million dollars for war expenditure(including new loans to the Allies) to  30th June  1918.   A Committee of the  house will discuss the situation on or about 25th August.   It is expected  that 4,000 millionswill be raised by a loan at a rate not exceeding 4- per cent.    Mr Royden reports,  for the information of the Food Controller  (16th August) thatthe steady rise in the prices of food, especially sugar and packing-house products, is causing grave dissatisfaction, and anxiety in the United States, where public opinion is tending  to oppose loans to the Allies  on the ground that they serve to put up pricesagainst  home  consumers.  Mr. Hoover strongly urges  that the  operations of theWheat Commission should be extended to cover all  food  purchases in the UnitedStates  and West  Indies, and that the  other Allies  should  join the Anglo-Americanpurchasing association  so as to check competition and control prices at the sources ofproduction.    The United States  Governments policy  in  the matter of  the neutrality  of thePanama Canal zone, as laid clown by the Proclamation of 23rd May, has  been furtherexplained  in a Memorandum  handed to His Majesty&quot;s Ambassador  by the state department. The Department regrets that it is unable to sanction the unlimited useof the dry  docks  and  . repair shops at Balboa  by  British warships, as this would constitute  an infringement of  the peculiar status of the Canal which the  United states are   bound  to  maintain.  In the  opinion of the Department,  the Canal and  itsapproaches should not be made a rendezvous  for belligerent ships or a  base of navalequipment and  repairs.  Sir C.  Spring Rice has pointed out that  if differentiation is exercised in favour of United States vessels, it would be to the disadvantage of  GreatBritain in  a matter  of vital importance to the war. . He is informed  by the  state department that  instructions have  been given to the Canal authorities to give allpossible facilities  to British transports.
                          THE SHIPPING SITUATION.    Lord Northcliffe reports (loth August) that Mr. Hughes has protested vehementlyragainst any seizure by the United States Government of the 14 ships now building inthe  United Slates for Australia.   These  ships,  he says, are the property of  theCommonwealth, and, if the United  States confiscates them, it will be regarded as an&quot;unfriendly act.    Mr. Royden  rej)orted on 18th August that the Shipping Board are considering the advisability of assuming control over all chartering of neutral vessels, under conditionssimilar to those adopted by the Inter-Allied&apos; Chartering  Committee in London ; at  thesame time  they propose to appoint representatives  on that  Committee, and to invitethe British Government to be represented on their Board.  The question of the futureownership of  ships now under construction in United States  yards is not yet settled.The Board is well-disposed, but strong political influences are at work in the directionof confiscation.    The Germans have refused, to supply any more shipbuilding materials to Norwegianyards, their object being  to keep  down  the  output of tonnage.  This being so, SirM. Findlay again urges the expediency of offering to supply Norwegian builders withmaterials from  America in sufficient  quantity  to keep their yards fully employed.Such an offer  would do much to  remove all ground for  the idea that Norway, with abetter record  than her neighbours, is  being harshly treated by the Allies ;  it wouldalso inflict  permanent  injury on Germany in the Norwegian market.   The tonnagerequired to carry these materials would probably only be a small  part of  the amountsaved by the restrictions placed  on  Norway&apos;s food imports.    An article  in &quot; Die Post,1&apos;&apos; discussing the effect of the submarine  campaign on  theshipping situation, places  the monthly reduction of tonnage available for British,  seatraffic at 950,000 ;  after allowing for all known losses and gains, it estimates that  thetonnage available on 1st February,  exclusive of army transports and auxiliary cruisers,was 10,750,000 tons, and that this  had been reduced to 7,000,000  on  1st July.   by 1st October, at this rate, there will be 5,500,000 tons left (counting  American ships),and  on  1st   January  .1918,  4,000,000.   It  places  the  minimum  required  for england&apos;s war needs at 6,000,000 to 7,000,000, and thus concludes that Germany&apos;sgoal is in sight.   An  official announcement, signed by the  Chief  of the AdmiraltyStaff, was published on 21st August, stating that &quot; the total amount of  enemy cargo&quot; space sunk by the military measures of the Central  Powers during the first six months&quot; of unrestricted U-boat warfare,&quot;  is 5,495,000 British register tons.    According to information given by a  German  naval  officer to  a member of  theUnited States  Legation at  Berne, Germany&apos;s submarine dosses have been heavy,  but have been balanced, by the rate of production.  From Zeebrugge alone six submarines were lost during the last three weeks of June.    Finding it impossible  1o  supply Japan with shipbuilding materials, as stipulatedhy  the  Japanese  Government  in  return for  the  allocation of  tonnage for Alliedpurposes, His  Majesty&apos;s Government have  decided  to  abandon  further negotiationsfor the acquisition of Japanese vessels, and to  leave the whole  question to  be  dealtwith by the United States.   Sir C. Spring Pice  was informed  of  this  decision on21st August.   It is hoped that, in return for raw materials for shipbuilding,  theUnited States  Government may be  able to  secure Japanese tonnage  for use not onlyduring the war but afterwards, and that, having secured it, they will be in a position-to allocate an  increased number  of  American vessels for use by the Allies in Europeanwaters and to  raise no objection to Allied re-chartering of  the few Japanese vessels.that are now in their service.                          . . PEACE  DISCUSSIONS.   The reception  given to the Pope&apos;s peace programme has not been of a nature&apos;to encourage his Holiness in looking for  any immediately satisfactory result.  Even.the &quot; Vorwarts &quot; damns it with faint praise.  It admits that &quot; there is nothing in thePapal Note which  the German  Government can  describe  as  absolutely impossible &quot; ;it thinks that in  the end it will do good, because &quot;Lloyd George and Ribot will not&quot; be able to conceal much longer from their peoples that Germany is ready to make&quot; peace, and because every refusal of mediation  must weaken,  their position in  their
&quot;&quot;own land&quot;; but it concludes by  the oracular  declaration  that Germ any&apos;s only possible watchword is &quot; strong in defence and ready for  peace by agreement.&quot;  The-Pan-German Press is naturally contemptuous of what it describes  as  an &quot; Ententeintrigue.&quot;  The &quot; Tagliche  Rundschau &quot; &quot;declares that the  Pope&apos;s proposals amountto  asking  Germany  for  self-sacrifice  and  renunciation;  &quot; tire, only  suggestion&quot; favourable to Germany, i.e., that  she should recover her Colonies, is impracticable,&quot; as the Japanese are not likely TO  be influenced by the Pope.&quot;  The Catholic organ,&quot; Germania,&quot; considers that his Holiness could not have acted as he has done withoutpreviously consulting both groups of  Powers, and that it  affords, therefore,  a strikingproof of the very strong and widespread craving for peace.    His Majesty&apos;s Government have  instructed Count  de Salis to choose  a suitable-opportunity to point  out  to  the  Cardinal Secretaiw of State at  the Vatican that, intheir opinion, no progress is  likely to  be made by  any offers of  mediation until  the-Central Powers  and their Allies have definitely stated the objects for which they arelighting,  the  measure  of  restoration and reparation  which  they are  prepared  to concede,  and. the guarantees they are  prepared to  give for  the future.   Even  asregards Belgium, where they  have  admitted  their guilt, they have given no clearintimation of their intentions ; nor  have they ever  given  any  satisfactory  reply to -President  Wilson&apos;s Note.    At  the same time His Majesty&apos;s representative  at  the vatican has been instructed to state that His  Majesty the King  fully appreciates thelofty and  benevolent intentions  which have  prompted his  Holiness  to make thesepeace proposals, which  will  receive the closest attention,   The State Department atWashington recognises  the  need for careful consultation with  the Allies in framinga courteous reply to the Papal Note, which is considered  to have been prompted  byAustria.   Mr. Lansing expects that the United States Government will not participate-in  any joint  note  of  the Allies,  but will reply independently  on similar lines.The President  is annoyed  that  the  Vatican should have  published this pencemanifesto  at  a  time when  the United  States Government are doing their utmost to combat pacifist intrigues ; this annoyance is clearly  reflected by the  resolutionintroduced in the Senate on 16th August wdiich assumes that &quot;  the President is in&quot; possession of all reliable information upon which any practicable course  for war or&quot; peace could be undertaken, wdien the time is appropriate for  such, a move.&quot;  At thesame time Americans  connected  with the Press and war propaganda consider it advisable  that the Papal Note should  be countered  by the  publication  of a clear statement which the Administration  could support, showing  precisely the origin ofthe war and the ideals of the Allies, without touching on their respective aims  and claims.  The Russian Minister for Foreign  Affairs regards the  Pope&apos;s overtures as&quot; purely  pro-German.&quot;  The  Spanish  Government  are apparently  annoyed at the vatican having  taken  action independently and  without consultation.   The ItalianGovernment  are reticent  as to  their views  in  the  matter,  pending  preliminary discussion, of the Allies&apos; reply.   The Austria]!. Minister at The Hague  is reported tohave declared that neither Berlin  nor Vienna were consulted concerning  the PapalNote ; at the same time, he thinks  it  may prove useful if  it  should help  to  delude theFrench and Italian peoples into the  belief  that  they have attained  their war  aimswith regard to Alsace-Lorraine and the Trentino, &amp;c, and so insist on peace.    With reference to the Stockholm Conference and  the published correspondence between the British  Prime  Minister  and Mr. Henderson,  the Russian  Minister forForeign Affairs informed  Sir G. Buchanan on the 15th that M. Nabokoff  had never-been authorised to sa,y  that  the Russian Government were opposed to the Conference:The Prime Minister begged Sir G.  Buchanan  and his Allied  colleagues  to  urge theirrespective Governments not to refuse passports to Socialist. Delegates for Stockholm.His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador observes  that while the Prime Minister and the Ministerfor  Foreign  Affairs were  opposed to  the meeting of the  Conference,  the RussianGovernment never intended that this attitude should  be publicly declared.  With aview  to  removing the misunderstanding created by M.  Nabokoffs  unauthorisedstatement, they  issued  a  semi-official communication  on 15th August, in which it isstated that the Russian.  Government has never thought of refusing passports to RussianSocialists, considering  an   International  Socialist Conference on questions  of  warand peace to be useful; at the same time they cannot recognise that such a Conferencecan settle  questions of state, decision in such matters being the sole prerogative of theAllied Governments.    In reply, the Foreign Office  explained the British governments position, as set forth  in the  Henderson correspondence  and in the House of Commons,observing that the cables to Russia had evidently  conveyed a false impression of  thePrime MiuisteFs statements,   M.  Nabokoff  had  never said,  nor  had  the  Prime
J9Minister, that the Russian Government were opposed to the Conference, but that they regarded it &quot; as a  party concern and its  decision  as  in  no way binding upon theirliberty  of action,&quot; a statement  explicitly authorised by  the Minister for ForeignAffairs.  Incidentally, Sir G. Buchanan was instructed so point out, if necessary, andin the  event  of the Russian  Government requesting that the  Allied governments should allow  Socialists to go to Stockholm, that public opinion in England, France,Italy, and America is entitled  to consideration as well as in  Russia.   An Italian official communication  published at  Rome on 15th August announcedthat passports would not be granted to Italian Socialists to go to Stockholm.   Writing in the &quot;Social Demokraten&apos;&apos; of 14th August, M. Branting expressed theopinion that  the  refusal of  the Allied  Governments to allow Socialists to  go to stockholm would have far-reaching consequences and might prove to be a politicalmistake  of  the first order,   placing the. Allied  Governments  in an unfavourableposition.   Much  will  depend,  be says,  upon  the  results of  the  Allied SocialistConference which meets in London oii 2Sth August.  lie, considers it certain that thefundamental  international ideal underlying  the  Stockholm  Conference  cannot  beoverthrown by a refusal to issue passports.  Mr.  Huysmans, who has been  invited bythe  Independent  Labour Party  to attend the Allied Socialist  Conference on 28thAugust, has expressed great indignation at the British Governments refusal to issuepassports for Stockholm.   In conversation  with  Sir E. Howard (to  whom he hasapplied for facilities to land in England),  he stated that  another winter of war would prove disastrous to the people of Belgium, and that for this reason, if for no other, he desired that some basis  for peace negotiations should speedily be found.    Social democrats  representing  the  Central Powers are  to meet in Conference atVienna on 29th August.    Information has  been  received,  coming  from an official German source,  thatGermany is  prepared  to  discuss  as peace  terms the  evacuation of Belgium andNorthern France,  and   a rectification  of the  Alsace-Lorraine frontier in favour  ofFrance, receiving  compensation from Russia  in Courland.   An  intimation in this sense has been communicated to a high official  of a neutral country, probably as aballon cVessai.    Two leaders of Bulgarian  Government Socialists, by name Sukezoff and Jubalief,have lately been  in Switzerland, en route for Berlin and Stockholm, conducting a pro-German  propaganda in  favour  of  Germany amongst   Swiss  Socialists, andadvocating the policy  of a peace  without annexations or indemnities.   Possibly asthe outcome  of their activities and.  discussions, an  &quot;authorised declaration on behalfof the Bulgarian Committee  of  National Defence &quot; has been  indirectly conveyed toHis Majesty&apos;s Minister at Berne.  After asserting Bulgaria&apos;s predominant role in the balkans, and her intention to  institute a  vigorous  offensive to drive  the Allies fromSalonika at a propitious moment, the declaration proceeds  &quot; to make a final  effort atreconciliation with the  Allies &quot; on  behalf  of Bulgarian  patriots, and  formulate anumber of proposals, the gist of which is that  in return  for the Allies recognisingBulgarian aspirations in Macedonia and  the Dobrudja, and in Thrace (as laid downby the Treaties of San Stefano and  London respectively) the  Committee  of NationalDefence are prepared to dethrone the King, overthrow  the Government, and  detachBulgaria  from  the Central  Powers for the purposes  of a separate  pjace.  TheCommittee propose that a secret meeting  of Powers interested in Bulgarian questionsbe held in. Paris to meet their delegates  and discuss these matters.   The Committee-consists apparently of four gentlemen of no particular authority.                                   GENERAL.   The Army Council have appointed Major-General Sir John Hanbury Williams  tosuperintend arrangements for the accommodation in Holland  of British prisoners  ofwar  to  be  transferred  from  Germany.  The  exchange  of  prisoners  under theagreement  recently  concluded is  still  delayed  by  the  action  of  the  GermanGovernment in refusing  to  allow Hull  to  be used  as  the port of  shipment forexchanged prisoners.   The Admiralty have now suggested Boston,  being opposed  toLowestoft  for  military  reasons, and  considering Southwold  quite  unsuitable for reasons that were fully explained at the Hague.   The  Netherlands Minister  at  Constantinople  has reported  that  the  TurkishGovernment are unwilling to agree to a general  exchange  of all British and French
civilian prisoners in Turkey against all Turkish civilian prisoners in England andFrance.  They add that unless Great Britain accedes to their demand for the releaseof Sabri, the Porte will not consider the question of an exchange of civilian prisoners,and will intern all British subjects in Turkey (they are now at liberty) in concentrationcamps.   With  a view  to bringing increased  pressure  to  bear upon  the  TurkishGovernment in this matter, Sir R.  Rodd has  been instructed  to  request the ItalianGovernment to agree to  the British Governments endeavouring to induce Idris elSenussi to hand over his Turkish prisoners to British custody.1   The Bulgarian Government have released 30 British  and nine French  prisonersof war,  who are due to reach Lyons on the 28th  of August.  They have  done this inconfident expectation  that certain  Bulgarian prisoners  in  Egypt will  be  speedilyrepatriated.
