SECRET.APPRECIATION OF  THE  ATTACHED  WESTERN  AND  GENERAL                           REPORT, No.  31.                                   AUSTRALIA.   The Australian  Government evidently feel that Australia&apos;^ national sentiment isnot sufficiently met by the existence of separate Australian Divisions, only three ofwhich are united in an Australian Corps, and wotdd like to see all their five divisionsgrouped together in a single  corps or small army of  two corps.  On the  other hand,they have hitherto maintained an exceptional position with regard to the death penalty for desertion, which, in Sir D. Haig&apos;s opinion, has had unfortunate  consequences ontheir discipline.   The  difficulty might, perhaps, be met by  mutual  concession on thebasis of a single Australian force, with its discipline assimilated to that  of the rest ofHis Majesty&apos;s Forces, thus bringing Australia exactly into lino with  Canada  in  thesematters.                                     FRANCE.   The unpleasant revelations of the Dttval-Ahnereyda  affair have  seriously shakenthe position of M. Malvy, the one Minister who has managed to stay in office throughoutall changes of government during the war.  If M. Malvy goes it will be a  triumph forM. Cleinenceau,  who has laid  himself out to drive him from office for his complaisancein dealing with pacifist intrigues.                                 GERMAN A [-TALKS.   Herr Michaelis&apos;s new &quot; free Committee &quot;  is thoroughly  typical  of  the lines uponwhich  German  constitutional development is proceeding.   The Reichstag, throughleading  members of  all  parlies, is  being effectively brought into touch with, theintimate discussion of  German Imperial policy,   lire Government  hopes thereby tohave  the advantage of knowing  exactly what the Reichstag thinks, and to give theparty leaders the  advantage of  knowing  exactly what it  thinks.  The object isharmonious co-operation between  Government and Reichstag, but always on the clear understanding that it is the Government and not the Reichstag which governs.                                     SWEDEN.    The Swedish situation will need careful watching.  Admiral Lindmans declaration that Sweden will refuse to accept any demand for the cessation of  her trade with theCentral Powers, indicates  that the Conservatives mean to make all the use  they canfor the  purposes of the coming election of Swedish resentment at anything resemblingdictation.  The trouble in Finland may also be of great assistance to them, as  it will tend to throw discredit on the liberals and Socialists, wdio  have  backed  the russian revolution, even if it does  not  actually raise  a clamour for  intervention against russia.                                      China.    The attitude of the Russian and Italian Ministers at Peking in attempting to evadethe pledges given to China last May,  if she entered the war, is unfortunate.
                                     URUGUAY.   The attitude of the United  States in declining  to assist in securing facilities for french and British warships in  Uruguayan ports, and their similar attitude over thequestion of Panama Canal facilities, show that the  State Department at Washingtonis not yet sufficiently  whole-hearted about the war to place the success of the Allies asa whole  before its own  aspirations to an American  hegemony in Central  and SouthAmerica.                             Tin: SHJITINC; SITUATION.   Unless the appeal to the Presidents fairmindedness and generosity prevails theconfiscation of all. the British  ships  now  building in  America is  imminent.   Theeffects of  this,  both  during and  after  the  war, may   be very serious.  The  only practical conclusion is that we  should order nothing in  the United States that wecan by any chance secure within the  British Empire, even at a  higher  cost and  with greater difficulty.  This  is  imperative,  no less  in the interest of Anglo-Americanfriendship than in that of our own independence.                                PEACE DISCUSSIONS.   President  Wilsoifs reply to  the Papal  Note  exactly  meets  the  situation.  Itrestates the case against Germanydn vigorous language  suited to the American taste.It gives a useful handle for  agitation  to  the  elements of discontent with the existing system of government in Germany itself.   Above all, it puts a definite stopper on alldetailed  discussion of peace  terms till Germany is  really  beaten for  only completedefeat can bring  about that change of  system  in Germany to which  the Presidentlooks for his effective guarantees of a lasting  peace.

PART  I.-BRITISH  EMPIRE  AND  AFRICA.                                   CANADA.   In deference to the  views  of  the Canadian Minister of Finance, the Chancellor of&apos;the Exchequer has  now  agreed that after  September  the Canadian  Governmentsmonthly advance  of 825,000,000  will  be  reserved  in its  entirety for munitionspayments.   He points out, however, that this arrangement will leave no funds withwhich to -pay for cheese and other essential foodstuffs.  It will therefore be necessaryto devote to these  food  requirements the 315,000,000 from New York funds, whichthe Chancellor of the Exchequer had previously hoped to be able to use to supplement the sums supplied by the Canadian Government for munitions.  It is suggested thatthe Canadian Government may be able to provide further funds  for the  purchase of essential foodstuffs, after exhaustion of the  850,000,000 note issue.   The Royal Assent was given to the Conscription Act on  28th August  1917.  TheDominion Government have made preparations for establishing one thousand localtribunals, and regulations to govern their  methods of work are ready to be printed.A Military Service Council of five Members will be created  to assist the Minister ofJustice  in the administration of the Act.  Mr. Justice Duff, of the  Canadian SupremeCourt, will be the  Central Appeal Judge  under the Act.   At a mass meeting of  the  Liberals, of South Winnipeg the attitude of the  recentLiberal Convention was  repudiated,  and a  Resolution was passed  opposing  the leadership of Sir Wilfrid Laurier unless he consented to the principle of  compulsory military Service.   The meeting declared itself as unreservedly in favour of compulsionfor military service,  and compulsory contribution of wealth ; and it expressed itself infavour of a National Government.  The Premier of Manitoba (Air. T. C.  Norris) statedat the  meeting  that every - Member of the Manitoba Government was  in favour of conscription.   At the Annual Meeting of the General Liberal Association of Toronto, a resolution of confidence in Sir  Wilfrid LauriePs leadership was unanimously adopted.   In a letter to  the Secretary of  &quot; The Win-the-War League,&quot;  Sir Wilfrid Laurierhas announced his adherence to  the  policy of a National Non-partisan Government.He further stated  that it would be the duty of the Leader in the  next  Parliament toascertain from Great Britain and the Allies the extent to which the participation ofCanada could be used to the  best  advantage.  In this letter he  declares himself infavour of a vigorous system  of  voluntary enlistment, the more adequate taxation of wealth, and the safeguarding of the people from the war profiteers.   As to conscription,he adheres to the  Referendum and a General Election.   The majority of  the clauses in  the Soldiers&apos; Voting Bill have now been dealt withby the  House of  Commons  in Committee.   As amended, the Bill enfranchises all the oversea soldiers who enlisted  in  Canada, and those who  are  not  regularly domiciledin the  Dominion  can vote as  if they were living in the constituency in which theyenlisted.  Under the Bill, as  amended,  Canadians serving  with the British or allied armies  will  be entitled  to vote.   The right to vote is also conferred on Hindus fromBritish  Columbia and on Canadian-Indians serving oversea.                      AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH.   Referring to the reply of the Secretary of State for the Colonies  on -the subject ofthe organisation of the Australian fighting formations (vide last report, the Common-.wealth Government have expressed disappointment  that  the Army Council is not in sympathy with their desire  that  the  five Australian Divisions  should  be  groupedtogether in one  or  more Australian  Corps with  Australian Staff  Officers.  Theyconsider this would be more acceptable to Australian sentiment than a statement thatAustralian and British Staff  Officers  are  regarded  as interchangeable,  a  principle which,  they  suggest, has   not  hitherto  been actually carried out  in  practice.Finally, they hold  that  the  services  of a  senior Australian officer in  close  touchwith the AVar  Office would  facilitate decisions  in  many matters that do  not comedirectly within the  purview  of Sir William Bird wood,  who is responsible  for thefighting efficiency of the Australian Imperial Force.
   The Secretary of State for the Colonies has informed  the Government  of  theCommonwealth  (23rd  August) that  the  Commander-in-Chief in France  has  againdrawn  urgent attention  to the  serious  consequenpes  (for which  he  cannot  be&apos;responsible) which may ensue  unless  the Government  of  the Commonwealth  canrender  their troops subject to the Army Act without such  restrictions  as exist atpresent.  With the exception of  the Australian Divisions, all His Majesty&apos;s Forces inFrance (including the New  Zealand Division) are subject  to the Army Act withoutreservation ;  the average number of cases of  desertion in the Australian Divisions isfour times higher than in the rest of the Army, and Sir Douglas Haig ascribes this fact entirely to the present state  of  the law.   Moreover, the  fact that  the AustralianForce is exempt from the discipline of the Army Act, where it gives power  to  inflictthe  death penalty for  desertion, places  that Force in an invidious and privileged position, and creates bad  feeling among the troops.   In forwarding  the Commander-in-Chiefs representations  on this  subject, the Army Council lay stress  on the very grave nature of the situation thus created, and His Majesty&apos;s Government  thereforeearnestly trust that the Government of the Commonwealth will give urgent attention tothe question of remedying this serious position.  It is  pointed out that the  power ofinflicting the death penalty is very sparingly used, and that  such sentences are onlyconfirmed when the offence is very deliberate and an example urgently required.    Mr. Groom has stated in the House of  Representatives, in  reply to a  question,that there is no truth in the  statement that an additional Australian Division is being formed.    A Bill authorising  the Commonwealth to raise 8,000,000Z.  for  advances to  theStates (excepting New South Wales) has passed the  Federal Parliament.    Mr. Hughes has stated in the House  of Representatives that it  is impracticable to enforce the policy of restricting the sale of enemy goods purchased before the war.Trading  in goods, however, bearing enemy trade marks  or  belonging to prescribedfirms is still prohibited.    The  Colonial  Office  has  communicated  to   the  Commonwealth Government(24th August) a full statement of the tonnage situation, with particular reference to ocean-going  steamers (a  resume  of  which  wdll  be found under  &quot; The  shipping situation,&quot; infra) and has emphasised  the  necessity for general co-operation in thepolicy laid down by the  Shipping Controller.  That polic3r calls for the  observance of two guiding principles :  (1) that the first object to be sought in the  employment of&quot;tonnage is the maintenance of supplies essential  to the prosecution of the war,  and(2) that, for the  most economical use of tonnage, these supplies must be  taken fromthe  sources nearest at hand.   Thus, so  long as flour  and wheat (for example) areobtainable from the United  States or other nearer countries, it is not possible  to allottonnage to convey it  from Australia, except incidentally in liners.  Similarly, meat is brought from the Argentine, this being the  nearest source of supply.  Bearing  this principle in mind, the Shipping Controller observes that the Commonwealth Govern-ment would greatly assist the polic3r of His Majesty&apos;s Government if they would agreeto  allow vessels which they own  or  control  to  trade with the United kingdom from nearer points.  If, however, the3&apos; desire  that these vessels should in  all circum-stances visit  an  Australian terminal port, the Shipping  Controller  gives  facts  and figures to show- that (except in the case of sailing vessels or neutral steamers, whichwall not  enter the danger zone) the polic3r  of  using  tonnage to carry Australianwdieat  to American or  Canadian Pacific  ports   is  not  as  economical  as  directtrade with the  United  Kingdom via   the Panama Canal,  which  route  is alreadyfollowed by Australian meat boats.  Speaking generally, the Shipping Controller doesnot hold out  any hope that Australian trade conditions can be improved until meansare found to replace the tonnage lost.  Subject to the paramount  purposes connectedwith the prosecution  of  the war, His Majesty&apos;s  Government  will  do everything possible  to  relieve the  trade situation;  at  the. same  time  they emphasise  theimportance of the shipping problem, and trust that the Commonwealth Governmentmay be able  and willing to place a certain amount  of Australian coastal  tonnage at-the disposal of the Shipping Controller.    On  23rd August the Governor General  forwarded for  the  information  of  His&quot;-Majesty&apos;s Government a full and detailed account of the causes, extent, and  effects ofthe serious strikes which,  commencing in New  South Wales on 2nd August, havespread  throughout the various States of the Commonwealth.   On the  15th  the federal government intervened, and issued a proclamation declaring their resolute determina-tion to  check what is evidently an organised attempt to  hold up traffic by land and  sea,and to prevent the transport of supplies  vital to the welfare  of  the Empire and  theAllies.   Under severe penalties all persons were warned against  inciting to disorder
or interfering with transport work, and arrangements were made for carrying on with free labour reinforced  by volunteers.   The  Prime  Minister is  of opinion that  theupheaval is one of the most serious with  which  Australia  has,.ever been confronted,and that a  section  of the strikers is  seeking to put  a stop to all  work throughout  theCommonwealth.   He believes that this section is led by those who at the last  electiontried to gain control of the Government.   The fight is likely  to be a bitter one,  but itis a hopeful sign that in New South  Wales, where  the trouble began, the authoritieshave  been able to keep the public services running.   There has been no serious trouble in  South Australia.    The Minister for Home Affairs and Territories (Mr. Glynn) has presented a Reportto  Parliament on  the  Northern  Territory.   This  shows  some  progress   towardssettlement, and  states  that  the  Commonwealth  has spent  8,9-15,000Z. upon  theTerritory.  The Minister considers that development is likely to be on pastoral andmineral  lines as   the  heat  would  interfere  with  agricultural   operations.   the administrator has, however,  reported that  if white  labour  had to be employed at current rates of wages, no farmer would be able to  make ends meet.    The Governor of South  Australia reported  on  the  27th August that  he had approved a- Coalition Ministry under the Premiership of Mr. Peake.  The  Press gives the composition of the Ministry as follows :       Mr. Peake :  Premier, Chief Secretary, and Attorney-General.      Mr. Butler :  Treasurer and Minister of Railways.    -  Mr. Bice :  Public Works and Alines.      Mr. Blundell:  Repatriation, Agriculture and Industry.      Mr. Jackson : Crown Lands and Immigration.      Mr. Styles :  Education.                                NEW ZEALAND.  -    The Prime Minister of New Zealand referred in the House of Representatives on 3rd July 1917 to the future of the German Pacific Colonies.   He said Members knewperfectly well that outside of Australia and New Zealand   there  was  considerabledifference  of opinion in regard to the German Colonies.   There was no  difference ofopinion in this matter  in  New Zealand  or Atistralia.  If these  Colonies were  to go back  to Germany  at the end of the  war, it would mean that they would  be occupiedhy our present enemies, who  might use them as  naval  bases and headquarters forsubmarines and  aeroplanes.  We should  emphasise  on  every suitable occasion  ouropposition to the  return of these Colonies to an  unscrupulous  rival who  might use them to attack us  more successfully  on some future occasion  than at the present time.Sir Joseph Ward also dealt with  the subject, and  said it would be a crime  if these colonies were ever  allowed to  revert to  Germany or to  any other foreign  country.If they went back to Germany they would  always be a menace, like a watch-dog readyto put its fangs into us.    The Prime Minister has inquired whether  the Committee  which is being set up bythe Secretary of State for the  Colonies to consider the question of Imperial Preferencewill deal in this connection with the question of overseas shipping.                                SOUTH  AFRICA.    The Government of South Africa have  drawn attention to the undesirable results which  follow from the omission of  all reference, in official  communiques, to engage-ments in which British arms  have been unsuccessful.  They point out that information in regard  to  such incidents (they cite, for example, two  recent engagements in EastAfrica in  which  certain units suffered heavily) is bound  to reach South Africa sooner or later, and they therefore consider  that it is  advisable that the facts should be stated,both  to avoid the  appearance  of a policy of concealment  and to prevent the spread ofexaggerated  and  alarming accounts. Public opinion in the Union  is  inclined toresent the omission of reference to such incidents.    With   reference to  the  South  African  wool   clip for   1917-18,  His Majesty&apos;sGovernment have replied expressing regret that they Cannot  acquiesce in  the  proposal (vide  Report No. 29) that they  should pay  a  higher price   than  for Australian andNew Zealand wools.  Any large sales made to Japan or to the United States  woulddefeat the  objects which His Majesty&apos;s Government  had in view in offering to purchase the entire  clip.  It is therefore hoped that  the South African  Government  may be  ableto confine  sales to Japan  and the  United States to the balance of 1916-17 wool andsell the entire new season&apos;s clip to His Majest3r&apos;s Government.     3657--5                            B
G                        PORTUGUESE  EAST AFRICA.    The Administrator of Southern  Rhodesia reports (22nd  August) that  a  nativemessenger arrived recently at Salisbury from. Makosa, one of the leading chiefs of theParue district.   He came bearing a request from Makosa for assistance against thePortuguese,   who,  he  declared,  are  grievously  ill-treating   his  people.    the administrator replied  that if the natives came from Portuguese territory into  SouthernRhodesia they would be  safe front pursuit or  molestation.  The  messenger answeredthat  if the British would not take over  the Portuguese territory and allow  them to live there in peace, they would  cross over into British territory.  It  would appearthat  a number  of  the native  Chiefs  and their followers, rebels  against Portugueseauthority, intend to seek refuge  in Rhodesia.   The High Commissioner for SouthAfrica  considers that,  although  likely  to  be  resented  by  the  Portuguese,  the administrator^ attitude is justifiable on grounds of humanity and policy.    His Majesty&apos;s Minister  at  Lisbon has  been instructed to make it clear  to  thePortuguese Government that the  action of their local authorities in East Africa, in refusing permission to General Northey&apos;s recruited carriers to accompany  his forcein pursuit of the retreating Germans, is calculated to jeopardise an important military operation at  a  critical  stage.   His Majesty&apos;s  Government cannot believe  that  thePortuguese  Government  desire to prevent General Northey from  consummating a success which has been so useful to Portugal in  clearing Portuguese Nyasaland of theenemy.    With  reference to the action  of the Portuguese Government in prohibiting theexport of  maize from Portuguese East Africa except to Portugal, His Majesty&apos;s Ministerat Lisbon, under instructions, has  drawn their attention to the fact that the maize forwhich export  licences  have recently been withheld at Beira, is  Rhodesian  grain in transit, and  that His  Majesty&apos;s  Government cannot consent to the  imposition of restrictions  on  the  transport  of  British  produce to the  United Kingdom.  ThePortuguese Government  have therefore  been requested to issue  instructions that the rhodesian maize in question may  be shipped without delay.                                    NIGERIA.    The Governor-General reported (20th August) in the matter of the Cameroons&apos;boundary, that the French were  pressing  for  the Misselele plantation, which  liesentirely within  the  French  sphere  but  was included in the British as the  result ofSir C. DobelFs proclamation of 17th  March 1916.  He proposed to hand it over atonce.   In reply, the Colonial Office stated that it is desirable that the  Mttngo Rivershould be the permanent  Anglo-French boundary, and that it is therefore undesirable to hand over  to  the French any  territory  west of that river, if any other  amicable settlement is possible.   Furthermore,  Mr. Long suggests  that the  terms  of  sir c. DobelFs proclamation may be regarded as  a  minor modification  of  the Picot line,justified  by  the  French Note  of  3rd March 1916.  If not, do the  French recognisethat the Elong country is in the British sphere, as laid down by the Picot line ?   Theycan hardly expect to  have it both ways.  The  Colonial Office is at a  loss to under-stand why the present  question  has  been raised, and suggests that  the Governor-General should arrange to have it  referred for discussion and settlement between  theHome Governments.                                    MALTA.    With  reference to the conditions under which Maltese-born British subjects inAlgeria are willing to serve  in  the French Army, Lord Bertie has been instructed toobtain assurances from the French Government  on both the points specified  (vide lastReport).                                 HONG  KONG.    On 21st August the Governor of the Colony reported that he has introduced a bill before the Legislative Council which provides for  compulsory service, on territorial force  lines, for all persons between the ages of 18 and 55, it being understood that theage limit and  length of period for training will be reconsidered six months after peace is declared.   The unofficial members of the Council unanimously urge that compulsionshould only be applied for the  period of  the war ;  the official members  support  theGovernor  and the Bill  as drafted.
PART  II.-FOREIGN AFFAIRS.                                    FRANCE.    With a view to strengthening the position  of French exchange by a reduction ofthe British trade balance against France, and by fostering French industries wherever possible, special and temporary arrangements  have been made by His  Majesty&apos;sGovernment for the imposition of drastic restrictions on British exports to France andfor the removal of restrictions on  French  exports to Great  Britain.   In view of thespecial conditions attaching to the Portuguese wine trade and to the trade in silk from italy and Japan,  His Majesty&apos;s Government have intimated their willingness to admitPortuguese  wine and Italian and Japanese  silk  into Great Britain without restriction ;but the Governments concerned have been  informed that the specially favourable treatment accorded to France cannot be extended to them as regards other goods.    The Press has devoted increasing attention to the Duval-Almereycla affair since theissue of a communique on the subject issued after a Cabinet Council on 24th August.Therein it was stated that, after the enquiry before an investigating&apos; Magistrate, thecharge against Duval had  been shown to  be one of treasonable intercourse with the-enemy and the case had therefore been  transferred from civil to military jurisdiction.At the end of May, Duval was  searched at the  frontier of Switzerland and a chequefound upon him  was seized and sent to  the  second  Bureau  of the General  Staff.M. Ribot, having heard towards the end  of June that this cheque had been restored to Duval without the knowledge of either  the Minister  of War  or the Minister of theInterior, called  for  an  immediate  investigation of  the  matter by  the  Minister ofJustice.    The actual  restitution of the  cheque  was  made  at  the instigation ofM. Leymarie, Chef de  Cabinet in the Ministry of  the Interior, who, it seems, wassubseq uently  (on  7th July) appointed to be Director of Surete Generale.  following upon the enquiry by the Minister of Justice (says the  official communique) M. Leymarieresigned the latter office. According to M. Clemenceau&apos;s paper (&apos;&apos; L&apos;Homme enchaine&quot;),M. Leymarie  still retains his position as M. Malvy&apos;s Chef de Cabinet ; the same paperasserts that M. Ribot knew about M. Le3&apos;inarie&apos;s having returned the  cheque to Duvaland nevertheless approved of his  appointment as Director of Surete.  The &quot; Matin &quot;of the  20th called on the  Government to  make an  exhaustive and fearless enquiry into all the  facts of  the case.   M. Daudet, in &quot; l&apos;Action  Francaise,&quot; states that he informed the  Minister of the Colonies two months ago  of the  treason of Almereydaand Duval.   Al.  Clemenceau declares that M.  Leymarie  shares with M. Malvy theresponsibility for the death of  Almereyda.  On the 24-th, Lord. Bertie expressed theopinion  that  the affair may necessitate a reconstruction of  the  Cabinet  and the renewal from office of M.  Malvy.  On the  27th, the Press published a telegram froma  member  of the &quot;Bonnet Rouge&quot;  Staff  to M. Caillaux, showing  that he  was on terms of friendship with Almereyda.                                    ITALY.   There was rioting in Turin, coincident with the  declaration of a general strike, on22nd  August.   The military  authorities  took charge on the 23rd, and order  wasspeedily  restored.  A private  report received by  Sir  R.  Rodd  put the number ofpersons killed at 60.  The outbreak was without political significance, and solely dueto the failure of the bread supply brought about by the sinking  of a grain ship inother words, to defects in the local system of food distribution.                                   BELGIUM.   The French Government have agreed in principle with  His Majesty&apos;s Governmentto make a sixth joint loan to Belgium (provisionally fixed at 500,000.000 francs pending
information as to the amount of the United States loan) and to authorise immediatepayments being made therefrom.  The French Minister of Finance, however, considersit indispensable that  an  agreement  should be reached at  once as  to the amount ofmonthly expenditure to  be met out of  loan  funds,  and from which the  amount ofAmerica&apos;s contribution should be deducted.                                    GREECE.   For the  purpose set forth in last week&apos;s Report, His Majesty&apos;s Government have authorised. Mr. Crackanthorpe to take the first opportunity which  may present itself of having audience formally with His Majesty King Alexander.   There is  evidence  of increasing rivalry and friction between the Italians and  theFrench.   At a  recent  interview  with Lord  Robert Cecil,  the Italian Ambassadorspoke with great bitterness of the general attitude of France towards Italy and laidespecial stress on the action of the French at Koritza, which he described as  a  purelyAlbanian town.   lie declared that the evacuation  of Epirus by the Italian troops was proceeding  gradually, but that the French were not withdrawing  their forces.   On23rd August Sir R. ltodd reported that the Greek Minister at Rome had suggested thatGeneral Sarrail and the Italian General Commanding in Albania should be instructedto devise a plan for the simultaneous evacuation of Greece.   The Paris Conferencenot having laid down any definite date or method of  procedure, it is necessary thatsome such plan of evacuation should  be  agreed upon, in consultation with the GreekGovernment, so that the local Greek authorities may receive the requisite instructions for  taking  over  charge.   Sir  R.  Rodd  considers it advisable  that  the plan  of evacuation should  be concerted  on British  initiative, as the  French and  ItalianMilitary Commanders are so distrustful that they may not believe each other&apos;s reports.On 24th August he  reported  that the Minister for Foreign Affairs had telegraphedinstructions  to  the  General  Commanding  at  Valona  to  arrange  the  necessarypreliminaries for simultaneous evacuation with General Sarrail ; the Italians, he said,could hardly retire from Janina so long as the French remain at Prevesa.  On  thefollowing day His  Majesty&apos;.s  Government,  acting  upon Sir  R.  Rcuhbs   proposal,instructed him  and Lord Bertie  to  suggest  to  the Italian and French Governmentsrespectively, that the representatives of the protecting Powers at Athens should draw up a plan of evacuation in consultation Avith the Greek Government.  On the 26th,Mr. Crackanthorpe expressed doubts as to the advisability of this course, because of theuncompromising attitude of the Italian Minister, his open hostility to the French, andthe fact  that he is distrusted by the Greek Government.   lie would probably makeItalian evacuation conditional on an extension  of Italian influence  over port control.On the 28th, Sir R. Rodd was instructed to discuss the matter with Baron Sonnino.   The finally revised text of an agreement as to the constitution of the Commission&apos;for the Assessment of Indemnity Claims has been  submitted to those concerned  bythe Greek Government.  In  a covering  letter addressed to His Majesty&apos;s Charged&apos;Affaires the  Minister for Foreign Affairs expresses the opinion that, whereas  theCommission was originally international  in  character,  it has  now become,  by virtueof changes in the political situation, an organ of the Greek Government.   Its  duty isno longer to  compel the Government to pay indemnities to Venizelists, but  to assistthe Greek Government to apportion their amount.  M. Venizelos is extremely anxiousto avoid all appearance of foreign control or pressure in  this matter.   The  membersof the Commission concur generally in the expediency of the proposed change in  itscharacter.   The French Government  have suggested  the  early convocation in Paris of theCommittee (agreed upon under Clause 7 of  the  recommendations of the Paris Con-ference) for the discussion of Greek finance.   At the same time they have  proposedthat a  special financial delegate should be sent  to Athens forthwith to enquire  locallyinto the financial situation.  His Majesty&apos;s Government are of  opinion that  the latterproposal is unnecessary, pending receipt of the report of the proposed Committee.   Mr. Crackanthorpe reported on 24th August that now that the other Allied controlshave  been  abolished,  the Italians  and French   have naturally  become  somewhatjealous of the retention of the whole system  of  port  control by the British.  Thequestion of port control outside the limits of  the British  naval zone is particularlydelicate,  as  it  has  always  borne  an  inter-Allied character.  Mr. Crackanthorpe
considers it advisable to  come  to *a friendly understanding on the  subject beforecommunicating with the Greek Government.  The Italians  desire a larger share inport,  control, especially at Patras and Prevesa ;  the French  have made proposals inregard  to control at Greek ports  within the French  naval zone, including Pineus.Mr.  Crackanthorpe  considers it  advisable  not  to  obstruct  the French claim to co-operation within&apos; their own zone, provided  that  satisfactory arrangements are madefor the British zone and for safeguarding our naval  responsibilities  in  the JEgeanSea.  The Greek Government, however, are also evidently disturbed by  the apparentlypermanent character of the British Port Control.   The Greek  Minister has lodged  a complaint On the subject at the Foreign Office (transmitted to Mr. Crackanthorpe on27th  August),  stating that the  increased rigour of control  in the islands over pass-ports, posts  and  telegraphs is producing  an unfortunate impression.  Mr. Crackan-thorpe, in  reply, states  that  he has  received no  complaints, and is  addressing an enquiry to the  Minister for Foreign Affairs on the subject.    On  the 24th of August  the King of Greece proceeded to Salonika to consider reliefmeasures for the distressed population.  Mr. Crackanthorpe suggests  that the HighCommissioner  in Egypt should  be requested to furnish all or part  of the suppliesurgently needed by the Greek Government, His Majesty&apos;s Government guaranteeingto replace the  same as soon as possible.  A confidential  report from Salonika  statesthat a large portion of the Jewish population objects to the idea of being  sent to OldGreece, and are  thinking  of  emigrating to Tunis, being of  opinion  that  Salonika  is unlikely to recover commercially.  The French authorities appear to  be facilitatingthis  emigration. &quot; Mr. Crackanthorpe enqxures whether His  Majesty&apos;s  government desire to encourage it in the direction of British possessions,  such  as Egypt.    The French  General Staff scheme for  the  organisation of a military mission in greece has been confidentially communicated to His Majesty&apos;s Charge d&apos;Affaires at athens. It  contemplates  the organisation  of nine  or ten Greek divisions  by the1st of January 1918, of  which the three Venizelist divisions already mobilised wouldbe completed  before 1st October.  There will be training centres at Athens, Larissa,and. Janina.  The French Mission under General Braquet is to consist of 83 officersand 37 non-commissioned officers exclusive of the  members of the Salonika  Alission,which is to  be  merged in it:    General BraquePs position (as  confidentially communicated to Mr.  Crackanthorpeby the  Minister of War) will  be that  of an  intermediary between the  Greek Chief  ofthe  General Staff  and  the Minister of War,  directing  matters under  the  lattersauthority and invested with such powers as the Minister may consider  advisable.  Hewill  represent the Commander-in-Chief of the Allied Armies at Salonika, and  at thesame time the  Chief of the French General Staff at, Paris.  Mr. Crackanthorpe uncler-stands  that  the  trench  are by no means  satisfied with this arrangement and withthe limitation  of General Braquets powers.    Having  learned that  General  Sarrail has  declared  his inability for the present  totake  over any part of  the Salonika front  held  by General  Milne,  and being also&apos;informed that  the several contingents along that front are very unequally distributed,wdth the result that the British forces are holding a length of line quite disproportionateto their strength, His Majesty&apos;s Government have  requested the French  Governmentto instruct General  Sarrail to make a  more  equable  division of the line among theAllied  contingents.  At the  same time Lord Bertie has been instructed  to point outthat  the Serbian Divisions cannot possibly be expected  to hold the length of front nowallotted to them  (see also under Serbia).    The Intelligence Bureair&apos;s report for the week ending 22nd August draws attentionto an important  omission in the English Press reports of the speech from the Throneat the opening of the Greek Chamber.  These reports  conclude the second paragraphof  the  speech  with the words &quot; We have repealed the  Decree which, by a violation of&quot; the Constitution, dissolved  the Chamber, and have  convoked this Chamber for its&quot; regular second session.&quot;  They omit the important addition, &quot; in order that it shouldbe succeeded,  before long by the  convocation  of  the  Revisionist Assembly.&quot;   Com- menting  on this promise, the influential  Venizelist organ &quot;i\&apos;ea Hellas&quot;  observes that the duty of the Assembly will not be to discuss the continuance of the Monarchy,but &quot; to revise the  Constitution, founded on the people&apos;s sovereignty ; to consolidate it,^ and with it the Throne.&quot;   The new Assembly, it  declares, is  to  be a  revisionist andnot a constituent body, that  is to say, it wdll merely revise  the  Constitution with the      3657-5                             C
object  of  limiting the powers  of  the  King  in- matters wherein heretofore his  pre-rogatives have  been left undefined.  This  is strictly in accordance wdth the whol ecourse  of the policy of M. Venizelos.   The question of the provisioning of Greece threatens to be one  of permanent and increasing difficulty.  M.  Venizelos estimates that the local supplies of wheat will be exhausted by 5th October, and he therefore makes an  urgent request  for 5,000 tons to reach Greece before that date.  The needs of the situation have been increased bythe destruction of stocks at Salonika and by  the rate  of  consumption in the Army.Mr. Crackanthorpe states  that the  present bread ration  (under half-a-pound per head)cannot be  reduced  and that  the  partial failure of  the maize  crop  must entailcorrespondingly increased imports of food supplies.                                    SERBIA.   During the Prince Regents recent visit to the Serbian Army on the Salonika frontHis  Royal Highness was greatly impressed by  their jaded and depressed condition,resulting  from  their  need of  rest.   It  has   been suggested  to  General  Sarrailthat the necessary relief might  be obtained by a reduction  of the  length  of  frontheld by the  Serbian   Army,  but  he   seems unwilling  to  accept  the  suggestion.This information has been confidentially communicated to His Majesty&apos;s representative at Corfu, but will probably be transmitted to His Majesty&apos;s Government, with a request for assistance, by the Serbian Minister in London.                          ALLIED  ENEMY AFFAIRS.   In  au interview granted  to a  representative of the Budapest &quot;Az Est,&quot; the bulgarian  Premier,  M. Radoslavoff,  is quoted as  having said :  &quot; The  unity of the&quot; Quadruple Alliance is perfect.   Central  Europe will  shortly form one  gigantic&quot; Empire, whose different countries will  retain their freedom.  They will, as it were,&quot; melt into each other.&quot;  The &quot; Vorwarts &quot; wonders whether the German Governmentare at one with Radoslavoff in this opinion.                              GERMAN  AFFAIRS.   The stress and turmoil of public opinion in Germany have been  clearly reflected in the proceedings of the Reichstag aud  the utterances of the Chancellor and theForeign Secretary during the past wreek.  In his speech before the main Committee ofthe Reichstag  on 21st August Herr Michaelis reviewed the political and militarysituation to his own satisfaction ; incidentally, he warned the latest recruits  to the ranks  of  Germany&apos;s  enemies  (China, Siam, and  Liberia) that  they  would  bebrought to account under International Law  (notwithstanding  the  KaiseFs  dictumas to  its abolition) for  damage done to German interests.  At the secret  sessionof the 23rd, the  Chancellor was challenged  to state definitely his position towardsthe Reichstag  Majority&apos;s Peace Resolution, and to explain the  precise  significance of the qualifying words &quot; as I understand them,&quot;  used by  him  in  accepting the  terms  of  that Resolution.    His  rhetorical   explanation  served  merely  toconfuse the  issue  still  further.   The &quot;Vorwarts,&quot;  referring to this incident,admits that  the &quot;break&quot;  between  Herr Michaelis  and  the  Reichstag  majorityhas  been  temporarily  mended  by  his conciliatory  attitude,  but  declares  thatthe German people&apos;s  distrust of the  new Chancellor has  been  thereby  increased.The  Press  generally  recognises the fact that nothing can be gleaned from thepublic utterances  of  Germany&apos;s leader, nor  does anyone  know  whether his viewson the subject of the Peace Resolution  are those  of Hindenburg  of  those of Scheide-manji, or a mixture of both.  Herr Wolff in the, &quot; Berliner Tageblatt &quot;  declares thatthe Chancellor lacks the authority  and prestige necessary for his position, that hestands confessed as a type of the absolute bureaucracy, which must  be abolished.&quot; Der Tag &quot; (23rd August) sees in the incident a prospect of renewed friction between government and  Parliament.
   On  Saturday,  the 25th, the  Chancellor discussed home  affairs  in  the  main committee  of  the Reichstag, - and  outlined  his  new  scheme  &quot;for bringing aboutcloser co-operation between the Government and the parties&quot; his &quot;free Committee&quot; to deal with single,  defined questions, and, in the first place, with the reply to thePapal Peace Note.  The Committee will  consist of seven members representing thefive  large parties in the Reichstag and of seven delegates  from -the  Bundesrath, thewhole under the Presidency of the Chancellor.  As a  body it wall be completely free,unfettered by any order of business, not directly representative either of the Bundesrath,the Government, or of any political  parties, but a body of political experts, enjoyingpublic confidence.  The Chancellor  professed to regard it as  means  to the end ofattaining &quot; the necessary modifications and improvements in our inner political life,&quot;which cculd not  be  completely  changed  during  war time.   He  added that  the prussian Electoral Reform Bill, now being prepared, would become law in due course,as promised by his Majesty, but even more immediate are the questions of peace conditions  and financial reform.                                          ,   Baron von Ktthlmann  enjoys a- far better  press  than  the Chancellor ; indeed anumber of  papers, applauding his maiden speech as Foreign Secretary, express regret that he was not selected to  fill  Bethmann-Holl.weg&apos;s place.   Asa matter of fact, the speech which has won him such golden opinions  resembles the chancellors in  thematter of elusive  hedging.   His mental reservations  are the same, but somewhat lessclumsity obvious.   After declaring to the satisfaction of the Reichstag Majority that&quot; a policy that is founded on might alone is fore-doomed to failure,&quot; and  avowing  theGovernments intention of respecting  the rights of neutrals, he  softly adds &quot; as far as our military requirements will permit,&quot; thus leaving open the same door as that which herr Michaelis seeks with the phrase &quot; as  I understand  them.&quot;   Judging by the latest statements  in the German press on the subject of  Alsace-Lorraine, the scheme  for the incorporation of the greater part of the ReicI island withthe Bavarian Palatinate and of the rest with the Prussian Rhine Province would appearto have been dropped.  On the 23rd the &quot; Weser &quot; announced that the provinces wereto be transformed into a Duchy, under a Regent.   On the 25th it was officially denied that any definite solution of the question had been reached.  According to &quot; Die Post &quot;of the 24th, the Alsace-Lorraine members  of the Reichstag wrere  received by  theChaucelior on the 23rd, and asked that the provinces  might become a Federal State.   The German wfireless of  the 27th states, on the authority of  Herr Mfiller, the newUnder-Secretary  of the Imperial Food Bureau, that according to present reports  the cereal  harvest  will be  amply sufficient for the country&apos;s needs ; the potato  crop is good, but the fodder crops  on by fair.  It  is hoped to  maintain the bread  ration, andthe meat ration may possibly be increased for a time.    With great care Germany can hope to hold out to the  harvest of 1918.   This statement is very different  from  thatsupplied from reliable unofficial sources and recorded in Reports Nos. 29  and  30.   The  &quot; Vossische&quot; of  22nd  August  repiorts  a  rumour  to the effect that  theauthorities in  Berlin propose to prohibit the use of  baths in private dwellings  andthat there  wdll be no heating of  water in the public bathing establishments, owingto lack of coke ;  only for sick people certain hot water facilities will be provided.The  paper  blames  the  municipal  authorities  for their  want  of foresight  and organisation.   According to a report quoted  in the last &quot; Summary of  Blockade Information,&quot;there is enough copper in Germany to  meet  the requirements of the essential war industries,  but the monthly deliveries of steel are short by more than 100,000 tons amonth, and the shortage of  nickel constitutes  a  very grave  problem.   The  collieryoutput, except in Westphalia, seldom rises above 60 per cent, of the normal, althoughRussian, Serbian, and Polish prisoners are extensively used for mine labour.  Thisreport does not anticipate any serious lack of essential materials in Germany&apos;s war industries for the next six months.                       AUSTRO-HUNG ARIAN AFFAIRS.   Concerning the  personality and previous  record  of Herr  Wekerle,1 the  newHungarian Premier, Sir W. Townley reports that he lias the  advantage of being abourgeois,  which  confers  a sort of  prestige  upon  a statesman in Hungary.  His  1 Herr Wekerie lias been Premier twice before ; first at the end of 1892 and again from 1906-1909.
reputation  has been made chiefly as an economist and  financier.  He was one of theoriginal founders of the Central-Europe Economic Association.  His policy as regards-Germany and  the Zollverein has always been  to  make Austria-Hungary so strongeconomically that she may stand on her own feet and prevent Germany from becomingthe predominant  partner,  at A.ustria&apos;.s expense, in the Mittel-Europa combination.Nevertheless,die favours the German Alliance and a long-term commercial treaty withGermany.  He is widely identified with agricultural interests.  In the matter of untruth-fulness he is said to be able to hold his own with any German.    Hungarian feeling has been deeply stirred by the disclosure of the fact that CountCzernin, the joint Austro-Hungarian  Minister for Foreign Affairs, recently  protested against  the appointment of Count Andrassy as Hungarian Prime Minister.   This istreated  as an unjustifiable intervention  in Hungarian  domestic  affairs, and CountAndrassy&apos;s  political opponents, Tisza&apos;s Party of  Work,  are  themselves taking theinitiative  in bringing the  matter before Parliament.   As  Tisza&apos;s  fall was broughtabout by C-zernin, this will give them an opportunity for pajnng off old scores, whileposing as the  champions of  Hungarian independence.  Incidentally, Sir W. Townleythinksj this may strengthen German intrigues  against Czernin, who has  never  beenpopular in Berlin.                                   HOLLAND.    The  Restriction  of Enemy Supplies Department  have  pointed  out  to  their representative at the Hague  (Mr.  Laming)  that  the  Landbouw Export Bureaustatistics for June and July show that Holland has exported to Germany in thesetwo months 5,851 tons of  cheese in excess  of the amount  (in proportion to thatsupplied to Great Britain) which the agreement allows.   His Majesty&apos;s Governmentare profoundly dissatisfied  at this, and  anxiously  await  assurances that no furtherexports to Germany will take place until  the  quantity due  to Great Britain has beenmade good.    The position of cattle owners and meat exporters is not a pleasant one.  In theabsence of  fodder, it has  become a matter of imperative necessity for farmers to get rid of a considerable  proportion of their stock.  If the Landbouw Export Bureau areunable  to  conclude arrangements with  the British authorities for the export of  meat to Great Britain,  and  possibly France, they will  be compelled either  to  terminate theexisting agreement or to violate  it by exporting to Germany all their  surplus meat.A despatch from Sir W. Townley (23rd August) emphasises the importance of renderingassistance  to  the  Lanclbouw Export Bureau, especially in  the allotment of tonnage,because the Germans, and a certain group  of pro-German Dutch officials  and others,are playing a  waiting game, hoping that the agreement with  Great Britain will fall.through and  that they will then be able, to impose  their own terms on the Dutchexporters.   The difficulty of the Bureaifs position is aggravated by the  fact  that theyare afraid to  come to  England  to negotiate  lest, in  their absence, the pro-Germangroup  on  the Commission of Advice  should  conclude arrangements  favourable toGermany, as they did in the case of the potato export.    In view of the fact that Germany is demanding excessive compensation  for thesmall amount  of coal  she is  able to offer Holland., His Majesty&apos;s Government  considerit advisable to make new  proposals to the Dutch, embodying the two questions ofcoal and tonnage in a manner  calculated to be acceptable to them.   The  proposed arrangements have been drafted in detail,  but before communicating them to theNetherlands  Government,   the  Foreign  Office has directed  Sir  C.  Spring  Rice(28th August) to  submit them  for the approval  of the  Government  of the UnitedStates.                                SWITZERLAND.    It appears that the new Swiss-German  Convention was not signed on 20th August(as stated in last Report, upon the authority of an official despatch), but only initialledby its negotiators.  On the  22nd  His Majesty&apos;s Minister  reported that ratification ofthe Convention has been suspended for the reason that the swiss Banks are  unwilling to execute the German loan undertakings, unless assured that  the reprisals threatened by the Allies will not be carried out.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs  has  thereforerequested Sir  H. Rumbold to give him an assurance that the Swiss Banks co-operating in the agreement will not be deprived of their postal, cable and other facilities.   The
Swiss  Government,  it, seems, are quite prepared to make  with the Allies financial arrangements similar to those concluded with Germany.                                    SWEDEN.    At a recent interview with Lord Robert  Cecil at the Foreign Office, the  Swedish Minister enquired whether  His Majesty&apos;s Government were really considering the question  of  denouncing the  most-favoured-nation  clause  in the Anglo-Swedish Commercial Treaties.   Lord Robert Cecil admitted  the difficulty of denouncing any single clause in a treaty,  but  said  it would be possible for  His Majesty&apos;s Government to  propose the renewal  of the commercial treaty,  omitting  this particular clause, which a considerable section of public opinion in  Great Britain  regarded as working unfairly from the British point  of  view.   The  Swedish Minister asked  whether the change  in British commercial policy was  regarded  as imminent.  Lord Robert Cecil replied  that  the question was under consideration.   A. Committee  on  Imperial Preference is to  be  convened  by  the  Colonial Office to deal with questions closely connected with this subject, and some  action  would  undoubtedly be taken,  but its ultimate results could not be foretold.    Discussing the food situation in Sweden with His Majesty&apos;s Minister on 22nd August, the Minister for Foreign  Affairs said that,  in the absence of cattle fodder and cereals for live  stock, it  would be necessary to slaughter a large number of cattle this winter. He did not think it would be  possible for  Russia  to  take many animals (as suggested by Sir  E.  Howard) in return  for oil-cake,  as transport difficulties would prevent Russia from exporting this article  on a large scale.   Also, he thought, Sweden must have something to send to Germany in exchange for  coal.  The arrangement in force between Sweden and  Germany up to July had been that  Sweden was to receive 150,000 tons of coal a month  against certain quantities of meat,  and that any coal supplied in excess of this quantity  was in  a general way regarded as  compensation for iron  ore.   Sir E. Howard points out that this amounts to an admission that when (as in  the first four months of 1917) Germany was sending Sweden less than  150,000 tons of  coal a month,  Sweden  was supplying iron ore without compensation.    Discussing the foreign policy of Sweden before a large audience on 22nd August, the Minister  for  Foreign Affairs said,  inter alia, that if the United States  were to make a  demand for the complete cessation of Swederds commercial relations with the Central  Powers,  it would be refused.  He  reiterated the statement that Sweden would make no agreement  with any  belligerent Power that would  entail  severance  of her commercial relations  with the other  belligerents.   Sir E. Howard observes that the speech was primarily for election purposes.    It is rumoured in financial, circles at Stockholm that the Government  intend to issue a  decree  prohibiting Swedish banking  institutions from making any loans to foreigners or foreign  countries and ordering that  current loans shall not be renewed upon expiry.    Under strong pressure of  instructions  from his Government, the Russian Minister at  Stockholm has concluded  the arrangement (referred to in  last week&apos;s Report) for the export of 20,000 tons of Russian oil-cake to  Sweden against a consignment of steel shell casings.    With a view to removing the existing congestion of goods from England in transit for Russia (of   which there were over  23,000  tons on  1st August), His Majesty&apos;s Minister was  authorised  last month to agree  in particular  cases  that  the Swedish authorities might retain  15 per cent, of such transit  goods in return for forwarding the remainder to  Russia.   The Swedish Government, however, demanded that  30 per cent, of  the goods should remain  in Sweden; they were prepared  to accept 15 per cent, only in  the case of fatty acids.   Anticipating  that acceptance of this demand might hamper the United States Government in  their negotiations with Sweden, His Majesty&apos;s  Government thought it best  to refuse  it,  and Sir C. Spring  Rice was informed accordingly ; at the same time Sir E. Howard was  directed to intimate to the Swedish Government that tactics of this  kind are likely to involve them in  severe economic  losses  in  the  future.   The  Russian Government  pointed out  that the deduction of a percentage of  goods presents  serious difficulties, as in each case the consent  of individual owners has to be  obtained ;  they suggested  that it would be preferable, if  possible, to give Sweden  certain import facilities in  return  for transit.: Sir E. Howard stated on  the 21th that  traffic  could  easily be increased  but  for the&quot; difficulty of obtaining transit licences.     3657-5                             TJ
1-4                                   NORWAY.   The Norwegian delegates  at Washington  are  endeavouring  to  come to  art.arrangement with  the  United States  Government  for imports  of  meat.    At thesame time steps are being  taken  to  make contracts, if possible, for supplies  from denmark.   The Norwegian Press (25th  August) states that the  United States Governmenthave,offered to issue licences for 50,000 tons &quot;of  grain to replace the quantity diverted from Norwegian cargoes to Belgian Relief purposes.   Sir M.  Findlay observes that if(as is asserted in certain official quarters) the Norwegian Government intend to provetheir neutrality and to establish a plea of force majeure by resistance to United Statespressure up  to the point of real or  simulated starvation, the sooner this point  isreached the better for all concerned.   For this reason, and because every ton of grainreceived by Norway postpones the complete  cessation of Norwegian  exports to theenemy, he considers that no grain or flour should be  sent to Norway from the UnitedStates.  Sir M. Findlay suggests that, with a view to checking the  requirements  neutrals and for the general purposes of  blockade negotiations, the United StatesGovernment should be  urged to insist  that weekly statistics  of all  exports shouldbe regularly supplied  to  Allied  representatives  in Scandinavia.    Even  shouldScandinavian exports to  the enemy be entirely stopped, such  statistics would still benecessary in order to enable the Allies to keep  track  of exports  to other  neutral countries  adjoining Germany.                                     SPAIN.   His  Majesty&apos;s  Ambassador at Madrid has been instructed,  to urge the SpanishGovernment  to institute regular  patrols  of  their  territorial waters, between thenorthern ports, where iron-ore is  shipped,  and the French frontier,  and between the-southern ports and Gibraltar, for the protection of merchant shipping.  between 1st April  and the  end  of July there were 27 cases in which all the  evidence  proved that  attacks  by  German  submarines  had been   committed  in Spanish  territorial waters.   His Majesty&apos;s Government point out that as they have recently agreed to-provide Spain with an increased supply of coal for the-naval patrol service, they have aright to ask that the Spanish Government shall provide the requisite  protection for shipping within their territorial waters.   The Intelligence Bureau&apos;s Report of 21st August ascribes the failure of the recentanarchist  and  revolutionary movement to several causes.  In the first place to thefact that the noisy agitators and extremists are in  no sense representative of the  greatbody of the people, the inarticulate, politically unconscious masses, who know and care so  little about politics that they wall not take the trouble  to vote.  Secondly, thearmy has  shown itself  to  be loyal and  the  politicians are  not  inclined  to  go toextremes.  The army succeeded  in attaining its  immediate and professional objectsin its recent trial  of strength with the Government, and having done so, reverted tothe anti-revolutionary position naturally to  be  expected from its class traditions andbias.   It gave no support to the revolutionaries, but  on  the  contrary, maintained lawand  order.  The  Catalan Senators and Deputies adopted a  similar attitude, beinginfluenced rather  by regionalist than by revolutionary  motives,  and confident ofultimately attaining their objects  by constitutional methods.  The Maximalist policj&apos;-is therefore relegated to the  background  and the way lies open for a constitutional reform  of  the existing regime, if the King so wall, which wall make a reality of thepresent make-believe system.  For the present, failing a  dissolution,  Senor Datomust be dependent on the support of Count Romanones, a  position  not likely to lastlong.  He is  bound to  choose before long between genuine  democratic reform and.maintenance of the rotativist party system.   The  British Ambassador thinks that the-best opinion in Spain is  in favour of postponing constitutional questions till after thewar, but a strong section, of  pro-Ally opinion is undoubtedly  disposed  to urge theimmediate introduction of  a  genuine Parliamentary system  on British  lines.   Thedifficulty  with which Sehor Dato  and the Marquis Lema are  confronted  lies in thefact that they have to work  with a hierarchy of officials who are mostly pro-German,and  that genuine constitutional reform would be  opposed by the aristocratic, clericaland pro-German circles  in close touch with the Court.   If the King  decides to adhere to the existing system, the result may be that Sehor Besada, an inveterate pro-German,,
-will succeed Sefior Dato as Prime Minister.  The wiser policy would seem  to be for him to form a National Cabinet, supported, by Seilor Azcarrete and the Reformists.    Pending settlement of the question of the carriage of coal to Spain in Spanishships (vide-last Report),  His Majesty&apos;s Government have complied  with a requestmade by  the  Spanish Ambassador and have sanctioned the export of grapes to theUnited  Kingdom  up to 50 per cent, of the quantity shipped  in  1916.  Sehor Merrydel Val  has  been informed that this concession is made in the expectation that theSpanish Government will render all  possible  assistance in. the economical use oftonnage employed in the shipment of fruit.                                     CHINA.   With reference  to  the proposed  postponement  of  the  indemnity  payments,Mr. Alston  reported  on 25th August that the Russian  and  Italian Ministers  nowconsider that, as China has declared war against Germany without conditions, it-is nolonger necessary to make such great concessions as were  originally  contemplated.While anxious not to dissociate himself Horn the  action of the  Entente, the RussianMinister feared the loss of  revenue would be a serious matter for his Government, towhom he has therefore referred the question.  . It  will be remembered (vide ReportNo. 16)  that  in May last the Italian and Russian  Governments  instructed their ministers at Peking  to associate themselves with the British proposal to offer China,not only a postponement, but a remission, of the indemnity for the period of the warand five years thereafter,  to enable  the Premier to cany out his policy of declaring war against Germany.  Subsequently the Chinese, were advised by Japan that  theymight confidently rely on the good faith and generosity of the Allies.   The Chinese Government  have definitely decided not to sell the  ex-enemy ships,but to charter them to Chinese merchants, who will only be allowed to sub-charter  tothe Allies.                                    JAPAN.   The results of the American embargo on the  export  of steel are rapidly becomingmanifest in shipbuilding and industrial circles  in Japan ; a significant feature of thesituation, reflecting the general agitation, has been the  publication of two  importantarticles by the &quot; Jiji Shimpo,&quot; upbraiding the  Japanese  people for  being lukewarmabout the war and urging the immediate provision of help for the Allies in the shape of tonnage in  the Atlantic.   Sir C. Greene thinks that the pressure which political parties of all  shades are bringing to bear  on  the Japanese Government is likely toresTilt in a release of shipping for the war purposes of the Allies.   Discussing this question with the French Minister on 23rd August, the Ministerfor Foreign Affairs attempted to justify the position of  the  Japanese Government  byreferring to the  shipbuilding programme which he  had proposed  to Great  Britain(vide Report No. 25) and to which he had received no reply.  The  French Ministerobserved that what the Allies require  is not  construction schemes  but ships  in-commission.                                     [SI AM.   Public opinion in Siam is strongly in favour of retention of the ex-enemy ships, toform  the  nucleus of a Siamese  mercantile fleet after  the war.  The government therefore propose not to sell the ships but to charter them, in accordance with  thealternative arrangements proposed by His Majesty&apos;s Government, a certain proportionof the tonnage  being allotted to  France  and Japan   respectively.   The SiameseGovernment do not wdsh to bargain  about the  charter rate offered  by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment (15s. per gross ton), but point out that it  works out at S5 .85, whereas the rate obtainable locally is about $28.   They are prepared to regard the differencebetween any rate offeree! them and the  market  rate as  Siam/s contribution  to  theAllies&apos; cause.
                                 - ARGENTINA.    The Budget Bill laid before Congress on 20th August provides for the impositionof a tax of 50 cents  per register  ton  on sea-going vessels leaving Argentine ports;also for the abolition of free  ports in  the  southern portion of the Republic and anincrease in Customs dues.   It is  proposed to levy a 2  per cent, ad valorem exportduty on general cargo and specific duties (in gold) on horses, frozen meat, hides, skinsand wool, wheat and other cereals, &amp;c.   The Bill leaves to the Executive considerablediscretion  in the imposition or remission of these duties under special circumstances.    Anticipating a shortage of over three million tons in the supplies of grain available,exclusive of  the  Argentine crop, for the  needs  of allies  and neutrals, the FrenchGovernment have submitted a scheme for joint purchase of the  surplus grain in argentina, estimated at 2-1- to 3g- million tons.   The scheme, as communicated toHis Majesty&apos;s  Government,  involves  financial  and. other arrangements with  theGovernment of  Argentina&apos; of a*nature  not likely  to be readily  concluded  by  thatcountry except under blockade pressure more or less severe.  Without the co-operationof the United States it is confessedly impracticable.   On the 23rd, Sir C. Spring Ricewas instructed to submit&apos;the details of the scheme confidentially to Air. Hoover and toask whether  in his opinion there is any prospect of the United States Governmentco-operating to make it effective.  On the 28th, Mr.  Hoover&apos;s reply was communicated by  the Ambassador.   He concurs  in  the opinion, that the maximum supply of grainby  the United States and Canada to the  Allies  will fall short of their requirements byabout  the equivalent of  the  estimated  surplus in the Argentine.  He  has therefore recommended to the  State Department that  the Argentine Government  should be induced to reserve its surplus for  the Allies, and  that &quot; coal, agricultural  machinery,and other products of:  American labour &quot; should  only be allowed to go to Argentinaon this condition.  Sir C. Spring Rice observes that  the financial details  of the scheme will have to be submitted to  Mr. McAdoo in order  to  ascertain whether the UnitedStates  Government will co-operate financially.                                    BRAZIL.   Sir A..  Reel reports (25th  August) that  considerable  embarrassment  is  beingcaused  in  political circles  by  the  pressure  which  influential  Brazilian  firms areexercising  to  have  their names removed  from  the  statutory list.  His  Majesty&apos;minister suggests, as  a measure likely to  be  popular and at the same time effective,that the statutory list be revised, by a Commission  consisting of representatives  ofthe Allied  countries and  of  Brazil, and  that this Commission  should be consulted before any new names are added  to the list.   In this  way the Brazilian Governmentwould virtually become responsible for the prevention of trading with the enemy.   The  Brazilian Government have  decided  not to  charter the ex-German ships  tothe French. Government, on the plea  that  they must  hold them in. trust for Germany,and  return them after  the  war.  Meanwhile,  to demonstrate  their  community  of interests with  the  Allies, they propose to  use  these vessels, together with  BrazilianLloyd ships,  to establish  a regular line of steamers  to  Europe.  Sir A. Peel  reportsthat his  French colleague is  greatly annoyed  by the  Brazilian Governments concern for German interests,  and considers  that, to  be consistent, they should declare war against Germany.                                   URUGUAY.   Early in August, His Majesty&apos;s Minister at Montevideo  was directed, in concert with his French colleague, to request that British and French, worships might  begranted  facilities in visiting Uruguayan  ports similar to  those  conceded to UnitedStates vessels.   Invited to join in this demarche, the State Department at Washingtonhas  declined  to do-so, on  the ground  that  the attitude  of the  South american republics is to accord favourable treatment to  the United States, based on the idea ofPan-American  unity and.  sympathy.  There  is  evidently  life left in the monroe doctrine.
   After considerable discussion, in the course of which much stress was laid  on thefailure of the Entente  Powers to treat the smaller States of South America with the respect due to their sovereignty or to give solid  proofs of unalterable friendship, theMinister for Foreign Affairs  has  assured His Majesty&apos;s Minister that he will use his influence to induce his colleagues tc terminate TJruguay&apos;s neutrality in favour  of theAllies  and to requisition the German ships, if England, France  and Italy  will enterinto an arbitration treaty (as proposed by Mr. Mitchell limes in 1914) and will  agreeto allow all outstanding questions to be settled, without further diplomatic interference,by the local Courts.                                 VENEZUELA.   Two  pro-Ally  newspapers  have  been  summarily  suppressed, without  reasonsassigned, by the President Elect, and one of their contributors has been imprisoned.Air. Beaumont observes that this exhibition of tyranny is calculated to increase  thegeneral tendency to  revolt induced  by similar acts  on  the  part of General Gomez.Both papers had avoided all questions of internal politics ;  their offence would appearto lie  in having  published arguments  in favour  of  Venezuela^ abandonment of neutrality.                               UNITED  STATES.    The  British and  French  Governments have  discussed  the  establishment  of an  - Inter-Allied Military  Council for the centralisation and control of Allied purchases in - the  United States, and  have come to an agreement  on lines  following generally Mr. McAdoo&apos;s proposals on the subject (vide Reports Nos. 26, 28 and 29).  It is agreed that, with a view to  administrative efficiency, the  Council will work  chiefly  through sub-committees, utilising  as  far  as  possible the  existing organisations in  London. The British and French Governments are agreed that  the  Council should  sit in London, and hope that its Chairman may be nominated  by the United States  Govern- ment; each country  concerned should  be  represented by at  least two  delegates. Sir C. Spring Rice  has been instructed (29th August) to  communicate these con- bid si dhs to the United States Government, and  to urge that they should agree to be represented  on the  Council,  even if  only by assessors.  It is  understood  that the French Governments assent to Mr. McAdoo&apos;s proposals is conditional on the United- States  being  represented.  The Italian  and Russian   Governments  are  also  being requested to assent to the proposed organisation of the Council.    Sir C. Spring Rice reported on the 24th that up till  now  the chief  difficulty iu the matter  of  organising and emphasising the American Governments blockade  policy has lain in the aloofness  of  the  President and the timidity of  the Departments in putting  before him  any facts that  might  conflict with  his  preconceptions.   This difficulty, however, has now been to a great extent eliminated because Mr. MacCormick, who has great influence with the President, is gradually assuming  the position of Blockade Minister.   He has begun preliminary discussions with neutral representatives on lines  that promise to be speedily effective.  In the case of Sweden he has intimated, inter alia, that the United States will take all her  export of iron ore and that  no more must go to Germany.  He is also taking up the subject of transit trade to Russia.  It is expected that  the Government will  entirely  prohibit the export of  cotton  to Scandinavia and Holland within the next fortnight.   Acting upon the recommendations of Mr.  Hoover, steps  have been taken,  in concert with the French, to set up an executive for the buying of meats and fats on behalf of the Allies in America, under conditions similar to those applied to wheat.  The- Ministry of Food  have  completed a provisional agreement with French delegates in the matter, and have submitted it  to  the French and  Italian Governments  for approval.   It isproposed to appoint  forthwith a single buying agenc3r for bacon, hams  and  lard in the United States.    It is understood that the Japanese Mission to the United States will  confine itselfto the discussion of matters arising directly out of the war, e.g., the tonnage question and blockade policy,  it has been  mutually agreed,  says Sir C. Spring  Rice, thatoutstanding questions, such as the  situation in China and the  Californian problem, will not be raised.3057 5E
   His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador reports a general stiffening  of  public opinion againstthe recrudescence of pacifist agitation, and particularly against the defiant and openlytreasonable  attitude of the German-American Press.  The pacifists, who have been prevented from going to  Stockholm by the  Governments veto, are organising  aConference at Minneapolis  in September under the leadership of  Senator  La Toilette.Patriotic societies are being formed to oppose these pernicious activities.                         THE SHIPPING SITUATION.   In placing before the Australian Commonwealth Government the general, principles on which the shipping policy of His Majesty&apos;s  Government is based (vide  supra), thefollowing  facts and figures were cited : From August  to  December 1916  imports into the United Kingdom averaged  31  million tons a month.   The essential  require-ments (allowing for large increase of munitions) still exceed 3 million tons monthly.The  importing  capacity  for  the  last  five months ; averages  only 2f- million  tons.Between, the 1st of January and the end of June the net losses of British tonnage dueto war risks amounted to  1-g- million tons.   At the end of July the number  of steamersover 1,600 tons register,  available  for  bringing cargo to the United Kingdom, wasabout 1,200.  The total losses, including  marine risks, may be reckoned at 5 million tons for the year, against which the augmented rate of new  tonnage production mayhe placed at 21 million, tons, leaving a net loss oil 21 million tons for the year.   Withall possible economy in the use of tonnage, this represents a loss of importing powerof 15 million tons, or about the equivalent of all foodstuffs imported during 19.16.   A German wireless of the 24th states  that the present number of effective german submarines is 10 per cent, higher than at the  beginning of unrestricted warfare inFebruary.   The amount of Allied tonnage sunk during the past six months is statedto be  5s- million tons, gross  register, or  920,000 tons a  month.  According to theSecretary of the Navy, the figures quoted  by Mr. Llo)-d George in regard to Englishlosses  (and those in &quot; The  Times &quot; of 4th August) bear out  the  statements of. theGerman Admiralty staff if allowance be made  for the  difference  between gross and net  registered tonnage.  In  the  opinion, of  many U-boat commanders,  submarine warfare is waged  under most favourable conditions when the weather is not too fineand when the nights are  long.    On  26th August  Sir C. Spring  Rice  reported that Mr. Denman (ex-Chairman  ofthe Shipping Board) is carrying on a vigorous propaganda to  induce the Governmentto take over the British ships  under construction in  American yards.  He  takes theline that as in. May last the British Government generously offered to turn over thesebuilding contracts to the United States, it is absurd for United. States officials nowr tosuggest releasing them.   In  this  connection, a letter was addressed by Mr. Balfourto the American.  Ambassador  on  16th August  recapitulating  the  course of  his negotiations on  the  subject in America and especially with Mr. Denman.  After clearly defining the British Government^ position and the unassailable reasons  which justified the placing of large British orders with American shipbuilders before A.merica&apos;s entry into the -war, Mr. Balfour had stated at Washington that under no circumstances would the British Government enter into controversy with  the State Department  on the question of ownership, hut that they would rely implicitly upon the goodwill and justice  of the United States authorities.  Mr.  Balfour, in  his  letter to  Mr.  Page, states that Great Britain will adhere  to this  policy.   He  points  out, however, that if Great  Britaiits  policy towards  her  Allies  in  this matter  were to he taken as  a precedent, the United States could  not  lay claim to  Ownership in  the British ships now  building in American  yards;  for Great Britain, while requisitioning ships building in British yards to the order  of neutrals, has made no claim to ownership in the case of vessels building for  Allies.   Upon Great Britain has fallen  the brunt of the submarine campaign ;  she has provided  the  bulk of sea-borne traffic since the  beginning of the war.   Without the ships now building to British orders in America,  it must be difficult for England to tide over the critical period now approaching, and it would therefore be a matter for gratification if the United  States Government were  to find it consistent with the claims  of their own national  interests to  leave these vessels in their present ownership.     In transmitting this  letter  by telegraph  to Sir C. Spring Rice on 22nd August, the Foreign Office observed that the  pledge  given  by Mr. Balfour  must be strictly observed in all negotiations on the subject.   At the same time, it must be made clear to the United States Government that, if they insist  on claiming  these vessels, it will
not be possible for  Great Britain to replace them from her own resources, and  thattheir loss will seriously embarrass the country&apos;s naval aud military activities.                             PEACE DISCUSSIONS.    The Intelligence Bureau&apos;s Weeldy Report on  Poland for 24th. August draws attention to the motives which may have underlain the wording of the Pope&apos;s referenceto Poland in his Note.  &quot; The territories  forming part  of  the  ancient  Kingdom  ofPoland &quot; would include the non-Polish, but  Roman Catholic territories  of  Lithuaniaand White Russia, and also the largely Uniate Ukrainian territories  of Volhynia andGalicia.   Over a year ago Count  Ledochowski, General of the Jesuits,  in a private conversation, said that the most desirable  thing in his view, and, he  hinted, in that ofthe Vatican, was the  detachment from Russia of all  her Catholic territories.  Nodoubt, too, Germany is encouraging  Polish  Imperialism in this direction in order to diminish Polish disappointment at P.russia&apos;s determination to  make  no concession  inrespect of Posen.  The Report also draws  attention to the  use Austria is making ofthe  Poles  for  the  purposes  of her  peace  campaign and  describes  Switzerland  as&quot; humming with Polish intrigues.&quot;    Information received from reliable sources in Scandinavia points to the conclusionthat if the Allied Socialists, especially the  French and British, are not represented  at stockholm, the Conference is not likely to take place and that  in any case it will notbe possible for it to meet on  9th September.   Although Mr. Branting has announced his intention of taking part  in the Conference, even if only Russians, Germans andneutrals  are represented, it  appears probable that  he will abandon this intention,for the reason that the Swedish and Norwegian Socialists have no  desire to promote a discussion dominated by the Germans.   According to the account of  an interview with the Russian delegate Axelrod, published in the &quot; Politiken &quot;, on 28th August,the Sovyet desires that  the resolutions  of the Conference should  be  binding, but should this prove to be impossible they would like to hold a consultative Conferenceon  this occasion, to be followed by one whose resolutions should be binding.    The Germans in Belgium have for some time past been urging Belgian Socialiststo  attend the Stockholm Conference.  AI.  Bertrand, their leader,  replied that this could not be clone without a mandate from the party, which could not be given unless a meeting were held free from German  supervision.  The Germans finally allowedthis meeting to  take place, with the  result that by a  practically unanimous vote (two-dissentients in  a meeting of nearly 500 delegates) it was decided  that even  if theBritish, French and Italian. Socialists  go to  Stockholm, the Belgians decline to be present  at  the  Conference.   This  decision  was recorded  as  a  protest  againstGermany&apos;s treatment of  Belgium and in order to maintain the  determination of theBelgian Army in the field.    Mr. Huysmans&apos; request for facilities to land in  England (vide last  Report) wasevidently put forward in the hope that it might be refused and provide him with  anopportunity for  denouncing  the  British  Governments injustice.   On  24th  AugustSir E. Howard was instructed to  viaer his passport  and give  him a passage in theofficial boat, which he declined, on the ground that it was too late for him to attend the Conference in London.  In applying to  goto England, AI. Huysmans had statedthat his presence was required at  the Havre, where the  Belgian Government  desiredhis advice in  framing the Bill on the Flemish educational question.  Enquiries atHavre elicited the fact that the Belgian Government did not desire his presence either at the Havre or in England.    The Papal Peace Note continues  to elicit  various opinions from the Allied Powers.The Russian Alinister  for Foreign Affairs  regards it as an attempt on the part of theCentral Powers to make peace with  the Allies at Russia&apos;s expense, and considers thatthe Entente&apos;s reply should take the form of a collective Note. The Italian government desire to  stipulate that  the  Allies&apos;  reply should contain  some reference  to Italianclaims  against  Austria.   The Spanish  Government,  while   expressing  academicsympathy with the Pope&apos;s proposals, consider them  impracticable and will therefore not support them.  The Spanish Government were not formally  consulted by  theA^atican  on the  subject, but there are  grounds  for believing that  the  German and austrian Ambassadors had  foreshadowed the  Pope&apos;s proposals in  conversation withHis Afajesty  the King  and  the  Minister  for Foreign Affairs.  The  &quot; Temps&quot;  of,26th August  called  upon   the  French  Government   to reply  publicly  to  theA^aticaifs  proposals,  and  to  declare   that  the  German  Governments  attitude
of silence  or  ambiguity on  essential  questions  of  restitution  and  reparationmakes  it  impossible  for  the Allies  to  open  any discussion  with  them.  NoFrenchman,  it   declares,  can  accept  as  a  basis  of  discussion   any  formula which  leaves  any  doubt  whatsoever   as  to  the  future  of  Alsace-Lorraine.All these  questions  have  now been simplified, and the situation, generally cleared,.by the publication of  President Wilsons  reply to His Holiness, transmitted through his  Majesty&apos;s representative at  the Vatican on  29th&apos; August,  a document  whichemphasises the  fundamental fact that it is useless to  discuss peace with the presentrulers of Germany, inasmuch as  their word  cannot  be accepted as &quot; a guarantee  of&quot; anything that  is  to endure, unless supported by such conclusive evidence  of the&quot; will and purpose of  the  German people  themselves  as the other  peoples  of the&quot; world would be justified  in  accepting.&quot;   The general tenour of Mr. Wilsoids pro-posed reply formed the  subject  of  communications between the White House and theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs between 20th and 26th. August.   Passports  to  the  official  Italian Socialists proceeding to the London conference were  issued by the  Minister of the Interior ;  among them, as  Sir R. Rodd points out,are some  extreme opponents of the war,  including  the  Editor of &quot; Avanti.&quot;  Baron.Sonnino was personally opposed to the issue of their  passports.   Similarly, in Paris,two Ivienthalist Socialists, to whom M. Ribot refused passports, were recommended  to-the Permit Office by the Minister for Foreign Affairs.                                  GENERAL.   Being convinced that another winter of captivity in Austria-Hungary, under thesame conditions as the last, will mean death for  thousands of Serbian prisoners, theSerbian Government have asked for the  support of His Majesty&apos;s Government with aview to obtaining the  consent of the  Swiss  Government to the internment of these prisoners in Switzerland.  The  assistance  of the  French  and United States government-ments has also been invoked.  The Serbian Government have good reason to believethat  the  swiss Government  are prepared  to do what is required provided that theAllies  will  undertake to supply food for  the Serbian  prisoners  in  question.  sir h. Rumbold was instructed (24th August) to ascertain the views of the swiss Govern-ment on the subject.   In the meanwhile, being greatly concerned at  the shortage of flour required for the Serbian section  of the Bureau de Secours at Berne, His Majesty&apos;.sGovernment have directed Lord Bertie tec say that the 100  tons a week now sent fromGeneral Headquarters in France to the British and Serbian sections will be increased to175 tons if the French Government will grant the necessary transport facilities.   At a Conference between Austrian and Russian delegates at Stockholm on 4th and6th  August,  it was   stated  (and  subsequently  announced in the  Press)  that anagreement has been  reached   between the  two countries&apos;  Governments  for theimmediate exchange of aged or sick prisoners of war, and  that negotiations would becontinued for the exchange of all prisoners captured before a certain date (to be fixedlater) and of all civilians and hostages.   The Austrian, delegate was commissioned  toobtain from the German authorities the necessary guarantees for the safety of  vessels which  the  Swedish  Red  Cross proposed  to employ  in  the  transport by  sea  ofexchanged prisoners,  to the  number  of 4,000 a month.  General  Ludendorff  repliedthat it was not possible to guarantee the absolute  safety of such vessels, or  to agreeto exchanges being effected by sea  ;  he  therefore  proposed  that  a little neutralexchange zone should be established in the  district of Pinsk, where good railwayconnections are available.
