SECRET.    APPRECIATION  OF  THE  ATTACHED  WESTERN  AND  GENERAL     .&apos;  ,  -    -              ;   REPORT, No.  27.  .    -   -                             CANADA.   The suggestion that an eminent French or Belgian ecclesiastic should visit canadian -order . to  persuade  Quebec not to put  itself  into opposition with the national  ,sentiment of  the rest of  the Dominion, indicates  the  urgent need of some effort beingmade, on  lines  outside the  ordinary grooves of Canadian party politics, to avert  acleavage which would have, disastrous effects on the whole  future national life  ofCanada.    The financial  crisis  has been tided over for a few weeks.  But the fundamentalproblem, discussed  in  the Appreciation  to  Report  No. 25, still remains :  are we toallow technical exchange difficulties to prevent our making the  utmost use of Canada&apos;resources and industrial power during this war?                                    AUSTRALIA.    The telegram from the  Commonwealth Government  urging that  greater effect should be  given  to  Australian  National  feeling in the  constitution  of Australianfighting formations and  in  other  matters is very significant.  What  Australiansentiment asks,  in fact, is that the Australian Force, like the Canadian, should  forma  single unit at  the  front.   Australians believe that their  divisions  fight bettertogether than when distributed among British  divisions in  British corps.   The other demands  of  the Australian  Government  are,  in substance,  for a recognition of themilitary status  of the Australian  Forces  corresponding to  that already given in thecase of the Canadian Forces.                             ALLIED  COMMON AFFAIRS.    The Conference in Paris appears to have led to  no definite decisions with regardto the military  position  in the Balkans.  This was, perhaps,  only to  he expected inview of the character of  the  Conference.                                      ITALY.    The situation with regard  to the Italian  coal  supply deserves  the most careful study.  It is little exaggeration to say that the whole attitude of the Italian publictowards the  war will be determined in the  next six months  by the extent to whichthis problem can be solved.                              ALLIED ENEMY  AFFAIRS.     Vienna and Berlin are evidently playing up to each other quite as effectively sincethe change in  the German  Chancellorship as  before.  Count Czernin hastens to lay stress on  the   lucidity  of  lierr  Michaelis&apos;s  statement.   Herr   Michaelis,  in  thismorning&apos;s papers, dwells on the indissoluble nature of the Austro-German  union bothnow and hereafter.   It  would be a  mistake to treat  this as  mere eyewash.  Thepermanent unity of Middle Europe is  a  settled  purpose  on the part of Governments and of peoples (at least as far as Germans and  Magyars  are concerned)  in bothEmpires, and  furnishes  the key to  all  their actious.  The  two Governments may differ; they may even  intrigue  for advantages over each other; but they are not going to separate.
                                GERMAN  AFFAIRS.   The attitude of  the Centre Parly over the question of Parliamentary Governmentin Germany shows how inextricably that question  is  bound up with the nature of  theGerman  Federal Constitution.   The  Reichstag is  elected  on  the  widest  possiblefranchise over the whole  of Germany regardless of  State  differences.  As  long as it remains a debating  assembly in  which the views  of  the Imperial. Government  areexpounded and criticised, it does not  affect the essential character of... that government as one by conference and  arrangement  between more or  less sovereign.states.  Themoment  it controls  the Government, Germany becomes  in  essentials a unitary state.   To take  a parallel from  our own  institutions:   there is nothing in the  present constitutional  organisation of  the British  Empire  which  would be affected by an imperial Assembly or Conference of Parliamentary Delegations in which the policy ofthe Imperial Cabinet was expounded  or criticised, as long as ultimate parliamentary control rested with  the Parliaments of the different self-governing 2?arts of the Empire,and the  members of. the  Imperial Cabinet remained responsible  to their respectiveParliaments.  But if that Assembly were given the  powers of a real Parliament thenundoubtedly the autonomy of the different Governments would to some extent belimited, and a true  Imperial Federation be created.   And that  parliamentarisation ofthe Imperial Assembly,  however  democratic  in principle,  might very possibly be opposed, on the plea of national autonomy, by the most democratic parties indifferentparts of the Empire.                                                     ;                                 A USTK r A-H UNO A ilY.   The peace programme of the Austrian Navy League is worth studying.  In viewof the many reports as to the  moral as well as the material exhaustion  of Austria-11 ungary, and the professed desire of  the Austro-Hungarian  Government for &quot; peace without  annexations,&quot; it  is interesting to  see that  there are, at any rate,  sections -ofopinion in the Dual  Monarchy -which  still cherish the idea of practically incorporatingRumania, Serbia, Montenegro,  and  Albania,  as  well  as of  rectifying  the Venetianfrontier at Italy&apos;s expense.                                  UNITED STATES.   The  negotiations for  the constitution  of an  Inter-Allied  Council- to  fix . thedemands for financial  assistance to be  laid  before the United  States,  and.  the telegrams on the exchange situation  deserve careful  study.                                PEACE DISCUSSIONS.                      .. .;    The position may be summed up  as follows : The French,  Russian, and  EnglishSocialists have  decided  to  take part  in the  proposed  international  Conference, at stockholm,  subject  to the ratification  of their decision  at  the Inter-Allied Socialist Conference in London,  MeanAvhile the French, Italian,  and American governments are stilt resolved to grant no passports to  the  Conference.  The British Governmenthas  declared in the House of Commons that it will  not officially  participate&quot;,  but  has given no indication as to whether it  will grant passports.  It  is  obviously  desirable. that the Allies should arrive at  a common policy on this issue without delay. .    No less  important is it. that  the other Governments  of the British Empire should be consulted before any step  is  taken in the direction of allowing  a&apos;  Conference between British and  enemy  subjects which, however unofficial, cannot  be without its effect on the terms of  peace.

PART  I.-BRITISH  EMPIRE AND AFRICA.                                  GENERAL.   With further reference to the transport of Australasian troops via Panama,1 theAdmiralty have replied  to the points raised  by the New Zealand Government.  they point out that the Panama  route can  only be used when the Governments of theCommonwealth and New Zealand  co-operate in the despatch of vessels, and  that asthe Australian ships  that were ready to sail at the same time  as  the  New Zealandvessels, on the recent  occasion to which attention  is called, were obliged to sail bythe Cape route, the Panama  route could not be used.  Other  New Zealand vesselssailing with Australian vessels can therefore proceed via, Panama, and the warships canthus convoy them  jointly from Colon  to the United Kingdom.   As to the particularNew Zealand ship  which has  been diverted to  the Cape route, the Admiralty pointout that this vessel was  not suitable for the transport of troops  beyond the Cape, andwhen transhipment has been effected, the ship may proceed writh cargo to the UnitedKingdom.   The Commonwealth  Government have  telegraphed (28th July)  that  they gatherthe Admiralty have decided not to send troops across the United States.  In any casethe Australian Ministers   prefer  the  troops  to  proceed  direct  instead  of  beingtranshipped.   The opinion is expressed that the.  increased, cost arising  from navalnecessities should  not be charged to the Commonwealth.                                   CANADA.   On 25th July the Dominion Mouse  of  Commons  approved the Resolution of theMinister of Finance relating to income tax.  Under the  Bill  dealing  with thissubject Sir Thomas White estimates that a revenue of  about  $20,000,000 per annumwill be raised for the duration of the war.   The Dominion Minister of  Finance  has now further explained  the position which,so far  as Canada is concerned,  represents the utmost that  is possible in regard to financial arrangements.2  As previously stated, the Dominion Government will advance to the  Imperial  Munitions  Board  $25,000,000 a  month for  July, August,  and september, but this  is made  conditional  upon the  British  Treasury furnishing theBoard with  $15,000,000 during each of those months from American sources.   It is pointed out that this can be  done, as the Imperial  Munitions Board and Canadianmanufacturers have purchased materials, &amp;c, in the United States represented by this sum.   The Canadian Minister is also willing to issue $50,000,000  in  Dominion notesas a loan to the British Treasury for the payment of the cheese purchases of  $40,000,000during  July, August, and  September, together with the repayment of  -$10,000,000advanced by the Dominion Government for War Office purchases of hay, flour, and oats.Expenditure apart from the  above  must, the Minister states,  be provided by theBritish Treasury, and in addition the Treasury must find  $.10,000,000 clue from theImperial Munitions Board to the Bank of Montreal  on 15th August,  and $5,000,000payable by the Board on 5th September to the Bank of Commerce.   On matters  being-carried through as indicated above, the Dominion  Government  will  furnish theImperial Munitions Board with $25,000,000 in October, and will also try and provide asimilar amount for November and December, if the  British Treasury  can furnish$15,000,000 from American sources for each of those months.   A meeting of 50 Labour  men from different parts of Ontario has been held atHamilton, and  it wras decided to establish an. Independent Labour Party.   Amongstthe items in the  programme of the new party are : Abolition of the Senate,  Statecontrol of Canada&apos;s banking and  credit system, adequate  and  equal pensions for disabled officers and soldiers and soldiers&apos; widows and  dependants.1 See Western and General &quot;Report for week ending 25th July 1917.2 See Western and General &quot;Report for week ending 18th- July 1917.
   With reference to the Convention which is to be held at Toronto on the 2nd and3rd August under the auspices of the &quot;Win the War Association,&quot;1 the  Committeesconvening  the meeting. state that the objects in view  are the immediate enforcement of the conscription measure, the formation  of a  National  non-partisan Government,and the union of all patriotic elements in the country, which place the winning of thewar above  all other considerations.   The editors of a number of  Ontario Liberal newspapers  have held a meeting atToronto, and passed a  Resolution in  favour of the Liberal Party in the Provincestanding for compulsoiy  military service.   They declared  that  no candidate  shouldbe supported who does not  favour the  compulsion, policy.  A further Resolutiondeclared  that  a  War Cabinet and  Government  representing both  Parties wasnecessary.   A western Liberal Convention will be held at Winnipeg next week when probablynearly 1,000 delegates from the Provinces of Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba.will be present.  The Province  of British Columbia wall not take part.    With regard to the suggestion that Cardinal Mercier or some other Prelate should visit Quebec in order to overcome the difficult situation there,2 Cardinal  Bourne wasconsulted on the matter and advised that the Archbishop of Paris should  be asked forhis views as to the possibility of a  visit  from  an eminent French ecclesiastic.   Thishas  now  been  done,  but  the  Archbishop of  Paris  has pointed  out  that, beforesuggesting any names of priests to undertake this difficult mission, he would wish to learn  whether the  proposal has  the  approval  of  the Archbishop of  Quebec andMontreal.   In any case he could not select Bishops for  the purpose, as it  is not in his power to do so, and he could  only suggest names.  The Archbishop  has  put  forwardone or two tentative suggestions pending further developments.  -  Lord Rhondda has placed certain facts before the Dominion Food  Controller inrelation to food supply.   These show that  the exportable surplus of Canadian wheat.for  1917-18 will be  less than the needs  of the-United Kingdom  by more  than 2,000,000  tons, and will be only one-third of  the combined necessities of the United Kingdom, France and Italy.  As to Canadian  bacon  and butter, the United Kingdom will need more  than the 80,000 tons of bacon and  5,000 tons of butter which were imported  in 1916, on account  of the  smaller quantities  of these commodities now imported  from  Denmark and Holland.   Further,  the  United Kingdom  will require about the  same amount as last year of oats and cheese,  viz., 88,000 tons of the former and 75,000 tons  of the latter.    The Ministry of Munitions have explained to  the Dominion Government that, owing to the necessity of equipping the United States Army with rifles, the factories engaged in the manufacture of  British rifles had to be transferred to the United States Government.  This has prevented placing the machinery  of the Ilion Factory at the disposal of the Dominion Government.    It is further pointed out that the matter of manufacturing rifles in Canada has been  considered at a  conference attended by Lieutenant-Colonel  Folger,  and.  the Army Council are not yet  in a position to  state the pattern  of rifle which will be required after the wrar.  Experience  may  necessitate  a  modification in design, so it is considered inadvisable  for the Canadian Government  to instal new machinery for rifle manufacture until after  the war.   Meantime the Army Council have  arranged to arm all Canadian  contingents who  are despatched for service in Europe, and the  supply of rifles for  this  purpose can be  met  from manufacturing  plant in  the  United Kingdom, which is considered sufficient  to equip  the British Forces during  the war.   It is suggested that the Dominion Government might divert  their plant to  the manufacture  of  machine  guns preferably  of the  Vickers type,  though  it is  feared that the difficulty of getting  the  required number of  gauges would involve  a delay.     The Dominion Government have been  informed  that  the military authorities are  in urgent need of a second quantity of  300 miles  of railways, and they would be glad  to know the probable dates  on which these  could  be delivered at  sea-board.  It is  pointed out that transport for the July shipments of  18,000 tons of rails has already  been furnished.     A Bill for assisting returned soldiers and sailors to settle on. the land has passed  the House of Commons.  This provides for a grant  of 160  acres of  land and a loan  of 500L to each man.1 See Western and General Report for week ending 25th July 1917.2 See Western and General Report for week ending 4th July 1917.
                               NEWFOUNDLAND.   The British Treasury are quite prepared to make the proposed advance1 to the Govern-ment of Newfoundland, but they mention  that it would be  a great help to them atthe present moment if the  Colony could raise  the  amount in America.   failing this, the Treasury would be glad  to know if  it is necessary  to provide funds inLondon for expenditure  in  the United Kingdom, or whether  it would be  equallyconvenient to receive the 250,000L in New York.   In reply to the protest against the proposal to move the Newfoundland battalion from Ayr to Barry2,  the Newfoundland  Government have  been informed  that  theremoval is only temporary and for the purpose of enabling the training of the men tobe conducted  in  association  with other troops under  the  supervision  of a GeneralOfficer who has just returned from France.  It is pointed out that the depot remains at Ayr.                       AUSTRALIAN  COMMONWEALTH.    The  Prime  Minister  of  the  Commonwealth has  given expression to his great anxiety to learn fuller details regarding  the submarine campaign.   He points out thatno information is given him beyond that which appears in the Press,  and he statesthat as the Dominions are as much concerned in the war as the United  Kingdom, fulland reliable information should be  given  to him for his guidance.  He gives  the assurance that such information would be treated as most secret.    The Commonwealth Government state that as the Australian troops  in the fightingline have for some time past exceeded 100,000 men, they wish to give effect  to  theNational feeling with tegard to their troops (particularly with  reference to the con-stitution of the fighting formations, and the  employment of Australian officers  on  the staffs)  by the appointment  of  a  senior Australian officer at the War Office, whowould  be able to ensure  closer touch with  Australian sentiment.  On receiving  theviews  of the British Government, the  Australian  Government will submit further details of their proposal.    As  the  British  Minister of Munitions expressed his willingness  to maintain  theprices  offered for wolfram scheelite and  molybdenite  until six months after the war had ended, the Australian Government have agreed  to acquire  the Australian  outputof these  minerals  as  sole agents for the British Government.  The Commonwealthauthorities indicate that  a long dated  contract with a minimum, price is  the onlymethod of developing the production of the minerals on a permanent basis, and ifthis is  effected it is believed that  Australian sources  wall  be  able to  supply  all  therequirements of the United Kingdom and the Allies.    The Minister for Repatriation, in  introducing the measure for the provision  of landfor  the returning  Australian  soldiers,  stated that  60,000,000L which includes  thevalue of land provided by the States, would be required for  the cost of land settlementof 40,000 soldiers.  The Minister now informs  the Secretary of State that he  admitsthe Federal  grant  for equipment  of 500Z. per man  is low, and  mentions that  theStates  -wish it raised to TOOL   The  matter has still to be decided.    The Army Council have  informed the Australian  Government that they will  beglad to accept as Cadets in the Royal Flying Corps the twelve  pilots that have been offered.  If the Commonwealth decide to select these candidates, the  Army council will be glad if they can arrange for passages and report their  date  of arrival.  Theregulations concerning the enrolment of  future candidates are now being considered.    As  the Union Government of  South Africa have stated that  their reserve of goldis very low, the British Government have asked the Australian  authorities if  they  canship 50O,O00Z. of this coin to South Africa.    The Commonwealth Government have cabled particulars of the shipping positionas it affects Australia in relation  to the  war requirements  of the  Allies, as they wishto have detailed information  with regard to  the action which the British government propose to adopt in order to deal with the present and future cargoes. The Australian1 See Western and General Report for week ending 25th July 1917.2 See Western and General Report for week ending 11th July 1917.                         B
Ministers furnish  details of  the  cargo  of  wheat, zinc  concentrates,  wool,  &amp;c,amounting to a grand total of 6,7^0,000 tons, that now awaits shipment, but they state that they theurselves have only 34 steamers, amounting to 200,000 tons.  these vessels are now in different parts of the world, but the Government propose to collectthem and use them in the  America-Australia wheat-hour trade.  Beyond this therewould be a few chartered and coastal  ships, and those which may be  built.  If all commonwealth controlled vessels are confined to carrying cargo between the  westerncoast of America  and  Australia, it is  estimated  that the aggregate total  of  702,000tons -will be  sufficient for the purpose  till July 191S.   The result is that there is alarge margin of cargo which the Commonwealth Government cannot see any prospectof shipping.   They therefore ask for an estimate of the  tonnage that may be expectedto  be available in the  first place to deal with the present cargoes, and secondly, to ship the produce for the period ending February 1918.   They also wish to know  theprobable time when such tonnage will he available and in what particular trade itshould  be  used.   The  Commonwealth further would  be glad to know the positionrespecting wheat.   It  is supposed  that mostly American, or Canadian  wheat is beingconsumed  at  present  by the  United Kingdom, and this, supplemented by the new british  harvest, will, it is assumed, enable requirements to be met for a time.  but before the date of  the  next American harvest it is thought that Australian wheat maybe required, and that  therefore, tonnage ought to be provided for this purpose from about October next.  On this assumption, and also assuming that  the Commonwealthshipping is used for the  America-Australia trade as  mentioned  above, the  Common-wealth Government believe that a large quantity of  wheat and flour could be sent tothe United Kingdom, and it is recognised that the situation.will be improved by  theuse  of  Norwegian  sailing  vessels,  as  already  suggested.   The  commonwealth government express the hope that the Shipping Controller will furnish them with  the names of all ships, with full partictdars, that it is  anticipated  will reach Australiaduring  the present month.  They wish to have  similar information  regarding  thefuture forwarded to them every week.   A Return has  been issued which shows that there  are 3,600 enemy subjects nowinterned, in Australia.                               SOUTH AFRICA.   With reference to the request that was made that  passports  should  not be issued to women to travel through  the danger zones except for urgent  reasons, the UnionMinisters point  out that they have  strictly carried, out  the  instructions,  and nopassports have been issued  to  women unless they came within  the categories laiddown by the British  Government, and in any case the number permitted on any onevessel has been limited to 15.   It was  therefore with great surprise that the UnionGovernment discovered that  in  the last four mail  steamers which have arrived from england within the last six weeks no less than 231  women, including some actresses,and 82 children, were on  board.  On one ship alone, out of 2,000 persons there were90 women and 38 children.   Under  these circumstances, the Union  Government find it impossible to maintain the  present restrictions, and indeed they now  find it hard to demonstrate that there is any  object in imposing any  restrictions whatever.  TheGovernment are therefore proceeding to issue passports to women who  wush to returnto England, but they would be glad to hear from the  British Government their views as to future restrictions.   If it is wished to  maintain any restrictions the UnionGovernment would be  glad if passports  to South Africa  might be limited to Avomenwho are  domiciled in that country.   As to the raising of a second mounted regiment  for service  in East Africa&quot;2, theArmy Council have conveyed their  desire that the Union Ministers should endeavourto raise  this regiment.   A reply, however, has  been  received  that while the utmostendeavours  will be made to meet the wishes of  the Army Council, the  recruiting forthe first regiment is proceeding very slowly and  the attempt  to recruit   anotherregiment would mean great loss of  time before it could be available.  It has therefore been  suggested to General Van Deventer to ask the War Office wdiether the troops: See Western and General Report for week ending 25th July 1917.2 See Western and General Report for week ending 27th June 1917.
could not be  supplied from some  other  source.  If this cannot be done the UnionMinisters will  use every effort to raise this regiment, but they think there would bea long delay before it reached East Africa.   The  Union Government have been informed that owing to the necessity of bringing the campaign  in East Africa to an  end, it will  be  necessary to comply with GeneralVan Deventer&apos;s urgent request for further artillery by transferring to East Africa theSouth African batteries recently despatched to Egypt.  The hope is expressed thatthe Union Ministers will concur in this arrangement.   The  Union Goverement are taking steps to obtain the  necessary reinforcements for the Cape Coloured Labour Battalion.  It is hoped that within the next few weeksa full complement  of 250 labourers will be embarked.                                GOLD COAST.   The Ashanti  Chiefs  have paid  another  1,5001. for  the  purchase of  a thirdaeroplane.                                  LIBERIA.   The Liberian Government have prepared a convention to enable all the germans in Liberia to be removed.   His Majesty&apos;s Government cannot, however, authorise theBritish Consul to sign this  convention  without  their having considered  the text.They  point out  that  the Liberian Government  should be  able to act upon the assurances  that  have  been given them  provided  that  the French and american representatives give similar assurances.                        PORTUGUESE  EAST  AFRICA.   It is reported from Southern Rhodesia that Makombie, the  principal rebel leaderin the Barue district, has  entered  Rhodesian territory near Inyanga and  desires to surrender.   The  Chief  Native Commissioner is proceeding  to  the  place mentionedwith the intention of disarming the whole party and bringing Makombie to Salisbury.                             BRITISH  HONDURAS.   The Governor has  enquired into  the  question of the supply  of  mahogany foraeroplane construction1 and has telegraphed to the effect that it will not be possible to guarantee a greater amount than  10,000,000 feet of the 1918 cut, but  if the weather conditions permit there  is a prospect of increasing this amount  by 2,000,000  feet.The  Governor  however points out the possibility of -obtaining other  woods in  theColony.1  See Western and General Report for week eliding 11th July 1917.
PART  II.-FOREIGN AFFAIRS.                          ALLIED COMMON AFFAIRS.    At the Naval and Military Conference of the Allies  which  took place in Parisduring the  week,  it was agreed that as the shipping question  was a  determining factor in the present  situation, a meeting &quot;of shipping representatives of  the allies should take place in London on 10th August, in order to consider the vessels which willhe available during the  next twelve months for the transport  of  troops  and other allied necessities, and to discuss the matter generally.  It was agreed that it wouldbe essential that representatives from  the United States  should be present  at this conference, and Sir  C. Spring  Rice has been asked  to approach the  United StatesGovernment in the matter.    The Rumanian  Government have  protested  against the  merely  consultativecapacity accorded to them at the Paris Conference, and allege that this arose from theopposition of HisMajesty&apos;s Government to extending the right of direct representationto Rumania.  The  Prime Minister states  that if the  same limitation is made atany future Conference, Rumania will refuse to attend.    It has been pointed out bySir G. Barclay that invitations were issued by the French  Government, and that  HisMajesty&apos;s Government were not cognisant until quite lately that the Serbian PrimeMinister had been asked to attend.   The  Rumanian Government  have been assured that their views  will be most cordially welcomed.    The French Government have now definitely replied that they cannot  agree to thetransfer to  Milan  of  the Head Purchasing Bureau under the Italian silk agreement(vide  reports Nos. 23  and 26), and  that  the Controlling Bureau should be at Lyons.This decision will, it is anticipated by Sir R. Rodd, add to the difficulties of settlement.The Italian Government, he reports, were inclining  to  the view that a  compromisemight be effected by establishing the Bureau at Milan, but permitting the control tobe exercised at Lyons.  Having regard to the French attitude, however, His Majesty&apos;sGovernment have notified  Sir R.  Rodd that  they cannot support the  proposal totransfer the Btireau  to  Milan.   The hope,  however, is expressed  that the  ItalianGovernment will now ratify the agreement as  concluded  in Paris, as there is muchconcern at the delay.                                   FRANCE.    The weekly report of the Intelligence Bureau for 26th July draws attention  to  anattempt which has been going on under the surface in French Socialist circles to forceM. Thomas to resign from a Cabinet which has already once prevented the Socialists fromcarrying out their declared  intention  (see  under &quot; Peace Discussions&quot;)  of going to stockholm and  may do so  again, and which has compelled  him to explain away his previous utterances in favour of a plebiscite in Alsace-Lorraine.  The same reportgives an  interesting  summary  of  M.  Clemenceau&apos;s recent  trouncing  of M. Malvy inthe Senate  for his leniency to pacifists,  and  of M. Caillaux&apos;s  tentative efforts tore-establish himself in the Chamber and with the public.    At an interview  on  the 25th July with the French Minister of Commerce,  theBritish Chamber of Commerce, while protesting against the delay in granting licences,requested that the import  restrictions might  be removed.   While indicating some measure of help, the Minister could not promise removal and stated that  all  licensingwas suspended  on account  of  the exchange situation.  As to the  position of HisMajesty&apos;s Government, Lord Bertie  has  been  informed that while certain  bulkycommodities must be excluded, other prohibited goods which are subject to a rationmay have the ration fixed  uniformly  at 50 per cent, based  on either 1913 or 1916,whichever is the  most favourable to France.  As  it  is believed this  would  allow
French manufacturers to export to the United Kingdom as much as they can produce,it would  be expected that the French Government would  in their  turn abolish, or atany  rate limit,  prohibition on  goods from the United  Kingdom.  Sir Austin Leehas reported that the position in France, is so serious  011 account of the lack of rawmaterial  and of cotton, wool, jute and oil,  that it is essential that an agreement shouldbe  come to  between  the French and British  Governments, or a crisis will result.It is hoped  to arrange for the French Minister  of Commerce to come to London,  toconfer with the War Cabinet and with the Departments on the matter  of restrictions,and also  in regard to shipping questions.                                     ITALY.    The  War  Cabinet having appointed a Committee, under Lord. milner&apos;s Chairman- ship, to consider matters relating  to the supply  of  coal to Italy, a meeting of this Committee was held  on the  25th July.   Sir R. Rodd has been informed that in  order to relieve the  situation at  the  moment, it was suggested  at  the  meeting  that the Italian vessels which have now arranged to load wheat in America might ship coal in place of the  wheat.   In this connection the Committee  expressed  the view  that the position regarding Italian wheat was satisfactory, and that  in  any case Italy  could obtain  supplies  from India, and thus  obviate the necessity of shipping American wheat.  The  Shipping Controller is, however, endeavouring to place some more  ships upon the Italian coal service.   In  September  next it  is expected  that  some vessels which are now engaged in transporting wheat to the United Kingdom can be liberated, but before that date  it does not seem probable that much help can  be  afforded.   It is pointed  out that the whole matter  could be arranged with greater facility if greater efforts  were made to protect shipping in the  Mediterranean.   The  Admiralty are investigating the last-named matter and maybe able to put forward some suggestions. In reply, Sir  R. Rodd reports the result of  an interview with  the Prime Minister and the Minister of Transports.  Enquiries will be made as to whether some of the vessels  now  loading wheat in America can  be diverted to  coal,  but the harvest prospects are bad and it  appears likely that in  the  coming year nearly 50 per cent. more  wheat will have to be imported than was the case  last year.  The supplies that can be  counted upon will  be  sufficient to last  till  January or February 1918, and American imports might he temporarily dispensed with if there were  a certainty of obtaining the necessary vessels later on.  Sir R. Rodd has suggested  to the  Minister of Transports that  some Italian passenger steamers in Genoa might be used by the&apos; United  States as troop  transports if in exchange the American Government would provide vessels for coal or grain transport.  In reply to the telegram from Sir C. Spring- Rice  as to the importation  of coal direct from the United States to Italy (vide Report No. 26), the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs has  telegraphed  that the Italian *coal question is now  being considered and that action should not  be  taken upon the telegram at present.   The objections to importing coal  direct from the United  States are entirely realised  and this plan could only be suggested as  a  method of dealing with an urgent difficulty.                                    GREECE.    At the Allied Conference  in Paris  it was agreed that the British, French, andItalian Governments will abandon military occupation in  Old Greece, Thessaly andEpirus.  At the same time it was decided that the  triangle of ground on the Epirusfrontier (vide Report 26) should  remain  under Italian  occupation  in the interest  of security, though Italy and Greece should agree to re-establish civilian administration under the  Greek Government.   It was further agreed that a naval and military base in the island of  Corfu should be  maintained during  the war by the United Kingdom,France  and Italy, though the  island itself should  remain under  Greek sovereignty.On being  informed of  the result  of the  conclusions  of-the  Paris  Conference  inrespect of the occupation of Epirus, M. Venizelos spoke in grateful acknowledgmentto Mr. Crackanthorrje of the attitude taken by  His Majesty&apos;s Government.        -i                               C
    With reference to the Allied controls in Greece, His Majesty&apos;s  Government haveintimated their willingness to agree to the absolute and immediate  abolition of thosecontrols which  affect Greek internal questions.  It is, however,  pointed out thatBritish Naval responsibilities in the JEgean must be safeguarded and, therefore,  theabolition of port control should be a matter for consideration  between M.  Venizelos,Mr. Crackanthorpe  and   the Vice-Admiral.   It  is pointed out that  the position of greece will make  it necessary for the  Greek Government to supervise  the  traffic between Greece and the  Islands, while His Majesty&apos;s Government must continue toexercise the passport control over travellers to England and. the British Dominions or those who wish to proceed to foreign countries through the British blockade lines.    The question of financial help to Greece was  considered  by the  Paris Conferenceand, subject to the  agreement of the  Treasury and the French Minister of Finance,it was decided that His  Majesty&apos;s Government and  the French Government  should arrange a  book credit  for the Greek  Government to an  amount not  exceeding200,000,000 drachmas.   This money will  be for the purpose of covering certain pastliabilities  such  as.  Budget deficits,  cost of  Salonika Government, &amp;c,  and alsonaval and military charges.  The expenses in the last-named category, which cannotbe discharged from the advance thus made, are to be considered by an Anglo-FrenchCommission sitting in Paris, and this Commission will also consider the best meansof meeting the necessities in connection with provisions and material, more  especially by the utilisation  of  American credits.  Payments  that  must  be made  in cashwill be provided by equal advances from  France  and the  United  Kingdom, and accounts in respect of such advances will  be kept and expenses borne equally betweenthe two Governments.  The allocation of the advances for the Greek. Army wdll be controlled  by a  Franco-British  Commission of two members sitting at the GreekMinistry of  War.    Particulars of the present condition of the Greek Army are given in a Report  bythe French  Inspector-General (Colonel  Bonnier), who has taken to Paris  detailsshowing the extent to which the available war material could supply and. maintain anarmy of 12  divisions.  It is recommended by Colonel Bonnier  that the  reservists of1905-1914  should be called  up in   Old Greece.   This would  make  possible  the mobilisation of five divisions of 15,500 men apiece, including 10,000 infantry. Thenew divisions, it is believed,  could be available by the end of  September.   The 1916and 1917 classes  of from 40,000 to 45,000 men  should  be trained  and equipped  byNovember, and these, together with, some reservists and  the three existing divisions of the  Provisional Army, would  total. 12 divisions, or nearly 200,000 men.   Anessential part of this scheme would be  the  provision of 4,500 horses.  It is believedthat the above represents the maximum which the Greek Government will be  able tocontribute, though it must  be added  that M. Venizelos takes a different  view andbelieves that  it  would be  possible  to  supply  10 divisions  in three  months and&quot;15  divisions  in six months.  Mr. Crackanthorpe does not consider the last  namedproposal practicable, and both he and Colonel Bonnier agree  in  believing that  the1916 and 1917 classes should be  trained at special  camps of  instruction instead  ofbeing distributed in various portions of the country, which is the plan adopted duringpeace and seems to be now favoured by the Greek Chief of the  Staff.    The suggestion that  a British  Naval  Mission  should proceed to Greece with  theobject of helping to place the Greek Fleet in a state  of  complete efficiency has beengratefully accepted by M. Venizelos.                              GERMAN  AFFAIRS.    The German Press is still busy with  its various interpretations of the recentspeech of Herr Michaelis  in the Reichstag.    The &quot; Vorwarts &quot; states that the speech  is capable  of the interpretation- that theChancellor favours a  peace  by  agreement  and. compromise in accordance  with theBeichstag Resolution.   It also says, however, that the speech is susceptible  of  theinterpretation that the Chancellor favours the  securing  of  German  frontiers  bypushing them forward, &quot; in which case Uerr Michaelis is no opponent to the forcibleextension of territory,  and is  iii the sharpest opposition to the Reichstag Resolution.&quot;    Herr Michaelis himself has thought it well&apos;to amplify his  previous  statement tothe Press.  He does not appear to  have dealt with the  various interpretations of his
speech given in Germany but he says : &quot; The enemy Press  endeavours to force uponil my inaugural  speech the interpretation  that  I only consented to the Majority&quot; Resolution with an ill-concealed reservation for Gerrnany&apos;s desires for  conquest.  I&quot; am obliged to  deny this imputation as to the  object of which  there can  be no&quot; doubt.&quot;  Herr  Michaelis points out that it was obvious that his declaration pre-supposed that the enemy should also renounce plans of conquest, and the fact showed that they did not remotely contemplate such renunciation, &quot;therefore,&quot;  he  added,&quot; they, not we, are responsible for the continuation of the War.&quot;    The &quot; Vorwarts &quot; of 29th July comments on this second statement of the chancellor to the  effect that he has expressed himself more clearly than in the Reichstag and now no doubt remains as to his adherence to  the Reichstag  Resolution.   The journalanticipates  that  certain German,  writers will say that  if the enemy does  not renouncethe  annexation policy Germany also  could not be called upon to do so.  &quot; This,&quot; itcontinues, &quot; is not borne out  by the Chancellor.  Germany is  irrevocably bound to&quot;the policy of no annexations and will fight on until the enemy gives up  the desire of&quot; conquest.   A complete restoration of Belgian independence is self understood.&quot;    Sir  W.  Townley reports  an article by the Berlin  correspondent of &quot; A.  Virlag,&quot;which states that before his speech in the Reichstag,  Dr. Michaelis is  said  to haveclearly notified the Party Leaders that  he could not agree  to the Resolution withoutreserve and to have forced them  to whittle it down until it became an empty formula.If this had not been done, it was feared that Herr Michaelis would refuse to support it.    The  Weekly Report  of  the Intelligence Bureau  for 26th  July draws  special attention to the effect upon the recent crisis of the peculiar composition and characterof the  Centre Party.  That party, though anxious to appear democratic, and a primemover  in the recent  parliamentary revolt which led up to the Majority Resolution inthe Reichstag, is  also very largely a Bavarian  Party, and strongly opposed  to anyfurther centralisation which would  diminish  Bavaria&apos;s independent status.   As  soonas  it realised that parliamentary  control in the  Reichstag would inevitably meancentralisation, it  hurriedly dropped its demand for democratisation.    Herr Erzberger has arrived in Switzerland and in  a Press interview states  that ifhe could have an  opportunity of talking with  Mr. Lloyd George or Mr. Balfour, an understanding as to the basis of peace could be  reached  in a few hours.  He  denied that the new Chancellor was  a war Chancellor, saying that he clearly comprehendedthat his mission was peace.                          ALLIED  ENEMY  AFFAIRS.   Count, Czernin,  in  a  statement  to  the  Press, declares  that he  is  unable tounderstand  why Herr  Michaelis&apos;s statements are accused of ambiguity.  He refers to the declaration of the  German Chancellor and the Reichstag Resolution as the&quot; expression of the German people&apos;s will regarding peace,&quot; and says that the german chancellor and the Reichstag are entirely agreed that Germany is waging a&apos; defensivewar  and seeks a  peace by agreement.  He continues : &quot; As  I am convinced, the&quot; Entente cannot crush us, and as we do not desire to crush the enemy, the war must&quot; sooner or later  end by  peace by agreement,  and the natural conclusion is that&quot; further sacrifices imposed on all  mankind are useless.&quot;  He adds, however, that peace must  be honourable, and that it will  only be concluded &quot;in  conjunction withour Allies.&quot;  As  to  the future, Count Czernin says : &quot; It is the duty of every moralthinking man to  find  a means to  prevent a repetition of the war,&quot; and  that the basic principles upon which peace by understanding may be concluded are, firstly, nooppressions,  and  secondly, prevention  and no  recurrence.   The Minister  admitted that in  Austria and Hungary the  Governments  were prepared  to  democratise theconstitution, but they rejected foreign intervention.   In an interview given by Herr Michaelis to the Berlin correspondent of the &quot; NeueFreie Presse,&quot;  the German Chancellor spoke emphatically upon the German Austro-Hungarian  alliance.  He  stated that  the cardinal feature  was close co-operationduring the  war until peace was achieved.   Further,  he remarked  that  the  close alliance would bear fruit after  the war in common works of peace.  In  order toexpress this personally to the Austrian Emperor, he was abandoning his  heavy workin Berlin and proceeding to Vienna.
   The Intelligence Bureau&apos;s Weekly Report on Austria-Hungary for 27th July statesthat  the German Austro-Hungarian Economic Conference being held, at Vienna, whilenominally engaged on devising counter-measures  to the decisions of last year&apos;s  Paris.Conference is more particularly occupied with the question of the Central Europeanwaterways (Rhine-Danube and Elbe-Danube canals).  In this connection  the  Reportdraws attention to the far-reaching demands of the Austrian  Navy League  (see under&quot; Peace Discussions &quot;).   It is reported from Holland that the oil production of Rumania is estimated at,500 tODs per clay, or one-third of the output  during peace. It is anticipated  thatthis  amount will be increased to over 2,000 tons within a short period.   It is  furtherreported that oil  transports to Germany and Austria are  proceeding regularly  andalso  that about 2,170 tons of petroleum are produced every clay in Galicia.j                                   HOLLAND.    Considerable  exports  of  scrap  iron  and steel  are being dispatched to Germany..For the year ending  3.1st May 1917 over 33,000 tons  have been sent  to Germany,while only 4,000 tons  have reached the United Kingdom.  The Dutch Government,acting under German pressure, is not in favour of sending any larger exports to theAllies,  and  as Holland receives great  quantities of these  metals from the  UnitedStates,  Sir C. Spring Rice has  been asked, to  call the attention of  the AmericanGovernment to the facts.    With further  reference to the capture of the German merchantmen (vide  Reports25  and 26), the  &quot; Kolnische Volkszeitung&quot;&quot; of 26th July says,  &quot;England&apos;s rule of&quot; terror in  Holland herself and round her coasts is becoming  unendurable.   It is&quot; almost beyond doubt now that England intends to make Holland a second Greece.&quot;Upon this, the &quot; Nieuwe  Courant&apos;&apos;  comments that the indignation  of  the  Colognejournal  is not the kind to make much impression.  &quot; It is one of the  defenders of thesubmarine war and thus has no right to complain of the  illegal action of others.&quot;    The same  paper,  however, under  the title &quot;Mad  Sea  Dogs&quot;  states  &quot;Six, or&quot; according to some reports, ten Dutch luggers have been  destroyed &quot; (by german submarines).    &quot; For  the  third  time in one  week, our  territorial waters have been&quot; violated by British warships.   The competition in injustice against neutrals continues&quot; between the warriors  for the freedom of the seas and those for the inviolability of&quot; the rights of  small nations.&quot;   The journal asks if the  British Government have gottheir Navjr in hand.                                   SWEDEN.   With reference to the importation of lubricants to Sweden, Sir E. Howard has nowbeen informed that if he indicated to the Swedish Government that  the importation of oils would be facilitated upon the settlement of the British requirements in relation tofishing regulations, His Majesty&apos;s Government will be  bound  by  any commitment which has been made.   At the same time it must be made clear that the action takenmust in no way be held to commit the  United States, which have placed an embargo on oils.                                    NORWAY.   The Minister for Foreign Affairs, in a conversation with Mr. Ovey, has stated  thatthe &quot;Norwegian Government intend very shortly  to  change their four-mile  rule inregard to territorial waters into one of three miles, for the duration of the war.                                  DENMARK.   With  reference to  the  importation of  fodder-stuffs  (vide  Report No.  26), the danish  Government have  issued  a memorandum further explaining their  position.
From - tliis&apos;ut appears that  owing&apos;to. the-anticipated bad harvest  and lack of. suppliesof hay and grass, it will, be impossible to maintain the livestock  in the country on thepresent scale  unless more fodder-stuffs can be  obtained.  Failing this  supply, the danish Government will be  obliged to permit the  exportation to Germany of  some50,000 horses  during the next two or  three months,  and about 850,000 cattle by theend.of&apos;.the present year, together with  considerable quantities  of butter and bacon.The Danish  Government suggest that if His Majesty&apos;s Government undertake, onbehalf of themselves and  their  Allies,  to place  no restrictions  on  the importation offodder-stuffs,  they  will endeavour  to  prevent  an export to Germany of more than5,000 cattle per week up  to 1st December, or of 3,000 horses jjer mouth to  the  sameperiod.  -  The  present  percentages  of  butter,  bacon  and  egg  exports would  bemaintained.   If this cannot  be done, but  fodder-stuffs  to the extent of  175,000 tonscould be imported into  Denmark before the end  of  the year, the Danish Government&apos;would endeavour to limit the exports of butter and bacon to Germany to 40 per  cent.,but could enter into no  agreement as to the horses and cattle.   Even in  the event ofno imports of&apos;fodder-stuffs being allowed, the Danish Government would  try to  limit their  exports to Germany  of butter, bacon and eggs to 50 per cent.   All the  foregoingwould be subject to the prices for Danish agricultural  produce  being arranged, with.due regard to prices obtainable in other neutral  countries.  Danish farmers, in  orderto meet tlie present demands from Germany, have decided to hold  back a proportionof the bacon and butter destined for  the United  Kingdom until, the negotiations are concluded.    The representatives  of the Danish Ministry and the Chamber, who are proceeding to Berlin.on 29th July,  are stated to be  going in order to improve the supplies of coal.Mr. Gurney, however, reports that  the G-ermans  are anxious  to improve the rate ofexchange of the mark,   and have  therefore requested the Danish  delegates to  bring-information as to the German products  which can find a market  in Denmark.                                    SPAIN.   The Catalan National Committee which met at Barcelona have  decided to conveneanother meeting to be  held towards  the end of  August.   The main stdrject fordiscussion at this meeting will be the conversion of Spain into a  Federation, underthe King, if he agrees, or, if he does not  agree, under a Republic.  The  convenersconsider that the  recent  meeting  passed  off successfully,  ami they  expect about&apos;300 deputies to attend the next meeting.   Mr. Smith, the British Consul, states that if a change is not made in the ministry or a General Election decided upon in the  first part of August, it  is intended to calla general strike.  Meantime  Sir  A.  Hardinge reports that  the  situation at Valenciahas. undergone improvement, and  the  greater part of the workmeu resumed their duties on 23rd July.  A  strike on the  tramways, however,  and part  of the railways,still continues.   A  strike  is also reported,  as having occurred at  Rio Tinto,  andSir A. Hardinge expresses the belief that  it has been  directly organised  by Germanofficials.   He has asked the Vice-Consul to endeavour to find proofs of this.   The French Ambassador at Madrid has suggested that the Allied representatives should combine in order to take action jointly if Signor Dato&apos;s Government is over-thrown and is succeeded by one  more  opposed to the Entente.  Baron Sonnino has expressed his disapproval of this suggestion which he thinks would be regarded bythe Spaniards as, an interference in their  internal affairs.  This view is supported, byHis Majesty&apos;s Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs who, however,  favours an entirelyfree, interchange of  views between the. Allied, representatives in Madrid.   It is reported from Corunna that a German submarine entered the port at 6.15 on30th July.   A demand was immediately made by the Allied  Consuls that  the vesselshoidd be  interned in  pursuance of the  recent  decree.   The  Captain-General ofFerrol gave  au undertaking that  the internment would be effected&apos;and the submarinehas since been taken by a Spanish destroyer to Ferrol where it will remain interned.BRAZIL.   The British  Admiralty  and  War Office  have  considered  the question of theassistance which Brazil can most usefully afford in the war.   They consider that  it        -1                            D
 would be better if  Brazil did not actually eater into a state of war with  the Central Powers.  A naval patrol in the South Atlantic would probably not be of much value, and Brazilian light  cruisers or destroyers would  again be  of  doubtful -utility in European waters on account of  the difficulty of obtaining British instructors Whririg the personnel up  to the  desired level ofj efficiency.   It  is thought  that Brazil&apos;can-assist most by affording harbour accommodation to British ships of war, arranging to charter ex-German Vessels  to  the  United Kingdom,  &amp;c.   The  War  Ollicevdo riot consider that it would be possible to maintain a Brazilian  Army in Europe.  &apos;&apos;&apos;  - - &apos; -    The Minister  for Foreign Affairs has  requested that all Brazilian ships; and hot merely ex-German vessels, should be permitted to utilise half space for coffee imports into tlie United Kingdom  (vide  Report  No. 2(5).                          ;&apos;                                    MEXICO.                               ..  . .   The United States have  permitted the  importation into Mexico of 2,700,000 cart-ridges which had  been ordered in the United States  before the  embargo  was placedon them.  These are to be used for local police purposes, and an assurance requiredthat they will not be used against Pelaez.                                   .r!   Carranza has asked the United  States for their  consent  to  his  raising a loan of$100,000,000 in order that  he may commence a new bank issue of  $150,000,000 tocover the deficit which has arisen from the  repair of railways.  Sir C. Spring. Riceunderstands  that the attitude of leniency  towards Carranza adopted by  the, UnitedStates Ambassador  in  Mexico has given rise to disappointment in American circles.They do not think that the supply of ammunition should have been  unconditional,and they believe that firmness is required in  order to  secure quiet.   It is reported from Tampico that strikes are  general, the leaders  defiant, and that500 soldiers have arrived.                               UNITED  STATES.   At the joint meeting  of the Italian, Russian and  British Ambassadors, at which m. Tardieu and Lord Northcliffe were also present (vide Report No. 26), a note drafted by M. Tardieu was approved by the meeting for presentation  to the Secretary of. theTreasury.  This agreed generally to the principle, of  the Inter-Allied Council, and asked that the United States  Government   should  proceed without delay., to the nomination of their  Commission and fix prices.  The draft agreement, as proposed byM Tardieu, provides for  the  formation of the European Inter-Allied Council, whose duty it would be  to state from time to time the war necessities of the  Allies andthe priority  in  which deliveries  should  be  made.  It would  also consider  thefinancial and  shipping necessities  and show to what extent the assistance of theUnited  States is necessary in  the provision of vessels over and  above, those inthe possession  of the Allies.   The  decisions  of  the  Council  would  be. carriedout  by  an  Executive Committee, representative  of  the  Allies,  at  Washington,which would  be the  means of  communication between  the   Council  and  theUnited  States Government.    On  the  other  hand,  the  United  States  under thisagreement would acquaint the other Allied countries as to the amounts wliichicouldbe placed to their credit.   Sir C. Spring Rice points out that for political reasons thePresident will not be  able to  appoint an official to represent the United States onthe European Council.  After consultation  with  Mr. Gordon, he suggests that the purchasing Commission  should be able to  fix the prices of raw materials  and be vested with appropriate power.  The Assistant Secretary to the Treasury has notifiedSir C. Spring  Rice  of the difficulty, under the  present arrangements, of..judgingbetween the military importance of Allied interests.   He gave as an example the factthat Russia had requested a credit of $700,0.00,000 up to January, and the Secretaryto the Treasury would like  to obtain  some  idea from the Allies  as  to the military importance of this.  As estimate for six months ahead  of the probable necessities ofthe Allies, arrived at in joint conference, w^ould help the United States Government indealing with Congress.
   In reference to Mr. McAdoo&apos;s suggestions, Lord Northcliffe has telegraphed  that ameeting was held at which Sir C  Spring Rice, Mr. Crawford, Mr. Gordon and himselfwere present.   It  was agreed that it was important that His Majesty&apos;s Governmentshould continue to exercise control over British shipping, and  that each of the allied countries  should  be  dealt  with  separately  through  the  Inter-Allied shipping committee.  It was further agreed that questions of food and.  munitions should  beConsidered separately, though the necessities might be ascertained  first, and  thenforwarded to the United States Government through the European Allied  Council. ButLord Northcliffe intimates that, in relation to finance, it is important that Mr. McAdooshould be informed first as to the advances that are necessary, both in  money andmaterial, so that when he has the facts before him, he may then endeavour to meet thesituation.   As a result of the discussion at the meeting, Lord Northcliffe has submitteddraft proposals which amend somewhat the draft proposed by M. Tardieu.  After pro-viding for the  establishment and duties of the Inter-Allied Council, Lord NorthclifiVsdraft states that it shall avail itself of the work of existing Inter-Allied organisations, andwhen the Council  has communicated the prospective requirements  of the allied countries, the  Allied representatives in Washington shall  discover the precise extentof the help which  the  United States Government can give to each Ally.   An important telegram on the exchange situation has been sent  to  Sir C. SpringRice by the Chancellor of the Exchequer for  communication  to Mr. McAdoo.   Thisrecalls the statement  previously made in a Memorandum  handed  to  Mr. Page  on20th July that unless  the  United States can meet the Allies&apos;  expenses  in America infull, including exchange, the whole financial fabric of the Alliance will  collapse (vide report No. 25). As the above Memorandum dealt primarily with the British effort insustaining the financial burden of  the war, the exchange question was not dealt within detail.   This, therefore, is considered in the present message, which, reviews  thegrowth of the  system  for supporting the  exchange, calls attention to the cost involved and points out the results of withdrawing it.   While at the beginning of the war  thetrade balance  favoured the United Kingdom as against America, and war purchaseswere therefore financed from America, the  balance  was reversed later  on, and  since may 1916 it  has  been progressively  adverse.   Towards  the end of  last year HisMajesty&apos;s Government was faced  with a serious  exchange situation, and the average weekly requirements  to  support the  exchange  amounted  in  December  1916  to$-14,600,000.   Since  then,  the calls  upon  the financial reserves of  the  UnitedKingdom in different parts of the world, anil other causes, have  raised the figures farabove  those of the year 11)16, and during the last few months the liquid reserves havebeen largely employed. If the last-named continue to be drawn upon at the present ratethey will  be totally exhausted in a few weeks.   The message proceeds to illustrate theBritish expenditure in the United States  since April  1916,  and estimates  that  theaverage cost of supporting the exchange, on the assumption that American  balances in London remain stationary, will not be less than $25,000,000 a week.  Having called attention to the central position which the support of the dollar exchange Occupies inthe financial system of the Alliance,  the  message asserts  that  if  the exchange were abandoned to-morrow, the collapse both, of the  allied exchanges on New York andalso their exchanges on all neutral countries would result.  For America  this  wouldmean the paralysis of a  large portion of her export trade, while for  the Alliance,  the diminution of their foreign purchases by at least -$25,000,000 a week.   In short,  the breakdown of the exchanges would  gravely  prejudice the capacity to carry on  theWar.  Apart  from this, the abandonment of the  support  of  the exchanges would beaccepted as evidence of serious distress, and would provide Germany with fresh hope to add to that which  is now placed upon the  submarine.  His Majesty&apos;s  government therefore ask  for an immediate reply from the Government of the United States as tothe extent of the support which they  may expect.  The  urgency of the matter is. shown by the fact that at any time the  demand for exchange  in New York may be so great that the British representatives  could  not support it without funds from theUnited States.  A position has consequently been  reached when a decision must be arrived at within  the next few clays.    In reply,  Sir  C.   Spring Rice states  that the  telegram  is  being  considered by Mr. McAcloo, who is about to  ask Congress  for further  credits.  At the presentmoment it would not be easy for  him  to  justify  payments to support  the Exchange. The Committees in charge of these matters  have  members upon them  who adopt a hostile attitude,  and it is questionable whether  any  Act of  Congress now  on the Statute Book would  permit of such  payments being  made.  Mr. McAdoo is desirous
of making clear the difficulties of his political  position for the next month, but afterthen he hopes to have money at his disposal and to be,able to help more satisfactorily.Meantime he wishes to know for  how long His Majesty&apos;s Government can continue tosupport the Exchange.   The President has had an interview  with  Messrs.  Royden and  Salter as to  theshipping situation.   In discussing the necessity of  America beginning a shipbuilding-programme on a greater scale than at present  contemplated, the President expressed his regret that the policy of  building wooden ships should not be continued.   These,he said, were meant for trading purposes in waters outside the war  zone and wouldhave released other vessels for the war zone.   As regards future building, there were difficulties in the way of obtaining labour and equipment.   While desirous of usingall possible means to meet the serious situation, he was,  apparently,  not yet preparedto adopt those measures of interference with civilian consumption and trade that  arenecessary in&apos;the present circumstances.   He expressed his regret that more aggressivenaval measures wore not taken, and indicated that he was anxious  as to  whether  theAllies  would be able to continue over the winter.    Further discussion has been  taking place in the United States regarding the goods of German origin  now lying at  Rotterdam, (vide Report No. 25), and a Senator isstated  to have asked why Congress  should be  called upon to vote enormous sums tohelp the Allies while goods which  have  been paid  for by American citizens are keptat Rotterdam by His  Majesty&apos;s Government.   Sir  C.  Spring Rice thinks that thefailure to permit these goods to  be dispatched is not helping  negotiations in othermatters, and he believes that the President will press  for an  early settlement of thematter.&quot;   In reply, His Majesty&apos;s  Government, while  expressing their  intention of meeting the desires of the United. States, state  that they only asked to  be supplied with full  details in order to enable them  to  exclude fraudulent cases, and  also toenable them to understand exactly what  is meant by the undertaking they were askedto give that all American goods lying at  Rotterdam, which have been paid for, shmudbe permitted to be shipped.   The hope is expressed that the United States will afford thenecessary information so that the matter may be settled.  A  suggestion of the United.States  Ambassador in London, that the question of delivery and payment for the goods should  be dealt with under the American  Trading  with the  Enemy Act, cannot beconsidered until further information concerning the Act  is  supplied by Sir 0. SpringRice;  but His Majesty&apos;s Government point out  that  the  differences  arising over  thissubject must not be allowed to continue, and they wish to meet the United States inevery way possible.    All vessels  built   or building for Foreign  Powers,  with  the  exception ofthose which possess certificates  of registry,  are to be requisitioned by  the  FederalShipping Board.  The Cunard Company point out that it is of great  importance  thatall efforts should be made to keep vessels  under the British flag, and the BritishCoilsul in New York is issuing provisionally some 170 certificates  of British  registryin respect of vessels built or building or contracted for  by the Cunard Company-.&apos;    While Chairman of the Shipping Board, Mr. Denman  had a scheme for  bringing about  the control of neutral shipping  by the  United  States  at freight  rates whichapproximated only one-half of those now prevailing.  It appears that the scheme  wasnot considered in conjunction with the representatives  of the Allies, and  its  existencewas only  brought to  notice when the  shipping  agreement between His Majesty&apos;sGovernment and Norway and  Denmark was  made known to the  Shipping Board.The new President of the Board, who has taken Mr. Denman&apos;s place, is not in  favourof the former policy, but  desires to co-operate  to  the  utmost with  the  Allies in all matters relating to the  best tttilisation of shipping.    Sir C. Spring Rice reports that thonghthe United States is gradually realising thatthe country is at war, the general feeling is clearly against an annexation  policy,  withthe exception, possibly, of Alsaced^orraine.   The President may be also said to adopt this attitude, and the British Ambassador believes  that he may seize  a chance  of pressing his &quot; peace without victory &quot; policy if public opinion were clearly in favour:of it.                  ^     l             .       ^           ;        .  .     .    &apos;    Articles in the American Irish Press (which maintains a close association with the German  propaganda) argue that Irish  independence  necessarily  means the end. ofBritish, sea-power, and  that the destruction, of the British Empire  is  a necessary  item in the Irish programme.   The purport  of the  articles is undoubtedly to show  thatGermany should make a sea base on the Irish  coast.  Sir  C. Spring Pice considersthat, as this would involve a danger to  the  United  States,  a number of people are
losing sympathy with the extreme Irish party, and that the Irish leaders will eventuallylose American support.   Having regard to this, he thinks  that  a  clear expression ofthe intention of His Majesty&apos;s Government to extend self-government to Ireland, and astatement that, in the interests of the United Kingdom,  the Allies  and the civilisedworld, the union of the Empire for defence must be maintained, would have a good effect on  American opinion.                                PEACE DISCUSSIONS.    The British Labour  Party, at a meeting on 25th July, selected Mr. Henderson,Mr. Ramsay Macdonald,  and Mr. Wardle as their representatives  to confer with theFrench  Socialists  regarding the Stockholm Conference.   These gentlemen  left forParis on  the 28th July, accompanied by  the four  Russian representatives who havebeen visiting London.    The  arrangements for the Stockholm  Conference  were considered  by  a  Sub-Committee at Paris consisting  of M. Renaudel and Mr. Henderson, M. Jean Longuetand Mr. Ramsay Macdonald, together  with the  Russian delegates.   In the declarationsubsequently issued it was proposed that the International Conference should be heldfrom  9th to  16th September,  at  Stockholm,  or, if  politicaL difficulties arose, atChristiania.   Before this, however,  an Inter-Allied Conference should  be  held inLondon on 28th and 29th August.  Meantime  His Majesty&apos;s Ambassadors  to France,Italy  and the United States were asked to inform their  respective Governments that,though  Mr. Henderson  had gone to  Paris  wdth the English  and  Russian Socialistdelegates, this fact did not in any way commit  His Majesty&apos;s Government to anythingAvhich these delegates or their  friends might decide, or, indeed, to  the  policy of theproposed Stockholm Conference.   Under the  impression that Mr. Henderson w-otildaccompany the Russian delegates to Rome,  Sir R. Rodd pointed out that the  Russiandelegates had been invited to  the Socialist Conference  at Florence  hy  the officialSocialists, who had opposed the Italian Government in every Division, and had carriedon an active propaganda against the war.  If they were accompanied by a member ofHis Majesty&apos;s Government, who would meet Ministers, Sir R. Rodd suggested that an awkward situation would arise.   Mr. Henderson, however, did  not  intend  to proceedto Rome, and he and the other British delegates have now returned to London from paris.    In the opinion of M. Sokolof the four Russian Socialist delegates are persons of noimportance.  Individually, he  stated, they were  insignificant, .and represented theSovyet of four to six weeks ago rather than  the Sovyet of to-day, which was a very different body.    It has been suggested by Mr.  Huysmans  that it would, be conducive to Britishinterests  at  the  Stockholm  Conference if  some  non-official persons,   thoroughlyacquainted with Indian, Egyptian  and Irish matters, could be sent to Stockholm tohelp the British delegates with facts  and references, in anticipation of attacks being-made upon British policy in regard to the countries mentioned.                ,    The  Intelligence  Bureau&apos;s  Weekly Report on Austria-Hungary for  27th Julydraws  attention  to  the new programme of the Austrian  Navy League.   this programme is based on two principles, firstly, that Italy must gain no  foothold onthe east of  the  Adriatic, and secondly that Russian influence  shall not cut the DualMonarchy off from  the mouths of the Danube  either economically,  politically,  orstrategically.   To secure the first aim Albania and  Montenegro  are  to  remaineffectively under Austrian protection, Mt.  Lovchen is  to be  annexed, and Antivari,Dulcigno, S.  Giovanni  and Durazzo kept under Austrian military control.   Thesouth-western frontier is to be advanced so as to give greater protection  to  Trieste.To secure the second the Serbian  bank of  the Danube, including Belgrade,  is to beannexed.  The Rumanian bank from  the Iron Gates to below Turnu- Severin is to be similarly dealt with.  Serbia and Rumania are  only to be  allowed to exist if they bindthemselves by lasting military, political and economic agreements to Austria-Hungary.The Danube Commission is to be limited to  the riparian States.    The  &quot; Kolnische Volkszeitung  &quot;  of  27th  July  argues that in response  to  thequestion  concerning  the return  of Belgium, which is  put to  Germany by England,Germany is entitled to ask whether England is  prepared to return Germany&apos;s  colonies.In the peace offer of 1916 it is  stated  that Germany showed the method which couldbe adopted  in  order to bring  about  peace,  namely,  the exchange of  views  at  aconference.
    The &quot; Lokalanzeiger &quot; of 27th July deals with the question put by Mr. Asquith as to whether  Germany  is prepared  not  only  to evacuate, but  also  re-build and compensate, Belgium.  The journal says :  &quot; Surely Mr. Asquith is not so simple as to &quot; imagine that apart from one or two cranks, any man of us ever dreams of returning &quot; Belgium  to England and France  to  be used as an Anglo-French jumping-off i! ground.&quot;    On the same subject the &quot; Deutsche Tageszeitung&quot; of 27th July says : &quot; Belgium &quot; must  come under  German domination because Germany will  know how to defend &quot; her.   Belgians cannot do  it themselves.  Also, if Belgium  remains independent, the &quot; French and English will  always be able  to attack  Germany through  Belgium and &quot; will have an admirable base for air attacks.&quot;    The &quot; vorwarts &quot; of 30th July in a review of Russia&apos;s attitude towards the Entente war aims urges that if Germany would only categorically disclaim  all annexations of territory belonging  to Russia&apos;s Western  Allies,  whatever the  result of the war, Russia&apos;s object in the Alliance would ipso  facto cease.  It  even professes to regard the recent Russian defeat as not altogether  a matter  of congratulation  in  so far as it weakens a patron of the cause of peace, which Germany has  so much at heart.   The article,  evidently written, for Russian consumption, goes on to deplore  the idea of Russia tumbling  from defeat to defeat into a chaotic abyss, and to  point out that while this  may  suit the  Allies who are perfectly indifferent &quot;to  Russia&apos;s future, Germany wants as  a future neighbour  a  strong, consolidated and freely-developing Russia.                                                       s    In his statement in answer to Herr Michaelis&apos;s interview with the Press, M. Ribot declared that it  was untrue that  on the eve of the Russian revolution  the French President  had secretly, without M.  Brianchs  knowledge, secured from the  Tsar a promise of support for the annexation of the German territories on the left bank of the Rhine.  What  M. Doumergue  had obtained,  with M.   Briand&apos;s  knowledge and. consent, was a promise of Russia&apos;s support for the restoration of Alsace-Lorraine and of her acquiescence in the establishment by  France of guarantees  against  fresh aggression.   Those guarantees  did not involve  annexation, but  contemplated  the possibilRy of the  German  territories west of the Rhine being set up as an autonomous state.  The rest of the statement repudiated in  explicit terms all idea of  a j^policy of conquest and annexation on the part of France, and a vindication of her claim to thexestitution of that which belonged to her.
