SECRET.APJMIECJIATTON  OF  THK  ATTACHED.  WESTERN  AND.&apos;.GENERAL                         !&apos;  REPORT,  No.,  4-2.                                IMPERIAL  AFFAIRS.   The telegrams sent to the Dominions drawing  their attention,  to  the  introduction.of. legislation  in  the Iiou.se of Commons  for the control of trade during the recon-str.uct.ion period are of great significance.  inter-Imperial organisation  and control ofthe resources of the Empire must precede  any inter-Allied organisation, and,  evenfailing the latter, would of  itself be a most effective  instrument of negotiation, at thePeace Conference and of defence against German economic aggression.                                 ALLIED AFFAIRS.   The events of the week  have been the creation of the Supreme Inter-Allied Counciland  Mr.  Lloyd  George&apos;s  Paris  speech.   The  scheme, as  at present  constituted,represents  both  the  minimnm   of what is  requisite  to bring  about  something approaching a common military policy and the maximum  of  what the Allied  nationsconcerned can accept as Compatible  with their full sovereignty  and  the responsibilityof their several general stalls,  ddie  demand, for  a single Cominanderdn-Ohief, voiced.so vigorously by the  critics in the  French Chamber, takes  no  account of practicaldifficulties.  It  would be dropped  in a  moment  if  it were  suggested  that  theCommander-in-Chief should  not be a Frenchman.                                      FRANCE.    M. Painl.eve&apos;s fall was inevitable before the Italian crisis.   For a  moment it looked as if the  interest created by  the Supreme Inter-Allied Council, would add. a few weeks more  to  the  life of his Administration, but  the  Chamber, thoroughly dissatisfied with its handling  of  the domestic situation, was evidently impatient to be done with it -andto move on to the new solution, whatever that solution may be.               &apos;                                      GREECE.    M.  Venizelos&apos; presence  in London, is a reminder that, for various reasons, thedelay in securing funds and  equipment, the reluctance of the population as a whole to fight, and the continuing strength of the Constantinist movement in a great part ofthe country, the  reorganization of the Greek Army is not making the desired progress.The Italian reverses will  strengthen the Constantinists in their conviction  that the Germans cannot De beaten,  and  will  please all.  Greeks  in  so  far as it is the Italianswho have been beaten.  M. Venizelos will  need all  the  support he can get,  and hasearned by his services to the Allies, in this difficult situation,
                                 ENEMY AFFAIRS.   The Italian success has eviden tally dissipated any hankerings  after independence of German control which the Emperor Charles may have  indulged in and  expressed to sympathetic courtiers  or gossiping professors.  He is making the best of thesituation, and,  in true Habsburg style, adding yet another crown, that of Poland, tohis many titles.  Meanwhile Ferdinand of Bulgaria and his  Chief of  Staff have  alsobeen, invited to the scene of victory to keep up their  spirits and  encourage them torather more activity than they have shown for some  time past,   ddie  victory will nodoubt have its  effect on the Turks as  well, and, for the moment, neutralise the advance on Palestine, whose full significance is probably hardly gauged on either side.                                 GERMAN AFFAIRS.   By getting rid of Dr. Helffeiich, and replacing him by a South German Progressive,Count von Fiertling has definitely given the new Imperial  Government a moderate and non-Prussian  complexion.   Put  moderation, as understood in Germany-, especiallyafter the Isonzo, is very remote from anything the Allies  can deal with, and does not bring us appreciably nearer the end of the war.                                      JAPAN.   ddie  question of Japanese military co-operation is being  raised again,  and theconclusion of  the Japanese-American agreement may7 make it less improbable than ithas seems dhith.er.to,.15th November 1917.L.

PART  I.-BRITISH  EMPIRE  AND   AFRICA.                             IMPERIAL  AFFAIRS.   The attention o  the Dominion Governments has  been called to the discussions atthe Imperial War Conference upon, the subject of legislation for the general control ofimports and exports for a period after the  war, at  which  resolutions  bearing on  theprevention of dumping from present enemy countries and  the control  of specificcommodities  were  passed.  It is pointed  out that  subsequent  developments haveconvinced the British  Government  thai, without legislation  on  the  lines proposedby1 them at the Conference, the interests of the Empire and the Allies in respect of essential requirements  cannot be  safeguarded, during  the period of  reconstruction.Under these circumstances it  is announced,  that  a Bill in  the terms set out  on pages 2G3-4- of the confidential  print of the Conference Proceedings has  been approved,and notice of presentation given  for 1.2th November.   The hope of the British Govern-ment is expressed that the Dominion Governments will co-operate by legislating  on similar lines.   The  Dominion  Governments  have   been,   informed  that  in  pursuance   ofResolution XIX. passed at tire  Imperial War Conference, the British government propose to introduce a 13111 into  Parliament to secure the  freedom of  the non-ferrousmetal  industry from German  control.  This will  be accomplished by requiring  allpersons engaged in the  United Kingdom in the  business of extracting, smelling,dressing, refining, or  dealing  by way of wholesale  trade with metal or metallic  ore(zinc, copper, tin, lead,  nickel and  aluminium, and  possibly other non-ferrons metalsami  ores  approved  by - the Board  of Trade) to obtain  an annual Board of  Tradelicence.  Businesses controlled or managed to a substantial extent by  enemy subjectswill not lie entitled to a licence except for special reasons.  The operation  of the Billis limited to the  period  of  the war and five years afterwards,   ddie hope is expressed that the Dominions may introduce similar legislation.                                    CANADA.   The Prime Minister (Sir  Robert Borden)  issued  his  election manifesto on  the12th  instant.   Referring to  the  commencement  of the war. Sir R. Borden uses thefollowing pregnant  words:  &apos;-&apos; Canada,  as became a  partner  nation  in  the BritishCommonwealth,  entered  the struggle  by the  decree of  her  -Parliament.&quot;   liecontinues: &quot;By voluntary enlistment an army of over 400,000 has been enrolled  .  .  .&quot; There was no thought of compulsion until compulsion became imperative.  There&quot; was no hesitation to  seek authority for  enrolment by selection -when the necessity&quot; for  greater  reinforcements was indubitably established.&quot;   In enforcing the MilitaryService Act, the Prime. Minister  states  that the Government will  proceed  upon  theprinciple that  the service  and sacrifice of  a family -which has  already sent men to the,front  will be taken into account when, considering the exemption of other members ofthe family.  Having dealt with  the necessity of  conscription,  Sir R. Borden outlineshis domestic policy and refers to the revision of the old system of taxation in  order-to meet the everdncr easing war expenditure and to ensure that all shall share  in  thecommon service and sacrifice. &quot; Wealth,&quot; he states, &quot; will be conscripted  133- adequatetaxation of war profits  and increased taxation of income.&quot;   Sir R. borden has  left Ottawa  for  Halifax where  lie  is standing as one  of  tireGovernment candidates.   Sir Wilfrid Laurier, in addressing the first meeting of his election campaign inQuebec, East, said that the prosecution of the war was the one great domi mating question.Referring to the &quot; first hours of  the war,&quot;  Sir Wilfrid said, &quot;If  Great Britain had.&quot; stood aside,  a general  sentiment of  regret  and blame  would, have been, current&quot; throughout  our country and.   especially throughout French  Canada.&quot;  On  theconscription issue, Sir Wilfrid declared  &quot;  our duty is  to continue, as we  began, with
the voluntary system&quot; and that  &quot;conscription has been brutally forced on the people.&quot;ddie Premier of  Quebec  (Sir Loiner  Gouin) at  the  same meeting  stated  that  ifconscription  was approved by the people of Canada at large, he  would accept and support it.    The  Leader-  of  the  French-Canadian  Nationalists (Mr;  Henri  Bourassa)  in announcing the support of the  Nationalist  Party for  Sir W. Laurier at the comingGeneral  Election, declares, &quot; We ask nothing better than to assist Sir Wilfrid Laurierin upsetting  the Government of national treason.&quot;    ddie Minister of Marine, Fisheries and  Naval Service (Mr. Ballantyne), in referring to  the voluntary recruiting  system,  stated last week   that when  commanding the245th. Grenadier Guards, eight  mouths&apos; efforts  and the  expenditure of large sums  ofmoney only enabled him to take 300 men overseas, the cost  of  each man  being -$90.&quot;Sir  W. Laurie r&apos;s manifesto,&quot; he  added, &quot;means no  more  reinforcements  for the &quot; courageous men at the front.&quot;    Idie  Minister of Inland Revenue (Mr. Sevigny) was prevented by a mob of aiiti-conscriptionists  from addressing the electors  of Dorchester County (Quebec) where he is standing as a Union candidate.   Many missiles  were thrown accompanied bythe cry  of &quot; Down with Conscription&quot;  and  several  of  Mr. Sevigny&apos;s  supporterswore roughly handled.   * The  Victory War Loan  of  $150,000,000 was launched on the 12th November.The interest is at 51 per cent.,  payable half yearly, and denominations as low as $50 are being issued.  The pa^-ment for bonds may be spread over a period, of five months in monthly instalments, and a full six mouths&apos; interest will be paid on bonds taken up in. this way.   Ponds are being issued for 5,  10 or 20 years  at par.    ddie   matter of  the  representation,  of  the  Dominion  at  Washington [vide Report No. 38) is standing over till after the General Election.    Regarding the position of  Canadians of military  age resident in  France (vide Report No. 40), the British Ambassador  in  Paris has been informed that  those who before proceeding to France  were ordinarily resident  in  Canada, and who are  not domiciled in France,  are  entitled,  by the Military Service Convention  with Allied States to certificates of non-liability to military service.    ddie   Dominion Government  have  made  certain representations  in regard  to arrangements  for enforcing the provisions of compulsory military service in relation to British  subjects  of Canadian birth or domicile  resident, in the United States, and United  States citizens resident in Canada.  The  Dominion  Ministers  observe that, though  there  is the utmost freedom of intercourse, residence,  domicile, &amp;c., between the two  countries,  the domestic laws  in regard to military service are essentially different,  and  it  is consequently  very difficult  to   make  reciprocal  provisions which  will  operate  with  justice.  It  is submitted that  the  Military   Service Convention  with  Allied  States  Act,   1917,  will,  not affect  the  power  of  the British  Government  to  conclude  a convention,  limited  in  application to  Canada and  the United  States,  such  convention  to  be  sanctioned for  the Dominion  by Parliament  or the. Governor-General.   The negotiations could, it is suggested, be most conveniently conducted at Washington through the  British Ambassador in consultation with the Canadian  authorities.   The proposals provide that citizens  of the  United States, resident  or being in Canada, and British subjects of Canadian birth or domicile, resident or being in the  United States, should be subject to the  law of  the country in. which they  reside, if, or in so far as they are called up for  service  in the country of their allegiance.  There would be a limited right of election whereby men might serve in. the military forces of the country of their  allegiance rather than in those of the country of their residence.     ddie  Imperial  Munitions  Board  have reported  that Norwegian owners  are negotiating for the future output of  shipbuilding  yards in  the  Dominion.  ddie British  Government have  therefore pointed  out  that on account  of  the  shipping position, their policy has been to prevent vessels  being  built for  neutrals during the  war.  As to  post-war policy, they contemplate arrangements which will prevent the completion  of contracts  for construction after the war unless  they contain a clause providing  that the  ship  is  not  to  be  laid  down  without  the approval  of  the Government.   Feeling certain that the  Dominion Government  wish, to co-operate, the Shipping Controller has laid stress on the importance of devoting the shipbuilding resources of the Empire  to the construction of vessels likely to remain  permanently under the  British  flag, especially  in  view of the  fact that the  United States have requisitioned  the  -whole  of the tonnage (about  800,000 tons)  contracted  for by the
                      AUSTRALIAN COMMON WEALTH.   ddie date of the Conscription. Referendum Poll has been fixed for  20th December.ddie  increased  gravity of the military situation  and  the  fact that the  voluntary system has proved inadequate to reinforce the Australian Army are officially given asthe  reasons  for  the Government seeking the  authority of  the people  to  raise  bycompulsory service  the  troops  necessary  to  maintain live  divisions  at effectivestrength.   idle Prime  Minister in his speech at  Bendigo on  12th November  outlined the referendum  policy  of the Government.   He  announced that voluntary enlistmentwould continue, but  in order  to keep up  the required supply oE reinforcements at70,000 per month, the Government would ask for  the authority of the people to  callup compulsorily  by  ballot the reinforcements which voluntary enlistment failed tosupply.  Under  the proposed scheme the ballot will  apply  to single  men between20 and  14, including  widowers  and  divorced  men  without  children dependent  on them.   Exemptions  will be given to the physically unfit, judges of Federal and StateCourts, police magistrates, ministers  of  religion,  and  those  employed  in industriesessential to the carrying on of the  war or whose  calling up would, for domestic reasons,occasion  undue  hardship  upon  their  dependants.    Exemption  from  combatantservice will, also be given to those  whose religious belief does not allow them, to beararms.  Dealing with cases where a family is or has been represented in the AustralianImperial  Force  by  the  father,  son or brother, Mr.  Hughes  stated  that an eligibleson  or  brother will  be exempt, and the eligible males  of families which now*are, or have been, represented at the front  will not be balloted for  until after the eligiblemales of families not so  represented have been called up.  In no case  will the  soleremaining eligible member  of  a  family which is,  or  has been, represented  at thefront be called up for service.  Males  under 20 will be exempted.  Ballots will betaken  by the States  on the  basis  of  the proportional number  of eligible persons ineach State.   Tribunals for  deciding exemption claims will consist of  magistratesspecially appointed and appeals will lie to a judge of the Supreme Court.   Mr. Hughesestimated that after making due allowance for the medically&quot; unfit and those of enemybirth and parentage, there would  be  150,000 eligible  men  between 20 ami 44, and45,000 between 18 ami 20.   ddie matter of the organisation of  the Australian  fighting formations (vide  ReportNo.  34), having now been considered  by the War Cabinet, a  telegram has been  sentto the Commonwealth  Government regretting  the unavoidable delay in  dealing withthe  subject.  It is pointed out that while the Australian divisions were engaged on the offensive front  in Flanders, it was  not possible to consider the best method of meetingthe  request that all the divisions  should  be grouped together in one command.   TheAustralian Prime Minister is,  however, now informed that it  has been arranged  thatlour divisions shall  be included in an Australian Corps and  the remaining division     -1-297-a                              EBritish Government for building in American yards  before  the entry of  the UnitedStates into  the war.   Though  the British Government have  not yet been able  tomake  full  use  of Dominion  shipping  yards,  mainly  for  financial  reasons,  theShipping Controller expresses the hope that Canadian slips may now be taken up  asthey  become  vacant,  if  previous  contracts do not  interfere.   ddie suggestion  istherefore made that Dominion Ministers  should  obtain powers to compel the buildersto obtain licences before commencing work on any new vessel.    AVith  reference to  the delivery  of vessels  building  in  Canadian yards  for  theUnited States  (vide Report No.  39), the Dominion Government point out that theyhave  power to requisition any ships  in course  of construction.   The Ministersrecognise that conditions have altered as  the  result  of  the  attitude of the UnitedStates regarding contracts entered into  by the  British Government in that country,but before they  withdraw  permission  to deliver  two ships  which they  agreed  to deliver for registry in the United States, they wish  to know  if  the  contracts for  theconstruction  of ships  which the  British Government  had in  the  United  Statescontained any stipulation  that  the. ships would be subject to requisition.   As  to  theapplication  for the transfer of a steamship built by the Thor  iron Works  to  theFrench,   flag,  the  French Constd-General in Canada has  been informed that  theapplication will not be entertained.
affiliated to that Corps acting temporarily as a Depot  Division until  reinforcementssufficient to bring it up to strength are available.   All five divisions will thus he Underthe command  of  General. Bird wood.  The  War Cabinet  express&apos;, the hope that  theCommonwealth Government will find it possible to send sufficient  reinforcements tomaintain the five divisions at full strength.   With regard to  the Staff question,  theArmy Council urge adherence to the principle (which was agreed, to by the Dominionsat the time of the formation of  the  Imperial General Staff) of interchange between british and  Australian officers.  Hitherto, it is  added, the main difficulty has been to obtain Australian officers for British Stalls, and. the Army Council  would welcomea largely increased  number of Australian, officers for this purpose.    With regard to  the suggestion that the 1914 decoration  for men who left england in. the original Expeditionary Force. should, be extended to men. forming the originalcontingents from. Australia (vide .Report l\!o.  39),  it  has  been pointed  out  to  theCommonwealth Government that this decoration is. issuable only to the men who servedunder Lord  French,  between 4th  August  and  22nd  November 1914, and. who, byhelping to stem the first tide of German invasion, saved. Europe from a catastrophe.The hope is, however, expressed that a clasp will, be given for Gallipoli.1    A Japanese firm, having applied for a  permit to trade with the Solomon Islands,the Commonwealth Government have been asked whether  they would entertain&apos;theapplication so far as the occupied  islands are concerned.   It  is pointed  out that, asregards the  German South Sea  Islands occupied  by  da pan.  the Japanese Governmenthave promised reciprocal treatment for British subjects so far as there is  no militaryimpediment.  It is  submitted by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs that  themilitary  impediment is  the only ground upon wdiich a refusal to grant a trading-licence should  be based, and it is remarked that a refusal based on this or any otherground  will, lead to retaliatory  action,  ddie Commonwealth  Ministers are  asked toconsider the relative advantages and disadvantages of the policy to be pursued.                                NEW ZEALAND.   The Government  of the Dominion having been urged, in.  Parliament to  take action.in regard to the control of the  large phosphate deposits in  the South Seas, the PrimeMinister (Mr. Massey) has stated that while in. London he impressed upon the ImperialAuthorities the importance to Australasia of Ocean Island and. Nauru  Islands, and hehad received a promise that nothing would  be done  in the way of disposing of them without consulting  the Dominions in the Pacific.   Shortly before the end  of the Parliamentary Session on 1st November, the PrimeMinister announced that the Cabinet  was  considering the advisability  of  taking  a referendum on the continuance of the liquor traffic,  or prohibition with compensation.The Liquor Restriction Bill was passed by  the Legislative Council with  amendmentsproviding that no liquor should  be served at meals  in  hotels outside  the  prescribedhours, and that the  licences of chartered, clubs might be revoked on mere suspicion.   With regard  to  the  rumour that  was widely current in  the Dominion  that  theMinister of  Defence (Sir James Allen)  was  to be appointed  High Commissioner in.London, Sir James  Allen has given an absolute denial to the report.   On account  of  strong  opposition in Parliament, the Social Hygiene Bill, which isintended to exercise  control over venereal disease, lias  been materially modified  andthe clauses providing for compulsory notification have been  eliminated.   The report  of the Committee of the House of  Representatives on the Meat ExportTrade has been presented and states that the Armour Company is  operating in NewZealand, but that there is no evidence that it has actually acquired any packing works.The Committee consider that it is most unsatisfactory and unfair that enormous profitsshould be made by the sale of New Zealand meal; which is released  for  the  civilpopulation in Great Britain.   The first ballot of married  men has been  held  in. the Dominion, when 5,000 of class A. were drawn for ensuing reinforcements.                                SOUTH AFRICA.    With regard to  financing the wool purchases, the Union Ministers have telegraphedthat they assume that the funds - which are to be placed at their disposal in London,                 1 The iSfew Zealand Ministers have been similarly informed.
as and when required after appraisement, will be  available on receipt of  telegraphic-advices as to the amounts appraised flora time to time.  The Ministers point out that owing to financing  war expenditure, &amp;c, it  will  not  be possible to finance the -woolpurchases without  obtaining  remittances from  London through the banks, and theyconsider that any exchange expenses incurred should be regarded as expenses of thescheme and refunded by the British Government.   An official announcement has been issued concerning the agreement with the BritishGovernment for the  purchase  of the Union, wool clip to the  effect that .167,870  baleshave been offered, representing about three-eighths of the total clip.   ddie Governor-General has  reported that the total number  of men. furnished in theform of contingents with their reinforcements as at 1st&apos;October 1917 amounted, to a totalof 1,(355 officers and 61,872 other ranks, including those sent overseas and to central and East-Africa.  It is stated, that no  troops were  sent  overseas during October asreinforcements for the 1st South African Infantry  Brigade owing to lack of shipping.It is added that the outlook  for  infantry recruiting  is very  bad (a draft of only 377men being now available) with very little prospect  of improvement.  Recruiting is,however, being maintained for other overseas units,  and  everything possible is being done  to provide reinforcements for East and Central Africa.   The  Transvaal   Provincial  Council has  agreed  by  IS  to .17  to  impose  aprovincial income tax.  The majority was composed of members of the South  AfricanParty and Nationalists, the  minority consisting of Unionists and supporters of theLabour Party.  By this  decision,  the  inhabitants of the Transvaal will for the first time  have to pay  both a Union and Provincial, income tax the latter being equivalentto 10 per cent, of the former.                       PORTUGUESE  EAST  AFRICA.   Further  representations are being made to the  Portuguese Government to theeffect that as every difficulty is  being put in the way of recruiting carriers by the localPortuguese  officials, the  British Government  think that the instructions reachingLorenzo  Marques  cannot be the same as those&apos;which  the  Portuguese Governmentstate they have sent, for it is difficult to believe that the local authorities would entirelydisregard the  categorical  instructions  of  the   Government.  The  surprise  anddisappointment of  die  British Government  are  expressed,  at the action, of  theirAlly in ignoring the constant representations that have been made.
part  II. FOREIGN AFFAIRS.                               ALLIED  AFFAIRS.    ddie first  meeting of the newly formed Supreme Council of the Allies took place onWednesday,  7th November at Rapallo, but it has been arranged that future meetingsare to be held at  Versailles.    On 12th November  General Wilson reported that General Porro was  to be theItalian Military   Adviser to the Supreme  Council  vice General cadorna.   ddiePrime Minister  at  once intimated to  Lord Bertie that as  the appointment wasdistasteful to the British and  French Governments every effort must be made to have it cancelled  immediately,  and  on Pith  November Sir R.  Rodd  telegraphed thatGeneral Cadorna had accepted the appointment, and that  Baron Sonnino was of theopinion that  General Porro had only been acting temporarily in order to assist the investigations of  the Allied. Generals.    French Press  criticism  of  the Supreme Council is chiefly on.  the ground  that the unification achieved  is  not  adequate, and that a &quot;Soviet of  Generals&quot; is not an effective substitute for a  single and presumably French Commander-in-Chief  of allthe Allied armies.  In this connection  Le  2&apos;emps  commends the action  of the AlliedGovernments in  forming the Supreme Council, as Mr. Lloyd George  has pointed outthat it was only a step along the road which they must go.    ddie Italian Government has  emphasized the importance from a political standpointof British troops being with,  the Italians in the front line when the enemy attacked the  Piave  positions, as this would  do  much  to fortify the moral of the Italianpeople.    Sir R.  Rodd   learns that Baron Sonnino  in  conversation  with the  american ambassador in Rome hinted  at the desirability of sending United States  troops toItaly, as  the presence of even a small  number  to show the flag would be of  great value in strengthening Italian, moral at the present moment.   Japan has decided  to  send the Japanese Ambassadors in  London and  Paris toattend the War.Conference in Paris, to which it now appears probable that  the MinorAllies will be invited,  ddie date of  meeting has again been postponed  until  19th or perhaps 22nd  November,  but Sir  R.  Rodd  indicates that Baron Sonnino  is of theopinion that the importance of  the  Conference  must necessarily be diminished,partly owing to  the formation  of  the Supreme  Council,  and  partly owing to thepresence of  the representatives of the Minor Allies.  He favours informal meetings ofthe Cabinet Ministers of  the  Major Allies which  can be arranged, with preliminaryannou ncements.   Sir C. des Graz reports the departure of  the Serbian Prime Minister from Corfuin response to the French invitation to attend the War Conference.   M.  Venizelos,  the Prime Minister of Greece, arrived in London on. 13th November.                                    FRANCE.   Lord  Bertie, telegraphing  in the afternoon  of 13th  November,  reported  thatM. Painieve&apos;s friends were rejoicing  over  Mr. Lloyd Georges speech as being likelyto prolong the life of the French Administration for some weeks, but in the eveningthe Ministry was defeated in the  Chamber by 277 votes to  .186.  In  an immediatelyprevious division the majority had fallen to 58, and  upon the rising of  the Chamberthe Prime Minister offered his  resignation of office  to  the President of the Republic.It will be remembered that M.  Painleve  last resigned on 22ud October and that  his predecessor, M. Ribot, resigned on 7th September.   Lord Bertie  states that  majority which turned  out  the  Ministry  contained  76Socialists, 33 Radical Socialists, and  12  Republican Socialists; but that M. Caillaux,as well as M. Briand,  voted  for  the Ministry.   There were  50 abstentions.  It is pointed out that this is the  first  time that the Chamber has refused a majority ofsome sort to a Ministry since August 1914.
                                   BELGIUM.   The Spanish Minister in Brussels reports that the  German authorities  have promised  to  withdraw the Language  Ordinance (vide  Report No.  40.  page 7) in flanders.   This justifies  the  retaliatory measures  taken by the British Governmentfor the express purpose of producing this result.                                    ITALY.   Mr.  Capel Cure  reports that public spirit in Milan  now  leaves  nothing to be desired.   A strong  deputation  is coming to Rome to insist on more vigorous  actionagainst espionage and disaffection.   Sir R. Rodd, on 11th November, reported that Sign or Giolitti.  had. conferred with the Prime Minister and Signor Boselli, and was expected to support the government at the opening of Parliament on 14thNovember after making an  appeal for  national unity.   The two chief spokesmen of the Socialist Party have  decided in favour of resistance to the enemy now that Italy has been invaded, and it appears&apos; that in  this case the leaders  have been themselves led by the  resolute  attitude of their  followersat Milan.   in estimating the individual capacities of Signor Orlan.do&apos;s Cabinet colleagues the intelligence Bureau  considers that  Signor Nitti, the Apulian  and Giolittist Ministerof the  dheasury, is a weak and. somewhat unwelcome spot, and points out that nothing-much is known about the Prime Minister himself except that he has a reputation,ability,  ambition and eloquence.   Sir R. Rodd learns that Baron Soimino lias remained at the Foreign Office only from  a sense of duty in  a time  of  national  danger,-and itis understood  that  the  proposed  clerical   attack  upon  him  for  having  spokendisrespectfully  of  the Papal Peace Note on.  25th October  will  in the circumstancesnot be delivered.     4297-3                            C    As  a result of  the collapse of the Painleve Administration, President Poincare on 14tli November consulted with  the  Presidents of the two Chambers,  and received  a number  of  former  Prime  Ministers,  MM.  bourgeois,  Barthou,  Donmer,  Peret, clemenceau, Viviani,  Briand  and   Ribot.  it is,  however, unusually  difficult on this occasion for  the political  prophets to predict  a successor -to  the fallen  Prime Minister.    The decision,  adopted by the Socialists in the  Chamber on 9th November, to abstain from any campaign in the lobbies which would,  be likely to favour the advent to power of a Ministry wdiich would  be a defiance to  the working classes and a danger to National Defence, is considered to have diminished the prospects of M.  Clemenceau as a successor to M. Painleve.   This impression was strengthened,  before the fall of the Cabinet, by the declaration made by the  Secretary of the Confederation Generale du Tray-ail that the formation of any Ministry likely to  be  a danger to the working- classes  would be resisted by them by force if necessary.   Against this action of the Extreme Socialists, which is considered to savour unduly of Russian methods, a section of the Press has warmly protested.    M.  Clemenceau himself accuses M.  Caillaux  of having  instigated  the charges against.  &amp; Action  Francaise  in hopes of diverting  the  public  to afresh scandal in which he wras himself not implicated, and calls for the trial of Tunnel and ail others accused of having intercourse with the enemy by court-martial.  This is criticised by.M. Ren a nd el who deplores excessive Press comment on the  scandals which tends to-submerge all France in the mud stirred up under the pretext of unearthing the guilty. Indeed  it is obvious that the Socialists as a whole appear, in spite of Senator BerengeFs report on Boloism in Allied countries, to prefer the  regime of scandals to the return of M. CJemenceau  to power.    On  10th November the Court of Cassation, dismissed M. Monier from the presidency of the Court of Appeal and deprived him of any right to  a pension for having, by his friendship for  Bolo,  served  as  a guarantee  for the latter and thus facilitated his schemes.  On  13th  November  Senator Humberts  parliamentary immunities  were suspended by the  Senate in order that he may be prosecuted by Bolo for embezzlement.
   The British Ambassador reports that on 10th November a satisfactory decision asto the  export  of lemons was  taken  by the Minister of Commerce,  and that theprohibition will shortly be enforced.  Meantime no lemons will leave the country.                                    SERBIA.   ddie Russian Government  is  supporting  the  Serbian request,  for  permission.temporarily to administer Podgradetz (vide Report  No. 41, page 8), but Sir R.  Rodd.reports that the Italian Government is opposed to this course on  the ground thatit  is a mistake to anticipate decisions  in controversial  issues which will have to be examined  at the end of the war.  . Sir C.  des Graz announces that the Prince Regent has postponed  the transfer ofthe remaining Serbian Ministries from Corfu to Salonika owing to the  uncertainty ofthe situation in Macedonia,   ddie Ministers  will therefore  return to Corfu after theirvisit to Salonika, where the Cabinet is to meet in the presence of the Prince Regent.                                   GREECE.   Proposals have been made in Athens lor a solemn commemoration of the events of1st December, and Lord Granville, who deprecates official participation, in any officialceremonies  on this occasion, lias  been instructed to discourage the suggestions  and invite his French colleague to adopt a similar attitude in the matter.  .1 le  also  pointsout that the graves of the British, victims of the outbreak are still, uncared for.   Lord  Granville  has  been informed that  the French will ask to take over  the PortControl,  from British officers within the French Naval  zone on loth November,  andthe Foreign Office has telegraphed that all British controls  in the French zone maybe handed over wdth the exception of those at the Piraeus  and Salamis,  the disposalof which is  reserved for further discussion between Great Britain and France.   ddie Greek Minister of.  Marine has been advised that the French Fleet will retire from the piraeus and Salamis one week after the  arrival of the British Naval Mission,leaving only one French officer in the Arsenal to supervise  the  completion of repairs to French ships.   Both the British and French Ministers in. Athens are unwilling to invite the  GreekGovernment to  set up a  Licensing Commission as they consider the Greeks are notyet capable  of organising by themselves such a body in. a way to merit full  confidence.It is suggested that a better procedure would be  to invite  their co-operation  in theexisting Allied controls over ports, passports, censorship, imports, and the Black List,and  thus gradually educate them.  ddie Foreign  Office is,  however,  anxious  thatGreece should co-operate with the general financial  blockade policy of the Allies,and. prescribes the procedure desirable to this end.   Lord. Granville reports that  martial &quot;law has  been extended  to  the Nomes ofTrikkala in  Thessaly and JEtolia as from 2nd November.   Lord Granvilie learns that the Italians have opened a civilian Italian post office at.Corfu.  Against this the Greek Government has protested as letters passing throughit escape the Greek Censorship and the smuggling of contraband is facilitated.&apos;  no attention having been  paid to these complaints the Minister for Foreign Affairs has informed Lord Granville that the Greek Minister in Rome has been directed to requirethis post office to be closed  by the Italians, failing which it will  be forcibly closed bythe Greeks.  Lord  Granville believes that Constantinist communications  have passed through this channel and is anxious that it should be stopped.   ddie French Government has  accepted the British  proposals wdth regard  to theenlargement of the Committee  of Inquiry into Greek  finance  (vide  Report No. 40,page  8), and suggests that a  small  conference should  be held on this subject inParis.                          ENEMY  ALLIED AFFAIRS.    According to the  German, wireless  the  Emperor Charles, the Emperor William,and Tsar Ferdinand,  met on 1.1th November near Trieste,  ddie  Austrian Generalvon Arz and the Bulgarian General Jekoff, Chiefs of their respective General Staffs,were present.
    The question of the Polish settlement has become prominent, and Sir W. Townleylearns that  it will  be the chief  subject of discussion  at  the  meeting of the main committee  of the  Reichstag on  the  18th or  19th November,  and also  at  that ofthe Austro-Hungarian Delegations in Vienna  on 3rd December.   Jn view of this itwould appear that the statements recently made  in  the enemy Dress  as to  thesolution of the Polish, question were  premature, but, in spite of the contradiction ofthe Frankfurter Zeitiing  most indications  point to the final settlement being on thelines  already indicated the Crown of Poland  for  the Emperor Charles provided thatGalicia be re-united with Poland, and Lithuania and Courland for the bmperor William.Sir W, Townley, however,  quotes the  German Press to the  effect  that perhaps  noactual annexations may take place as Germany-prefers to  keep all her  continentalgains as bargaining  pawns  to  be used at the Peace Conference for obtaining such.extra-European  commercial&apos;  and  economic  advantages from  Great Britain as willenable her to resume  her trading activities after the Avar, without which ihe&apos; economicvictory will lie with Great Britain in  spite of German military achievements.    In conversation with Sir E. Howard,  Prince  Lubecki, leader of the Central Parryin Poland, considered that  such  a settlement was likely,  and pointed out that Jusparty was determined that Poland should be a Monarchy.    In  connection  wdth  the  suggested  settlement  the Preussisclte Zeitung publishesproposals for  a  general,  exchange of  Poles and  Germans between  Germany and.Poland, and also for tire return  of German colonists from  the Ukraine and. Russiaproper to fill the gaps in. Germany caused, by the war.    According to a Vienna telegram to the Kolnisclw. Volkszeitung dated  9th November,the Pmperor Charles  speaking about the Aostro-Gernian Alliance said, that :      The Central  Powers have been able to defeat all the efforts of the World  in arms       during 39 months of -war because  they are united.  Bismark said in 1SSS that       so long as Austria-Hungary and Germany held together they need  not worry.       This holds good to-day.   Even the British encircling scheme could not prevail       against them.  In  .1906 Ling Edward VII.  offered the  Emperor Fran/, Josef a       free hand in the Balkans if he would breakaway from Germany.   The Austrian       Emperor  returned,  such an indignant  answer that the King left  Austria as       quickly as possible.    The journal continues to  the effect  that  several times during the war French andBritish Statesmen have offered Austria  handsome compensations if she would makea separate  peace.   These efforts  are  acknowledged  to  have had considerable effectamong certain nationalities and  parties in  Austria-Hungary, and. it is to these thatEmperor Charles directed his &quot; decisive words.&quot;  The Emperor  said  that in certaincircles the victory against the Italians -was not properly  appreciated.  . This applies tothe Polish Radicals and to certain Magyars who since Herr von Kiihlmambs speech saythat the  defence of Alsace-Lorraine  lias nothing  to do with them.   The  EmperoFswords betoken a strong refutation of a peace policy of renunciation.  This policy hadcaught on in Austria-Hungary and under pretext of  combating the Pan-Germans  anattempt  was being made to undermine the  solidarity of the Alliance with Germany.klapsbtirg and Hohenzollern  are now more closely united, than  ever and the Venetianoffensive offers a good lesson as to what their peace policy should be.    The  Frankfurter  Zeitung  refers to a Conference, as  being  in  progress  on.0th  November,  between the principal  military and civil authorities,  including tireCivil Governor of Riga, and believes that a decision is being sought as to the best meansof exploiting the international  situation in the light of the recent successes against russia and Italy.  Count  Czernin,  who   -was then in. Berlin  for the  purpose of returning  Herr  von  Kiihlmaiihs official visit  and of  meeting  the Chancellor, was expected in some quarters to attend this Conference.    Sir R. Rodd has been informed  that the Germans,  intmediately upon the capture of Udine, proceeded to hoist the Turkish flag  upon the castle, and began to build  a Mosque.                              GERMAN  AFFAIRS.   The Deputy von Payer who has succeeded Dr. Helfferich as Vice-Chaneellor of theEmpire, is  a  lawyer who was for many  3-ears  Speaker of. the  Lower  House  inWurtemberg and  afterwards  President  of  the  Progressive Party in the Reichstag.
Professor - Fried berg, a  National  Liberal Deputy in. the  Prussian  Parliament, andformerly Professor of Political Science in the University of  Halle, has become Wee-President  of  the  Prussian.  Ministry of   State.   According  to the Yorwavls  of 7th November, these appointments are due to the exigence  of  the  Socialists who made their acceptance of Count  von Hertling as Chancellor conditional  upon  the dismissal of Herr Helfferich.   This subservience on the  part of the new Chancellor isbitterly attacked  by the Pan-tier mans who accuse  him  of having  committed &quot;themortal  sin  in politics which will  make  him.  immortal  in  his shame.&quot;   Anotheraccusation  is  that the  Chancellor  is  treacherously playing  England&apos;s game, and thereby vitiating the victories of the Army.    Sir Id. Rumbold, in  a despatch dated 3rd November, draws attention to the factthat Count von  Hertling, the new German  Chancellor,  is almost  blind,  and is, inconsequence, very dependent on  his  helpers.  An admirable speaker before a largeassembly, and capable of much subtlety and force in argument when he is talking toone  or  two persons, he is  rather helpless when  he has to lace a small and  hostilecompany.  Fie has none, of the  easy-going  Bavarian and Austrian characteristics, but was anti-Prussian  during&quot; the Sayerne  affair, and  maintains  that  Alsace-Lorraineshould be made into a  Federal State under a  Roman Catholic sovereign from someSouth German family.    Grand  Admiral  von  Tirpitz,  speaking as  President  of  the Fatherland  Party,asserted that  in a German Protectorate over Belgium was to  be  found the military security  and economic compensation which alone can save the German population from disaster at the end of the war.   The Admiral is, however, no longer willing toset a time limit to the submarine campaign  (vide Shipping Situation, page IS) whichwill, if  Germany stands fast politically,   compel Great Britain to  recognise  theprexionderant  position, of Germany in Belgium.   Der  Tag considers that German.military ^successes  will shortly enforce the  conclusion of  a  peace  involving  theabandonment of French ambitions in Alsace-Lorraine, and of the British &quot; continentalpolicy, and the recognition by Great Britain of German equality at sea.&quot;    Sir W. Townley draws attention to the  concerted efforts of the German Socialiststo make capital out of the Parliamentary negotiations which preceded the appointmentof Count von Hertling  as Chancellor.  They are trying to persuade the world at largethat in  the  flood tide of German victory a  political  evolution  is taking place inGermany without any pressure from  outside, which has  brought about the desired.reforms.  Hitherto the great difference between Germany and other European states was that, in Germany the Government  was independent of  the people, whereas  abroadthe Government of  the  day had to make way  for  another the instant it had ceased togive satisfaction to the electors, and no new Government could  take up office without their sanction and  approval.   But now exactly the same conditions  prevail on this head  in. Germany as  in  other  States.  The political upheaval which has  latelyconvulsed. Germany is  calculated to increase the respect of all countries for her  and take out of  the  hands  of her enemies the strongest  weapon which  they  possessedagainst her.  This being the case  the Socialists maintain that the internal conditionsof the Empire have now  been so modified as  to comply with the  requirements of president Wilson, who  declared that  peace could only be concluded.with Germanywhen the German people could associate on an  ecpud  footing with the self-governingpeoples of other countries in the preliminary deliberations.   ddie -Prussian Agrarian  Herr  von Oldenburg Januschau, writing in the  LolcalAnzeiger, considers that the  German  Government has  not paid  proper attention tothe vital necessity of  stimulating the production of food on the  ground that  thedistribution is of more importance,   lie attacks the methods of distribution, which,he considers, have led to the waste and loss  of no inconsiderable part of the available supplies.                             AUSTRIAN  AFFA1 RS.   Sir .11. Rumbold has  information  from  an American source that when the newsarrived in Vienna of  the Austro-German victories  against the Italians no  flags Avereshewn nor was there any sign of popular rejoicing.  Regret, on the  contrary, wasmanifested among all classes that further fruitless successes might defer the conclusionof peace.  The same informant considers that shortage of food in Vienna will make
the  prolongation  of  the Avar beyond January impossible  so  far  as  Austria isconcerned.  He reports  that  the Hungarian authorities, indignant at  the greedinessof the Germans in trying to reserve all Rumanian supplies found  in 1916 for Germanconsumption, have  now prohibited  the export of food  from Hungary into Austria onthe ground that some of  the food formerly so exported  was  allowed to pass throughinto Germany.   Sir  \V\ Townley learns that a largely  attended  meeting of Socialists in  &quot;Viennapassed a resolution calling for a peace without annexations  or indemnities,  and onewhich would  make Belgium,  Serbia,  Rumania,  Poland, Lithuania  and  Courlandpolitically, economically  and  militarily  independent of the Central Empires.   Theresolution also called upon the Central Empires to adopt proposals for  abitration and disarment, recognise the existing Government in Russia, and  invite all belligerentsto arrange an immediate  armistice.                                NETHERLANDS.   Sir W. Townley reports that bombs  were dropped  on Dutch territory by Britishaeroplanes on 8th November, and suggests that in the circumstances an expression ofregret should be tendered to the Dutch Government as soon as possible.   The suspension of cable facilities is causing great inconvenience, and arrangements have  been made to ease the situation so far as telegrams between Dutch territory and allied countries  are  concerned.   ddie British  Government has intimated  that theremaining facilities will remain  suspended, until the question of gravel and  sand besettled.   The Eoreign  Office has published the result of  the  analysis of 39 specimens ofcaptured German concrete from  different parts of the Flanders front, which shows thatin 32  cases the gravel and stone  used was of German, origin.  This  goes far  to prove that the gravel in transit has been used for military purposes.   Sir C. Greene is uneasy  about possible Japanese  action against the  Dutch east indies which would ultimately cause trouble should  the  Netherlands  come  into the war on the side of Germany, and suggests  that  a  knowledge of this  may stiffen theattitude of  the Dutch Government.   The High. Commissioner of Egypt has been, informed by the Eoreign Office that the embargo upon exports to the Northern Neutrals applies also to  exports to the  Dutch.East Indies and other Dutch Colonial possessions.                                SWITZERLAND.   Iu spite of the expressed unwillingness of the Swiss Government to grant, separateloans to the Allies, the Franco-Swiss Loan appears to have been arranged satisfactorily,and the President of the Confederation received Sir 11. Rnmbohhs proposals for a loan to the  United Kingdom  favourably,  though,  he  considered  the amount  required(12,500,000 francs monthly) to be excessive.   The French Government is prepared,  to  agree to the  resumption of  the transitservice through Germany from the Netherlands for sugar, malt, and cocoa, as soon asthe German Government shall have replaced the  missing  goods (vide Report No.  33,page  12),  and  adequate  safeguards  provided  to prevent  the  recurrence of suchincidents.                                   NORWAY.   France and the United  States having agreed, to  the  transfer of negotiations AvithNorway to Christiania, Sir  M. Findlay has been instructed on the line to be followed.The Allies are anxious to secure an agreement providing for    (a) The complete cessation of all direct or indirect exports to enemy country ;   (6) The maintenance of existing exports and transit  facilities in  favour of the          Allies ;   (f,) The monthly supply of adequate and trustworthy statistics ;    4297  :*                               D
Li   (d)  Postponement until alter the conclusion ol peace oE  the repayment oE the loan          for fish purchases due in duly 1.918 ;   (a)  The landing of all Norwegian caught fish in Norway unless Allies consent to          another destination.   In return for this the Allies will give facilities  for the  supply  and importation of commodities on a rationed basis estimated to satisfy&quot; the legitimate home requirementsof Norway.   ddie necessity  for arriving at  a settlement is  pointed  out  as thenegotiations with Denmark are being postponed  pending that arrangement.   Sir M. Findlay reports that the  Norwegian Administration expects to fall shouldwar with Germany become necessary, but the Foreign Office has  warned the British.Minister that the eventuality is not unprovided, for from, a naval point of view, althoughshort of actually discouraging the Norwegians from resisting extravagant german demands,  there was no desire that: Norway should, enter the war.                                   SWEDEN.  - There is reason to hope that the questions at issue between Sweden and the allies will  be discussed and  possibly settled,  in.  London  as  a Swedish  Mission, of which mr. Lofgren, the Minister of Justice,  may  be  a member, has been invited,  to  takeadvantage of  the presence of the  American representatives  here  for  that purpose.Hitherto the American  negotiators have  been intractable and  have  insisted  upondemands  beyond  the power of any Swedish  Government to concede,  but now theBritish, French and  Italian Ministers in  Stockholm have advised their respective governments that if the principle that half a loaf  is better than no bread be  actedupon an arrangement is in sight.  They consider  that Sweden can be persuaded  to stop all food  exports  to Germany  and very greatly reduce the supply of  iron ore,  togrant free transit for Russia-bound  goods and.  a shipping Agreement by which theAllies would obtain a considerable quantity  of Swedish tonnage.  Insistence upon theextreme Allied demands would, however, alienate Swedish public opinion  and  lead  toa continuance of the present system.   Sir E. Howard reports that the Germans are very active at present in  their efforts to defeat the possibility of any settlement  with the Allies and also to discredit theexisting Administration.  Sir R. Paget, however, learns that when in Copenhagen theKing of Sweden  showed signs of  being less  enamoured of  the Germans than had previously been the case.   The British Government has intimated its willingness  to restore limited facilitiesfor telegraphic correspondence in cypher between the Swedish Minister -  for ForeignAffairs and the Swedish Legation in London, and for this  Mr. Hellner has  expressed his thanks.                                  DENMARK.   The King of Sweden visited the King of Denmark on 9th November.  Sir .R. Pagetwas informed that the visit Avas  due rather to  the constant  desire of His  SwedishMajesty to mark the solidarity of  the Scandinavian Kingdoms than  to  any partictilarpoint of policy.  In any case, the proposed meeting of the Scandinavian conference has been postponed until January.   Sir R. Paget reports that the imports of British  coal are less than was  hoped, and.that as  the  Government is exposed to increasing criticism, on  account of  the coalshortage,  it  is probable that negotiations with Germany will be renewed  with a  viewto obtaining increased supplies of German coal.   An agreement between Denmark and  Germany for  facilitating the passage  of danish ships to Finland with general cargo is reported.  Sir R. Paget considers  it  tobe unimportant, as no Danish  ships are  available,  and no general  cargo  can  beobtained without the consent of the Legation.   ddie Minister for  Foreign Affairs considers that Denmark is daily becoming moredependent upon Germany,  and as unemployment increases with the deterioration  ofthe economic situation, this is likely to  become  more marked.   It  is feared, that 50per cent, of  the workmen in the country will be  unemployed by  January,  and manyskilled hands are likely to  go into Germany, where every effort  is being  made  to attract them.
                                      SPAIN.    Sir A. Uardinge, in a despatch dated 30th October, reports that the message of the Military Juntas to the King of Spain which  indirectly brought about  the fall of the Dato Cabinet was presented  to  His Majesty on 27th October in the Casa de Caiupo near Madrid, and turned out  to  be not merely unobjectionable but actually effusive in  the  loyalty of its  contents which referred to technical  matters connected with the organisation of the army.  In a later despatch, dated 2nd  November, on the subject of the recent political crisis, the British Ambassador writes :     I hear in more quarters  than one that the decision taken by 11 is Majesty to change       tire  Dato Ministry was due to some extent to the  influence of  certain members       of his  Court,  not indeed  the Marquis of Tbrrecilla,  who is said, to  be very       cautious and correct  in all such matters,  nor the Marquis of Viana, who does       not meddle actively in politics, but the Count of  Maceda, a well-meaning  but       rather narrow-minded Germanophile, and the  Duke  of Santo Mauro, an able       and agreeable man, who belongs, I imagine,  politically speaking, to the party of       Sehor Maura.  If this is really the case, these gentlemen, have rendered a very       bad service to  their Sovereign and to the Spanish monarchy.    In reply to a telegram from the Foreign  Office, pointing out the  need of olive oil in this  country m order to prevent the  suspension of  the  woollen industry, Sir A.Hardinge reports that  a Spanish syndicate is prepared to export the required  amount(600 tons) in its own ships provided that permission be given for these to take 100,001.)tons of coal from Cardiff on  their  homeward voyage.    The  proposed joint  Allied  diplomatic  action  on the  subject of the treatment of enemy submarines by the Spanish. Government has not yet been taken owing  to  thenon. arrival, of the instructions  of three  of  the  six representatives.  The  british ambassador proposes  to discuss with his colleagues the possibility of pressing for the internment of the crews of enemy merchantmen as well.                                     JAPAN.   Following on. the announcement that  Japan,  and the United States had decided upon a common, policy with regard  to the independence and  territorial integrity ofChina  (vide  Report No. 41, page  14) comes the news communicated  by the british ambassador in Tokyo that a complete and satisfactory-understanding upon the matterof naval co-operation in the Pacific for  the  purpose  of attaining the common objectagainst Germany and her Allies has been reached,  between the two countries.   Sir C. Greene reports that  there are indications  in the Press and. elsewhere of a desire  to rouse Japanese public opinion from its apathy and indifference with regardto the  war.   Some  newspapers even discuss  the  possibility of appeals for Japanesemilitary  aid  from  the  Allies.   The Ambassador considers that this change is due partly  to the  warlike energy and enthusiasm  of the  United States and partly to  the fear of being discredited and isolated at the end of the war if the policy of observationfrom afar is too long pursued.                                     CHINA.   Sir J. Jordan reports that the  meeting between  the Acting Minister for ForeignAffairs and the Allied Representatives  in. Peking  took place on 6th November.  As aresult  action against enemy subjects was postponed for a month in order to enablefurther information from Allied and Chinese sources   to be  collected concerning theirexisting  commercial activities.   It is hoped that this  information  will enable  theChinese Government to realise  the necessity for taking more drastic action than is atpresent contemplated.   Sir J.  Jordan points  out  that the Chinese authorities haveneither the courage, nor tire funds, nor the  necessary  administrative machinery to effect  a  general  internment of  enemy subjects, and that it  is essential in Alliedinterests to get enemy  residents out of China  as  soon as possible.  The  british minister hopes that steps may be taken to facilitate their deportation and repatriationby appropriating Allied tonnage to the purpose, as the  supply of Neutral  tonnage isnow inadequate.
   At the request of the Chinese Government it has been agreed that General ChangHsiiu, the Imperialist leader, who has  been in sanctuary in the  Dutch Legation in peking since  12th July (vide  Report  No.  25,  page 14), should be extradited intoChinese territory and thence deported by the French for internment in Reunion,   ddieDutch Minister has acquiesced in this decision.   in view of  the  Japanese willingness  to  permit the immediate  advance to theChinese Treasury of 2,000,0001. on account of: the Currency Loan (vide Report No. 40,page 13.),  the Foreign Office no longer opposes the scheme in connection with this.   Sir J.  Jordan points out that the  Chinese Treasury  can. hardly be  described as&quot; hard, pressed,&quot; inasmuch as it  has an available  balance of about 1,000,0007,. and islikely to obtain more than twice that sum from salt  duties before the end of the year.ddie  British. Minister  considers that   the  financial  embarrassment of  the ChineseGovernment is  largely clue  to  the expenditure  of  65  per cent,  of the  revenue on.military objects, and he fears that if the  proposed 2,000,OOOL be advanced it&apos;will beappropriated to the same purpose.   In. view of this the Foreign Office has informed sir d. Jordan that owing to Japanese  insistence which almost amounted to a threat tobreak up  the  consortium Great Britain, decided  to  give way in order to preserve theBritish Group from exclusion from negotiations for the  new loan and to  maintain itsright to residuary participation.   ddie Russian  Minister having persisted in his attitude on the subject of inlandtariff revision (vide Report No. 39, page 13), the Chinese Government has invited thegood  offices of the other Allies  to  induce- him to abandon  a  position  which,  ifmaintained, can only suspend the revision of  the  tariff and thus impede negotiationsfor rendering effective the participation of China in the war.    ddie War Office has intimated that it is undesirable to accept the offer of a Chinesecombatant corps pending the completion of the programme  for the transport of cooliesami pioneers to be employed by the Allies in France.  The  question of making use ofsuch a corps is, however, being discussed with the French Government.                                 ARGENTINA.   Sir R. Tower learns  that the Argentine Government has  again  invited neutralSouth American States to send delegates to a Neutral Congress in Buenos Ayres.   After consultation, with his French colleague, Sir R. Tower has advised, the ForeignOffice that the German Naval Attache is unlikely to be able to do much harm in theway of hindering- shipping by reason of the small, number of available vessels  underthe Argentine dag (vide Report No. 41,  page 14).   .ln view of the reported offer of the Dutch. Minister to buy some 22,000,000 bushelsof Argentine  -wheat, it  is  interesting to  note  that  Mr. Barclay  telegraphs  from washington to the effect  that the State  Department is  not now disposed to proceedwith,  the proposed purchase of 85,000,000  bushels of Argentine  grain,   of  which40,000,000 are to  be wheat, on the ground that the  outlay necessary  for such an operation, is not justified by  the economic or  political, interests of the United  States(vide Report No. 39, page 14).  Mr. Hoover, the Food Controller, has, however, pointedout that  while the Allied.requirements amount to 40,000,000 bushels monthly,  thereare available for export in the United States and  Canada only 133,000,000 bushels,and that it is, in consequence, absolutely necessary to  purchase and load  Argentinegrain at  the earliest opportunity.    The attention of Sir R. Tower is drawn to&apos;the traffic  difficulties which are likelyto follow the inclusion of the German Electric  Power  Company of Buenos Ayres  inthe Statutory List, and suggests that the complete disorganization of -the tramwaytraffic which will be brought about will be  regarded  popularly  as  the  work  of theBritish Government.  The Foreign Office has been informed that this may, perhaps,be avoided by the expropriation of the German mains which could then be  connectedto the power houses of Allied Companies, and is anxious to know the Minister&apos;s viewson this subject.                                  URUGUAY.    The British Minister  reports that the  decree which had  been prepared on 10thOctober  was issued on 9th November.   In consequence of this  the German submarine and crew in Uruguay have now been interned.
   In  view of  the  undesirability of increasing  the  weight of German  influence  atSantiago the Foreign. Office instructed Mr. Mitchell  Lines to press  the Governmentof Uruguay to find  some pretext for preventing the  departure of the former GermanCharge d&apos;Affaires  for  Chile  (aide Report No. 4.1, page 1.8) until  he can  leave for europe.   This  course was not considered  possible by  the  Uruguayan Government,and Mr. Mitchell Lines pointed out that the German was a man of no influence.   Sir F. Strange learns that the Chilean Government considers that it  is  unable toprevent the return to Chile of the  former  German Charge dLVffaires in Montevideo,as he is  still nominally Secretary, to the German Legation  in Santiago, and that his case  is,  therefore,  different  from  that  of  Count  Luxburg who  was  successfullyexcluded from the Republic.                                    BRAZIL.   Sir A. Reel has been instructed to invite the Brazilian Government to consider anumber  of proposals connected with the  financial blockade  of  the  enemy, and  topoint out that the financial traffic, both direct  and indirect, between banks  in Braziland. neutral countries in Europe, especially Spain, has been large  and continuous andof great assistance to the enemy.                                     PERU.   Mr, Ronnie reports the departure southwards on 10th November of Dr. Perl, theformer German  Minister  to  1,&apos;eru and  Ecuador, under  British and  America:! safeconducts.   The attention of the Peruvian Government has been drawn to  the actionof the former Peruvian Minister  in, Berlin and a Peruvian Consul at Lucerne in directingan organization for German, propaganda  among  Russian  and Swiss Socialists in thelatter town.  Both  the officials  in question are German subjects although holdingappointments in the Diplomatic and Consular service of  Peru.   In reply,  Mr. Remainhas been informed that Herr  Van tier Heyde, the former  Peruvian  Minister in Berlin,who is still. Minister to Vienna,  has now been asked for by telegram ; he is at presentbelieved to be ili  in  Berlin where he has  no  official, status.  Herr Schwa bach  has alsoceased to have  an  official, status since  the rupture  of  diplomatic relations, and  isunderstood to have retired to Switzerland to avoid German military service ;  CaptainGuerrero, formerly  Military  Attache,  who is reported  to have  been  actually pro-German, has been recalled to Peru.                                 VENEZUELA.   The Governor  of  Trinidad reports  that  General  Castro,  formerly  President  ofVenezuela, was expelled from, the Colony on 6th November, and. sent back to New-York.                                   PANAMA.   Sir C. Mallet reports that the  National.  Assembly of the Republic of&apos; Panama liasunanimously approved of  all the measures taken by the Government in connectionwith the declaration  of war upon Germany.   A Bill has  been, introduced  to providefor the defence of the Canal,  and to empower  the  President  to  prohibit  trade withGermany and her allies.                                    MEXICO.    The  situation  in  Mexico remains  obscure.  Mr.  Cummins  has information thatGeneral  Carranza  intends to  proceed to  the  Tainpico area (vide Report No. 39,&quot;page 15), and that  on  his  departure  General  Pablo Gonzalez, a  pro-German4397-3
opportunist,, will be  left  in  charge.  This  officer is believed privately to  favourneutrality so long as money can be obtained, but he may at any moment be displacedby  an  outbreak of pro-German  anarchy.   Another   pro-German  officer, GeneralMurguia,  is sending troops  to  escort General Carranza  eastwards,  but Mr. Barclayreports  from  Washington  that  no immediate action  is looked  for  against GeneralPelacz,  although  Carranzists  under Manuel  Dieguez have  already been sent  toTanipico.   Meanwhile, uneasiness  exists as  to  the safety of the oil wells,  in  thevicinity of which fighting was reported to be in progress on 7th November, and it isthought that  the&apos;United States  may ultimately have to make an armed  intervention.At  present, however, the Military Authorities  appear to think that hostile action willbe limited to  sporadic  outrages  against foreign property in the  oil area on the partof local desperadoes,  not  necessarily organised or inspired by General  Carranza.Telegraphing  on .12th  November, the British Consul at  Tampico reports that  thepolitical situation in the oil-fields  lias become so  grave that in his opinion it justifiesthe application of pressure  for the  purpose of preserving the status quo in the Tampicodistrict.   ddie Governor of British  Honduras, telegraphing on  Otli November, had information to the effect that  (lie whole of Yucatan  and Southern  Mexico was then in.arms against General Carranza.  In these circumstances, the British Charge cVAIfairesdeprecates the sending of a British Minister to Mexico  without a supporting force, assuch action would expose the British Government to the charge of desiring to  bolsterup General Carranza against a new party, and do  away with any  prestige  whichnon-recognition of Carranza is likely to produce with the succeeding Government.   In view of  this  suggestion it is interesting to  note tdiat Sir C. Spring Rice was informed  by representatives of the highest authorities of the Roman Catholic Churchwho had   come to  discuss  Mexican affairs, that  the non-recognition, of GeneralCarranza  by the British Government would, if persisted in, produce a most favourableimpression among  the  members of their  Church,  both, in the  United States and  inMexico.   This, in their  opinion,  would go far  to  nullify the  intrigues which  theGermans are now understood to  be carrying on wdth the Mexican Church-                               UNITED  STATES.   Mr.  Barclay, telegraphing on 7th November, suggested that greater moderation inBritish Press references to Irish-Americans was desirable, as the more notorious subjects of these references  were unworthy of attention, and  fears have  been expressed infriendly  Irish  and Roman  Catholic  quarters  that  the anti-Catholic  and anti-Irishcampaign in certain  sections of the New York Press is due to British, influence.   Inconnection with this, it is  interesting to note that, in  a despatch, dated 19th October,Sir 0. Spring  Rice  points  out  that  public  opinion in the United States will nevertolerate political interference  by a religious  body or disloyalty on religious grounds.Pie is, therefore, anxious that this should  be made clear to the Vatican in order thatno steps should there be taken which might lead to a regrettable outburst of religiousfanaticism, embarrassing to all parties concerned.   ddie Ambassador, in the same despatch, with reference  to  the  financial  relationsbetween  the United Kingdom and the United States, writes :    The  question  of  exchange  is  a  complicated one, and  not  easily  understood.       ddiose who  understand it professionally are, as a rule, our enemies.  A clever       and insidious propaganda is  being carried on underground,  and it has already       had a great effect.   By far the most able man on the Federal Reserve Board is       Warburg, who was a German subject three years before his appointment,  and       whose  brother,  is now living  over the  German Legation  in Stockholm as the       principal propagandist agent  of  the (dennan  Government among  neutrals.     .  Mr. Warburg is elaborately friendly in his attitude towards us, and  does his       work  solely by  suggestion.   It is quite evident that his work lias  not been.       without its  effect,   lie  is  probably one  of many acting on similar  lines.       Mr. Schiff, of New York,  is supposed to  lie carrying on a similar policy, and to       be using his  knowledge of exchange to our  detriment.  An underground       peace propaganda in the  German sense  is  being conducted  by those persons       here who have large  financial  interests in Germany.  Some of  these  appear to       be in close connection with agents  of the Russian Government here, and their       activity is causing some anxiety.
SHIPPING  SITUATION.   According to  the  War Trade  Intelligence Report the total tonnage  of  500 tonsgross in the case of steamers and 100 tons gross in the case of  sailing  ships  reported lost owing to the malice of the I\ing&apos;s enemies during the period 2nd November 8th. November inclusive, is 39,800 tons, of which 20,094 tons were British as comparedwith 88,069 tons of which 58,882 were  British reported last week.  Sir W.  Townleylearns that the  Belgian  Consul-General in Amsterdam has been warned by german trade connections on no account to  insure any North Sea risks for the present.  this may  perhaps be  an  indication of a  proximate  intensification of  the  submarine campaign.   ddie Naval Appreciation points out  that during the week ending  3rd november the number  and  tonnage of  vessels, both British and Allied and neutral, lost owingto enemy action are the lowest on  record  since the  commencement of unrestrictedsubmarine warfare.  On two separate days during this week  no vessels were reported as having been sunk or molested by enemy submarines, these being  the first &quot; nil &quot;returns since the beginning of February.  During the week ending 4th November no british warship or merchant vessel of  any kind was reported  to have  been  sunk by mine.    ddie following  statement,  in the preparation of which the Ministry of Shippingco-operated with the Admiralty, shows the position of the British merchant shipping at the beginning  and end of October, after taking into  consideration the amount oftonnage laid up for repairs made necessary  owing to enemy action as well as  ordinarymarine risks : JonsTonsTonnage of British Mercantile Marine, including ships  under repair, on 30th September 1.917Cains during October:     New ships, built at home or abroad, and entered      for service under British Flag    Other ships coining under British Flag  -    Ships discharged ready for service after repairs      lasting 10 days and over142,336 78,606723,78315,604,20i 287,150   28,185   1.1,0701,620,345                 Total gains during OctoberLosses during October :     Ships sunk by enemy action    Ships lost by Marine risk          -        .  -    Ships otherwise lost to British Flag-    Ships  damaged  and  laid  up  for repairs  of 10       days or more, or awaiting repair                 d^otal losses during OctoberTotal tonnage of British Mercantile Marine available for service on  31st October 1917     -         -         -         -Add ships damaged before October, but still under, or  awaiting,  heavy repairs        -         -         -         -944,725 1,946,750 1,002,02514,662,182   896,562Total British  tonnage (500 tons and upwards) on 31st  October  1917      -       -       -                        Net loss during October5,558,744  105,463    Owing  to the  arrival  of  the American Mission  to  attend  the War Conference inParis, opportunities have occurred for the discussion of the whole problem of tonnage and  its employment.    The British Government has therefore invited  France andItaly to  send representatives to take part in  the  discussions on this subject whichhave already begun  in London.   In connection  with this,  Mr.  W. L. Ilichens,Chairman  of the  Committee  on Neutral  Thnnage after  the War,  has  written  to     4297-:!                              I&apos;&apos;
Lord Robert Cecil asking that the joint control of  neutral tonnage after the war  may also be discussed, as prompt action in that direction is very necessary, seeing that theGermans  are  already manoeuvring for  supremacy  in  this  field.   Sir  P. Howard,however, reports  that. Swedish shipowners are unlikely to. bind themselves for post-war chartering in favour of  either group of belligerents.    Following on  the decision of the United States  to allow Great Britain to negotiate on behalf of the Allies for  the disx^osal of the Chinese ex-enemy ships (vide ReportNo. 41, page 16), the British Government now proposes  that  the United States  aloneshould negotiate  for the  Brazilian ex-enemy  ships on the understanding that theirsubsequent  allocation  shall be  arranged  between  Washington, and the  western allies.    The  Danish  Government   is  much  exercised at  the  prospect of  increasing unemployment due  to a  shortage of shipbuilding materials, and has suggested that ships might be  supplied to the United Kingdom from Danish. jTards in return formaterial, or that Danish shipbuilders might be sent to be employed in Great Britain.This is the first reply to a proposal circulated, among the maritime European neutralsby  the  Foreign  Office for  the purpose of securing  a present or future control of neutral  tonnage  now  under construction  in  return  for a supply of the  necessary material to expedite or facilitate the building.    The Foreign Ollice has asked  for information from the British Legations in SouthAmerica as to the truth of the report sent from  Lima  that ait International company is to be formed for the utilisation of German, ships in South. American ports.                             PEACE  DISCUSSIONS.   The Ministers of Serbia,  Rumania, and Greece on  29th  October memorialisedMr.  Balfour  to  the  effect  that  their Governments  had  heard of  the  initiation  ofBulgarian pourparlers for a separate peace, and were most anxious  that Great britain should on  no account  listen to  these insidious suggestions.  If, moreover,  GreatBritain were to  be  made  aware of any  definite  Bulgarian peace  terms,  the  three governments hope that these will be communicated to  them, and a mutual agreementarrived at. as to the reply to be returned.  In  communicating this. fact, in a  despatch to Lord Grar.vil.lc,  the Foreign. Office informs him further that according to the three ministers, the -Allied  Balkan  kingdoms have arrived at a mutual understanding, andthat  while they are prepared to admit Bulgaria into the &quot; Balkan Block &quot; on reasonableterms, they do not think she will easily abandon, her  ambition to be the &quot;Prussia ofthe Balkans :&apos; with  a  hegemony wdiich would shortly become  a domination over herneighbours.   Sir R. Rodd learns that the. Vatican  is working to prevent any offer of a separate peace being made by the Central Umpires to Italy, as this would be regarded  by theItalians as dishonourable, and  at once rejected and would injure the  prestige of the pope, but there is evidence that  further proposals  for  a general peace will shortly bemade by the  Rope in understanding with the Central Empires.   In view of this it is interesting to note that Sir R. Paget learns  that at the recent conference  between  the  Chancellor, Marshal Hindenburg and General Ludendorfin Berlin it  was  decided  to  float a new Peace  scheme before Christmas,  and thata Deputy of the Centre Party  in the Reichstag has left for Switzerland to discuss thedetails with a representative of the Vatican.   The Bolsheviks on 8th November published a  manifesto in Stockholm demandingan  armistice  for the  purpose  of immediately  opening Peace  negotiations,  ddieBerliner Tageblalt, however,  had previously  expressed the opinion that it  would, bebetter for Russia to  threaten  to abandon the Allies unless they would consent to a&quot; democratic peace &quot; rather than actually  do so outright. -   The meeting of the International Peace Conference in Berne has been  adjourned until 18th November, and Sir II. Rumbold learns that it will  sit in two relays,  ddiefirst will comprise Neutral and Enemy Delegates,  the second Allied  Delegates and the neutrals from the first relay,   ddie Central  Umpires are giving every facility to theirown  subjects and to  neutrals who wish to attend.   Count Ivarolyb Professor Lammasch,and Mgr. Giesswein  are understood.to be  coming.  The British Minister  reports thatthe French-speaking Swiss who  are in  control  of the  Neutral-Allied relay of theConference are making great efforts to persuade the French  Government to issue
                                   GENERAL.   Sir R. Paget has been instructed  to  invite the Danish Government to impose astrict censorship on.  messages sent from the wireless  station  near Reykjavik  inlc.ehi.ii (I.   The Dutch Minister in Berlin reports that all British prisoners of war  have been withdrawn  from  Courland,  and,  to  the number of 1,680,  arrived,  in  Berlin  on 5th November on their way  to internment in Saxony.   ddie British  Government  has  received serious,  complaints as  to  the inhumantreatment of British prisoners of war near Dusseldorf, where they have been compelledto make munitions of -war, and are largely deprived of parcels,  and entirely forbidden to wear warm clothes, although they have to work 12 hours a day.   ddie  United  States  Government has  agreed to  refrain from engaging  in anyconference for the purpose of discussing the repatriation of unwounded prisoners ofwar, but  the  Serbian Government is unwilling to agree to  this.   It is  urged thatSerbian prisoners are in worse plight than the others  as there is no home country leftfrom which food or clothing may be sent to&apos; them, and so few now survive that theirexchange could not affect the course of military operations or  prolong the  war.  ddieSerbian Government is, however, anxious to consult the wishes of its Allies, and will agree to refuse exchange, provided that Serbian prisoners be raised to the  same levelof treatment as the others,  and are fed,  clothed, and watched over by Great  Britainand France.   A formal undertaking on the part of these two Powers to do  this wouldenable the Serbian  Government to face the Skupslitina with  equanimity on a subject which would otherwise provoke indignant opposition.
