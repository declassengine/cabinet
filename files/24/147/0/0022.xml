SECRET.APPRECIATION  OF  THE  ATTACH El)   WESTERN  AND  GENERAL                            REPORT,  No.   17.                                    . CANADA.   The striking success of the  Union  Government  at the polls affords  a clear indication of CanaoVs detenuination to put  her whole strength into  the war, and  it also involves a personal triumph for Sir R. Borden, of  which his followers may wellbe proud.  It is true that Sir W. Laurier has secured every seat but three in  Quebec,but an Opposition victory in that  Province closely, if not actually, approximating  tothis, was anticipated  by tbe  Unionists.   It  is  unfortunate  that the  two FrenchCanadian, representatives in Sir R. Uordehs Ministry should have been defeated, butit  is still possible  that  the votes of the  soldiers  may transform  these  defeats intovictories,   ddie  brilliant achievements of the Union  candidates in Ontario  and theWestern Provinces are full of promise for the future, for it is  in the West  that the increasing population will  exercise, more and more, a  predominant  influence  uponthe political destinies of the Dominion.                                 ALLIED AFFAIRS,   The question of coal supply to Italy has again reached, a very acute stage, and thematter is engaging the joint and  serious attention of  the Allied Governments.  Theeffect of the shortage upon the Italian poorer classes will, unless immediate steps are taken to relieve the situation, undoubtedly go far towards  assisting the &quot; neutralist&quot;elements  and  in  undermining  the  solidarity  between the  Parties  which was  soeffectively brought about  by the enemy successes on Italian soil.                                     FRANCE.   The decision to recall General  Sarrail  is a matter of  first-rate importance, and theaction of the French. Government in yielding in this way to British representations isno doubt to be traced to the determination of Monsieur  clemenceau. to place affairs salonika upon a more satisfactory  basis.
                             ENEMY ALLIED  AEEAIIJS.   There are several indications that Germany intends to indulge in a winter offensive against tire Western Allies.   In the terms of the armistice with Russia, Germany has agreed not to move any of her troops which were not under orders to be moved before a certain date.  This means nothing, as Germany was careful  to place practically allthe troops on the  Eastern front under orders before the agreed  date.20th December 1917.

PART   I.-BRITISH  EMPIRE   AND  AFRICA.                                    CANADA.    The election returns, so far as they are at present available, show a considerablemajority for the Union  Government.   Of the 229  elections  that  have been  already-announced,  supporters  of  Sir  R. Borden have secured  138  and the  followers  ofSir W, Laurier 9.1 seats.  All the Ministers have been elected  except  the two  French-Canadian Conservative Ministers,  Mr.  Sevigny  (Minister of Inland  Revenue) and colonel Blondin (Postmaster-General).   The  supporters of Sir W. Laurier have been successful in 62 out of  65 of the Quebec seats, but it is  to be remembered  that  the votes of  the  soldiers may&apos; alter the situation  in various  constituencies.   Indeed,such an  alteration  is more  likely  to occur in  the  Quebec constituencies thanelsewhere, as indications point to the  soldiers&apos; vote  being  in the main cast for  theUnion Government though the counting  of the votes  and  their allocation to  the constituencies  cannot  be  completed  for some  weeks.   The three  Quebec seatswhich present indications show to  be the total  which have fallen  to  the UnionGovernment in that Province are all for  divisions of Montreal, the Minister of Justice(Mr.  Doherty),  the  Minister of  Marine (Mr. Ballantyne)  and  Sir Herbert Amesbeing the  successful.  Conservative  candidates.   Sir  Robert  Borden  obtained,  amajority  of over  500  in bis constituency   of Kings (N.S.),  while  Sir  W. Laurier,who  stood for one of  the Ottawa seats as well  as for  Quebec  East, was defeatedfor  the   former, but was  returned  by a&apos; majority of 6,000 for  the latter.    In-Toronto, great majorities were  obtained by Union candidates, the Minister of Tradeand Commerce (Sir George Foster) securing  a majority of 13,000 for North Toronto,and the Minister  of  Overseas Forces  (Sir  Edward. Kemp)  obtaining a majority of8,000 for East Toronto.  Similarly large majorities were accorded the Government inWinnipeg and  the Western  Provinces generally.   In the four Western Provinces theGovernment have 54 out  of 56 seats,  while in  Ontario the Union supporters have proved,  victorious in 70 constituencies  out of 82.    ddie figures show  that the 100,000 men who are required to reinforce the Canadiandivisions can easily be  supplied from single men  in the  Dominion between  the  ages of 20 and 34.   ddie. number of such men reporting for service or claiming exemption.is 403,504.  Of these  only  about  half  have as yet  been medically examined,  and.already 171,473 have been  passed as fit for oversea service.   Married  men, therefore,who  are  included in Class  IT., will  not  be  called  up in  order  to  meet presentrequirements.    AVith  further reference to  the arrangements  for enforcing compulsory  militaryservice  in respect  of those born in Canada but  resident in the United States  andcitizens  of  the  United  States resident in Canada (vide Reports Nos. 42, 4-4 and  45),the Government of the United States have stated  that the proposal, to exclude from theConvention British subjects  &quot; ordinarily resident &quot; in Canada will cause difficulty dothe United  States in determining who  comes within that category.   An alternative method is put  forward, but on the  whole it is submitted  that the best  method wouldbe to abandon tbe feifort  to modify the Agreement in order to include or exclude Canada-and to depend on Article 3, which provides for exemptions, to exclude territories such asCanada and Ireland.  The British Government, however, have pointed out that men who receive certificates of exemption under Article 3 are not excluded from the Agreement,but are exempted from  military service, and that,  therefore, such men could not legallybe called up by virtue of some separate arrangement between Canada and the UnitedStates,   ddie British  Government, therefore, suggest that in order to enable the  CoTi-vention to be  signed at once, an Article should be inserted providing that in the eventof a special arrangement being made later between. Canada and the United States,  theConvention will not apply  to  British  subjects  in the  United States to Avhom  thespecial arrangement applies,  ddie views of the Dominion Government are  sought onthis suggestion.
   The Prime Minister (Sir  Robert Borden)  in.  his final  address  to the electorsannounced the policy of the Government regarding the  further, taxation of  incomes.He said that the  Government had  decided  that &quot; at the next Session we ! shall make&quot; our standard correspond, with that of the United States, so that those in this country&quot; who are enjoying large incomes may expect to contribute more largely to the public&quot; Treasury than they are doing under the legislation we passed last Session.&quot;                      AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH.   ddie Prime Minister  (Mr.  Hughes),  in  reply  to  allegations made by  the anti-con script! ouists, has announced that the Commonwealth Government will not introduceindustrial conscription.   Owing to the fact that the anti-conscriptionists are comparing the wheat prices paidto American and Canadian farmers with  the prices paid to Australian farmers, to the disadvantage of the Commonwealth Government, the Prime Minister  has  telegraphedto the British. Government for information on the subject.   A message from the Leader  of the Opposition (Mr. Tudor) has been  cabled, toEngland in which he states the position regarding conscription adopted by the officialLabour Party of the Commonwealth.   Mr.  Tudor says :  &quot; ddie principle underlying&quot; the question  to be decided at the Referendum  is the same negative as  last year.&quot; The  Australian Labour  Party, Federal and  State, is  opposed to the Government&quot; proposals.&quot;   from  reports received up  to the present regarding the casting of the soldiers&apos;vote in England and  France  in  the  Conscription Referendum, it appears that the voting on  each side will  be much  closer  than was  anticipated.   Various  causeswholly unconnected, with the merits of the proposal are influencing soldiers  in voting-&quot;No.&quot;   An interesting  test vote  conducted in  the Commonwealth  by the ReturnedSoldiers&apos; Association has shown  overwhelming majorities in  favour of conscription,thus illustrating that apart from the influences arising from  dissatisfaction  regardingconditions, &amp;c, at the front, the soldiers  would,  generally favour compulsory service in the Commonwealth.   The counting of  the  soldiers&apos; vote will commence at the  endof this  week.  Australian women in England are voting in the present  Referendumunder similar arrangements that, were  adopted in  the  previous Referendum, of 191.and  in the subsequent  General  Election of 1917;  but the  women voters  in  thiscountry are  confined to Australian Nurses or to those munition workers who are under  contract with the  Australian Government.   With regard to vessels leaving Australian ports in. ballast (vide Report No. 44)the Commonwealth Government have  suggested, that  in order to prevent wastage oftonnage, allied and neutral. Governments should  be informed that  customs clearancewill  not be granted to ships proposing to leave Australia in ballast.   ddie members of the Copper  Producers&apos; Association  (vide Report No.  43), whorepresent 90 per cent,  of the Australian  output, have undertaken  to sell all  copperthrough the medium of the Association for a period of 50 years,  ddie commonwealth government have  intimated that they intend to approach the British  Governmentwith a suggestion that the refined copper output of the Association should be purchasedfor a period of years.    The Prime  Minister  stated some days ago  that he hoped shortly to commence the shipbuilding programme of  the  Government.  He added, however, that  a defeat inthe  Referendum wotdd certainly  affect  this programme as he could not say what.would be the policy of any succeeding Government.   In  response to  the  enquiry  of the Commonwealth  Government relating to thesupply of gold for  South Africa  (vide Reports No. 41, No. 44 and  No. 45),  eoimnuni-cation has  been made with  the  Union. Government from which it appears that the-banks&apos; ratio of gold coin to note circulation  and South. African deposits is now  below10 per cent., and this ratio will continue to decline unless specie is imported.   Whileall efforts are being made to utilise notes in  preference  to gold coin, it has not beenfound practicable to prohibit the  use of gold as  the native population dislike  notes.Notwithstanding this, during the last three  years the circulation of notes has doubled.ddie British Government, while expressing gratitude for the gold which the Common-wealth  Government have promised  for military purposes,   hope that  the desired1,000,000 sovereigns to meet bank requirements may be  furnished from Australia.
   The Prime Minister has  announced  that  the  Commonwealth  will  make  asubstantial contribution towards the relief of Halifax.                               SOUTH  AFRICA.    The position on the Rand does not appear to be satisfactory.   Representatives ofthe mining industry point out that the threats of industrial disturbance have been metup to tlie present by the industry conceding nearly  all the demands made, but tbeposition has now arisen that a considerable number of the  low grade mines  cannot make any further concessions without - working at a loss, or at  all events without  anyprofit.   These mines, it is stated, will be obliged to shut down if there is any further increase of working costs.  It is also to bo noted that at the quarterly meeting of theJohannesburg Chamber of Mines attention was called to the serious shortage of nativelabour,  and it  was  announced  that it would  be  impossible  to  continue  operations on the 1915 and 1916 scale with the native labour now available.    Again, the decision of the Union Government that a reduction of 21  per cent, inthe quantity of glycerine for  the manufacture  of explosives for  the mines will takeplace at the beginning  of the  New Year is  considered  to render the maintenanceof operations  on. the present scale  impossible.   It  is pointed  out  that  since thecommencement  of  the war  the mines  have reduced their consumption from nearly500 tons to 350 tons monthly.                           GERMAN  EAST AFRICA.   With regard, to  the closing stages of the campaign, in East Africa, which, is no wtransferred, to Portuguese territory, General Nofthey reports that General von. Lettowhas moved up the Lugenda River and has captured  the Portuguese post of Nanguar,aboxit 75 miles south-west of Ngomano.  Inhere is at present  no enemy force withinGeneral Northey&apos;s reach.   ddie British Minister  at Lisbon states that the Belgian Commander in East Africahaving telegraphed that the British Commander  has been instructed by-the War Officeto release the  Belgian  force, the Belgian  Government have  issued  orders  for thewithdrawal of all Belgian troops.                                               1
PART  II. FOREIGN AFFAIRS.                               ALLIED AFFAIRS.   The War Office considers that direct interference would be difficult in cases whereRoyalist Greeks propose  to  proceed  to  Switzerland,  or Albanians  to  Albania.Intervention by British authorities would meet with objections from the Italians.   Sir C. Spring Rice suggests  that British subjects disabled  by reason of MilitaryService should be excepted from the cases  excluded by the Immigration Laws fromreadmission to the United States.   With regard to the situation  in Russia, Sir G. Spring Rice learns that the UnitedStates Government is disinclined  at present  to recognise Lenin, and.  estimates more-highly the Moscow attitude and  the prospects of Ealedin, Alexieff and Brusiloff.  Inthe view of the United States Government, opinion in  Russia taxes the United states with  commercial, and  Great Britain  with territorial, ambitions.   In dealing withRussia, the  United States Government, while proceeding on parallel lines, desires toact independently.   The United. States Government continues to permit the supply of everything exceptarms  and  ammunition to Russia, feeling  that cessation would  lead to  anti-Allypropaganda.   The French Government, proposes extending  to Tunis and Morocco the  Anglo-French Military Service Convention of 4th October.   Sir R. Rodd  reports  that the -coal  situation  in Italy has  become very criticaland may have a serious effect upon internal  conditions.  As it is understood that the-French supplies of  coal both at home and from overseas  are much greater this year than in 1916,  the Foreign  Office has instructed Lord  Bertie  to  press ^the FrenchGovernment to send 150,000 tons immediately.                                   FRANCE.   The recall,  of  General Sarrail from his post  as Commander-in-Chief at Salonika,.which he has  held for  over two years, is announced, and it is stated that GeneralG uillaumet has been appointed as his successor.   Lord Bertie reports that the French Government has not received am- invitation tothe Upsala Conference, but  that it endorses the attitude  of the British Government,and will, should an invitation be sent, endeavour  to dissuade  French citizens fromaccepting it.   In any case, the French Government will not  grant passports-for  sucha purpose.   A Press report states that the special committee of 11 members  appointed  by tbeChamber  of Deputies to examine the grounds for the prosecution of MM. Caillauxand Loustalot has decided by seven votes, with four abstentions,  that the Parliamentaryimmunity of the two deputies shall be  withdrawn.                                    ITALY.   According to reports from Sir R. Rodd.:    The Under Secretary for Foreign Affairs has denied in the Chamber the existenceof any secret agreement between Italy and her Allies that France arid England would support Italy in opposing any steps taken by Representatives of the Holy See towardsthe solution of war problems.
   Bitter attacks have been made against the Foreign Minister and General Cadorna.The former is  accused of provoking the invasion of Italy by the declaration of warupon  Germany, and  also  with having compromised Italy by  participation in theDeclaration of London.   It seems, however, that the  discontent is found not so muchamong the Pacifists  and Neutralists as among those who advocate more energeticmeasures.   ddie  other  Members of the  Ministry are  determined to  stand  or fall with theForeign Minister,   ddie Internationalist Group, which criticised him, has now decidedto support the Government, on. condition of an intensified prosecution  of  the war.The votes of  this group should enable  the Government to defeat the  Socialists andavowed Giolittians.                                   GREECE.   The Foreign Office has advised Lord Granville that the Greek Government shouldbe urged to take immediate steps towards the development of coal mines.   Lord Granville suggests the desirability of arranging a  clear understanding withthe Greek Government that for naval reasons, postal and telegraphic censorship to andfrom all islands must remain under British control so long as the Aegean is a british zone. .   The Foreign Office has  assented,  subject  to  agreed conditions,  to the taking over by the French Government of  the  Port Control at Piraeus  until  the  GreekGovernment is  reacty to assume the control.   The Foreign Office has instructed  Lord  Granville that no further  vessels oughtto be sent from the  United States to Greece, as this involves waste of tonnage and increases war risk.   His Majesty &quot;s Consul at Corfu has advised that a regular supplyof flour and foodstuffs should  be made to  the island  until the Greek government itself can manage the supplies.   The  capture of  Jerusalem has greatly impressed all classes in Greece, includingcentres which are reputed to  be  Royalist.   Lord Granville reports that the reception accorded to M. Venizelos in London hasevoked great enthusiasm in the  Press  and. in social gatherings, and is  a set-back  tothe adherents of the ex-King Constant!ue.                                  PORTUGAL,    A Press telegram of  12th December  gives the constitution of the new Cabinet asfollows :        Presidency, War, and Foreign Affairs -  Si DON JO PAES.

Of these the first three represent the Revolutionary Committee  and the rest Unionists and Centreists.    due Foreign  Office has instructed  Sir  L.  Carnegie to transact business with the Provisional Government of  Portugal,  due Spanish. Government  also recognizes the&apos; new Administration.    The Portuguese Minister for Foreign Affairs, in conversation with Sir L. Carnegie, insisted that the new Government  was  not &quot; Provisional,&quot; hut entitled automatically to  recognition.  He expressed  an  assurance  of  solidarity with Great Britain in regard to the. war.  He said the food cpiestion was affected by the drought, and hoped that  His Majesty&apos;s Government  would  give  back some of the ex-German  ships, as 60,000 tons at least was necessary for supplies.
                          ENEMY ALLIED  AFFAIRS.   Sir W.  Townley  reports  the publication  in extenso by  the Germans  of the&quot;Armistice agreement.   Besides the usual technical articles, it contains an undertakingnot to move troops from East to West,  except  those already on  the  way ;  a provisoallowing friendly intercourse between  the  troops  under certain conditions  and indefined, areas ;  provision for free shipping on the Black Sea and withdrawal of Turkishand Russian troops from Persia.  Finally the agreement  provides for the immediatebeginning of peace negotiations.  Baron von Kuhlmann will  leave for German Head-quarters in  the East to take part in these.    Sir G. Buchanan reports that the provision relating to trade by sea make it possiblefor grain, to be carried to Constantinople from  Novorossisk or copper from Reval  toDantzig.    The  Vienna  Correspondent  Bureau  wires that the  Governments of  Austria-Hungary, Germany, Bulgaria, and  Turkey  will now speedily open  negotiations for peace with Russia.    The Austrian historian Heinrich Friedjung, writing in the Vossisclie Zeitung, says that the  victor must consider the good of  the Serbian people, and not visit upon them the sins  of their rulers.  He proposes a Serbia closely  united to Austria-Hungary by economic ties and asserts that the national Karageorge Dynasty has  been responsiblefor all the  troubles  of Serbia, who would  be  more prosperous under the House ofHabsburg.  Further,  the incorporation  of Serbia  into Austria-Hungary is a military necessity.   Even if she  remain  autonomous, she must have no army.   As compensa-tion,  Austria would permit her to export her products northwards duty free.  It would,he argues, be a criminal  error to unite Serbia and Montenegro under a Montenegrindynasty  at Belgrade though Montenegro might be permitted  a qualified independencesimilar to that suggested for Serbia.    Dr.  Wekerle, the Austrian Premier, is  reported in  the  Rheinische  Westfalischeof 14th  December as  saying &quot;We have  carried on  economic  negotiations with&quot; Germany most seriously.  Even,  before I announced  my present official  position I&quot; did everything I possibly could as a  member of a private union to bring  about a&quot; rapprochement with Germany.&quot;    A Munich telegram of 13th December states that the Central Deputy Osel predictedthat the  Customs Agreement between Germany and Austria-Hungary would result inBavaria  paying the piper, and in the ruin of her industries and agriculture.    The Kolnisehe Zeitung of 13th December states that the Municipality of  Budapesthas unanimously passed a resolution inviting the Government  to arrange a complete&apos;jiolitical separation of Hungary from  Austria,  the person of the Emperor  Kingremaining the only bond  between  them for the future.   The  resolution states thatthis is the result of the conflict between Hungarians and Czechs, of which the austrian government has been content to remain a silent spectator.    Sir R. Paget learns  that  no business or private communications are  at presentallowed  to pass between Berlin and Constantinople by post or telegraph.                             GERMAN  AFFAIRS.   The Dusseldorfer General Anzeiger  of  14th December expresses fears. that theevacuation, of Livonia and Esthonia by the present Russian  Government will,  be accompanied by pillage and destruction.   In  the debate on Coal  Supply held in  the  House  of  Representatives  on  13thDecember, the serious deficiency was explained by various speakers as due to shortageof food and labour and the inadequacy of  transport arrangements,  ddie  Minister ofCommerce mentioned  that  three and a half million tons were  lying  at pit mouthsawaiting distribution.  He anticipated that Italian prisoner  labour would,  remedy thesituation,   ddie  Minister  for Coal Distribution  said that with care and economy the crisis would  be  passed in three or four weeks.   Deputy Hue, Social Democrat, saidthat miners&apos; wages  were insufficient.   Deputy  Vogelsand, Centre,  pointed  out that even if wages had been raised six to twelve marks during the war, money had fallen to one  third of its peace time buying value...  Idle Admiralty wireless press reports  that  the  Hamburg-Bremen-Africa; Line is increasing its capital  from 5&apos;5 to 10 million marks for renewing its activity aftertbe war.
:. r -  The. Ttforddeutschc  AUgemeinc Zeitung announces an early exchange  of civilianprisoners with Rumania, to take place across  the Rumanian front.    The Foreign Office has advised the British Ambassador at Washington that in viewof the possibility that Russian prisoners in Germany may be released; it would seem desirable (without public notification) to find means to prevent the sending of further supplies to them.    Sir W. Townley learns  that  during  the present year  Austria has imported intoHolland only 10  per cent,  of  her normal  trade in fur hats  and that  Germany hasimported only 3 percent, of her trade in woollen hats and 5 per cent, of her trade instraw hats.   Very small imports of these goods are expected next year..  r  Sir W Townley reports that Admiral von  Tirpitz, speaking at a Fatherlands Partymeeting at Hamburg, said the most burning question  was  Belgium;   England mightBe said to have won almost more than she  had lost in  this war.  Therefore a peacebased upon the status quo ante would be equivalent to a  defeat for Germany.    The  Hamburger Fremdeublalt of 13th. December publishes a  statement  of Dr.Mueller, Under  Secretary of  the War Feeding  Department, that  at the end  ofFebruary it would be made known if the potato ration  could be increased,  ddie fatsupply  must, however, be decreased.   From  information given by Major  Seidler,demand, generally  was  increasing,  whereas  no means could,  be found to increase production.   The all-round ration fixed  would be at the  highest 62T grammes, thoughinvalids and heavy labourers would receive  slightly more.   &quot;The  Journal adds thatthis will be a great blow to Hamburg, where  the average has been 90 grammes.    The Weser of 15th December observes  that the provision  of fats which nowadaysdepends entirely on milk is one.of the most difficult problems, owing to the conditions prevailing  as a  result  of the  bad condition of  the  summer pastures, unfavourablefodder harvest, and inevitable slaughter of  pigs and milch cows.                                  HOLLAND,   The Foreign. Office has advised Sir 0. Spring Rice of the desirability of the UnitedStates endorsing  the  attitude of Great  Britain and  France in regard  to the transitthrough  Holland  and the  exportation of sand, and  gravel  from  that  country to belgium.  .                               ,   Sir \V. dnwnley learns that there are now in Holland about,  30O Russian prisonerswho have escaped from Germany.  The Netherlands Government is prepared to maintainthese,  but  not to intern. them  as  suggested  by the British  and Russian Ministers.The  Russian Military Commission  at Rotterdam is  endeavouring to counteract anydangerous political activity&apos; among these men, but  there is a possibility that they maybe adversely influenced  by the numerous Germans  who  are  expected to arrive inRotterdam.                                   SWEDEN.&quot;l The Stockholm Press announces that a. certain Voroveky has been  appointed the authorised agent in Stockholm, of the -present  Russian  Government,  and that  hedaily issues visas in large numbers to  Swedes and other neutrals who desire to enterRu.s&apos;sia.&apos;  Sir E. Howard has asked, for instructions regarding the acceptance of  a visaof this character if such should be the only way of  getting a messenger to Petrograd.    Germany has been exporting to Norway and Sweden large quantities of machineryfor paper and cellulose.                                    DENMARK.   Sir R. Paget is instructed, to point out the  serious consequences which may result-to Danish  shipping concerns who may contract to  build solely  for trade betweenScandinavia and Germany.   A  Finnish delegate lias  requested  the Danish Government  to  recognise  theindependence  of  Finland.   ddie  Danish: Government has suggested the advisability of first obtaining  recognition from the Allies.   Sir..  1L  Paget  reports great activity by Germany in increasing her exports to scandinavia,  thus pushing  German  trade  and advertising  German vitality  at  the
expense of the Allies.  He observes that Danish business men appreciate the danger thatDenmark may become, economically  dependent upon Germany, and suggests. the advisability of sending to Copenhagen  a first-class man of business from Great britain to counter the German  propaganda, and probably  to  co-operate with an  Americanbusiness representative in the establishment of a joint bureau.                                     SPAIN.   Sir Arthur Hardinge learns that the highly organised propaganda of the Germans(who number 75,000) in  Spain is tending to intimidate Spanish Ministries, throughthe fear that it may create disorder  and paralyse trade  and industry.   Various of hisinformants  believe that  the Syndicalists  and  extreme  revolutionary  groups arebeing  financed, like the GarJists, from. Berlin.   Sir A. Hardinge, together with the ambassadors  of  Prance and tbe  United States have  requested  that the crews  ofGerman merchant vessels now in Spanish  ports should be interned.   Sir A. Hardinge learns that a general election is expected early in February.                                     JAPAN.    Under instructions  from the Ministry of Shipping, and with  the consent of theJapanese -Government, all ships now en  route  to Viadivostock  from the United Statescarrying  goods bought  in the  United States of America by means of British creditare to  unload in Japan.    Sir C. Greene has been instructed  to  urge the Japanese Government to suspendfor the present all shipments to Russia, whether of native or imported  goods.    Sir G  Greene reports  that the  Japanese  Foreign Office  characterises  as aninvention the  statement--alleged to have  been made by the  Japanese  Embassy  in washington that Japanese troops had landed  in force at Viadivostock.    His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Vice-Cons.nl at Viadivostock confirms that neither japanese troops nor engineers are at  Viadivostock, and  believes  that  the confusion  has arisenfrom the re-establishment there of 400 American instructors to assist  in  the workingof the  Siberian Railway.    According  to Sir C. Spring Rice, the United States Foreign Office has no iuforma-tiou of a Japianese landing, but this would not be objected to in view of the danger  ofthe town  and  war material falling into the hands of the Bolshevists.    The Japanese Government has expressed, its willingness to  discuss with the Alliesthe safeguarding of  the  line from Viadivostock to Harbin, or  as far us  the junctionwdth the Amur Railway,  ddie participation by American troops in  this project wouldbe viewed with disfavour in Japan.  .  The  United States  War Trade  Board inquires whether India will  be  able  tosupply Japan with cotton, in view of possible shortage in America.                                     CHINA,    Dr. Morrison, Political Adviser to the Chinese Government, states that China aimsat a voice in the ultimate Peace Conference.    Sir J. Jordan reports that the Bolshevists  have assumed control  at  Harbin, andthat the Consuls have been informed by General .1 lorvat that he  is no longer responsible.General llorvat is still nominal head of the railway administration, and issued orders on 12th December that goods were not to be  accepted for Russia without permission ofthe Maiichurian Purchasing Committee.                                          .    The Chinese local authorities decline to recognise the Bolshevists,  but will take no action against them.  An  adequate  force  of 3,500 Chinese troops is present toprotect foreigners.                                     . SIAM,    Negotiations in regard, to the chartering of German ships  seized  by the SiameseGovernment have now been completed.                                     CHIDE.    Sir F. Strongs states that the report  of  an arrangement to cede Easter Island to japan is ridiculed by the Chilean Under Secretary for Foreign  Affairs,
   He adds that the Government and country wish to remain  neutral, and that thereis  no probability of unfriendly action.  Any German  outrage against Chile would provoke a strong attitude.                                    BOLIVIA.   Mr. Haggard reports that the Bolivian  and Brazilian Governments will not  attend the Neutral Congress at Buenos Ayres without an assurance that all  the Governmentsattending will be bound by the decision of the majority.   It seems to Mr. Haggard desirable that, this attitude should be encouraged, as there appears to be a majority of nine in Congress  in favour of the severance of relationswith Germany.  .                                  ECUADOR.   Mr. Wilson  learns that the Government of Ecuador will  henceforward place no limit upon the&apos;period during which British warships may remain in Ecuadorian ports.                                    MEXICO.   Information  has reached Mr. Cummins and the French  Minister  that a  partyconsisting of Germans and  local authorities has been  investigating various parts  ofthe coast, probably with a view to  the  selection  of  suitable  places for wirelessinstallations or supply bases.   Mr.  Cummins also learns  that  the German Legation has been  selling drafts  inmarks on Berlin, to a large amount, at the  current  rate of exchange.   These draftsguarantee payment with interest at  6 per cent.   ddie United States Ambassador  in. Mexico left for Washington on 12th Decemberafter an interview with  Sehor Carranza.  It is  reported on reliable authority that  heis not satisfied with some of carranza&apos;s statements.   ddie Foreign  Office  advises Sir  C. Spring  Rice  that co-operation  between  GreatBritain, France,  and  the United States  would  be desirable in  dealing with.  Mexico,and suggests that support should he given both to General. Pelaez and to Felix Diaz.   Mr. Cummins understands that marked enmity  towards  Carranza  exists in  allclasses, and that a military coup d&apos;etat against him may take place at any moment.   The United States Charge d&apos;Affaires is informed  that Generals Coss and  Gutierezhave turned against Carranza.   Sir 0. Spring Rice learns that the United States Government is opposed to grantinga loan to Carranza in present circumstances.   He  deprecates action  being taken inthis direction by any foreign group without the knowledge and consent of  the UnitedStates Government.   The Foreign  Office  instructs Sir  0. Spring Rice to suggest to  the United,StatesGovernment the difficulties that may arise from withholding foodstuffs  from Mexico.                                     CUBA.   Mr. Leech reports on  18th December that Cuba has proclaimed the existence of astate of war with Austria-Hungary.                        UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.   An Executive Order issued by the President on  7th  December prohibits  foreigninsurance companies from doing business within the United States after 1st February1918 without licence from the Secretary of the dheasury.  Sir C. Spring Rice  antici-pates that British companies will have no difficulty in obtaining licences.
 j: &apos; Sir C. Spring ]lice reports that a Bill will he prepared making it a misdemeanour for any unauthorised person to wear the uniform  or  regalia of an3&apos; foreign, country. Similar legislation is suggested for Great Britain and France.    Sir G. Spring Rice learns that, the United States Government is sending an officer for liaison work with the British Postal Censorship.    Mr. Bayley reports  that  Mr. dohn. Henry Hammond,  Director  of  the Enerny Trading Bureau, has addressed, a meeting of Bankers warning them  regarding the-provisions  of  the  Trading with  the  Enemy  Act,  especially as  affecting foreign exchange.    Since the publication of the American Enemy Trading List, there has been a strong demand for the Statutory List.                            SHIPPING  SITUATION.   The following is  an abstract  of the  estimate accepted  by the Allied.  ShippingRepresentatives at the Paris Conference :    The total world tonnage now available is 45,000.000 tons deadweight, dividedapproximately as  follows : Allied.                           BritishNeutral..011S.ions.13,200,000       &apos;               23,000,000               8,800,000   Of the British tonnage,  3,000,000 tons are already allocated to  the Allies and afurther 750,000 might, at great sacrifice, be spared for Prance and Italy.   As to requirements, France and Italy  need, a further 1,750,000 tons deadweight(excluding oilers) from the United States of America, of which 500,000 tons are wantedimmediately,  ddie British Government finds ituiecessary to obtain 300,000 tons dead-weight  (tankers) from the United  States  of America, of which 100,000  tons  arerequired at once.   The above, based on a minimum output of 5,000,000 tons during 1918 by the UnitedStates  of America, should  admit of  transport  to  and  maintenance  in  ITance  of1,000,000 American troops  by the end  of 1918.   Any failing short  of this programme would have most  serious consequences, andthe hope was  expressed at  the Conference that it might be raised to 9,000,000 tons,which would enable world building to  overtake losses.  : A Committee appointed by the Anglo-American Conference, and sitting under thechairmanship of Lord Curaon, on 20th November 1917 resolved :    (I)  That America  and Great Britain should exchange  representatives, to  act in an          advisory capacity, and that each  of (die two  Governments  should  decide          for itself whether  it desired to  invite other allied  representatives to its          deliberations.  . That it  was   not  desirable  to  create   an   International          Executive  Committee to  control and  allocate shipping  available  to  the          Allies.   (2) That the Allies  should exchange  details  both of  the  requirements for which          tonnage is needed  and  of the tonnage available  and  prospective;  that          the total, tonnage should,  be continuously allocated to secure a reasonable          uniform standard  of adequacy both  as between  classes of commodities          and as between  countries ; that each nation should manage the tonnage          under its control.    (3) That neutral  and. interned  tonnage,  however obtained, should  be applied to          the war services of  the Allies in proportion to the urgency of their needs;          that steps  should be taken  to  secure all possible  tonnage of this nature;          that upon  this understanding,  Norwegian tonnage, other  than that already          allocated or excluded in existing circumstances, should be divided equally&apos;          between the United States of America  and Great Britain.   The  Committee expressed the  hope  that  the United  States Government would consider the  possibility of  requisitioning Dutch vessels now sheltering in Americanharbours.
PEACE  DISCUSSIONS.   Sir E. Howard reports that Mr. Vorovski, official representative in Sweden  of the bolshevist Government, has informed  the  Stockholm correspondent  of a  Budapestpaper  that he has been authorized to conduct peace negotiations with any enemyGovernment.  Mr. Vorovski announces the  Bolshevist view to he that after arrange-ments  for an  armistice have been settled, the negotiations for peace should proceedupon  neutral  soil.   The  Swedish  Social  Democrat states that  Vorovski has beennegotiating secretly  with  Parvus,  the  German  Minority  Socialist, and   observesthat  Scheidemaiin has also  been for  some  days   in Stockholm.   it attacks  these negotiations  as hypocrisy  under  the  name  of International  Socialism, and as onlylikely, to assist German Imperialism.   According   to   the  German  wireless Press   the  Ukrainian   Press  Bureauannounces from Kiev: &quot;The Ukrainian General  Secretary has been commissioned&quot; by Parliament to send  an official  representative of   Ukrainia to the  armistice&quot; negotiations with the enemy  on  the  south-western front  and. on  the  Rumanian&quot; front,   ddie Ukrainian Parliament is working upon  a  concrete peace programme,&quot; based,  on. the foundation  of  recognition  by  foreign  Powers of  the  Ukrainian&quot; Republic as a constituent part of the Russian Federal Republic.  This programme,,  with: a proposition for immediate negotiations  Cor peace  is  to he laid before ah&quot; belligerent Governments.&quot;   Sir G. Barclay intimates that, in  view  of the final  cessation  of hostilities by russia, and.  a notification, by the Ukraine  Government  that it desires peace  at anyprice,  Rumania will  be compelled  to conclude peace in the course  of  the  next twomonths.  In  the  circumstances, he  suggests the desirability of British assent to anearly  peace   conditional  upon  the  destruction of military  material.  Delay  might lead to the conclusion of a pro-Germtm peace by a  pro-German Cabinet.                                    OENERAU.   Sir W. Townley learns that Norking Camp  was visited by  Dr.  boomer  on 4thDecember.    All. conditions  were found to be good.  It appeared, that occasionallypackages were  missing,   ddie work &quot;done  by the  prisoners  had no  connection withmunitions of  -war.   Sir H. Rumbold understands that the British delegates at Berne have produced afavourable impression  on the Ottoman delegates.   Mouktar  is reported as saying thatit was easy to see the Turks could not remain enemies of England.   It also appearsthat the ill-treatment of British  prisoners is chiefly due to  Enver Bey and to ColonelSefi,  Director of  Political Affairs at  the Ottoman Ministry of War.   It seems not impossible  that the Germans or  Austrians  might attack a ship  conveying  prisoners from Egypt to the Turkish coast.    Sir H. Rumbold learns from  the Swiss Government that a hospital train containing90 British, 10 French, and 400  Serbians will leave Austria as soon as a correspondinghospital train from France arrives in Switzerland.
