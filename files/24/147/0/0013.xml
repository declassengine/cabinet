SECRET,APPRECIATION OF  THE  ATTACHED  WESTERN  AND  GENERAL                           REPORT,  No.  38.                                    CANADA.   The appointment of a Canadian High Commissioner in Washington is a significantindication of the volume and importance of the financial and commercial transactions which the Canadian Government now has  to  deal with in the United States.  Thereshould be no difficulty in associating the new High Commissionership so closely withthe British Embassy as to prevent any possibilitj- of confusion or overlapping of work.But the step also emphasises  the growing  necessity of Imperialising the diplomatic service.   Our Embassies are, after  all,  the Canadian or Australian Embassies as wellas the Embassies of the United Kingdom,  and it is  a constitutional anachronism thatthey are still staffed  almost exclusively from  the United Kingdom,  dim time will nodoubt come  when it will be the natural and obvious thing  that the British ambassador in Washington should be a Canadian.   The Coalition Ministry is now complete, and the Liberal element in it, includingmen like  Mr.  Carvell,  who  was  recently discussed  as the  possible  successor  toSir W. Laurier as the Party leader, Mr. Sifton, Premier  of  Alberta, and Mr. Powell,Liberal leader in Ontario, should be strong enough to secure its success at the elections and its power  to carry through its programme.                                    FUANOK.    M.  Painleve&apos;s handling of  the charges  brought against M. xdalvy by M. LeonDaudet,  does  not appear  to have  been skilful,  and,  according   to  this  m.orning&apos;press,  a reshuffling  of  the  Ministry,  possibly  under  another  Prime  Minister,  isimminent.  It is not clear how far the attitude of the Chamber towards the Govern-ment was influenced  by the discussion, in  secret session,  of  the &quot; whispers  of peace &quot;which M. Ribot hinted last week had  reached him  from Germany.                                ENEMY AFFAIRS.   The KaisePs tour to Sofia  and Constantinople is  no doubt connected with im-pending enemy operations both in the military and diplomatic sphere.  The occupationof Moldavia, and the recapture of  Bagdad, or  invasion  of Trans-Caucasia, would, ofcourse, admirably reinforce a determined peace, offensive in the AVest, and so Bulgarsand  Turks are being well flattered  by the All-Highest in  person  to spur them on tofresh efforts, wdiile von Kuhlmann is busy making preparations for his great winterpeace campaign.
                                    GERMANY.   The growing reaction against the relatively moderate tendencies  embodied in  theReichstag Majority resolution  seems to have  been checked by Admiral von Capelle&apos;sblundering attempt  to  fasten the  responsibility of  the recent  naval mutiny on  the minority Socialists,  and by  Dr. von .fielilerich&apos;s no  less  clumsy  treatment of  theinterpellation about the anti-Reichstag propaganda in  the Army.  Tactlessness is theAchilles&apos; heel of the German bureaucrat at home, as it  is of his equally painstakingand eflicient diplomatic confrere abroad.                                    HOLLAND.   The Dutch Government has  by its official communique appealed to the public tosupport it over the  sand and gravel question.  If Dutch obstinacy is once roused thequestion will not be easy to settle.                                     SWEDEN.    The composition of the new Cabinet seems satisfactory from the Allied  point ofview.  Rut  it  would not  be  wise to build, too great hopes  on  this of  the futuretfactability  of  Sweden.  R:o Government can afford  to make concessions if  Swedishpride  and  obstinacy are once thoroughly roused.  Meanwhile, Germany&apos;s credit  has probably risen again in  Sweden by the capture of Oesel, and by her bluffing offer tosupply potatoes and even wheat.18th October 1917.L. S. A.

PART  I.-BRITISH  EMPIRE  AND AFRICA.                                    CANADA.    After lengthj conferences with leading Liberals  from different parts of Canada,Sir Robert Borden  lias  succeeded  in the  formation  of  a  Union  Government.According to the official announcement the  conferences were  &quot; characterised by the&apos;&quot; very earnest, sincere purpose on  the part of all concerned to bring  about the4i formation of a Union or National Government.&quot;    The following form the new Ministry :      Prime Minister and Secretary of  State for       External Affairs       ...   g]r R. Borden (Con.).    President of the Privy Council -        .-   Mr.  N. W. Rowell  (Lib.).    Minister of Finance       -       -          Sir Thomas White (Con.).

Minister of Trade and Commerce        -   Sir George Foster (Con.).    Minister of Agriculture       -         -   Mr.  T. A. Crerar (Lib.).    Minister of Justice       -                 Mr.  C. J. Doherty (Con.).    Solicitor-General      -                -   Mr.  Hugh Guthrie (Lib.).    Minister of Railways and Canals -       -   Dr.  J. D. Reid (Con.).    Minister of the Interior -      -         -   Mr.  A. Meighen (Con.).    Minister of Customs      -                 Mr.  A. L. Sifton (Lib.).    Secretary of State     -      -         -   Mr.  M.

Minister of Inland Revenue      -       -   Mr.  A. Sevigny  (Con.).    Minister of  Marine,  Fisheries and Naval       Service  -         -        -         -   Mr.  C. G. Ballantviie  (Lib.).

Miaister&apos;of Labour  -                     (Not yet appointed.)    Of  the Liberals  who have accepted  office, it  is  to  be  noted  that only two, Mr. F. B. Carvel! (Member for Carleton, N.B.), and  Mr. Hugh  Guthrie  (Member  for-S.  Wellington, Out.),  are members  of  the present House  of Commons.   Mr. N.  W. Rowell is a member of  the  Ontario Legislative Assembly, and has  been Leader of the liberal Party in the Province since  191], while Mr. A. L. Sifton  is Premier of Alberta.   Mr.  T. A.  Crerar is President of the Manitoba Grain  Growers&apos; Association, Major-General Mewburn  joined the Militia as  a Private and during the  war has been General Officer Commanding and Adjutant-General  of the Militia, Mr. Ballantyne  has been Harbour  Commissioner of Montreal,  and  Mr,  J. A. Calder has held the offices of Minister of  Railways  and Minister  of Education in the Saskatchewan Provincial Government.   There  is unfortunately an  absence of representation in the Cabinet of French-speaking Liberals ; but  Mr. P. E.  Blondin and Mr.  A.  Sevigny,  who both served in Sir  R. Borden&apos;s previous administration, represent the French-speaking Conservatives  of Quebec Province.    Mr. N. W.  Rowell presided at the first meeting of the new Cabinet.   It  has been proposed  that four  Conservatives  and three  Liberals should form an  Inner War- -Cabinet for the conduct of war matters.    The Dominion Government have decided to appoint a representative at Washington,: and  the  office will probably  be  known as that of High Commissioner  in the United States.  Mr. J. D. Hazen (late Minister of Marine, Fisheries and  Naval Service)  has been offered and has accepted the post.    Sir George Perley has been offered  and has accepted the office of  Permanent HigL -Commissioner for the Dominion in London, and this has involved his retirement from Parliament and also from the Cabinet.  While  Acting-High Commissioner, Sir George
Perley has also been  Minister for Overseas Military Forces, and be will no doubtcontinue to discharge the duties of the  latter office until the arrival of Sir EdwardKemp in London.   The date of the last-named event must necessarily depend largely upon the course of  political events in Canada, but the new Canadian Minister is not expected before 1st December.    A Proclamation under the Military Service Act calling up Class I., being unmarriedmen and childless widowers between the ages of 20 and 34, was issued on 13th October.Though the men are required to report themselves on or before 10th November, unless they have applied for exemption, the first draft will not be called to the colours, under present arrangements,  till 10th December.    The personnel of the exemption tribunals is  now complete, and the tribunals  willcommence their sittings  on Sth  November.  All men exempted from service in the overseas Forces will be drafted for service in the Home Defence Forces unless they arephysically unfit or are employed on national work of vital importance.  Men serving inthe Home Defence Army must put in. at least 14 hours&apos; drill per week and must servewithout pay.    Up to 6th October last  28,609  men in the Dominion had  submitted themselves to voluntary medical  examination, and of  these 12,597  were placed in category A  as fit for general military service.    According to figures issued by the Militia Department for the eight months  from january to August inclusive, the total enlistments in the Overseas Forces were 49,179,while the wastage during the same period (including  casualties  and men discharged)amounted to  91,804.    In reply to the  suggestion of the  British Government that the Dominion Govern-ment should  make  use.of  the  opportunity afforded b3r the negotiations with certainCanadian railways to obtain the fullest powers  possible over the  telegraph systemsassociated with the railways [vide Report No.  30), the Canadian Ministers point outthat they have statutory powers to take over any electric telegraph in the Dominionon payment of reasonable  compensation.   During last Session a statute authorised theDominion Government to buy the  outstanding stock  of  the  Canadian  NorthernRailway, and this carried the control of the  Canadian Northern  Telegraph and GreatNorth-Western  Telegraph Companies.  In short, the Government  have control   over one-half of the telegraph lines of Canada ; and,  in view of their rights of  acquisitionin regard to all lines, the  Dominion Government could enter  into any arrangement inconnection with Pacific and Atlantic Cables, &amp;c.    It  is reported  from Ottawa that 65  representatives of  workers have  formed aCommittee to  draw up a constitution and  choose a designation  for an IndependentLabour Party.    In the Report  of  the  Executive  Council  of the Trades and Labour  Congresspresented last month to the delegates assembled at. Ottawa, the following recommen-dation was  made : &quot;Let no obstacle  be placed in the way of reaching the German&quot; people through the medium of a Stockholm Conference, or otherwise, for the purpose&quot; of conveying to them our intentions, and on what basis permanent peace is likely to&quot; be established/&apos;    Twenty-two  steel vessels of from 3,400 to 8,800 tons, which are being  constructedin Canada for the British  Government, are expected to be launched this year or  earlyin 1918.  It  is intended that  the  vessels shall  carry supplies from the Dominion tothe United Kingdom.    The  Dominion  Government have  undertaken to  give the British authorities the refusal of any ocean-going tugs, registered in Canada, before  transfer to a  foreign flagis permitted.    The Dominion  Government have enquired whether it is desired  that the defencesat Esquimalt should continue to be manned  as at present, in view of the existing naval.situation in the Pacific.                      AUSTR A LIAN  COMM O N W E ALTH.   ddie allegations of corruption  against  the  Prime Minister which were made  bySenator Watson in connection wdth appointments  to  the Senate, and  which  had animportant bearing upon  the  last General  Election (vide  Report No.  6)  have  been withdrawn, and the libel action brought  by Mr. Hughes against Senator Watson has there fore been settled.  -
    The Honorary Minister  (Mr.  L.  E.  Groom) is communicating with the AustralianUniversities  with regard to co-operation in teaching Japanese  and  the  languagesof the Pacific Islands in the  Commonwealth.    ddie Minister for Home and Territories (Mr. Glynn) has announced that there are good prospects of Papua becoming self-supporting in the near future.    The Premier  of New South  Wales (Mr. Holman), in the course of his visit to canada, cabled to the Attorney-General of the State  (Mr. Hall) and  to  Mr.  Vaughaii(ex-Premier of South  Australia) suggesting, in view  of  the  forthcoming  GeneralElection,  that  they should  visit the Dominion  on behalf of  the National Service-Committee and address meetings in favour of conscription.   Both these gentlemenhave accepted  the invitation.   Sir  C. Spring Pice in  a despatch  mentions thatMr. Holman made a great impression in the United  States.    Idle transcontinental railway, connecting Port Augusta in  South Australia  withKalgoorlie in; Western Australia (vide Report No.  17) has been completed, and thefirst passenger train will run on 22nd October.   The line is 1,051 miles in length andhas taken five years to construct at a cost of 6,000,000i.                               NEW  ZEALAND.    The Dominion Government suggest that the United  States should be  approached.with a view to co-ordinating the methods of censorship of news of naval or military importance.   The New Zealand Ministers  point  out  that with regard  to  the recentcapture in Fiji of the occupants of a launch belonging  to  the  German raider in the pacific, the news was censored in the Dominion but published in full in the Americannewspapers.    The Ministers  further express their opinion  that it is very undesirable that thesailings of New Zealand vessels from San  Francisco should continue to be published in  the American  Press, and  they  ask  for an assurance that  this publication  shall-cease.                               SOUTH  AFRICA.    due Union Ministers have suggested that, in  view of  the earnest representations made by the South African Mohair&apos;Growers&apos; Association, and many other producers, infavour of the inclusion of mohair in. the offer made for wool and wooled sheepskins,the British Government might reconsider  their decision and  purchase such portions of the forthcoming clip as the growers  may desire to offer.  The value of the clip isnot expected to exceed  1,000,OOOZ.    The Union Government  have pointed out the  inequality which exists between theNative Labour Contingent serving in France and  the Native Labour Corps serving inGerman  East Africa in respect of  compensation payable  to those dying- of diseasewhilst on  service.   For natives serving in France, the scale ranges from 30Z. to 501.,while for those in  East Africa from 101. to 15Z.   The  Ministers  consider the  latterscale altogether inadequate and urge that it should be raised to the former, the higherscale being already in operation in the East African unit in respect of deaths resultingfrom accident or injury. The additional expense involved  in  unifying  the awards of-compensation, would be about  2O,0O0Z.    The Union Ministers have  been considering a  proposal to permit Native prisoners,other than those undergoing sentences for the more  serious crimes, to volunteer for service in  France in separate formed companies of  the  Native  Labour  Contingent.For this  purpose the sentences would be remitted and the prisoners would, be attested-on release and serve for the duration of  the war.   It is estimated  that 4,000 labourerscould be secured in this way,  and. the views of the Army Council  are sought upon theproposal.                 SOUTH-WEST  AFRICAN  PROTECTORATE.    An interesting report upon the South-West African Protectorate has  been givento the  Capetown Chamber of Commerce by Mr. L. Woodhead,  M.L.A.,  a member ofthe Parliamentary Delegation  which  recently toured the country.  In  the course ofhis observations the  lecturer said : &quot;The diamond industry at Kolmanskop is in full&quot;&quot;swing.   Up-to-date  machinery has been installed, costing  some 150,000L, all of  German  make ....  The  Union is starving for marble ; at Karibib, alongside the    4073-3                         &apos; .   B
 &quot; railway, are unequalled marble quarries ; some blocks shown to us exceeded 16 tons &quot; in weight ....  Mealies are grown to perfection at Grootfontein, and the Adminis- &quot; tration are buying them direct from  the  farmer for local use at 16s. per bag, free &quot; bag, free station.&quot;  As to general prospects, Mr. Wood head  says : &quot;The  more one &quot; sees of the country the more one is  impressed with  its possibilities.  Anyone  with &quot; 1,000L or 2,00OL, and getting the land reasonably, must do well.  Land  is said  to &quot; be sold at from  Is.  to Is.  bd. per hectare a hectare being  equal to about one &quot; morgen.   The  land  tenure presents  difficulties, as most  of the  land is held by &quot; German and British companies, and little remains for disposal by the Government.&quot; The report further states that the country is rich in mineral wealth, diamonds,  copper, lead, tin, iron, marble, wolfram, and galena ; it carries all kinds of stock, cattle, sheep,. goats, horses, pigs ; and wheat  and  mealies grow  well.  The rainfall varies from 14 inches in the south to as much as 21- inches  at  Grootfontein.  Native  labour  is stated&apos;to be  scarce as the original population  of 80,000 Hereros  has been reduced through  brutal slaughter,  &amp;c. to  18,000.  There is, however, a small Republic  of 4,000 Bastards, owning each from 7,000 to 10,000 hectares of land, recognised by the Germans,  and  having  their  own Parliament of  10  members.   Mr. Woodhead emphasises that the country is not suitable for settlement by poor whites.                                 WEST INDIES.    The  Secretary of State has requested1 that the exportation of sea  island  cotton shall be forthwith prohibited, except by Government, and notification published  that owing to the difficulty in  obtaining sufficient supplies for aeronautical purposes, the British  Government have found it necessary, in Imperial interests,  to acquire all the sea island  cotton  produced in the British West Indies for munition purposes.   The Secretary of State  observes that he relies on. the patriotic co-operation of the  &quot;planters, and states  that the commodity will he  bought, ginned, baled and delivered at the port of shipment, and  the planters therefore will  be relieved, of  all difficulties  as  to theprovision of tonnage.          1 Telegrams sent to Governors of Leeward and Windward Islands, and Barbados.PART  II.-FOREIGN  AFFAIRS.                                ALLIED  AFFAIRS.    Arrangements  have been  made for the closer  co-operation between the United States and the Allied  Powers  in military affairs  and. in the control,  of  supplies from the United States.   Colonel House will shortly arrive in. London as the United States representative to attend a specially  convened War Conference of the Allies.    Sir G. Buchanan  reports  that  for some  time  past  the  Russian Socialists have insisted that the Russian Democracy should be represented at the forthcoming Allied Conference by someone who enjoyed  their entire confidence.   The Foreign Minister, while prepared to accept a Socialist like M. Skobeleff, the former Minister of Labour, as his colleague, has informed  a Socialist Deputation that  as Head of the Mission to- be  accredited to the Conference, he will reserve to himself the sole right to initiate any discussion or to speak in the name of Russia.   Furthermore, while the Conference lasted, all subordinate members of the Mission will have to conform their attitude with his and take their instructions  from him as Head of the Mission.    The  Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs lias suggested that the Conference should not meet before the middle of  November as he  could not arrange to leave Petrograd before the beginning of that month.                                    FRANCE.    According to the Intelligence Bureau&apos;s Report  on France  for the  week ending 11th October, the question of Civil Control of  the Army (vide Report No. 3G, page 6)has been settled by what seems to  be an almost complete surrender to the demands,
of the Chamber.   Parliamentary control of  the Army has been incessantly demanded,especially by the  Radical and  Socialist  Left, and they have now got substantiallywhat they asked.   The control  is officially  announced  as &quot; general and permanent,&quot;but the Parliamentary delegates are forbidden to touch military operations in  anyway.  No officers  are to accompany them except at their  own  request.  It must besupposed that General Retain found that he could not resist, and  therefore- accepted.with so good  a grace  that the Grand Quartier  General  has  won  the applause of&quot; Le Pays &quot; for its active assistance in smoothing over difficulties.    This concession  is among the Party aims laid down in the  Socialist Programmeadopted by the Bordeaux Conference.  Lord Bertie enumerates the others, to wit, an inter-All led Agreement about effectives, providing for the demobilisation of  the olderFrench &quot; classes &quot; ;  the reformation of the personnel of the  French Diplomatic service so as to adapt it for the necessities of the war of democracies against autocracies, theinstitution of open diplomacy which would inform Parliament fully and precisely of inter-Allied Agreements, the realisation of measures preparatory for the establishmentof  a society of nations ; the rigorous application  of  the law against intercourse withthe enemy ; and  the adoption of a fiscal  policy  based on  the  impossibility of  warprofits.    The Malvy communique has given rise to criticism in the Chamber, and the PrimeMinister was asked  to fix  a day for its discussion.  lie  declined  to do so until afterthe conclusion of  the judicial inquiry.   Lord Bertie reports that a further refusal ledto  a division in which the  action of the  Ministry was upheld by 246 votes to  189,which, shows a falling off of some 200 in its majority.    Many speakers at the Bordeaux Conference attacked the imperialistic war aims ofItaly,  and M. Thomas declared  for a  Socialist Conference at  Stockholm  which wasnot to vote for an immediate peace, but  to establish the responsibilities for war, andespecially those of the German Socialists who by  their felony had  betrayed  the causeof the International.    These resolutions coloured the  subsequent debate  in the Chamber.  Replying toattacks  on  the   &quot;political   and  diplomatic  action of   the  Government MM. Briandand Ribot defended French diplomacy in  the  past while  recognising that it wouldhave to be reorganised for the future owing to the growth  of  the  industrial  andeconomic  factors  in modern  international  relations.   M.  Ribot pointed out  thatGermany had compromised  herself all. over the world owing to the excessive zeal ofher diplomatic representatives,  and referred  to the united  front shown by the  allies in the face of the  political  manoeuvres upon which the Germans, beaten militarily and economically, were now  forced to rely.   The order  of  the day declaring for thevigorous  political  direction of the war based on a plan concerted with the Allies, andfor the initiation of reforms in the Foreign Office and  Diplomatic  Service, as well asin  the methods   of recruiting,  was  adopted by  362  votes  to  112.   The  Socialistsopposed the Government.    Lord Bertie reports that an  official communique has been issued stating that thecharges of treason  preferred against M. Malvy, the former . Minister of the Interior,have been shown by  enquiry to  be  groundless.  The Ambassador learns that  thiscommunique was  issued in  obedience to political pressure  exercised by the RadicalSocialist Party and was not supported by all members of the Cabinet,  as it constitutesan  executive intervention  in a case still,  sub judice  and is calculated to hamper the officials who are conducting the judicial inquiry.    Sir II. Rumbold learns  that the former valet of  the  ex-Khedive  is prepared to give evidence, if required, about the meetings which took place between Bolo and his former-employer.    M. Loucheur, the Minister of Armaments, has dealt firmly and satisfactorily withthe workmen on strike  at  the Renault Aviation Works (vide Report No. 36, page 6).He refused to  examine their grievances so Jong  as the strike lasted, and  secured a resumption of work and  an expression of confidence on the part of  the men  in hisinterpretation of the arbitration!                                     ITALY.    The question of the orange purchase (vide Reports Nos. 33, page 8, and 37, page8)is upon the eve of settlement.  The quantity to be taken over is 70,000 tons, and inreturn for this the Italian  Government will undertake to  stop  the  export  of  citrusfruits and their products to enemy  countries.  The total liability,  including expenses
of marketing, transport, and insurance, is not expected to exceed 1,300,000L, and maybe  reduced to 300,0001. should adequate  tonnage be available for  the transport toGreat  Britain, of such  oranges as cannot be absorbed  in Egypt or by the Army inFrance and Macedonia.   France is being asked to  share  the  risk, which is  small  in comparison with the resiilts to be  obtained  in depriving the  enemy of the  citrusfruits products, and avoiding political troubles in Sicily.    Lord Bertie learns that the french Government on the representations of M. met in,the Under Secretary for Blockade, have  agreed to participate  with Great Britain inthe orange risk.    The  Italian  Government have  agreed  to  allow  Indian labourers to be landed atTaranto  in transit for France, provided that at no time more than. 3,000 are in that townat  one time,  and that  the  most stringent  sanitary measures  be enforced.  (vide report No. 37, page 8.)    In  a recent interview with Mr. Capel Cure, General Cadorna said that if any Frenchartillery were sent him  he hoped  it would be  without the French gunners.  &quot; Your&quot; men have worked splendidly  and never given me trouble.  The French gunners, on&quot;&quot; the other hand, do nothing but complain and preach republicanism in a monarchical&apos;&apos; country.&quot;                                   BELGIUM:    According to &quot; The Times,&quot; Baron Mongheur, formerly Belgian Minister in Mexico,Washington, and Constantinople, has been appointed Minister in London vice M. PaulHymans.                                   GREECE.    Lord Granville has been informed  by the Hellenic Minister for Foreign  affairs that arrangements have been agreed to  by the French and Italian authorities for the mutual evacuation of the four villages of Sarandaporos, Izvor, Verbiani, and Denchikoto the east of the Liaskovik-Hersek line in Northern Epirus (vide Reports No. 35, page 8,No. 36, page 8, No. 37, page 8).   In consequence  of this,  the Italians have consented to evacuate Konitza, Molitsa, and Kastanieh, which they occupied byway of exercisingpressure on the  French  to  secure simultaneous  evacuation winch has  now  beenobtained.    The Italian military occupation is to be maintained in the  triangle controlling theSanti Quaranta road, but  the  reinstatement of the Hellenic  civil administration isimminent.   Lord Granville has a low opinion of the Greek gendarmes in this particulardistrict, as  they  are Constantinist  ragamuffins deeply implicated in the recent perse-cutions  of  Venizelists,  and recommends their removal in the  interests of Hellenicprestige, in Anew of the fact  that  their behaviour and  appearance would contrastmost unfavourably with that of the Italians.    The French have offered Italy the sole control of Preveza as an Italian naval zone,under the ultimate command of  the French Commander-in-Chief, and Lord Granvillehas been informed that the French believe this offer will.be accepted.    Lord Granville reports that, according to present arrangements, M. Venizelos will leave Athens oh 22nd October, and will arrive in London about the end of the  month,after staying three or four days at each of the Allied capitals en route.  He expects toremain  in London for  a week  or ten days, and will stay longer in Paris and Romeon his return journey.    Lord Granville&apos;s suggestion that M. Venizelos should be offered a passage onboard aBritish warship, as this would have a good effect, and also spare him a tiresome journeyin a Greek destroyer from the Piraeus to Taranto, has been approved by the ForeignOffice.                                   SERBIA.    Sir C. des Graz reports that M. Pashitch, the Prime Minister, returned to Corfu on13th October from his visit  to Salonika, and that a decision  has  been reached totransfer the rest  of the Serbian Government from Corfu  to Salonika during the nextfew weeks.
                               MONTENEGRO.   Mr. Graham reports from Paris that as the the United States have agreed to acceptthe diplomatic representation  of Montenegro  in  Washington,  King Nicholas  has announced his intention of proposing  M. Plamenatz,  one of  his former Ministers forEoreign Affairs, for the new post.                                   ALBANIA.   The British  Liaison  Officer at  Gorfn  reports  that the  Italian authorities  havenotified the Inter-allied  Passport Control that Albanians are to  be  considered  asItalian subjects requiring Italian  passports for leaving Albania.   He has  asked theBritish Charge dAffaires in Rome  to make  a ruling as  to  whether Albanians areItalian subjects or not.  ddre Eoreign Office has  instructed Mr. Erskine to warn theLiaison Officer that Albanians are  not  to be considered  as  Italian subjects as theItalian Protectorate is construed in a dictionary and not in a diplomatic sense.                          ENEMY  ALLIED  AFFAIRS.   Sir W. Townley forwards German and Bulgarian Press reports of  the  EmperorWilliands cordial reception in Soda where he was received by Tsar  Ferdinand.   Thisappears to be  the  outcome of the arrangements for a  meeting of the four EnemyEmperors (vide Report No. 37, page 9), but the Emperor  Charles was not present, andas the Emperor William has been obliged to prolong his journey  to Constantinoplein order to see the Sultan  Mohammed Reshad,  it is improbable that that Prince evervisited. Sofia.                              GERMAN  AFFAIRS.   Sir H. Rumbold learns that the inhabitants of Cologne and  the  adjacent towns ofRhenish  Prussia  are much exercised  in mind  at  the  prospect  of being visited by allied raiding aeroplanes.   Writing to Mr. Balfour on 1st October the British Minister at The Hague considersthat  Germany is more  set  upon war now than was the case during  the  spring  audsummer  and refers to the  apparent decline  of  Social Democracy  in  public esteem.This  is partly clue to a revulsion against the Russian Revolution which would appearto have consolidated rather than undermined  the power of the Throne in the CentralEmpires, and partly to the strenuous propaganda of the German Patriotic. Party.   According to extracts from the German Press telegraphed by  Sir W. Townley, the leader of this Party now has an opportunity for recovering an official position.  Admiralvon  Oapelle has resigned  owing to his blunder  in dealing  with the  IndependentSocial Democrats over the  Naval mutiny, and Grand Admiral von Tirpitz, in spite ofhis  untrustworthiness  as  a prophet  in connexion with  the submarine campaign,is being talked  of as his successor.   On  the  other hand the Grand  Admiralmay disdain the Secretaryship  for  the  Navy when there is  every prospect  that theChancellorship itself wdll  shortly bo vacant as a  result of  the  widespread agitation against its present incumbent.   Dr. Michaelis is considered to  be compromised in theMutiny  Affair which  has  already overthrown von Oapelle,  and while Herr  vonKiihlmann  enjoys a great deal of well-organised  Press support it is possible that sofaithful and  uncompromising a Pan-German  annexation]st as the Grand Admiral maybe preferred by the advocates of  a German Peace to  a  diplomatist who is reputed tobe tainted with Anglophilisin and is considered by many to be dangerously &quot;clever,&quot;while he is notoriously unsound on the  question of annexations.   Another candidate for the succession to  the  Chancellorship  is  Prince von Billow.   The Socialist Presscalls not only for the dismissal of Dr. Michaelis, but for the recognition of the positionof the Reichstag in connection with the support it may accord to the Chancellor, andfor the appointment of a new Cabinet.    According to the Berlin correspondent of the &quot;  Tyd,&quot; the appointment of  Herr vonJviihlmann in phaoe of Dr. Michaelis is imminent.  This would indicate a desire on      4073-3                       .     c
lie part of  the German. Government to escape from  the  excessive ambitions  of the pan-Germans, and endeavour  to steer  a middle  course involving the abandonment ofBelgium, but the maintenance of the territorial  integrity  of  the Empire.   CountReventlow  strongly criticises  von Kuhlmann  and  his  policy  as  &quot; short-sighted,superficial, and bound  to have fatal results.&quot;   That this policy can, however, commandSocialist support is shown from the speech of  Herr Scheidemann, who, when speakingat the Conference of  the Social  -Democratic Party, declared amid  general applausethat &quot;Alsace is  German territory, and the integrity of  the  Empire is  our peacecondition.&quot;   Even before  the Mutiny Affair the Chancellor  had lost  the  support  of the Pan-Germans as is apparent from the reports of the meeting of the Pan-German League  atCassel.   The President, Herr Claas, animadverted, strongly upon  the  lack of determi-nation shown by Dr. Michaelis, particularly in handling the Polish question and in his reply to the Papal Peace Note.   He wound up by expressing joy at the attitude of theEntente statesmen which made the continuation of the war  necessary and thus enabledPan-Germans to enlighten the people  as to the necessity for a &quot; German Peace,&quot; gavetime  for  Germany to  win fresh  victories,  and allowed the idea to grow that  thepolitical results of the Avar must be made  to correspond, with its military successes.    In a recent  Press interview   Herr  Gwinner  of  the  Deutsche  Bank declaredthat the finances of Germany had  been  established  on  an  unshakable basis  bythe blockade,  owing to the compulsory saving on luxuries which could no  longer be imported, and the voluntary saving on clothes, lighting and food.  He drew attentionto the  great  growth  in the savings  banks deposits during the war in spite  of  thelarge subscriptions to  War Loans.    The Reichstag after  voting the supplementary Budget was  prorogued,  until  themiddle of December.  The Chancellor was  strongly attacked by Herr Ledebour andaccused of having perpetrated a knavish  trick in trying to  fasten the responsibilityfor the  Naval Mutiny upon  the   Independent  Socialists, and  the  appointment of herr  vou Hellferich as Yice-Chancellor was  criticised  on the ground, that it was idleto call in a failure to make up for the uselessuess and incapacity of Dr. Michaelis.    In conformity with the Hindenburg policy of ascribing German disasters at homeand abroad to the malignity or niggardliness of  the Reichstag, the Pan-German Pressexpress pleasure at the prorogation, wdiich excites the indignation of  the advocates ofParliamentary control.  Idle Reichstag is, however, strongly criticised by the SocialistPress  for- not having overthrown Dr. Michaelis, whose removal from office  is now generally demanded as having allowed a situation, to arise which enables the enemiesof Germany to look  forward to  a  collapse in German)7 comparable  with that inRussia.    Baron von Hording, the Bavarian  Prime Minister, who has  just  returned  from a visit  to Berlin, speaking in the Bavarian  Lower House, emphasised the necessity  for obtaining political and economic safeguards against any danger from Belgium in thefuture.  He advocated the incorporation of  Alsace and Lorraine in  South Germanyand Prussia respectively, and denied that any settlement had. been reached, as to thefuture of the Reichsland (vide Report No. 36, page 17).    The &quot; Vorwaerts &quot; of .13th October  protests against  the policy of  the German Patriotic Party  as laid down in the new appeal circulated over the signatures of Duke Johann Albrecht  of  Meekleiiburg-Schwerin, Grand Admiral von Tirpitz and  Herr Kapp.   This policy, according to the Socialist journal, is one of fear lest the growing- popular movement may develop  into one of political significance and affect the power of the classes  which now  enjoy it.   The journal  criticises  the  Government  for permitting  the  new  Party so openly  to  attack its  foreign  policy in newspapers subsidised by war-profiteers.    Dr Riesser, President of  the  Hanseatic League, took the chair at  a  meeting in Berlin on 8th October of mercantile and  shipping interests, at which it was decided that all State interference with business, while admittedly necessary during the period of reconstruction, must be  severely restricted during  that  period, and  completely abolished after it had. come to an end.   This refers also to the compulsory syndicates set up during the war which constitute  far-reaching usurpations  of  the rights of members  of the syndicates, irreconcilable  with  the protection of medium-sized and small industries.  All stoppages  and  amalgamations of concerns  must come to  an end, as the expected advantages of this policy have, even under war conditions, been heavily outweighed by the disadvantages in the  loss of efficiency.   After the war  trade must recover its former freedom,  and  every effort must be made that raw materials should
be obtained and distributed in the interests of commerce and industry,  The principleof monopolies must be abolished.   These resolutions were passed unanimously.                             AUSTRIAN  AFFAIRS.   The Hungarian Prime Minister, Dr. Wekerle, has announced that  he has obtainedKing Charles&apos; &quot; express assurance &quot;  that  the  introduction of autonomy  for racialareas in Austria would  have no  effect  either direct or indirect upon the integrity  ofHungarian  territory,  and  the  Austrian  Prime  Minister,  Dr.  Seidler,  in orderto  soothe  the  indignation of  the  Magyars,  lias had to repudiate  any  designsagainst the existing system of Dualism in the Monarchy.   This means that for thetime  being, officially  at  any rate, any  idea of securing the support  of the SouthernSlavs at the price  of Trialism or offering them an  equal share in the Monarchy withthe Magyars has  been  abandoned,   The activities of the Southern Slavs in Austriahave, however, by no means abated, and in Croatia which is subject to Hungary, theyhave at least been able to extrude from office the nominees of  Budapest in favour  ofreputable Croatian patriots who have a free hand in the preparation of internal reforms.The fact that the Southern&apos;  Slavs in  the lands  of the  Austrian Crown are so openlyworking  for an independent state-unit, under the sceptre of the flabsburgs, which  is incompatible  with the  maintenance  of the Dual system, is largely  due to theparliamentary  position   of the Seidler Cabinet  which  cannot rely on  securing  amajority for its Budget in the face of opposition of the  Slav JJZoc.   In  Hungary properthere  is  no such  opportunity for racial self-assertion  as exists in Austria and (to a lesser  degree) in autonomous  Croatia.  The Wekerle policy is  to exalt  and maintainintact the  Magyar  domination at the expense  of the &quot; nationalities,&quot; or non-Magyarmajority, which are to  be  again politically gerrymandered into  submission to theMagyar  oligarchy, and  the Government has  now embarked  upon an attempt  to&quot; capture &quot; the hierarchical machinery of the Serb Orthodox and Rumanian OrthodoxChurches in Hungary in order to add ecclesiastical pressure to  that already exercised in political matters.   Sir W.  Townley reports a conversation  with a M. de Sincay, who has come out ofBelgium with the permission of the Germans, apparently iu connection with possible future peace overtures, in which  reference was made to the attitude of the EmperorCharles.    M.  de  Sincay  states  that the  Emperor,  when  recently  in Brussels,made it  clear that he was intent upon bringing  about peace  at any price,   lie hadbeen determined to do this when he first ascended the  throne,  but had  been diverted from his  purpose by the Russian Revolution and the fears, fostered in Berlin, that  itwould spread to Austria.  He had now overcome this fear and was again set upon peace.   In view of the outbreak of mutiny reported last week in the  German Navy it. is interesting to  note that an Austrian  torpedo-boat voluntarily  surrendered herself tothe Italians.                            13 U LGARI AN  affairs IRS.   Sir W.  Townley learns  that the Emperor  WilHands  visit to Sofia (vide EnemyAllied Affairs) has greatly  strengthened  the  position of the  Prime  Minister, M.Radoslavoff, to the detriment, of the Russophiles.   The Bulgarian Press claims thatthis visit definitely raises Bulgaria to the rank of a Great Power, an ambition moremodestly7 stated by M.  Daneff at the time of  the London Conference, when he claimed that the country had become, as a result of  the  First  Balkan.  War, &quot;tin  petit Grand.Puissance.&quot;                               NETHERLANDS.    In reply  to  the  intimation  of the British Government  that  commercial cable communication had  been suspended (vide Report No. 37, page 12), the Netherlands Government have issued an elaborate defence of their action in allowing the transit of sand, gravel and metal through Dutch territory for the convenience  of  the Germans. This document  emphasises  the  Treaty, obligations  binding the  Dutch to  allow&quot;unimpeded navigation of the Rhine waterways,  and  of  the permission accorded to a neutral  to  permit  the transit  even of  munitions to  a belligerent.   The Dutch
Government claim to Lave satisfied themselves that in point of fact the material  inquestion has not been used for warlike purposes, and take  credit for having stoppedthe transit of requisitioned metals from  Belgium to Germany.  They also claim that even if the materials have been used, for road  repair in Belgium, a road is really athing of peace though doubtless useful to belligerents in war.    Sir W. Tbwnley points out that the Dutch officers sent into Belgium to report  onthe application of the materials in question were not allowed into the area of immediate *hostilities, and that their inspection w-as limited  to that extent.   On the  other hand,.he  learns  that certain  Belgian experts  contend  that if the concrete of the  &quot; pill-boxes &quot; were to be  analysed the component parts would  be found  to  be of Germanorigin.    It appears that Governmental pressure has  been applied  in Holland in order to-secure a &quot; good Press &quot; for the official defence of the Dutch attitude, and the british minister is anxious that the British reply should be published as early as possible, themore so as popular opinion is by no means as yet unanimous in support of the Dutchofficial exculpation.    Sir  W.  Townley also reports  that  he  has  information  to the  effect  that  the-Germans intend to  resume the export of coal to  Scandinavian  ports by way  ofRotterdam.                                SWITZERLAND.   Sir II. Rumbold reports  that  the prolonged suspension of  transit rights for  Swissgoods  from. Holland through Germany is  causing annoyance in  Switzerland, whichis quite  out  of  proportion to  any advantage  which may  thereby  be  gained bythe Allies.   As the cause of the suspension was a minor incident beyond Swiss control,the British Minister  suggests that  the suspension  may -without  danger be  reversed(vide  Report  No. 33,  page 12).  The  Swiss  Government,  who  are grateful for theoffer of Egyptian oil-cake (vide  Report No. 35,  page  10),  are asking for additional facilities for importing this commodity as their present command of tonnage does not enable them to deal wdth so large an amount.   Sir H.  Rumbold  announces  the  appointment  as  head  of  the service for the controlling of  exports  of war material from Switzerland  of M. Gonnet the candidatefavoured by the Allies for the post.                                   SWEDEN.   ddie Cabinet  crisis  in  Sweden appears to have  been settled.   After ProfessorEden had  experienced  a preliminary failure to adjust the conditions of co-operationbetween the Liberals and the Socialists, Mr. Widen, Speaker  of the Lower House, was invited by the King on 11th October to  form a Ministry.  Lie failed, whereupon  the-King again sent  for Professor Eden on 14th October, and charged him to try again.Difficulties had been experienced in persuading the Socialists to forego their claim to-a majority of seats in the Cabinet in view of their numerical preponderance over the liberals in the House (80 to G2), as Baron Marks von Wurtenberg declined  to takethe  Foreign Office if there were  a  Socialist majority in   the Cabinet.  There was at one time a possibility   that the pro-German  Baron Ramel, at present SwedishMinister in  Christiania,  might have been  appointed in his stead, but a hint wasconveyed that such a nomination  could  hardly   be  expected  to   make  a goodimpression  in  the  Allied capitals.  The success   of  Professor  Eden  in  at lastreconciling the conflicting  interests of  the two parties  in his Coalition  is the moreimportant  in that  bis continued failure  in that   direction would  probably have led  to  a  continuance of the pro-German policy of  the late Administration under a conservative  Foreign Minister in a  patched-up  Cabinet of Royal nominees.   this danger was at one time  so  pressing that Sir E. Howard, in  company with  his Allied.colleagues, found it advisable to prepare a Note enumerating instances of the failureof the  two last Administrations to preserve the  impartial neutrality of Sweden, andhoping that the future actions of the country would be in conformity wdth its repeateddeclarations of loyalty to this principle.
    As far as is  at  present  known, according to Swedish Press reports the CoalitionMinistry,  which commands  148 votes in a  House of  230 members, includes thefollowing :      Prime Minister      ...   Professor Eden (Liberal).     Minister of Finance        -           -   Mr. Branting (Socialist).     Minister of War            -           -   Mr. Nilsson (Liberal).     Minister of Marine  -                     Baron  Palmstjerna (Socialist).    Idre Swedish Government has officially announced the conclusion of an Agreement&quot;with Germany for  the export to Sweden  of large quantities of grain and potatoes.Sir  P.  Paget is of opinion  that this is  partly bluff  to impress  the world with thefutility of the blockade, and  partly in order to enable  Sweden to resist the demandsof the United States to cease exporting certain goods  to Germany,  This  view findsconfirmation in the reported offer of similar facilities  by Germany to Norway (videGeneral).  Sir E. Howard understands that the wheat for export to Sweden is to heobtained by a 5  per cent, economy on the rations given to  the  inhabitants of the occupied territories.    Sir W. Townley learns that the supplies of Swedish iron ore received, in Germany,which amount to  2,400,000  tons, are  so  ample that  in view of  transit and labour shortage the Germans  have given  instructions  that the  consignments should be asmuch reduced, as possible during the winter.    Sir C. Spring Rice  reports  the arrival of the suspected Swedish diplomatic  bagsfront Halifax (vide Report No. 35, page 10), and that the  State  Department, which is anxious that we should not be too hard on Sweden at the  present  moment, advocatestheir being given up to the Swedish Minister in Washington unopened. Lord Readingstrongly supports the proposal of the State Department, and urges that  the bags be released.    The Swedish Government has published the text  of the German apology for theLuxburg affair, in which regret is  expressed  that the  telegrams complained of  were*ver sent.    Sir lb Howard reports  that  numbers  of revolvers  are said to have been stolenlately from  Swedish regiments  in  the  North, and  that  a motor launch manned byarmed Finns and loaded  with  ammunition  successfully beat off Swedish Customsofficers at Holmsund, near Umea, i-u the Gulf  of Bothnia.  The launch, when subse-quently captured; was found to contain rifles of  the German Army model.  It isthought that  these Finns have a depot of arms near  Umea, as the launch left  that port  empty.   This  depot may have been stocked partly with weapons  stolen as above,but  the Minister thinks the greater part of the supposed store must have been land dfrom enemy submarines.    Sir E. Howard reports that  Swedish public opinion has taken the  news of therequisition of Swedish shipping-very  quietly.    According to Press  reports  the Conference of Scandinavian Ministers  which wasdeferred owing to the change of Cabinet in Sweden  will now take place next month.                                   NORWAY.    The British Government has denounced  its Agreements with the Paper and Pulp-Makers and Mechanical Pulp-Makers, Soap Makers, Oil and Colour Merchants, Candleand Match Makers, Chocolate Makers.    Idle denunciations in the case of the first four will, take effect in three months from13th October.  The last-mentioned denunciation was ordered on  10th October,  andthe denunciation of  the Fish and Margarine Agreements is foreshadowed in  furthertelegrams to Sir M. Findlay of  12th and 13th October respectively.    The British Minister has been informed  by his  French  colleague that he has-certain information to the effect, that the Norwegian Government have informed theGerman Minister that they cannot avoid  reducing exports to Germany, and that thelatter  has asked  for time to enable his Government to consider whether  they cannotsupply Is1 or way&apos;s requirements^  The French Minister also asserts that the NorwegianCabinet has decided  not  to  make common  cause with  Sweden  and Denmark in resisting the pressure of the Allies.  -    Sir M. Findhiy  considers that the Norwegian Government -is  bluffing  when  it-assured the  French  Minister cn  13th October  that a total cessation of.exports toClermany could  not be considered, and Sir  C.  Spring  Rice reports  that  Dr. Nansen^     4073-3                              D
fhe Norwegian representative in the United States, expressed anxiety as to the attitudeof the Scandinavian countries in case the United  States Government persisted in itspresent demands, which had, however, not yet taken the form of an ultimatum.    Sir C. Spring Rice indicates  that the State Department, in view of Dr. Nansen&apos;s-assurances that  it  is impossible for Norway entirely to stop  the export  of. fish  to-Germany, is unwilling to insist upon its demand in writing.  The British Government,.however, are most anxious that this traffic should be totally stopped.                                  DENMARK.   Sir R.  Paget reports that the  Danes have decided  to slaughter for their ownconsumption, in addition to the normal slaughterings, a large number of pigs forsalting purposes, consequently  the quantities  available for export  will  after five months be  insignificant.  Sir C.  Spring Rice learns that the Danes intend to devotethe stock of fodders to the maintenance of their  cattle, and  reports  the  tentativedecision of the United States Export  Board in view of this action.  It is proposedto share Danish exports of dairy produce and  live and  dead meat equally between germany and the Allies, and to limit the export of  cattle to Germany to a  maximum of 2,000 head  in any one week.   4,000. tons of  hides per quarter are to be exported to approved destinations, and an arrangement is to be made about pork in addition tothe 20,000 tons which  are to be exported to  the Allies before the end of the yearwithout corresponding export to  Germany.   Sir It. Paget draws attention  to the import of German paper into Denmark for theuse of journals favourable  to the German propaganda, and suggests that an embargo on paper from Allied sources would, in consequence of  this, play into  the hands ofthe enemy.                                     SPAIN.   The United States Ambassador found the Prime Minister greatly exasperated withGermany over the submarine episode and has advised the State Department to makethe most of this opportunity in its dealings with Spain.  The Prime  Minister informed sir A. Ilardinge that the  action of the German  commander  of the submarine  inbreaking his word of honour has  created a bitter  feeling against Germany among theGennanopb.il military circles, and  if the German Government declines  to return thesubmarine  or quibbles  about the commanding; officers parole the best friends  ofGermany in Spain will be estranged.   In a conversation with the British Ambassador the Marquis de Lema, the SpanishMinister for -foreign Affairs, again suggested that a manifestation of goodwill  on thepart  of the Allies towards Spain  might take the form of arranging for the inclusion ofTangier in the Spanish zone in Morocco.   Sir A. Ilardinge reports  on  29th September  that M. Geolfray had recently had anaudience of the King of  Spain who spoke with him. on the subject  of the encourage-ment given in Prance to the revolutionary movement against the  Throne in Spain.The  King mentioned the complicity of M. Breal in this movement and the supply of&quot; French gold&quot;  to  the strikers, but the Ambassador pointed out that the  FrenchGovernment  had given no countenance to the intrigues in question, that  no evidencebad been produced  of any French money being furnished to  the  revolutionaries, andthat  the military Court which had tried. M. Breal had  discharged  him on the  grounds that  the accusations brought against him were unfounded.  The Ambassador declined to accept  the King&apos;s suggestion  that  the Court  had received  orders  to  suppressincriminating evidence against the prisoner in the interests of international friendship.   Lord Bertie learns that  M. Geoff ray, the French Ambassador in  Madrid, has beenrecalled and that he is to  be succeeded by Mr.  Joseph Thierry, a former Minister ofFinance.   The new Belgian Minister, Baron van der Elst, has arrived in Madrid,                                  PORTUGAL.   The President of the Portuguese  Republic,  after visiting certain sectors of the-West Front, arrived in London on 17th October.
                                     CHINA.   The Chinese Prime Minister has advised Sir J. Jordan that over 30,000 chinese troops are to be sent to France.  The United States  have  arranged  to  provide funds for the equipment and despatch of this force, and France will ask the Allied ShippingCommission to furnish the necessary transport.   Sir J. Jordan has been instructed to  report as to what  steps have been taken  toprotect British interests  in the Province of Kwangsi  in view  of the  French claimadvanced recently that France holds exclusive rights to all  mining and railway develop-in ents in that area, which marches  with French Inclo-Ohiiia.   According to a Press  report quoted by Sir J. Jordan, the  Japanese Governmenthave sanctioned the negotiation of  a contract between a  Japanese syndicate and theChinese Government  for the  supply of arms in twelve months&apos; time to the value  ofabout 3,000,000/.                                    JAPAN.   During  his  visit to London  the Prime Minister,  M. Painleve, discussed thepossibility  of  obtaining  Japanese military  assistance.   The  British Ambassador in washington is instructed to ascertain the views of the United States Government onthe question of  the  principle involved,  but  Sir  C.  Spring Pice is  warned that no decision  has as  yet  been arrived  at as to the area where such assistance, should itbe forthcoming,  is to be applied.   Sir C. Greene sends details of the  typhoon  of  1st October, which  is the  worstknown in Japan for half a  century.  A thousand lives are reported lost and 4-5,000houses have been damaged or destroyed,  while 200,000 more have been flooded.   TheBritish  Ambassador  suggests  that  a message  of  sympathy  from His&quot; Majesty&apos;sGovernment would be  much  appreciated.   The  British. Government,  acting upon  the  advice tendered by Sir  C. Greene,have instructed  him to  express their sincere sympathy with the Japanese Govern-ment and people as well  as with the victims of the typhoon.                                     SIAM.   The Foreign Office has directed Sir II. Bering- to reassure the Siamese Governmenton the subject of the proposed deportation of enemy subjects for internment in  India,and quotes the case of a similar procedure  in  Liberia, whence enemy subjects weredeported and interned in France.  Siam is also assured  that  her  declaration of warterminated,  the extra-territorial  privileges  of  Germans  and Austrians, and theirinternment, with or without preliminary deportation, can give rise to no valid proteston the part of either Empire.  Further, the Siamese Government is informed that the belligerent rights acquired by Siam in virtue of her declaration of war over-ride anyobligations to which she may previously have been  pledged hy  Treaty  with eitherenemy State.   In view of this, the British Government hope that Siam  will now beable to co-operate with OJreat Britain  and the United States in the economic  policy adopted against the Scandinavian countries and the Netherlands,  at any rate as far asfoodstuffs, minerals,  rubber, and exotic woods are concerned.                                 ARGENTINE,   The Argentine Government have applied for Count  Luxburg&apos;s safe-conduct  to bemade available for passage by  a Dutch vessel leaving at the beginning of November.The  former  German  Minister  was  brought back from  an  unauthorised journeysouthwards, and is at present interned on an Argentine  island.   Idle celebrations  on Columbus  Day, which were rather dreaded as having been organised by the pro-German party (vide Report  No.  37, p. 1G), passed  off without serious trouble, possibly in virtue of the cooling effect of a fall of rain.
   The British Government has stopped certain proposed shipments of grain direct from the Argentine to Norway, as the latter country will temporarily draw her supplies from the United States in virtue of  the recent blunder of  the Exports Board, but hasbeen obliged to give facilities for the transport of a quantity of oil cake.   In reply to British representations urging the desirability of  opening negotiationsfor the purchase of the Argentine cereal  and fodder crop as soon as possible, Sir C.Spring Rice informs the Foreign Office that the United States are not likely to share in the purchase of the whole available surplus, as the Department of Agriculture andthe United  States  Food  Controller still  think  it will  only be necessary to buy a quantity equivalent to that normally shipped to the Northern neutrals.   ddie British  Ambassador considers that the bunkering regulations promulgatedin connection with  the  Plate trade will be  enforced in  a manner  compatible  with british  and Allied  interests, and asks that west-bound northern neutral ships mayonly be so limited in their bunkering  by  Great  Britain as to enable them  to reach a united States port and no more.                                  URUGUAY.   The British Government has assured the Government of Uruguay of their pleasureat the  rupture  of  relations with Germany and  at  the popular  manifestations of sympathy with the Allies.   The Uruguayan Government repealed  their former  declarations  of neutrality onloth October in favour of all the Allies.  This has been done before the signature ofany Arbitration Treaty,  although last week the  Minister for Foreign  Affairs  had declared that such signature b)&apos; Great Britain, France, and Italy was an indispensiblepreliminary to the revocation of the decrees of neutrality.                                    CHILE.   Sir F. Stronge has been informed by the President of the Republic that after thepayments in Germany for the German-owned nitrate properties  in  Chile  (purchased by the Dupont Powder Company, with  the approval of Great Britain  and the UnitedStates) the Chileati balances in Germany would only just meet  the  coupon payments on German-owned Chilean bonds for the next six months, and that there would be nosurplus available for the purchase of ships.  (Vide Report No. 33, page 16.)   According to a Press report the portfolios in the new- Chilean Cabinet have been allocated as follows ::     Don Eleodoro Yanez -           -   Interior.    Don Edwardo Suarez Mujica     -   Foreign Affairs.    Don Ricardo Salas Edwards     -   Finance.    Don Arturo Alenparte     -      -   Justice.    Don Oscar Viel        -         -   War.    Don Malaquias Concha    -      -   Public Works and Industry.                                     PERU.   The President of the French Republic has sent a personal message of congratulate-lation to the President of Peru on the rupture of Peruvian diplomatic relations  wdthGermany, and Mr. Ronnie  suggests  that a  message of a similar nature from HisMajesty  the  Ring  would have a very good effect, and  help to secure  the  use ofPeruvian wireless stations for  His Majesty&apos;s ships of war.  The  British Governmenthave  intimated  that the  German Minister with his diplomatic staff and GermanConsular officers de carriere may be given a  safe-conduct for return to Germany byway of a contiguous neutral  country,  dhley must travel in a single party and mustproceed by way of Chile and Rio de Janeiro,  dffiey will have to  call at  an approvedBritish port where they wdll be subject to examination and search.   Against  this decision the German diplomatist urges  the  state of his health andasks leave to go via  Panama, whence, he  could take  ship  for Spain or proceed toCuracoa to catch a Dutch steamer.
                                  ECUADOR.   The Ecuadorean Government have based their refusal to receive the former german minister to Peru, who was also accredited to Ecuador, on their recent declaration  ofadhesion to the principle of American  solidarity.   From this it would  appear thata diplomatic rupture lias in  fact&apos; taken place between  Ecuador and the german empire (vide Report No. -33, page 17).                                   MEXICO.   The Foreign Office  has  communicated certain  information  concerning Mexicandesigns against the United States to the American  Ambassador  in London, and hasadvised Sir 0. Spring Pice that in view of the effect  this may have on the attitude ofthe United  States towards  the  present  regime  in Mexico, recognition of GeneralCarranza  is  being  deferred.  The  information  has not been communicated  to  theFrench, but the French Government have been asked to  defer their recognition for thetime being.   Meanwhile Mr.  Cummins  announces  that  revolutionary  manifestos have beenplacarded over Mexico City, torn down  by the authorities, and again posted up, andthat  Congress is discussing the question of declaring martial  law as Government,troops are reported to have been defeated by revolutionaries in small engagements.   The d^arnpico strike has come to an end.                                     CUBA.   Mr. Leech reports that a semi-official notice in the local Press to the effect that  theSpanish Minister in Havana is a persona grata, has put an end to the rumours that  the cuban Government intended to ask for his recall in connection with the Paul Burgercase  (vide Report No. 36, page Id).                              UNITED STATES.   Sir C. Spring Rice  reports that President Wilson  signed  the  Trading with  theEnemy Bill on 6th October.  Amendments have strengthened  the Presidents handsby giving him powers, enforced by heavy penalties,  to  establish  censorship over all communications passing between  the  United States and any foreign country.   an executive Order issued on  15th October under  the Prevention of  Espionage and  the trading  with the Enemy  Acts  provides  for  the  establishment of  a War JdadeBoard,  which  absorbs  the  former  Exports  Board  and is  strengthened  by  theaddition  of  members  representing  the   Treasury   and  the   Shipping  Board.The  new Board,  in  addition,  to  the  functions  of the  old  Exports Board,  willcontrol restricted imports and regulate  trade with enemies and allies of enemies,  andof enemy, or  ally of enemy, persons or firms in the  United States other than insurance companies.   It will also license changes of name by enemy subjects  or their allies.The  Exports Council becomes  the War Trade Council, and the Secretary  of  theTreasury and the Chairman of the Shipping Board,  become additional, members.   TheSecretary of the Treasury is empowered to regulate exchange and the export of bullionand control enemy insurance  companies.   The  Censorship Board will control outwardand inward communications of all sorts.  The Federal Trade Commission receivesadditional powers for the regulation and control  of patents,  ddie Postmaster-General isgiven control over newspapers published in foreign  languages, and a  Custodian is appointed to  receive monies due to or held for the benefit of an enemy subject  or  hisally.   Sir H. Rumbold learns  that President Wilsoids remark on the  subject of possible future commercial restrictions against Germany have caused much concern among the classes likely to be affected in Germany.   Count Horodyski, a prominent pro-Ally Pole, telegraphing to Sir E. Drummond,describes pro-war enthusiasm as  growing in  the West.  The  East, however^ is much,      4073-3                              E
plagued by pacifists who gossip pessimistically.  He draws attention  to the  constantbelittling  of  British  efforts by the  French representatives in the United States andurges the  British Government not to allow France to run everything.  Jewish influenceis on the whole pacifist.                            SHIPPING SITUATION.   According to the War  Trade Intelligence Report, the total tonnage  of  500 tonsgross in the case of steamers and 100 tons gross in the case.of sailing  ships reported lost  owing to the malice of the  lving&apos;s  enemies during the period  5th October to11th October inclusive is 73,250 tons, of which 45,541 tons were British, as  comparedwith 60,471 tons, of  which 44,180 tons were British, reported last week.   According to the figures supplied by the Admiralty and  the  Shipping controller the British losses by enemy action (including 20 per cent, of ships damaged but  notsunk winch have to. be laid  up for repairs) for the third quarter of 1917 amount to892,881 tons, against which 242,773 tons  of new  construction must be reckoned as having passed into service under the British flag.  This shows a  net loss of 650,108tons,   if the  total losses be counted due to enemy action, marine risks, transfer orsale to a foreign Hag, or other  causes, the amount  is 927,903 tons but this does  not include ships  laid up for repair owing to the attacks of submarines.  The total gains,allowing for  transfers and purchase from foreign  flags and  other causes, amount to497,861 tons, so that the net loss for the quarter to shipping under the Red  Ensign is430,042 tons.   It  is difficult from  these  figures to  strike an exact balance for  theamount of shipping which from one cause or another has ceased  to be  available foruse at sea  under the British flag, but in any case it appears to be very considerably less than the Admiralty forecast of probable losses for the quarter, which was 744,000tons.   In  view of the reported  activity on the part  of the  Germans to  secure neutral tonnage for their own use after the  war, the British. Government have  proposed jointAllied action in this matter.   The business of  chartering neutral tonnage after  thewar would  be undertaken  solely by the inter-Ailied Chartering Committee,  with suchalterations  in its powers and modifications in the present financial arrangements  thatmay be necessary.   These proposals have been made to. France and Italy with a viewto securing their co-operation in joint representations  to  the  United States, and  theBritish diplomatic representatives at  the Courts of the  maritime European neutralshave been instructed to advise on the best methods for applying persuasion or pressure to achieve the desired results.   In the  hope of securing  Allied recognition  of their  position with  regard to ex-enemy ships, the  Brazilian Government have officially intimated their  intention toform an international service with these vessels for the benefit of Brazilian and Alliedinterests.   Sir A.  Peel wishes to know whether he may assure the Brazilian Govern-nient that  no stipulations will be made as to the nationality of ships bringing coffeeto the United Kingdom.   In any case the British Government have decided not to interfere with the  presentvoyage of  the ox-German &quot;Gertrude Wizemann,&quot; now  flying tho  Brazilian  flag asthe &quot; Curvelle,&quot; but do not  as yet  consider that this forbearance forms a  precedent for future treatment of Brazilian ex-enemy ships.    According to advices from Mr. Cummins, I he United  States Ambassador in  Mexicois anxious  that, such forbearance should not  be practised in the case of the &quot; Antonina &quot;at Tampico, which the Mexican Government proposes to  purchase.    Mr. Rennie reports that  the ex-German ships  in Peruvian ports have  been  verysqriously damaged, so much so, indeed, that repairs  cannot be  executed locally,  andthe Peruvian Government are ready to hand over all  except one to the Allies in returnfor three or four seaworthy ships of smaller tonnage.    Mr. Haggard learns in La Paz (Bolivia) that local Germans  assert that Chile islikely to claim possession  of  the Peruvian. ex-German ships as having  been acquired by her in virtue of an arrangement with Germany.    The President of the Chilean. Republic has advised Sir F. Stronge that owing to lack of funds deposited in Germany (vide Chile) lie did not propose  to  buy the three german ships  in Chilean ports, but  only to charter them  for  use in the Americantrade under the Chilean flags.
    Mr. Erskine reports that the Italian Minister for Foreign Affairs prefers that italy should forego any share in the proposed Inter-Allied allocation of Uruguayan ex-euem.ships rather  than submit to the demands of the Uruguayan Government.  In  consequence  of  this  the Foreign  Oifics  has advised  Sir C.  Spring Rice  that  GreatBritain is  prepared to divide  the Uruguayan ex-enemy tonnage, which is  to be-chartered and not sold, in the proportions of one-third apiece to  France, the UnitedStates and Great  Britain.    In view of the declaration  of  the  Siamese Government  that in chartering theirex-enemy ships they are influenced, chiefly by a desire to relieve the war  situation inEurope, Sir Id. Bering has urged  the  Japanese Minister in Bangkok to represent tohis Government the desirability of coming  into line with the other Allies  as to the-employment of the proposed Japanese  share of these ships for the general interests ofall  the Allies, and not for purely Japanese purposes.    In answer  to  the  British request  for second-hand guns  to be  used  for  armingmerchantmen (vide Report  No. 3G, page  16) the Japanese Admiralty  has offered tosupply at the usual price twenty 6-inch, twelve 4&quot; 7-inch, and eight 3-inch guns.    dire Chinese Government, which is much embarrassed by the fact that those ships-of the Chinese Navy wdiich are  at Canton have not  yet returned to their  allegiance to the authority of the Peking Government, have only been able to offer four 4&quot; 7 inch guns from the Shanghai Arsenal in reply to the request of the British Admiralty.                            PEACE DISCUSSIONS.    Sir W. Townley was informed  by the Dutch Minister for Foreign Affairs that Herrvon Kuhlmann, in conversation with  the Netherlands Minister in Berlin, had  saidthat  while Germany could not tell Great  Britain  through a neutral that she was prepared  to evacuate Belgium unconditionally, she would make that answer direct to;an  Englishman empowered to ask the  question.    At the peace  demonstration  made in Vienna  on 7th October  by the  ChristianSocialist Party, Prince Lichteustein opened the meeting with a speech in wdiich hesaid the  Party desired peace by agreement, and, if possible, a general disarmament and  the  establishment  of  a permanent  Court of  Arbitration.   It also desired anhonourable  peace,  which  would lastingly protect  Austria-Hungary  against   thefrivolous  attacks  of wicked neighbours.   Herr  Kunschak,  a member of  the LandCommittee, was loudly applauded when he referred to the ardent desire for peace whichwas making itself felt in ail  belligerent and neutral European countries, and  wrasprogressing in spite of the efforts of   Governments  and mercenary journalists.   TheParty had gathered to applaud the Pope&apos;s efforts for a peace based on the elimination of force of arms and the substitution of moral right and international law as the forcescontrolling the new order of affairs in  the world.    Count  Julius  Andrassy has published  an  article  deriding the idea of a peace without  annexations or indemnities,  and maintaining that Poland must enter  theHabsburg Monarchy.   He considers that  any attempt to reconstitute Serbia or to oustBulgaria from Macedonia would only be the prelude to another war.    The &quot; Humanite &quot; welcomes Herr von  Ivuhlmamds uncompromising declaration asto the inevitable retention of Alsace-Lorraine  by Germany as having cleared the issue and shown up the insinceritjr of previous  German proposals, of holding a plebiscite inthe Provinces.   The  Central  Empires  must be  utterly defeated or France mustabandon all. hope of recovering Alsace-Lorraine wdth Peace.    Sir W. Townley, in conversation on 27th September with M. do Sincay, a manu-facturer who has come out of Belgium with the permission of the Germans, apparently inconnection with possible future peace overtures, was informed that the Emperor Williamis most anxious to find a way of making peace.   M. cle Sincay considers that the Papalpeace proposals were drafted in Berlin and imposed upon the Pope by means of pressureexercised  through Vienna  as a means of enabling the Emperor to put forward newpeace proposals  without incurring the odium  of his own Germans by so doing overhis own name.  The emperor&apos;s desire for peace is reported to be opposed both by theEmpress and by  the Crown Prince.    Sir H. Rumbold reports that the International Peace Conference in Berne has  hadto  be postponed as only five  Allied delegates have  appeared to meet  Dr.  Erzbergerand. 6.4 other representatives of the enemy empires.    According to  a German  Press  report,  Dr. Erzberger has  succeeded in getting intouch with British peace&quot; agents.     4073 -                              F
                                   GENERAL.   The Austro-PIungarian Foreign  Office has &quot;suggested that the Swiss Governmentshould  bring  about a  meeting  between  Austro-Hungarian,  French,  and  Italiandelegates to discuss the question of an exchange  of unwounded-prisoners of war.  ddieItalian  Government urged France  to  refuse  to send  delegates,  but M. Ribot was unwilling to comply with their request  owing to  the state of public opinion in France.He was, however, prepared to instruct the Freuch-delegates to wreck the negotiations.Great Britain is supporting the further Italian representations on. this subject, andLord Bertie has been instructed to point out  that such  proposals are only calculated to prolong the war, and should not even be discussed in view of the effect they cannotfail  to  produce  on the Russian  and  Serbian Governments (vide Reports No. 33,page 20, and No. 34, page 15).  The Anglo-German arrangement for the internmentin neutral countries of officers and non-commissioned officers who have  been eighteen months in  captivity does not affect the present proposals which are for  the exchangeof unwounded combatants.  In spite of the action of Great Gritain and Italy,&apos;M. Ribotconsiders that the  scheme must be prosecuted, but guarantees  that no convention shall be signed.   Sir M. Findlay  learns that,  the  Germans  are trying to arrange  an exchange ofunwounded prisoners of war with R-ussia with the express object of  increasing theirman power in the field (vide Report No. 33, page 21).   As arrangements have been made for the  exchange of a number of Russian and enemy prisoners of war through Sweden, Sir M.  Findlay is informed that the SwedishRailway Administration has demanded 191  tons  of  coal and  a  large quantity oflubricants  as the price of facilitating this transaction.   Sir. W. Townley reports that by exercise of continued pressure he has induced theNetherlands Government to collect military doctors for the inspection of prisoners inGreat Britain and Germany.   In order to facilitate his efforts in getting the necessarydoctors sent to Germany, the British Minister is anxious that  those  detailed  for theBritish inspections  should be brought to this  country at once.   Sir  W.  d.ownley reports, on the authority of  Dr. Snouck Hurgronje, who  is atHanover, that all British, officers who were prisoners at Schwarmsteclt have now beentransferred to the new camp at Holzminden (vide Reports, No. 34,  page 15, and No. 35,,page IS).   The Dutch. Minister  in Berlin reports  that.  05  British officers of  the  merchant service were  transferred,  from, the  prisoners&apos; camp  at Brandenburg  on. 3rd October,11 more on 14th and loth October,  and that the remaining 78, who have been unableto produce documentary evidence as to their rank, will be  transferred  to an  officers&apos;camp  as  soon as possible on their giving an undertaking to obtain a Board of Tradecertificate of rank within a month of their transfer.   Idie Dutch Inspecting Doctor Romer reports that  no  improvements have  been effected in the prisoners&apos; camp at Ronneburg since the date of the last inspection.All  British prisoners have, however, been transferred elsewhere.   The  conditions at.Stroehen Camp have improved since the departure of the former Commandant.    In view  of the conclusion of an Agreement between Germany and Sweden (vide-Sweden), whereby the  former undertakes to  supply  the  latter  with  foodstuffs, theAmerican Minister in  Copenhagen has  suggested,  to  his Government  that the allies should  immediately demand that prisoners of war in Germany should  now be properlyfed,  otherwise German prisoners of war will be put on rations  similar to those issued to Allied prisoners in Germany.  He urges that everything should be done  to stir updiscontent against  the German Government in Germany for exporting food  instead  ofincreasing the popular rations.    The Netherlands Government has  advised Sir W. Townley that Germany, after  a last  effort to resuscitate  the . South wold Bay proposal, has now definitely agreed thatBoston should be used as the port of. transhipment for  returned prisoners.    T&quot;he Dutch Consul at Aleppo reports that the British prisoners of war working on the Baghdad  Railway continue to ask for more food than they are getting.  he suggests that  T 15,000 monthly would&apos;be necessary for providing for their immediateneeds,  and  points out  that  the prisoners prefer to   be supplied  with actual foodrather than with paper money.     The Papal Agent in Berne  has applied for permission to export two truck loads of Swiss condensed milk which are to form  part -of  a gift to be  sent by the Pope to italian prisoners of war in Austria.  Sir II. Rnmbold  suggests that  the Papal Agent,
who has been advised to send this consignment through a Committee approved by theBritish Government, should be allowed.-to forward half a truck load while awaiting the Vatican !s approval of  this course,   ddie Foreign Office, however,dn view of theabsence of satisfactory guarantees that the milk in question will ever reach the italian prisoners  is not inclined to agree to  the  proposal,   ddie French and Italian Govern-merits are also being consulted.    The Russian Government  have notified Sir G.  Buchanan  of  their  intention toaccept the  Danish invitation for the Red Cross Conference  in Copenhagen,  where theRussians will meet  enemy delegates.   The  proposals  to be  discussed  refer only tothe exchange of wounded prisoners  of  Avar which, if agreed  to, will be effectedexclusively by  way  of  Sweden.   According to  the  German wireless  report theConference began  its  sittings  on 17th October when  delegates  from  the  followingcountries  were  present: Germany,  Austria-Hungary, Turkey among  the CentralEmpires, Denmark and Sweden among the Neutrals, and. Russia and Rumania amongthe Allies.    Sir G. Buchanan has been advised that the United States Government has delinedthe invitation to be represented at the Copenhagen Red Cross Conference (vide ReportsNo. 35, page 18, and No. 37, page 20).    Reports have reached  this country that typhus has broken out among prisoners ofwar waiting at Constance for transfer to Switzerland or  repatriation, but the Swissauthorities are not disposed to put much faith, in the reports.    ddie Hellenic Government  has been warned of the  outbreak  of an epidemic ofcholera in  Asia Minor, and has invited the co-operation of the Allies with the localauthorities in order to isolate the  iEgean Islands from possible infection.    Sir C. Spring Rice reports  that the Secretary, of  State wishes to  know whether his Majesty&apos;s Government approve of Mr. T. P. 0&apos;Connor&apos;s  proposal  that the 69thNew York  Regiment should be landed at Queenstown en route for France  and taken on a  short tour  in the neighbourhood as was done in the  case of the Irish CanadianRegiment.   Mr. T. P.  0&apos;Connor,  M.P., considers that wholesale and  happy influenceswould in this way be exerted both in Ireland and in England.
