SECRET.APPRECIATION  OF  THE  ATTACH ED  WESTERN  AND GENERAL                           REPORT,  No.  29.                            INTER-IMPERIAL EXCHANGE.   There can. be no  doubt now that, in the absence of  any system of inter-Imperialexchange, we shall be compelled in a few weeks to cut down our orders of food and munitions in Canada,  and  reduce  the productive  capacity of the  Empire, in order toincrease  our  indebtedness to the United States.  The suggestion, on the part of  theIndian Government, that  it might secure gold for itself by floating an independentIndian loan, in America, and the telegram to Mauritius asking lor a local loan to coverour  sugar purchases  in  the island, help  to illustrate  the problems which willaccumulate with increasing rapidity and seriousness if the question of inter-Imperialexchange is not properly faced.                            TIGHTENING TUFO  BLOCKADE.   The  suggestions  of the British Government with regard, to a  financial blockade(see  &quot; Allied  Common Affairs &quot;), and  the proposals.for the  tightening of the generalblockade by the  United States (see  wider   United States &quot;) ought to furnish not onlya  most  effective weapon  during  the war.  but a powerful,  lever  during  the peacenegotiations,  and a means  of keeping a measure of control over Germany during the transition period.   Meanwhile, the  enemy  Powers  are busy  putting their  headstogether (see  &quot; Enemy Allied Affairs&quot;) to be in a position to present a united front oneconomic questions at the Peace Conference.                                    PANAMA.   The attitude of the United States with regard to Canal facilities is tiresome andincomprehensible.                                  UNITED STATES.    Sir 0. Spring Rice&apos;s warnings  as to the  possibility&quot; of  President Wilson coming forward with serious  peace proposals of his  own, if he finds  the war too unpopular inthe  United  States, should be  kept  in  mind  throughout while  reading the long dis-cussions on the financial and blockade questions.   The more  we can, on the one hand,keep  independent of the United States by  drawing our supplies from  within  theEmpire,  and  cutting down  our  consumption, and, on  the  other  hand, educate  thePresident and the American  public to our point of view  as  regards peace terms, thegreater the chance of a satisfactory peace.   Of these two methods of securing a goodpeace the second is largely speculative ; the  only certain method  is to develop andhusband our own resources, buying nothing  from  the  United States  which we canpossibly produce in the British Empire, or by  rigid economy  do without.
   The question of the military service obligation on British subjects  in the UnitedStates is one of great importance.   The natural and obvious thing is that they shouldhave the option of  joining the nearest British force, i.c, the Canadian Army, or elseof being drafted into the American Army.                               PEACE DISCUSSIONS.   The Pope&apos;s proposals arc, in themselves, nebulous  and  impracticable.  They aredangerous,  because  they strengthen the idea, which the Germans  have been working at hard ever since the end of  last 3-ear, of  an early peace.   Such a peace can only  be one on the basis of the present &quot; war map,&quot; and it is no  use for the Aflies to talk  ofpeace  till they have changed  that map, or till Germany or one  of  her  Allies  collapsesfrom over-strain.  &apos;                                                        ...   The same applies l.o-t.he Stockholm Conference, which has  this added danger forthe  future,  that  it  represents a  deliberate  attempt   to  break  down  the  nationalorganisation of States in  favour  of an  international  organisation of  the  Socialistparlies.  If  this could  really  succeed, and the4 &quot; Super-State &quot; come about by thismeans, there might be something to be said, for it.  But the only  result that. Socialistinternationalism  can possibly achieve, in  practice, is to  prevent  the  less effectivelyorganised communities, like the British. Umpire, from organising themselves for their future  security,  without in  any way affecting the  policj- of  a highly organised andintensely nationalist community like Germany.    Meanwhile, the  decision  of the Western Allied  Governments  not  to grant pass-ports  is only  the beginning  in  each  country  of an  internal conflict  which, willrequire handling with both tact and firmness.                            &apos;..  .

PART  I.-BRITISH  EMPIRE  AND  AFRICA.                                    CANADA.    With  reference to the telegram of 6th August  from the Canadian Government (see Report No. 28), the  Colonial  Office on  9th August pointed, out that the British. Government was doing its best to curtail Canadian commitments  as drastically as it could, and hoped  that, while an advance  out  of the October instalment might be necessary  in  September, it might be possible  to  get clear in October.  The latest information was that  further dollars would not be forthcoming from  the United States Treasury for the  purpose of  remittance to  Canada, in  spite of  all possible pressure brought  to  bear  upon  the   American Government  for  this  purpose.  Under  the circumstances, the British Government did  not  see any alternative  to the proposals made by it on 1st August, and again urged  Sir T. White to help by anticipating by a few weeks the advances  which he had promised  to make in any  case.    in a  telegram of  10th  August from  Sir  PI.  Lever  to  the  Chancellor of  the Exchequer, the former, after having seen Sir T.  White on the 8th,  expressed the view that he  would, accept the British Governments proposal  if  pressed, but  suggested that it might  be useful to  offer some slight solatium, such as  an offer to meet  the Bank of Commerce loan  of $5,000,000 in September, if Sir T. White met this month&apos;s Bank of  Montreal  loan.  This, he thought, could  be done  out  of the balance  in New York.  Sir T. White was evidently under  the impression  that the $15,000,000 a month  from monies received from  the  United States Treasury was less than  we could afford for Canada.&quot; The fear of  the bad political effect of a serious  reduction of the Canadian munition output had no doubt also weighed with him.  On the 13th Sir H. Lever telegraphed that unless the  Treasury could furnish  additional financial support it was urgent that the Imperial Munitions Board should be  definitely ordered to reduce its programme so as to adjust  it to the available finance,  viz., $25,000,000.a month, from the Canadian Ministry of Finance and  $15,000,000 from the Treasury account in New York.    On  10th August  Sir H.  Lever telegraphed  to the Chancellor of  the  Exchequer that the  Canadian loan issue of $100,000,000 having failed  (it would appear that between  75  and 85  millions  of  the loan  were taken up hy the public), as it was undesirable that any  public admission of failure  should  be made, he  had arranged with Sir T. White on the 8th that the British Treasury should take up $25,000,000 of the loan, participating in the underwriting syndicate at  the price of 96^-.  Of this $25,000,000, a total  of $10,000,000 will  share pro rata in  any  sales Vnich  the syndicate  may be  able  to effect.  Any  balance of the $ 10,000,000  as well as  the remaining $15,000,000 are only to be disposed of after the syndicate has closed.   The Treasury has  arjproved Sir EL LeveFs action.    The Pacific Cable Board and  British Post Office have received an  offer from  the Canadian Pacific Railway to  lease a wire from Halifax to Montreal for 15 years.   The wire could either be across  Maine, in which case its  length would be  760 miles, or keep entirely in British territory, which would  involve  a  total  length of  900 miles, and the Company &apos;.vishes to  know which route would be preferred.   The  wire is to be  used  to  carry all  classes  of Australasian traffic  and. Government  of  Canada traffic.    The Winnipeg Liberal Convention at its final  session passed a resolution expressing its  admiration of Sir W. Laurier, and its  &quot; hope that his undoubted  ability, long. &quot; experience, and. matchless statesmanship may be utilised in  recruiting the people &quot;of Canada  in this  great crisis in the successful&apos;prosecution  of the war and  in.&apos;&quot; carrying  out the platform laid down by the Convention.&quot;  An uncompromising resolution denouncing the whole  conduct of the  war under Sir R.  Borden was  also adopted on the motion of Mr. A. L. S if ton, Premier of Alberta, who had been expected to support a  Union Government. Coupled, with  the  absence of  any really definite pronouncement for conscription this, at first, looked as if  the Western Liberal revolt-against Sir W. Laurier had^been  effectively  quelled.  Since the meeting  there appears
to have been a certain reaction.  The Winnipeg &quot;Free Press &quot; and  &quot; Tribune &quot; bothdenounce the suggestion that Sir W. Laurier could lead Western Canadian Liberalism.The Executive of the Great War Veterans Association denounced  the resolution as aninsult to Western  Canadians  by  &quot;party  politicians  and  traitors.&quot;  Mr.  Hudson,Attorney-General  of Manitoba, and chairman of  the Resolutions Committee of the-Convention, has issued a statement  explaining  that  the resolution  of admiration for sir W. Laurier commits no one to his leadership.    The  &quot;omnibus&quot;  resolution  on the  war passed by  the  Convention was  asfollows :     &quot; In this  war of democratic civilisation  against military despotism the conditions-       call for the putting  forth by each. Allied belligerent of its full power as the       only assurance of victory.    &quot; The  entire  resources  of  the  country moral  and  material,  man power  and       wealth are justly disposable by the State in times  of peril for the preservation       of its national liberties.    &quot; The imperative duty  of the people of  Canada to-day in regard to the war is its       continued and vigorous prosecution : -           &quot; First, by  conferring  with the British Government  for the purpose  of       definitely ascertaining the Bcope and character of  the assistance that can best.       be given by Canada ;           &quot; Second, by the  maintenance  in unimpaired strength at the Front of our       fighting forces,  and  the taking of  all steps  necessary to secure the required       reinforcements for the Canadian contingent ;           &quot;Third, by organising the production  of  other contributions  to  the war,       such as food, munitions and other war necessities upon the lines of the greatest       efficiency;           &quot; Fourth, by the complete extinction of  profiteering  in all business having       to  do.  with  munitions and.  the  necessities  of  life,  if necessary, by the       nationalisation of these industries, or by the  adaptation of the British system       of control;           &quot; Fifth, by the recovery for the Public Treasury  for the present requirements   ,       of the State of undue profits obtained  since the beginning of the war by the       exploitation of the people ;           &quot; Sixth, by the application of a combined system of sharply graded taxation       upon incomes and  excess profits,  which shall ensure that every citizen shall       bear his or her full share of war burdens, according to his or  her means ;           &quot; Seventh, by the thorough organisation of the nation, and carrying out of       this programme by whatever means be necessary for its accomplishment.&quot;    There were other resolutions in favour of an increase  in the British preference to-50 per cent, with a view  to ultimate free  trade between Canada and Great Britain,in favour of  extending  the Dominion franchise to women,  and  for the publicity of campaign fund contributions.    A Bill was introduced  into the  Canadian  House  of/ Commons on 13th August bythe Minister of Justice, Mr. Doherty, making provision ifor Canadian soldiers overseasto vote at the forthcoming elections.  All soldiers will.be entitled to vote, and. the term will include  not only minors, but also nurses and Canadian Indians, i.e., classeswho  would not have the franchise in Canada itself.                     &apos;  AUSTRALIAN  COMMONWEALTH.                                      *   At a meeting of the Ministerial party last week the immediate taking of a second.referendum on conscription was strongly urged by Sir W. Irvine and  other members,but  the meeting as a whole was opposed  to any departure from the present j)policy of concentrating effort on voluntarism.   In answer to a deputation from  the Chamber  ofAgriculture which had urged  the necessitj&apos;- of National Service, Mr. Hughes repliedthat no logical objection could  be raised against this proposal, but his election pledgewas  against the introduction of conscription until  circumstances  arose  justifying the variation.   A Bill giving returned  soldiers and  sailors  special facilities  for entering  the-Commonwealth public service has passed the House of Representatives.
   The Senate has passed a motion in favour of the appointment of an Australianofficial representative to the  United States.   In his Budget speech on  8th August Sir J. Forrest  estimated the revenue for thepresent financial  year  as  35,1.81,6557.   Adding last year&apos;s surplus the amount avail-able to meet expenditure will be 37,283,832/,., of which 13,10,9,351/. will  be  available from revenue for  war services.  The total war expenditure from revenue  and loan inthe past year was  61,506,81.11.;  for this year it is  estimated at  97,160,581/.!  Thismeans the necessity for raising 64,065,922/,. by loan this year, and every effort will bemade to raise this money in  Australia.   The  total public  debt of the Commonwealthon 30th June last was 169,177,767/., of which 127,964,989/. was war loan.   The new taxation, proposals of the Government are a wartime profits tax, estimated to produce one-million for  the two years 1915-17, and  an additional income tax of10 per cent, with a 10/. minimum, on all single men and childless widowers between21  and  45  years who have not  enlisted.   This  last tax is estimated to produce500,000/., and its proceeds are to be used for  repatriation purposes.   The Governor of Victoria  is informed by the Premier that  a  resolution will hemoved in the Legislative Assembly on  16th August proposing that the post of StateGovernor be abolished.   The  Government,  while  in  sympathy with the  proposal,recognises that for a change of this kind to  be effective it  must  be  introduced and accepted,  by  all States, and  that  it is only one  of  several important constitutional changes that are likely to be adopted after the. war.  For this reason, the Governmentwill move as an amendment to  the resolution that the future constitution of AustralianStates be referred to a  Conference  of Premiers.   Mr. Holm an, Premier of  New South Wales, was received on the 11th at Havre bythe  King of the Belgians,  and on this occasion  handed  to Queen  Elizabeth twocheques totalling 59,292/.,  bringing the total subscribed by New South  Wales forBelgian War victims to 720,000/!                                NEW ZEALAND.   The, Dominion  Government have  gratefully  accepted  the British  Governmentsoffer of His Majesty&apos;s  ship &quot;Torch,&quot; which will  be re-christened &quot;Rama,&quot; the Maoriequivalent of her present name.                               SOUTH AFRICA.   The result of the Wool Conference held on 27th July was a resolution empowering the Union Government to make the best  terms possible in the interests of the Colony,but there was a strong feeling that a slightly increased price should be offered for thenew clips.  Before discussing this  matter  in detail, however, the Governor-general has requested to be informed of the policy and position  of His  Majesty&apos;s government as regards  the  present brisk competition  of  Japanese and American buyers forforward  delivery.  The Japanese  demand is  particularly keen one  agent alone  isprepared to take 116,000 bales.  Price is apparently no object, and it is evident  that japanese purchases are not being  limited to the country&apos;s power of consumption.Americans are also offering to buy the new  clips for forward delivery.   Under thesecircumstances, it is not  easy for the  Union Government to give effect to the wishes  ofthe War Office by  prohibiting the export of wool to destinations other than the UnitedKingdom.   The Japanese are in  a  position to  provide freight for what they buy  intheir steamships, which now call  regularly at Union ports.   Wool producers, seeingthem, prepared to give high  prices and. able to handle the goods, are  not likely  toagree  to an arrangement  which  would bind  them to  sell only  to His  Majesty&apos;sGovernment.   The Shipping  Controller has asked for  the appointment at Cape Town  of a localcommittee to decide from which shippers homeward  cargo authorised by the ministry is to be  drawn, and the South African  Conference Committee have, with his approval,telegraphed to their Cape Town  representative suggesting  a list of names nominated by the different lines to serve on the Committee.  The Union Government will alsobe asked to nominate a  representative to attend the meetings.     3657- -3                             B
                                  MAURITIUS.   The Colonial Office has suggested to  the Governor of Mauritius the desirability of opening, and keeping  open for, say, six months,  a further guaranteed local loan inorder to assist in coping with present and prospective difficulties of exchange.  Bondsto be redeemable in five years;  Proceeds  to  be held in the Colony and ultimately tobe used in paying for sugar.                        PORTUGUESE EAST AFRICA.   The Governor-General of Portuguese East Africa has informed  the Union Govern-ment that the export of maize, except to Portugal, has been strictly prohibited by thePortuguese  Government.   It will  therefore be necessary for the wheat Commissionto proceed  through diplomatic channels  to obtain permission for the  export of themaize which it  has purchased at Beira.                                WEST INDIES.   The Army Council now proposes to suspend the recruiting of West  Indians for duty in France till next spring, when the question will be reconsidered.  The ColonialOffice has accordingly telegraphed to ascertain what numbers are at present awaitingembarkation  and in training   The question of drafts  for the  maintenance of the battalion in Eg3rpt is not yet settled.                                    MALTA.   It is not yet certain whether the agreement about  to be concluded between GreatBritain and France on the subject of military service obligations to be reciprocallyimposed, will apply to Algeria.  His Majesty&apos;s representative at Algiers has, however,been  informed that,  if and when it does, Maltese British  subjects  wdio  may  elect,tinder the agreement, to serve in the British Army, must return to Great Britain andnot to Malta.  As  most of  these Maltese are probably unable to speak English, it  ishoped that they will elect to serve  in the French Army.                                    CYPRUS.   In answer to a suggestion from  the General  Officer Commanding in Egypt  thatCyprus should be included  in his command in the interests of uniform control  andco-ordination,  more  particularly in  order  to  deal  with local  espionage, the  HighCommissioner,  Sir E.  Clausen,  replied on 11th August that  such a change would impair  his  ordinary and  martial law responsibility,  would create grave  political difficulties, and would  be disadvantageous  even from the military point of  view, as itwould involve  subordinating the existing English port and military police  officers,who understand local conditions, to Army officers not under the  High Commissioner&apos;?orders.   There have been, minor differences of point of view, more particularly  overa suggestion made by  the intelligence officer in Egypt who  corresponds with Cyprusthat  no Moslem  Cypriotes should  be  allowed, to work  on ships or boats, which sir E.  Clan son,  on naval  advice, rejected as a groundless provocation of  the  boatcaptains and a political blunder. The High Commissioner  suggests  that a generalstaff  officer might  be appointed to reside  in Cyprus and   keep  in  close touch.with him.
PART II-FOREIGN AFFAIRS.                         ALLIED  COMMON AFFAIRS.    A. telegram was sent on 11th August to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassadors in Paris. rome and Washington,  declaring  that  His  Majesty&apos;s Government are of opinion that thetime has come for the Allies to bring pressure to bear on neutral banks to discouragethem from rendering financial services  to the enemy.  The telegram suggests  that  a notice should be issued in the Press  of the various European neutral countries to theeffect that the Governments of Great Britain, France, Italy, Russia and the  UnitedStates have decided that it may become inexpedient for any banking house in thesecountries to continue to do business with any banking house in the neutral country inquestion which grants or increases loans or overdrafts to an enemy Government, orenemy company wheresoever domiciled, or  subscribes to or  purchases  a loan  issuedby an enemy of the Allies, or purchases or deals, on behalf of an enemy, in any  public or  private  bond  or certificate or dividend warrant or note, bill,  cheque  or draftpayable in an Allied country, or transmits any document or  message relating  to anyof the above transactions.  The Allied  Governments concerned, therefore, hold theui-selves free to instruct their subjects to discontinue all intercourse, direct or indirect,with  any  banking  house which  has  not  by a certain date notified  the  Secretary,Bankers&apos;  Clearing House,  Lombard  Street,  E.C.  3,  of  its  intention  to abstaincompletely from participation in any  such transactions.   The  telegram  points  outthat the suggested notice  would  still leave  it open to the Allies to decide whetherthey should carry out the threat contained in the notice against all banks which have failed to notify or only against such as  are known to have  rendered  special assistanceto the enemy^.    On 7th August the Italian Embassy in London returned to the charge with  regardto the location of the Allied Silk Bureau, urging that all the financial and  economic considerations indicated Milan and not Lyons as the appropriate headquarters  for the bureau.   Lord Bertie was asked on the 10th to suggest to the French Government thedesirability of finding some  compromise, and replied  on the  11th that the  italian ambassador at Paris  is to receive  instructions from  Pome to formulate  a proposal and that the two Governments primarily concerned might discuss the matter for  afew days before we intervened with any proposal of our own for a compromise.                                    FRANCE.    The post of Minister of Marine  left vacant by Admiral Lacaze&apos;s resignation wasfilled on 10th August by the appointment of M. Charles Chaumet.  At the same timeM. Jacques Dumesnil was  appointed to the new post of Under Secretary for Marine.M. Chaumet is a Moderate Radical who was Under Secretary of Posts and Telegraphsin  the  Monis, Caillaux, Poiticare  and  Briand Cabinets,  and has, since 1915, beenPresident  of the  Navy Commission of  the  Chamber.   M. Dumesnil is a Radical-Socialist and &quot;friendly to M. Malvy.  It is suggested that his appointment wras madefor political motives to conciliate advanced supporters of the Government who mightbe displeased by M. ChaumePs appointment.    On 12th  August Mr. Hoover urged that in view of the impossibility  of  buyingwheat at  the moment the French Government should cede to the Relief commission for Northern France  part  of the wheat held for them  in America by  the  wheat.Export Company.   The British Government concurs  in the suggestion.                                     ITALY.   A telegram was sent to Sir C. Spring Rice on 11th August pointing out that theItalian oranges  and lemons  of  the 1917-18 crop  will be  free to pass to the enemy
through Switzerland unless the Italian Government can he induced to stop this trafficby  an arrangement which would compensate Italian interests.   The British Govern-ment are considering a scheme for buying up the whole exportable surplus of oranges,about  95,000  tons, and 80,000  tons of lemons, selling  the  oranges in Allied and neutral countries (the latter on a ration basis) or to the War Office, and convertingthe lemons-into citrate of lime to  be stored in Italy till after the war.  The businessarrangements  would be in the hands  of Mr. Dcttridge, head of a large firm of Londonfruit brokers.   The total liability is estimated at about 2,000,000?..   The Governmentanticipate that most of this&quot; will be covered by sales.  But they are anxious  to knowif the American Government will join with the British and French Governments, or ifthe French are unwilling, with the British Government, in  bearing any possible loss,in view of the great importance  of depriving the enemy of a source of supply thatmay be vital to him both as a substitute for fats and as an anti-scorbutic.                                   BELGIUM.    In order to meet  the  urgent requirements of the Relief  Commission for  theprovisioning  of Belgium  and Northern  France,  His Majesty&apos;s  Government havedecided  to  instruct the Senior Naval Officers at  British ports of examination thatrelief vessels, once loaded, are not  to be  delayed  for any reasons of general  policyarising from differences that may exist between His Majesty&apos;s Government and  thecountry whose flag the vessel flies.  With  the same object in view, instructions havebeen  given to His  Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Washington to  propose to the UnitedStates Government that  all neutral  vessels  lying  in  United  States ports withfoodstuffs for neutral  European  countries  (foodstuffs for Sweden  and cereals  forDenmark excepted) should be allowed  to clear, on condition  that their consignees&apos;consent to the division of, say, two-thirds of  their cargoes to Rotterdam for Belgiumrelief purposes.  There are 56 Dutch ships now lying in United States ports  (of these42  are loaded with foodstuff  cargoes  amounting to  1.94,600 tons),  so  that  thisproposal, if adopted, would result in moving a considerable amount of tonnage.    In  response to  representations  of the Belgian  Government,  the  Treasury  on11th August transferred to the account of  the French Government 16,000,000  franca-in respect of the equalisation of the British, and French advances to Belgium.                                   GREECE.    On 8th August Mr.  Crackanthorpe reported, on the authority of His Majesty&apos;sConsul at Janina, that the Italian authorities were making no visible preparations to evacuate  Epirus.   They have refused  permission to certain Greek officials, includingthe Director of Agriculture, to proceed to Janina through their military lines.    Having reference to reports received of the ill-treatment of Albanians in Epirus,Mr. Crackanthorpe has been directed  to  intimate to M. Venizelos that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment  look  to him  to  take steps  to prevent  them  from being  injured  oroppressed.    In reply to a  query  as  to  the exact  position which the  Greek government considered it now stood in with regard  to  the  Central Powers, Mr. Crackanthorpetelegraphed  on 11th August that the present Greek Government regard  themselves as the successors of the  late Provisional Government, and that a  state of war exists between Greece and the Central Powers in virtue  of the Provisional Governmentsformal declaration of war made at Salonika.  The  existence  of  a state of war wasaffirmed in the speech from the Throne, and will be confirmed in the address in replythis week.    On 9th. August the Minister of Finance announced in the Chamber that he had ascertained that since the beginning of 1916 three loans of 40,000,000 drachmas eachwere  contracted in Germany by the Scouloudis and Lambros Ministries.  These loanshad been contracted without the knowledge and consent of Parliament, and had notbeen  mentioned in the 1916 Budget.  While the first two loans were  being concludedthe Greek Government was actually trying  to raise  a loan for 120,000,000 drachmasin  France and England.   The  second  loan  was  secured  about  the time  of the
surrender of Fort Rupel.   It is probable  that the  Ministers responsible  for  theseproceedings will be brought before a special tribunal.    Telegraphing on 9th August, Mr. Crackanthorpe described party feeling  in Greeceas outwardly quiescent, but doubted  if any real progress  towards reconciliation hadbeen made.  The Constantinists will continue to  work  quietly for the return of the-ex-King as long as they think there is  any hope of a German victory.  Any reverseon the Salonikan front might render M. Venizelos&apos;s position very difficult.    Mr. Crackauthorpe has suggested to his colleagues the desirability of getting KingAlexander more into touch with the Allied Legations as a step towards the reconciha-tion of rival parties, and to get the  King out of his present isolation where he is moreor  less in  the hands of  the former palace entourage.   The  Foreign  Secretary has approved  the  suggestion  subject to the consent of  the  French  Charge d&apos;Affaires.Referring to this, M. Venizelos on  the  11th told Mr.. Crackanthorpe  that  matters were complicated by the King&apos;s attachment to a young Greek lady of good familywhom  he had hoped  to  marry  before recent changes, a  fact  which might weighwith him in trying to secure his fathePs return as a means towards his own domestichappiness.   M. Venizelos added that he found that the ground gained by him in oneaudience with the King was invariably lost by the time the next audience took place.    The Minister  for Foreign  Affairs, M. Politis, has  confided to Mr. Crackanthorpethat he has telegraphed to Paris urging M. JonnarPs  return, as he looks to his strong-hand  to  keep in order the  more  extreme section among the French who aim at a virtual protectorate over Greece.    The British Military Attache reported on .10th August that he  had been informed by the Chief of the Greek General Staff that the 1916 and  .1917 recruit  classes are  tobe called, up for training at the end of the month.  Nothing  has been settled  as  tocalling up any classes of reservists.   The Greeks are  opposed  to  the French schemeof  putting in the field successive  divisions which  would  disorganise  their  whole system, and woidd prefer a general mobilisation  when the  necessary equipment is available.   The Military Attached  impression is that  nothing substantial can beexpected from the Greek  Army before February  or March next.   In his opinion the chance of arousing any enthusiasm in the  Greek Army and  nation  depends on theprospect of a military success on the Macedonian front.   The  national disinclinationto embark on a fresh war may  still, prove a trump  card for the Anti-Venizelist  party,which is  by no means dead.  Another factor of importance is the personality of theAllied. Commander-in-Chief.   The  Greek Army is not likely to take kindly to general sarrail after all  that- has happened, and the Chief  of Staff  did, in fact, ask  ratherpointedly whether he was to be replaced.    Meanwhile the evacuation of  Old Greece.is practically completed.  Small Frenchparties, however, remain at Larissa  and on  the railway as well as on the  Itea-Braloroad which- is being doubled to admit of motor lorry traffic both ways.   The  movementof Greek units from the Morea to their normal stations is proceeding slowly.    There appears to be  no foundation  for  the  rumours  that  the  French  militaryauthorities have  seized all  the Thessalian  crop  for  themselves.  They have  takenabout 7,000 tons.   No wheat has yet been  stored on  account of  the purchase by theGreek Government of the surplus of the Thessalian wheat crop.   The grain is  being-hidden and the Government do not feel strong enough to incur the risks attaching toforcible seizure of the stocks.    M.  Venizelos himself is very anxious as regards the financial situation, and  on 14th. August told  Mr.  Crackanthorpe that unless the Allies helped  him with a War Loan on.  a more generous scale  than the present proposals his Ministry -would have to resign.                          ALLIED ENEMY AFFAIRS.    Representatives of Germany, Austria, Hungary, Bulgaria and Turkey met in Vienna on 9th August to discuss the terms of economic agreement between them after the war. Germany&apos;s anxiety, to create an economic unit with her present Allies is not, on the face of it, consistent, Sir W. Townley points out, with, her insistence that  there shall be no economic alliance  directed against her after the war, and he suggests that attention. should be drawn, to this in order to encourage the weaker  enemy  vessels to stand out till they  can see what the futtue has in store for them. &apos; But no doubt Germany would be Avilling enough  to  disclaim  a  policy of tariff exclusiveness in Middle  Europe in-order  to  secure  most-favoured  terms  in the outside world, as  she can control the markets  of Middle Europe far more effectively by railway and canal rates,  as well as by cartels and syndicates covering the whole region.      36i,7-3                           &apos; C
                              GERMAN  AFFAIRS.    A German official wireless of 8th August  announced that Herr Schiller, leader ofthe National Liberal Party,  has been appointed  Director of the Imperial TreasuryOffice, Taxation Department.  By a special decree the post has  been converted into an Under Secretaryship of State.  Herr Schiller is 57 years of age and  the son of aforwarding agent.    The daily output of the Essen coal mines has fallen  from a pre-war average of1,200 to 784 tons.  The Dutch Vice-Consul at Essen in a recently published  articleobserves that the falling off in the production of  iron, coal, and potassium is  due to-three causes, viz., lack of labour, reduction in the individual energy of workmen, andshortage  of machinery and  tools.   At a recent meeting of  S,000 Essen  miners, aresolution was  adopted admitting  the necessity for an increased output;  it waspointed out, however, that this must depend upon the miners  getting better noitrisk-ment.   The present rations are insrrfficient and wages must  be raised to enable themen to get sufficient food.    Information  from  a reliable confidential  source goes to show  that  this year&apos;s-harvest in Germany is  likely to show a serious falling off  (estimated at about 30 percent.) as compared with that of 1916.  The latter was 25 per cent, below the average.J^he decrease is  attributed  by a competent observer as partly due  to  the greatscarcity of agricultural machinery,  which in its  turn is  due to the  lack  of  skilled labour for repairs, &amp;c.  Milk and meat production have fallen 40 per cent.    Sir W. Towuley sends the following first-hand  notes on the political colour  of thevarious new members of the Imperial and Prussian Ministries :     &quot;Imperial  Cabinet:  Chancellor,   Dr.   Michaelis,   Kaiser  cum  Hindenburggramophone record ; Chief of Cabinet,  Gravenitz,  thorough Conservative ; ForeignOffice, von Kuhlmann, Annexationist,  anti-U-boat as far as  neutrals  are  concerned,his under secretaries Bussche as before and  Stumm equally  as before, one  of thechief opponents of the Delbriick group ;  Home Office, A. (Economic), Dr. Schwander,an old Alsatian,  Mayor  of  Strassburg, claimed  as moderate  Liberal  (right wing  ofIndependents) ;  B.  (Military,  Educational,   Science, &amp;c), Herr Wallraff,  Mayor  ofCologne,  Free  Conservative  (left  wing of  Conservatives) ;  Admiralty, Capelle  as before (some people think Tirpitz may  come back) ; Justice, Dr. von Krause  (left wing&quot;of National Liberals) ;  Treasury,  von  Roeclern, Conservative, no change;  Under-Secretary ,Schiffer,  one  of leading  National Liberals, was expected  to  succeed lateBasserman  as  leader  of Party,  stands  midway  between  two extremes  of  it,and  has  been  largely instrumental in  keeping  two sections  together ; ColonialOffice,  Dr.  Solf,  no  change,  anti-annexationist,  but  determined   to  recoverColonial  Empire  or   substitute,  a  &apos;.Delbriick&apos;   man,  and,   if  anyone can  beso   called,   the   real   &apos; Parliamentary &apos;   candidate  for   the  Chancellorship ;Railways, von  Breitenbach,  no  change, Conservative Bureaucrat,  is  also PrussianMinister of Railways, and in that capacity has agreed to the  reform of the Prussianelectoral  system ; Post Office, Secretary  Riiedlin, Under Secretary Granzow, politicalcolour undefined ;  War Food Controller, also Prussian Commissary for Food Distri-bution, von Waldow, strict Conservative ; Undersecretaries, von Braun, Conservative,Dr.  August Midler,  Social Democrat.  In addition to  these, Helfferich  remains asVice-Chancellor, State Secretary  without rjortfolio.  He is most  unpopular  witheverybody in the Reichstag, but  is expected  to exercise effective control over  foreignpolicy, especially in its economic aspects.    &quot; Prussian Cabinet : Finance, Hergt, politics  uncertain ;  Education, Dr. Schmidt,.bureaucratic career,  no politics ; Interior, Dr. Drews, bureaucratic career ;  Justice,Dr.  Spahn, Leader  of  Centre  Party ;  War  Office, von Stein,  no  change ;  Agri-culture,  von  Eisenhart  Rothe, Conservative;  Railways and  Public  Works,  vonBreitenbach, see above.  Essential feature of  this Cabinet is that while it is  committed to electoral reform in Prussia, it is a Ministry chosen from the ranks of bureaucraticofficialdom.&quot;.                       AUSTRO-HUNGARIAN  AFFAIRS.   According to the Weekly Report of the Intelligence Bureau, dated  11th August,,Baron von Beck, who was Austrian Premier when Universal Suffrage was introduced in 1.906-7, is -widely regarded as the coming man.   Meanwhile, the Emperor is taking.
an active part in the negotiations which are continuing with the object of settling theAustrian internal situation before  the Peace Conference.   The  present  Premier,von Seidler,  has attempted,  so  far without  success,  to  detach the Jugoslavs  andUkrainians from the Slav block by the offer of portfolios.   The  Ukrainian  position  has  been  complicated  for  Austria   by the  russian revolution and the  prospect  of a real Ukrainian autonomy in a federalised RussianRepublic, or  even Ukrainian  independence.   The Ukrainians  in Eastern Galicia areno longer as enthusiastic over their deliverance from Russia as  they were  two yearsago, and the  Austrian  Government will have at once to face the embarrassing decision whether it is to recognise wholeheartedly the Ukrainian status of Eastern Galicia  atthe risk of offending the  Poles, or to complete the  process of throwing the AustrianUkrainians  into Russia&apos;s  arms.   The Intelligence Bureau notes  that  Archbishop&quot;Szeptycki, head  of the Ukrainian Uniate Church in Eastern  Galicia, has, since his release by  the  Russian  Provisional Government,  gone,  not  to   Austria,  but  toSwitzerland,  no doubt in order to keep his hands free for developments.   Among the Austrian Slavs generally there is evidently a good  deal of  difference  ofopinion as to the best tactics to  pursue, the opportunist section beiug prepared  todiscuss Austrian reconstruction by  itself, while the more  extreme  parties insist thatAustria-Hungary as a whole  must  be reconstructed.   In  this connection  the  mostinteresting   recent  developmeTit  is  the  tendency  of  Czechs  and other  Slavs,both  in speeches and articles, to dismiss the suggestion  of  internal reforms as nolonger worth serious consideration, and openly to pin their hopes  to the&apos; settlement which, they believe, will be imposed, upon Austria-Hungary in their interest by theEntente.  It is not easy to  judge,  however, how far this is simply the result of thenew policy which allows  the  subject races a greater liberty in letting off steam thanthey have had for three years, or how far it is based on a growing conviction of the imminent collapse of Austria-Hungary and of  the certainty of an Entente  victory.    The  Austro-Hungarian  non-Slav  press  generally  followed  the  line of  the&quot; Fremdenblatt&quot;  (see Report No.  28) in treating Lord R.  CeciPs  recent  speechas an attempt  to  drive  a wedge between Germany and Austria-Hungary, and  leadup to  a separate peace.  While  they one and  all scout the idea of a separate peaceas absurd, several of  them suggest that Austria-Hungary would, be quite willing  toact as a mediator.  The &quot; FremdenblatFs &quot; Berlin correspondent subsequently wureclin reference to criticisms tipon  this idea, in Pan-German circles  that he  had  been assured in  authoritative  quarters that if the Entente should seek a road for peacenegotiations  to  Germany through  Austria-Hungary,  Berlin  would be  not  merelysatisfied but delighted.  The Hungarian Socialist &quot; Nepszava &quot; comments  on the speech as follows : &quot;Behind&apos;all  utterances of this sort there is hidden the hope, no&quot; less ardent because  it is unrealisable,  of a separate peace.   The clumsy desires  of&quot; German diplomats to bring about a separate peace with Russia only provoked the&quot; Russian  offensive,  whose object  was to dissipate any  suspicious on  the subject.&apos;&quot; Cecil&apos;s  offer,  if it was  an  offer,  can fare  no  better.  These three  years have  so&quot; wrought the  fabric of  world events, forging together the unities grouped in  close&quot; alliance  on one side or the other, that all efforts to loosen particular threads must&quot; be futile.   Separate peace is no good as a  formula.   English diplomacy might just&quot; as well learn that from, the  RussO-German example.&quot;                                 &apos;  HOLLAND.   The Netherlands Minister in London reported on 8th August, with regard to theBergen incident, that His Majesty&apos;s Government tendered an apology for the violation of Dutch neutrality with regard to two of the ships, which were recognised to  havebeen attacked in Dutch territorial waters, but that the four others were considered aslawful  prize  having  been seized outside territorial  waters.   If the  netherlands government had any appeal to make against this decision  it  should be made in thePrize Court.  The Dutch Minister for Foreign Affairs pointed out to Sir W. Townleythat  this finding was at variance with that of the Dutch naval authorities, and that hisGovernment could not agree to the question of the violation of  its territorial rightsbeing  settled  in a  foreign  Prize Court.  He suggested,  that  the case should  besubmitted to an Anglo-Dutch or neutral Commission, or at least that a Dutch naval officer should be heard  in  London  or  an English officer  come over to examine theevidence on the  spot.
   On the same date Sir W. Townley expressed the serious concern of His  Majesty&apos;sGovernment  at a recent hint from the Minister of Agriculture  that  the  agreements with  the  Landhonw  Export Bureau and the  Netherlands  Oversea  Trust would haveto he  revised in consequence of the formation of the Central  Export Company, whichis more than suspected of  leanings  towards  the enemy.   The Minister for Foreign.Affairs  said  nothing  had  been decided, and  that the Export  Company was more-directed against Germany than against ourselves.   The difficulties with the Netherlands Oversea Trust, which led  to the breaking off of  all  official  relations with  the British  Legation, have  been  surmounted,  andcorrespondence will be resumed  forthwith.   The  Trust are sending a  summary oftheir  grievances, and. inviting  our Commercial Attache  to  attend  their  executivemeeting on the 17th to discuss the points.  Meanwhile,  the  British Government have continued to urge  Mr. Hoover unofficially to  negotiate in. regard to the release  ofshipping with the Trust, whose prestige it is most desirable to maintain, and  not withthe Netherlands Government which is advised by influences hostile to us.    Orders have been issued by the Dutch Government that no sand and  gravel are topass through from Germany as from 15th August to the end of the year.    Sir W. Townley telegraphed on  10th August urging that the existing scheme for providing English  coal to Holland should be  immediately revised as it has  proved a complete failure, and leaves Holland  entirely at Giermany&apos;s mercy as regards coal.Negotiations with Germany are  now proceeding, and the Germans are insisting bothon a considerably higher price and on definite undertakings with regard to the exportof Dutch agricultural produce.    His Majesty&apos;s Government have stated  that they are prepared to  drop the potatoquestion subject to the stoppage of the export to  Germany, an offer to us of 2,000tons of new potatoes  and certain minor conditions.   The potato question being settledthey  are prepared to resume the issue of letters of assurance on  the usual conditions,subject to American  licenses  being secured,  in the case of articles on the  UnitedStates embargo list, and,  in the case of non-embargoed goods,  subject  to  the usualconsiderations.  This is, however, not to apply to metals till a satisfactory undertaking-has been  obtained with  regard  to the  transit  of  metals between  Belgium andGermany.                                SWITZERLAND.   The projected loan to Germany, although it is to be made by a syndicate of Swissbankers, is  under the  auspices  of the Swiss Government and is part of  an inter-national agreement.   Sir H.  Rumbold  asks wffiether  the issue of such a loan from a neutral state to one belligerent  if facilities are refused to others  does not,  under international law, constitute an unneutral act ?                                  SWEDEN.   Sir E. Howard telegraphed on .13th August that the Austro-Hungarian Minister at stockholm, Count Hadik, had been appointed to a new post at Budapest, and was tohe succeeded by Count Tarnowski, lately Ambassador at Washington.  Sir E. Howardsuggests that this appointment was probably made to influence the Poles in Stockholm,and  possibly to secure  the assent of  the Russian Poles to the election  of ArchdukeCharles Stephen to the Polish throne.   In  a despatch of  26th  July on the political situation  in  Sweden, Sir E. Howardstates that the  main internal issues, viz., the abolition of  the plural cumulative vote for Municipal and Provincial Councils, which in turn elect the Upper House of theRiksdag, and full parliamentary control of  the  Government, have rather lost interest for the Swedes, who are mainly occupied with anxiety about their supply of foodstuffs and  raw materials.  A decided victory for the parties of the  Left is probable at the september elections, but an Allied demand on Sweden to  stop all exports of iron ore and  pulp to  Germany might be used for wffiat  it is w*orth  by the Conservatives todiscredit their pro-Entente opponents, and  an armed collision between Russia  and finland might give them an even better opportunity of working up the old anti-Russian.activist feeling.
                                       lo    The Swedish Government have been  endeavouring to  arrange  a  conference of neutral European Governments  at  Stockholm, nominally to  secure the protection  of neutral rights during the Avar and participation  in any changes  of international laAv-on  conclusion of peace.  The real object, however,  may  possibly&apos; be to dismiss acommon policy in view of the restriction of American imports.   It appears  that  theSwedish Minister for Foa-eign Affairs suggested that the  Spanish, Dutch, and SwissMinisters  in Stockholm  should discuss at Stockholm the  organisation of  such aConference.  Denmark is prepared to  take part, but  doubts if any practical resultswill follow.  The Norwegian Government.only agree to taking part  in the proposed conference if all the neutral European Powers accept.  The Norwegian papers have discussed the idea, and  contrary opinions  have  been  expressed, the most substantialNorwegian view  being  that Norway has nothing to gain, and probably something  to lose by making common cause Avith  her neutral neighbours.   The SAAUSS  federal council are prepared to discuss the question in principle, but Avill not decide till theyknoAV the programme to be  submitted.   It is understood that Spain  has declined thesuggestion, adding that Madrid would  he a more convenient place of meeting shouldsuch a conference be desirable.    This neutral conference  has nothing to do with  an inter-Scandinayian CommercialConference which will  be held in Stockholm,  probably under  the chairmanship  ofK.  A.  Wallenberg, on 14th  and 15th September.  The objects of this conference arethe promotion of joint industrial legislation, concession laws, and the consideration ofthe inter-Scandinavian exchange problem.                                   NORWAY.   Telegraphing on 13th August, Sir M. Findlay expresses the opinion that Germany&apos;present efforts to conciliate Norwegian sympathies show that she clearly appreciatesthe danger of forcing Norway into the Avar, and providing  us and the United  states with, a naval base in Scandinavian waters.   A statement attributed to Dr. Krieger atthe recent interview at Sassnitz, that if  Norway cut  off her exports to Germany itwould  mean war,  may  only have been  bluff which  Germany has to keep up, andwhich the Norwegian Government Avill no  doubt use to try  and soften the heart ofAmerica.   Dr. Nansen, just before  going to America,  emphasised the belief that thecomplete  stoppage  of exports would mean  war, but  the  fact that  he  has gone to america Avith an absolutely free  hand to make any  arrangement without  further reference  to  his Government is, in Sir  M. Find]ay?s opinion, an indication  that  theNorwegian Government themselves do not  really fear attack.   With regard, to the effectiveness of the pressure Avhich the United&apos; States can puton Norway in the matter of petroleum and  lubricating  oil, Sir M. Findlay reports thatthe quantities of both received from Germany are  very  small,  and that it is improbable that she could supply enough to make Norway independent.                                    SPAIN.   The railway strike on the Norte railway began  on the night of 10th August.   sir arthur  Hardinge  telegraphed,  on 12th August that the strike Avas to become general on the following  day.   This:wide development was in advance of  the wishes of theParliamentarists, but if it  looked like succeeding  they would  put themselves  at itshead.  The army  Avere  siding  with the Parliamentarists.   The object  of the  strikeAvas to overthrow the existing regime.   The Government proclaimed  martial law  on the 13th.

The authoritiesare taking  energetic measures to control the situation, and, according to Press reports,haye arrested the.leading revolutionaries in Madrid.

   On 8th August the-Japanese Foreign. Minister sent for Sir Conyngham Greene and&apos;said  that as it was now  clear that the Chinese  Government was  prepared to declare war  on Germany the time had come for the Allied Powers to agree definitely as to the offers to be made to China in-satisfaction of China&apos;s previously expressed desires,  liesubmitted a  memorandum  embodying  the  following  proposals : - (I) As  regardsCustoms  Tariffs, an effective 5 per  cent., instead, of a  40 per cent., surtax on  thepresent tariff.   This  it is suggested would  meet with  the general approval, of  theAllied Governments.   In this  connection the Japanese Government is prepared to waive the claim to put forward the abolition of the cotton export duties as an essential condition, but  reserves the right  of  putting  the matter forward as  a Japanesedesideratum at an opportune moment.   It also  proposes to ask for certain modifica-tions of the existing tariff classification in the interests of Japanese trade, and suggeststhat, if in consequence of any  delay thereby involved the Chinese Government is in need of money, a  portion of the proposed loan  of 10,000,000/. might be advanced tomeet the  emergency.   (2) As regards the Boxer Indemnity, a postponement  withoutinterest  for  five years this instead of the previous British proposal to  remit  fiveyears&apos; instalments.  (3) As regards  the access of  Chinese  troops  to  the town ofTientsin,  not to depart from the attitude previously taken up.    On the following  day the  Foreign Minister handed  in  a  strict!y  confidentialmemorandum on the  general situation in China.  This  document  states  that  whilePrince Tuan&apos;s Provisional Government is not yet stable, an agreement seems to havebeen reached with Vice-President Feng, and the lattefs  approval  of the declaration ofwar is now regarded as possible.  The only form of government which, in the opinionof the Japanese Government, has  any chance of securing even relative stability is onebased on  agreement between   the  Northerners and the principal  elements in the progressive  Party.  The Southerners are, at present at any rate, quite incapable of:forming  a stable Government.   Consequently  the  Japanese Government, though itwishes that statesmen of all parties could, agree to form a strong Coalition Government,and.  has  no prejudice  against  any particular party, is convinced  that any encourage-ment or material support given to the  Southerners at this juncture by one or more ofthe  Allies would only compromise the restoration of order in China and should be discouraged.   The warning conveyed in this  last passage has,  in Sir  C. Gree.ne&apos;opinion, special reference to the  possibility of  ill-judged  interference  by Americanpoliticians in Chinese affairs.    The  Japanese  suggestion  was  that, if  the British Government agreed  to  thegeneral  policy  thus laid down, the  Japanese Government  would inform the UnitedStates Government of the  views of the two Governments, and  also  inform  other-Allies interested  in  China.   The Foreign  Office  while fully endorsing the mainprinciple of the memorandum, namely, that the Allies should wholeheartedly support a Central Government, suggests, in its reply  of the  13th, that  the best procedure-would be for Japan to address  an identic note to ourselves,  the United States and theother Allies.   \\re  could then  adhere to it and  at once notify the other Governmentsconcerned of our adherence.     As regards the terms to be  offered to China  the British  Government, while notingthat the  terms are somewffiat less favourable to China  than  those  which it had beenprepared  to give, replied,  on  the  10th that it  regarded them  as a  fair basis ofdiscussion between the Allied representatives at  Peking, and that it was instructing His Majesty&apos;s Charge d&apos;Affaires in that sense.   With regard to the proposed changes in the tariff classification, it refrained from, expressing any opinion  in the absence of information as to their precise character.     On 10th August Sir C.  Greene telegraphed that a further note from the Japanese&apos; Government stated that the negotiations for  the American purchase  of  the Austrian; ships had stopped, and that the Japanese were  negotiating for them and expected an early result.   The note added that  the Japanese Government already knew that His:/Majesty-s Government had  no  objection in principle to Japanese purchase, but wished. to  ascertain the British view  as  to their  subsequent disposal.  In  view of  this, Mr.  Alston-  has enquired whether  there  has been a change in the attitude  of the British Government, as even the  Japanese Legation at Peking  were still under the impression on the 8th that  the matter of purchase was left enti rely  in our hands.   As-.a matter of fact the  Chinese Premier had just informed  him that he had refused permission  to  a Chinese intermediary, acting  oil Japanese behalf,  to purchase these- ships, and would have to consult his Cabinet before answering  the  British offer to purchase them.
                                     JAPAN.   The understanding  between Japan and the British  Government with regard ,tothe Pacific Islands, and  the general character of the assistance in the war furnished by Japan, are the subject of  a long  telegraphic despatch  to Washington dated11th August.  The circumstances under which His Majesty&apos;s Government undertook,on the occasion of a Peace Conference, to support the Japanese claim to the retentionof the German Pacific Islands  lying north of the Equator, in return for a correspondingJapanese promise of support of  the British claim to the German  islands  south of theEquator, and the subsequent naval assistance afforded by Japan in the Mediterranean,Indian Ocean and Pacific, are summarised.  AVith regard to  military assistance, thedespatch points out that the question has been raised  more than once, and that, whilethe Japanese Cabinet were not unfavourable to  the idea, the Japanese General staff have consistently declared  the project impracticable  owing to lack of shipping, the congestion, on the Siberian, railway, and the fact that their conscript army could notconstitutionally  be employed outside the Empire.  On  the  other hand,  valuable assistance has been rendered in the provision of  military  equipment, and  Russia, moreparticularly, has  greatly benefited in  this  way, though the Japanese Staff  has beenvery reluctant to trench on its reserve  stocks, and has refused  to send Japanese  guncrews and teams  to the Russian front.   The view of His  Majesty&apos;s Government is thatwhile Japanese statesmen are  willing to render valuable  aid  to the Allies in variousdirections, the Japanese Staff  is unwilling, and  the Government probably unable, tosend any form of military expedition to a  European field of operations.  An  appeal from the United  States for such an expedition is consequently hardly likely to meet with any success. More hopeful is the prospect of securing for Allied purposes someportion of the total Japanese mercantile tonnage.                                    SIAM.   AVith regard  to the French application  for  the appointment  of  an additionalFrench sub-manager to the Siam Commercial  Bank, Mr. Bering points out that theappointment would be purely redundant, and adds that owing to French representationsthe Siamese Government have already offered to create in favour of a French nomineethe post of a reporter on trade matters in the Commerce and  Statistics  Branch of theMinistry of Finance with remuneration corresponding to  that of  a bank  accountant.  &apos; AVith regard to  the seized enemy vessels, His Majesty&apos;s Government are proposing that thej&apos; should be allotted on the basis of 35 per  cent, each to the British and french governments, and  30  per  cent, to  the Japanese Government.  They urge, however,that the Japanese Government should allow these ships to be  time chartered to an approved  firm  for  the European trade.   The  United States  Government are being asked to discourage private firms attempting to purchase the vessels.                                  URUGUAY.   Representations have been  made  to  the Governments  of France and  the UnitedStates asking them to  support  the claim that British and. French warships  maybeallowed the same facilities for visiting Uruguayan ports as  those already given  by theUruguayan Government to United States vessels.    Mr. Alston telegraphed on 13th August that after careful consideration he thinksit desirable to keep open  both the coolie depots.   The Chinese Government cannotinterfere with the  Tsing-tau recruiting organisation.  In  the  absence of  a formal agreement, which for various reasons is at this moment undesirable, they can interferewith the arrangements for recruiting for Wei-hai-wei.  Tsing-tau  has also a capacityof dealing with 10,000 coolies a month as  against 6,000 at Wei-hai-wei.   But a&quot; theformer is entirely dependent  on the goodwill of the Japanese military authorities, asecond independent organisation is advisable.  The  practice of sending coolies  fromTsing-tau to Wei-hai-wei  is, however, to  be discontinued.  The War  Office  havereceived  a report that recruitment is obstructed at Tientsin  by a Chinese  official whoimprisons and tortures recruiters.
                                     CHILE.   There appears to be a great deal of unnecessary competition  not only among theAllies but even among different American Departments  in the Chilean nitrate market,and  the United States Ambassador at Santiago is suggesting that such  competitionshould be somewhat restricted.                                     PERU.   The Peruvian Government have addressed enquiries to idis Majesty&apos;s Governmentand to that of the United States  regarding their proposed utilisation of six Germansteamers interned, five at Callao and one at Mollendo.  The terms  suggested by thePeruvian Government amount to virtual  seizure of the  ships.   They would fly thePeruvian flag and be manned by Peruvian crews without making any payment eitherduring the war or on  account of  charter  or purchase.   They wotdd be used mainly for the transport of supplies between Peru  and  ports  in the United States  andArgentine.  The Peruvian Government also claim  option  of purchase  at the end ofthe war at a price to be arranged then.   The Peruvian Government have  addressed,  a note demanding an indemnity fromthe German Government for sinking the &quot;Lorton.&quot;  due President is reported to be resolved on insisting on an indemnity and refusing any compromise.  The impression in Lima is  that the rupture of relations  with Germany may not be long delayed.   The Peruvian Senate  have approved a vote of  sympatlry with the Government ofthe United States of America and with the declaration  of President Wilson.                                    BRAZIL.   The attitude of His Majesty&apos;s Government  regarding the importation of Braziliancoffee is bound up with the question of the utilisation of.the ex-German ships.   It isnow proposed that  if  at least one-half  of  the ex-German tonnage is placed at thedisposal of  the Inter-Allied Chartering Bureau, Great Britain will allow a proportion(up to 50 per cent.) of  the imports of  coffee from Brazil to this country in 1916 to heshipped.  The United States are being consulted with  a  view to obtaining  their concurrence with this suggestion.                                    PANAMA.   His  Majesty&apos;s Consul at  Colon reports that although promises were given last june  by the United States Government  that British transports should  have facilitiesfor using the Panama Canal, these facilities are  being limited to those laid down bythe Canal Neutrality  Proclamation.  Urgent  representations have accordingly beenmade to Washington for full facilities, and a renewed  request put forward  for repair and supply facilities at Balboa.  Two transports are due on  30th August.  The whole scheme for the transport of Australasian troops  through the Canal, will  be wreckedif the neutrality restrictions are enforced.   They are not being enforced on  Americanwarships, and the right of so differentiating is open to serious question.                                   MEXICO.   The United  States  Government have received a  similar  letter  from  GeneralCarranza  to that sent by the latter to His  Majesty the  King.  They have not yetreplied, but wdll communicate with the British Government when they decide  to  doso.   At any rate,  they  do not  propose to extend  de  jure  recognition  to  GeneralCarranza&apos;s assumption of the Presidency.   There  is continued talk of the United States using influence to persuade Mexico toenter the war on the side  of  the Allies.  The United States Ambassador at Mexico isfavourable to  this idea, and so, it is&quot;  understood, is General Pablo Gonzalez.  TheUnited States Ambassador urges that it will be much easier to keep Carranza in order as an Ally, and, if necessary, land in Mexico on the plea of defending the oil interests,and that we should always still retain  our right of punishing him afterwards for his
pastjmisdeeds.   Mr. Cummins wires thai lie considers the arguments and. views of theUnited-States Ambassador unsound, and likely to increase difficulties.   In this connection it is  reported  that all the; eleven German  ships  interned atSanta Rosalia are mined, and that the vessels will be  blown up if Mexico joins  theAllies.-  )0&apos;           -                    UNITED   STATES.   ; Telegraphing on 12th August, Sir 0. Spring Rice  described popular  opinion as not  wholly satisfactory with regard to  tire war.   Peace propaganda is open  and active, more particular])&apos; in the  German and&apos; Hearst Press, while  there is a certain.sullenness about the draft, and German agents are working with some success amongthe labouring classes to increase the cost and difficulty of preparations  for war.  Onthe-other, hand, the  tone  of  the Press, which  is under the Presidents influence, is satisfactory and firm.  The Presidents Republican enemies are, however, spreading&apos; areport that, in alarm at the intense unpopularity of the war, he is meditating a seriouspeace movement.    With reference to Mr. McAdoo&apos;s  proposal for  a European  Inter-Allied Council, to lay the needs of the Allies  as  regards finance  and supplies  before the  AmericanTreasury&apos;.:and  an   American.  Purchasing  Commission  respectively  (see  reports nos.  26-28),  Lord Northcliffe and Messrs. Gordon  and Brand communicated  to theForeign.; Secretary on  9th August the draft of  their proposed reply, to  which they propose appending as  a &quot; Memorandum on Finance&quot; a somewhat  edited  version ofthe Chancellor of the Exchequers  telegram to Lord  Northcliffe of 2nd AugustusesReport No. -28).  In their covering  remarks,  the  senders of  the  telegram  stronglyurge that the proposed  Council  might be described as the  &quot; Military Inter-allied council in Europe,&quot; in order to get rid of  the suspicion in Congress and  among theAmerican public that  the huge demands  of the Allies  are  largely for non-military purposes  after the war, and to enable Mr. McAdoo to assure Congress that the money.he is asking for is to lie spent directly and solely on. furthering  the war.    The draft  begins  by expressing  the readiness  of  His  Majesty&apos;s Government toaccept for immediate adoption  the proposed  appointment of an Inter-Allied Councilin London to co-ordinate  all. the Allied requirements for American supplies and to transmit them to a United States Government Purchasing Commission.   This councils to deal with (1) Supply, (2) Finance, (3) Transport.   On  the question of supply the draft  expresses agreement in principle with the American  proposal, but suggeststhe advisability of  dealing with food and munitions in distinct  sections.   On thequestion of finance it points out  that in  so far as the Inter-Allied Council is in aposition to determine  its financial  requests,  these can be transmitted through theCouncil,  but  that,  inasmuch as  the Chancellor of  the Exchequer must  always be finally responsible for British financial requirements, it  is essential that he shouldcontinue  to deal directly with  the  United States  Treasury.   In  support of this  itquotes  the &quot;  Memorandum on  Finance&quot;  to show that the ultimate determination ofthe true financial requirements  will have to involve many factors outside those coveredby the  report of the Inter-Allied Council, whose members, moreover, will be primarilynot -financial  experts, but men concerned with  supply questions, as well as the&quot; Memorandum on Exchange &quot; recently handed to the United States Treasury.   Withregard to tonnage the  draft,  while agreeing that a freight programme in general terms should be laid down by the Inter-Allied Council, points out that this country, as theprincipal  provider  of  shipping  for the   whole Alliance,  cannot, in  view of thedifficulties and risks of thetonnage position, consent to  hand, over the allocation oftonnage  to  an  Inter-Allied Council,  but  must  continue  to deal with  each Allyseparately as regards tonnage, just  as the United States does in allocating  dollarcredits.    With  regard to Mr. McAdoo&apos;s Memorandum of Agreement (see Report No. 26)in regard to  purchases in  the United States, the  draft suggests that  the British Government shall set up  in the  United  States a Supply Department through  whichit  shall notify  to the  corresponding authority  or  authorities  set  up  by the United- States Government  all its demands  for materials and supplies.  After consultation. the aforesaid  American authority  shall  then determine, in each  case, whether to make the purchases itself on behalf of the British Government, or to leave the British Supply     3657-3                               E
ISDepartment to do  so  subject  to whatever  conditions may be laid down.  The draftsuggests, in conclusion, that the newly created War Industries Board might1;serve as;the American authority in question.                                    didd iVdrnU    Since  this telegram was despatched, Mr. McAdoo  has told Sir C. Spring Rice&apos;thatif  he  could communicate  to  the Committee of Congress some  sort ;&apos;6f&apos;Avrittenconvention  with  regard to Allied  purchases  it would  greatly strengthen his handsin laying before Congress his  further proposals for financial help to the Allies.    On 12th August Sir  C. Spring  Rice  telegraphed  that Mr. McAcloo  had suggested to  Congress a further bond  issue  of $6,000,000,000  at  4 or 44  per cent.   Supple-mental estimates  for  war expenses  had  been submitted  for nearly $S,000,000,000,of  which only  $2,000,000,000  would  be  provided  by  the  War &apos;Revenue  Bill.Controversy in Congress was anticipated.on these demands.              .p. r--.!    With regard to exchange Mr. McAcloo is willing to help, but determined not&apos;to ask:Congress for money for that  purpose in so many words.   An idea he  has&apos;1 mooted toMr. J. P. Morgan is that  if the British Government would take over the purchases ofcotton in  America on  British private  account  (possibly  also  those of meat and tobacco) this would reduce the volume  of sterling  bills on offer, while -the money would be included in the general  advance to cover British Government purchases.-(This suggestion does not, at first  sight, appear easy  to reconcile with Mr. &apos;Mb-&apos;A*doo&apos;sanxiety, mentioned above, to be able to assure  Congress that all the advances are&apos; for purely- military purposes.)                                             *-i  J&quot;&apos;    The Indian Government has suggested  to  the Treasury the possibility of  floatingin the United States a loan charged on Indian revenues, the proceeds to be remitted to  India  in gold.   The  object  is  to  help   the  Indian   Government to -maintainconvertibility and  replenish  its cost balances.    They are anxious,  however, that nothing should  be  done in this  respect that  might prejudice their negotiations-for obtaining payment in gold for jute exported  from India to the United  States&apos; or lead the United States Government to place obstacles in the way of private shipments ofgold to India or to  Japan with ultimate destination to India.  The Chancellor of theExchequer, in forwarding the suggestion  to Sir II. Lever,  expresses the view that itis highly improbable that the United States Government would  sanction the floatingof such a loan.    The British Government have  drawn up a memorandum dealing with the wholequestion of  United States co-operation in the blockade,  including the naval  andmilitary consequences which might arise out of increased pressure upon neutrals.  Asummary  of the  proposals contained in  this memorandum was  telegraphed-to sir c. Spring Rice on  9th August under the following headings : (1)  The United states should intimate to the border  neutrals that unless certain  changes are made in their exports to Germany license could  not be  issued  for the  principal exports  to theseneutrals.  The advantage of  the United States taking the lead would be that, thesecountries  would  be less  likely in.  that case  to  divert to  Germany  the  importantfood supplies they now send  to us.  (2) In the  case of Sweden the stoppage of theexport of iron ore and the  grant of free transit to Russia should  be  particularlyinsisted on, though a complete cessation  of exports to Germany should, be  asked for.(3) Norway should be asked to stop all exports of metals, ores,.fish and canned goods.(4) Denmark  and Holland should  stop the export of fish  and  agricultural produce,and the latter should stop the transit trade between Germany and Belgium;11  (5) TheBritish Government will  bo prepared to buy up commodities which would-otherwise have  gone to Germany, if the United States will support the exchange withthe neutralsconcerned.   (6) Each neutral to be asked to guarantee  that no impediment should beput in the way of  exports  to  the Allies.   (7)  Replies to  be  asked for within a very short, time ; on their receipt  the United  States and  the Allies could consider if theoriginal demands should  be in any way modified.  (.S)  If  the adoption of-this policy-is interfered with by any existing agreements these should be modified  or terminated.(9) Exports to a neutral as  the price of a  special service or concession  may  becontinued. - (10) A Joint Blockade Council of American and British representatives to be formed immediately in London to consider,  more particularly, questions under(7) and (S) above and to deal with exports  to border neutrals from other neutrals suchas South America.   (11) To help  existing negotiations to secure  shipping for allied services the United States might insist upon Sweden  and Holland resuming sailings.    Commenting on this, Sir G. Spring Rice  urged on  the 12th that  if, for reasons give  under (1) above, we cannot present an identical communication to neutrals, wemust   at least  allow  the United States in their communication to state  that  their
-demands  are  made  in  full agreement with His  Majesty&apos;s Government.  The state department refuses to be put in the position, in which we allowed the  French  to put us for the first two years of the war,  of the  &quot; guilty partner &quot;  in  blockade matters.To  &quot; take the lead &quot;  was just what  he feared  the  United  States would not do.  he also expressed doubts as to the Presidents agreeing to the  proposed Joint BlockadeCouncil.  Meanwhile he had handed in an official communication which  in  general terms stated the readiness  of His Majesty&apos;s Government to act concurrently with theUnited States in stopping exports, and to modify or terminate any existing agreementsinterfering with the adoption of the proposed policy without special  counterbalancingadvantages, and  urged  early  action  on  the  basis  of  full identity  of policy and responsibility with the United States  Government.    Dealing with Sir  C.  Spring Rice&apos;s criticisms,  the Foreign Office  replied  on the13th that we were ready to refuse licenses on all  goods  on our export prohibitionlist (which includes all the goods on the American  list) pari passu  with the  UnitedStates   Government, - excepting  only  coal  which  is  pledged  for  our  tonnagearrangements, and those raw  materials we send  to be returned in  finished  shape,e.g., margarine from  Holland.   We have few agreements which commit us  to  furnishsupplies  to  neutrals,  and  we   are  prepared  to  consider their modification  orabandonment.  As regards the Joint  Blockade Council, the British  Government  isquite content that it  should be in Washington.   &quot;The great thing is that  quick  action should be taken  without long diplomatic correspondence.   As for &quot; taking  the  lead,&quot;it must, in fact come  from the  United  States,  as  America produces the bulk  of the products essential to the northern neutrals, and  therefore  is alone in a position  toapply effective pressure.    In  a telegram of loth August Sir C. Spring  Rice  deals with  the necessity for expanding the existing  Commercial  Attached organisation into an  effective-  Com-mercial Commission  with large responsibility and  a free  hand.  -Meanwhile the workof preparation for this development should be carried on  quietly in  order to  avoid giving the impression that we are thinking too  much of our after the war trade.    The question of drafting British subjects into the American Army has been raisedby the Secretary for  War.  There  is  strong feeling against  British subjects  in theUnited  States who are avoiding enlistment.   Sir C. Spring Rice has replied that  hewould  not, without  instructions from the Foreign Office, make representations  if british subjects wdio had not responded to our own call  to the colours were draftedinto the American Army.    The Food  Control Bill was signed on  13th August, and Mr. Hoover  appointedFood Controller.    The British railway companies will provide  two ambulance trains for the american forces in France.                          THE SHIPPING SITUATION.     The new American Shipping Board, though friendly, is apparently very much afraid of Mr. Denmaifs organised press  attacks;   His line is that Britain will  hold the commercial control of  all the  seas after the Avar unless the United States retains for its  own use all  ships  building in American yards.  If political pressure on the Shipping Board  proves too  strong,  and we cannot  insist  on retention of  British ownership, Sir C. Spring  Rice suggests  that  we  should press firstly for  British controlled  ownership under  the American  Hag, with the hope of transfer  after the war,  and failing that,  for a  firm  agreement  that  all  ships originally built  to our account  should be  operated  for war purposes only and after  consultation leaving ownership  to be decided later.     With regard to the proposed transfer of: six German vessels in Dutch East Indian. ports to the Dutch flag  as compensation  fur the  sinking of six Dutch vessels in the* Channel, His Majesty&apos;s Government agree not  to interfere with these ships provided they are forthwith placed in the Belgian Relief Service and continue in  it as long as the Allies require.   The transfer must be outright, no German interest being reserved, and the cargoes now on board must be unloaded and full cargoes for Belgian  relief substituted.  Similar conditions are to apply to the German steamer offered, in  place -of the torpedoed S.S. &quot; Blommersdyk.&quot;      3857-3                              F
   On 8th August Mr. Clive sent.a telegram from Stockholm describing the general.attitude of the Swedish shipowners with regard to the proposed shipping agreement.They hint that the Swedish Government will refuse to sanction any shipping agreement.without a definite assurance as to imports, and may otherwise  prefer to see Swedishtonnage  laid  up.  Mr. Olive thinks the chances of an agreement under the present government  are problematical.  Meanwhile  he recommends that  outward facilitiesfrom Sweden should be fieely given so that as many ships as possible should be away from Sweden if we should eventualby decide to requisition Swedish tonnage.                             PEACE DISCUSSIONS.    On  9th August Count de Salis telegraphed a summary of the Pope&apos;s appeal to the-belligerent Governments, the full text of which has now appeared in the Press.  Afterasking whether Europe is not tending to its own  suicide, he proposes as the basis ofa &quot; just and  durable peace,&quot; the consideration of  the following &quot; concrete practicalproposals,&quot; leaving, however, to the Governments the care of stating the points more precisely.  There is to  be  simultaneous and  reciprocal  reduction of armaments ;.armies are to be  replaced by arbitration.  Once  the supremacy of  law is establishedthere should be no obstacle  to communication between peoples, but a true liberty and common enjoyment of  the seas.  The only solution  in the matter of indemnities  is ageneral mutual condonation, though special  cases might be weighed with equity and.justice.  There  should  be  reciprocal  restitution  of territories  actually occupied,including the German  Colonies.  Germany should evacuate Belgium with a guarantee of its complete political,  military, and economic independence.  Territorial questionssuch as Alsace Lorraine  and Italia Irredenta  are to be examined by both parties in a conciliatory spirit, bearing in mind the aspirations  of the peoples.   The same spiritof eqtuty and justice should direct the examination of such questions as Armenia, the balkan States,  and the territories of the ancient Kingdom of Poland.    In a subsequent conversation with the Cardinal Secretary of State Count de Salisascertained that the &quot; special case &quot; as regards  indemnities was meant to apply solely to Belgium.  The Cardinal  could  not give  any definite meaning to the phrase aboutfreedom of the  seas, but  said  they had  taken the words from President Wilson  andMr. Churchill.    On 8th August M. Nabokoff sent a letter  to Mr. Balfour  stating that in view of theimpression in the Press here that &quot; Russia ardently desired the Stockholm Conference &quot;&apos;he had recently telegraphed to his Government a  summary  of  the  discussions on thequestion in this country, concluding  by expressing the view that it was essential, inorder to safeguard the  closeness of  the uniou with Great Britain, where the majorityof public opinion is opposed to  the  Conference, that he should be in a position to declare to the British Government that the matter was one which the Russian Govern-ment regarded not as a matter  of state but as a party concern, and that the decisionsof the Conference, if  convened, would in no way  be binding on  Russian policy oraffect Russia&apos;s  relations with her Allies.  In  response to  this he had  received atelegram entirely approving  a  declaration  in the sense suggested and authorisinghim to  inform the  Foreign  Secretary that, although  the Russian Government  donot deem it  possible  to prevent  Russian  delegates  taking  part  in  the  stockholm conference, they look upon this  Conference  as  a  party affair and do not regard:its decisions  as in any  way binding upon the freedom of action of the Government.    On  11th  August,  however,  in  consequence   of a  telephonic  message  fromM.  Tseretelh. who  is strongly in  favour  of  the  Stockholm Conference, M. Kerenskyand M. Terestchenko informed Sir G. Buchanan that though they would  much  rather that the&apos; Conference did not  meet, they could  not prevent russian Socialists going if it did meet, and  in that case would like Allied Socialists  to  go too.  M. Kerenskythought  that the Allies  should, send their  Socialists to make  a  stand  against  the-Germans and  carry the Conference  with them.   Refusal on. the part of the AlliedGovernments to-allow their  Socialists to attend would tend to create a movement ofopinion in favour of Germany and thus add to the difficulties of the Government.    In reply to  a telegram sent to Paris, Rome,  and  Washington on  10th August,  withregard to the decision Of His Majesty&apos;s Government  to make an announcement  that.no passports  will  be granted for British subjects to attend  the Stockholm Conference,.asking if they could state  simultaneously  that  the French, Italian, and American:
Governments were taking the  same  line,  answers  were received from all  these governments authorising the  statement that they would refuse passports.   The French Socialist Party,  after two  days&apos; discussions, in the course of which it received the news of the British Labour Party&apos;s decision, decided on 11th August toparticipate in the Stockholm Conference, laying  down  the  principles on which thedecision to accept the invitation was based in a long and wordy resolution indicativeof the internal  divisions of the Party and of the knowledge  that public opinion is against them.   The knowledge that passports are  going to be refused in any case haslent an air of unreality to the proceedings.   The &quot; Vorwarts &quot; in commenting  on the  British Labour Party&apos;s decision says that&quot; Germany welcomes British participation in Stockholm as  the first  step which is bound to be followed by others in their logical sequence.&quot;   The British Labour Party&apos;s proposed peace terms which have recently appeared inthe Press, have  been generally denounced in the  German Press as intolerable  andpreposterous.   It is rumoured in Germany that Dr. Helfferich will be placed at the head of a new commission which is to be appointed for the  purpose of  working out peace conditionswith a view to the eventual Peace Conference.                                  GENERAL.   His Majesty&apos;s  Government have instructed  Sir  H. Rumbold  to  propose to theTurkish Government a meeting of  delegates in  Switzerland to  discuss questions relating to the exchange  and treatment of combatant and civilian prisoners on thelines of the recent discussion at The Hague, and to ascertain if the Swiss Governmentwould facilitate the meeting in the same way as was donejjy the Dutch Government.Lord  Newton  and  General Belfield  would be  the British  delegates.  The  SwissMinister for Foreign Affairs has expressed his willingness to preside over the proposed conference and is asking the Turkish Minister  to  telegraph to his  Government atonce.   The Dutch Internment Department  proposes to billet  the British and  german prisoners of war  interned in Holland in private  houses, and  have asked for peoplewilling to offer  accommodation to  state  number,  rank and nationality they  canaccommodate.   Shipping  companies  have also  been approached with a  view to accommodation on   board  passenger  vessels.    Sir  W.  Townley  thinks  these arrangements preferable to the building of internment  camps.
