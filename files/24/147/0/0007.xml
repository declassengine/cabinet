SECRET.APPRECIATION  OF  THE,ATTACHED  WESTERN AND  GENERAL                           REPORT,/ No.  32, ..      [                            IXTKIt-lMI-EIMAFj EXCIIANCJ 10.   A new aspect of this problem is presented by the American suggestion that if theUnited States give us credit for goods they send to England, the British  Governmentshould arrange to  provide  them with credit for  goods  they  buy from  India  and australia.                                     FRANCE.   The political situation is evidently very unstable.   lint the recent, revelations mayhave helped to clear the air, and have, at any rate,  made some nasty rents in the webof M. Caillaux&apos;s intrigues.                                     SERBIA.   Ml  Pashitch&apos;s urgent appeal for  help,  the Emperor Charles&apos;s remarks  about aSerbian  Kingdom  in  an Austrian Confederation, and  the  indications  of  a  moreconciliatory attitude to Serbia on the  part of Bulgaria,  should be studied together.Unless the Allies are willing  to  make some effort to relieve  the exhausted SerbianArmy,  and treat the Serbian Government as  in  the  fullest  sense  one  of themselves,they must be prepared not only for desertion on a large scale this winter, but even for the possibility of the Serbian Government listening to the enemy&apos;s terms.                             ENEMY ALLIED AFFAIRS.   The Emperor  Charles&apos;s declarations in favour of a renovated Austrian confederationon democratic and nationalist lines, free from subserviency to Prussian militarism, donot,  when  allowance is made for  the distorting  medium  of  Professor Forstersdescription, probably mean much more than  we already know as to his federalistleanings and his eagerness to be less completely under German control.  They donot imply any breach with Germany or any  real abandonment  of  the Middle  Europepolicy, but only a desire to give Middle Europe a more Austrian and nationalist and aless  Prussian-Magyar complexion, and  to increase Austrian  influence in it by directlyincorporating Rumania and Serbia in a new Austrian body politic.   Meanwhile in Germany the annexationist, as against the Middle Europe, tendencyhas no doubt been greatly strengthened,  by the capture of Riga, which  will probably also be further exploited as a warning against the disastrous con sequences.of democracy.The revelations as to Sukhomlinoffs  and Y&quot;anushkevitch&apos;s part in forcing mobilisationupon the Tsar are also being worked for all  they  are worth as  a retort to PresidentWilson&apos;s message,  and  in  confirmation of  the theory that the Central Powers arewaging a defensive war.
                                      CHINA.   If the Allied Governments concur in the decision of the French Government thatthe increase of China&apos;s import tariff to 5 per cent, must be conditional upon theabolition of lekin dues, China is not likely to receive any increase of Customs revenuein the immediate future.  Many foreigners hoped that lekin would have been abolishedby the Mackay Treaty (190.1), but  the fact remains  that the Central Government hasneither sufficient authority to abolish these inland levies on trade nor ataj-thing to offer the provinces in return  for the  revenues involved.                                  UNITED STATICS.    The  need for the education  of  American public opinion on  the subject of theGerman colonies is obvious.    But till America  is more  whole-heartedly in the warthan at present the process of education will have  to  be  quiet and confined,  hi thefirst  instance,  to making  Americans realise  the  impossibility  of  restitution  toGermany.

PART   I.-BRITISH  EMPIRE  AND   AFRICA.                                   CANADA.    At a meeting of the Conservative party  held  at  Ottawa on 29th August,  sir robert Borden reviewed the course of his negotiations after the failure of his overturesto  Sir  Wilfrid Laurier for the  formation  of a Union or  National   Government.The Western Liberals,  with whom he had lately been in communication, were infavour  of a  National  Government, but  they considered  a  change  of  leadershipessential and submitted four names for the Premiership, of which the  first  was thatof Sir George  Foster.  Sir  R. Borden declared that the need  for  a  united  national government left no  room for private or personal considerations, and he was therefore prepared, to secure  that end, either to retire or to serve under  Sir George Foster.The latter expressed his belief that the Union Government wdiich. they  desired  couldonly  be satisfactorily achieved under the leadership  of Sir  Robert Borden.   Theresolution finally adopted by the  meeting concurred in the opinion that Sir robert borden&apos;s   continuance   in  the   Premiership  is  indispensable to the  nation  andunanimously  recorded  &quot; profound admiration  for his  great work  and  splendidleadership.&apos;1  The meeting &quot; endorsed the earnest  and patient  efforts of the Prime&quot; Minister to give the  Dominion the advantage of an Administration which would&quot; typifj7 the union of all the war forces  of  Canada and speak to the  world of  the&quot; unswerving resolution of our people to see  this war through to victory.&quot;    Sir Robert Borden has announced the Governments intention  to grant increasedpensions to soldiers, on a percentage basis, to compensate for the increased cost ofliving.    The new  Franchise Bill has been prepared ;  it is understood that it will restrict the franchise in the case of  persons of alien  enemy  nationality.  Sir Wilfrid Laurieris opposed to the Bill.   Parliament will probably not be prorogued for three or four weeks.    The Governor-General  signed  the  Military  Service Bill  at  Toronto  on  29thAugust.   It  became law  on the  following day.   Some  weeks  must  elapse before-measures, including the appointment of local tribunals, are completed for calling out thefirst-class.  With regard to the composition of the Board of Selection (wdiich, under theAct,  has to appoint one member to each local tribunal) Sir Robert Borden, in the  House of  Commons, invited  Sir Wilfrid  Laurier  to nominate half of  its members.  SirWilfrid replied that he considered it his  duty to accept the invitation, for the reason that, the Measure having become  law, &quot; it behoves all  good citizens to see that  it is carried out as harmoniously as possible.&quot;    The Canadian Food  Controller has informed Lord Rhondda that  the result of theprohibition to import Canadian apples into the United Kingdom is producing serious results,  particularly in Nova  Scotia.  In order that  the Canadian Authorities  may proceed  to  make arrangements for  the  distribution  of food  supplies  throughout Canada,  they require  to  be  definitely  informed  whether  this  prohibition will be relaxed and, if so, to what extent ?  The Canadian Government are informed by fruit shippers  that there is  frequently unused space available in steamers sailing from Halifax and St.  Johns  to the United Kingdom,  and  if this  is the case they fail  to tinderstand the necessity for an absolute embargo.                       AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH.    The  Australian  Government  have  urged  the  Colonial  Office  to cancel  the-arrangements made (and communicated by despatch  to  the High  Commissioner forthe Western Pacific in February last) to  license the owner of Fanning Island and washington Island to establish  and  operate  wireless  telegraph  stations in thoseislands.  The Commonwealth Government point out that a small receiving plant was&apos;installed by the Commonwealth Naval Board at  Fanning  Island in  December 1914 ;-that the cable station at this island is-of great importance to the protection  of  British
interests in the Pacific; that therefore the control of the island azid everyone residing;therein should he vested  in  the  Pacific Cable Board ; and.  that  no wireless  stations should be erected on the island unless it be controlled by that Board.  The australian government  regard the erection  of a  wireless station by a private individual  as  amatter of urgent concern  to Australia.    The Governor-General strongly urges upon  the  Imperial  Government that  theyshould purchase, upon the terms which he has  previously recommended, the copperproduced by the Electrolytic. Company,  which, in accordance  with  the expressedwishes of  the Commonwealth  Government,  is  endeavouring  to foster the  coppermining and  producing industry for purposes of the  Empire&apos;s trade.  He points outthat Australian mining and smelting companies have expended  a large amount ofcapital since the war  began in  the extension of their plant and installation of new works, and that the3^ have curtailed their  profitable  business in the East to meet the-demands  of  the Ministry of Munitions.   If, after  these efforts  and  sacrifices,  theImperial Government now refuse to purchase that portion of the copper output which.is produced by small companies and pioneering  prospectors, it will be a serious blow to the development of  mining in Australia.    Referring to the communication of the Secretary  of State for the Colonies  on thesubject of the  unrestricted  application of the  Army Act to the Australian Imperial.Force  (vide  last  Report), the Australian Government urge that it would be most unwise to endeavour to make the desired change, under existing domestic conditions,for  the reason  that  it  could not  fail to. have  an immediate  and serious effect upon recruiting,, and  would compel,  the  Government once again to take  a  popularvote  upon the  question  of conscription.   This, in  the opinion  of  the australian government, might render it impossible  to maintain the present  stream  of rein for ce-ments.  For this reason they are convinced  that,  until matters settle clown,  it is-.imperative that the question of the application of the Army Act to  the AustralianImperial Force should not be raised.  They ask  that the question be left in abeyancefor the time being, on the  understanding that it will be dealt  with at the earliestconvenient moment.    Complying with the request  of His Majesty&apos;s  Government (vide last Report)  theGovernment  of  the  Commonwealth have made  arrangements  which enable them tooffer five  cargo steamers and two combined passenger-and-cargo  vessels, diverted from the coastal  trade, for Imperial purposes connected with  the prosecution of thewar.   They point out  that this result has only been achieved  after long negotiations,and that the coastal trade will  thereby be seriously dislocated.   If  His Majesty&apos;sGovernment  accept the offer of these vessels, the Commonwealth Authorities propose.to load them with full cargoes of wheat, flour and  wool for the United Kingdom.    The Australian Government have submitted  an offer for the consideration of theFood Controller, to  sell, to His  Majesty&apos;s  Government 30,000  tons  of their surplus..produce of butter  during the next nine  months,  at a price of  149s. 4d. per  cwt.for the highest  quality.    They  also offer  all the surplus  of  Australian  cheeseproduced during the same period at Qld. per lb.,  this price to be dependent, however,..on the prices paid for similar New Zealand and Canadian produce.                               NEW ZEALAND.    The 12,000,000L War  Loan issued at par at 4^-  per cent, interest, free of taxation,,has been locally over-subscribed by 3,500,000L    The Government have sanctioned the arrangements giving six  months&apos; leave fromthe front, including Egypt,  (which will  allow  two  months in New Zealand) to all members of the Expeditionary Force who have completed three years&apos; service.  Thosewho do not wish  to  return  to New Zealand will  be granted two  months&apos; leave ofabsence in  England or France.   The number of men  now entitled to benefit  by this measure is 1,500.   Reinforcements are being provided to replace  them at  the front.The New  Zealand  Government hope that the Imperial  authorities  will raise noobjection.    Replying  to the enquiry of the New Zealand  Government, the Secretary of State-for the Colonies has informed the Governor-General that the Committee  appointed toconsider the question of  an Imperial trade policy (which is not  a  parliamentary committee, but a Committee of Ministers), will be  authorised to deal with questions relating to overseas shipping.  The Dominion  Government have  asked to  be kept informed of the progress of the Committee.
    Serious difficulty lias arisen with, regard to the exportation of  butter.  The  PrimeMinister is of opinion  that  unless  His Majesty&apos;s Government  can take steps  to requisition it in the same way as they have requisitioned cheese, the industry will beruined.                               SOUTH  APP1CA.    The Wool Grower&apos;s Conference at De Aar  passed  a resolution on 30th Augustagainst the  purchase of the clip  by the Imperial Government,  on the ground thatfarming implements have risen 100 per cent, in price, and that the  wool farmer willbe subjected to an unfair  special  and indirect tax.  The resolution demanded &quot; free and unmolested trade.&quot;  The Minister of Agriculture, Mr. van Heerden, said that the,Union Government  was endeavouring to obtain better  terms,  but he declined onbehalf of the Cabinet to accept responsibility for advising farmers one way or theother.   Another conference would  be held at Bloemfontein,  when  the farmers would decide for themselves.  According to Press reports, the agitation against acceptanceof the  terms offered by the Imperial Government (see last Report) is being largelyworked up by the Nationalist Party from political motives.    The Union Government reports that some 180 out  of  400  convicts  who  havevolunteered for service overseas are physically fit, but  considers  that it would create the worst possible impression in  South Africa if they  were accepted for militaryservice.   It suggests that  they might be  engaged for munition work, but that even then they should be sent to England in  different ships from those carrying military reinforcements.                           BRITISH  EAST   AFRICA.    In view of the unsettled state of affairs in Abyssinia, the War Office have sanctionedthe despatch of part of the 1st  Battalion, 6th  Kings  African Rifles,.to the Turkanacountry to check any disturbances  likely to arise from  incursions over the Abyssinianborder.  The battalion in question consists mainly of ex-German Askaris.                           G ERMAN  EAST  AFRICA.    In view of the proximity of German raiding  columns  to Wilhelmstal, the civiladministrative headquarters of the occupied territory, the Administrator has  pointedout to General van  Deventer the  detrimental  effect upon  the  native  population, aswell  as upon the enemy,  of the capture  or isolation of  Wilhelmstal,  or of  itsevacuation  by the  civilian  authorities.   General van  Deventer  is consequentlyincreasing the forces stationed at Wilhelmstal and is taking steps  to clear  the  wholeTanga-Moshi area of enemy columns.                                  HONG KONG.    In view of the exceptional rise in the value of  silver, the unofficial Members of theCouncil have requested the. Governor to  recommend to His M.ajesty&apos;s Government.thatthe pay of  naval and military  establishments  should  be converted into dollars at a fixed rate of 2s.,  to take  effect from 1st July last.  The expenditure involved wouldbe at the rate of about 30,000 dollars monthly. The unofficial Members of  theCouncil suggest that, if the Admiralty  and War Office are not  prepared  to sanctionthis  expenditure, the Colony will defray it  during   the  period  of the  wrar.   TheGovernor, while supporting their recommendation, points out that  if the principle is adopted the naval and  military authorities must be  prepared  to maintain it afterthe war.                                    LIBERIA.    The Liberian Government have offered Liberia as a naval base during  the war inreturn  for  the protection  promised  them  by His Majesty&apos;s   Government  against german aggression.3S97-1B
PART  II.-FOREIGN AFFAIRS.                        ALLIED  COMMON  AFFAIRS.   Sir G. Buchanan reported on 1 st September that M. Kerensky is of opinion thatthe Allies should accelerate the meeting of the Allied Conference originally proposedto be held in September (vide Report No. 26).  He thinks it advisable that representa-tives of the Allies  should meet to discuss the general situation without making any public announcement of their convocation, or of the purposes for which  the meeting is -convened.  The Minister  for  Foreign Affairs, who had previously held the opinionthat  it would be well to postpone the Conference until Russi.a&apos;s position became oneof more authority, now concurs in thinking that a Conference  might be held early inOctober ;  it should have the  character of one of the ordinary Allied Conferences, atwhich  Russia  would  be  represented.  Sir  G. Buchanan  has  been  instructed(4th  September) to state  that His Majesty&apos;s Government  agree to the proposal andwill  be ready,  to join in a  discussion whenever the Russian Government can sendrepresentative Ministers to take part therein.   With reference to the agreement recently concluded  by the  Russian government at Stockholm,  whereby Sweden receives 20,000 tons of oil cake,  His Majesty&apos;sGovernment  have directed  Sir G.  Buchanan (31st August)  to impress  upon  theRussian  Government the extreme  importance  of restricting  as  far  as possible  all exports to Scandinavia  and Holland,  or, in other words, of  nothing being done  byany of the Allies  to  diminish the effect of the blockade policy now being enforcedupon neutrals by the United States.   As regards Sweden,  in particular, the need  fora  common policy and united  action is clearly  indicated, in  view of the  swedish governments expressed determination to maintain commercial relations with Germany,and because, by making American pressure  effective, it is hoped  to obtain full  and free   transit  for Russian-owned goods through Sweden.  In this connection, HisAiajesty&apos;s Government  have notified their  representatives in Scandinavia, Holland,Russia, Italy and Portugal of the scope and intentions of the United States prohibitionof exports, which makes  the export of all  kinds of goods  subject  to  licence, andintimated that  there will probably be no licences issued for Scandinavia or Holland.   Referring to the proposed joint action by the Allies  to bring pressure to  bear  on neutral banks  and  financial institutions  to deter  them from rendering financialservices  to the  enemy (vide Report No. 29), Sir E. Howard has expressed the opinion,in a letter to Lord Hardinge, that the procedure outlined by His Majesty&apos;s Governmentshould prove extremely efficacious in  solving the Allies&apos; blockade difficulties.   he considers that in financial pressure of the kind  proposed lies  the  key to the entireEuropean situation, and that the fear of a financial, boycott to be imposed by a leagueof nations would  go far towards preventing Avar in the future.   The  Italian  Government  have  appointed  Vice-Admiral  Cusani  and  CaptainLovatelli to attend  the  Naval  Conference, convened  at the suggestion of  the United States Government,  to meet in London on the  4th of September.    The  RussianGovernments  representatives are Admiral.  Kedrov  and  Captain &apos;  Schultz.   TheJapanese  Government  were  invited on 30th  August to  appoint delegates  to  theConference.                                    FRANCE.    The  French  Press continues to  discuss the Duval-Almereyda  affairs,  and to publish  further  disclosures  concerning Germany&apos;s methods  of  corrupt penetration in connection  therewith.  The  li Liberte &quot;  asserts  that  an  enquiry instituted by M. Briand&apos;s Ministry revealed the fact that large sums of money had been paid into a well-known Paris Bank through a Germanophil Bank in America, and that other funds were passed through France to Italy for the purposes of Germany&apos;s propaganda. M. Herve in &quot; La  Victoire &quot; calls on  the  Government to publish the memorandum of funds received  by Almereyda, which he handed over to  the authorities before his  imprisonment.   Public opinion generally realises  the danger arising from  the
  corrupt schemes of Germany&apos;s friends  and agents in France, which aim at creating  internal dissensions, and precipitating a  political crisis.   M. Serve has definitely  stated in &quot; La Victoire &quot;  that M. Caillaux&apos;s name figures  in the list of subscribers to  the &quot; Bonnet Rouge,&quot; for an amount of 40,000 francs.      On 1st September M. Malvy, Minister of the  Interior, resigned.  In a letter to  M. Ribot he announced his decision to resume the liberty of a private citizen in order  to face and  confound his calumniators.   The comments of the French Press upon  his resignation reflected the nervous restlessness of  party politics  in France, hut,  generally speaking, the fallen  Minister  received full credit for disinterested services  rendered to. the State during the past three years.  The &quot; Figaro &quot; observed that he  was the dupe, not  the accomplice, of those who &quot; in  the  dark, close beside him, took  &quot; advantage  of his blindness and  betrayed France.  His  successor must  not  be  &quot; be representative of that system.&quot;   M. Herve  said, that M.  Malvy had paid the  penalty for the weakness which he  displayed towards the Paciiist  propaganda, but-  his services at the  Ministry of the Interior deserve to be gratefully remembered.   To  this he added the characteristic  touch :  &quot; Clemenceau has deprived us of the  services  &quot; of Malvy.   That does  not matter, provided the Lord or the devil preserves us from  &quot; the services of Clemenceau.&quot;      After  the resignation of the Minister of  the  Interior, a  member of  the  French  Cabinet told Lord  Bertie that the position of  the  Government haddoeen irretrievably  damaged  by the  Duval-Almereyda  disclosures, that M. Maginot and Viviani would  have to retire, and that a reconstruction of the Cabinet  would be extremely difficult.  On the same day the Minister of War,  in  the course  of a confidential conversation,  -expressed the opinion that the  only result  of  M.  Clemenceau&apos;s campaign would be to -unsettle  the public mind and  disturb the  political, atmosphere; he  was a  purely  destructive force and incapable of succeeding M. Ribot as President of the Council  without precipitating a crisis.      On 4th  September Lord Bertie  reported that M.  Malvy might  be succeeded as  Minister of  the Interior  by M. Pams, an honest, straightforward  man who was  a  candidate  for  the  Presidency when  M.  Poincare  was  elected.   Meanwhile  the  &quot;Bonnet  Rouge&quot;  plot  continues  to thicken.  A former  President of the  Council,  M. Combes,  is reported  to have contributed 1,G00L to the funds of this paper, and,  as he is a poor man, people are asking where the money came from.  In &quot; La Victoire,&quot;  of the 4th September, M. Herve enquires why Bolo  Pasha  (the intimate friend of  M. Oaillaux) who  has long been accused  of  intercourse with the enemy, is still at  large,  and who are his protectors ?   He declares  that  Bolo put 51- million, francs into  the &quot;Journal&quot; by an  agreement made  in  January  1916; and he calls upon  the  Government to prevent German propaganda from making of France another Russia.  M. Humbert, of the  Journal,&quot; admits  having accepted Bolo&apos;s   money (giving him a  share  in  the profits but no voice in the control of the paper) on the assurance of &quot; a  person highly qualified by his functions to serve as guarantor.&quot;   He also admits that  in February last Bolo was accused of intercourse  with the enemy, on the ground that  he had cashed three cheques, of 750,000 francs each, delivered  by the Kaiser to the  ex-Khedive  for   the  organisation  of   pacifist  propaganda  in  Allied  countries. - M. Humbert now  blames the authorities for not investigating the charges against  Bolo who, in his opinion; ought to have been absolved or shot months ago.                                     BELGIUM.      Concurring in the view of the French Government, that it is desirable  to determine  forth with  a basis of monthly expenditure for fixing the duration, of  the sixth joint  loan to Belgium, the Treasury have  now suggested that  the monthly figure should be  70 million francs,  subject to a revision of  their estimate if the French Government so  desire.  As the fifth joint loan of 500 million francs covered Belgian  expenditure for  nearly six  months,  besides  providing 112,500,000  francs  for relief purposes, the  Treasury consider their estimate, if  anything, too  high, especially as the United States  Government may  be expected, to  provide Belgium with credits sufficient to cover  Belgian expenditure in America.                                       ITALY.      Sir R. Rodd has pointed  out that the measures  adopted last year by the Italian   Government, to prohibit the free export of oranges to  Switzerland, were only rendered   possible  by the fact that His Majesty&apos;s Government assumed  financial liability as
regards the disposal of the surplus crop.  In framing their  prohibition (whereby thewhole  machinery of the regular export  trade  has been suspended), the  italian authorities have assumed that this would hold good for the duration of the war.  HisMajesty&apos;s Ambassador advises that if  His  Majesty&apos;s  Government are unable to assist in the  disposal of the surplus  of  the  crop this  season,  notice of  the fact should begiven  without delay, in winch  case  he regards  the resumption of free export as inevitable.  Last year&apos;s  export of oranges  from Italy amounted to about &quot;2,000,000cases,  containing on. an  average  300  oranges each ;  this year&apos;s exportable surplus isestimated  to  be  smaller, and  the Italian  Ministry  of   Commerce is organising  an association of commercial firms to dispose  of as  much of  the fruit as possible forconsumption by their workmen.                                     GREECE.    The Greek Government are uneasy concerning the  attitude of King Alexander,whose general  behaviour lends  colour to  the  belief that he  still  regards  himselfmerely as a locum tenens for his father, believing in the ultimate victory of Germany.During his recent visit to Salonika  he declined  an invitation to  meet the  PrinceRegent of Serbia and the British and French  Commanders-in-Chief at dinner, and upon his return to Athens announced, to his  Council  of  Ministers  that  he  wished  tomarry  Miss Manos (vide Report No. 29).   The  Council  of  Ministers  declined  to sanction this proposal.    Plis Majesty&apos;s  Government have authorised Mr.  Crackanthorpe to  assent to  the revised agreement ,  drafted by the Greek  Minister for  Foreign Affairs, with  regardto  the  constitution of the  Indemnities Commission  (vide  last  Report),  on  theunderstanding that Mr. Crackanthorpe and  his French colleague are  agreed as to itsacceptability.   Judge Thorne was therefore instructed to take up his  duties, andthe Commission  held its first official sitting on the  3rd of September.    The  evacuation  of Epirus by the Italian and French  forces appears to  be  inprocees of satisfactory arrangement.   On 29th August  the Italian Minister informedM. Venizelos that the Italian troops were about to withdraw, and that, the reinstatementof  the Greek  civil  authorities would take  place  simultaneously  with  the  militaryevacuation.  At  the same time General Sarrail announced that Thessaly  had been completely evacuated by French  troops, and that the small  garrison at Prevesa wasabout to be withdrawn.  On 31st August Sir R. Rodd.  reported that Baron  Sonninohad telegraphed instructions to  the  Italian Minister at Athens to the effect that, if general Sarrail was unwilling to  agree to the plan  for  joint  evacuation proposed bythe Italian General  at Valeria,  the representatives of  the protecting  Powers should draw  up a plan in concert with the Greek  Government.   He was anxious for a speedysolution  of the  question, apprehending the danger  of  friction between local  militaryauthorities.   The French troops, it seems, have  occupied a post  within the  Epirustriangle, where the Italians control the road ; Baron  Sounino  desires to see this postwithdrawn as soon as possible, but has no objection to the French remaining in controlof the line from  Itea.  On  4th September  the  Italian Consul  at Janina  telegraphedto the Minister at Athens that the Italian troops, with the exception of  two battalions,.had already evacuated the town.   On the same day Idis Majesty&apos;s Consul at Janina con- firmed, this report and added that all  French troops had been withdrawn from Prevesa and from all posts between Prevesa and Janina.  The Greek Governor-General of Epirushad arrived at Prevesa.   The Greek Government are still perturbed, however, by the presence of the large Italian garrison  in Corfu,  and  by  their  continued activities, as displayed in placing a guard at the Post and Telegraph Office.    Mr. Crackanthorpe reports that the powers to be  assigned by the Greek Goverment to the British Naval Arission will be on the same footing as  those to  be conferred on the French Military Mission.  Captain Clifton Brown, the designated head  of  the British Mission, is now in the  Aegean, and will visit Athens about the middle of September before  returning to  England to  complete  the composition   of  his mission.    With reference to the impending modifications  in Port Control (vide last Report), the- Italian Minister at Athens has received instructions  to claim the control at Patras and Prevesa for  Italy,  together  with co-operation in control at  other ports (e.g., Syra) where  the  Italian Government may&apos; consider it  necessary.   Mr.  Crackanthorpe, approached on the  subject by the Italian  Minister, suggested that the question should be reserved  for discussion  with the newly  arrived  French  Minister,  who (on
3rd September) expressed the opinion that all political controls had  been abolished,that the existing port control was a naval and not a political arrangement, and there-fore a matter for discussion,  in case of need, between the Greek Government and theBritish and French Naval Authorities.    Upon the advice of Sir It. Wingate, who reports that the Egyptian authorities are opposed to the  immigration of  Salonika Jews (vide last  Report) His Majesty&apos;sGovernment have instructed Air. Crackanthorpe  that  any tendency in this directionis to be discouraged.    M.   Venizelos  has  drawn the attention of  Mr.  Crackanthorpe to  the  critical situation  of the  wheat supply,  pointing  out  that  the  success of  his militaryplans  depends chiefly  on the  satisfactory solution  of this  urgent  problem  and upon the possibility of increasing the bread ration from  $ to f  lb.   For an  army of  200,000 men,  the  monthly  quota  of  wheat  required  is  2,500  tons,  besideswhich  stocks for military purposes must  be provided  at  various  places,  and  tocreate  a reserve against inevitable losses of steamer-cargoes.   The present supply, onthe existing ration basis, will last only to 5th October, and the next three cargoes duecannot arrive  before the  end of October.   To tide over this  interval, arrangements must be made for 7,000 tons of  wheat to reach Greece before  5th October and  two more cargoes before the 18th,  The Allied Board at Athens estimate that the  normal requirements of Greece must be raised to  310,000 tons, more  or  less, depending onthe yield of the maize  crops, in  other words, supplies  must reach  Greece  at the rateof 800  tons  a  day,  not  including provision  of  the  necessary reserve stocks.   TheGreek Governments  tonnage   available  for  transport  of these  supplies is  quite inadequate.  M.  Venizelos points  out that Greece, as an  Ally, deserves more liberaltreatment than she  is  receiving in this matter,  especialby in  view of the fact that alarge portion of  Greek tonnage  has been requisitioned for the service of the Allies.                                   ALBANIA.   Information from Albanian sources has been received through  Berne to  the  effectthat the Greeks intend to seize Moslem  property in Southern Albania as  reprisal forthe destruction of Greek property by the  Turks in Asia Minor.   His Majesty&apos;s repre-sentative  at  Athens has  been  instructed  to  mention  these  reports  to the GreekMinister for Foreign Affairs, and to point out that, if such action were taken, it couldnot fail to complicate the question of Italy&apos;s evacuation of Albania.  It would leavethe Turks indifferent, while providing them with a pretext for further reprisals.                                    SERBIA.   In  a Memorandum dated 14th August, the Serbian  Prime Minister, M. Pashitch,urges the immediate shortening of the Serbian Front  at Salonika, pointing out that  itis already the longest in proportion to the strength  of the Serbian  Army,  and that owing  to  the continual exertions of the Serbian Army  since they reached Salonika,numerous cases of heart trouble, suicide,  and  other  signs of demoralisation  have begun  to  occur.  Further,  in order to  reinforce the  Serbian Army,  the  SerbianGovernment have requested :     (a)  The  Russian Government to send to  the Salonika  front the Serbian Volunteer          Corps, 20,000 men strong, which is  at present at the  Russian  front in          Rumania ;   (b)  The  Government of the United States to send  to the Salonika front an  Army          Corps, composed of Southern Slavs living in the United States, which  would          be under American command ;   (c)  The  Italian Government to liberate those Southern Slav prisoners  of war, who          are anxious to join the Serbian Army.   The Serbian Government appeal  to His  Majesty&apos;s  Government to support  theserequests,  the fulfilment of  wdiich would reinforce  the  Serbian Army by 50,000 to00,000 men.     3S97-1                             C
   M. Pashitch considers tliat, in order to achieve better accord between different.armies on the Salonika  Front  and the  General Headquarters  of the Allied  Forces.there, an Allied General Staff should be created, to which representatives of  all the-armies  should be attached.  With  regard to the Serbian prisoners of war, whosecondition is reported to be desperate, M.  Pashitch requests the Allied  governments to take over their maintenance, and to help them as they would their own prisoners ;otherwise they will be exterminated.  He  points out  that  the credit  of  seven and a half million francs granted  a year ago by  the  Allied GoATernments for  clothing and food  for Serbian prisoners of war  has  not yet been used, owing  to  differences ofopinion between the members of. the Commission to which its disbursement has  beenconfided.   Lastly, M. Pashitch requests  that  Serbia.be invited to take part  in any negotiations for peace which may hereafter-arise with the Central Powers.    With reference to these requests, the Foreign Office note that arrangements for trans-f erring the Serbian troops in Russia are already in progress. With regard to the SouthernSlavs in the United States, the main difficulty is one of  tonnage.  On the other hand,with  regard to the Southern Slav prisoners in Austria,  the Italian Government haveshown  no readiness  to  further the  project.  The Foreign&apos;  Office consider that theconstitution  of a joint Military Council  for  the  Salonika Army  might offer anopportunity for approaching the French  again with regard  to  the whole position ofGeneral Sarrail.  It would  be difficult for the French to refuse such  a  suggestion ifput forward by.all the Allies, and the institution of  such a Council would probablycarry with it the automatic  resignation of General Sarrail.    As  to the  condition of the Serbian  prisoners, the Foreign Office admit that thearrangements which were made to share the  responsibility for  the provision of theirfood and  clothing between us and  the  French have not  worked satisfactorily, and consider that the Treasury might be induced to increase the sum now being  paidto the  Serbian Relief Fund,  the French  Government  on their  side increasing theresponsibility for one half of the total of Serbian  prisoners now in enemy countries.With regard  to the Serbian  demand to be allowed to  take part in  Peace  Negotiations,the Foreign Office suggest  that it might  be  possible for the Allies  to  join in some such formula as follows :  &quot; The Allied Governments desire to  assure Serbia that in&quot; any negotiations which may be entered into  with  the  enemy powers,  they will not&quot; commit themselves to any  decision with regard to   Serbian interests,  until  the&quot; Serbian Government have been consulted  and have  been given an opportunity of&quot; expressing their views.&quot;   In this connection the Serbian Government,  through their Minister in London,have  also proposed  that the  facts  be investigated  by  an Allied Commission, and requested the Allied  Governments to take  immediate steps to that end, as a matter of urgency.   On 5th September the Foreign  Office  telegraphed  to  Sir  C.  Spring Rice for his views as to whether the  United States would assist in  the  formation  of  the proposedAmerican Jugoslav   contingent,  and as to  the numbers  likely to be  available.  Atelegram was also sent on the same date  to Sir R. Rodd  requesting him to approach the Italian Government  officially and urge them  to  give  immediate and favourableattention to the proposal for releasing Jugoslav prisoners for service  in the  SerbianArmy.   Sir  C. des  Graz  reports (4th September) that  the  Acting Minister for ForeignAffairs has observed a conciliatory change  of  attitude on the part of the  bulgarian government  towards Serbia, and the Bulgarian Red  Cross   have  intimated  their readiness  to recognise the Serbian Red Cross.                              GERMAN  AFFAIRS.   In the &quot; Vorwarts &quot; of 2nd September, Herr David declares that  the only chance-for the Anexationists  to get  their way would be for a dissolution of the Reichstag andan election in which, the  majority of  the people supported them.  If such an  electionresulted in the return of the present Reichstag majority, the course  upon which theship of state is to be guided would be finally decided.  In such  an election the parties.which compose the majority would have to come  together as one, in order to  be ableto prove  that the bulk of  the  people  is  behind them in favour of &quot; A peace byunderstanding&quot; and  a  new  system  of liberty at  home.   He  further  urges  that soldiers in the field should be allowed to  vote.
                             AUSTRIAN  AFFAIRS.                                  I   The Acting British Consul-General at Zurich  reports the substance of conversa-tions between the Emperor Charles and a freedance German Professor called Forsterwhich took place in July.  According to Professor Forster the Emperor expressed his conviction that the Monarchy could ordy be  saved by radical measures on the lines of democracy and federation.   A  great confederation, based  on  the right  of the con-stituent peoples to decide upon their own fate, must be setup, freed from subserviencyto Prussian military ideals, and serving as a  counterpoise to Germany.  The historicboundaries must fall, both within and without the frontiers of  the Monarchy, so as toenable a  united Serbia,  a united Roumania, and a satisfied  Bohemia to  come into existence the  idea  being apparently  that  the  existing  Serbian and  Roumaniankingdoms should enter the new federation  much as Bavaria and Saxony entered theGerman Empire.  Polish autonomy must be  secured wdiile, apparently, the Trentinoand  Gorizia,  but not Trieste or Dalmatia, might be ceded  to Itahy.  Idle pressure ofthe Entente,  by helping to bring about these readjustments,  might, in the end, prove ablessing in disguise.                                SWITZERLAND.    His Majesty&apos;s Government have instructed  Sir  H. Rumbold to obtain  immediate and explicit assurances from the Swiss  Government on the subject of the export  ofSwdss munitions, so that His  Majesty&apos;s Government may be definitely satisfied  thatthe Allies are receiving [treatment in all  respects as favourable as that accorded  toGermany.   If such  assurances are  not forthcoming without delay, His Majesty&apos;sGovernment will take a very grave view of the situation and proceed to discuss withthe Allies such steps as may be considered necessary.    As recorded  in last week&apos;s  Report, the German-Swiss Convention  is held up,owing to the unwillingness  of  the Swiss Banks to handle the proposed German  loanin connection therewith, unless assured that they  will not be deprived of cable andpostal facilities  by the Allies.   Sir H.  Rumbold. was authorised on 30th August  tointimate to the Swiss Government and  Banks that no such retaliatory measures willbe adopted, provided that facilities are given for leans to the Allies, at least equal  totheir aggregate  to the  amount of the loan to  Germany.  The British  and french governments will  require  such facilities,  and are now consulting as  to the best methods of procedure for floating loans.  In  this connection, His  Majesty&apos;s minister has been instructed  to  remind the Swiss Authorities that  German credit does not stand  on the same  footing  as British, and  that equality of treatment cannot  beregarded as implying equality of interest charges, &amp;c.                                   SWEDEN.   In a recent despatch  Sir E. Howard  referred  to the  increasing bitterness of the electoral campaign.   The  chief  issues  before the  electors are  (1) the  economicsituation, and (2) the struggle for constitutional and genuine  Parliamentary Govern-ment.   The Conservatives&apos; principal argument is  that if  Mr. Branting is returned to power  this  will mean war with Germany, which the  Socialists  energetically deny.It is expected  that the  Socialist  majority&apos; will  be considerably increased, but the conservatives hope that, if so, their gains will be at  the  expense of the Liberals.The King is reported to  have said that he would sooner abdicate than see Mr. BrantingPrime Minister.   Sir E.  Howard thinks that the  eventual result of the elections maybe a Coalition Government in wdiich the  Socialists will be represented.    On 29th August  the  Prime  Minister  made  a speech dealing with the economicsituation as regards foodstuffs,  and incidentally defending the agricultural policy ofthe Government,  wdiich has  aroused  much hostility  among  farmers.  He said,amongst other things, that owing to the lack of fodder it would be necessary to exporta large number of cattle and  horses.   A licence to export  5,000 beef carcases to finland and Norway was granted  to the Farmers&apos; Association  on the 28th August.The question of  prohibiting the export of  live stock from Sweden is under  discussion between His&apos; Majesty&apos;s  Government  and the Russian  Government.  The Russian
Minister at, Stockholm has been negotiating with a view to securing their prohibition,in return for supplies of oil cake and  fuel oil, but on  3rd September His Majesty&apos;sGovernment  instructed Sir E. Howard that further action in the matter  should  be deferred pending the conclusion of the negotiations now proceeding  between sweden and the United  States.  With  regard  to  these, Sir C. Spring  Rice reported  on 30thAugust that &quot;the Swedish delegate had informed  the United States  Government that sweden is bound by her commercial treaty of 1911 to export iron ore to Germany, aswell as by contracts entered into by mines under  the  direct  control  of the swedish government.  The Foreign Office, in reply,  have pointed out that  this argument is obviously a  subterfuge (inasmuch as it would apply  equally to  many other articleswdiose export Sweden has prohibited) and hope that the  United  State&apos;s Governmentwill treat it as such.    The Swedish Government have applied to  His Majesty&apos;s Minister for facilities to import a quantity of cork for the construction of public refrigerators.   In view  of thefact that Germany is in no present need  of meat, His Majesty&apos;s Government  are ofopinion that an3&apos; cold storage depot constructed in  Sweden might  be used to preservemeat  for  the time wdien Germany requires it  hereafter.  They therefore  propose torefuse the facilities for importing cork.   The matter has been under dismission withthe United  States Government, who  have  expressed concurrence with, the policy ofHis Majesty&apos;s Government.    According to information  from a trustworthy source, Sweden&apos;s stocks  of  mineraloils are at present exhausted ;  a certain  quantity is reported  to have been imported from Russia, but the Swedish Government refuse to supply statistics  of such imports.His Majesty&apos;s Government have  directed  Sir C.  Spring  Rice to suggest that theUnited States Government should continue to refuse licences for  oil shipments to sweden unless these statistics are forthcoming, and unless Sweden concedes certaincompensating advantages (e.g., tonnage) to the Allies.                                   NORWAY.    Anticipating the  possibility that Norway may be  forced,  either  by the blockadepressure of the Allies or by impossible demands from Germany, to enter  the war  onthe side of the Allies, His Majesty&apos;s Government have  directed Sir C. Spring  Rice toinform the United States Government  of  the  facts of  the  situation,  and to ask them whether  they are prepared to  give a general  assurance that they wdll render naval assistance to Norway in the event  of her  being  attacked  by Germany.  The british naval Staff, who have  made plans to meet the eventuality, are anxious to know thenature and  extent  of the assistance which the United States naval  authorities areprepared to give, and the Naval Conference now sitting should afford an opportunityfor discussing the whole question.  Sir C.  Spring Rice, replying on the 4th, states  onthe authority of  Mr. Lansing that the President is distinctly in favour of United states naval co-operation.    Sir M. Findlay,  regarding the question of  the Allied blockade  in the light  of thesituation as it exists in Norway and with a view of inflicting the  maximum of  injuryupon  the enemy,  reiterates his opinion  that Norway cannot possibly continue tosupply Germany unless  she receives grain,  oil, and  materials  from America.  he therefore considers  that the only possible policy for the United States to  adopt, witha view to shortening the war, is  a policy of &quot; no imports for Norway unless  all exportsto Germany cease.&quot;                                   DENMARK.    The  prospects  of  DenmarlPs  coming  to  any  satisfactory arrangement with the United States Exports&apos; Board, as theresrdt of the special Danish Mission&apos;s negotiations at Washington,  have  been seriously jeopardised by the intractable  attitude  of the danish delegates, which  has caused no little irritation.   They have antagonised the United States authorities from the outset by declining to give   any information inregard to existing stocks in Denmark  or exports to Germany.    Two Representatives of the Ministry of Food have been instructed to  proceed toCopenhagen to negotiate a comprehensive agreement for the  purchase  of Danishbacon and butter on  behalf of His Majesty&apos;s  Government.   The prices which theywill be authorised to offer will be partly payable in the form of  a bonus, to be deposited in London until the end of the war.
    An official report of the recent naval affair between British destroyers and German trawlers off Bjerregaard, communicated to Mr. Gurney on 1st September by the Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs  appeared to  the latter to justify the conclusion that shots had  been fired  within  territorial waters.  d&apos;he Danish Government have instructed their Minister in London to lodge a formal protest against  the violation  of&quot;territory.   An official communique sent to Mr.  Gurney by the Danish Foreign Office on 4th September states  that an enquiry is  proceeding to ascertain whether  the Germans, by continuing to fight in territorial  waters, also violated  Danish territory. It adds that all persons belonging to the  German Navy who have landed  will be interned.                                     SPAIN.    On 1st September the Foreign Office informed Sir A. Hardinge that their negotiations with the  Spanish Ambassador in the matter of the Cortina agreement  had made satisfactory progress, the Spanish  Government having agreed to use Spanish ships for the  transport  of  coal from the  United  Kingdom  to  Spain.   As  the  arrangement concluded on this basis allows Spain to import a quantity of  British coal sufficient for all her requirements, His Majesty&apos;s Government have proposed that no coal shall, be exported  from  Spain except with their consent.  The question of allowing a fixed maximum of Spanish coal to be exported for  the  use  of  Spanish ships remains for further discussion.  The basis on which  the fruit  exports to Great Britain are to be regulated has been referred to the Board of Trade.   As regards the export of iron ore, pyrites, and other metals, the Spanish Government will allow these to continue under the  conditions  at present  in force,  in accordance with actual legislation and  the procedure obtaining in 1914.                                  PORTUGAL.    A strike of postal and telegraph employes was declared at Lisbon on 1st September, despite the fact that a decree, published on the previous day, had increased their pay. The  Government have declared the strikers mobilised under martial law.  Most of the employes refused to work,  and  have  been arrested.  The  strike  extends  to  Oporto and Coimbra, and the inland telegraph, service is practically  at a standstill.                                     CHINA.  ,    The British and French Governments  are agreed that, although, the Japanese proposals (vide Report No. 29) in regard to the advantages to be conceded to China in consideration of  her entering  the war  are less favourable  than those originally contemplated,  they offer  a sound basis  for  discussion.   The French Government have authorised their Minister at Peking to open negotiations with his Allied colleagues so as to arrive at  a  common draft agreement; they wish it  to  be understood at the outset that  any  increase in China&apos;s import tariff must  be conditional  upon the abolition of lekin dues.  As to the changes which the Japanese Government desire to introduce into the classification of goods for payment of duties, the French Govern- in eht reserve  their attitude and  consider that the question  should be  dealt  with separately, after an exchange of views between the Allied Governments interested.    A meeting  of the Allied representatives was  held  at Peking on 1st  September,- and  it was decided  to reply to the Chinese Government (who  had expressed a desire to resume negotiations), setting  forth the Allies&apos; general proposals  in regard to the tariff, &amp;c, and  describing ceitain measures which the Chinese Government slxrald take, in  their own interest, with regard  to  the  ex-German  ships  and settlements. Mr.  Alston reported  that the Russian  and  Italian Ministers  had  not yet  received instructions on the subject of  the  proposed suspension  of  the Boxer  indemnity payments.  His Majesty&apos;s  Government have instructed their Ambassadors at Petrograd and  Rome (4th September) to emphasise.the advisability of  expediting these negotia- tions, and to express the hope that the Russian and Italian Ministers at Peking may speedily  be instructed to adhere to the terms  agreed to by their British, French, and Japanese colleagues.    The  Japanese  Ambassador,  having  communicated to  the  Foreign  Office   a Memorandum on the internal  situation in China advocating support of  the Central Government  and the  withholding  of assistance  from its  opponents, His Majesty&apos;s      3897-1                               D
 Government have expressed their concurrence in this policy as the best means of restoring order in China, and  have notified the French, Italian, Russian and  United States Governments accordingly.    The Chinese Cabinet  having definitely decided, to charter the ex-German  and Austrian vessels to Chinese subjects, who will be allowed to sub-charter them to the Allies, His  Majesty&apos;s Government  propose,  subject to agreement with the  United States, to endeavour to arrange that one-third of the, ex-enemy tonnage shall be sub- chartered to Great Britain ; as for the remaining two-thirds, they propose to leave it to the United States Government to consider and determine  how it should be sub- chartered, and what proposal for a share should be made to the Japanese Government and upon what terms.  His Majesty&apos;s Government have instructed Sir C. Spring Rice to suggest to the State Department  that  they should  direct  their representatives at Peking and Tokio to take  immediate action  in  accordance  with any decision arrived at  by the United States  Government.   His Majesty&apos;s Government trust that,  in deciding as  to the employment of these vessels, the urgency of the  tonnage situation in  European waters  may be  borne in mind.    In this  connection His  Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at  Tokio reported on the 2nd September  that the Japanese Government (regarding it as certain that China will not agree to sell these vessels, but will only charter  them) are prepared to  accept one-third of the  ships  thus  chartered,  but refuse, here as in Siam, to  admit any restrictions as to the uses to which they will put the tonnage thus chartered.    His Majesty&apos;s Government  learn that the Chinese Ministry of  War  is seriously considering the question of employing Chinese troops in Europe, and  has unofficially expressed a desire to know whether the idea is practicable  and would  meet with the approval of the Allied  Governments.  The attitude of the Japanese Military represen- tative at Peking appears to be favourable to this scheme, provided that the money and munitions required are supplied by the Allies.   Mr. Alston  reported  on the 3rd September that  the Chinese Government have requested that safe-conducts be  granted not only to German  and Austrian Consular officials but  to  merchants and  other civilians who .may wish to return home or to proceed to neutral countries.   The United States Minister at Peking thinks that  not more than one shipload of enemy subjects, in addition  to  the official  party, will be sanctioned by the American Government.   It is  the  opinion  of  the Allied  represen- tatives  at  Peking that  the more enemy  subjects  are deported  from China,  the better. -   His Majesty&apos;s Consul-General at Shanghai reports  that a considerable number of enemy subjects  have  recently transferred  their  accounts from  the  German Bank tothe Netherland Trading Society, the only neutral Bank in Shanghai  since China&apos;s declaration of war.  He recommends that he be authorised  to notify the manager ofthis  Dutch. Bank that,  unless he closes these enemy accounts within a reasonable time, his branches in China will be placed  on  the Black List.   The Bank  could  not afford to incur this penalty, and would  therefore be compelled  to withdraw facilitiesfrom  enemy subjects, to their serious inconvenience.                                    JAPAN.   As further evidence of the results of the American embargo on the export of steel, His Majesty&apos;s representative at Tokio reported on the 31st August, that the Japanese Government  are seriously considering  the question  of controlling  freight  rates and charters and  appear  disposed to undertake a general control  of shipping.  Japaneseshipowners are  much  alarmed  at the prospect  and, as their influence  in political circles is  very great,  Sir C. Greene considers  that  the United States Government- will need to display insistent  firmness in this matter, so as to support the movementof public opinion in Japan and the Japanese Government in initiating  the  necessary legislation.   Sir E. Howard reported on  the 1st September  that a considerable -number of japanese in Sweden were busily buying tip pig iron and steel in large quantities.   Commenting on the pessimistic reports forwarded  to  Tokio by  the  Japanese Ambassador at Petrograd, in regard  to the condition of affairs in Russia, the Ministerfor Foreign Affairs has expressed to Sir  C. Greene his  opinion that,  for the present,the only help  which the Allies  can give Russia is financial, and  in  this directionJapan is doing, and will continue to  do, her best in the  way  of giving  Russia  credit for further supplies.
   Referring  to  the proposals recently pnt forward by his Government (vide Report&quot;No. 25) the Japanese  Ambassador in  London has  enquired whether His  Majesty&apos;sGovernment are x^repared to supply the quantities of  shipbuilding material requiredor, failing this, to support the Japauese Governments applications at Washington tohave it exported from the United States.  In reply, His Excellency has been informedthat   the  exigencies  of  construction in  British  yards  and  the   shortage   ofsupplies, make it impossible  for His  Majesty&apos;s  Government to give any  assuranceas regards the export of shipbuilding materials as specified  by  the Japanese Govern-ment, and they are therefore unable to avail themselves of  the offer, contained  in  theJapanese Note, for the future  construction of tonnage for the Allies.  His Majesty&apos;sGovernment hope that the United States  may  be able to sanction the  export  ofmaterials to Japan,  but it is advisable that negotiations on this subject should becarried on between the Japanese and  the United States Governments.  His Majesty&apos;ambassador at Washington, duly informed of the position,  will be glad to render  allpossible  assistance  to  his Japanese colleague.   In  notifying Sir 0.  Greene of  theabove, His Majesty&apos;s- Government instructed him to let it be understood at TAokio thatHis Majesty&apos;s  Government are not in a position  to  give unconditional  support to japanese applications for the export of shipbuilding materials from the United States,inasmuch as they are equally  bound- to support  the United States application  forJapanese tonnage.                                     SLAM.   With  reference to the  Siamese Governments proposal to charter the ex-enemy ships at  Bangkok in certain proportions  to  Great Britain, France and  Japan (videlast  Report),  His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador  at  Tokio has reported that the JapaneseGovernment are quite willing to profit  by the proposed  arrangement, but  show noreadiness to allow any corresponding advantage  to the Allies in the way of  allotting.an equivalent amount of Japanese tonnage for the purpose of the wrar.  His Majesty&apos;representative at Bangkok reports, however, that the Siamese Government would be unwilling to charter any  ships to Japan unless due assurances were given that such vessels would be used for the relief of the war situation in  Europe,                                  ARGENTINA.    The German Minister at Buenos Aires has officially notified the Argentine Govern-ment that Germany will  indemnify them for &quot;the sinking of the S.S. &quot;Toro.&quot;   Hisnote declares that Germany, fighting for the freedom of  the seas, is restricted in herrecognition of  international  law by  the  illegal acts of  her enemies, but will  strivenevertheless to conform thereto.  The Argentine Minister at Berlin is convinced, asthe result of this graceful concession, that Argentine vessels will be immune  fromsubmarine warfare, and the officially  inspired Argentine  press regards the incident asa signal triumph  for Argentine diplomacy.  Speaking in Congress  on 31st August,the Acting Minister for Foreign  Affairs declared that &quot; so important a Power as&quot; Germany had bowed  before the  Argentine  Republic, recognising her claim to free&quot; navigation of the  seas, and had  made such reparation as to place our country in a&quot; highly  enviable position.&quot;   Sir  R. Tower  notes, however, that  amongst the  morethoughtful  section of  the  community the prevalent feeling  is one of mortification at.the position occupied by their country.    Questioned by His Majesty&apos;s Minister as to the treatment which would be accorded to one of  His Majesty&apos;s ships  if she were to pay a visit of  courtesy to Buenos Aires,the Argentine Government have replied  that the  visit of a  vessel of Great Britain, a&quot;friendly power,&quot; would  be received with the greatest pleasure,  and that she wouldbe  accorded the same treatment as  that which wras given to the United States  squadron in July.    The Commission on Wheat Supplies are in possession of absolute evidence that theGerman Naval Attache  at Buenos  Aires  has received large quantities  of  a certainfungus, together wdth  instructions to  have  it placed in wheat, so as to destroy the;.grain.  Sir R, Tower has been duly informed.
                                     PERU.   With reference to the proposed transfer of six German  steamers to  the Peruvianflag (under the conditions stated in Report No. 29)  His Majesty&apos;s Government have informed their representative at Lima,  that  until  they have ascertained the viewsof the United States Government  in the  matter, they cannot  give a definite reply.In the meanwhile, however, Mr. Renuie is authorised to inform the President that HisMajesty&apos;s Government  will  in   any case require satisfactory  assurances that the-proposed transfer is intended to he absolute; that the vessels will! not be  returnedto Germany till five  years  after the war ;  and that they (or  equivalent tonnage) will.be used during the war in  some particular  war service  in the interests of the Allies.                                   ECUADOR.    His Majesty&apos;s Minister  at  Quito is  confidentiahy informed that the foreign relations Committee are to meet on 8th December to decide the future foreign policyof Ecuador.   The Minister for Foreign Affairs intends  to advocate  that the  Republicshould throw in  its lot with the  Allies ; he has  suggested to  Mr.  Wilson that  itwould greatly strengthen his position in so doing  if  he could give the Committee a formal assurance by His Majesty&apos;s Legation that in  the event of her joining the Allies,.Ecuador might expect reasonable facilities  for; the importation  of cocoa into GreatBritain and of coal,  jute, &amp;c, into Ecuador.                                  VENEZUELA.    The  action  of President Gomez  in  suppressing the pro-Ally  newspaper, the&quot; Fonografo,&quot; seems to have filled to overflowing the cup of his tyrannical  misdeeds.Mr.  Beaumont  reports  (31st August)  that the United States Minister is submitting proposals to  his  Government for dealing with a  situation which has come to be-generally recognised as impossible.   The Diplomatic  Body at Caracas  are convincedthat nothing  but  the forcible removal of General Gomez  will meet the case.   TheItalian Government, who  have  serious  claims outstanding against Venezuela,  have instructed their Ambassador at Washington to discuss with the  State Department andwith  his Allied Colleagues, the means to.  be  adopted for their satisfaction.  In thisconnection  His Majesty&apos;s Government  have   intimated to  Sir C.  Spring Rice that,while willing to co-operate in preventing the ill-treatment of friendly journalists, theywould prefer  to leave to the United States  Government the responsibility for  adoptingany such rigorous policy as that which would involve  the removal of the President  ofa South American Republic.                                    MEXICO.    Mr. Cummins reports that Congress reopened on 1st September.  Sehor Carranza&apos;sspeech was  colourless; he  declared that Alexico&apos;s relations with all foreign,powers are extremely cordial.  He also announced his Governments intention  of institutingmilitary operations against the rebels in the region of the oil-fields, &quot; notwithstanding the assistance which the rebels receive from the petroleum companies.&quot;                                    PANAMA.    Sir C. Mallet telegraphed on 2nd September that four Australian troopships bound for Europe, having  been ordered by the Admiralty to  await the  arrival of the UnitedStates warship to act as escort, have thereby been detained  at Colon beyond the periodprescribed  in the  proclamation  of neutrality.   The Canal authorities, having  no-confirmation  of  the United States warship arrangement,  ordered  them to leave, andthe difficulty  was only obviated by the Governor&apos;s willingness to interpret&apos;the rule ina liberal spirit.  In this connection Sir C. Mallet observes  that  any British infringe-ment of the terms of  the Play-Pauncefote   treaty is likely hereafter to  serve the-purposes of those in the United States who desire to  abolish the  uniform Canal  tolls,.the retention  of which is a vital matter for British  trade.    The United States  Government require  that applications for  hospital  accommo-dation, on behalf-of Australian troopships passing through  the Canal, should be made-through His Majesty&apos;s Minister at Panama and the Embassy at Washington.
                               UNITED  STATES. m    Lord Northcliffe having found it difficult to devote sufficient time and attention tothe several urgent problems of finance  under discussion with Mr. McAdoo, expressedthe  opinion  that His  Majesty&apos;s Government  would  he well  advised to  appointLord Heading to go on  a special  mission  to  the  United States  for that purpose.Concurring in this opinion, His Majesty&apos;s Government have accordingly requestedLord Reading to undertake this mission, which  he  has  accepted.   He  will have full  powers  to negotiate  with  the  United States  Government and to decide any questions that may he raised.  His mission  will he  primarily financial,  but he is authorised to deal  with any other questions which, in his judgment, are involved  inthe proper discharge of his duties.   On 30th August Sir G. Spring Rice, informed ofthis decision, expressed the opinion that Mr. McAdoo  and his colleagues  would be highly gratified at the selection of Lord Reading, which he regarded as excellent.    On the 5th, he reported that one of the troopships was held up at Colon for repairs to machinery, but that  all difficulties had been overcome by the friendly attitude  ofthe Governor of the Canal.    On the recommendation of Lord Northcliffe,  the Ministry of Food have  appointedMr. Gledhill  to act provisionally as  buyer in the United States of  all civilian andmilitary requirements  of bacon, hams and  lard for the United Kingdom.   Mr.Gledhilbs functions in this  capacity commenced on 3rd September;  imports  of allbacon, hams  and lard into Great Britain, except under  licence, were prohibited by a proclamation issued on  the 31st August.    On  30th   August Lord Northcliffe  communicated, for  the information of theCabinet, his opinion that there has been a  very notable growth of enthusiasm for thewar throughout the United States.   The Opposition leaders continue to describe  thepublic  as  apathetic,  but even  in the Middle West the recruiting results have beenexcellent.  The President has  greatly strengthened his position by his reply to  the pope&apos;s Peace  Note and  by the embargo proclamation ; in neither case has he had todeal with any serious  force of  hostile  criticism.   Lord Northcliffe foresees that theAmerican people, slow  to enter the war, will be equally slow to stop it.   At the sametime,  they  do not yet understand why it  should  be necessary to fight  in Africa,Palestine and Mesopotamia,  and it will therefore  be  necessary  to organise   aneducational propaganda in order to convince public opinion  in the United States thatthe annexation of enemy territory in Africa and. elsewhere is necessary.    For  the  information  of the War Cabinet, Lord Ndrthcliffe  on the 30th August,communicated the opinion of  an English journalist,  as the  result of very carefulobservation,  that public opinion in America would fiercely resent any announcement,on the part  of Great  Britain,  of her  intention to retain  the German Colonies  inSouth Africa  (sic).   Very few  Americans believe that England entered  the war from disinterested motives of altruism, and any refusal to  discuss the retrocessionof  Germany&apos;s South African Colonies would be construed as proof that England was seeking selfish advantages, and  that American money and American lives are beingsacrificed in  order to enable her to do so.  In order to counteract this feeling (whichIrish-Americans  and German Agents are doing their best to develop), Lord  Northclifferecommends that His Majesty&apos;s Government should adopt the suggestion put forward by Colonel House, namely, that they should send General Smuts on  a special mission to the United States,  for the  purpose of explaining that  the  vast  majority  of thereal Colonials and of the  native population  of Germany&apos;s Colonies in  South Africa,desire to throw in their lot with the  great  self-governing British democracies.   Bythis means,  public opinion in  America might be  rapidly converted  to the idea of supporting the Colonials  and  natives  in their desire for self-government  and intheir opposition  to Prussian domination and tyranny.    Sir C. Spring Rice reports  that  the  British Military Mission  wdiich returned to washington from its  recruiting  tour in  the Western  States on 3rd September,  met with a most  cordial reception everywhere. There is evidence on all sides of a growingdetermination to see  the war  through and to recognise the extent of the services rendered by  Great Britain.  Irish agitators  and pro-Germans are walking delicatelyin consequence.   The latest effort of the German propagandists (including Mr. Hearst)has been  to  spread rumours  of new peace  offers by  Germany, including generalrestitution and  compensation, the money for  which  will be obtained  by  the  sale ofGermany&apos;s colonies to Great Britain.    Sir 0. Spring Rice reported on 30th August that the  State Department were about to renew their  pressing  demand (vide Reports  Nos. 25 and 27) for the release of       3S97-1                               E
American-owned goods  of German  origin lying at Rotterdam,  in all cases wherepayment has been made.   The State Department maintain that the only consideration at present pertinent to this question is whether  the release of these goods  can be shown to be of any benefit to Germany.  Congress is frequently impressing upon theState Department that when payment is proved to have been  properly completed,Germany has nothing to gain by the release  of the goods,  an opinion in which HisMajesty&apos;s  Ambassador  concurs.   He  considers  that this  long-standing  cause ofirritation (which the State Department  have described as a &quot;running sore &quot;) will notbe removed unless and until His Majesty&apos;s Government permit the release of all goodsnow lying in neutral  territory that  are neutral property in  the sense that they  were paid for before the United States entered into the  war.    In a  despatch of 3rd August, His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador  at Washington described the  great  difference  which has  been  effected  in the&quot; attitude  of  the  ShippingBoard  since  the  departure  of  Air,  Den mar,.   Mr.   RoycleiFs  relations with theBoard are at  present extremely cordial.  At the  same  time, Sir  C. Spring  Ricepoints  out that  it  will  be necessary for Great  Britain  and  the  United states to  come  to  an  amicable  arrangement  with regard to the disposal of  availableshipping,  for if  this  is  not  done  he apprehends  great difficulties in  the future.The manner of  Air.   DenmanS  dismissal  affords an  interesting  example  of  the presidents silent,.  autocratic  methods.   For  five  months,  as.  Chairman  of theShipping  Board, Mr. Denman  had  carried  matters  with a high  hand,  franklyexhibiting  his  German  sympathies and  behaving with  extreme  insolence to all those  with whom he came in contact.   He  and. his  friends  apparently  thoughtthat the  President, desiring to retain the support of California and the West generally,would be  unable to  dispense with  Mr.  Denman, who accordingly made use of hisposition  to appoint German Agents  to  positions of trust in the Shipping Board,   and gave out contracts  to  his  political  friends.   Up  to the  last moment, the Presidentgave no  sign,  and Mr. Denman remained confident of his security of tenure, openlyboasting that Goethals would have to go, and  that he himself would, remain  in office.He was,  then, summarily dismissed without warning  or opportunity for  discussion,and it is  not known that President Wilson  discussed his action in advance  withanybody.  The nett result is that the Board is now working  admirably.    Referring to the Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer on the subjectof  exchange  (vide Report No.  28), the  Assistant Secretary of  the Treasury hasunofficially pointed out certain features  of  the  situation to Lord Northcliffe   andMr. Bayley and requested an expression of opinion thereon.  He suggests  that if theUnited States continue to  incur heavy liabilities  in addition to  affording extensivecredits to  the Allies, and  if imports from India and Australia continue to be large,.a considerable British gold trade will result.  He  considers  that if  the United states treasury agree to grant  credits for  British purchases of  cotton, and Canadian wheat,Great Britain should  reciprocate in giving (for  example) credits for United Stateswool purchases in Australia and jute purchases in India.    The Japanese Special Mission to the United States will not confine its negotiations(as originally reported by Sir C. Spring Rice)  to questions arising directly out of thewar.  The Special Envoy has now informed His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador that amongst other subjects be will discuss with the  United  States  Government the status of&quot;Japanese residents in California and the policy of  the Allies in China.    Early in August Sir C. Spring Rice was instructed by the  Foreign Office to suggest to the United States  Government that they  should, send instructions to their repre-tentative at Monrovia to join with his British  and  French colleagues in requesting theLiberian Government to deport a certain  Austrian doctor to France.  Sir C. Spring-Rice reports (2nd September) that the United States Government are unable  to take any action in the matter, because the Liberian  Government  have  not asked them to do so and also because there has been no declaration of  a state  of  war between Austria andthe United States.    Referring to recent requests by the United States Government for the provision ofadditional tonnage to  carry Spanish  pyrites to  America,  the Foreign Office  have instructed  Sir Spring Rice to suggest that if some form of Government control  wereinstituted and enforced upon companies producing sulphur, the  United States could in a short time render themselves  independent of Spanish  pyrites for Avar purposes and thus effect a very considerable  economy  in the use  of  tonnage.  His Majesty&apos;sGovernment havre reason to believe that the sulphur deposits in the United States are:capable of  considerable deATelopmentv
                         THE SHIPPING  SITUATION.    On .30th August His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Washington reported that, after-consultation with the Exports  Board, he had arranged to refer to them henceforwardall application for letters of assurance.   The  United States Government, he says, havenot yet finally decided as  to the  machinery to be  set up for bringing  their  exportpolicy into conformity with Great Bri.tain&apos;s blockade policy, but for the-present nolicences will be issued for Scandinavia or Holland.  Sir G. Spring Rice has handed to the Chairman of the Board a memorandum which will indirectly raise the questionof creating a Blockade Council in London, as  desired by His Majesty&apos;s Government.The Chairman has  inquired as  to  the conditions upon  which.  Great  Britain, coulddispense with the examination of vessels at Halifax ; he points out that, by clearing.as many ships as possible (subject to naval and military considerations) from United.States ports direct,  a considerable saving in tonnage would be effected, and it might lead to increased efficiency of inspection.   The Board has discussed- the matter indetail with Mr. MacCormick.  The naval authorities at  Halifax are understood to bein favour of  the change, and Sir C.  Spring Rice therefore suggests  that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment should seriously consider  the advisability of transferring examination ofvessels to United States ports.    The Chairman  of the United States Shipping Board  informed Mr.  Royden on31st August that, subject to the military requirements of the United States Army inFrance, British ships building in American yards would be handed  over as  and when-completed;   the  United  States  Government  will not, however,  give  any  officialassurances on the subject.    According to  information  supplied by  a  Stockholm  shipowner,  the  swedish government are telling  shipowners that Germany will regard it as  a provocativebreach of neutrality if any Swedish vessels are chartered to the Allies.  Sir E. Howardthinks that  the German Government  may  possibly have  threatened reprisals,  but nothing more.   German agents are busy at Stockholm endeavouring to arrange  longterm freight contracts for coal, &amp;c.  One leading shipowner has received an offer to-time  charter  any of his  vessels  for 10 years  after the war to  carry ferro-manganesefrom the Black Sea and return cargoes of coal.    Sir C. Spring Pice reported on  2nd September that  the Swiss Government haveeight Spanish ships, sent to load grain, at United States  ports.  The  Exports board have licensed three cargoes of malt and barley but decline to license wheat shipmentsand have advised the Swiss Minister that  the remaining five ships should seek wheat-cargoes  in  Australia.    The Swiss Minister  has inquired whether His  Majesty&apos;sG-overnment would, consent to their  doing so.                            PEACE  DISCUSSIONS.    On 3rd September the Organization Committee at Stockholm  announced  that, inconsequence of the results of the Allied Conference in London, they had decided notto summon the Stockholm Conference  on 9th September, but to defer it to a date to-be  determined so soon as the  Russian delegation arrives  in  Sweden.   Two dayspreviously, the Russian Prime  Minister had requested Sir G. Buchanan  to urge HisMajesty&apos;s Government to grant passports to the British Socialist delegates to attend the conference at Stockholm.   The Prime Alinister fully recognised the fact that  theBritish SeameiPs Union might refuse to allow the delegates to proceed to Sweden, buthe regarded this as unimportant, so long as His majesty&apos;s Government did not refuseto issue passports.    On the  30th August the Foreign Office communicated  to His Majesty&apos;s Represen-tatives at Paris, Rome, Petrograd, Havre, and Tokio, the decision  of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment, that, in  view of President Wilsoids reply to the Papal Peace Note, it wasnot necessary for the Allied  Powers  to address  any further communication to  the&quot;Vaticau.   In  connection  with  this communication,  Lord Bertie  reported  on  thefollowing day that M. Ribot&apos;was of opinion  that a  communique should be addressedto the Press  by the British and French Governments jointly, and he was thereforeforwarding a  draft  communique  for  the  consideration  of  His Majesty&apos;s  Govern-ment.  In  reply, Lord Bertie was instructed  to state that His Majesty&apos;s Government&quot;were  not  in  favour  of  publishing  any communique  on the  subject  or  at most     3897-1                               F
a  bare  statement  to   the   effect   that,  in  view  of  President  Wilsoifs  Note,.the Allies  do not  consider  it  necessary  to make  any further reply to the  Papalmessage.    In any case His  Majesty&apos;s  Government  considered  it  inadvisable to publish a statement until all the Allied Governments  had expressed their  views onthe subject, lest  anything should lead the enemy to think that the Allies are not ofone mind.   Furthermore, His Majesty&apos;s  Government consider it of  great  importance that all  the  Allies  should  unite in endorsing President Wilsoits attitude, not only because  this  would please the American people,  but also because  it would avoidraising amongst the Allies such differences of opinion as have already been manifestedin certain  directions, differences which  might necessitate  a  general  discussion  and definite  statement  of all the Allies&apos; war aims.  In  connection  with  the  Presidents.reply to the Holy See, it is of  interest to note that a confidential communication onthe subject, addressed to Mr. Balfour from Washington on 1st September, observesthat the Presidents message should  provide the Allies with the means of showing a.united front.  The writer added that it is unnecessary to attach too much importanceto  the Presidents  expressions  relating to peace  terms, for these are subject to modification from  day  to  day, and will eventually  be determined  by the  march ofevents.    The Belgian Government have received assurances from the Belgian Minister tothe Vatican that  the German Government knows and accepts the Pope&apos;s interpretation.of his reference to Belgium as meaning &quot; complete restoration and indemnities/&apos;    Further, Baron de Broqueville has declared that Belgium will not  consider peace conditions  until the demands of France and Italy are fully satisfied.    Idle &quot; New Rotterdam Courant &quot; has recently discussed the question as to whethernegotiations have actually taken place for a separate  r^eace  between Rumania  andthe Central Powers.  The  German  Press  indignantly denies the rumour as well as.the statements made by M. Kerensky at  Moscow.  Sir W. Townley reported  on  the31st August, that reliable information which he has  received goes to show that peace proposals were actually made, on the initiative of the King of Rumania and  Bratiano,.and that the negotiations were finally broken off  at  Rumanian Headquarters, chieflybecause of  the exhorbitaut nature of Bulgaria&apos;s  demands  upon Rumania.  Writingon this subject, the &quot; Vorwarts &quot; of 28th August, declares with reference to Kerensky&apos;reference to the attempt at a  separate peace, that the German people can only breathefreely if the Government now declares&apos;that the whole thing is untrue.   It is  necessarythat they should give an immediate explicit and definite reply on the subject, for the&quot;&quot;general peace &quot; whose principles are laid down  in  the Reichstag resolution will  notbe advanced, but only damaged by this secret peace hawking, which goes  from back-door to backdoor to ask if there is nothing doing.    The  &quot; Vor warts&quot; of 29th  August  states that on.  the  previous  day  the main committee of the Reichstag discussed the question of occupied territories.  Belgiumwas not mentioned, but  after a lively discussion the following motion was adopted withregard to Lithuania :     &quot; The Committee resolves that the Reichstag should request the Chancellor  to  set.       up  for  the  peoples  of the  occupied territories of Lithuania and  Courland       representation which would have the confidence of  all  classes  of  people,  and       to create civil government, so far as military considerations will permit.&quot;                                   GENERAL.    The Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs has assured Sir G. Buchanan that  there-is absolutely no truth in the report that the Russian  and Austrian Governments havebeen in telegraphic communication respecting  the exchange of  invalided prisoners  ofwar ;  all negotiations have been conducted  through Stockholm.  Nor has there been.any question of the exchange of able-bodied prisoners  with Austria, or  of  a  neutralexchange  zone,  which would  afford  the  enemy  an  opportunity  of  obtainingmilitary information.    His Majesty&apos;s Government have requested the Dutch authorities to ascertain whether,.pending the provision of suitable accommodation in Holland, the German Government-will agree to an arrangement for the repatriation via Holland of the various  categories-of exchanged prisoners, in the following order : (1)  invalided combatants ; (2) invalided.
civilians ; (3) civilians  over 45.  When  accommodation has  been provided,  they propose that the order of repatriation shall be as follows :     Incapacitated combatants for repatriation.    Invalid combatants for internment.    Officers aud non-commissioned officers over 18  months in captivity, for internment.    Invalid civilians for repatriation.    Invalid civilians for internment.    Civilians over 45.    The German Government have agreed to  the use of Boston as the harbour for the landing  and embarkation  of exchanged  prisoners, but insist that as the use of thisport cannot be unlimited, the largest possible number of ships, both screw and paddle,must be used.  Further, the only  guaranteed mine-free route will  be  that  betweenFlushing and South wold.  The Zeeland  Company, however, state that  their vessels are too large to use the inner harbour ; they presume that  it  will  therefore benecessary for them  to lie in the roadstead for embarkation, and they enquire whetherthe anchorage is  a safe and suitable one.   They suggest  that Lowestoft might be generally more convenient.  His Majesty&apos;s Government have directed Sir W.  Townleyto  state, in  reply,  that Boston is in every respect  a more suitable  harbour thanLowestoft.    Sir W. Townley strongly recommends that, with a view to efficient co-ordination and co-operation and to facilitate relations with the Dutch G overnment, General HanburyWilliams should be appointed the nominal head of  all  departments (including theY.M.C.A.. and the Red Cross) dealing with prisoners of war from Germany in  Holland.He proposes to locate the three services in one suitable building, which would become the recognised centre for British prisoners in ITolland.  The representatives  of theY.M.C. A. and of the Red Cross at The Hague coucur in this proposal.  Sir W. Townleyalso reports, in this connection, that the question has arisen  as  to whether the DutchRed Cross should take any initiative in these matters ; he is  strongly of opinion thatif the British Authorities and Red Cross  do not  assume Rail control from  the start,there is sure to be friction.    A scheme has been laid before the Foreign Office  by Mr. Harte, of  the Y.M.C.A.(lately from  Copenhagen), to charter a ship and purchase food in the  United States for allied  and  Enemy prisoners.   In  informing Sir C. Spring Rice  of this  proposalHis Majesty&apos;s  Government  mention, amongst  other  conditions  which  it  would impose, that the supplies should be carried in a German ship manned by neutrals.    The  Swiss  Minister  for Foreign Affairs has expressed doubts  as to the possibilityof  complying with  the request of the Serbian  Government for the internment  inSwitzerland of Serbian  prisoners now in Austria-Hungary.   He states that there is a growing feeling in  the country against taking  in any more.  He  has  promised  toconsider the matter before communicating a  definite decision to Sir H. Rumbold.    The Turkish Government continue  to meet all enquiries and proposals  on thesubject of prisoners of war  by  reiterating their demand  for the  release  of AyoubSabri (vide Report No. 30).   They have  now declined to  allow prisoners&apos; internmentcamps to be visited until this demand is conceded.  On 1st September Sir W. Townleywas instructed  to  request the Dutch Government to point out that His  Majesty&apos;sGovernment have  already  offered to send  delegates  to  meet Turkish  delegates inSwitzerland to discuss the exchange of Ayoub Sabri and other questions.    In accordance with, a proposal put forward by the German Minister at Berne, HisAIajesty&apos;s Government have agreed that  the repatriation, of invalid prisoners underclauses 2 and 5 of the Hague Agreement shall be left entirely in the  hands of the swiss Commissions.   On 31st August Colonel Picot reported that 8G British  officersand  774 of other  ranks had  thus  been  selected  for repatriation; the number  of germans selected was under 400.
