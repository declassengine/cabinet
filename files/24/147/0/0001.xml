SECRET.APPRECIATION  OF  THE  ATTACHED  WESTERN  AND  GENERAL                           REPORT&apos;  No.                                     CANADA.   The decision of Sir Robert Borden. to withdraw the Resolution for the extension ofthe life of Parliament has rendered an early appeal to the people a practical  certainty.If something  like unanimity had. been  secured  for  the Resolution, or at any rate amajority which included  all  the pro-Conscriptionist Liberals,  the Prime  minister would  probably  have sent, the  Resolution  to  the  Senate and avoided  a GeneralElection.   As it  is,  all indications  point,  to preparations  for a strenuous light onthe Conscription issue, and  some of the Liberal elements  who favour Conscriptionseem  to  be rallying again to the flag of Sir Wilfrid Laurier  and may thus succeed in preventing  the  formation of a  Coalition Government.  Meantime, the House ofCommons has  passed  the Third  Reading of the  Military Service Bill, and Parliament,will doubtless proceed to place the measure on the Statute Book before the dissolutiontakes place.   Its provisions, however, will no doubt remain in abeyance till after theGeneral Election.                                  SOUTH AFRICA.   The statement issued by the Federal Council  of  the Nationalist  Party shows thatthe steps  taken  in   condemnation  of the  Republican campaign  have  apparentlyconvinced  the Nationalists that  active  propaganda  in favour of Republicanism willnot serve their own interests  at the present time.                                      ITALY.    The coal question is really serious  and vitally affects  Italy&apos;s attitude towards thecontinuance of the war through another winter.                                     GllKECE.    M. Venizelos is determined  to  reduce the  power of the  Crown to  the  barestminimum, and he clearly finds no possibility of  compromise with. non-Liberal Greeks.The withdrawal of  the Allied troops and the restoration of Greek ships proves thatM. Venizelos  is really master of  the situation.   One can but  hope that, the Italianswill find  it possible to  appear  a little more reasonable in their attitude and their actions.    Now that we  can review the  recent developments in Greece, a word of thanks isdue from the Allies  to M.  Jonnart, who carried through the  Allied policy with suchconspicuous courage, skill, and success.                i
                                GERMAN AFFAIRS.   The main events of the week have been the  new Chancellor&apos;s speech, the carryingof the war aims resolution in the  Reichstag on a division, and the  resumption of aGerman offensive against Russia.   Dr. Michaelis voiced the sentiments of the PrussianGeneral Staff,   lie  stands for  the full  rigour of an aggressive  military autocracy,while the Reichstag continues to be an ineffective debating society.   it will be interesting to watch  the effect of  the Berlin  utterances upon Austrianand  even Bavarian opinion, for there can be little doubt that the steady pressure ofthe Proletariat in both these countries will be reinforced.  This  pressure  is exertedin-&apos;two;directions. peace and democratization.   In  regard  to the  former, there is  an obvious tendency of the Catholic parties to prevent, the  Socialists  from reaping the fruits of all the latent popular support in favour of  peace, while no parties are morefirm in  their opposition to democratization.                                  UNITED STATES.   The financial arrangements  are still unconcluded.   The proposal to form an Inter-Allied Council in. London should mean an important step  forward  in co-ordinating theAllied demands for  American supplies.  It is  to be hoped, however, that the UnitedStates will  realise  the difficulties of such  a Council attempting  to tsecure  the  jointagreement of the Allies in dealing  with their respective financial  requirements, whileit is obvious that the allocation  of British shipping to the needs  of the Allies cannotbe controlled by this Council.   The arrangements, however, that are in contemplationare of first-rate importance in relation to effective co-operation in the future.

PART  I.-BRITISH  EMPIRE  AND  AFRICA.                                  GENERAL.    The Shipping Controller has suggested to  the  Dominion Governments that theycould economise shipping by restricting imports of non-essentials.  It is not thoughtthat this  cani be clone  by restricting imports from the  United  Kingdom  and  themaintenance of these is  desirable, and indeed vital with regard to Canada, from theExchange  standpoint.   Again, efforts should be made to prevent the stoppage  oftrade with the Allies, more  particularly Italy, France,  and  Portugal;  while exports from Norway, Sweden, Denmark, and Holland of those goods which might be useful to Germany should not be impeded in the interests of the blockade. To all Dominionsexcept Canada, it is suggested that, on account of the shipping and  Exchange situation,it would be well to  discourage imports from the United States.    Regarding the  transport of Australasian troops via Panama and  the reply of theNew Zealand Government as to the  cost  of transport  across America,1  it has  been pointed out  to that Dominion that  the transport  arrangements still hold good  inrelation to  co-operation with  the Government of the Commonwealth,  but on theoccasion referred to the  Cape route will be adopted by the  Australian transport &quot; PortMelbourne.&quot;  In reply the New Zealand Government express dissatisfaction that the route should be altered  after  they had given careful  consideration  to the  previousarrangements.  They call attention to the necessity that, if  troops are transferred  atCape Town, provision shall  be made for  shipping certain produce now on their ship which sailed for Panama on  14th July, and which was  diverted to the Cape route onthe 15th.   As to the future, the Dominion Government  desire  that the decision toadopt the  Panama route should be maintained.    In pointing out  the desirability of  maintaining secrecy  regarding the new Govern-ment cable,1 the Secretary of State informs the Dominion Governments that enquirerswdio wish to know why the telegrams come through the Post  Office will be told merelythat they come over the  new cable, without further  particulars.                                   CANADA.    Owing to the  opposition of the Liberals to the Resolution  extending the life ofParliament, Sir Robert Borcien announced in  the Dominion House  of  Commons  on18th July that the Government had decided not to press the measure.  It  is anticipated in Ottawa that Parliament may continue for  another month or  so  to  conclude  thebusiness of the Session, and that  a dissolution will take place in September and aGeneral Election  in the following month or in November.    A conference  of about 50 Liberal Members of Parliament and candidates of  theProvince of Ontario has  been held at, Toronto, when  the decision was  made to fightthe General Election under the leadership of Sir Wilfrid Laurier.  It was announcedthat the conference was against the extension of the term of Parliament  and opposedto a Coalition Government.  It expressed itself  in favour of  a  united effort beingmade under the  voluntary system before the  application  of compulsion, and at thesame time advised that a complete inventory of the mobilised resources of the nationfor war purposes  should be taken.    A  campaign is being commenced  in  Ontario  by the &quot;  Win-the-War League&quot; inorder to ensure the return of a Government pledged to carry on the war with vigour.Sir Clifford Sifton, who is taking a prominent  part in the  movement, points out thatit  is of a  non-Party character.  A convention will be called at  Toronto on 2nd  or3rd August, and the attendance of all who are in favour of a  Coalition Governmentand conscription is requested.   The Military Service  Bill passed  the  Third Reading in the  Dominion House ofCommons on 24th July by 102 votes to 44.See Western and General Report for week ending 18th July 1917.
   The Food Controller of Canada (Mr. Hanna) is organising his Department so thatthe best experience in the Dominion may be available towards securing the necessaryfood supplies for the United Kingdom and the Allies.  The  organisation that he issetting up consists of six departments and a central Advisory Committee.  The latter will  advise the departments  through the Controller, and  the first  committee hasalready reported in  favour of  the restriction of consumption of various commodities.In this connection, His Majesty the King has sent a message to the Governor-Generalof Canada, in which he expresses his  &quot;deep gratification at the effective steps taken&quot; in the Dominion of Canada towards providing  those increased supplies of  food&quot; which are absolutely essential to the defeat of the  enemy&apos;s devices and a  speedy and&quot; successful termination of the war.&quot;   Lord  Rhondda has sent a message to theCanadian Food Controller  in which  he  states that the  British  Authorities  arelooking to the resources of  Canada for  an answer to Germany&apos;s threat of starvation.lie points  out  that  war has accentuated  the  dependence of  the  United Kingdomupon Canada for supplies  of food, and  these supplies are now vital  for the UnitedKingdom and  her  European  Allies.  He points out that this  must entail  ceaselesseffort and  sacrifice  on  the  part  of Canadians.  While recognising the difficulty inthe supply of labour on account of so many having gone to the Front, Lord Rhonddaexpresses his conviction that  the  people of Canada will surmount all obstacles andthat the harvest  will afford  a striking demonstration  of  Canadian  efficiency and determination.   He  adds  that the certainty of being able  to rely upon Canadianco-operation both to increase production and  to adjust prices equitably  affords him the greatest encouragement.                              NEWFOUNDLAND.   The Government have  asked if the  British Treasury can  advance  the  sum  of258,000Z. for war expenditure.   With reference to  the proposed  change of  Ministry, the Prime Minister has completed  the  arrangements contemplated.1  Amongst  the  measures to be brought forward by the  new Government will be the grant of supplies, already passed  in committee,  the introduction of a Bill extending  the term of  the  present  Houseof Assembly  to  some  time in  1918  and  the  introduction  of  a Bill for the taxation of war profits.  It is intended thoroughly to canvas all constituencies in orderto obtain sufficient recruits to keep up the strength of the Newfoundland naval andmilitary forces.  It is hoped that  this  can be  done without  the  introduction  of compulsory  service, but  if  the recruiting  effort is  not  successful, measures  of compulsion will be considered.   With regard to the  transport of soldiers and foresters,1 the Admiralty state thereis no cruiser available, but  that  the men should embark  at Halifax  on a  trooptransport or at Montreal on one of the liners which carry troops.                      AUSTRALIAN  COMMONWEALTH.   Mr.  Hughes   has  given expression to  his views  upon  the recent speech  of dr. Michaelis, in the course of which he said :  &quot; I agree that the crisis was developed&quot; by the manipulation  of  cunning hands to  a point which  enabled  the Prussian&quot; Junkers in Germany&apos;s military party to secure the substance, leaving the  shadow&quot; of the proletariat.  I believe that Dr. Michaelis is placed in the proud position that&quot; he has to be at one and the same time the expression and pliant tool of the military&quot; party.  I agree entirely with Mr. Lloyd  George that his honeyed mouthings about&quot; peace are  hypocritical cant  intended  both to  soothe the unfortunate masses  of&quot; Germany  and to deceive  the world.  There is  and  can  be only one end  to this&quot; dreadful  business -the complete destruction of  Germany&apos;s military  power.  .  . .&quot; Mr. Lloyd George may rest assured that  he has behind him a united Empire.&quot;    The Bill to amend the Unlawful Associations Act of 1915 has been passed by theCommonwealth House  of Representatives.  This is designed to strengthen the hands1 See Western and General Report for -week ending 18th July 1917.
of the Government in regard to&apos;.such Associations as the Independent Workers of theWorld (vide  Appendix to Report  No. .25), and under the provisions  it will be an offence to be  a.member of, or to subscribe to, an Association which  has been notifiedin the  Government  Gazette,  while the property  and correspondence of  such anAfssociation will be liable  to seizure.   In this connection  it may be noted  that  thepolice have just executed  a raid upon the I. WAV.  premises in Sydney.  A quantityof publications was seized but no arrests, were made.   In moving the Second  Reading  of the Wheat  Storage Bill,  Mr.  Hughes  stated inthe House of Representatives that, as a result of the shortage of  shipping, wheat wasbeing stored  in Australia.   The possible destruction of this could not be  contemplated,and  in  erecting  silos the Government  was following the example of every wheat-producing country.   The Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Tudor) supported the bill and expressed the hope that the States would agree to it.   Mr. Hughes, in introducing the Bill to amend the Public Service Act, to  facilitate the employment of returned  soldiers, explained that the Bill threw open the door ofthe service to every returned soldier up to the age of 50, who had a satisfactory record,and who chose to present  himself for the prescribed examination and  passed.   Anotherclause related to the maintenance of  those soldiers  in the service who had receivedonly temporary employment.   The Australian  Government  have placed British soldiers on the  same basis asreturned Axistralian soldiers in regard to settlement on  the land.  This means thatthe Commonwealth will be prepared to give the  British soldier settler an averageamount of 500L to enable  him to  buy plant  and stock, and build  a house, &amp;c, leaving the British Government to make arrangements for acquiring the land settled upomThe Commonwealth ask the British Government  to give  an indication  of their policyin the matter as  the Australian authorities are anxious to do anything necessary to induce British soldiers to  settle in Australia.   The  Commonwealth  Government have again  approached the  Treasury with  asuggestion that  authorisation should now be given for raising in London a loan of6,84Q,O00L, as the States are pressing for money.1   It  is pointed out that 3,00O,0O0Lof the proposed loan could be utilised for re-funding the amount which was previouslytaken from   War Loan funds  for the purposes of the States&apos;  requirements.   Therest of  the   amount is wanted to meet the loan  expenditure  of  the  States up to31st December 1917.                               &quot;                           -    With regard to  the supply of tinplates,2 Mr. Hughes  has  telegraphed  that  it is imperative to arrange for the supply from  the  United  Kingdom without further delay.  Failing  this, the  Commonwealth will be  forced  to arrange for the  supply from the United States.    At a special meeting  of Liberal members of the South Australian Parliament a motion  was carried favouring the formation of a Coalition Government.    The  Commonwealth  Government, have obtained by means of  an interceptedtelegram  information regarding the proposed  purchase  by  the  representative of japanese interests of a nickel mine in New Caledonia.  The telegram points out thatthere are only two uncontrolled mines from which  sufficient supplies of  nickel can beobtained quickly, and that to control both would ensure the required supplies for lOyears.The Commonwealth Government consider the matter  of  such vital importance, both from an Imperial and national point of view, that they ask the British Government tocommunicate with France with a view to preventing the transfer.    The Commonwealth Government  have- been informed that it is possible for theBritish authorities to use  some Norwegian  sailing vessels.  On account of the  risks entailed in European waters, the British Government wish to use these ships in those parts of the world where there is  not such great danger from  submarines.   TheShipping Controller has suggested  that  they might  be  sent to Australia to beemplo3Ted in the transport of wheat to either the Atlantic or Pacific Coasts of Americaand a similar amount of wheat could in  that  case  be released from the United states for use  in Europe.  It  is  thought that  two voyages per annum undertaken by theships which  are available  would probably transport  900,000 tons of wheat.   TheAustralian Ministers were asked  if  they would  be  prepared to  assist in carrying out this scheme  and they have replied that  if it is proceeded with they will be glad toco-operate.   1 See Western  and General Report for weeks ending&apos; 2Sth March, 18th and 25th April, and 2nd and 9th May 1917.   2 See Western and General Report for weeks ending 27th June and 18th July  1917.     3441-4                              B
   The Commonwealth Government have  been  asked if  they would  be willing toremove the import duty on flour and wheat in favour of the United States, as, in &quot;that event, the Government of that country would be able to extend reciprocal treatmentby abolishing the  duty on  Australian flour and  wheat which is  imported  into theUnited States.   The Wheat  Commission consider that the proposal, if carried intoeffect, would assist  the transportation of Australian flour  and wheat in the UnitedStates, and might also permit of American  wheat being  exported from the Atlanticside in  exchange for wheat from the  Commonwealth  imported on  the Pacificside.                                NEW ZEALAND.   The Admiralty have offered H.M.S. &quot; Torch,&quot; now in Wellington Harbour, as a gift.to the Dominion Government for use in whatever Avay they think desirable.                                SOUTH AFRICA.   The Federal Council of the Nationalist Party have issued a statement in justification-of the attitude  adopted towards  Republicanism (vide  Appendix to Report No. 22).In this it is asserted that the Republican sentiment is legitimate, but that any attemptto alter the status of the Union must  proceed on Constitutional lines, as this statusrests upon the people&apos;s will.   The Council disapprove of representing the matter  of independence as a race  question which may lead to civil war, but  they consider thatit is at present undesirable  to carry on active Republican propaganda which might cause offence and  bitterness.  They argue, however, that a position must be won for south  Africa, as well as  for other self-governing  British Colonies, more consistent with her  dignity as a  self-governing  State standing on a par  with England.   TheCouncil appuove the principle that all  nations, small or great,  should  have completefinal disposal of their own destiny and they  hope this will be laid down at the PeaceConference and  that South Africa maybe included in its practical application.   A Constitutional League to oppose the Republican propaganda of the Nationalistsha&apos;s  been  formed  at Johannesburg  with  the  idea of  extending the  organisationthroughout the Union.   A representative meeting in the typical  Dutch  district  of Bredasdorp was heldduring the week, when  a  Resolution was unanimously passed  against the Republicanpropaganda.   Gratitude was also expressed for  the  protection afforded by the british flag under which &quot; We  are a Republic as far  as freedom, is concerned, in everythingbut in name.&quot;   Speaking in this town, Mr. Burton, Minister of Railways and Finance,said that  the views contained in the Nationalist Manifesto  were  repudiated  by theEnglish-speaking section  and by the great majority of the Dutch.   He  observed thatthere  was nothing in the  history of  South Africa  to justify the  growth of  the republican spirit.    With   regard  to the   suggestion  that  the Union   Government  should receiveGermans from East Africa for internment in camps within the  Union, the South African Government telegraph that  there is urgent necessity  for  increased hospital and convalescent accommodation for men  returning from East Africa who are suffering from malaria.   It is believed that it will be essential to use all  available accommoda- tion for this purpose, and the  Government hope that the women  and1&apos; children from German. East Africa  will not  at present be  sent to  the  Union.   If it is quite impossible for the  British Government  to send the  women  and children elsewhere, the Union Ministers will  consider whether it will be  possible to  make some special arrangements for meeting the situation, but any accommodation afforded would  have to be at British expense.   With regard  to the 173 male German civilians, these can be interned  at Fort Napier, Pietermaritzberg.    As the monthly output of Katanga  copper may have to be  reduced, through the Rhodesian Railway being unable to  supply sufficient coal for  the mines, due to the shortage  of  engine power,  the Union Ministers have  been  asked whether they can release some of their locomotive engines on the  Bulawayo-Vryberg section of the railway.   It is pointed out  that any  reduction of  the  Katanga  copper output is a serious matter for  the British Ministry of Munitions.
                        PORTUGUESE EAST AFRICA.    The Portuguese Minister for Foreign Affairs states  that he cannot allow as many as  100,000  carriers,  which he understands  have been  asked for by the BritishOommander-in-Chief, to be recruited from  Portuguese East Africa.   He states that17,000 are required for the Portuguese forces, and. as regards the number which canbe  recruited for the British  authorities, it  is considered that the matter should  bearranged locally with the Governor-General.   Meantime, however, the  British Consul-at Lorenzo Marques has reported that General Van  Dcventer requires  12,000 carriersby  the end of August and 6,000 per month afterwards.   Facilities have been- given forrecruiting in Mozambique and Quieviotete, where it is anticipated the numbers maybe  obtained if a free hand is given.PART IL-FOREIGN AFFAIRS.                         ALLIED COMMON AFFAIRS.   With regard to the representation of the Serbian and Rumanian Governments atthe Paris Conference on  25th J uly, the Secretary of Stare  for Foreign Affairs  tele-graphed to the French, Russian  and Italian Ambassadors that he  had been asked ifSerbia and Rumania might send representatives.   The  Secretary of State  suggestedthat the best course was to confine the actual representation  to the  Great Powers, butto suggest  to Serbia, Rumania and Greece  that officers representing them in Parismight be called upon for their views during the Conference. This attitude was endorsed by the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Russia and Italy.  Meantime it was reported thatthe Serbian Government had. received a verbal invitation from the French Governmentand that the Prime Minister started for Paris on 21st July.   The intention of the FrenchGovernment was that Rumanian, Serbian and Greek representatives should be present at the commencement of the Conference and. be asked for their views, but  it appearsthat the Serbian Prime Minister considered  the invitation, which was given verballyto the Serbian  Minister at Paris, as applicable to himself.  The actual words  in the communique published at Paris on 21st July  concerning the smaller Powers  in relationto  the  Conference  were:  &quot; avec voix consultative  la Serbie, la  Roumanie  et laGrece.&quot;  It is to be  noted that earlier in the month Baron Sonnino had expressed thedesire that the Conference should be  confined to the four Great Powers  principally concerned.    With reference to the statement made in  the House of Commons that the initiative in proposing an Allied Conference for the revision of agreements had been taken  bythe Russian Government, Sir George Buchanan has telegraphed that the Minister forForeign Affairs is very glad to undertake the  responsibility of suggesting that this conference should take place  in  London during  the first  part of September.  Theidea would  be  that  some decision, should be arrived at with regard to the  generalobjects for which the Allies are fighting rather  than to agree upon the exact details ofthe terms of peace.   Sir George Buchanan suggests  that the  desires of the RussianGovernment should be met in the matter of  the Conference, and that a full  discussionwith  such men as  the Ministers  for Foreign Affairs and War would  bring about a notable  advance in  the  views held by the Socialist Ministers towards the war.  Onthe other  hand, the French Ambassador at Petrograd has reported to Paris  that  hehas had a conversation with Sir George Buchanan  on  the subject  of the Conference,but that he does not think the Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs is  desirous thatthe Conference should take place, as he has not  mentioned it to  him.  Lord Bertiesubmits that  a Conference  of  the  nature  indicated  would . probably  emphasise-differences among the Allied Nations, and that  it would  be  better for each of  themto agree individually upon the maximum and minimum advantages which it is hoped to obtain,  in accordance with the manner  in which the war may terminate, and forthe present to concentrate upon securing a victory over Germany.   It should be addedthat the views of Baron Sonnino on the subject of this Conference were also conveyed to His Majesty&apos;s Government earlier in the  month to the effect  that there would  be.some difficulty in selecting the Powers to take part in the Conference as, if it was to
review treaties, the representatives of France, Russia, Great Britain and Italy wouldbe alone concerned.   It has been pointed out to the Italian Government  that His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwas only willing to  consider the  admission of increased silk  imports (70 per cent.instead of 50 per cent.) on the basis that no exports reached the enemy.  As it appearsthat the Government of Italy will only give up these exports if the Allies meet thefinancial loss, the proposal for increased  imports into  the  United  Kingdom cannotbe entertained.   The Italian Government have been asked to ratify the silk agreementimmediately,  as a  considerable  amount  of silk is  reaching  the enemy  throughSwitzerland.  It is understood that the French Government are  disposed  to agreeWMilan as the place of the head purchasing  Bureau.  (See Report No.  23.)                                   FRANCE.   At the secret session of the Senate held on 19th July, Lord Bertie understandsthat  Messieurs Debierre and  Berenger criticise I  at  length the military authorities,.especially in relation to the preparations for  the April offensive.  The tendency ofM. BerengeFs remarks was  to  criticise  the Minister for War rather than General Nivelle.  In reply, the Minister for War delivered  a four hours&apos; speech in winch it isbelieved he  stated that on coming into office he was not. in  accord with the strategy ofGeneral Nivelle, but lie had not been free to deal with the  matter.   He defended  thePresident of the Republic with regard  to  the allegations  that he had attempted to use-influence in military affairs.                                   BELGIUM.   The &quot; Berliner Tageblatt &quot; of 19th July announces  that Belgium is now  divided .into  two sections for purposes  of administration, and that the administrative head-quarters for Flanders are situated at Brussels and those for Wallonia at Namur.                                    ITALY.   His  MajestyV Government  called  attention in a  telegram  to Sir, R.  Rodd of20th July to the serious position in regard  to  the supply of coal to Italy.   While  the monthly necessities approximate to 700,000 tons, only about 372,000 tons are received.His Majesty&apos;s Government suggested in this telegram that the method by which coalis supplied to Italy requires reconsideration,  and asked whether  the  Italian Govern-ment have complained about the matter.  In  reply Sir R. Rodd refers  to the factthat the subject has  been  dealt  with  by urgent  telegrams from his Embassy forthe past six months.  The position taken up  by the Italian Minister  for  the Interiorwhen in London showed that  the  minimum  monthly  requirements of Italy in Maylast were 700,000 tons,  which by  closing factories wre&apos;re subsequently reduced to690,000 tons.   The Minister of Transports will not receive more than 390,000 tons-from England  during July, so that a deficit of 300,000 tons is apparent.   The  needs for August consequently represent 690,000 tons in addition to the  300,000 tons to-replace the reserves.   The small stock which  was held as a reserve in the  country isnow  exhausted, and  the result has been a  reduction in  the  output of  guns  andammunition and a considerable  danger to the  maintenance of military  communica-tions.   Apart from the military  requirements, it appears that the  Italian  government consider that the civil population will  be so affected  by the shortage that they aremaking arrangements to transfer those  inhabiting Northern Italy  to the South inorder that they may be in a warmer climate during the  winter.  A suggestion hasbeen made to  the Italian  authorities that they might endeavour to secure  coal  direct from America, hut Sir C. Spring Rice points out that the policy adopted, in accordancewith the views of the Shipping Controller  and the  Admiralty, has been to induce theUnited States to send vessels to England  with general cargo,  and then  utilise themfor carrying coal from England  to Italy.  He  adds that 70,000 tons of American  coalhave been supplied to Italy every month for some time past, and if he now urges theUnited States to send coal direct, it  would  be  a reversal of  the policy  previouslypressed upon them.
                                   &apos; GREECE.   Tlie Government  of  M. Venizelos,  though not  desiring&quot; to carry oat  reprisals,intend to inflict  appropriate  punishment  on those  who perpetrated the outrages onthe Venizelists last December.   M. Venizelos,  while accepting King Alexanders  position on the throne, intends tomake the limits  of his authority perfectly clear on  the re-assembling of Parliament.In the report which  accompanies the decree calling  the  Members of the Chambertogether, it is stated  &quot;the  will of the people, as  expressed by the Chamber, and not that of the Sovereign, regulates the policy of Parliamentary Governments.&quot;   The King,it is stated, is &quot;the  hereditary head of a  republic.&quot;  The position will be made stillmore clear  in the Speech from the Throne when Parliament meets, and if KingAlexander should object  to the line taken, M. Venizelos would probably go the lengthof replacing him by Prince Paul and a  Regency.   MWenizelos intends calling  up the  1916 and 1917  classes for military service.He states that there are already 60,000 Greek troops in the field, and that the leviesfrom the Islands will  bring this number up to 100,000.  The  Greek Chief of the staff has expressed the view that eight divisions can be mobilised in about three months,apart from the  three existing divisions of  the Provisional  Government  Army  andwithout taking into account the 40,000 recruits which the 19 L6 and  1917  classes areexpected to produce.   Though  the French  agree to evacuate Athens,  piraeus and the Gulf of Corinthbefore 23rd July, while remaining at Larissa, it has not been possible to carry this intoeffect on account  of the limitations of the  Greek railways.  The evacuation of allied troops will probably not  have  taken  place completely till the end of duly.  It has beenarranged that Pirams will be the centre of distribution of cargoesso that rapidity maybe increased.   The Italian Minister for Foreign Affairs inquired  on the 21st July concerning arumoured French landing  of troops  opposite Corfu, but this  was  at once  denied.Negotiations  have taken place regarding  the Italian  occupation of  Epirus, and theItalian Government have agreed to  withdraw  their troops at the same time  as theFrench, from all parts excepting from the angle where the road  to Monastir forms anenclave.   While suggesting that the troops should be withdrawn, M. Venizelos allowsthat as some  French &quot;Cavalry patrols will be left, the  Italian Cavalry might similarlypatrol the Sauti Quaranta Road.  In the event of the  Italian Government  refusing toaccept this suggestion, a difficult situation may arise, which  will probably  necessitateM.  Venizelos appealing  to all the  Allies.   (See  on  this, head Intelligence Bureau,weekly report, 21st July  1917.)   Mr.  Crackanthorpe has telegraphed the outlines  of a scheme,  which has been presented  to the  Allied   Legations  by  delegates  on  the  Inter-Allied PassportBureau, in modification  of the Control  system.  In  the proposals put forward, itis  suggested that a  Greek officer in  charge of  the Greek Passport Bureau  should serve as a member  of  the- Inter-Allied Bureau.  The British, French, and Italiandelegates would give  their  visa to travellers proceeding to  their respective countries,while  the  Greek officer  would give  Laisser  passer  to  places  in  Greece  which,though not occupied by  the military,  are  places  of importance in  connection withsubmarines or spies.  It  appears that the French Government wish for the completeabandonment of all foreign Controls and  they consider this has already  taken placeso far as France  is concerned.  The British War Office agree  to the withdrawal of controls, but they wish to  see the matter dealt with  in a gradual  way.  They wouldlike  to see the Greek Government  in charge of the arrangements, assisted by  theadvice of experienced officers  of the Allies.  In this way  the control  and visa ofpassports would be dealt with in Greece in much the -same way as in other countries.The Vice-Admiral raises no difficulty  regarding the withdrawal of Controls from  the mainland, but suggests  that  the Islands will have to be  dealt with separately.  he considers that the present system should be maintained at  Salonica and in  the Islandsoccupied by  the Allies.                              GERMAN AFFAIRS.    The  speech of the  Imperial Chancellor,  Herr Michaelis,  in  the Reichstag on19th July, has  overshadowed  other matters.   Speaking of the  submarine campaign,      344-1-4                            C
Herr Michaelis said in the  course of his speech :  &quot; We fling hack the reproach that&quot; the U-boat  war  is contrary to International Law and  transgresses the rights  of&quot; humanity.   England  forced the weapon into  our  bands  by her illegal blockade&quot; which prevented neutral  commerce  with  Germany and  proclaimed, a  war&quot; of&quot; starvation ...... I affirm  that U-boat war and its destruction of enemy tonnage&quot; accomplishes what it ought to accomplish.  It  injures England&apos;s economic position&quot; and. her conduct of the war from month to month  in  an increasing degree, so that&quot; it will not he much longer possible for her to oppose the  need of peace.&quot; lief erringto Germany&apos;s  Allies, the Chancellor said :  &quot; The comradeship in arms which has been&quot; forged and  tested in  hot battles will  not be sundered.  Germany is faithful to the&quot; Alliance and  will hold fast to treaties and agreements.&quot;  With  reference to thepeace  Germany wants,  Herr Michaelis  said : &quot; Germany  did not want war, and did&quot; not strive after  the forcible  expansion  of her  power.    Therefore she will not&quot; continue to wage war  a single  day longer after an honourable peace is obtainable,&quot; merely to make conquests by force.  What we  ought primarily to do is to conclude&quot; peace as men who have successfully carried through their purpose. .  .  .  For me,&quot; the following aims  result: in the  first  place, the territory of  the Fatherland  is&quot;inviolable; with  an  enemy who demands portions  of  our territory we  cannot&quot; negotiate.  If wre make peace we must primarily make sure that the frontiers of the&quot; German Empire  are  made secure for all time.  We must, by way of agreement and&quot; compromise guarantee the  conditions of existence of the German Empire .011 the&quot; Continent and overseas. &apos; Peace must be the basis for the lasting reconciliation of&quot; the nations.   It  must, as is stated in your resolution, prevent further aggression&quot; and hostility among nations through  economic barriers, and provide  a safeguard&quot; that the armed Alliance of our  enemies does npt develop into an economic offensive&quot; against us.....  We cannot  offer peace again.   The  hand outstretched once in&quot; honest readiness for peace grasped the empty air. But the entire people, the Army, and&quot; the Government  are agreed that if  our enemy  abandon their lust of conquest and&quot; their  aims of subjugation and wish to enter into negotiations, we shall in honest&quot; readiness for  peace, listen  to what they have  to say to  us.   Until then we must&quot; persevere calmly, patiently and courageously.&quot;    Referring  to the food  supplies, the  Chancellor  admitted the serious position.&quot;The present time,&quot;  he declared,  &quot;is  the severest we have experienced, and the&quot; month of July has been the  worst.   The  drought has delayed growth,  and bitter&quot; want exists in many cases, but I  can declare with  glad confidence  that relief will&quot; shortly set in.  .  . . Nothing certain can yet be said about  the harvest,  but the fact&quot; is already established to-day that the harvest of. bread com will be better than  is&quot; believed.  Straw is  indeed short,  but the development  of  the  cereal  crops  is&quot; excellent, and we shall, as in 1915, reckon upon an average harvest.  We hope for&quot; a good potato crop, and if we utilise the increase from Rumania and other territories&quot; carefully, the  shortage of fodder &quot;with, which  wre  should  otherwise be confronted&quot; will be overcome,  it has been proved  in these  three war years that even in case of&quot; a bad harvest, as in 1916,  Germany can in no way  be starved  out.  With stringent&quot; management  and low rationing,  the  supplies will suffice.&quot;   With  reference  to constitutional  matters,  the  Chancellor called attention to the desirability of closer relations between Parliament and the Government, and he indicated the establishmentof a system  of  summoning to the leading  offices men who  enjoy the full confidence of the great parties in the popular assembly..  &quot; But,&quot; he stated, &quot; all this, of course, is&quot; possible, only provided the other side recognise that the  constitutional right of the&quot; Imperial Government to direct policy must not be curtailed.&quot;  He added that hewas not willing that the  conduct of affairs&apos;should be taken  from his hands.   At  the  conclusion  of the  Chancellors  speech,  Herr Fehrenbach (Centre Party)presented the joint Resolution in the  name of the Centre Progressives and the social democrats.  Herr  Scheidemann (Social Democrat) said that he wished  other people would  understand  that Germany  was   not  aiming at the acquisition  of foreignpossessions, and that she was ready for  a righteous  peace secured by  Internationallegal guarantees.   He further stated  that Prussian electoral reform must come this.autumn,  and  that  the  Socialists  demanded the deliverance of  the  Press from the censorship.  Herr von  Payer (leader of the South German People&apos;s Party) expressedconfidence that Herr Michaelis would regard a peace of agreement and  compromiseas better than a prolongation of the war at any price.  He asserted that in homepolitics  there  was a  growing  concensus  of  opinion that conditions should  bedemocratised.   Count Westarp (Conservative) stated  that  &quot; to victory alone  will we
n  &quot; owe peace . .  .   Germany will be prepared  for peace  negotiations as soon as  its  &quot; enemies  unreservedly renounce  their demands  for  forcible annexations  or  for  &quot; indemnities. . .   Our country&apos;s frontiers  must for all  times  be  better protected.&quot;  He asserted that the  proposed peace Resolution was calculated  to  stiffen the courage  of  the enemy and to prolong  the  war, and for  this  reason &quot; we  Conservatives  unanimously reject it.&quot;  Prince  SohSnaich-Garolath  (National Liberal Party)  stated  that his Party resolutely and unanimously rejected  the resolution, though he agreed  with the statement occurring in the Speech from the Throne of the 4th August 1914,  that &quot; we are not impelled by desire of conquest.&quot;  PierrHaase (Independent Socialist)  alleged that Dr. Michaelis  was the trusted agent  of Hindenburg and  Ludendorff.  &quot; Are  these men  by any chance against annexations ? &quot; he asked,  and continued :  &quot; The whole  of  our political  life  is  permeated  with  Prussian militarism.  The  &quot; Parliament takes all its  high-handed  behaviour  lying down.  . .  .  Monarchical  &quot; institutions have been weighed in the balance  and  found  wanting.  We must  &quot; have a Republic.&quot;   While recognising that the  Resolution put  forward by the  ^Centre Parties was a distinct step forward from the  aimexationist position previously  adopted, Herr Haase  criticised its  form and concluded: &quot;Above  all,  there is  no  word in it about the right of nations  to choose their own  rulers.&quot;   On the vote being-  taken, the Reichstag adopted the Resolution as presented  by a majority of 214 to 116,  there being 17 abstentions.      The &quot; Hamburger Fremdenblatt &quot;  of 18th July published a telegram from Admiral  von Tirpitz to Herr Bassermann1 (leader of  the National  Liberal Party), in which  he  states  that he learns that the Party rejected the peace Resolution, &quot;which would have  meant for us a peace absolutely fatal,  that is, peace without indemnities.&quot;   He adds :  &quot; I appeal to you,  in memory of our common labour for  the  German  people, to put  every obstacle in the way of the peace Resolution.&quot;      The &quot;Frankfurter Zeitung,&quot; commenting on the division in the Reichstag, put the  following question : &quot; How can anyone after yesterday&apos;s vote still assert that it is not  &quot; the Prime Ministers intention to restore  Belgium to  her political  and economic  &quot;independence?&quot;  The &quot;Vorwarts&quot; of 20th July wrote a  critical leader on the  Chancellor^ speech  under  the heading  &quot;Was it  wise?&quot;  Referring to the peace  Resolution,  it stated that Herr Michaelis  &quot; accepted  it very half-heartedly, and  a half-  &quot; hearted man cannot lead the  Empire in these times.   .   .  .   The peace programme  &quot; of the Reichstag is the expression of the  will of the German people.&quot;   It further  stated, that the Chancellor was  not wise  in  stating that he was not minded to let the  direction of affairs pass out of his  hands  at  the moment wdien the Reichstag  was  practically taking  over that  direction.      From information conveyed by the Swiss Minister for Foreign Affairs, it appears  that the harvest in the west of  Germany is expected  to be fair, but that the harvests  in the east and in  the north will be attended with bad results.  The Rumanian harvest  has been of such an excellent character that the Central Empires are now confident of*  being  able to provide for their requirements until the 1918 harvest.      A.  statement by General  Ludendorff in relation to the submarine campaign,  is  quoted by the Berlin Wolff Bureau to this effect: &quot; In waging U-boat war the ultimate  &quot; desire of the Chief Army Command was to hit the  enemy&apos;s war industry, especially  &quot; his production of ammunition.  Our Western armies  have experienced important  &quot; relief  from  the  U-boat,  and the  production  of  enemy munitions has  been  &quot; diminished.&quot;      The &quot;Deutsche Tageszeitung &quot; of 21st July states that potatoes have not yet been  delivered to the increased extent that  was anticipated.  It is expected, however, that  in the  coming week the deliveries to  Berlin will enable rations to be  increased.  The  general flour ration of 170 grammes per head will be raised at  the  middle of August  to  220 grammes  daily, while  the  meat  ration of  250   grammes  weekly, given  to  supplement the flour ration, will be discontinued.                          ALLIED  ENEMY AFFAIRS.    The  &quot; Deutsche  Tageszeitung &quot; of 21st July announced that a meeting of  the austro-German Commission was to begin at Vienna on 23rd July in order to continuethe discussions, which were commenced last year, on trade relations after the w-ar.1 The death of Herr Bassermnnn is reported to have taken place at Baden-Baden on 24th July.
   M. Naoum,  formerly Greek Minister at Sofia,  has been  received  by  Sir  H.Kumbold, and in the course of an interview stated that it was hopeless to expect todetach  Bulgaria from  her Allies.  The Bulgarians  were  entirety in the grip ofGermany, though if they were  defeated  on  the Macedonian front  he admitted thesituation would be altered.  The King, he added, though not much in  the country,was responsible  for matters of policy.                                SWITZERLAND.   Discussions have taken place with  the German delegates as to the new German-Swiss agreement.   Owing to. internal  necessities  and the  difficulties of obtaininglabour, it appears that Germany will not be  in a position to continue to supply thepresent amount of coal  to Switzerland.  The deliveries of iron will also be materiallyreduced.                                   HOLLAND.    With reference to the capture of the German merchantmen by British  destroyers (vide Report  No. 25),  the  Netherlands  Ministry of  Marine  have  published  a communique stating that in the early morning of 16th  July seven German merchant ships Avere seen proceeding through territorial waters.  At 6.15  the coastguard  saw 20 foreign warships  which fired at the merchantmen within  territorial  waters.  A Customs  boat,  recognising  18 British destroyers,  placed  herself  between  the merchantmen and the destroyers.   It is established, the communique continues, that the attack took place within territorial waters.   Commenting on the incident, the &quot; Nieuwe Rotterdam  Courant &quot; says:   &quot; It  should  be  known in  Germany  that, &quot; after the manner in which Germany has waged war at sea, there are not ten people &quot; in this country who get warm  over the fate of six German ships. ...  It  may be &quot; expected Britain  will  make  no  serious  difficulties about  returning  the captured &quot; ships  and  giving  satisfaction for the attack.&quot;   The  &quot; Vaderland &quot;  of  19th  July observes : &quot; Assuming that  a mistake was made, we must still assume that Britain  will &quot; take the blame.  But that is not  enough. It  is Britain&apos;s  duty to give back the &quot; captured ships.&quot;  On 20th July the matter was  referred to  in the R,eichstag, when Herr  Kriege,  Director of the Imperial  Foreign Office, said that by &quot; satisfaction&quot; Germany meant the immediate return of the ships  taken in Netherlands waters,  and indemnification  for the  ships sunk, for the wounded and for the  families of those killed.  He asserted that the Netherlands Government were prepared to  do everything to prevent a repetition of such an incident,  and  they were firmly determined  to insist on  the satisfaction which was awaited by Germany.  The &quot; liandelsblad &quot; refers to the tone adopted in the Reichstag as &quot; seriously presumptuous,&quot; and continues : &quot;How &quot; can a  country which  destroy-s our ships withot.it show of right  . .  . take a  high &quot; hand  in demanding  compensation for the wrongful destruction of a  coitple of her &quot; ships?&quot;  His Majesty  the King,  in telegraphing to the Queen  of the Netherlands, mentions  that  the incident will have the  careful consideration of British Ministers directly a full report has come.to hand.    With regard to the  .area which the Admiralty have  decided to leave free  from mines for the benefit of Dutch shipping (vide.Report No. 25), His Majesty the King, in the telegram to the  Queen of  the Netherlands  to which reference is made above, states his pleasure at observing  the satisfaction which the concession has caused in Holland.  In  the course of  observations the &quot; Handelsblad &quot; says :  &quot;it shows that &quot; those who thought the  whole object of the  British Government was to hamper Dutch &quot; shipping were wrong.&quot;    His Majesty&apos;s Government have  expressed to  the Netherlands Government&apos;their profound regret at the  mistake which resulted in the dropping of bombs on Ziericksee, and have given  an assurance that  all possible precautions will be taken to  prevent- such  occurrences in the future.  Compensation is  offered for the  damage  caused.&quot;The &quot; Handelsblad &quot;  expresses satisfaction over the British acknowledgment.
   Sir W. Tovvnley expresses the view that  the  stoppage of the supplies of fodderwill  have a serious effect in the country, and will necessitate  the slaughter of about30 per cent, of cattle and 95 per cent, of  sheep,  and half the poultry and pigs.  Hetakes the view that,  if  this should result, a large  portion  of the  meat that is notwanted in Holland will be sent to Germany.   The method adopted of appointing a Commission to enquire  into the case of theinterned  German submarines is reported by Sir W. Townley as affording an opportunityto the Dutch Government  to  agree to  the German attitude.  He  suggests that theNetherlands Government should be informed that the  Commission will not providea method of escaping responsibility, and that  this must be remembered by them if the submarines are released.  The Commission  has  now completed  its  labours, and SirW. Townley thinks,  from the  interview he  has  had with the Minister for ForeignAffairs, that the boats  will be released.   The Minister further  stated  that he was willing to submit the matter to arbitration.   The Netherlands Government have arranged to despatch, a mission to the UnitedStates  to discuss questions of supplies of  food and raw materials to Holland.  the origin  of this move was apparently  a telegram from the Netherlands Minister atWashington asking for information m order that  the case of Holland could be put inthe most favourable light to the American public.                                   SWEDEN.   Sir E. Howard wishes to know whether it is the policy  of His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment to  prevent the importation of lubricants to Sweden  excepting for those firms which are  working in  the  interests of the  Allies.   He  suggests that  it would  be inadvisable wholly to prevent lubricants  reaching those firms which are engaged  on home production, as it would mean closing a number  of factories and the  throwingout of employment of a great  many  people.   He  is  not,  however,  averse to theSwedish  Government being told that  firms engaged  in  work  for the Allies will receive preferential treatment.   Sir E. Howard also calls attention to the fact that  he informed the Minister for Foreign Affairs that unless  His Majesty&apos;s  Government sawthat  the  fishing  export restrictions  were efficient,  they would not facilitate  theimportation of lubricants, and   it was  no doubt gathered  from this that when the fishing matter was put right, the importation of oil would,be  resumed. It is suggestedtherefore, as desirable that, if new conditions are to  be imposed, they had better  bebased upon the requirements of the United States.   It has been pointed out to Sir E. Howard that efforts have been made to persuade the United States to adopt a firm attitude  regarding embargoes on exports to Sweden,especially in relation to iron ore and pulp, and that  it is necessary  that  similar conditions  should be imposed  upon the exports to that country  which are  under british control.                                   NORWAY.   It  has been  suggested by  Mr.  Ovey that, as  he understands  the  GermanGovernment are endeavouring to improve their exchange situation amongst  neutralsby exporting gold, it  would be well if  an effort  were made to prevent this  being done.  He thinks that the banks in the  Scandinavian countries are  not  desirous ofincreasing their gold, and if it were pointed out that the more  gold  Germany  sendsaway the less chance will there be of Belgium receiving an indemnity, they may be disposed to abandon any help to Germany in this  connection.                :                  DENMARK.   If fat-stuffs are not sent from Denmark in increasing quantities,  Germany hasthreatened to cut off supplies of iron, coal, salt and petroleum.  The Danish Ministerfor Foreign Affairs states  that the German  argument  is  that, as the importation of    3441-4                              D
fodder-stuffs  from the United Kingdom has been abandoned, Denmark is not tinderany  obligations to His Majesty&apos;s Government.  In reporting upon the visit of the danish delegates to England, Mr. Sonhe  stated that he did not see how the Germanargument could be answered.  In  a note which the Danish Government have addressedto His Majesty&apos;s Government, it  is pointed out that the importation of fodder-stuffshad hitherto provided  Denmark with an  answer to the German demands, as it waspossible  to state  that the importation  of fodder would be discontinued if increasestook place in the exports to Germany.  Even now the German  attitude is beingresisted in the hope that the British decision maybe altered.  Meantime His Majesty&apos;sGovernment  have notified their  pleasure that the  export of cattle to Germany hasbeen reduced to 5,000 head a week, aud  have  expressed the hope  that these  exportsmay be  still further reduced.  In order to help the Danish farmers in reducing their exports to Germany, His  Majesty&apos;s  Government state that they are contemplating a method, of assistance towards freight  charges  in connection with  butter  and bacon,but as regards the importation of fodder, this matter is deferred for discussion.                                     SPAIN.   The meeting of the Catalan assembly called by the Parliamentarists  was held atBarcelona privately on 19th July amidst some excitement in the town.  The  meetingpassed Resolutions calling upon the Government to dissolve the Cortes and to institute a National or non-party Government.   Failure to respond to these demands wall,  itis asserted, involve  a  general strike;  this  has already begun at  A^alencia,  whererailway and shipping  work  has been stopped and  business nearly brought to a standstill.   The military, however, have taken charge, and indications point to thestrike  terminating.   Sir A.  Hardinge considers that for  the present  moment theGovernment have been morally victorious.   The Prime  Minister  states that theCatalan movement&apos; has been  suppressed, and that there was  not any  intention ofarresting  the Parliamentarists.   He asserts  that the Cortes  will  be  dissolved inAugust,  and that a General  Election will take place  in September.  The result, heanticipates,  will provide the present  Government with a substantial majority.   TheBritish Consul  at Barcelona does not agree with  the Prime Ministers remarks, andbelieves that orders were given to arrest the Parliamentarists.  He understands  thatthe  King of Sixain  intends to  dismiss the present Government, and thus avoid ageneral strike, but Sir  A. Hardinge thinks that the Government still possesses theconfidence of the  King, and that  the more responsible  elements in the  populationwish to see  the restoration of order and the constitutional matter left over till the endof the war.   The majority of the Municipalities in Catalonia support  the Resolutionsthat were passed at the meeting of the Parliamentarists.   Sir A. Hardinge states that he is doing all that is possible to dispose of the reports,which  he attributes  to  Germany, that His Majesty&apos;s  Government have  been taking-part in the  revolutionary movement.  He has talked to the King and  Minister forForeign Affairs on the  subject, and has  offered to help them in  finding out the  truthof the  matter.   It is reported from  Monte Video that the village of Culera, near Port Bou, is  being used as a base for German submarines.   Colonel  House has pointed out to Lord Northcliffe in an interview that has  takenplace in the United States, that the influence of Spain  in  war matters  has  not been sufficiently considered, more especially in relation to South America.  Colonel Housemade  the suggestion  that His  Majesty&apos;s Government should  agree with the UnitedStates  to send two capable representatives to Spain who, though apparently travellingon commercial  business, might carry out propagandist  work in  a confidential manner.                                  PORTUGAL.   The President of the Republic is much concerned that His Majesty&apos;s Governmentshould  consider it necessary that the ex-enemy ships should be offered as security for the  proposed  loan.   The  President  indicates  that it is  very  hurtful  that security should be asked for at a time when Portugal has sent her troops, which have
                                       3 5been highly praised, to fight with  the  British.  He  expresses  concern that  historyshould have to.record this  evidence of want of  confidence in  the credit of Portugal.His  Majesty&apos;s  Government  have, however, pointed out to Sir L.  Carnegie,  for the informal ion of  the  President,  that  the  security  referred to was  proposed by thePortuguese Government.                                     CHINA.    The  formation  of  the  new Cabinet, from  which  Radicals  are  excluded,  was-completed on 18th July.  The British, French, Japanese and Russian representatives were received by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and again stated  the  wish of all their Governments that war should be declared on the Central Powrers.   The JapaneseMinister for Foreign Affairs believes that Tuan Chi-jui will shortly be  in need offinancial  assistance  in order to carry on the Government,  and  suggests  that theJapanese Government might make a loan of  1,000,000 3Ten.   To this suggestion HisMajesty&apos;s Government have agreed, but have  asked to be informed as to the conditionsof the loan.  The Japanese Foreign Minister  believes that Tuan Chi-jui will be willingto  declare war  on Germany, and that if General Feng would come  to Peking  and support him as President the position would be  much improved.  Feng has  still alarge military force  at Nanking.  As to  the position of Chang Hsiin, it is  believedthat his complicity with Germany and Austria can be demonstrated, and the JapaneseForeign Minister  considers  that the  Allies  should force China to  declare  war onAustria.  The position is by no means cleared up, and it is possible, in  the view ofthe same authority, that the  present  state of uncertainty in China may continue forsome time.                                    JAPAN.   The Japanese Government have been informed that, as it is impossible to produceat home enough hematite pig-iron to enable the  necessities of the steel  works inthis  country  to be met,  it  would be  well if they  could obtain  the amount they require from the United  States.  His Majesty&apos;s Government particularly regret thatthey  cannot  provide  Japan  with this and other materials they require, as it isnecessary to place an  important request before  the  Japanese authorities.  This, in short, is  to ask the Japanese Government to take all possible action to overcome thesubmarine menace by assuming control  over their merchant shipping, so that some ofit  may be used for war purposes in the  manner adopted  by the other Allies. .  As an example  of the kind of help which could be given, the transport of Chinese coolies toVancouver is cited.   This, it is stated, wall  be  much interfered with unless Japaneseships can be  utilised  from  1st  September to transport the coolies at the rate of5,000 a month.                                     SIAM.    On 22nd July the Government of Siam informed the German and Austrian repre-sentatives at Bangkok  of  the  declaration of war.   The King issued a proclamation,and all enemy subjects of military age were interned and  nine  German steamshipsseized.   With regard to the latter, an attempt was  made to damage the machinery onthe approach of the Siamese boats, and  all the  German vessels, with the exception ofthree, had bombs on board for the purpose.  However, only small explosions  occurred,though the Germans, who made no resistance,  succeeded in setting fire to two ships.This was speedily extinguished by the Siamese  sailors.BRAZIL.    With  regard to the  suggestion  of  the partial  relaxation of the  embargo  on.Brazilian coffee if it  is sent in any of  the ships formerly belonging  to Germany,.      34-11-4                              E
(vide Report No. 23), the Brazilian Government will not  submit to this  stipulation,..and prefer to abandon the proffered advantage for coffee.  The Brazilian Minister has informed Sir A. Peel that the ex-German ships and all  Brazilian vessels are under theauthority  of  the  Ministry of the  Treasury.  The  Brazilian Lloyd vessels are thusbrought under different management.                                    MEXICO.   The Ambassador of  the United States  in Mexico is  on his way from America toMexico, and has informed Sir 0. Spring Rice that he is conveying a warning from thePresident that if Carranza attacks the oilfields it will be considered a vital  matter to-the United States, and will probably involve war.                               UNITED  STATES.   In an interview  which Sir C. Spring Rice has  had with Mr. McAdoo (vide ReportNo. 25), emphasis  was laid  on the fact that His Majesty&apos;s Government could notdischarge indebtedness in the United States from any funds which were not furnished by that country, while any failure  of the  United Kingdom  to  meet  the liabilitiesincurred would have the most serious effect upon the position general!y.  The UnitedStates Secretary to the Treasury indicated that difficulties as to meeting the payments would  be adjusted, and he is  providing $ 185,000,000 for July, and  will probablyallow a similar sum for  August.   With regard  to the overdraft of  $400,OUO,000,Mr. McAdoo pointed out the political difficulty of a loan to  His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwhich could be characterised as accommodating Messrs. Morgan.   As to future arrangements  connected with finance and purchases in the UnitedStates, Mr. McAdoo has put forward  definite proposals for the formation  of a EuropeanAllied Council wdiose duty it would  be to acquaint a  Purchasing Commission in theUnited  States  as  to the respective necessities of the Powers  in relation  to  food,.munitions, &amp;c, and  as to matters  of priority  and  transport.   Similar information should be given regarding probable loans required for periods up to 12 months ahead,.and  on receiving the suggestions of the  Council the President and Secretary to theTreasury would then  be in-a position to judge how they could act.  It  is pointed outthat an estimate of fresh loans will help  the Government, though it must not beassumed that  they will  necessarily agree  to  proposals that may be  put  forward.The financial arrangements  for August  can be  dealt  with, but matters after that month should be  transacted through  the  Council, and for this reason the UnitedStates  authorities wish to see  the  Council  set on  foot  before  15th  August.   Theimportance   of  this  time  limit  arises  from  the  fact  that  the last pa3rinentswill be  made under the old  arrangements  by  15th August, and  the  sanction of  Congress must  be obtained for future loans.    To  obtain  this  the Secretaryto  the  Treasury must  be  able  to  prove  that all  steps  have  been  taken  toensure  that  the money to be  advanced shall  be utilised  to  the best advantage  in  &apos;meeting the necessities of the Allies.   M. Tardieu  has expressed  himself in favour  ofthe  scheme, as it seems to carry  out  the views of the Conference  of the AlliedCommissioners  of  9th July.  He  pointed out at a  meeting on  22nd July, when theItalian, Russian, and British Ambassadors were present, that it was necessary for theAllies to co-ordinate their demands.   The Russian and. Italian Ambassadors,  however,did  not approve of  the exclusion  of  the Allies from a part in the formation of theproposed Purchasing Commission.   In order to give practical effect to  the suggestedarrangements so far as the United Kingdom is concerned,  Mr. McAdoo  has forwardedthe draft of  a proposed agreement  with His Majesty&apos;s Government providing for theappointment of a  representative having authority  to  buy on behalf  of  the BritishGovernment, and the setting up of a Commission, to be nominated by the Presidentof  the United States, through  whom all purchases for Great Britain must be made.In  contemplation of the Governments of  the different Powers, or British Dominions orColonies, desiring to enter into.the same agreement, it is laid down that reqiurementsand priorities must be arranged between them, but it is stipulated that  the agreement shall not render the United States  liable  to advance  money, or be construed as  an admission by the United  States of the  legality of war measures taken by other Powers-which have not been hitherto accepted by the American Government.
   In  reply to the  suggestions  for  the proposed  European Allied Council, HisMajesty&apos;s Government have informed Sir C. Spring  Rice that the matter has beenunder consideration by the Cabinet.  While agreeing to accept  at  once the proposedAllied  Council in London  for   the  purpose  of co-ordinating  the demands  for american  supplies,  His  Majesty&apos;s  Government point  out  that  the duties  ofthe  Council would apparently fall  under  three heads, namely, Supply,  finance and  Transport.   As  to Supply,  they suggest  that  food and   munitions  shouldbe   dealt  with separately.    With  regard  to   Finance,  His  Majesty&apos;s  Govern-ment  do  not  think  that  the  Allies,  could jointly  agree  upon  their  financialrequirements  in the Avay suggested.    It is  recalled that  in July  1916,  a  JointConference of xMlied  Finance Ministers was held in London, and  was  uuabie  todo anything beyond  passing some general Resolutions.   The actual allocation  ofcredits   was  then left  to  be  determined   by  separate  meetings  between  theChancellor of  the Exchequer  and   each  of  the  Finance  Ministers  concerned.Though  this  method  may  be   inconvenient,  a  Conference  of  Ministers   with no   one   to   judge  of   the  importance  of  the   respective   claims   madecould  not lead to any practical result.   His  Majesty&apos;s  Government, therefore,consider that the United States will have to deal as at present with each Ally separately in matters of finance.  With reference to  transport,  His Majesty&apos;s  Governmentare  in  accord with the views of  the  United States as to the importance of onlydealing  with  those  orders  which   can be shipped  with  reasonable  certainty.But  at the same time it is impossible to foresee even four months ahead  the amountof shipping which it  will  be possible to allot to   any particular Ally.  While  recog-recognising therefore, their responsibility towards the  Alliance, His Majesty&apos;s  Governmentstate that they must retain liberty of action in relation to their own shipping, so thatthey may allocate tonnage month by month as the military, naval and  economicsituations determine.   It  will, in  consequence,  be impossible to deal  with  british shipping through the Inter-Allied Council, and each Ally must be dealt with separately.Regret is expressed, that the  United States are   not in favour of appointing a repre-sentative on the proposed Council, and  it is  hoped  that this decision may  be recon-sidered.   His Majesty&apos;s Government  wish  to discuss further the arrangements inrelation  to  supply,  on  the lines laid down by Mr.  McAdoo ;   and   they  accept this  suggestions regarding a Purchasing Commission in America.    Mr. McAdoo further amplified his position in a cable to the United States ambassador in  London (sent  to Lord Northcliffe on 20th July), in the course of which he says that only temporary  measures can be taken until he  has a full knowledge  of  theposition in Europe.  In this message he denies  that any undertaking has ever beengiven that the United States would furnish money for the Morgan  overdraft, but he islooking intb the matter.  He  indicates  that the policy of the United States wall be tomaintain  liberty of action  in financial matters,  but to assist  the Allies  in all wayspossible.  He warns the British Government, however,  that America cannot undertake the  entire burden of financing  the  war.   Mr.  McAdoo  wishes  to  know if lord northcliffe is the  duly accredited financial representative of His Majesty&apos;s Government,as the number of  those who purport to speak for  the British authorities is apt to leadto confusion.     As  the question  of  the liability  for military service  of  the subjects  of  AlliedPowers  resident in the United States is being  taken up by Congress, Sir  C.  SpringRice suggests the possibility of  a Convention between  the United States and GreatBritain  which will extend  reciprocal rights of  enlisting the citizens of the  respective countries.     Sir  G. Spring Rice has  made enquiries  about  the possible establishment of aBritish Naval and Military Mission (vide Report No. 25), but he is not able to reportany wish for the presence  of officers of  high  standing  in this  connection.  Thetraining camps are receiving technical assistance from a number of Canadian officers. The only  alteration he  can suggest  in the  present  arrangements would be to send to the United States some junior officers skilled in torpedo and gunnery work.     In the course of an interview with  Lord Northcliffe,  Colonel House stated that the people  of the United States were not convinced that His Majesty&apos;s Government were taking all the steps that efficiency demanded to overcome the submarine menace.  It is thought that  the submarines  which are attacking  transports from the United States are obtaining oil from bases in Spain.    In this connection Lord Northcliffe  considers that Dr. Wilson should  be furnished with  full and  accurate  information concerningthe submarine position.   He  believes that this is the on by method by which  the  full
help of America can. be  obtained, as the feeling  at  present inclines  to.  regard thesubmarine difficulty as one that is being surmounted.  The New York Chamber ofCommerce have called  a meeting to discuss the  submarine situation, and  it  appearsthat the feeling in thai  city is in favour of  a greater amount of information being-given to the public by  His Majesty&apos;s Government.  If  this is done, it is believed thatship construction will be increased and a termination  put  to the  differences between general Goethals and Mr. Denman (vide Report No. 25).                         THE SHIPPING SITUATION.    The Swedish Government have sent a strong protest to Berlin with regard to the sinking of Swedish fishing boats (vide Report  No.  25) and demanding  compensation.There is official evidence to the effect that the  action complained  of occurred outsidethe danger zone.    Sir E. Howard has presented the views of  His Majesty&apos;s Government regardingoutside-port calling facilities to the Minister for Foreign Affairs (vide Report No. 25).The Minister had that  morning (18th July)  held  a  Conference with leading  ship-owners,  and he  pointed  out that it  was not advisable to adopt a  general shipping-policy until they could be certain of cargoes for the vessels.  Upon this Sir E. Howardobserved  that the continued postponement of shipping matters until import arrange-ments had been  decided would  lead  to  endless  delay.  In the result  a reply waspromised to the views  put forward by His Majesty&apos;s Government.    It is  reported from Norway that by way of reprisals for the  action taken by theAllies in connection with the war by sea, Germany has issued a proclamation statingthat a neutral ship will be considered an enemy if it  is armed  mainly by enemy subjects or chartered by or trading for an enemy.                             PEACE DISCUSSIONS.    Sir E. Howard has heard from  one  of the Russian delegates now in Stockholmthat the Sovyet will hold the Peace Conference  on  15th August,  notwithstanding thepossible absence of representatives from the United Kingdom and France.  The sameauthority is responsible for  the  statement that the  German majority and  minoritySocialists have already agreed to be present at the Conference, and  that the Russianswill meet them.  The latter foel confident of  being able to induce British and FrenchLabour  Associations  to send  delegates.   It  is reported  that the  German  majoritySocialists have informed  the  Sovyet  that they have  always&apos; opposed the  policy ofannexations,&apos; and since  April have  declared  themselves as in  agreement  with theSovyet views as to the necessary foundations for peace.  When accepting the invitation to the Peace Conference, the German Majority Socialists agreed to treat the  decisions as binding, provided  that they are applicable also to  other belligerent  countries. Mr. Branting has asked  for  the  use of Parliament House for  the  purposes  of  the Conference on 15th August, but the Swedish  authorities  have refused permission  on. the ground that the use of an  official building might convey the impression that the Conference was itself official.  In any event, however, Parliament will be  in session at the time, and  this alone would prevent the loan of the buildings.     The Dutch Scandinavian Committee deny that the date of the Conference has been altered through the decision of the Fi-ench Socialists.     The  Italian  Government have refused permission to the Socialist  Delegates to visit Stockholm, and they  have requested the  British  Passport Office likewise to refuse any facilities if they should be asked for.     The Italian Minister for Foreign Affairs, in. response to the representations  of  the Russian Ambassador, has now consented  to  the  Russian Socialist  Delegates visiting- Italy. .                                         .      -     Sir E. Howard gives the report, of  a conversation which was  held with one  of  the Austrian Socialists when in Stockholm a short time ago.  He  is  informed that  the purport of  the  statement made by the  Austrian was that his country  could  not continue the war  for another winter,  and that the  workmen  in  the country would force peace  upon  the Government.   The  position in  Germany  wras  stated  to  be similar.
