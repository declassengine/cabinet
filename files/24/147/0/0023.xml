SECRET.231APPRECIATION  OF  THE  ATTACHED  WESTERN  AND  GENERAL                           REPORT,  No.  Do.                                   AUSTRALIA.   The result of the Referendum on  conscription is  the  outstanding feature  of  thisweek&apos;s  Imperial news.  For the second time within 1.-1-  months Mr. Hughes&apos; policy has been rejected by the Australian people ;  and on the assumption that the soldiers&apos;vote &quot;for&quot;  and  &quot;against&quot; will  be  sufficiently close  to  prevent  any  materialmodification  of  the:  existing results,  the&apos; substantial anti-conscription majorities in new  South  Wales,  Queensland,  and  other  States  show   that   the   influenceswhich operated against  the Government policy in 191(3 are even  more active  to-day.Amongst  these influences were undoubtedly the Labour hostility  to Mr. Hughes,fomented iu no small measure  by the prompt action taken during the recent strikes,and the. Irish opposition.  Two prominent personalities who threw their whole weightinto  the anti-conscription  campaign  were  Mr. Ryan, the Irish Catholic Premier ofQueensland, and Archbishop Mannix,  who until  comparatively recently was Rector ofMaynooth,  and is an Irish  Nationalist of the  most advanced  school of thought.Apart, however, from the  Irish-Labour  combination, powerful appeals were made to women voters, who were urged  not to  send men to  their death, and  to farmers andothers not to agree to the withdrawal of men from vital Australian industries, necessaryto the Allies, in  order to send  them  to fight  thousands of miles  away, when theunlimited  man-power of  America could  be much  more  easily and  expeditiouslytransported.   Though it is satisfactory to note Mr. RyaiTs statement that the decision  involves no weakening in Australia&apos;s determination  to play her  part  in  the  war, yet, as  thepresent Report shows, the situation created  is one of great difficulty for the Common-wealth Government.                                     FRANCE.   ddie issues  involved  in the prosecution of Monsieur Caillaux  are  of  such vitalsignificance that any failure on the part of the Government to bring home the seriouscharges that are made would, almost certainly involve the fall of Monsieur Clemenceau.ddie  imoceediugs that  have been  authorised by the Chamber  of  Deputies possess,therefore, an importance  which is not  confined merely to French internal politics, butaffects the relationship of France to the whole future course of the war.                                      ITALY.   The declaration of Signor Giolitti  in  the Chamber  of  Deputies that lie will neversupport a separate peace  or any action that is not absolutely loyal to the Allies, affordssatisfactory evidence of the solidarity brought  about  by the invasion of the &quot; patria.&quot;At the same time, the  growing power of the  attacks  upon  Baron Sonnino, and the
demands of the group of Giolittians and Clericals for greater Parliamentary control ofwar policy require careful watching, and when die Chamber meets again in Februaryno doubt renewed, attempts will be made to secure the  retirements of! thfcUTotfeignMinister.   Meantime, Signor Orlando seems to-.hayo accurately gauged the nature and extent of the support upon which he can at present rely ;  while  his frank recognitionof the necessity for greater  organisation in matters of food  supply is a satisfactoryfeature of his recent speech.

PART   I.   BRITISH  EMPIRE   AND   AFRICA.                             IMPERIAL  AFFAIRS.    The Dominion Governments  have been informed  that His  Majesty the  King has approved of the award of chevrons to denote service oversea undertaken since 4th August1914. Amongst those eligible are officers and soldiers of oversea forces, members  of oversea nursing services,  civilians attached tc British forces in an official capacity,Native Labour Corps and members of officially recognised Voluntary Aid Detachments.Additional chevrons will be given for each successive period of 12 months&apos;  service,which must be either oversea or within the sphere of active operations.  If earned on-or before 31st December 1914, the chevron will be red,  and if earned after that  dateit will  be blue, which will also  be the colour of  all additional chevrons after thefirst.    Owing to the necessity of allocating further British tonnage to meet the diminishingtonnage of I ranee and Italy and the comparative failure of harvests in those countries,the Dominion Governments have been informed that  it will  probably be necessary  tomake a considerable reduction of imports into the United Kingdom.                                    CANADA.    The President of the Privy Council (Mr. N.  W.  Rowell) will  be acting PrimeMinister of the Dominion during the fortnights vacation which Sir Robert Borden isnow taking.  ,    The Prime Minister (Sir Robert Borden)  in  the course  of a statement  regardingthe General Election, observes : &quot; The Union Government will have a majority of at&quot; least 50 in the new Parliament ; the result of the soldiers&apos;vote is not yet known,&quot; but it rnajr increase the majority to 60 or more.&quot;    The composition of the new House of Commons, apart from the five constituencies-for which the polls are  not yet  declared  and the  alterations which may result from-the returns of the soldiers&apos; votes, show that of the 138 supporters of Sir Robert Bordenjust over 100 will be his official  Conservative supporters, Avhilethe rest will be Liberalswho are  supporting the Union Government, and are therefore coming to he known asLiberal Unionists.   TVo  members who  have been included in  the returns for  the-Opposition  voted for  the Military  Service  Act  and will  probably vote  with  the-Government.  The  allocation of parties to  the Provinces are up to the present asfollows :                                                           Unionist.

    One half of the new members are men who did not sit in the last Parliament, andof the Opposition  only 43 members of  the  last House have been returned to  thepresent Parliament.      ,    AVith  reference to  the  position of Quebec, the President of the Privy Council,.(Mr. N. W. Rowell), has declared.: &quot; If Quebec really accepts the decision of the Canadian&quot; people  and co-operates in  carrying out the law  of compulsory military  service,&quot; national unity will be  re-established in Canada.&quot;   While omitting to discuss  theposition of Quebec under the  Military Service Act, the leader of the French Canadiannationalists (Mr. Bourassa) refers to the after war  problem of the relations betweenthe various parts of  the Empire.   He states : &quot; It will then be a struggle between&quot; Imperialism and  Nationalism,  and Nationalism wilL  come into its own.   In  the&quot; conflict  between Imperialism, and Nationalism, the place  of  French Canadians  is.&quot; made, no matter what  the politicians of any party  may do or want.&quot;  Mr. Bourassarefers to Canada&apos;s destiny as  one  of independence, but he says he would be preparedto accept an Empire  partnership,  although not such a partnership as the Imperialistsfavour.    Meantime it is  to be  noted that a  motion will be introduced in the QuebecLegislature next month to the following effect : -           &quot; That  this  House  is of opinion that the Province of Quebec would be       disposed to accept a rupture of the Federation,  pact of 1867 if in the opinion of       the other provinces it is believed that  the said province  is  an obstacle to the-       union,  and progress and development of Canada.&quot;    While the debate will disclose the opinions of Members of the Quebec Legislature,it is to be noted that the Leader of  the Opposition (M. Sauve) bas stated that he doesnot believe the motion is opportune or that it expresses the views  of Sir W. Laurierand Mr. Bourassa.    Though the defeat of the  French Canadian Ministers has deprived French Canadaof  representation in  the Union Cabinet, it is probable that  Sir Robert  Borden  willmake a further effort to secure  French Canadian representation in his Government..The  difficulties in this connection, however,  are by  no means  inconsiderable, as  atpresent there is only one French  Canadian Unionist  elected (Dr. Chabot) and he sits-for an Ontario constituency,  ddie three  supporters of the Government  elected for divisions of  Montreal, are  none of  them actually French Canadians.  Two of them (Mr.  Doherty and Mr. Ballantyne) are already Members of the  Government, and  the- third, Sir Herbert  Ames,  is  spoken of as a  probable addition to the Cabinet.   The lust-named has recently referred to  the possibility of Sir Wilfrid Laurier being invited &apos; to enter the Cabinet and has  declared that he is in a position to say that  there is  no chance of this happening.     With reference  to the  British  orders for shipbuilding in. Canadian yards (vide- Reports No. 4.-5 and  No.  46),   the British Government have informed the  Dominion Government  that they are anxious to utilise the  yards for the construction of  ocean- going vessels which  can be delivered daring  1919.   Meantime, it  is suggested  that steps should  be taken to prevent the foreign registration of vessels to be built in Canada during the Avar or during  a  period afterwards.  From  information supplied by  the Imperial Munitions  Board, the British Government understand that the total  steel tonnage  which coidd be used for the construction of  vessels might amount  to 4-00,000 tons.  In addition, 300,000 tons  dead-weight of wooden ocean-going vessels might, it is believed, be constructed.  If  orders  were given to the  extent indicated,  it  is  estimated that an  expenditure would  be involved of  -$150,000,000, commencing in  July  1918,  and  extending over  1.8  months   from  that  date.   ddie  expenditure  contemplates the  purchase of steel, and will thus  foster the  growth  of the  steel.  industry  in  the  Dominion.   It  is pointed out, however,  that  the United  States  Government have fixed the  price  of steel for  their own manufacturers at a  much  lower limit  than  Canadian  quotations,, and  it is suggested that,  in  order to avoid  jealousy between the steel   makers of  the  two  countries,  the price of Canadian  steel should be fixed at the same figure as that of the United  States.   In  order-  to give  Canadian companies the  necessary  inducement to develop the  industry, it  is  recognised that  lump-sum.  payments, or other recompense  distinct from  the-  price  of steel, may  be  necessary.  As  to financing the payments in Canada,  the  Dominion Ministers are reminded  that the British Government are unable to do  this  during the war,  and  they therefore ask whether the Dominion Government would-  appropriate  S 150,000,000 for expenditure on shipbuilding during the period mentioned
above.  It is pointed out that this would be in addition to the loan of $25,000,000monthly for other purposes,  ddie British Government would, in that case, undertaketo repay the sum within two years of  the conclusion of peace,  ddie hope  of theBritish Government is  expressed that  every effort will be made to undertake this financial responsibility owing to the vital importance of developing  the  shipbuildingresources of the Allies.   &apos; The  Union  Government have prohibited by  Order in Council  under  the  War,Measures  Act the importation of intoxicating liquor into Canada after 24th December,unless  it  is  purchased  before that  date and  imported  before  31st January  1918.The transport of liquor into the, eight provinces of Canada where  the  sale of  liquoris illegal  will  be prohibited after  1st April 1918.   due prohibition arrangements will remain  in force until  1.2 months after  the  conclusion  of peace.   It is  alsoannounced that the manufacture of intoxicating liquor within Canada will be prohibitedon a date to be determined after further investigation has been made into the conditionsof the industry.    In order to preserve  the financial  resources of  the country for the war issues.ofthe Dominion Government, an Order in Council has been made preventing  the issueof  bonds, stocks, debentures, or other securities  without  the approval in writing ofthe Minister of Finance.                        AUSTRALIAN  COMMONWEALTH&quot;.    The voting in. the  Conscription Referendum  stands at present  (exclusive of the votes of the soldiers serving oversea) as follows :                   Against     ....  1,072,000                  For    -        -         -         -   S89,000                           Majority against    -       -    183,000   (It is announced  that the voting of the soldiers up to the present shows 23,000 for,and 32,000 against.)   The above figures represent somewhat over two-thirds of the electors on. the roils,and though the numbers voting and the majorities in each State are not yet completelybrought up to date, the figures issued in this connection on 24th December are givenin the following table : For..   .  ,       Majority      Maiority 13             lor.        aeramst.New South WalesVictoriaQueenslandSoutli.

It has  been  pointed  out, however, that the  pledge given&quot; byMr. Hughes does  not necessarily bind  the National  Part)&apos;, and  the  Federal cabinet have decided to submit the question of the  action to be taken  to a  meeting of  theParty next week.  If the Leader  of the Opposition  (Mr. Tudor)  should be invited toform an Administration, it is possible  that a Dissolution might result, as the OfficialLabour Party   are faced  with  a  hostile, majority  of  over  30 in  the House  ofRepresentatives. On the other hand, the resignation of Mr. Hughes and the formationof a reconstructed. Ministry under him or under one of his present supporters, wouldprobably avoid  the necessity of a  General Election.   It is necessary, however, that parliament should meet again next month for the purpose of voting supply.    ddie Premier of Queensland (Mr. Ryan), who  has been one of  the  most prominentsupporters of the anti-conscription  movement, has declared, that  Australia^  rejection of the principle of conscription for military service beyond her own confines will not imply any lessening  of  her zeal  for the  honour and. safety of  the  Empire, or  any     4529-4                             15                   ...r
Gintention  in  the  future to relax the magnificent effort she has  made  since  the war--broke out to do her share in the great struggle.   In reply to the suggestion of the Army Council as to the raising of an AustralianRailway  Construction  Company  for  service  in  Egypt (vide  Report  No.  45),  theCommonwealth Government stated  (19th December) that  they could not approve theproposal, as it was necessary to conserve labour for essential industries in anticipation of the enforcement of conscription.   In view of the applications that have been  made  for ships to load copra and thatthe export from Australia  is prohibited except with  the  consent of the Minister ofTrade   and Customs,  the Commonwealth  Government have requested the BritishGovernment to furnish information  as  to  the  requirements of this article.  It is theintention of the Australian Government to refuse  all licences to import copra, exceptfrom the Islands in the Pacific which are under  British,  Allied  or  Commonwealthcontrol.   As  to the release  of further  coasting tonnage (vide Report No. 44), the PrimeMinister has informed the British  Government that it is not possible to release furthervessels  engaged in inter-State trade until provision is made to replace them by neutralor other tonnage.                               NEW  ZEALAND.   With regard to the recognition of the oversea troops who took part in the Gallipolioperations (vide  Reports No. 42  and No. 44-  under &quot;Australian Commonwealth&quot;),the Dominion Government have telegraphed that  they are of opinion the decorationshould,  be given to all Australian  and New  Zealand  troops who took part  in  the campaign and they have so informed the Commonwealth.   An  announcement has been circulated amongst the New Zealand  troops to  theeffect that the issue of  a special star and riband to members of  the 1914 contingentswho seiwed in Gallipoli has been  practically approved.  The decoration, it is  stated,will be  restricted to those who embarked on or before 31st December 1914, and whoserved  in the Gallipoli campaign by actually landing on the Peninsula.   The  Dominion  Government  report  that 11 prisoners of war  escaped   on31st December  from the  internment camp  on  the  Island in  Auckland  Harbour,including the &quot;Captain of the  Seeadler.  The prisoners  escaped in  a launch  andboarded  a small  trading. schooner, but they  have been  captured and.  returned to new Zealand.   During the course of  the year which is about  to close, the  Dominion parliament was  asked for authority to raise locally a second war  loan of 24,000,000-Z.   The first part of  this was oversubscribed by 4-,000,OOOZ.  (vide Report No. 33).  The interestingfeature  of the new loan  policy announced by the Minister  of Finance (Sir JosephWard)  was the introduction of tbe system  of  compulsory contributions.  Under  thisSir Joseph asked  the House for authority to  compel people  who  had.  not done their part in  providing the necessary finance for carrying on the war  to be assessed with additional heavy taxation.    Colonel Heaton Rhodes,  M.P.  (who was Postmaster-General in  Air.  Massey&apos;administration,  prior  to  the formation  of  the  National Government),  has beenappointed by the Dominion Branch of the Red Cross Society to go to England as a commissioner  to report  on Red Cross matters.   Fiis duties  will be to enquire fully into the  requirements and administration  of the London Committee,  with  special regard  to any  extension  of  operations and  to the desirability of creating  depots inFrance   or  Egypt.   He  is  further  to  report upon  the   methods of  dealing Avithdisabled soldiers, and the relations of philanthropic organisations to the Government,with a  view to the prevention of overlapping.    It  appears that  the  anticipated  contest  in  Wellington North (caused  by  the approaching appointment  of Mr. Herdman to  the Judicial Bench) will  not take place,as Colonel Hughes has withdrawn his candidature.  It is probable therefore that the mayor  of Wellington (Mr.  Luke) will be elected without opposition.                                 SOUTH AFRICA,   In response to tbe telegram from the British Government as to the most convenientdate for the next  sessions of the Imperial War Cabinet (vide Report  No. 45, under&quot; Imperial Affairs &quot;), the -Prime Minister (General  Botha) has telegraphed  that he is
..glad to accept the invitation to visit  England next year.  He states that the UnionGovernment intend to make the coining  Parliamentary Session  as  short  as possible,and directly the financial business is concluded he would be free to go  to England.He anticipates that he could not leave South Africa before the  end  of  March or  themiddle of April and that it might  possibly be a little later.    The  Governor-General has telegraphed  to  the  British  Government regardingrecruiting in South Africa for  the Air Service.  He points out that Major Miller, whohas been touring the country districts  and  has  already  accepted  600  candidates,telegraphed some weeks ago for a  fast machine to*  he  sent out and  for  permission to nominate the sons of naturalised British  subjects.   As he received no reply,  theGovernor-General  explains that  Major  Miller   could visit more  districts if  the machine were sent and that apart from the &quot;recruiting question TP is of  great  valuethat the power of the aeroplane should be known  throughout South. Africa.  YoungDutchmen, it is stated, are particularly  attracted  by flying, and. the fact that  eightNationalists have been already nominated, and that many more have applied to join, isgiven,  as evidence of  the  value of Major MilleFs tour.  As the sons of naturalisedBritish  subjects cannot   be  nominated, Major Miller  is prevented from acceptingsuitable candidates who are British subjects by birth (many  of whom have served inthe Avar) on the sole ground that before naturalisation their  fathers were the  subjects of allied, neutral or enemy countries.  As there is  a large element in South Africa offoreign origin which is  lo3ral to  the Crown, the Governor-General  submits  that  therestriction, which  is  causing  dissatisfaction  as well as the loss of  valuable recruits,should be removed.    ddie  Pretoria Committee  of  the  Netherlands Society  have offered the ButchGovernment 20,000 bags of maize for  the poor of Holland, and the Union Governmenthave  asked the British authorities if  they have  any objection to the export of thismaize, or to the export of  some further 6,000  tons which the Butch Government wishto purchase.                                   JAMAICA.   ddie Legislative Council have approved  of  the Government loans (to the extent of19,000Z.), granted to cultivators who suffered from the Jamaica hurricane in September.Idle Council have also voted  l,0O0L in aid of the relief of Halifax.
part  II. FOREIGN AFFAIRS.                              ALLIED  AFFAIRS.   Lord Bertie  reports that  the  French Government  is sending 3,000 tons of: coal aclay to Italy, to be increased to 5,000 as soon as railway facilities allow.   Lord Bertie  reports  that the French Government is unable  to  supply flour toItaly from stocks in France, and that the French Government itself is awaiting largeshipments of flour from England  for its own requirements.   Sir R. Rodd reports  that  the Italian Government contemplates requisitioning orlaying an embargo upon  cotton stocks which have been accumulated in Italy nominallyon account of Swiss owners, but probably  on behalf of German firms  for post-war purposes.   Sir  C. Dering requests authority to join with  other Allied  G oA-ernmeiits  in suggesting to the Siamese Government  that all  confiscated enemy property shouldbe pooled, and  set  against Allied  property confiscated, in Europe  by  the CentralPowers. -   Sir C. Spring  Rice reports  that the United. States Government  is sending as aChristmas  gift  to Norway, Sweden and Denmark respectively two  cargoes  each of3,000 to 4,500 tons of necessaries, as well as a quantity of  pharmaceutical products.In return the three countries have undertaken to  charter, for  an  equivalent time,.equivalent tonnage from  vessels lying idle in United States ports.   The Governments of Great  Britain, France,  and the United States are takingpreliminary steps with a  view to concerted action in regard to neutral banks.   ddie Ministry of Blockade has reported to the War Cabinet that  platinum, rubber and copper are likely to be imported by Germany from Russia in the near future, butnot food supplies on a large scale before April or May.  It is suggested that russia might be induced, under the, threat of receiving no  imports from Allied  countries, toagree not to export certain classes of supplies to the enemy.   ddie French and British Governments  have mutually agreed  to support the Radain every way  possible short of  official recognition, as tins offers  the only  hope ofeffectively assisting Rumania.  Subject to close liaison,  there will be two spheres ofAllied activity ;  Bessarabia, the Ukraine, and the  Crimea being supported, by France,.and  the Cossacks, Caucasus, Armenia,  Georgia  and. Kurdistan  by  Great Britain.Friendly unofficial relations  will be maintained  with the  Bolshevists,  with whom,however, the  French  and  British  Governments will break  sooner than  abandonRumania and the Ukraine.   Sir C. Spring Rice  learns that  as a  result of a recommendation of the UnitedStates  Ambassador at  Petrograd and of  a  statement by Dr. Ignatius that Finland,having  become  a Republic,  would  be unable to get any more  wheat from Russia,the United States Government has permitted Dr.  Ignatius to purchase J5,000 tons of oats and corn for shipment via Sweden,  ddie Swedes  are reported to have promisedfree transit.   ddie Swedish papers discuss the  question of recognition of Finnish independence.ddie Social Democrat opposes any recognition which is not endorsed by an establishedRussian Government.  On the other hand, activist papers are trying to force Swedishintervention  by  publishing long accounts of disorders in Finland, which they say it is-Swedehs  duty  to allay.   Sir E. Howard  learns  that  a Finnish delegation under mr.  Grifenberg  has waited upon  the President of  the Swedish Second Chamberand a Committee of Parliament, asking for Swedish assistance if  the Russians should refuse to evacuate Finland.   The President replied  that Sweden, would  not embark upon military operations in Finland, but  that  recognition might be considered if  theRussians offered no resistance.  The Finns propose to send  delegates  to Berlin,London, and Washington.  His Majesty&apos;s Government have intimated that  they will receive the Finnish delegates if they desire to  come to England.   The Foreign office has  already  instructed  the  Finnish  Government that  His  Majesty&apos;s  Governmentwould recognise the independence  of Finland if the Russian Constituent assembly should  do  so.   The Foreign Office lias  advised  Sir  E. Howard that His Majesty&apos;s.
 Government proposes  to  arrange  with  the  Swedish  delegates  for the  despatchof food to Finland, but  that it  is considered unwise at present  to  recognise Finnishindependence, as such  action might commit Great Britain to the recognition  of theindependence of Lithuania and Courland.    Sir E. Howard reports that a deputation of Aland islanders has been received byBaron Ramel, submitting a request for annexation  to Sweden,  ddie French  minister had previously advised  the Swedish  Government  to deprecate premature action, butthe terms of Baron RamePs reply are not known.    Mr. Grifenberg, a member of the  Finnish Cabinet, has declared, as a Sweden-FinUjthat the separation of  Aland,  from  Finland would  be a  serious loss  for  Swedishnationality in Finland, and. that such a separation  would be treated by the Finns as anunjust and unfriendly act.                                    FRANCE.    The resolution  asking for the  suspension of the Parliamentary  immunity  of Monsieur Caillaux was  passed in the Chamber  of Deputies  on 22nd December by 396 votes to 2.   There were 11.0 abstentions, amongst whom were 76 . Socialists and, 26 Radical  Socialists.  Monsieur  Caillaux  himself agreed  to  the suspension of his immunity, and Monsieur Refl.audel announced in the course of  the debate that if this had not been done the Socialist Party would have  opposed the suspension instead  of merely abstaining from,  voting,  ddie Chamber  also authorised by a  show of hands the prosecution of Monsieur Loustalot;  and the  Military Governor of Paris has signed the order  for proceedings to  be taken.   The charges against  Monsieur Caillaux, wdiich  were, brought,  before  the  Chamber by General Dubai!,  included those  of intimate connection with the  Bonnet Rouge, of co-operation  with Cavallini  in  con- nection  with  Bo!o&apos;s  dealings  with the  Central Powers  and  of  intrigues  during his  visit to Italy in  1.916.  ddie  last-named,  appear  to be  based  on the  Report of  the  Naval  Attache  to the  French   Embassy   at Rome,  in  the  course  of which  Monsieur  Caillaux  is  alleged  to have  stated  to  the  representative  of the Italian Prime Minister that he expected a Clemenceau-Barthou Ministry which could only live by intensifying  the war for two months, as  France would be unable  to continue her military effort beyond the end of the spring.  Monsieur Caillaux is said to have declared that he would then assume power and sign peace ; and he promised that the world, would be astonished at the advantages which Germany contemplated giving to Italy and France. He further stated, according to the Report, that Germany&apos;s desires in regard to the Baghdad line and. to making a greater Bulgaria and a great  European Turkey did not disturb France,  whose field of action was in Africa.   On the signing of peace, France, he asserted, would  conclude  a  treaty alliance with Germany and Spain  against England and Russia,  -who  were  her  real  enemies.   In his speech in  the  Chamber,  Monsieur Caillaux spoke  for two hours,  and  the  Figaro  admits that he  defended  himself with  remarkable  power.    He   reproached,  the  French. Ambassador  at   Rome  for  not  warning  him  regarding   any  dealings  with Cavallini;   he  declared  that  the  explanation  of    his   action  in  Italy  would show the   most  extraordinary  intrigue  ever  formulated   against  a  politician, that his connection with  the Bonnet Rouge was based, mainly  on the fact that the paper had defended him, that Bolo had come to him with excellent introductions, and that the association could not amount to more than imprudence on his part ;  and he announced that his policy excluded  any  agreement with Germany so  long as the question of Alsace-Lorraine had not been settled in accordance, with Ffench principles; While declaring his innocence and patriotism throughout, Monsieur Caillaux compared the launching of  the  case  against, him with the Affaire Dreyfus,  ddie Intelligence Bureau, in  dealing with the general question, reports that the  ultimate  issue is  onefar greater than the fate  of  an  individual.   If Monsieur Clemenceau has given way.to political and personal  prejudice, and has allowed the soldiers to prosecute MonsieurCaihaux on charges which they cannot sustain, he will fall, and there will be a dangerof the national spirit of France  being involved  in his  fall, and capitulating not toCaillaux in  person, but to the Extreme Left Party,  which  is  always suspicious ofthe Army, and  contains  many conspicuous  members who are decidedly hike-warmhbout  the   war and, like  Caillaux,  not  particularly  averse from a  deal  with theGermans.   4,529-&apos;!                               c
                                     ITALY.    At the sitting  of. the Chamber of Deputies, which  took place on 22nd December(when the House rose till  7th February),  the  Cabinet received the support of 345Deputies (including Signor Giolitti) as  against  an opposition of 50.   ddie minorityconsisted almost  entirely of  the  official Socialists.   A notable  contribution to the debate  was that of Signor Giolitti, who,  in replying to  the  observation of SignerPirolini that &quot; Caillaux was the Giolitti of France&quot;  stated that he would not acceptthe comparison &quot; for  the simple reason that I  have  never supported and never will&quot; support a separate, peace or any action which  is not absolutely loyal  to the Allies.&quot;He concluded, with an- appeal, to  Parliament to show a  united front  to the enemy&quot; within our territory &quot; ; and  the President of  the Chamber stated that the house would be deeply grateful to Signor Giolitti for  the appeal which he had made.  Inthe  course of  an earlier  statement made by the Prime  Minister (Signor Orlando)reference was made to the increased dependence of Italy  upon supplies from abroad.The Premier stated, that there  must be an increase  of production and  diminution  of consumption  combined with  better government, organisation  and discipline amongcitizens.   While announcing that the finances of Italy were in a  satisfactory position,Signor Orlando called attention to the  gravity of the  exchange problem which called for co-ordinated action.  He declared that the decisions of the Rapallo Conference had provided Italy with the assurance that the Allies would see that the country shouldnot fall short of the food, coal, or raw material  necessary for  the prosecution of thewar.    With regard to the demand of the Parliamentary Union, (which includes about one quarter of the Members of  the Chamber) for Parliamentary Commissions of control ofForeign and military policy, it appears from the Parliamentary correspondent of theGiolittian  Stampa (qxtoted  by the Intelligence  Bureau)  that  this  demand has been dropped on the advice of Signor Giolitti until the resvdts of the secret session shouldmake it clear whether satisfactory assurances could be obtained  for effective Parlia-mentary control of war policy.    At the Secret Sessions, violent attacks appear to have been made upon  BaronSonnino and General Cadorna.  In the  case of the former the  attack was led by theSocialist group and supported  by  Giolittians and Catholics.  The Intelligence Bureaureports that though  the Government seems to have presented, during  the SecretSessions a solid front to the  Opposition, it is  difficult to  believe that  this solidaritywill endure for long, as the  spirit  animating the Government is democratic and  anti-Imperialist and can hardly consist permanently with Baron Sonnino&apos;s  reactionary and anti-democratic opinions.    As to the possible retirement of Baron Sonnino  from the  Cabinet,  Sir R.  Rodd.remarks that after the recent Italian defeats such a course  on the part of  a politicianwho has the  main responsibility for Italy&apos;s  withdrawal from the  Triple Alliance and her association with the Allies  would be regarded  by them as of unfortunate  omen.While admitting  that  such a change  would at one  time have  been  disastrous, SirR. Rodd says that he would look on it now with sincere regret, but with less misgivingthan hitherto.    Sir R. Rodd reports the urgent desirability of  an increase in the  food and fuelsupply, especially at Milan, and of an.  increase  in  the allowances  to the wives and families of soldiers, in order to allay discontent at the  back of the Army.   Comparisonwith  the rations and pay of the Allied troops seems to be  accentuating the discontent among the soldiers.    Idle  Government  has  arranged for the issue  of free insurance policies to theamount of 500 or 1,000 lire  to soldiers or their  relations,   ddtese policies  can berealized at once on condition that the  proceeds are invested in land or  instruments of  production,  or realization  can be deferred  for a period  of  years  during  whichinterest will accumulate.  This  is a tribute to  the soldiers and also  a step towardsreconstruction after the Avar.    The Government  has also set up a  National Exchange Bureau, attached to theTreasury  but with independent  powers,  which is to  have a  monopoby of  foreign securities and to exercise control over imports.
                                   GREECE.   Representatives of the Jewish. Congress of Salonika, representing a community of&apos;80,000 Israelites, have  requested  General Milne to carry to  His Majesty their  con-gratulations on the liberation of Jerusalem, and their  thanks for the declaration ofHis Majesty&apos;s Government.   Lord Gran vide reports  that passports from  Switzerland  to  Greece can  only bevise  by  the  Greek  Minister at  Berne, wdio is being instructed to  keep in close touch wdth the British Minister in the performance of this duty.   In accordance with a decision of  the  Paris Conference, Joint Allied Commissionsare to be set  up in Athens to deal wdth the financing of  Greek military and  civilrequirements.   Lord Granville reports that all lignite mines in Greece have been placed under a-Commission  of  transport.   Commander  Martinet,  a  French  professional  miningengineer, is in  charge  of production.  He has applied to Paris for locomotives,  railsand trucks for the mine at Kymi, and Lord Granville hopes tbe despatch of these canbe expedited.   Lord Granville reports  that,  General Bracquet, Chief  of  the French military mission,  is being  recalled, and  that he will  be  replaced hy General  Bordeaux, whoserved  on the Western  Front  under  General  Guillaumet, the newly appointedCommanderdn-Chief at Salonika.   King  Alexander has  attended, two  demonstrations by Greek officers  and  non-nommissioned officers, who have been under training  by the French  Military Mission.His Majesty was most warmly received.   Lord Granville reports that French. Military Officers  are studying the question ofthe withdrawal southwards of men of military age from  Epirus in case of invasion.   The Press reports that the Greek Courts have ordered the confiscation of 5,000,000drachmae and 1,000,000  drachmae respectively from the estates  of M. Lambros andM. Skouloudis,  both of whom were Premiers under King Constantino.                                  PORTUGAL.   The Foreign Office has  instructed Sir I;. Carnegie  to co-operate with the AlliedMinisters in representing to the new Portuguese Cabinet the importance of an efficientcensorship.   Shortage  of  coal  is  having  a very  serious effect on railways,, factories  andillumination.                         ENEMY  ALLIED  AFFAIRS.   Mr.  Midler  reports on 22nd November - the failure of the Austrian harvest andfodder crop, and a general and increasing shortage  of food  on the Vienna market.Horseflesh  has reached a price calling  for official. intervention.  Butter  costs over15 kronen the kilog., both in Vienna and. Budapest. Apart from the scarcity of food theprovisioning of towns is complicated by the growing lack of transport facilities.-  A coalfamine is threatened.  Warm clothing and  thick footwear are practically unobtainable.Although Hungary has no  surplus of food, she is accused  by  Austria  of  disloyaltyin withholding supplies.   With  regard to Bohemia, the  medical professors of theGerman University of  Prague announce that.&quot; German Bohemia  is starving.&quot;   Thesuccess in Italy brought no real gratification to the Dual Monarchy.   In Austria it ivasregarded as a contribution only to German  advantage and a postponement of peace.Such enthusiasm as was shown in Hungary was due to the supposed nearer approach of peace.  A  well-known Austrian politician of non-German, nationality is reported tohave stated recently that the gold and silver reserve  at the Austro-Hungarian  Bankdid not amount in November 1917  to more than 13,000,OOOL, and that the greatestpessimism  prevails  amongst  Austrian financiers who know  that  Austria will befinancially lost after the war unless she can raise an enormous  foreign loan;   The Intelligence  Bureau comments on the meeting of the Austrian and HungarianDelegations as being the first since the Spring of 1914, and the first occasion on which
the Foreign Minister  could expound his foreign policy before the representatives ofthe two States, his  two predecessors in office during the war, Count Berchtold andBaron Burian, having acted entirely without popular  control.  Count Czernin after-explaining liow Austria-Iltingary had  been forced into the war, suggested that the-inclination  and  future interest  both  of  Albania  and Poland  gravitated towards.Austriaddungary.   Count  audit-army interpreted the phrase &quot; ho  annexations &quot; so asto allow of the inclusion  in the  Austrian  strategic frontier  of Mount Lovceii.   libadvocated the  unification of Serbia  and Montenegro with  a seaboard and with closepolitical find  economic relations with the Dual Monarchy.   Count Tisza, agreed inregard  to  the necessity of strategical rectifications, but objected to the survival  of aSerbia having access to the sea or of an independent Rumania. The report concludes&quot; that in Austfiadduhgaly as in Germany,  the  fonmila  of &apos; no annexations &apos;  is being&quot; interpreted liberally, and that there are serious designs ou foot for evolving a  new&quot; intermediary type  Of  state, neither  intermediate nor  vassal in  the sense hitherto-&quot; understood, but so linked with soihe stronger neighbours as to be forced  to revolve&quot; permanently in its orbit,  ddiis is the fate reserved for Serbia and Rumania by&quot; Austria-Id angary, for Lithuania and Courland and Belgium by Germany, for Poland&quot; by one or the other.&quot;    A Central News telegram  reports that  in the Austrian Reichsrat Herr Adler, aSocialist,  declared  that  the people  of Austria  could not  consent to making aseparate peace in the East, for the sake of making a separate war in the West.    By the new Hungarian Franchise  Reform  Bill,  which  is to be  introduced onFriday, the proportionate  number of   voters  according  to  nationalities (says   theFrankfurter Zeititvg) is as follows: Hungarians, 62&apos;6 percent.; Germans,  12&apos;5;,Slovaks, 9&apos;7;  Rumanians, 9*1 : and  other  nationalities, including Ruthenians,.Croats, and Serbians, 6&apos;1 per cent.   Sir Id.  Rumbold learns from  Vienna and Sir E. Howard  from  Berlin that  agreat German offensive  on the Western Front is imminent.  In Berlin it  is statedthat four  divisions have  recently been sent to the front,  and  that the  Germansintend to capture Calais,  and thus  obtain peace by March.  In  Vienna it is. saidthat 40 German divisions  are  being brought from the  Eastern Front, and  that oneof the  points  of concentration will be Maubeuge.  A new cyanide gas  is to beused,  against  which captured  French  and  Italian masks have  been shown to be ineffective.                        GERMAN  INTERNAL AFFAIRS.    Mr.  Muller reports that the German rations of  meat, bread,  and  potatoes are-inadequate.  The failure of the fodder crops is having far-reaching effects.  Milk is so-scarce that in some towns there is hardly enough for infants and  invalids, and inBerlin, children between one and two  years of age have to be content with d litre of milk a day.  Butter is described by a traveller as &quot;rare as blue  diamonds.&quot;  Barley-is less plentiful than the most pessimistic anticipated,  and there will, be less beer than ever.   The food situation, is further affected by the steady rise in prices due to growing-scarcity and to inflation of tbe currency.  Vorwarts  states  that  by the end of august the actual number of infants&apos; deaths registered in Berlin, since the  beginning of theyear exceeded by  6f percent, the number for. the  corresponding period of lastly ear,in spite of the fact that  the births during the same  period showed a decline of 10 percent.   Dysentery is prevalent in many districts, and hunger typhus all over Germany.The Seventh.  War  Loan of 625,00(),000L, while  showing  the  strength of Germandetermination and internal credit, may be partly  accounted for by the inflation of the currency,  and the  fact  that the funds invested  are  largely the  proceeds of the liquidation of the national wealth.  Further, war loans are  almost the only opportunityfor investing  liquid capital.   There is  a  serious  shortage  of coal,  of textile  andhardening materials, of sewing thread, and of leather.    Mr.  Muller further reports that the passage of the Bill for the Restoration of theGerman Mercantile Marine has been hailed with delight in German shipping circles.The measure, as finally passed, provides that for ships built  within four years after peabe-the Government will grant between  50 per  cent, and 70 per cent, of the differencebetween cost  of  building  at that time and  &quot; normal &quot; peace time Cost  of  building,.while for vessels  completed between five  and  nine  years after peace  the  grant is-between 20 per cent, and 50 per cent, of the difference.
   The Intelligence Bureau states that while there  is every reason to believe that thenecessity for an early peace daily becomes more urgent in Germany, it is impossibleto predict how far the morale of a people drilled and organised, like  the Germans will.be so reduced as by itself to lead them to demand, it.  From a military point of view,an elaborate German offensive in the West will mean vast losses, while  the  Italian.campaign also threatens to be very costly, and perhaps xuider winter conditions evendeadly.  Politically, Prussia,  which  represents two-thirds of Germany  in  territory and  population, and  more than two-thirds in military  power, wealth, and  politicalweight, is violently convulsed over the  Reform Bills, and  there is a possibility ofSocialist demonstrations (which could only be repressed with bloodshed) and also of sabotage and passive resistance  in munition works, on the railways, and  possibly atthe front.   The question of German finances after the war is causing the  gravest concern, andeven the Frankfurter Zeitung, the organ of the capitalist classes, is already advocatingthe immediate impounding of one-quarter to one-third  of war capital.   According to the German newspapers, the Independent Social  Democrats were,for the first time, invited with the other factions of  the Reichstag to  a conference withthe Imperial. Chancellor.   The German Wireless Press of 21st December states-that in the district  of  MinskGerman-Russian  business  has already begun. The Germans are exchanging metal goods for provisions.   ddie  German Wireless Press,  commenting  on the  suggested Allied  economic offensive after the war,  doubts whether  the  individual   Allied countries will  be eitherdesirous or able  to dispense with  the  German market.  &quot;For  instance, Italy could&quot; not long do without her best buyer for vegetables, fruits, flowers, silk spun  yarn, &amp;c,&quot; without seriously  prejudicing  herself.   Of course,  Germany is the  market  for&quot; Russian grain, flax, bran, wood, eggs  and many other products.  .  .   .   Not even&apos;&quot; France, if she wishes to bring her, industry back to  a  nourishing  condition after&quot; the war, can  for long do without those products wdiich are essential to her  industrial&quot; activity.  .   .   .   Further, many of  these countries  are in urgent need  of goods  with which,  only Germany can supply  them, such as coal, coke, potash,  sulphuric&quot; acid, ammonia, chemicals, dyes, machinery, and optical  and  electrical, apparatus.&quot;...  Moreover,  Germany is not so dependent to-day on  the worhhs markets as&quot; she was before the  war.   Her  industry by  the  preparation of  substitutes  has&quot; rendered  itself  independent of quite a  number of  foreign raw materials, only to&quot; mention the manufacture of synthetic rubber,   ddie  .use of aluminium in place of&quot; copper will also continue after the war.   .  .  .   The German textile  industry has&quot; during the war placed itself in an independent, position  by the utilization of nettle&quot;&quot; fibres and paper yarn.&quot;                                NETHERLANDS.   Sir W. Tbwnley learns that, subject to the satisfactory arrangement of credits for payment, 5,000 horses of five to eight, years of age are to be exported from Holland toGerm an y.                               SWITZERLAND.   Sir II.  Rumbold, reports  on  .12th December  the definite election  of  the  newCongress.  The present constitution of the Swiss National Council is as follows : Independent Democrats        -                     104Catholic Conservatives -         -         -      -42Social Democrats    -         -         -        -    18Liberal Conservatives  -         -         -      -    11Radicals   -        -         -         -              0independents         -         -         -      -     7Seat vacant         -         -         -        -     I   This on a division would give the Independent Democrats, or &quot; National Block &quot; amajority of  1.8.

                                    NORWAY.    Sir M. Findlay reports that the protraction  of negotiations  between the Allies  and Norway is causing considerable&apos; bitterness, and  suggests  the  advisability of a  settle- meut in London between a central Allied committee and delegates  from Norway.  He. emphasises the importance of assuring the duration, of any agreement so as to  secure Norway against the results of embittered relations with German)&apos;.    Discussions are  still in progress between the Foreign Office and the United States- Government with a view to agreement as to the Allied terms.    Articles have recently appeared in the Norwegian Press stating that  when  the exportation of coal from the United Kingdom to Norway was stopped last spring,  a German Swede, named Wilhelm Jansson, and  a Berlin editor, named Baake, visited Christiania and  offered to supply Norwegian ddades Unions with 40,000  tons of-German coke at the  price  paid  in Sweden  and  Denmark  on condition  that  the Norwegian Social Democratic Press should publish articles in favour of Germany  and that the Social Democrat Group in the Storting should procure the denunciation or modification of the fish agreement.   The articles state that this offer and a further subsequent one were refused by the Norwegians,  and contrast  the attitude of  the- Norwegian Socialists with that of the Danish Socialists, who allowed  themselves to be bribed with German fuel.                                    SWEDEN.    Sir -E.  Howard, reports  in  favour of  negotiating  a  commercial  agreement  withSweden on the following grounds : It is  doubtful whether  even the most rigorousblockade could, compel Sweden to  sever  commercial  relations  with Germany.  the probability is that Germany would  be able to supply Sweden with just sufficientnecessaries to render her immune to our pressure, which would only cause exasperationagainst the Allies  among  the  Swedish business  and commercial  classes.   This ex-asperation could not be cured by a  cessation of  the blockade  at a  later  stage, since-there is already in Sweden a lack of many prime necessities.   On the other hand, thenew Liberal  Government, which has everything to -gain politically by seen ring imports to Sweden,-is obviously making every effort to secure an agreement with Great Britain,and might be induced, by  the mere  argument of a potential blockade to fall  in  with british requirements.    Sir  E. Howard learns  that the Swedish  Government  has,  without  officiallyrecognising M. Vorowski, agreed to allow Swedish subjects  to procure Bolshevist visas;from him, and undertaken to  apply to him instead of to the  Consul for information regarding Russians passing through-Sweden, for Russia. .  He is  also  permitted to use-a cipher.    Swedish  papers announce  that the State Railway  Board  has been  authorised to-make an agreement for the delivery of 80,000-tons  of rails with  fish pieces by theStahlwerkserband A.G. in Germany, in equal instalments  over  1918, 19.19, and 1920,,half the total payment to be made in advance.sense, and the 11 or 12 French-Swiss deputies belonging to it sit very lightly to their part allegiance.   Hence, if they united with  all the Opposition parties, the NationalBlock would be placed in a minority for the first time for more than half a century.   Sir H. Rumbold adds that he learns that a considerable  amount.of anti-militaryfeeling was disclosed by  the elections.          &quot; This feeling is not confined to  the demagogues responsible for  the  recent       riots  at Zurich;  it is  spreading considerably among the middle-class  youths-       who furnish the &apos; conscientious objectors&apos; of our own country.&quot;   ddie  Foreign  Office advises Sir H. Rumbold of the desirability of-preparing  a.Statutory List of banks, institutions, or persons in Switzerland  wdio might transferfunds on enemy account  ; there is a special danger of the transfer to Switzerland and scandinavia of funds received in Spain from Central and Southern America.   ddie  British   and French  Ministers have been  instructed to  inform  the  Swiss-Government that transit of malt and  sugar to  Switzerland from  Holland throughGermany may be resumed.
                                  DENMARK.   Discussions between His Majesty&apos;s Government and the United States continue inregard to the proposed agreement with Denmark regarding supplies.   Referring to the anticipated qualified  blockade, the Intelligence Bureau observesthat  the Danish people  appear to agree  with the  statement of  M. Mowinckel.President  of the  Norwegian  Storthing, that if  the  choice lay between agreementwith America and. a breach  of  Scandinavian ties,  it  would  be  better  to  starvethan  to  separate.   The  Finans   Tidendc,  of   Copenhagen,   under   date   of28th November,  observes  that  in  spite  of  hindrances,  dangers   and  politicalthreats, Denmark allowed  to the Allies the  greater part of her  agricultural produce and  her shipping trade,  not  because of higher  prices-, but because she  wanted tocany on a  policy with a view  to the future.   Even if the  cutting off of supplies to neutral d^owers should at  present serve their purpose, it would in the long run causeirreparable damage  to  Great  Britain and  America.  &apos; Great Britain was confrontingDenmark with a crisis which gave her the option between suffering complete economicruin or seeking help where she could get  it.   By their way of  conducting the war,&apos;the Allies had up to the present only cleared the way for the supremacy of  Gnrmanyon the  European Continent.   The Danish Press of 12th.December says that  each weeksees the addition of fresh,  battalions to the  crowd, of the unemployed, and  that theyhad  increased during the preceding week by 20 per cent.   Sir  R.  Paget  advises the continuation of the  supply of  British coal  to loyalimporters.                                     SPAIN.   Sir A. Ilardinge reports that the Germans are likely at the forthcoming elections to finance carpet-bag candidates for a number of seats, including Algeciras, wdiich isat present represented by a friendly liberal-conservative.   He adds, however, that theMarquis  of  Alhucemas  has assured him that  he  will severely repress  any corruptinterference of this nature.    The Swedish Press also states  that the Government is considering the licence forexportation,  of between  10,000  and 15,000 horses, presumably- to Germany.   Sir E.Howard has deprecated  this as being prejudicial to  the present negotiations.  TheSwedish Government  in reply nas pointed ont that for lack of fodder- these horsescannot be  kept in Sweden.   Meanwhile scarcity of fodder is causing  a stoppage of timber transport and unemployment in the timber trade.    The Social Democrat has published a  manifesto protesting against the  suppression of  the Socialist Press in Russia and declaring  that the Bolshevists are betraying therevolution into the hands of Imperialism.    Sir E.  Howard learns that the Svenska Telegram Bureau, which has a monopoly ofReuter, Havas and American Creel telegrams, has been operating  from  the beginning-of the war as an agency of German propaganda.  As a result of American and Britishrepresentations, Reuters are prepared to  break  their  contracts with  the  SvenskaBureau, and strong representations are being  made in Paris that the Havas agency should clo the same.    The Social Democrat of 20th December  asks  why the  Swedish  Governmentcontinues to buy coal from Germany, vdien  it  could  have obtained  better  coal atequally favourable  rates from England.  Sir E. Howard, in a telegram to  the ForeignOffice, points out that  the cost of English coal  in Sweden is  only high because theSwedish Government, unlike the Danish, has not imposed maximum rates for freight.Meanwhile iron ore is being exported to Germany on the ground of Sweden&apos;s allegeddependence on Germany for coal.    Sir  E. Howard reported that about 1.8,000  tons  of transit  goods are lying in scandinavia, of which half are in Sweden and. the rest in Norway and Denmark.  he suggests that those in Norway and Denmark should be sold  there  or returned  to theUnited Kingdom and that those in Sweden should, be bought up  by a Swedish  agent onbehalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government.   He proposes that France and the United. states should take similar action in regard to French  and American goods in transit.
                                     JAPAN.   Sir C. Greene reports  that Japanese newspapers have been, forbidden  to publishanything in regard to the possible despatch of troops to Vladivostock or the meetingsof the foreign Advisory Council.   There  are  rumours that several transports  havebeen commandeered and. that the 12th Division is being mobilised.   Sir C. Spring Rice learns &quot;from  the United  States Foreign Office that Japan has a force ready in case the Japanese Colony in Viadivostock should be attacked, and thatthe United States Government is in treaty with the Chinese Authorities, who have alsotaken the necessary measures.  At the same time  the United  States Government isconcerned lest a landing by the Japanese may cause strong feeling in Russia and thusstrengthen Bolshevist influence,, and therefore deprecates the despatch of any Japaneseor even a Japanese-American force.                                     CHINA.   Sir J. Jordan learns from His Majesty&apos;s Consul at Harbin that Chinese troops are ready to occupy the railway buildings there if the Bolshevists should attempt to seizethem.   8,000  Kir in  troops  are  either in Harbin or  on their way there.  A. ChineseCommissioner, with a staff  of Russian  speaking Chinese, has proceeded to Harbin to administer the railway if  its occupation should become  necessary.  The Bolshevistshave, however, temporarily permitted General Horvat to remain  at  the head of theRailway Administration.  It is  estimated that less  than 2,000 local Russian troops are under  Bolshevist influence.   The  Japanese Minister has requested the ChineseGovernment to station troops at  various other parts on the Chinese Eastern Railway.   ddie deportation  of  enemy subjects  from China  is being recommended by  theAllies to the Chinese Government.   Sir J. Jordan reports that it is desirable  to arrange an agreement with the Chineseauthorities in  regard to the recruitment of coolies.   Sir J. Jordan suggests  that control of shipments from China might be best effectedif  the  Chinese  Government  would  supply the Allied Representatives  with  full particulars of  actual shipments by neutral vessels and of their ostensible destination.                                     SIAM.   The Foreign  Office advises Sir 11. Dering  that while  the  Siamese Governmentshould not be asked, to include Dutch possessions  in  trie  general embargo, he should suggest the  prohibition of - all exports  to Holland  and Scandinavia, except under licence approved  by himself.                                  ARGENTINA.   In view of the unsatisfactory attitude of&apos; the Argentine  Government in regard tothe Allied offer  for the purchase  of  wheat,  the  Foreign  Office has  instructed. SirR. Tower to point out  that in  the case of persistent refusal the terms of the offer willbe published  to  the  Argentine public,  and.  that British coal and  other exports will necessarily be diverted into other directions.                                    BRAZIL.   Sir A. Peel  reports that tbe Brazilian Government, desiring to supervise all banks,has proposed to establish a  bureau of statistics  of  the  dally operations of foreign exchange.   The Foreign -Office has  suggested that less objection would be taken byBritish Banks if the Brazilian Authorities would arrange  for  all returns to be madeto a Department of the Brazilian Government and to be treated as confidential.
                                       1-7                                  ECUADOR.   Mr. Wilson suggests the advisability of Great Britain purchasing a portion of the stocks of cocoa accumulated  in Ecuador, as such action would relieve the economiccrisis, strengthen the pro-Ally elements, and perhaps  result in Great Britain  takingthe place of Germany as the entrepot for cocoa after the war.                                    MEXICO.   Mr.  Cummins  reports that Mexico  City has  been reinforced, and  that  there  isconsiderable rebel activity in the country.  The German  Minister is trying to stir uptrouble, and would welcome the confusion caused by allied intervention.  Felix Diazshould no longer  be considered  a possible candidate, though he  would support anyEnglish nominee.   Sir C. Spring Rice agrees that intervention  is  undesirable  except  in  the lastemergency.   An American candidate  would  be  detested, by  the Mexicans,  and aBritish  candidate  would be  disagreeable to the United States.   A waiting  policy is best.  No reactionary party has any prospect of success.   Carranza, without supplies from  the  United  States, would be unable  to  take vigorous action, and the UnitedStates proposes to take advantage of  this  to  negotiate  for exportation  duty free ofallied  necessities.   Meanwhile the United  States  Government  sees  no reason,  torecommend  his recognition  by His Majesty&apos;s Government.   With regard to Cabrera,the United States Government believes  him  to  be intriguing with the Latin Americans,in concert  with the  President  of the Argentine  Republic,  against  Anglo-Saxonencroachment,   the  intrigue  being  . anti-American  or  pro-German  in character.Mr. Cummins reports that Carranza  has similar  ambitions, encouraged by german propaganda.  Mr. Cummins learns that, daily progress is being made with the wirelesstower  at  Chapultepac, which is  now  160 metres  high,  and  already  sending  toG ef many.                               UNITED  STATES.   Sir C. Spring Rice reports that the  War Trade Board  has formally notified itsassumption  of  the control of national, war materials,  such control  to  be exercisedthrough approved trade associations.  As there appear  to be no restrictions in regardto the  exportation of, e.g., articles manufactured of rubber and tin, he submits thatBritish control is still essential.  He adds that it is probable that import licences wdllbe granted to any firm appearing on British, approved lists.   ddie War Trade Board has announced that a condition of import licences for woolwill  be the right of  purchase by the Government within ten days  at a price to bedetermined  by  the  Valuation Committee  of  the Boston Wool  Association.   Sir C.Spring Rice considers that  this aims not  only at lowering the price of wool in  theUnited States, but also at breaking the South American  market.   Sir C. Spring Rice leaves  that  the S.S. Hellig Olaf and Bergensfiorcl full of peacepropagandists and Bolshevist agents, are proceeding from Scandinavia  to  New York.Suitable measures are to be taken on their arrival.                            SHIPPING SITUATION.   According to the War Trade Intelligence Report, the total  tonnage  of  500 tonsgross in the case of steamers and 100 tons gross in the case of sailing  ships  reported lost owing to the malice of the Ki.ng&apos;s enemies during the periods 7tli-13th december and Pith -20th December inclusive, respectively, are : -       7th-13th December      -  72,943 tons, of which 43,031 were British.       I4th-20th December     -  67,808 tons, of which 43,224 were British. ... The total tonnage lost in the preceding week, 30th November-6th December, was65,710, of which 37,71.8 tons were British.     4529-4                             t;
    The German Wireless Press communicates the following :---             &quot; The year&apos;s  balance  of  the  U-boat war, the increasing of which was          the German reply to the scornful rejection of the peace offer of 12th.December          1916&quot;, is sharply in contradiction  to the  original optimism of the. Entente          Governments.   Of  the  world tonnage  of  not   quite  50,000,000  gross          register tons, a good quarter has been,  sunk, of which, in ten months alone,          from 1st January to 31st October, 8,047,000 gross register tons were sunk,   if          the value of the ton  is calculated at  only 1,000 marks, it follows that there          has been a loss of 8,017,000,000  marks in that period.  To balance this,          the Entente lias had  at  its disposal  newly constructed ships, impressed          neutral cargo space, and. the  employment of German ships,  ddie German          supplies in  tbe hands of former neutral countries have  been exhausted, and          the  impressing  of  neutral  ships  can  no  longer  be increased  to any          extent  worth mentioning.   ddie capacity  of  new constructions  amounts          yearly to between 2&apos;5 and (at the most) 4  million tons.&quot;     The foreign Office  informs Sir E. Howard that the Swedish Government  has  set  out an offer of  terms on which it will  permit  the chartering  of  Swedish  tonnage by  tbe Allies.  Before concessions  are granted  in. return by the Allies, Swedish  ship-  owners are. being  approached  in  order that their readiness to sign charters may be  ascertained.     Sir M. Findlay learns that negotiations are in progress between the United States  Government and  the Norwegian Government under which, in return for the supply  by the  United   States of  shipbuilding material, a percentage of vessels  constructed  therewith will  be placed at the disposal of America.     The War  Trade  Intelligence Bureau  states  that  the American  proposals  for. a  shipping agreement with Denmark involve? :      (a)  The allocation of 350,000 tons  dead  weight to Danish  overseas trade ;     (/))  ddie allocation of 300,000 tons  dead weight to-the United States; and     (c) The division of the surplus  between  Great Britain and the United States.     A satisfactory principle for  the division of the surplus has  still to be arranged.  His Majesty&apos;s Government is pressing for a quota  of not less than 200,000 tons, this  being the  quantity  of tonnage which  the Danes  are  bound,  by their shipping&apos;  agreement  with  Great  Britain,  to  maintain,  in   the  Anglo-French  coal  trade.  Sir it. Paget learns that the German Government is  more concerned over  the tonnage  question than over the restriction of Danish imports into Germany.     ddie War Trade Intelligence Bureau reports that there are 60 enemy vessels lying in  Spanish waters.   The Spanish Government has authorised  two Spanish  subjects  to  charter them from the owners, on condition that  they trade under the Spanish flag  and do not  trade with British Possessions.  It is understood that if this arrangement  takes  effect, the  Italian  Government -will obtain  the use  of the vessels.   But an  American syndicate is competing for the charters and still, hopes to obtain them.    -ddie Foreign. Office  has instructed  Sir G. Spring Rice to  consult with the United  States Government with a view to obtaining, through some influential firm, the services  of enemy tonnage in  the Argentine, Chile, Colombia, and Bern, and also to  approaching.  the Brazilian Government in regard to vessels not bought by the French Government.     The Foreign.  Office advises Lord Grauville  that  the inefficient employment  of  certain Greek passenger ships is inexcusable.   His IVIajesfy&apos;s - Government would  be  prepared to assist in the insurance of  these.ships on condition that they were . trans-  ferred at rates of valuation to be agreed-     The Foreign Office, witli the consent of  the French Government, has arranged that  the United  States and His Majestyh Government shall lie responsible for all negotiations  at Montevideo  in regard, to enemy  ships interned in. Uruguayan ports.     Sir O. Spring Rice reports that&apos;the United  States Government is  exercising, like  His Majesty&apos;s Government, a stringent control over all ships&apos; stores taken  on board by  neutral vessels.     Sir 1.1. Dering reports that British firms in  Siam  have represented  that the with-  drawal of further tonnage is likely to ruin local British  trade and  other industries&apos;  Avhich  it was desired to encourage at  the expense of the enemy.     Sir C.  Spring Rice reports that  Mr. and  Mrs. Robert  Barrett have been coin-  missioned  by the United  States Shipping  Board to  proceed to England in  order to  study the  handling  of the labour question in  shipyards.   They propose to discuss  matters with Government authorities, masters,  and  union and non-union  men.  They
                                   .19                                        gare specially interested in the handling of unorganised labour, and in the methods ofco-ordination between  the Admiralty,  the Merchant Marine,  the  Army, and  theMinistry of  Labour.  It is hoped that the information gained  from their visit mayhave a decisive effect upon the Shipping BoarcVs programme of construction.                            PEACE  DISCUSSIONS.    A telegram from Brest-Li tovsk, dated 25th  December,  and received via Vienna,says :     At  the  plenary  sitting  held  to-day Count czernin,  who  presided,  made thefollowing statement in the name of the delegates of the Central Powers :     ddie  delegations  of  the  Quadruple Alliance  are ill accord with an immediategeneral peace, without forcible acquisitions of territory and without war indemnities.    When the  Russian  delegation condemns  a war prosecuted  only for purposesof conquest the delegations of the Allies are in accord with its Adew.    ddie statesmen  of the  Allied Governments in their programmes have repeatedlyemphasised,  that  the Allies  would  not prolong  the war a  day  in order  to makeconquests.  The Governments  of  the Allies have,  without deviation, adhered to thisstandpoint.    They solemnly declare  their  determination  to sign without delay a peace that willend this  war on  the foregoing basis without exception,  and  with the  same  justconditions for all tbe belligerent PoAvers.    It must,  liOAvever, be  expressly pointed out  that all the PoAvers now participating in the Avar must within a suitable period, without exception and  without any reserve,bind themselves to the most  precise adherence to conditions binding all nations in thesame manner if the suppositions of the Russian expose are to be  fulfilled, for it wouldnot do for the Powers of the  Quadruple Alliance, negotiating with Russia one-sidedly,to tie themsehres to these conditions  without  a gaiaraiit.ee that Russia&apos;s Allies willrecognise and  will carry  out these conditions  honestly and  without reserve also  asregards the  Quadruple Alliance.    ddiis having been stated  beforehand,  the  following  observations must be made regarding the six points&apos; which are proposed by the Russian delegation as a basis for negotiations :     1. It  is not the intention, of  the Allied  Governments  to  appropriate  forciblyterritories which are at  present  occupied,  ddie question of  the troops in occupied territories must be settled  in  the sense  of the withdrawal of troops from such andsuch places.   2. It is not the  intention of the Allies to rob of its independence any of the nationsAvhich in the course of this Avar have lost their  political independence.    3. ddie question of the  State allegiance of national groups which possess no  Stateindependence  cannot, in  the opinion  of  the  Quadruple Alliance,  be regulated asbetween States, but  is,  if required,  to be solved by every  State  with  its peoplesindependently in a constitutional manner.    d. likewise, according to the  declarations of the statesmen  of the QuadrupleAlliance, protection- of the right  of minorities forms an essential component part of theconstitutional right of peoples to self-determination.    ddie Allied Governments also grant validity to this principle  everywhere in so faras it is practically  realisable.    5. The Allied powers  have  frequently  emphasised the possibility that -not  onlycould both sides renounce  indemnification for  Avar  costs,  but  also  indemnification&apos;forAvar damage.    Accordingly eveiy belligerent Power would only have to idenmify for the expendi-ture for its nationals who have become  prisoners of war, as Avell as for damage donein their own territory by illegal acts of force committed  against  civilian  nationalsbelonging to the enemy.    The Russian Governments proposal for the creation of-a special  fund for thispurpose  could only  be  taken into consideration  if  other belligerent  Powers  AvereAvithin a suitable period to join in the peace negotiations.
    6. Regarding this point, Germany is the only one of the four Allied  Powers thatdisposes of overseas colonies.  On  this subject the German delegation, in completeaccord wdth the Russian proposals, adds that           The return of Colonial territory forcibly captured and. occupied, during the       war is an, essential component part  of  the  German demands, which  under  no       circumstances can be departed from.          In the same way tbe Russian demand for the evacuation of such territories       occupied by the enemy corresponds wdth Germany&apos;s intentions.    ddie following are the six main points  of  the  Russian  peace proposals : (i) Noterritory conquered during the  war  to be retained  by force,  (ii)  Complete inde-pendence to be restored to all peoples who have lost it during the war.   (iii) Peoplesnot independent to have the right to decide their  future  by referendum,  (by) in territories  occupied by  more  than one nationality,  the minority to be guaranteedindependent national culture and, where possible,  independent administration, (v) no military contributions to be  paid contributions already  exacted, to be returned ;damage  to private property  to  be  made good  by  all  combatants in proportion.(vi) colonial questions to be decided on principles laid down in (i) and (iv).    A Renter telegram from  Petrograd dated 26th December, states :           With regard to the  German reply on. the  third of the points laid down by       the  Russian delegation as  the  basis  for peace  negotiations,   the  Russian       delegation pointed out  that the Cferman reply contained a reservation.          &quot;The abolition of annexation,&quot;  the Russian delegation proceeded, &quot;is the       &quot; logical consequence of the general principle of the right of peoples to regulate       &quot; their own destinies.    This  right is  recognised in  existing  constitutions       &quot; only in a small degree, and, consequently, to speak of constitutional channels       &quot; as the sure means to  achieve this  right is to nullify this principle.  It must       &quot; be said that the four- Allied Powers, while  they agree  not  to apply the. right       &quot; of  the strongest in  territories occupied during the  war, nevertheless  do       &quot; nothing for small nationalities in. their own  territory,  ddie war cannot come       &quot; to an  end without the  restoration of independence to small   nationalities.       &quot; The Russian delegation, as formerly, insists on the rights  of  these nations       &quot; being protected in  the peace treaty.  Historical prescription does not justify       &quot; one people being subservient to another.&quot;    Sir C. Spring Rice learns that the German Government will, shortly make an offer of peace, the terms of which have been communicated to the Netherlands  Government.    With regard to the Armistice  Agreement between  Russia and Germany the Jntel-Intelligence Bureau points out the following :           (1) Article IV: Arrangements  &quot;for the development and strengthening of       friendly relations between the nations of the contracting parties &quot; will doubtless       allow of  propaganda among  the  unsuspecting Russian peasantry  by carefully       chosen German emissaries at the front.          (2) Article VII. It will  lie  noted that  one of the places where special       commissions, presumably half  German, are to  be established in order to give       effect to the agreement, is Odessa, the great centre of the wheat trade.          (3) Article IX. ddie agreement regarding  Persia is a direct interference       with existing engagements between the Russian and British Governments, and       is-a first step towards placing Russian foreign policy in German leading strings       and directing it against British interests.   Generally the armistice terms bear       every sign  of being an essentially German production aimed  at  obtaining       German, control over the population  and resources of Russia.    Sir G. Buchanan learns  that  the Bolshevist Torch, newspaper, printed in German,was sent in  large numbers  to the  front  on  19th  December,   ddie paper aims  atbringing about &quot; spiritual  contact between  the Russian Revolution  and.  Germansoldier  brothers.&quot;  A. Press  report states that  the  consignment was  destroyed   on arrival.  A Hungarian edition is being prepared.    The Pravcla points out that the clause  in the armistice precluding the transfer ofGerman troops to the Western Front ceases to operate on the 14th January, which isthe date within which the Allies must join in.  negotiations for the  general cessation of the war, and adds &quot;we advise them to hurry.&quot;    ddie following passages are extracted from a written statement by Ihotzky :             &quot;Revolution broke  out first in Russia  only  for the  reason  that the         machinery of government  was weaker  in  Russia than in  other  countries.         But the  Avar has  in all countries caused an accumulation  of   reAmlutionary
          yearnings in the very depths  of mankind,  and revolution  will break out          earlier than  is  expected  by the ruling  parties of  Europe.  The plan, of our.          universal policy is to give a push  to the revolution in the centre and on the          west of Europe.   This is the real road to a democratic peace.&quot;             &quot;We  are convinced  that the German peoples, who are now shedding          their own blood,  will  not allow the German ruling-class  officers to attack          revolutionary -Russia.  We  are  sure there will be a  temporary peace on all          fronts.   But if (though  we find it impossible to  imagine this),.against our          straight  and open proposition  of immediate democratic peace,  the German.          people remain passive ,and the  German  Kaiser moves his armies against us,          our army will defend itself to the last drop of blood, because it is not now a          question  of  an  imperialistic  war, but  it is a question  of guarding  the          revolution, which offers peace to everybody.&quot;    ddie  Intelligence  Bureau&apos;  estimates  that there seems  to  be  small  foundation for  the  hope of the  Bolshevists that they  can   hold.   weapon over Germany in the  form of political  agitation.  Any action which the German Majority Socialists may  take in  the  direction of peace  is  unlikely to be&apos; founded - on the  methods  of the  Bolshevists, whom they despise as  inferior  to themselves both, in culture  and patriotism.  The Press, encouraged by  the present military position, has  recovered from the depression caused  by the American revelations  of  German diplomacy in the United States, Mexico, and the  Argentine,  and  paints in  golden  colours  the nobility  of the Reichstag Resolution :of the 19th July as  contrasted  with  the annexa- i ion:st   greed  of  the  Allies  as   disclosed  by  the   Petrograd archives.   In.  the exploitation of  these disclosures  as a  means to  influence neutral  and  American opinion, no mention is made of the fact that the Resolution in question has since  been. largely repudiated or of the aggressive speech  of Count Czernin  to the Hungarian delegation on the 6th December threatening Italy that, if she means to fight, she must not hope for a status quo ante helium.   With regard to the past, Bethmann-Hollweg&apos;s declarations to Mr. Gerard  about Germany&apos;s intentions with respect to  Belgium are brushed aside as apochryphai.    Sir H. Rumbold learns  on reliable authority that Baron von Kuhlmann  denied in conversation the necessity of Germany declaring her terms of peace even in regard to Belgium.  Apparently General Ludendorff genuinely desires peace, but is opposed by the Junkers and industrial magnates, who insist on certain  annexations, particularly the  Mr icy basin.   Though  economic pressure  is relieved by the Italian and Russian positions, many members of the Reichstag  majority  seem  prepared to accept terms approximating to those proposed in the Resolution of last July.   ddie Russian wireless  from Zarskoje Selo makes known  the following concerning the negotiations for an armistice : -          &quot;The responsibility for the  separate  character  of  peace must  be borne       entirely by those Governments wdiich until,  now have refused to  make  known       their conditions for an. armistice and  for peace  and which  continue to conceal       their aims from their own. and from,  foreign peoples and  in whose names the       war is  to  be carried on  further,   ddie  destiny of the  nations must  only lie       decided, fry the free will of these peoples  themselves.  All.  peoples who   feel       themselves  oppressed must be able.to express themselves freely concerning       their further fate.   The districts  which have  suffered  especially hard under       the miseries of  war must be indemnified out of  an international fund which, is       to be formed by a levy on the capitalist classes  of all belligerent countries, for       all  the responsibility  for  the war  rests  upon  the capitalist classes. . An       honourable democratic  peace can  only lie  realised by a  decisive and resolute       struggle  of the  working  classes of all  countries  against their respective       imperialists and  annexationists.   ddie working  class  in lands  allied  with       Russia  is called upon to secure with their whole force their, participation in the       peace negotiations,   d?he  Council  of  the  People&apos;s Commissioners feels itself       bound by none  of the old treaties in wdiich are set forth, the predatory exactions       of the capitalist classes.&quot;   It  also  urges  &quot;comrade radiotelegrapbists throughout Russia  to  unite for  thepurpose  of propagating cultural enlightenment in  all corners of the country.&quot;   Sir G. Buchanan reports that the Commander-in-Chief has  declined to disclose tothe Germans the Russian mine-fields in any part of  the Baltic before peace is signed,and adds that  it now appears that shipping of either nationality  will not be able underthe armistice to have access to both countries.
   The Secretary of International Affairs  of the  Ukraine has  declared  to  all allied representatives that the Ukraine has constituted itself  an independent Republic alliedto the countries which are at war with the Central Powers.   Sir E. Howard  reports that IVl. Scheidemann  has taken rooms in Stockholm, andthat M. Wehltner, the Hungarian Socialist, has arrived in that city.   Sir E. Howard,  learns that M.  Scheidemann has brought a Resolution passed  by120,000  Hungarian Socialists  demanding not a separate  peace with. Russia,  but ageneral and permanent peace which guarantees democratic  development.  It appearsthat the Hungarian Socialist Party is doing  everything possible to obtain a plaindeclaration by the Central Governments of their war aims.  M. Weldtner has broughta similar message from M. Haase, of the German Socialist Minority, and  intimates thedesirabilitjr of a similar declaration by the Allies.                                   GENERAL.    Lord Newton reports that an agreement has been reached by the Berne Conference&apos;upon the following points : (i) Immediate exchange of 1,000 British and  1,500 Turkishinvalid combatants ; (ii) exchange of  civilians who wish to be  repatriated, excluding(with two exceptions) those  of military age ; (iii) inspection, when desired,  by DutchLegation of all camps situated west and north of Taurus,  ddie Turkish government also undertakes to withdraw between 2,000 and 3,000 men from camps beyond Taurus ;(iv)  adoption of lowest standard of disability in the case of combatants,  who are to be examined by two Tnrkish and one British prisoner doctor; (v)- transfer to be effected by sea  between Egypt and  a Turkish port;  (vi) other  subjects of agreement  follow the lines of the Hague Agreement.    ddie Foreign Office learns from the Swiss Post Office that a  loss  is  caused  to  the swiss Administration by &quot;dealing  with  the  correspondence  of  prisoners of  war,  andthat the Administration, therefore, proposes to claim as from the beginning of nextyear a credit of 25 centimes in respect of every parcel forwarded from Great Britain,France, or Italy to Switzerland for transmission to  British,  French or Italian prisonersof war in enemy countries.    The Foreign Office  informs Sir W. Townley that His  Majesty&apos;s Government isprepared to conclude  an agreement  with Austria-Hungary for  the internment  in holland of invalid civilians interned or uniuterned in  either country.  This agreement would not be applicable to men over  45  who are  eligible for repatriation as beingunfit for military service.
