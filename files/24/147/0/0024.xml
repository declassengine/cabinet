SECRET.-  APPRECIATION  OP  THE  ATTACHED &apos;-WESTERN  AND  GENERAL&apos;        I:                      REPORT,  NO,  PJ.     -     ;                 AUSTRALIAN  COMMONWEALTH.   The meetings that, are being held  by the National Party and the official  LabourParty on the 3rd January will be of  considerable importance, and the results mayexercise a powerful  influence not only upon the internal  politics, but  also  upon thewar  policy of the Commonwealth.  While  it is  fairly certain that Mr. Hughes  will consider it  his  duty to place his resignation before his Party, as a  result of the referendum  defeat,  yet it seems  hardly possible, having regard to the substantialmajorities supporting the Government in both Houses of Parliament, that an admini-Stration of any stability could be formed  outside the ranks of the National Party.                                  NEWFOUNDLAND.   Idle retirement of Sir Edward Morris from  the Premiership and from Parliamentremoves from public life,  it is hoped only temporarily, a member  of the Imperial WarCabinet who took part in the proceedings of the last  Sessions.   As will be  seen fromthis  Report, the action taken by Sir E. Morris has been dictated  mainly by  the desireto promote party unity at the coming General Election.  It is interesting to note thatthe conscription issue has played a  substantial  part in. the matter, and.  is  thusinfluencing the state of parties in Newfoundland,  as it has already done  in Canada and.Australia.                                      ITALY.   The  forthcoming visit, of Signor  Nitti to  this country is  of  interest,  and -his attitude towards Baron Sonnino is worth noting.   ddie  question of  coal supply continues to exercise an important influence upon thepublic attitude to the war, and it  is satisfactory to know  that the matter is engagingthe attention of the Shipping Controller.                                PEACE  DISCUSSIONS,   Interest centres in the nominal  acceptance  by Count Czernin,  on  behalf of theCentral  Powers,  of  the  Bolshevist catchphrase &quot;no annexations,&quot; and its influenceupon the internal  situation in belligerent  countries.   The failure by the  CentralPowers  to   apply it literally  to  Lithuania at the  Brest Conference proves theirinsincerity, and is likely to reduce that influence.   This, and other causes, has alreadybrought about a hitch in  the Russian negotiations for peace.    Trotsky&apos;s violent appeal,  received  through  Russian Wireless, has the appearance of an attempt to instigate revolutions against all constituted authorities,   ddie  Germandeputations  at  Petrograd find him  in a weaker  position than  they   imagined, andinefficiently  supported by subordinates in the task of Government.
   As a result of the influence  of  peace discussions  on the internal situation inGermany, there are signs of the need for an immediate military success  to strengthen the dominance of  the  military authorities over the country.  Among these  signs aredissatisfaction  at  the  system of  food  distribution, explosions in munition factoriescombined with industrial  unrest, anxiety on the part of the authorities to contradictreports  of  the  suppression of  Minority Socialists,  and failure  by the  militaryauthorities to stop tbe  spread of Bolshevist propaganda in the German language.   In Russia,  the  arrival from  Germany of  commodities  to  meet  urgent  needs  isinfluencing some of the population to  favour immediate peace,   There is no mention of foodstuffs amongst these commodities.   In France, and, less  openly,  in Italy, there  are  indications that some of theSocialists have been  influenced  by the  &quot;no annexations&quot;  phrase, and there is ademand  for further definite statements  of war aims by the Entente Alliance.   ddie State  Department announce that the  intentions  of  the United States have notbeen changed, and that they will not deal with the Kaiser (Press Gable).   The  indication that certain forces  in Bulgaria are working lor an understanding with the Entente Powers is worthy of notice.   ddie  speech by Dr. Solf  on tbe application  of  the self-determination policy  tonatives of Africa  is  worthy of special attention,  especially the plea against their&quot;militarisation.&quot;3rd January 1918.G; G.

PART   I.-BRITISH  EMPIRE  AND  AFRICA.                             IMPERIAL AFFAIRS.   The Governments of the  Dominion, of Canada and the Union of South Africahave  been informed  that owing to the failure  of  the  cereal harvests in France andItaly, which lias made it necessary to allocate stocks  to those countries which wpuIdotherwise have been  utilised,  by the United Kingdom, it  lias  become necessary toincrease the shipments of cereals from. North America.  As the tonnage-available ismuch  less than, that  which  is  necessary, ships of the Elder  Dempster  Line,  nowsailing between Canada and South Africa, are being diverted for service between  ports in the United. Kingdom and those of the United  States and Canada,  ddie hope of  theBritish Government is expressed that the Ministers of the respective Dominions will-agree with the course that is being taken.   ddie Dominion Governments have  been informed that the British Government havedecided, not to  license any-exports to  Russia, except small quantities of clothing, andthat it is hoped that the Dominions will adopt a  similar  course of action, and will alsoprevent goods hitherto licensed for export to  Japan from being re-exported, to Russia..                                    CANADA.   With reference to  a telegram from  the British Government  as to the most eon-yenient date for the next Sessions of  the Imperial War Cabinet (vide  Report No. 45,under &quot;Imperial Affairs &quot;), the  Prime Minister (Sir Robert Borden) has telegraphed that it would be practically impossible for him to come to  England for the purposeuntil  the end  of  the approaching Session of  Parliament,  which  will be  about  themiddle of May or  the  beginning of dune next.   Regarding the soldiers&apos; vote in the recent General Election, the figures show that 105,000 men voted in England and  133,000 in France,  ddiough  the precise details--as to.the voting  for and against the Government will not be known till February, it is estimated that a large majority  of the votes were cast in  favour of the Union-Government.   It  is interesting to note that the coalition  of  Conservatives and Liberals which hastaken  place in. regard to Federal politics is likely to  exercise  an important influence upon the politics of the Provinces.  Many of the most prominent Canadian newspapers.are advocating new &quot;party alignments throughout the Provinces, and questioning theright  of the &quot; self-styled Liberal Parry at Ottawa  to follow Sir W. Laurier.&quot;  These newspapers argue that  the best element of the  old Liberal Party is  now supporting the  Union Government, which  will soon  be  composed of equal numbers of Liberals-and  Conservatives,  ddie  papers in the West are strongly supporting  the  suggestion of the alteration of Party allegiances in  the Provinces  ; and  many indicate that  thenext Provincial elections will  be fought on the new lines.    It  is announced  that 20,000 men, who  have been already  passed lit for service-overseas, will report  for duty under the Military  Service Act on 3rd January (vide Report No. 45).  ddiese men  will be composed of those  who volunteered for service when  the original call was made, or  who have since  been refused exemption  by the&quot;Tribunals.    ddie Union Government have decided to take strong  measures regarding absentees,-and have passed an Order in.  Council providing for the payment of the  reward of 10 dollars to a police officer who delivers into  military custody any person who fails to report under the Military Service Act.    Owing to the importance  of providing tonnage for the transport of the United States troops to Europe, the  British  Government have asked the Dominion Govern-ment to release  two vessels, registered in Canada, now engaged in the Pacific  trade,and  to requisition  them  on  behalf of  the British Government for the purposeindicated.    With  regard to the prohibition  of  the  importation  of intoxicating liquor  (vide report No. 48), the Premiers  of Saskatchewan,  Alberta, Manitoba,  Ontario and PrinceEd war d&apos;s Island have issued statements approving of  the  legislation.  The Premier--of Ontario (Sir W. Hearst)  says:  &quot; The action of  the  Dominion Government  will
undoubtedly add greatly to the financial  strength and  lighting powers generally  ofthe nation.&quot;    ddie Imperial Munitions Board  have estimated  for the coining year a minimumexpenditure of  $360,000,000 in the  Dominion.   ddie outlay is on  the basis  of830,000,000 per month, $25,000,000 being furnished by the Dominion Governmentin respect of Imperial credits, and  the  remainder coming from the United States  inregard  to  material  purchased in that country for the. manufacture of munitions  inCanada.  One hundred thousand 4&apos;5-inch shells and a similar  quantity of  18-pdr.shrapnel are now being turned out  monthly.    ddie Minister.of Marine,  Fisheries  and Naval Service (Mr. C. C. Ballantyne)  is engaged in working out the details of  a scheme for the establishment of a Govern-meet shipbuilding plant, in anticipation of being in a position to submit proposals for legislation on  the subject to the next Session of Parliament.                               NEWFOUNDLAND.    Sir Edward  Morris  has resigned his office of Prime Minister of Newfoundland andhas announced to his constituents that  he will not offer himself for re-election at theforthcoming General Election,  ddie decision which  Sir Edward Morris has taken hasbeen  arrived at  in order to promote unity amongst  the parties.   At  the  last  GeneralElection in 1913 Sir Edward  Morris, as Leader of the Conservative or People&apos;s Party,defeated the combination of  Liberals and FishermeiTs Union Parties, the latter  being-practically the Labour  Party of  the country.  Though  Sir Edward had a majority ofabout 10 in the  Douse of Representatives, he invited  the Opposition  to join wdth him in the formation, of a National Government, for war purposes, and.  Dr. Lloyd, who wasLeader of the joint Parties in. Opposition, took office  in a Cabinet which had six repre-sentatives  from  each side.   Though the matter of. Conscription has not been in directissue, it has been, seen  for some time past  that  in certain districts of  the country thefull quota  of  men vdio should have enlisted li tve not  done so, and  members of theConservative  Party have  realised that  some form of compulsion will be  necessary.However, about 90  per cent, of the remaining young men of the country are fisher-men, and the  Fishermehs Union have not,  as yet, felt able to take  a definite line uponthe subject of compulsory service.   In August last the life of Parliament was extended,on the understanding that a General Election should take place this year, but when itwas seen, that the Conscription issue must be raised,  together wdth other  issues  uponwhich,  the  parties were divided, Sir  Edward  Morris decided to retire in order that national unity might be secured, and that there should  be no differences between theparties upon vital issues affecting the prosecution of-the war.  Dr. Lloyd, therefore,who  has been  Acting Premier during  Sir Edward  Morris&apos;  absence  in England, wdllassume the reins of Government, and.  it  is anticipated  that  there will, be practicallyonly  one Party at the coming election.                       A USTR A LI AN C OMMONWEALTI I.    ddie latest figures in the Conscriiition Referendum  (including the  soldiers&apos; votescounted up to the present) show the following result :               Against        -                               1,121,000              For   -         -         - .        -         -   945,000                                   Majority against      -    176,000The votes of the Australian forces  included in the above show 51,000 for and 56,000against.   It is estimated that there are still 128,270 votes to be counted,  ddie voting in. the various States  show majorities  against conscription, in.  all States (exclusive ofthe Federal Territories) except Western Australia and  Tasmania.  In the latter state majority of 381 in favour of the Government proposals is recorded up to the present.1As regards  the Federal Territories, the  vote in  favour of conscription shows 1,314,and against I, 134.    Meetings of  both the National  Party and the official Labour Party will be held on 3rd January for the purpose  of considering the respective courses to be adopted,  inthe present situation  by the Government  and the Opposition.   It is anticipated that   1 By a clerical error in the last Report the figure for  the Opposition vote in Tasmania was given as88,0.Q0 instead of 33,000.  The figures should have been-For 33,831, and against 33,450.
                                SOUTH  AFRICA.    ddie Ministers  of the  Union  Government have decided  to  revive the  recruitingcampaign energetically immediately the contingents come back from  Fast Africa anda sufficient  time has elapsed for the men to recover their health  and to be induced tore-enlist for European service.    ddie Union Government have decided to hold a conference of all War RecruitingCommittees at the end  of January in order to take measures to ensure that  adequatereinforcements shall be available for the South African Infantry  Brigade until  theend of the war.    With  reference  to  the supply  of glycerine  for the manufacture of explosives for mines (vide Report No. 47), the  Union.  Government report that the New  TransvaalChemical Company is purchasing a thousand tons of copra from  Ceylon which willenable them to increase the production  of  glycerine  and to leave  as  a by-productnearly 400 tons of cake available for cattle food,  ddie British Ministry of Shipping arebeing asked, to facilitate the shipment of the 1,000 tons of copra from Colombo overa period of live months.    ddie  Union Government have  been informed that there is  no objection  to  thenaturalisation of citizens of the United States who are not  of military age (which, inthat country,  is from 21. to 31), or of  those  American subjects who enlist  in HisMajesty&apos;s forces.    A  congress of Trade Union Delegates assembled at Johannesburg have urged theUnion Government to take control of the food markets and empower the magistratesto fix prices.  In the event of profiteering not being dealt with immediately, they havethreatened drastic action on the part of the organised labour of the country.                           GERMAN EAST  AFRICA.     :  &quot;    General Northey reports that the situation  of the main body of- the enemy is  not known, but that they appear to be widely dispersed, detachments being reported as La-west as Mwembe.   ddie Portuguese have retired to Uniango.    4761-1                             itthe  Government will resign office, but. that another administration will  he formed from the National Party,  either  under Mr.  Hughes or under one of  his  presentcolleagues, possibly Mr. Cook (Leader of-:-the  liberal Party:prior&apos; to the formation ofthe National Government)  or Mr;&apos;Watt (who is the present Minister for  Works and railways, and who was formerly &quot;Premier, of Victoria).  In any case, Parliament willmeet on 9th January.   Commenting on.dhe  result  of  the  Referendum  figures, theCommonwealth Treasurer (Sir John lhhrest) states that  it is  clear that the vote wasnot given on the merits of the necessity of  reinforcing the men at the front. &apos; &quot;ddiewhole:matter,&quot; he declares, &apos;&apos;was clouded by political and personal bias and personal&quot; interest, and  in addition by the unthinking natural opposition of people, accustomed&quot; to unlimited freedom, to compulsion.in. any form.&quot;    With regard to shipbuilding in Australia, the Prime Minister  has announced thatit  has been  decided to  commence the Commonwealth scheme as  soon as possible bythe construction of two standard steel ships at Melbourne and two similar vessels atWalsh Island, Sydney.    ddie question  of the control of  the  New South  Wales coal mines is now beingconsidered  by the State Government.  Owing to the strikes in October  last,  theGovernment took over the control of the coal mines with the  intention of exercisiug ageneral, control for a period, and paying  the owners in respect of  the amount of  coalproduced, but it is understood that the more complete nationalisation of the mines isnow under consideration.    ddie record for the year 1917 in  regard  to  Repatriation  has been  issued by theGovernment.  This shows  that 4(5,072 men have returned to Australia from  active service, and. of these 87,230  have been discharged  from, the Army.  Many of thereturned soldiers  have taken up their former employment,  while others  have  beengiven suitable work.  Those who are so far incapacitated as to  lie unemployable are receiving pensions.  For those who.have already taken advantage of the repatriationscheme, an  expenditure  of  153,000&apos;. has  already  been incurred  in. connection, with trade, classes,&apos;surgical  aid,  vocational training, &amp;c.  ddie figures show an average  ofabout 17?. per head that has either been given or lent to  returned soldiers.
   Owing to the termination of the operations against the enemy forces in East Africa,it is stated in the Paris Press that the Belgian Government intend offering the Congonative troops for service in Europe or elsewhere.                        PORTUGUESE EAST AFRICA.   ddie retiring Governor-General has publicly announced  that  the native rebellionhas been finally subdued.   An enquiry is being held into the causes of the rebellionwdth a vieAv to the infliction of punishment in the proper directions.PART  II.-FOREIGN  AFFAIRS.                               ALLIED AFFAIRS.    Sir G. Greene  learns that the situation  at Ydaclivostoek is bad and will soon fieseriously aggravated by the distress arising from unemployment, shortage of  supplies,and lack of money, and of  credits  for  salary of  Government servants.  He urgesthat money should be sent from  Petrograd.  On  20th December  at Habarosk theCommissioner of the Provisional Government for Eastern  Siberia handed  over his powers to representatives of the  Zemstvos and  the  town register.  These decided  toform  a  committee of six, being one from each province and one from each Cossackdistrict,-  to continue the local administration until the meeting of  the  ConstituentAssembly,   ddiis administration is challenged by the Leninist Council of Soldiers and workmen&apos;s Delegates,  and  Sir C.  Greene  suggests the  advisability of immediaterecognition being  given  to   the  Zemstvos  Committee   by the  Allied  Consuls.His Majesty&apos;s  Government is considering  measures  to  safeguard  the  very large amount  (635,000  tons) of  war  material now accumulated at  Vladivostock.  Sir 0.Greene  advises  the immediate  despatch of  Allied warships.   Since the visit  of a japanese warship alone would provoke trouble, he would prefer that a British or other allied ship should be sent simultaneously.    Sir C. Spring Rice reports that  the  Japanese Ambassador to  the United states has been recalled to Japan,   lie had stated  definitely to  the  United States ForeignOffice that Japan had no intention of landing troops in Vladivostock, but had,  however,previously observed to Sir C. Spring Rice that  he  believed Japan would  mobilise ifthere  was a prospect  of Germany obtaining control of Russia.   The  United states navy Department  learns that numbers  of Japanese  are  embarking from the WestCoast of America for Japan, and Sir C. Greene reports rumours of naval and military preparations.   The United States  Government  appears  to think Japan desires  toprevent  China  taking violent  measures  against  the  Russians  at Harbin.   ddieUnited.   States   Government  is  opposed,  to  a  Japanese  landing,  as  likely  to arouse  resentment  in  Russia  and America ;   opinion  in  the   United  states would  press  for  American  participation,   which  is  undesirable  both   on political  and   military  grounds.   Sir  C.  Greene  learns  from  a  good  sourcein vladivostock that if Japanese troops arrived  . alone, the whole Russian  garrisonwould oppose them, whereas  if Allied,  troops, including British, were landed, 10,000out of 18,000 men of the garrison and all. the officers would join them.  He is advisedfrom, the same source that the despatch of suitable British officers to restore order and organisation would be welcomed by the majority of the population. Americans wouldnot fie well received, as the United  States is under suspicion of  aiming at  economicexploitation of the country,   ddie Foreign Office has reason to think that the  Japanesemay feel themselves justified in landing a force, and that  in  this case, though theymight accept British assistance,  they would wish  to retain control of the operation..    M. Clemenceau has accepted the  proposal  for  General  Nash  to conduct thetransport  enquiry agreed  to  by  the  Supreme  War   Council  at  Versailles on1st December  191,7, and  steps  have been taken to  obtain the concurrence  of theItalian Government.    The War Cabinet has referred  to the  Shipping  Controller the question of  coalsupply, described by British officers as the principal problem exercising the  attentionof the Italians.
    Pending further consideration by the French. Government, the French Black Listfor Switzerland will he the only list on which licences will be refused.    The Berliner Lokal  Anzeiger hears that  in the next few  days further  miningproperties  in Poland in which the Entente is principally interested will  be  sold atauction.   The first  to be dealt with will be the Sosnowi.cz Company (which was formed for coal  mining, the  winning of ore,  and furnace  operations),  and  the  CzeladzCompany.    Sir C. Spring Pice reports that the Bolshevists have seized the Russian Branch ofthe National City Bank of New Pork and have arrested the manager.    Sir C. des  Graz reports that the Serbian Premier has returned to Corfu, after six weeks&apos; absence in France and Italy, impressed by  the  display of Allied  energy.  Hewill proceed to Salonika to discuss with the Crown Prince  the general situation andthe desirability of convoking the Skupchina either at Corfu or Salonika.    Tin-;  Finnish  delegation  under  Mr.  Gripenberg  which  is charged with the notification  of  Finnish  independence   to  Scandinavian  countries  (vide  ReportNo. 48)  was received on 28th  December by the King  of Sweden.   The Finnishdeclaration  demanded that  the free States of  the  world  should recognise Finland-as completely independent  and urged the right of small  nations to  determine  theirdestiny.   In reply  the  King expressed the warm sympathy  of  his  Governmentand himself regarding FinlancPs  efforts for independence, but  he emphasised that theimportant point was the possibility of an agreement  between Finland  and Russia onthe subject (apart from  the  attitude  of other Powers), as  to which he stated he had reason to hope for  a favourable issue.   Tbe response of the King has  not met with the. approval  of the  Activist newspapers and  even the  most prominent  Liberalpapers refer to it  as  colourless.  Sir  M. Findlay  reported  (1st January)  that the-deputation  was  expected  in Christiania  after  paying  visits to  Stockholm  andCopenhagen.   He expresses the view that if Sweden and Denmark recognise Finnishindependence, it will be  very difficult for Norway to refuse to adopt a similar course.    ddie German Wireless reports that a Finnish  delegation, has waited upon theImperial Chancellor  and  pointed out  that Finland  attaches  great  importance to obtaining the recognition of Germany,  to whom the people  feel  themselves drawn bya  strong  community  of cultural interests.   The Imperial  Chancellor expressedsympathy with the Finnish nation, but  stated that the  recognition,  of Finland&apos;independence  depended  on  the good  understanding  between that  country and russia.  This understanding, he added, was made easier  through, the announcementof the Russian Foreign Minister  that Russia would meet the wishes of Finland if sheaddressed herself to the Russian  Government.    Idle British Government have informed. Sir Spring Rice  that until the matter of effective control has been set on foot there is a probability of food exported to Finland.finding its way into Germany or being  seized by the Bolshevists.  It is stated that trade between Germany and Finland  is practically open.  Sir E. Howard has beenasked to report as to the steps that may be necessary to  ensure that food imported.into Finland shall be utilised by the Finnish people.    Sir E. Howard reports that the Swedish  Government has handed a note  to theEnemy Powers regarding the Aland Islands, in the course of which  it is  stated thatthe regime of servitude recognised by the Treaty of Paris  could only be altered bythe  Signatory Powers.   Recognising  that  the Paris Treaty  does  not meet the necessities of the case, the Swedish. Government suggests that the islands should be declared a neutral zone,  and calls attention to the importance of the  matter in view ofthe possible independence of Finland.                                   FRANCE.    Press reports state that  the preliminary examination  of the Bolo case has nowbeen completed.   The  report has been forwarded to the Military Governor of Paris,-and the case will probably come before a court-martial in February.  On 30th Decemberthe Chamber adopted the Senate Bill dealing with procedure in the Senate as a HighCourt.  It seems likely that  the case of M. Malvy will come before the Senate next month.    Lord  Bertie reports that the Chamber on 28th  December, by 425 votes  to  73,adopted the Government Bill, for the calling up of the 1919 class, and authorised theGovernment to. recall  the old classes of  1889, 1890 and  1-89.1 to undertake certainurgent work near  the  front during January and  February.  A demand was made bythe Socialist Deputy Deguise for unity of recruitment of Allied effectives.
                                     ITALY.   In  a despatch&quot;dated 14th.December, Sir It. Rodd reported that  Signor.Nitti,  theMinister of  the  Treasury, had declared himself  as determined to  press  on  the campaign against enemy agents in Italy.  He had already, it appears, had a difference of opinion on  the  subject with Baron Sonnino, when  he contended  that  even ifreprisals were made by Germany, the duty of vigorous action was none the less  clear.While the attitude of Signor Nitti in this matter was considered by Sir R. Rodd  to  beundoubtedly sound, the probability was expressed that  he would  eventually come tologgerheads  with  the Minister for Foreign  Affairs.  There is. a  general  belief that signor Nitti is ambitious of  taking the place of  Baron Sonnino,  and Sir R. Roddstates  that  it  would not  surprise him if:  he  aimed before  long at displacing  thePresident of  the  Council  also, thus endeavouring to  concentrate  all the executive-power in his own hands.  In an interview with a  representative of the  Corriere deltaSera,  Signor Nitti  is  reported to have  stated that  until  the  Italian  Army wasreconstituted, it was  necessary for  the Allies  to maintain 500,000 men  in Italy.  Hehas stated bis belief to Sir R. Rodd that the spirit of the people is still good,  but thatif coal and.grain fail  it  will be bound in.  the  end to give way ; but a point on whichhe  is  entitled  to speak with  more authority,  as representing  the  Treasury, is  the urgency with  which he insists upon the  necessity of  larger  monthly  credits forexchange purposes.    Signor Nitti has been invited to visit London  at an early date, in  order to discussvarious matters concerning the Italian military  and  internal situation.    A press telegram  announces that owing to the shortage of coal, the Italian  Govern-merit proposes  to issue coal tickets.   Writing from Florence, Mr.  Herbert Trenchmakes the following suggestion in  regard, to the supply of coal and. wheat to Italianconsumers :           Among the main causes of all tbe Italian  war troubles, which have deferred       the victory of  the Western Allies by at least   a year, was the failure to supply       Italy with sufficient wheat and. coal.          Coal, I learn,  is delivered  at the ports for about 57s. a ton.  It costs  the       poor Italian consumer  720  lire  a ton.   He naturally goes without it, and next       winter -will have no wood to  burn, either.   Now, besides the working of new       lignite mines,  .1 suggest the  appointment of Government agents by the Allied.       Governments jointly in every considerable  Italian  town,  who shall retail the &apos;       Allies&apos; wheat  and coal  at the minimum cost of  delivery on the quays.  This       measure is  necessary.   (Here nearly all  railways are owned,  by  the Italian       Government, and.  so can easily co-operate with  the  ports.)   But, if necessary,.       the British  and  American  Governments,  failing  more active co-operation by       the Italian.  Government, which  lacks  energy and.  rapidity, should  at  once       obtain leave from the Italians to appoint their own official British and American       coal and  wheat  distributors  to sell  at proper  prices under our  flags,   ddie       existing robbery is due to the middleman profiteer, and to  high exchange  and       general, ignorance  and  apathy.   Wise propaganda is  practical.  What  better        instructors or friends of the people could, be  found than such agents?    In  an article  entitled &quot; Against England &quot; in the Messaggero  of 22nd  December,Signor Ciciotti, a member of the Chamber of Deputies, exposes the  endless  attemptsof  Germany  to divide  the Allies,  and the special  effort made in that direction byspreading calumnies against England.                                 GREECE.The Intelligence Bureau reports on 22ud December as follows :--       &quot;... The Greek people are  still not  quite  satisfied  as  to  the practical   efforts of M.  Venizelos&apos; Mission  and. the  economic and  political,  advantages   which will  accrue to Greece  as  a result.   The latter, the  political side of   Greece&apos;s demands, is shown in the wish for some assurance that Greece, by   taking part  in the war, will, be able to  serve the cause clear to the  heart of   every Greek patriot, the liberation and the  union of the whole Greek  race.   The A thine, for instance, criticises Mr. Balfour for not attending to the rights   of Greece, together with those  of  Serbia and Rumania, in his recent speech..
      .  .  . The recent publication! by the  Russian  Maximalists  of  the  Treaty      concluded with Italy in A^ril 1.915, with, its  clause assigning the Dodecanese      to Italy, may serve  as a handle  to Anti-Entente propagandists in Greece  and      strengthen these misgivings: as  to the Entente&apos;s favourable  attitude towards      Greek aspirations, eA^en so whole-hearted a Venizelist and  pro-Entente paper      as Nea Ellas has not abated one jot of these demands, which include not only      the Dodekanese, but also the Greek parts of ddirace and Asia Minor and Cyprus,      as well as Greek co-operation in any international settlement of  the question      of Constantinople.&quot;          ddie report proceeds to point out that  &quot; economic reconstruction  ... is an      indispensable  preliminary   to  any effective  mobilisation  of the  country.      Consequently it is announced that about 4,000,OOOL of the Allied loan is to be      devoted to economic reconstruction ...          &quot; Only (1) the assurance of  regular food supplies from the Allies, (2) some      definite  guarantee  that Greek  national  aspirations  will not  be  disregarded      and (3) adequate military support on  the part of the Allies to the Macedonian      front would suffice to strengthen the hands of the pro-war party in Greece and      to bring over to them  the bulk of. the people, which still hesitates to adopt their      policy firmly  ... If the Entente fails  to  satisfy the needs of Greece  now, it      will fail to secure Greek support later, and  its failure will mean the failure of      M. Venizelos.  . . . ddie conciliatory tone of the Venizelist press towards Italy      is evidence that Greece recognises the necessity of Italo-Greek co-operation too      strongly to allow this to be  deterred from  it even by Italian policy in Epirus.      and the Dodekanese.   Further, Greece, Serbia, and Rumania are  now working      in closer co-operation  than at. any time since 1913  . .  . Coupled with co-opera-      tion with Italy, this new Balkan Alliance, if  supported by the Western  Powers      and allowed  to throw its whole military force, with reasonable hope of success,      into the  struggle,  may prove the first  solid, foundation  stone  of  the future      Balkan Federation .   The report  also  touches  on  the Greek aspirations to a  &quot; Greek Republic of  theEuxine.&quot;   The  Foreign Office has  instructed  Sir C.  Spring Rice to join, with the french ambassador in urging the United States Government to provide immediate military supplies to Greece,  in order that the Greek Army may be placed on an effective footingby the beginning of February-   Lord Grauville reports that the Austro-Hungarian Government has made a proposal.to the  Greek Government  through the Netherlands Government  under  which, allnationals of either country may be repatriated from the other if they sp desire.                                  PORTUGAL.   In  conversation, with  Major-General Barnardiston, President Paes  emphaticallydenied that the Revolution was monarchical, or pro-German, either in its inception  or its designs.  He declared  it was a purely Republican movement, having as its soleobject the removal of an inefficient, despotic, and detested regime ; and that  the new government would, be absolutely pro-Ally in every way, and most anxious to  fulfil allthe engagements already entered, into with Great Britain.   Major-General. Barnardistonconsiders that the good faith of the Revolutionary leaders will be tested by the  action they take in  regard  to British representations concerning matters  in  East Africa.(See  Reports Nos. 43-46, under &quot; Portuguese East Africa.&quot;)  The total losses amongtroops  and civilians during the Revolution, amounted, according to the Portuguesepress, to about 100 killed  and rather.over 500 wounded.                          ENEMY ALLIED AFFAIRS.   A. press telegram states that M. Radoslavoff, the Prime Minister,  read in  theSobranye on 30th December the following statement :           &quot; ddie Russian Delegation on 27th December made to the Delegations  of the       Central Powers the following proposals :           &quot; (1) The war between Bulgaria and Russia is ended.          &quot; (2) ddie status quo ante helium regarding commercial treaties and Consular                and other conventions is re-established.     4761-1                              c
          &quot; (3) With regard to the,Danube question, it will be decided to-morrow at a                plenary meeting of all the Delegations, that- Bulgaria  shall have a                representative on the Danube Commission.        :  &quot;We accepted all  these  important principles,  and both,  parties mutually       congratulated each other on the result.&quot;   [The  Danube Commission, which was constituted in  .155(3,  consisted  before thewar of representatives of Austria-Hungary,  France,  Germany,  Great Britain, Italy,Rumania, Russia, and Turkey.  Its seat  is at Galatz.  Since 1904  the commission had been reconstituted on a triennial basis.]   Sir G. Barclay learns that Naval Delegates of Bulgaria and Turkey have arrived atKieff, and propose to obtain possession of the Black Sea Fleet and Littoral.   Sir H. Rumbold learns on good authority that the  Dreifus Bank,  Zurich, which  isthe correspondent of the Vienna RiHjchsbank, and is the official bank of the AustrianLegation at Berne, has declined to make further advances lo&apos;members of the AustrianLegation, stating that interest is no  longer being paid  upon the Austrian securitiesdeposited by them.                       GERMAN INTERNAL AFFAIRS.   According to  the  German AVireless Press a company has  been formed  on theinitiative  of  the Bavarian Government for  the  purpose of constructing a great shipcanal from Aschaffenburg to  Passau.   The capital  of more than five million  markshas already been considerably over-subscribed.   The  Neue  Zureher  Zeitung publishes an  account  of  an  interview with  HerrMuller, under Secretary of State for the War Nutrition Department.   Herr Muller stated that the present German bread ration, together with the extraration for those doing heavy work, was assured till next harvest.  In other  words, hedeclared, the &quot; principal part, the iron foundation of our nourishment is  secured.&quot;The  astonishing development of rabbit and goat breeding in the widest circles would prove a great  help.   [It will be remembered  that  rabbit-breeding was long  sincesuggested as a means of increasing the food supplies.]  The good potato crop would allow the  continuance of  a weekly ration of 7 lbs., wdth 3 lbs.  extra for  those doingheavy work,  and also a reserve for  the  feeding of animals, &quot; for other feeding  stuffsare  very  short.&quot;   The  recent reduction  of the  fat  ration  was  only temporary.Germany  had about 20,000,000 head of cattle, the reduction of which when  necessarywould release  fodder for the  remainder,  though milk and  fat would admittedlycontinue to be very short,  ddie stock of pigs was about 13,500,000.   The rich spoilstaken in Italy would lighten the task of feeding  the army there.  Russia as a  source of feeding stuffs had better be left out of account for the present.   Herr Midler said that  illicit dealing in food, which is proceeding on so large a scale by the action of employers and municipalities, would be punished in future withfines up to 100,000 marks (5,0Q0Z.  at pre-war rates),  and old offenders would receiveimprisonment.   The wholesale seizure of all available feeding  stuffs would doubtlessprovide sufficient supplies for everybody, but he was convinced that  this could not bedone by force, and that hidden stores could  be extracted only by personal relations  ofa private character.  In  conclusion, Herr Midler expressed the wish that the not toodistant future would bring about the United States of Europe.   According to  a press report  Germany never sends to  Switzerland the  full200,000 tons  of coal monthly  agreed  upon, and in  November she  sent only about two-thirds of this  amount.   A  Press report states that explosions  in  Germany  are  becoming increasinglynumerous.  These repeated explosions  are  causing considerable anxiety in militaryquarters, not only because of the interference with the supply of munitions therebyoccasioned, but also because of the spirit of unrest in the districts where they occur.                                NETHERLANDS.                 .   ddie Foreign Office advises Sir W. Townley that  the  question  of  the  export of horses from Holland to Germany is under  discussion with  the Dutch delegates;  but
that pending any agreement, His Majesty&apos;s Government must regard&apos;such exportation-as being in breach of the Hides Agreement.    His Majesty&apos;s Government informs Sir W. Townley that under the arrangement forthe supply of 100,000 tons of coal, pitch may under  certain specified conditions be licensed for exportation to Holland instead of coal.    The Nieuwe Gourant complains in  a very unpleasant  article that  in spite of theBritish Governments apology, bombs have  recently been dropped  on several Dutch-towns by British aeroplanes.                                 SWITZERLAND.   The Eoreign  Office  learns that negotiations by His  Majesty&apos;s Government  for a credit  loan with  the  Swiss Government have been in  danger of  prejudice owing tothe conclusion of. an American-Swiss agreement  (formally approved  by the  FrenchGovernment)  under  which 240,000  tons  of bread  grains  are  to be supplied  toSwitzerland by the Allies between  the  end of  1917 and  the next  harvest.  Thisagreement is based upon  a resolution passed at Paris by the Section du  Comite deR ayitaillem.ei.it. over the  wording of which there seems to be some misunderstandingand its  execution would  appear to  be  problematical.   Sir  .11.  Rumbold reports thathe  is  endeavouring to make clear to the Swiss  Government   and  people the  sharethat British tonnage  would probably have  to take in fulfilling an  agreement to which great  Britain is  not a  party.  It is  to  be  noted, however, that the Swiss Presidenthas now proposed  the resumption of loan negotiations  on a footing  independent  of-questions of financial conditions attaching to the war.    Sir II.  Rumbold  reports on  26th  December  that  the  Swiss  Government has confirmed, its  Neutrality  Declaration of  5th August 1914, and. reasserted its intentionto maintain and defend  its neutrality and. the Inviolability of its territory.  It claimsat the same  time,  in virtue of its  sovereign  rights and of the  Declaration of  theCongress of  Vienna  (20th November 1815), the sole  right of taking  any measures necessary for  the defence  of Swiss  territory, and. of deciding  whether and  when itshould apply for  assistance to foreign Powers.                                    NORWAY.    Sir M. Findlay learns from, the Norske Melkefabbrike that there has been no exportof milk for the past three weeks, and that no further licences are to  be granted.  ThefirnPs production has already fallen more that 50 per cent., and there is little prospect that exportation will be renewed, unless large quantities of feeding stuffs and also ofcereals  are  imported.   Sir M. Findlay points out  that in  any  blockade agreementbetween the Allies and Norway,  guarantees should,  be obtained that the export ofpyrites from Norway to Sweden, and other neutrals should be made, subject to  thecondition that neither this  commodity nor its  products should be exported either.directly or indirectly to the enemy.   Indeed, since Sweden, itself produces pyrites, the exportation of pyrites from  Norway to Sweden would seem undesirable,  since an-equivalent amount of Swedish pyrites would be thereby released.                                   SWEDEN.   The Poliiiken newspaper of 28th December stated that while, owing to shortage ofcarbide, many Swedish homes were in darkness, 250 tons of calcium carbide had beenloaded for Germany in a  Swedish West  Coast port.   On  29th  December the SocialDemohraten declared that no  licences for export of carbide  had been granted since november.   Sir C. Spring Rice  learns  through French official,  channels  from Paris  that theSwedish Delegates have  agreed to the total prohibition of exportation of  foodstuffs to Germany, with the exception of small quantities of cattle.  A  similar prohibition isto be imposed on goods similar to those imported from overseas.
    Sir. 13. Howard learns that it will he impossible to prevent the delivery of. goods,in  transit to. Finnish consignees, and  suggests a  method  of  controlled sales  in finland.    Sir  E. Howard reports  the  first - speech of Professor  Eden  as Prime Minister.,Professor Eden warned the nation against expecting immediate peace or improvementin  food  imports.  He spoke  appreciatively of the inter-Scandinavian  exchange  of commodities, by which Sweden would receive  herrings, saltpetre, and  fertilizers, but;said it was also necessary to get food and raw materials from the Central Powers andEntente.   The  Government  had concluded,  a coal  agreement  with  Germany for November and December without granting  a certain,  compensation, and negotiationsfor January were  proceeding.  For oils, &amp;c, from Austria no  foodstuff  compensation was given.  Against  a licence to export 15,000 horses to  Germany, Sweden, would receive valuable compensation partly in coal, salt, aniline dyes and lubricants, besidescertain smaller consignments to the Army and  Navy.   In connection with the licence for export of  horses, he hoped to get a supply of cereals  from  Germany on specialterms.   The  Swedish Government hoped  to  obtain  English permission  to import300,000 barrels of Norwegian  herrings ; and America  had offered  on acceptable terms.11,000 tons of petroleum, coffee, and  possibly  oils.   The  question of  Aland should.not be overlooked, on Russhps withdrawal from the war, and  better securities would:be demanded,  ddie Swedish Government desired  to meet Finland as an independent state, but recognition depended on the attitude of Russia and  the other Powers,  ddieSwedish  Government  had  no intention  of being Finland&apos;s  guardian during theorganisation of her domestic affairs.    Sir E. Howard  reports  a statement from  a good source  that negotiations are pro-oeedirig  unofficially with  the Bolshevist Commissary  Vorowski  for the  supply  of mineral, oil and  grain from. Russia to  Sweden and Denmark immediately peace issigned.   It is  further stated that  the  Germans  are to assist in the shipment of thegoods by water, and. to receive from Sweden and Denmark equivalent  value in other commodities.  SirE. Howard thinks it possible that this statement is made to frightenthe Allies into the belief that the blockade will  break down, so that they will bereadier to enter upon peace negotiations.    ddie Stockholm papers report that 600 horses have been licensed for export andwill leave on 4th January ;  also that the province of Mai mo has been granted licences.to export 1,800 horses.                                  DENMARK.   Sir R. Paget learns  that the reply of the Danish Government to  the american proposals gives a strong impression of  having been drafted under German influence.In the circumstances Sir R. Paget is inclined, to approve the probable recommendation.of the United  States Charge  cbAffaires  to  his  Government that Danish tonnage,amounting to some  450,000 tons now in American  waters should be detained and.employed as  if  requisitioned  until the  Danish Government  puts  forward more reasonable proposals ; and that no ship should  be permitted to  sail from the  UnitedStates to Denmark until an equivalent of Danish tonnage had arrived to replace  it.Unless this is done, it seems likely that the Germans will arrange for the retention  of&quot;any Danish ships which return.   The Foreign Office has instructed Sir  R. Paget  to investigate the possibility  ofprocuring Danish labour for the United. Kingdom. Four thousand skilled ploughmenand  500  unskilled  farm labourers are needed by the Board of Agriculture, and2,000 sawyers and haulyers  by the Timber Controller.                                     SPAIN.   A Press  telegram, states that the prospect of a free election, the first withinliving  memory, is  supported by the Regionalists, the parties of the Left,  and  thefollowers  of  Senor  Maura  on  the  Right;  and  opposed by  Senor  Dato  and  the conservatives.   Senor  Cambo is conducting a Regionalist campaign,  not  only in.
                                     &apos;  3:3.     .Catalonia, but in Galicia, Veziaza, Valencia  and even  Andalucia.   The Maurists, inalliance with the car lists, are  demanding the reforms of public life on  Tory lines,while the  parties of the Left, led by  Melcpiiades Alvayez, are holding meetings insupport of radical political and administrative reforms, and. in foreign affairs a policyof closer approximation,  to the  Allies.  It seems probable that  all  these  parties arelikely to gain seats at the, expense of the  two so-called. Constitutional parties, led bySenor Dato  and  Count Romanon.es respectively.  Sehor Cam bo is instituting a  partyfund ;  an example likely to be followed,  to . the disadvantage of the parties of the left. ,  It is rumoured that  in  anticipation of early peace  overtures  and the prospectof economic reconstruction  after the  war,  the Germans are prepared to spend asmuch as 1,150,0&apos;OOZ. in  order  to  secure the return of Ge.western.anoph.il members at theelections, and. thus to ensure a  powerful pro-German  element  in the  Spanish Cortes.                                   VATICAN.   Count de Salis reports that at a reception on loth December the Cardinal Secretaryof State made mention of the satisfaction with which the Rope had  received the news of the taking of Jerusalem.   He went on to say in  rather a pointed manner that hishope was that, having taken,  it, the English would keep it.                                     JAPAN.   ddie Foreign Office  Informs Sir 0. Spring Rice that arrangements are underconsideration by which the purchase by Japan of Indian cotton  is to be facilitated bythe additional supply of  rupee credits payment can also be made out of the balanceof gold imported into Japan from America.   Freight  for shipment would have to beSupplied by Japan.                                     CHINA.   Sir J. Jordan reports that as the result of firing by Bolshevist  troops at Harbinthey  were disarmed, by the Chinese.   ddie Bolshevists  have  been entrained for&apos;Manchuria under Chinese escort. Lord Bertie learns that the French  Charge cbAffairesat Peking  is in favour of leaving the matter in Chinese hands, as unless the railwayis controlled a  considerable number  of  German prisoners of war in Manchuria may find their way :nto China.    Sir J.  Jordan learns that the Bolshevists are bombarding Irkutsk ; inhabitants arebeing plundered, women raped, and children murdered,  idle Red Guards have killedthe French Consular Agent  and two  French officers.   In regard to the question of  an Allied request for  deportation of enemy subjects &apos;from China, and the liquidation of their businesses, Sir J. Jordan points  out that theChinese Government will see in this a discrimination  between. China and  the  other allied countries where  no  general  internment  is  in force.   It is therefore doubtful.whether tbe Chinese Authorities will, lie prepared to bear any share of the  cost.   TheBelgian  (loverimieiit having expressed a fear  of enemy  reprisals  in Belgium, SirF. Villiers has been  instructed  to point, out that  such  liquidation is  not  the same asconfiscation, and is the right of a belligerent Power over  an. enemy business within its jurisdiction.   This right does not belong to an occupying Power, and the liquidation of businesses in Belgium could not be justified.                                 ARGENTINA.   Sir R. Tower reports that the draft of the Wheat Convention between Great Britainand France and the Argentine  Government1 now allows for credits to His Majesty&apos;sGovernment and the French Government  up to 100 million dollars gold or paper ;  theamounts drawn on  such credits  to carry interest at 5 per cent,  per annum,  ddie    4701-1                               D
Argentine Government may draw  against tlm British and French Governments.,toequivalent amounts so advanced when,the rate of exchange does not exceed 50 penceon England and 5 francs 60 centimes on Paris.  The balance is to be covered in gold.by the two Governments within  24 months from signature unless postponement  shall jbe mutually agreed.   ddie two Governments  are  to  deposit in  the respective  Argentine  Legationsacknowledgments of all sums drawn.   A. press telegram from Buenos Aires dated 29th December, says :           &quot; The terms of the agreement which has now been reached for the purchase       of  2,500,000  tons  of  Argentine cereals are  eminently satisfactory to all       concerned.  A. generous minimum price has been agreed upon, with the object       of  benefiting producers, who, however, unfortunately became frightened at the       delay in the negotiations and have largely transferred their  produce  recently       to speculators.   The outstanding feature of  the  agreement is that the Allies in       the fourth year of war obtain credit to the extent of 40,000,000?.-at 5 per  cent.       on note of hand, alone surely almost  unprecedented, in the annals of inter-       national finance.  An important result of  the agreement will be the regulation.       of  the exchange rate with London, which from decreased  importations and       heavy selling  of meat, hides, and wool bills, coupled  with  the  expectation of       grain bills offering has  reached .14 per  cent, above par, with  every prospect       of  mounting.  1 Presuming that  the  agreement  is  ratified,  it is justifiable to       regard it as a masterly victory over German influence and propaganda here.&quot;   Sir 0. Spring Rice learns that the Argentine Ambassador to  the United  States Go-vernnient has tendered his resignation, having vainly pressed his Government  to break off relations with Germany, and being convinced that  the President of the Argentine-represents only a minority.  Sir C. Spring Rice shares the view of  the United StatesGovernment that neither  Argentina nor Chile  intends  to  rupture  relations  withGermany,  nor will -they take up  a really hostile  attitude towards  the Allies.   Mr.Hoover,  however,  believes that German . propaganda  may  make further progress,particularly  in the  labour  world,  and  doubts if the  neutrality  of the  Argentine.Republic can. lie depended on.   ddie Argentine Ambassador states that  the Presidentof-Argentina is not so much pro-German as Pacifist.  From a good source Sir 0. SpringRice  learns  that the  Argentine  Government is probably deterred, from  breaking withGermany by the fear  that Chile will alone remain.   Sir C.  Spring Rice is convinced that Cabrera  is carrying to  South America propa-ganchi for concerted  action under  German  auspices between. Mexico, Chile  and theArgentine Republic against the Allies, and in particular against the United States.   Sir (.!. Spring Rice advises the Foreign Office that the report of prospective Britishpurchases  of South American  crossbred, wools is  stiffening  prices in. the argentine and  thus - nullifying  the measures taken by the United States Government to  lower prices.   Sir E. Howard learns from a good  source&apos; that the Germans are  buying up  all-stocks of wool in the Argentine, and. any other goods they can..                                   URUGUAY.   Mr.&apos; Mitchell Lines  reports that by decree of  the Uruguayan Government  anysubmarine, whether ship or ship-of-war, flying the  German flag  or  belonging  tothe German  Navy, shall, if it enters  Uruguayan jnrisdictional  waters,  be internedtill the conclusion of  hostilities ;  its crew  also shall be interned,  and. its enginestaken, to pieces.   Mr. Mitchell. Inn.es points out that the term &quot; jnrisdictional waters &quot;might involve a break wdth. the Argentine.                                    BRAZIL   Sir C. Spring Rice reports that the United States Government intends  to do every-tliing possible to assist the Brazilian Government and does not intend to prevent thesupply to it of arms and ammunition.   The  United  States Government has no reason
to believe Unit the Brazilian -Government contemplates  offensive  action against theArgentine1 Republic ; on  the contrary, the uncertain attitude of Argentina and. the;1&apos;German- danger in South Brazil  fully warrant the Brazilian Government in taking all-military precautions.            &apos;                                   &apos;     &apos;                                 GUATEMALA.    Mr.  Young reports that incessant earthquakes since 18th November culminated on&quot;Christmas night in such violent shocks as to leave Guatemala city practically in ruins.ddie Legation offices and residence have been destroyed. , No  British subjects havebeen injured.                               UNITED  STATES.    Pi-ess telegrams report that at midday  of  28th December the United  StatesGovernment,  acting  under the  Army  Appropriation Act of 1916,  took  control  of-approximately 250,000 miles  of  American railways, and placed  them  under theadministration of Mr. McAdco as Federal Director-General  of  Railroads.  The  new order takes under Government protection stocks valued at 4,000,000,000?.,  and  affects the interests of 1,400,000 employees,  ddie Washington Post observes that &quot;the nation&quot; will  have  the  benefit  of the  consolidation  of  transportation, which ensures the&quot; speeding  up of ship construction, munition shipments, troop transportation, and&quot; central freight distribution, including coal ami food.   This freeing of  the channels&quot; of transportation means not only increased efficiency in the war-making energies  of&quot; the nation, but  also an  improved domestic  condition, including a  check on high&quot; prices, if not actual reduction.&quot;  Mr. Garfield, the Fuel Administrator,  has preparedplans for the absolute Government control of the conn try&apos;s coal mines, and is ready totake possession, operate and  distribute along the same lines as the government control of railways.    Mr. Garfield  has reported to the  President  that the shortage in available coalbetween 18th August and 24th November  amounted to over 20,000,000 tons, owingto car  shortage.   The New York Times  of 27th December states that  100 steamships,aggregating over 1 ,-000,000 tons gross, are held up in  New York Harbour through.lack of  coal.  Mr. Garfield.  urges that  railways  should, now give  priority to coal,which should be rushed to  bottle-neck points  such as  Pittsburg,  Cincinnati, and.Toledo:    ddie  United States has also virtually  taken  control of all  the&apos; Niagara  power, andformal assurances have been given to Canada that 100,000 horse-power imported  from-Canada will be used exclusively for war products.                           SHIPPING  SITUATION.   According to the War Trade  intelligence Report, the total  tonnage of 500 tonsgross in the case of steamers and  100 tons gross in the case of sailing vessels reported as lost on  account of enemy activity  during the period  21st  to  27th  Decemberinclusive is  116,384 tons gross, of which 71,005 tons were British.  The total tonnagelost in. the preceding week, Pith  to 20th December, was 67,808 tons, of which. 43,224were British.   With regard  to the proposals made by the United States for a Shipping Agreementwith Denmark, the  War Trade Intelligence Bureau reports that the Danish Govern-in ent considers that these  involve no adequate provision for Danish shipping require-ments.  As, however,  there are  430,000 tons,  dead weight, of Danish shipping in american ports, it is anticipated  that a threat to requisition these vessels would  havea great deal of effect at Copenhagen,   ddie British Government meanwhile  insist thatany arrangement must allow for the 200,000  tons, dead weight, of Danish shipping toremain in the Anglo-French, coal  trade (vide Report No. 48).   The British  Minister  at  Stockholm has  taken  steps  to  ensure that the Swedishpublic shall  be made  fully alive  to the fact  that  they  need not  be  dependent  upon
German coal.   TheLiberal Party have learnt with surprise that  a British oiler  was-made in June last to supply  Sweden with some  250,000 tons  of  coal a month,  andthat; this would have been delivered in. Sweden more cheaply than German coal, if the-Swedish Government had agreed to arrange mutually satisfactory,terms.   ddie temporary Shipping  Agreement&apos; provisionally arranged  with the1 Swedishdelegates  in London included,  a  provision that the United States shall have power to-charter for four months the Swedish vessels now detained in their ports, and  that thevessels now  in. the  ports  of  the  European  Allies shall  be  similarly placed at  the-disposal of the Inter-Allied&apos;Chartering Executive for three months.  The Governmentnegotiations  for  concluding the Agreement  are  dependent  upon the consent of the-Swedish shipowners.   A proposal has been made  to  the  Norwegian Government by  the  United StatesWar Trade Board that no foodstuffs except fish, and  fish products shall  be exported to Germany  from Norway, and  that  such products shall in any case be limited to4,000  tons a month.  If  tbe full conditions are accepted  by Norway, the Allies  will facilitate  the  importation of  the necessary requirements to that country.   Sir M.Findlay,  however, is  of  opinion  that  the  Norwegian  Government  is  protractingnegotiations in anticipation of an early peace.    With,  regard  to  tbe  shipbuilding  programmes of the British  and United  states government, a  Board  of Trade  deport  of  21st December submits that&apos; the  pro-grammes of both countries are inadequate on the  ground  that the  British Governmentis nearing the limit of  the  amount  that can.  lie saved,  upon,  imports, that the  warclaims on shipping may increase, that  the losses may be  greater than are  nowanticipated,  arid that a large army from the  United States has  to be moved  and maintained.    In  order to prevent a serious shortage of ships, it is estimated  that theBritish and  United States Governments  should  jointly  work  up to a shipbuildingrate of nine million gross  tons per annum by next autumn.    It is further pointed  out in  the Report  that  the total of British steam  merchantvessels of 500 gross  tons and over  remaining  to the  United Kingdom on.  30thNovember 19,17 was  about  15,850,000 tons gross, which included, however, about1,000,000 tons  in  respect of  vessels  under  repair  or  completion.   Of  the total available tonnage  it is  estimated  about 3,750,000 tons  are used  bv the Armv and navy, .1,600,000 by the  Allies, 700,000 by the Dominions  and Colonies&quot; while 1,300,000 are permanently abroad, and  1,000,000 account for oilers;   it will thus be seen  that less than 0,500,000 are  left for the ordinary trade of the  United Kingdom,  including munition, imports.  The Report estimates that the position in 1919 is not likely to be much better than in 1918, and  it may be worse in view of the need  of  tonnage in connection with  the moving and maintenance of the United States Army.    ddie British Government have informed Sir C. Spring Rice that, with reference to the  shipping  negotiations between the  United  States and Spain, the most  hopeful method of obtaining Spanish  vessels for the purposes of trade in the zone of war is by a system of  differentiation of freight rates.  It  is pointed out that it is owing to the competition  of Switzerland  that  a Spanish, vessel can  be  utilised  in  Swiss trade at more profitable.rates than in war trade,  ddie first necessity therefore is  to  prevent the  competition of Switzerland.   This  would also have  the  effect  of  reducing the amounts paid to the ships engaged in Spanish trade and so bring about reduction in the price of coal in. Spain, which is now having  an. influence noon the political unrest in that country.    Sir 0. Spring Pice is further instructed to submit to the United States Government a proposal that  they should adopt measures  to prevent the chartering by Switzerland of Spanish  ships, and  while securing 100,000 tons of shipping from. Spain, maintain the right to provide for the  tonnage  necessities of Switzerland  out of the Spanish tonnage  thus obtained.                            PEACE DISCUSSIONS.   Sir  II.  Rumbold  learns  that  M.  Shipkoff,  a  close friend of  the  King  of  the bulgarians,  and  for many years  a  member  of  the  Sob ran jo, has  intimated  to  theUnited States Legation at Berne that Bulgaria has  no intention of sending  troops tothe Italian front or of attacking General Guilla^m.at&apos;s army at Salonika;  nor wouldshe send troops to the assistance of Turkey.  She is content to hold her  present lines..If once the Austria its got into  Salonika, they could  not be. trusted to  relinquish it-
                                  i &apos;I 3 7;;;;.;   --Bulgaria  is apprehensive  of  the  Central European idea, and would prefer economic relations with the Allies rather than the Central Powers after the  war.   Bulgaria isclearly  alarmed  at  the possibility of a declaration of war  by the United  StatesGovernment, nnd would probably  be glad to find a way out Of the war.    Sir E. Howard learns that the  Bolshevists are ready to break off negotiations for separate peace with the Central. Powers, provided that the Entente Governments willgrant, passports  so as to  permit of  a serious International.  Labour Conference aiming at, a general,  peace.  Further, they are  prepared to continue the war if  the CentralPowers  should  decline to accept  the  general  conditions  laid  down  by such aconference.                                                         &apos;    Sir A. Idardinge learns from a  good  Russian source  in  Spain that the Bolshevistpropaganda is beginning  to  infect the German troops  on the Eastern Front. - Alsothat, the Russian General Stall&apos; understands  that the Germans have already violatedthe clause of the armistice regarding non-removal of  troops to the Western Front, andbelieves that a considerable part of the Russian Army and even of the Revolutionarieswould  turn against Lenin,  if this were established; indeed.,  if exact information  ofsuch movements could be furnished, the Russian  General  Stall: would,  endeavour  tobreak the armistice. -    According to a  Press telegram from Brest-Litovsk via Berlin, the delegations of theCentral Powers and  Russia  on  28th December terminated  the  discussion  of  thosepoints1 which, in the event of a general peace, would have to be settled between,  the negotiating powers.   The  German delegates accepted  the  Russian proposals withqualifications, evading the really definite points at issue.   - Sir  G. Buchanan reports a hitch in the negotiations between Russia and Germany,due&apos;to tbe refusal, of Germany to  allow- Poland,  and Courland to determine,their formof Government except while still under occupation.   It is also rumoured, that germany has provoked a rupture by demanding &quot;free import of German goods into Russia.    Sir  (.-!-. Buchanan  learns  that the Central.  Powers are  under no illusion  as to thenature  and probable duration of Bolshevist rule, but that, they desire to employ them.as a channel for negotiation with  the Allies.    They are depressed at  the anarchy prevailing in Petrograd.  The present, conditionof the country is beyond  the  assistance of  any single Power, and  a  joint control  byEngland,  France,  Germany,  and America  would  bo  necessary to restore normal. conditions.  Apart, from Trotsky  there is nobody of political or executive capacity.    Sir  C. Spring Rice learns that the United States  foreign  Office has  received information from Budapest and Vienna, which appears to corroborate that both Austria and Germany desire the Allies to  negotiate.    Sir G. Buchanan reports  that on 29th December Trotsky issued a message to the peoples and Governments of  tbe Allied  countries, of which the following.are the  most important passages :-            &quot; Two  programmes were submitted at Brest-Litovsk, the German and the        Russian.   The  latter  sets forth,  as its  task the. creation of such conditions as        will enable every nationality to have  complete freedom of national development,        and will unite all.  nations  in economic and cultural  co-operation.   The  former        indicates that the countries at war wdth Russia do not intend forcibly to annex        any territories  captured   during  tbe war.  By  renouncing  new  forcible        annexations the  enemy  Governments  depart   from  the  principle  of  old        annexations that  the domination of tire  strong over  the weak  is sanctioned        by historical  precedent.   This means that the destiny of  Alsace-I.jorra.ine,        Transylvania, Bosnia, etc., on the one hand, and Ireland,  Egypt, India, &amp;c,        on the other are not subject to  revision.  Such  a programme appears to  be a        compromise between  Imperialist and Labour  Democracy.   Nevertheless, the        fact that such  a  programme  is submitted constitutes a great forward  step.        It is impossible now for the Allies  to  state that  the war is  conducted for the        liberation of Belgium and other conquered territories.   It  is necessary  for     :&apos;  them, clearly and accurately to state what the peace programme of the Entente        Powers and America is.  Do they together with  us  demand  (he granting of the        right of self-determination to the peoples of Alsace-Lorraine, Galicia, Posen,        Bohemia  and the  South  Slavonic  ccrantries ?  If  so, are  they willing to        grant  similar rights to the peoples of Ireland, India, Madagascar, Indo-China,        &amp;c, in the same way  as the Russian Revolution grants rights to the peoples        of Finland, Ukraine, &amp;c,   Up to the present, the Allied Governments have  not        shown readiness to  join in Genuine Democratic peace.  Their attitude towards        the principle of national  self-determination is  no less suspicious than that of
         Germany and Austria,   It the Allies continue  to  block the cause of a liberal         peace, the Russian delegation will continue negotiations,   if the Allied Govern-         meats are  willing to  use this last opportunity;, general negotiations may  be         started immediately in  a  neutral  country.   If  on  the other  hand  the Allied    -.    , Governments again refuse  to participate in the negotiations, the. labouring        ....classes will be forced to seize power from  those  who cannot  or  who will -not         give peace to the people.&quot;      ddie  Bolshevist organ Izvestia declares  that the  qualified German  acquiescence   has been forced by the masses of  the Central Powers upon their Imperialistic rulers,   but that nevertheless the enemy delegates  are evidently opposed to the restoration of   a united Poland.   It invites the-people of  the Allied countries  to force their Govern-   ments to participate in the negotiations,  and  baulk  German  schemes based on the   German&apos;belief that the Allies would not negotiate.      A. Ptess telegram of 27th  December  suggests  that the Bolshevists  may  meet  a   serious stumbling block in the flat refusal  of the Central Powers  to accept the  third   Russian proposal, that nationalities not hitherto in the enjoyment of political, indepen-  &apos;deuce should, be allowed to decide their political future by referendum.      ddie  Rumanian  reply to Trotsky&apos;s protests states that Russian troops are pillaging   in Rumania, and that corn now required both for Rumanians and  for  Russian troops   can. be obtained only from Ukraine,  ddie Russian  Commissary considers, this  reply   &quot; extremely unsatisfactory.&quot;                                                ...,      Dr. David Soskice, late Private Secretary to M. Kerensky, in an interview with the   Press, regards Germany&apos;s  participation as a proof that, under the stress of  the grave   internal, position not only of herself but of her Allies, she desires to restore ,the - -status   quo unite Ifellum,   lie believes  that the Bolshevists are moving  hand in hand with: the   German. Majority Socialists, and for this  reason he thinks it would be  unwise  for the   Allies to reject the proposals unconditionally.  He  suggests that Germany should  be   required  to  agree  that at any Conference convoked to discuss the question of peace,   not  only  diplomats, but also duly  elected delegates from the Parliaments of every   country,  and fully authorised representatives of  the  Labour organisations  should   attend.                                      -      On  27th December, M. Pichon, in reply to the Socialists, stated that  the Goyern-   ment  would,  play  no  part in the Brest  negotiations until   a legally  constituted   Government  had been  created in Russia,  In  defining the   French war aims he   declared  &quot; victory  first  and  foremost   .  .  .  the  deliverance of  territory,  the   restitution of territory  torn away by force,  and consequently the return  of Alsace-   Lorraine,   dust reparation and  damages;  no  idea  of  the enslavement of  foreign   populations, and the  guarantee of  a lasting peace by general agreements   We have duties  towards oppressed Belgium, Serbia, and Poland  .  .   .   this policy   of  the  right of  nationalities applies to  Armenians, Syrians, and  the people of the   Lebanon.   .   ,   .  The question of Alsace-Lorraine is a moral problem, and according   as   it, is&apos; given  back  or  refused the  peace of the  nations  will  or  will  not  be   lasting.   .   .  Germany is  trying to o draw us into these Maximalist  negotiations.   On the day we receive  a direct proposal of peace we will examine it.&quot;      By 411.  votes  to 99  the  attitude of the Foreign Minister  was approved by the   Chamber.      In reply to the request of  a delegation of the Socialist group of the  Chamber for   passports to  Petrograd where they proposed to  prevent the conclusion by Russia  of   a separate  peace, or at least  to  render  it as little  prejudical  as possible  to France,   M. Clemenceau  replied that lie  did. not  doubt  their  patriotism or  their  intentions,   but that  the situation at Petrograd  was  too disturbed to allow of any useful result   from their mission, which might also be misinterpreted in  other quarters.      On 26th  December at Ci^i%iiont Ferrancl,  a   Conference of the Confederation   Gene rale du Travail, by 1.61 votes to two abstentions, adopted a resolution demanding\   that  the country should be informed of the conditions on which a general, just and   lasting peace could be concluded,  ddie Conference recalled &quot;the formulas  which are   those of  President Wilson and the Russian  Revolution&quot;  and were always and have   remained those of  tbe French, working class : &quot;&quot;No  annexations, right of peoples  to   &quot; dispose of themselves, reconstifution in their independence, and territorial integrity   &quot; of  countries now occupied,  reparation for damage  done, no war  indemnities, no   &quot; economic war after cessation of  hostilities, liberty of straits  and. seas, institution  of   &quot; compulsory arbitration to settle international  differences, constitution  of a  Society   &quot; of  Nations.&quot;
    The Conference  affirmed  the  right of the working classes of all  countries; andthat of France  in particular, to join in an  early  International  Conference,  and ifnecessary, to summon one.                                                   i    The/French Press urges a  declaration of Allied aims, so that just claims may be formulated and ambitions, if  any,  exposed.   The German, professions of  principle,even if hypocritical,  have been made  in solemn form and cannot be disregarded.    Speaking  in  the Chamber  of the  Brest-pitovsk  negotiations,  Signor Orlandosaid :           &quot; I  think it is time to  foil  the manoeuvre by which the  Central Empires       are  exploiting a means  of keeping up the  spirit of  their  peoples  arid of       depressing and  corrupting the spirit  of their  adversaries,  by  appearing as       defenders of peace and making out that the attitude of the Entente prevents       peace.  The  Entente  wants peace;  it is  only the Entente that wants it,       for it wants it in the only possible  form- namely,  a just, honourable, lasting-       peace,  by means of  clear and loyal agreements&apos;,   ddie Central  Empires  are       employing a  strange form  to  ask the  Entente to  intervene  in  the relations       between them and a Government not recognised by the Entente, for  it is only       a Government de facto until, the meeting of the Constituent Assembly,  and it       is not recognised by large parts of Russia.&quot;    As regards the substance of the peace proposals, Signor Orlando  said :            &quot; The Bolshevist  Commissioner  felt himself  justified in saying that two       points namely (1) the integration of States which have lost their independence       owing to  the war, and (2) withdrawal from invaded territory and renunciation       of annexations had  been accepted.  We shall see that  he is wrong.   But it       is certain that the third  point, regarding  the  regime of people in  subjection       to States  to which  their national conscience does not wish  to  show-  allegiance,       was not accepted by  the Austrians and  Germans, who replied that  questions       such as those of our national, aspirations and of  Alsace-Lorraine ought  not to       be treated from the international point of view, but from the  interior point of       view as regards each country.   That is vicious word, trickery.   It would have       been more simple to reply frankly &apos;No.&apos;  That means  a return to the  status quo,.       which would  be the gravest historical crime, as so vast an upheaval of humanity       cannot  be conceived as not  having any consequences.&quot;        -  ddie speaker  pointed,  out that even a return to the status quo would not be       guaranteed, as the acceptance of the first two  points of the Bolshevist proposals       had clearly been made  in the form of  a trap which must  be  revealed  to  the       peoples in order  that it might  be understood by the whole world.          &quot;ddie  Central  Empires  (fie continued) declare  that they do not mean to       take  away political independence from invaded  peoples.  Do not the. words       &apos; political  independence&apos;  conceal some hidden  reservation as  regards some       other form of independence, as, for example,  economic independence, and why       is no mention made of  the  integrity of  States ?  The  phrase &apos;; independence of       peoples &apos;  is ambiguous  and  justifies every doubt as to the possible reticences of       the  Central  Empires.  Again, wdien they say that they do  not want  violent       annexations of any territory, they leave it to be understood that they aspire to       annexations which are not violent.   When can an annexation  be described as       not violent?  It  will depend on the forms of adhesion torn from peop3es under       the yoke  of invasion, and, moreover, in a more general way perhaps, a  violent       annexation when it has been consecrated in an international treaty might  not       lie considered an annexation.          &quot; All  these  doubts and these  formulas  which entirely  exclude the just       claims  of  the Entente and  admit  the complete predominance  of the  enemy       justify  the hypothesis  that once again we have to deal not  with a sincere       aspiration for peace, but with a form of crafty offensive, the aim of which is to       decompose and poison  the  combatant nations.   .   .  .   Out  of the profound       respect which we feel for the  idea  of  peace  we protest against an attempt to       make of it a crafty means of war.&quot;  -&apos;(Ch(iioro.)o    Signor  Scialoia&apos;s  motion  for  a  vote  of  confidence  in  the Government was unanimously passed.    The Italian Press regards  Count GzernhPs proposals as  an insidious attempt touse Russian revolutionary agents as a means  to  promote a  general  peace, by whichthe Central  Empires would keep all they have gained and give nothing.
    In  a report dated 12th  December Sir  11. Rodd  draws  attention to &quot;a  certainprogramme of peace conditions &quot; commonly reported to have been drawn up  by theofficial Socialist group  in Italy. ,  Its  conditions  are  said  to be  approximately the-following the evacuation by Germany of Belgium and of the occupied  territory inFrance ;  the   restoration to France  of  Alsace-Lorraine with  the exception  of the-mineral basin;  the annexation by Germany of Cpurlaud and Lithuania and of  a smallportion of Russian Do]and, the.remainder of which would  be united  to Austria; theunion  of Armenia with Russia ; a portion of the Trentino and the line of the Jsonzowithout Gorizia to be conceded to Italy ;  the  cession of Iviao Ghao to  -Japan (!), while a conference of States, under the presidency of the United  States, would decide  uponthe fate of the Colonies and the eventual  delimitation of the Balkan States.  Nothinghas been,  suggested regarding Mesopotamia  or Palestine.  The fact  that a definiteprogramme of  such a character is being  circulated  by the Socialists is  significant,and it is  no  doubt  meant to persuade  the  public that some  such, conditions areattainable, and  would under present  conditions  be more advantageous to Italy than she is  entitled  to  hope  for  in return for   the  . prospect  of  an  early  peace.Simultaneously, in  spite of  the  shortage  of  paper and  the cost of labour, threenew publications, the Tempo, the Epo^a, and a Roman edition  of  the  Socialist Avanti all supported by questionable characters are  to appear.  It, is  possible that the aim of  these publications and of the Socialist  proposals is to familiarise the Italianpublic with a  programme which  the  Central Powers  might  be prepared, to  accept,though unwilling to offer.  A, cry for peace  on  these terms would,  be raised with-which  Sigouri Giolitti would identify himself and.  step forward as the saviour of his country.    In a further despatch, dated 22nd  December, Sir R. Rodd reports that he learnsthat, an almost, identical programme was recently  outlined  to the United states ambassador  by Signor Tittoni (who has formerly  served  under Signor Giolitti),  andit seems  possible that  this may  have constituted a similar attempt  by  the CentralEmpires to get  into touch with the President of the United. States through unofficialagents.    ddie New York Times, after observing  that &quot; the  Pan-German  will not stoop toconquer,&quot; quotes the Lokalanzeigei&apos;&apos;s  hint  to the Pan-Germans beginning  with thewords, &quot;The outlines are  drawn wide enough to give scope to the demands of justice.&quot;This hint the New York Times translates: &quot;ddie outlines are drawn wide enousfhfor  a louring ear to drive through.&quot;    In regard to Clause 2  of the German terms which declares.&quot; it is not the Germanintention to deprive of political independence those nations which lost it  during thewar,&quot; the New  York Times asks: &quot;flow will she utilise this  possibility in  later&quot;negotiations?  By  interpreting  it to mean  that  Belgium will not  be &apos; deprived of&quot; political  independence,&apos; but,  will lie economically  and  strategically  annexed to&quot; Germany, with German garrisons stationed  in  her forts, and  will  be  sub-divided&quot; between  Flemings  and  Walloons lo  give (iermany die power of making her  domi-&quot; nation permanent?  By interpreting it to mean  that Poland will not be &apos; deprived&quot; of political independence,&apos; but be entitled to be governed  by a king selected for her&quot; by Ciermany and ruled from Berlin ?  &quot;    Sir 0. Spring Rice reports that the  United  States Government has agreed  to detainall  warlike shipments to Russia,    In a report dated 1.7th December, Sir  W. Townley gives the substance of a  speechdelivered by the Dutch Prime Minister on 28th November :           On  the  subject  of the after war outlook lie first dwelt on  the problem       of a League of Nations, stating that it was an ideal,  cherished  by a large part       of humanity  that  States  should  abandon  their absolute  autonomy;  that       economic expansion should be guaranteed  by consultation ; disputes settled by       arbitration; armies  and. navies reduced   to a minimum an  ideal  that was       continually gathering strength.   There wore, however, enormous difficulties in       the way of  its realization, such, as the definition of  the. relations between States       and peoples, nationalities and races ; the fixing of the limits  separating  self       rule  from  dependency;  the relations between Asia and Europe.  &quot;These      problems must, however, not deter us.  We must spare no effort.&quot;   ddie way       leading  to  a  League  of  Nations  was the only  one  to  a  lasting  peace      and the preservation&apos;of civilization.  The  attainment of  this object was in       conformity with Netherlands traditions and  a matter of  vital  interest to the      Dutch as a small nation.          ddie Prime Minister concluded  by  a vigorous  assertion of the continued      neutrality of Holland.
                                     i   21; .   Sir  M. Fmd.lay.and Sir Id. Howard independently  report,  that the, Swedish Red prose organisatiom.has been negotiating with the Bolshevists with.a view to persuading, them to permit, the  passage of. German prisoners of war. across the  Rpsso-Qerman frontier..  According  to the German  Wireless Rress,  die  Stockholm  Dagblad,. ja  an: article entitled &quot; Obduracy against  thoughts of Peace,&quot; contrasts the Allies&apos;: attitude with that of the Central Powers and the Bolshevists, to the advantage.of the latter. . ,  The  German.  Wireless  Press quotes articles from&apos; the .Basler Anzeiger and. the Lausanne Droll da  J&apos;ewplc.   The former, referring, to  the  Australian- vote on coii- scription, states that &quot;the countries of  the British.Empire are beginning to demur &quot;from  following  the-  mother country.   , ,-.  .   Probably tire will for  peace amongst &quot; the Entente  has received .-more impetus from, this than  from any tiling- else.&quot;  ddie Droll du Beieple remarks, &quot;We can quite understand  that  the  Russian peasant does &quot; not desire to get killed  for Alsace-Lorraine any more than millions  of,.Frenchmen &quot; who demand,peace desire it.&quot;                                      ...    The  Pan-German Press points out with satisfaction  that  either&quot; the Allies must? accept  the formula  of &quot;no annexations,&quot;  with disastrous results  to...the  British Empire, or the German Government will be able,  to  abandon the principle,  and settle the war on the Western Front.  Commenting on this, the German Wireless Press urges the Pan-Germans  to consider the advice of the Pope that Right  should displace Might;-. at the same time the Allies are warned that  German forbearance is not unlimited.   P ;    While peace with Russia is not considered, a certainty, it is  felt that, the  negotia- tions have given a world-wide impetus to the desire for a peace by understanding.    According  to  KoelriisrJie Volkszeitung,  General.  Pudendorff made the  following appeal  to  the Press during  the  visit   of  newspaper  representatives  to Main Headquarters :           &quot; Do  not let us speak too much  about peace since only victory can  lead  to       it.  As it was in the East, so  will it bo everywhere.   Victory and  peace  are       certainly coming, and they will come all. the sooner according  as we are more       united internally and strong in bearing what now has  to be  borne.   From  a       military point of view, nobody can  contest our  victory even, if there are  still       heavy tasks before us.   With. GocPs help) we shall accomplish it.&quot;    In the  course of   a  speech, recently delivered in Berlin,  Dr. Sol 1,  the German Colonial  Secretary,  argued  that &quot; self-determination&quot; as  applied  to Africa would mean the throwing back of the native peoples into terrible  chaos, and  in place of. &quot; self-determination &quot; he claims that the natives must have the  right of being regarded as the &quot; aim. in  itself &quot; of  Colonial activity.   Post-war co-operation by the Powers in Africa must return,  to  the principles  laid down  in.  the Berlin  Congo Act.   Germany will not refuse inter national co-operation in, this sense in Africa.  Gape must be taken by every means to keep away from Africa the militarization of  the natives.  -The best means  to prevent  militarization  is  the  redistribution of the  continent,  which,  by creating a balance of power, would prevent any single Colonial Power from transferring coloured forces to Europe.    The Jewish Correspondence Bureau at  The Hague has received a telegram, from Berlin  stating that  the  German  Zionist   Conference  has  adopted the following- resolution :-&quot; The  German Zionist Association greets with satisfaction the fact that &quot;the British  Government has  recognised in. an  official declaration, the right of the. &quot; Jewish people to a national existence in. Palestine.&quot;    Berlin reports&apos; that on.  the  invitation of the Imperial Chancellor,  the Polish Prime Minister von. Ktieharzewski  lias arrived  in  Berlin, accompanied by  the Chief of  the Political Department,  Count Rostworowski, and the Under State Secretary  at&quot;  the Finance Ministry.  Discussions have taken place in regard to the desires of the Polish Government in connection with the peace negotiations with  Russia.    Sir  P. Howard, learns  that  difficulties between the Bolshevists and. the Germans will arise over the status of Lodz in Poland, probably because the Germans, in order to prevent, competition,  have  carried away nearly all the  more  important  machinery from the factories there.    The Press reports  that Rear-Admiral Kaiser! big and staff has arrived in  Petrograd, and has stated, that  he is  charged with the task of discussing with representatives of the Russian Fleet the  means of putting an end to  naval operations in the  White Sea -for  the  period of the armistice.  A. German Mission, under Count Mirbaeli,  and. an.&apos; Austrian  Mission, tinder. Prince Id.ohenl.ohe, together; with Missions from  Turkey  and Bulgaria, have  also arrived, and will discuss, among  other questions, the-renewal, of -commercial and other relations with Russia and the  exchange  of prisoners  of war.  I-- D,7(uA.i.  ;-;    &apos;&apos;-;;-&apos;&apos;.&apos;-&apos;-&apos;,  ,: &apos;&apos; -      :    b &quot;          &apos;  &apos;:--. &quot;  &apos; -   -&apos;           .;  &apos;
Under - provisions contained in the  armistice, German merchant  vessels have&apos;&apos; ideeaccess to  Russian waters, and it is stated  that  cargoes of  German wares, elderlyclothing, ironware and manufactured goods, are expected next  week in Reval.  It isalso reported that trade with Germany is in full  swing&quot; on the Riga front and hi  themajority of the Baltic provincial towns and has already resulted in a fall  of prices forhoots,  shoes and other manufactured goods.  Soldiers are selling in the streets of petrogard goods bought  by them at Riga;  and  German commercial travellers&apos;areapplying for orders and promising delivery in January.  A regular service of stbalfiefsis stated to have been opened between German ports and Finland via Stockholm&apos;. &apos;  &apos; &apos;  1  According to the  Frankfurter Zeitung,  it is argued that, in  the circumstances,Germany  must be prepared, to  make cash  payments for the raw materials that  shewants, and  it  is held  that  a display of  cash  will  be the best means  of restoringGerman credit, which is admittedly still low in Russia, and also of increasing Russia^.confidence in the policy of the Bolshevists.   A finance conference, consisting of  the eight principal German banks, was recently held in Berlin,  and the Government andthe; bankers are said to be working out the best and most profitable means of enabling-Germany  to make payment in roubles.    The Cologne Gazette says that  one of Germany&apos;s chief objects  must  be to secureall  the debts to Germany which were suspended ,. by  the war.  The journal,  remarks&apos;that, whatever methods may be  adopted for  the  regulation, of commercial relations,&quot;Germany  has the upper hand.  It also sa3^s :           &quot; ddie immense noise which is at present being made on the Thames and       on  the  Seine shows that our economic  settlement with the Russians is feared.       ddiis is shown also by the efforts which are aiming at the disturbance of  peace       negotiations,  and  the Yankees  also  are  finding that the German-Russian       rapprochement  is greatly  upsetting their calculations, which seemed  to them.       so  simple,&quot;    Sir G.  Buchanan reports that  according to the latest returns the Bolshevists havewon IdO and the  Social Revolutionaries 209 seats ;  but it is probable that nearly halfof the latter will side with the Bolshevists and give them a working majority.   In that event the  Germans will probably continue negotiations and  will  also proceed withtheir economic penetration of Russia.    Sir G.  Buchanan also learns that the Bolshevist Commissary at Tornea  has receivedorders to combat British efforts to capture Russian trade; &quot;  ddie Berner Tagblatt announces that the German  100 mark banknote,  which a  few&apos;weeks ago could lie bought  in Switzerland for  59 francs, to-day stands  at 85.  ddieincreased  value of the rouble from 00 to  85 is considered in Switzerland  to be a goodsign of peace.    Berlin reports a  statement by the former Rumanian Foreign  Minister, AlexanderMargiiiioman, to a representative of the Transocean service, in which he expresses  thehope that  Ruraania&apos;s future will  be united in a lasting manner with  that of the CentralPowers.   &quot;  To Russia we cannot chain our fate.   Russia is our natural and economic&quot; competitor.   But also for ethical reasons we are destined for  the  Central Powers as*&apos; far as   general cultural  tendencies  are  concerned.&quot;  lie  asserted that the  army would not resist a change of Government, and that if  the  conditions of such  peaceshould involve the abdication of the  king, then the king would  act accordingly.    The Bolshevist Government,  learning that war prisoners are showing  an increasedtendency  to return  to  their country or  are  going to other places in  the interior ofRussia, has  issued a general appeal  that measures should be taken to prevent theunorganised movement in.masses of  all war prisoners.   &quot; Until  a  special order is&quot;issued,  men of military  age between 17  and 50  are not  to  return to  their country&quot;&apos; except in cases of exchange.&quot;    ddie Foreign Office learns  that  German-speaking  Lettish regiments and  armedGerman prisoners are concentrated in Petrograd, and that there is the probability ofan  unopposed German landing in its neighbourhood.  Such a step would lead to a reaction in  favour  of the Allies and of war, but Russian military strength in  . theNorth has almost disappeared.   It  is possible, however, that an  early  revulsion of;feeling against the Bolshevists may upset the German plan,  :  Sir G. Buchanan himself indicates the possibility that  the enemy will  demand  thatthe Bolshevist Government shall renounce  the Entente and  enter  into alliance withthe Central  Powers.   In this event  the Government  would be incapable of  militaryresistance.
2 e) 5                                   GENERAL.   Regarding the arrangements for  the internment of prisoners of war at The Hague,General  Williams  reported  on  28th December  that,  apart from  the  300  british prisoners who  were expected  on the 29th  December, there should have  arrived atThe Hague between 1st January and the date of the  arrival of the  third transport of germans from England 3,000 British  prisoners.  After the arrival  of the  transportreferred  to, six batches (containing 300 each) of British prisoners will arrive at ddieHague, and these will complete the number.   All the British prisoners referred to arein sound health with, the exception of one batch.   Sir W. Townley reports that the  Syndicate which lias had in hand the question of housing  and  feeding  the British prisoners of war has been informed that it will beresponsible for  a,  War  Profit Tax.  Though payment of this is not necessary until december 1.918, the  Syndicate refused to  permit  the houses to lie  used until, the contracts are signed by the Dutch Government, while the latter will not agree to carry the matter through until, the British Government undertake  to guarantee payment ofthe tax.   Though a deposit of 100,0001. was  first  asked for, it has  now been fixed at,000/., and Sir W. dkiwnley has asked the British. Government if he may inform theDutch Foreign Minister that this amount wdll be guaranteed.   ddie  German  Wireless  Press  reports  the  conclusion  of the  German-Frenchnegotiations  carried on at Berne concerning war  prisoners.  In the course of these, &apos;it  is asserted that France  insisted that the  exchange  and internment of healthy warprisoners should be in proportion to  the  number of prisoners, and that Germany inconsequence would have  to return about twice  as many poisoners as France.  Forthis  reason,  it  is  stated., &quot; the  far-reaching  German proposals fell through,&quot; and inconsequence about 60,000 men, including some  20,000 fathers of families, were to beliberated.  &quot;Thus,&quot; it is  alleged, &quot;through  France&apos;s fault a great  humane work hasbroken down.&quot;   A circular of 26th &quot;December signed  by Lenin and  others  and addressed &quot; to allgenerally and  to  the  whole of labouring  Cossackdom,&quot; cancels obligatory military.service  by Cossacks,  substitutes  short  training&apos;,  and takes over, on account of theState, the equipment  and armament  of  Cossacks at present called up for militaryservice.   A circular of the same date and origin addressed  to &quot;All Comrades, the Workmen&apos;of Russia,&quot; after stating that the  armistice  &quot;  will probably  result  in  a generaldemocratic peace,&quot;  says, &quot;It  is clear that at the present  time  the manufacture  of&quot; munitions would be  a useless wastage  of the people&apos;s  labour  and fortunes, and so,&quot; Comrades, it is necessary  to stop immediately the further production of such goods&apos;&quot; and start the manufacture of articles of first necessity.&quot;
