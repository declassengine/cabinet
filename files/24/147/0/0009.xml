SECRET.APPRECIATION  OF  TILE  ATTACHED  WESTERN&apos;  AND  GENERAL                           REPORT,  No.  34.                            INTER-IMPERIAL EXCHANGE.   The absence of  any financial  unity in the British Empire, repeatedly dwelt on inthese appreciations, is  the first point emphasised  by Lord Reading on  his arrival inAmerica.   As things stand, the wool and jute which Australia and  India send to theUnited  Stares  are, apparently, not available to  create  credits to  set  off againstAmerican advances to the British Government,  How far the problem, can be solved bytemporary expedients on existing lines, or how far the situation would be eased by thecreation of a common medium of  exchange within the Empire, in wdiich Australia andIndia could be repaid,  by the British Government  for the goods sent to America, is aquestion  for the  financial experts.  But, short of  something  in  the  nature  of  an imperial Financial Conference, it is not easy to see how&apos; a problem of such complexitycan be satisfactorily dealt with.                                    FRANCE.   The new French War Committee is evidently closely  modelled on the British WarCabinet, four of its eight members being  Ministers without portfolio.  The british war Cabinet organisation has, for some  time past, been the subject of careful studyby more than one competent  observer  deputed to  this task by M. Ribot.   Meanwhilein the Chamber itself  M. Painleve has not had too encouraging  a  reception, and hasan uphill task before him.                                     GREECE.    The  friction between Greece and Italy over Epirus is subsiding.   There are evenindications of a tendency on the  part of Greece, under the new regime, as under theold, to  look  to  Italy to counterbalance  French   pretensions to  too  exclusive  apredominance in Greek affairs.                                  NETHERLANDS.    The  &quot;pull devil  pull baker&quot; between the Allies and Germany for the  economiccontrol of Holland is reaching an  acute stage.  In matters of commerce the misfortuneof the Dutch,  judging by the plaintive tone of the Queeids speech, is  that from  bothsides they are given too little and asked for too much.
21                                    SWEDEN.   The effect of the recent  exposures upon the Swedish elections seems to have beenall that could be desired.  The odious character of  the messages  themselves;&apos;arid thevery inadequate German expression  of regret  to Sweden  for the conduct of CountLux burg, have paralysed even the stoutest pro-Germans in  the Swedish Press.                                PEACE DISCUSSIONS.   Judging by the agitation in the Pan-German Press, it is probable that, the forth-coming reply of the Central Powers to the Papal Note will  make  more or less explicitsuggestions about Belgium,  and will be  a definite  attempt to create a basis  fordiscussion.  No  doubt its  issue will be timed to coincide,  if  possible,,  with  somedramatic military effect, e.g., an advance in, force into  Moldavia  and Bessarabia andthe attack on Bagdad.20th&apos; September 1917.L.

PART  I.-BRITISH  EMPIRE  AND  AFRICA.                            IMPERIAL AFFAIRS.   The Colonial Office has communicated to the several sell-governing Dominions the text  of  the  agreement signed between  His  Majesty&apos;s  Government and the UnitedStates Government with regard to purchases of supplies in the United States and theestablishment of an Inter-Allied Council for that purpose in London.  The Secretaryof State for the Colonies desires  to  be  informed whether the  Governments of theDominions have any objection  to the  application  of the Imperial Governmentsagreement to any purchases which the Dominions may desire to  make in the UnitedStates involving the provision of  credits in that country.   It would  appear that theUnited  States  Government expect that  the  requirements on which purchases forBritish  Overseas Governments  are based, should  be  endorsed  by the  Inter-allied council, before being presented  to  the American  Commission functioning underthe agreement.                                   CANADA.   The third reading of the War Time Elections Bill was carried, under the closure,by a straight party majority, only four Liberals voting with  the Government.  In the concluding debate Sir G. Foster said it was the Governments policy to  give votes toall women after the war, but that under present  conditions  that was impossible, andthe immediate  situation  was therefore  best  met by  giving  the  vote to the femalenext  of  kin of  soldiers  serving  oversea.   Men of alien enemy birth  could notcomplain if they were disfranchised for the period of the war, inasmuch as they were also exempted from service at the front.    Confessions made to the police  by one Joseph Tremblay, arrested  in connectionwith  the attempt to blow up Lord  AtholstaiFs house,  indicate the existence of an extensive plot to blow up Sir R. Borden, Sir J. Flavelle, and a  number of other leading-public men.    As  the  result of the representations of the Wheat  Export  Commission, theCanadian Minister of Finance and the Canadian  Banks  recognise that a loan will benecessary to finance the wheat crop to the seaboard, but  they do not see their way to carrying the grain further than the coast.  A meeting of the Banking  Association isdiscussing  the matter this week.    The Dominion Board of Grain Supervisors have fixed the prices of the new  wheatcrop  on a basis uniform  with that  recently   established  by  the United  StatesGovernment.    The revenue of the Dominion for the last five months  of the fiscal year ending31st August amounted to  $112,000,000. During the same period war expenditure within  the  Dominion came to  $57,000,000, and  ordinary  expenditure  (includinginterest&apos; on war  loans) was  $43,000,000.    The  revenue  was  therefore  more thansufficient to cover all expenditure within the Dominion.    The  Dominion  Government  on  8th  September issued an  Order in Councilprohibiting the exportation to Norway,  Sweden,  Denmark and Holland of  all articleswhose export to these countries was  prohibited by the United States proclamation of27th August.                      AUSTRALIAN  COMMON WEALTH:   With further reference  to the question of the organisation  of the  Australianfighting formations (vide Report No. 31), the Secretary of State for the Colonies has
informed  the Commonwealth Government  that  the  Army Council must leave the grouping of divisions in the field to the discretion of the Commander-in-Chief.  Whilesympathising with  the desire of  the Commonwealth Government to have the fiveAustralian Divisions grouped in one Corps, the Army Council point out that, both for adminsitrative and tactical purposes, such a  Corps would be unwieldy.  The present arrangement whereby the five Australian Divisions and one New Zealand Division are organised in two Corps affords, in their opinion, the simplest and most effective meansof giving effect to the wishes of the Australian Government.   As regards the  question of  Staff Officers, the Army Council observe that theprinciple of interchange between Australian  and British officers has not been observed in the past because of the lack of Australian officers with the necessary training and experience.   It is expected, however, that for the future there should he little difficultyin providing a representative proportion of Australian officers for Staff appointments,both inside  and outside the Australian Imperial Force.  The  Army Council considerit essential that the Imperial character of the Staff be maintained, and that, to thisend,  British  officers  should  serve on  the  staffs  of  Dominion  formations, and vice versa.   The final figures, now published, of  the  voting  of the Australian soldiers overseaon the question of compulsory service were : For, 72,399 ; against, 58,894.                                SOUTH AFRICA.   Replying to the  enquiries  of  the Union Government  (vide  last  Report) theSecretary of State for the Colonies  has stated that, beyond a  promise to Japan of43,000 bales of Australian wool for Government use, no definite arrangements havebeen made between the  British and  Japanese Governments.   It is believed that thequantity of wool actually purchased by Japanese  buyers up to  the  present in SouthAfrica and  South America is  more  than is  required for the  purposes of Japanesemanufacturers, and  that these  purchases are  therefore  speculative.   Generallyspeaking, and bearing in  mind the fact that Japan does not require wool for war purposes as the Allies require it, her  position is as favourable as that  of  any of the belligerent nations.   As regards the United States, there  remain to be supplied tothat country,  under  unfulfilled arrangements, 50,000  bales of Australian wool for civilian purposes and 8,000,000 lbs. for naval uniforms, but His Majesty&apos;s Governmentare pledged to give  most favourable consideration to their  wool requirements formilitary purposes.   The Portuguese Minister for Foreign Affairs has informed  Sir L. Carnegie thatthe reason why Maritz and his companions were transferred  from Africa to Lisbonwas that they were suspected of relations with rebellious natives.   Some  of  them have asked  for permission to go to Holland, and  the Portuguese Government wish toknow what view the British Government take of the matter.                                  RHODESIA.    There is evidence of considerable opposition to the proposal to place Northern and southern Rhodesia under one administrator, unless and  until the  matter is referred tothe people of both territories.   Mr. Coghlan, on behalf of the elected members of theGovernment, who voted against amalgamation, has addressed a letter on the subjectto the High Commissioner.  He points out that administrative union  is likely to leadto  undesirable consequences, administrative, political, and financial; that  were iteffected, it would, be impossible for the elected members to prevent the British SouthAfrica Company from exploiting the revenues and the services of officials in SouthernRhodesia to the detriment of that territory.  lie maintains that a constitutional changeof the kind suggested cannot be carried out without  reference to  the  wishes  of those concerned.   Should  the people not be consulted,  and  should steps be  taken  toestablish  the  proposed  administrative  union, it might become quite  impossible  tomaintain co-operation between the -people&apos;s representatives and the Company.
                           BRITISH  EAST AFRICA.   The Government of the East Africa  Protectorate have offered to undertake the care and maintenance  of military graves within  the  territory of the Protectorate.  Thisproposal will  be  submitted to the Imperial War Graves  Commission, but for  thepresent it is considered that, under existing conditions, it  is desirable that the workof marking and maintaining graves should be performed  by the Graves RegistrationUnit, recently established by the War Office.   With  reference to the proposed employment of a detachment of the 1/6 th  Iving&apos;sAfrican Rifles (ex-German Askaris) in the Turkana country  on  the Abyssinian  border(see  Report No. 32, p. 5),  the officer  administering the East Africa  Protectorateproposes to employ only 200 for this purpose, in accordance  with  the advice  of  the commandant of the King&apos;s African Rifles, and in view of  the fact that co-operation from the Sudan is in any case  required  for dealing with the Turkana.  The  sudan government  have already promised the assistance  of  a  force of 200  rifles, somemounted infantry; and two machine guns.  The rest of the 1/Gth Battalion Mr. Monsonproposes to use on the Juba River,  in view of the  CommandanPs opinion that thereis no danger of the men being affected  by Somali intrigues.   The proportion of british officers and non-commissioned  officers with the battalion will be kept, as far as possible,at full strength.                        SOM AXIL AND PROTECTORATE.    Mr. Archer, Commissioner of the Somahland Protectorate, has  secured  from the Somali Chiefs a guarantee to sell 5,000 camels  on  condition of a road  being con-, structed from Berbera to  Burao.   The Chiefs have also offered an additional 1,000 camels as a free  gift to His Majesty&apos;s Government.   Mr. Archer  is  accepting  this offer, and strongly urges the building of the road, the chief difficulty with  regard to which is the securing of the necessary labour.   Egyptian labour not being  available, Mr. Archer suggests the possibility of securing labourers from Assam.                        PORTUGUESE  EAST AFRICA.   The Governor of Nyasaland reported on 13th September that the local Portugueseofficials had received satisfactory instructions from Lorenzo Marques, as the result  ofwhich the recruiting of carriers for service in German East Africa was making good progress.                                   LIBERIA.   The Liberian  Government have  offered to  sell to the Governments  of GreatBritain, France and the United States all the German-owned stocks of palm kernels and oil, in Liberia, so as to prevent all  possibility of such produce reaching the enemythrough the agency of local (e.g., Spanish) traders.3897-3B
PART  II.-FOREIGN  AFFAIRS.                              ALLIED  AFFAIRS.   The Russian  Minister for Foreign Affairs on  14th  September informed Sir G.Buchanan that the Russian Government were anxious that the  proposed Conferenceof Allies  should  not discuss the conditions of  peace or the  revision  of  existing agreements, but the conditions of the war and the general situation.   The French Government have decided  to co-operate in the proposed  embargo  on goods for Scandinavia and the Netherlands provided that the Allies  can do withoutthe exports from these countries, and  have asked for a Conference at an early datebetween the French and British Ministers  of Blockade and  a  representative of theUnited States  to  adjust the details.  In connection with this  M. met in, the UnderSecretary for Blockade in the new  French  Administration,  has  already  arrived inLondon.FRANCE.   The new  French Administration  which, camecomposed as follows : -      President of the Council and Minister for         War   &apos;           Under Secretaries :              for Health   -             for Aeronautics             for General Administration  -             for Military Justice, Litigation, and              Pensions             for Inventions     -         -     -      Minister for Foreign Affairs      Minister of Justice  -      Minister of the Interior           Under Secretary -      Minister of Public Instruction      Minister of Marine      Minister of Public Works           Under Secretary for Fine Arts      Minister of Agriculture      Minister of Labour      Minister of Eavitaillement      Minister of Commerce           Under Secretaries :              for Commerce             for Merchant Marine and Maritime              Transport             for Blockade -      Minister of the Colonies      Minister of Armaments      Minister of Finance           Under Secretary of Finance      Minister of Propaganda      Ministers  (Secretaries  of  State  without         Portfolios)       -into  office on  12th  September isM.

Lord  Bertie understands  that  the  War Committee,  which will sit  under the presidency of President Poincare, is  composed of the Prime Minister (Minister forWar) and MM. Ribot  (Foreign  Affairs),  Chaumet (Marine), Loucheur  (Armament),
Bourgeois, Doumer, Barthou, and Jean Dupuy, witli the  assistance of the  Militaryand Naval Chiefs of Staff, in a consultative capacity^ and of the Minister of Finance,when required.    M. Painleve  has made  a  Ministerial  Declaration, in which  the  recovery of alsace-Lorraine and the exaction of  reparation for damage done by enemy are laidclown as the French war aims.   The Declaration,  according to Lord Bertie, arousedno great enthusiasm in the Chamber.    Another scandal is feared in France.  The deputy Tunnel  is suspected  of  havingsold to the Germans details about the secret session of the French Chamber in june last.  25,000 francs in Swiss paper money was found in his locker in  the cloakroom ofthe Chamber  and while attempting  to reach Switzerland in order, as he  said, toobtain evidence  to clear his character, he was  turned back at the frontier and. refusedpermission to leave France.    Lord Bertie  understands  that Tunnel is connected with the  Duval cheque in theAffaire of the  Bonnet Rouge, and  the  suspicious  transactions of a  firm in a neutral country for forwarding cattle into Germany.   The Ambassador  reports that a Corn-mission of the Chamber will examine the accused Deputy on 20th September to decide whether or no to grant the  application for suspension of privilege in his case made bythe Procureur General.                                    ITALY.    Sir  R. R:odd had a conversation  on 3rd September with  Signor Bissolati on thereturn of the latter  from the Italian front.  The Ambassador gathered that  the PapalPeace Proposals had done no harm in the Army, where the spirit was magnificent;  onthe contrary, the reason for their publication at the moment  of the biggest Italianoffensive was fully understood, and. even Catholics  were indignant at  the action of the pope.   Signor Bissolati,  referring to  the possibility of  internal trouble advocated a firm policy.  (This may be compared with the Foreign Minister&apos;s declaration referredto on  page 8 of Report No. 33.)    The  mission of  Lord Derby to the Italian front  was warmly welcomed,  and theSecretary of  State  for War had an audience of the  King of  Italy,  and  a longconversation   with   General  Cadorna.   Lord  Derby visited  the Carso front,  and returned  by  way of Venice, after  exchanging cordial  telegrams with the  ItalianCommander-in-Chief from  the frontier.    In view of the Italian representations as to the  imminence  of revolution in Sicilyif the orange crops should  not be sold, His Majesty&apos;H Government  have decided toproceed  with  the scheme  for  purchase proposed by Sir  R.  Rodd,  up to  a total ofl,O00,00OL, but insist upon the immediate  and  effective prohibition  of  export oflemons  and lemon-jthce.  Purchases have begun.    The  Ambassador learns  that the grain  question is now  serious in Italy, as theMinister for War has had to draw  on Army  stocks  to supply the needs of the civilpopulation, and  considers  that  this  must  be taken into account in calculating theresisting power  of the Italians.    On 19th September martial law was extended to the provinces of Turin, Alessandria,and Genoa.                                   GREECE.    The  Italian  evacuation of Epirus  enabled the  Greeks  to re-occupy Parga on10th  September, and  Metzovo on 12th September.  Mr.  Crackanthorpe  has  beeninformed that the Hellenic Government has objected to the proposed establishment of italian  Vice-Consulates at Samarina,  Metzovo, Paramythia,  and Margariti,  as thepresence  of Italians in those particular districts might tend  to tmdermine Greekauthority.    Martial law has been extended  to  the nomarchy of Messenia, the great centre ofGerman influence in the Peloponnese, as from 8th  September.    A mixed  Anglo-French and Greek  Commission has reported on the  munitionsrequired  by the Greek Army, and has  apportioned their supply between France andGreat Britain.  The Foreign Office, however, has had to approach, the United states on  behalf of  the Commission to  supply certain munitions and foodstuffs, which cannotbe  obtained  in Europe, to  a total  value&apos; of 80,000,000 francs,  and is urging the favourable consideration of the Greek request for a loan upon the Government, a taskin which the co-operation of France has been invited.
I8   Mr. Crackanthorpe reports that the French Military Mission, which is to consist ofsome 80 French officers, will he ready to get to work on the training of  the HellenicArmy in October.   General Braquet expects to be able to arrange for 10 divisions ofthe Greek Army to be ready early next year.   In view of the numerous facilities which exist in Greece for smuggling, the ForeignOffice has asked the French Government to concur in the maintenance of the navicertsystem  in connection with the shipment of  United  States  exports to Greece, and inthe appointment of a Greek Delegate on the Allied Board at the Pi rams as a concession to Hellenic sentiment.                                    SERBIA.    On returning to the temporary seat of part of the  Serbian Government at Corfu,M. Pashitch  has  sent a telegram reporting that the moral of the Serbian troops  hasbeen increased by the news of  his reception in  England, and of the manifestationsof British  sympathy with Serbia, for all of which the Serbian Prime Minister againexpresses his gratitude.                              GERMAN  AFFAIRS.    Sir  W. Townley reports that Duke Johann Albrecht of Mecklenburg and GrandAdmiral von Tirpitz have circularised the German nation  to the effect that they have accepted the leadership  of the &quot; German Patriotic Party.&quot;    According to a German Press report, the Saxon Diet  has rejected a proposal forthe reform of the electoral law.    The &quot; Germania&quot; has been permitted by the Censorship to draw attention to theincrease in the cost of the production of raw sugar, and  to the  expected shortage ofbeets this winter in explanation of the advance in the price of sugar.    The  &quot;Vorwarts&quot; criticises the  Pan-German enthusiasm of  the Lignite IndustryUnion, which it says has clone so well out of the war as to be naturally most indignantwith people who whine about peace.    The  &quot; Vorwarts&quot;  quotes  the KaiseFs  telegram  of August 1905  to the Tsar(urging him  to secure the support of the Duma in making peace with Japan) againstthe Pan-Germans, of 1917  who oppose a peace  by negotiation  on the lines  of  theresolution of the  Reichstag,  and  hints that that body should insist on  making itswashes heard.                            &quot;   NETHERLANDS.    The  new session of  the  States-General  of the Netherlands  was opened  on 18thSeptember.   The  Speech  from  the Throne, wdiich,  apart from  references  to  thedifficulty in  securing a supply of food and coal and  in communicating with  theColonies, was colourless, wras  read  by the  Prime Minister  in  the  absence  of her majesty the Queen.    The  Foreign Office advises  Sir 0. Spring Rice that Great Britain can  no  longerafford her extensive purchases of Dutch fish for the purpose of  diverting  the supply from Germany and proposes to restrict Dutch fishing  by Naval action, but hopes thatthe United States will  make the grant of  supplies to Holland  conditional upon  thetotal cessation of the export of fish and shell fish to the Central Empires.    The fishing interest  has been notified that no further British coal is available forfishing boats while the present  facilities  exist  for  the export  of Dutch  fish toGermany.    The  explanation furnished by the Dutch Government in reply to the demand ofthe Foreign  Office (referred to  in Report No. 33 page 11) with regard to the  passageof sand and  gravel through Dutch waters is unsatisfactory as  Sir W. Townley pointsout that there has been  no  cessation  of this traffic in spite of the assurances given bythe Minister for Foreign Affairs.   In consequence of this, the British Government has intimated that all facilities&apos; for  the transmission  of Dutch  cable  messages will be withdrawn unless a definite assurance be furnished by the Netherlands government without delay that the  sand  and gravel traffic and the transit of metals into germany or German occupied territory will cease immediately and completely.    Sir W. Townley understands  that Germany is negotiating with  the netherlands government for the purchase of meat in large quantities, half the price to be paid in
-coal and half in credit.   The Dutch desire cash instead of credit, but Sir W. Townleypoints out  that  Kuhlmann who  now directs  German  Foreign policy knows thatunlimited pressure may be applied  to the  Dated with impunity (vide page 11 of report No.  33).    Sir W.  Townley  learns that  the position  of &quot;the friendly Minister of Finance,Mr.  Treub, is endangered by the  fresh German loan proposals.   The finance minister is opposed to the granting of a loan to  Germany, but great pressure is being-brought  to bear on  the  Netherlands Government.   The most recent terms  suggestedare that  Germany should supply a much needed 350,000 tons of coal per month (at36 florins per ton) for three months on condition that Holland gives  a  monthly loan-of at least 16,000,000 florins (approximately 1,400,000Z.).  If these credits are giventhe Dutch requirements of iron, steel, cement, and.salt will be  guaranteed.   Sir  W.Townley suggests that if 100,000 tons of British coal were to be  sent immediately -on account of future deliveries  under  the  new proposals Mr. Treub&apos;s position wouldbe strengthened.   In reply to this suggestion the Foreign Office has agreed to secure100,000  tons of coal for  Holland if the Dutch fetch it, and has offered to black  listDutch banks lending money or giving credits to Germany.    One form of German pressure is reported by Sir&apos; W. Townley to be a demand thatHolland  should pay gold at  the nominal rate of exchange, viz., 60 cents to the  markinstead of the quoted rate of 32,  for  all  German  coal, salt, cement, steel, or  other materials imported from  Germany.  The Dutch Government is  much exercised atthe possibility of having to accept the German terms when the British offers are  muchmore favourable,  and are anxious that the Press  should not hear  of this.    In view of the danger that Germany&apos;- may get too strong an economic grip on  theNetherlands during  the  war  His Britannic Majesty&apos;s  Minister  took occasion  to deliver a warning as  to the possibility that Holland  might, in  that  case, have  to beincluded in the after  the war  trade war.  This  greatly impressed the Dutch Ministerfor Foreign Affairs.    The Foreign Office has become alarmed at the amount of: smuggling from Hollandinto Germany and proposes to refuse facilities for the  import  of tobacco into  theNetherlands until the smuggling be effectively stopped.    The  Dutch Minister for  Foreign Affairs has declined to permit  the NetherlandsMinister in Stockholm to take  part- in any conference of Neutrals.                                 SWITZERLAND.    The  Foreign Office has urged upon the United States Government the desirability-of permitting the import of oil cake into  Switzerland  as the supply of tinned  milk forthe Allied  Armies depends upon the proper feeding of Swiss cattle, but unexpecteddifficulties have arisen,  as  owing to a shortage  of  fertilisers  in  the United States  oneof  the  principal ingredients  of  oil cake cotton-seed meal is being  used as  a substitute.  Sir C. Spring face is informed that the Exports  Board do not  wish tolicense exports of this commodity until the new cotton-seed crop comes into  use,  buthe hopes to be able to,secure  the  release of 6,000 tons already bought by the Swiss.    Sir IL Rum bold, in  reply to Foreign Office  inquiries, states  that  the Swiss stocksof  oil-cake  are veiy  low, and.  that failure  to  obtain  supply asked  for will lead toincrease in export of cattle to  Germany, and decrease in supply of condensed  milk forthe British Army.    Sir  11.  Rumbold has  been informed that, provided,  the  total amount of  theloan to Great Britain and France  is  equal to that accorded to  Germany,  the, divisionas  between the two Allies is immaterial.    In return for this concession it is  possible that the United States may press for the stoppage of exports into Germany of leather, condensed milk, cheese and aluminium.    The Swiss Government has denounced the Silk Agreement of 9th August, as theAgreement of 4th September has not yet been  accepted, by France and Italy.  LordBertie understands that the latter will accept if the seat of the  purchasing bureau be.at Milan, and to this the French are expected to agree.  The Foreign Office is urging the Italian Government to ratify the  agreement without further  delay.    In view of the imposition of the United States embargo upon all goods for  Sweden,.-Sir PI. Rumbold suggests that a  similar policy should be adopted with regard to-Swiss goods  for transit through . Germany to  Sweden.   His  Britannic MajestyS Minister points out that this right of  transit  is the result of a  concession on the  part--of  the Allies to Switzerland, and not  to Sweden.      3897-3                              O
   The Foreign  Office animadverts upon the evasive attitude  of the Swiss  Government in the matter  of  equality of treatment of  the rival groups of belligerents andinstructs  Sir Ff. Rumbold to  inform the Swiss  Government that if there be anyfurther delay in establishing a proper supervision over the exports of war material to-Germany  no further benevolence during the coming winter need be looked for by the swiss from London.                                   SWEDEN.    One result of the recent diplomatic exposure is that Mr. Everlof, the Foreign Office official responsible for the transmission of German telegrams, has been removed from that employment and appointed to another department, but Sir E. Howard under- stands that the King gave audience  to  all pai^ leaders including  Mr. Branting  on 11th  September, and impressed  upon  them  the  necessity  for  commenting  very cautiously on this  incident.   The  Swedish Press,  however, characterises as meagre and unsatisfactory the bald apology offered by Germany to  the Swedish Government for the &quot;inconvenience &quot; caused by the Buenos Airesiaffair.   Part  of the Swedish Press  insists  that  certain telegrams sent  by the  Swedish Minister in Constantinople  on behalf of the American Ambassador, were equally in cypher with those  sent for  Count  Luxburg from Buenos Aires.  In consequence of this, Sir E. Howard urged the necessity for the publication of an official dementi  on this point by the United States Government, and  a  statement  has been published in which it is pointed  out that,  while certain  messages had been transmitted in cypher from  the  Swedish  Legation  in  Constantinople  on  behalf  of  the  United States Ambassador, the Swedish Minister  was,  at the time, in possession  of the American cypher-book.    Referring to  the  publication of the  letter of the German Charge d&apos;Affaires in Mexico Sir E. Howard reports that Swedish public opinion is somewhat exasperated at the way in which Swedish diplomatists  have allowed  themselves  to be made the tool of German intrigues, and learns that ihe Swedish Minister in Buenos  Aires is to- be given six months&apos; leave.   His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Minister, however,  deprecates further  British  Press criticism of  the affair  as  this is beginning to excite Swedish resentment.   In commenting on the Swedish  elections Sir E. Howard  refers to the  ministeriallosses,  and understands that the resignation  of  the Conservative Cabinet  which is generally expected at THE close of the  elections will be followed by the formation of a Li beral Aclmini strati on.   Sir C. Spring Rice recently discussed  the Swedish situation with the United StatesExport Board  and was informed that the Swedish  Government had  stated that  the stoppage of the  export of iron ore  to  Germany could not be considered  and that acomplete cessation of  imports from the United States was preferable.  The ExportsBoard was unwilling to press the blockade question  at this juncture thinking that the diplomatic exposure was the more likely  of the two to affect the  elections favourablyfor the Allies.   Sir E. Howard  quotes  the Swedish Press  as to  the  tremendous  growth  of smuggling offences in Malmo, Landskrona and Helsingborg, where 1,300  summonsesHAAre been already issued in 1917, against a total of  some 300 for 1916.                                   NORWAY.    In view of the possible further co-operation of the United States  in the blockade of Norway which, has been  invited by His Majesty&apos;s Government in  order  to secure-the complete stoppage  of all exports  from Norway to Germany, the Foreign Officeproposes to denounce a number of tenqDorary agreements  referring  chiefly to food-stuffs,  fodders,  paper,  motor cars and  soap.  Sir C. Spring Rice advises that the-Unitecl  States  Authorities entirely acquiesce  in the  necessity for  effecting  suchstoppage of exports.    With regard to  the  proposed French co-operation in the embargo on goods forScandinavia  and  Holland,  the  French Minister in  Christiania has  advised hisGovernment that the Scandinavian countries are contemplating close  union to supply
each others needs, and thus free themselves from the necessity of trading with eithergroup of belligerents.   Under certain conditions the Foreign Office  has agreed with Sir M.  Findlay&apos;proposal that  Norway be  asked to  prohibit exports to  the  Netherlands  unlessconsigned to and  accepted by the Netherland Oversea  Trust, and has instructed himto act accordingly.  (Vide Report No. 33, p.  13.)   In view of the prohibition of the export of wool issued by the Norwegian Govern-ment, the Foreign Office  has notified  Sir M.- Findlay  that  the existing embargo onwool for Norway has been raised.   The Foreign  Office on 12th September instructed  Sir M. Findlay to inform  theNorwegian Government verbally that the Allies and  the United  States are preparedto meet Norwegian Wheat  requirements, estimated at 300,000 tons per annum, out ofthe ostensible surplus  of the  North American crop, provided that  the  pendingnegotiations  with Norway  respecting Norwegian trade with  Germany are settledsatisfactorily&apos; to the Allies.   It is,  however, pointed out  for  the  guidance  of His  Majesty&apos;s Minister  thatas the  Allied wheat requirements  are greater than  the North American surplus,arrangements are being made for the purchase of the Argentine crop  to make up  the deficit.   Should this be carried  through, the Allies will  get North and South Americanwheat with its short sea transit, while the neutrals  will be permitted to  draw theirwheat  from  Australia.   Sir  C. Spring Rice reports that the  United States wheat commission particularly wishes to avoid being called upon  to divert any part of  theNorth  American wheat to neutrals, and is  anxious  that these should be warned assoon as possible  after the Argentine  purchase is completed,  about fetching  theirwheat from Australia as the return voyage takes four months.                                  DENMARK.   Mr. Dunn informs the Ministry of Food that the Danish Authorities  have warnedhim that unless the import  of fodders is permitted there will be no bacon and verylittle butter for export  at the end of this year.   Until  then the Danes propose to divide their exports of these foodstuffs equally between Germany and Great  Britain,and also allot to Germany  and  Great Britain up to 2,000 head  of cattle apiece  perweek.   Mr.  Gurney  reports that in the  present conditions the export of  Danish baconmust cease in about  ten weeks&apos; time, but if the maintenance of the supply be  con-sidered  essential, and the importation of  a limited amount of maize authorised, enough of the present stock of pigs could  be  preserved,  to  ensure the continuance of  the bacon supply  to  the United Kingdom.   The  supply could be regulated in  an exactproportion to the maize imported under  the proposed authorisation, but  an immediate decision is required.  . The Foreign Office is considering  this question,  but  has informed Mr. Gurney that  it can only  entertain  the  proposal on condition  that  nobacon be sent to Germany at the same time.   Difficulties have arisen with regard to tbe British action in requesting the UnitedStates to make the export of mineral oil into Denmark conditional upon the  completecessation of the supply of Danish fish to Germany, as Mr. Gurney points out that  thisconflicts with an  existing Anglo-Danish  Agreement and, if the prohibition comes intoeffect, it may counteract the result of the British propaganda in Denmark.                                  PORTUGAL.    According to Sir L. Carnegie the general strike in Lisbon came to  an end on the morning of 12th September,  whereupon the newspapers  began to reappear.  Thejpostal strike lasted  until 15th September.                                     CHINA.    The French Government have  requested China to  send 20,000  Chinese  troops toFrance for engineering duties, and  the request has been supported by the  JapaneseMinister in Peking.
    The Foreign Office has approached the Chinese Government to learn whether the latter would be prepared to hand  over for  internment in  British territory enemy - subjects capable of military service who  have  no good claim to be repatriated.                                     JAPAN.    Owing to the temporary diversion of labour in British  shipbuilding yards from work on battle cruisers to the preparation of smaller warships and cargo vessels, the Admiralty is anxious to purchase two Japanese battle cruisers in order to maintain our position with regard to  that arm in comparison with the enemy, and Sir C. Greene has been instructed to sound the Japanese Government on this point.    With reference to the rumours that have been in circulation about the employment of Japanese troops in  France, Lord  Bertie  telegraphs that, while he  is assured  that France would welcome such  assistance, he cannot find any trustworthy grounds for believing that Japan would be willing to furnish the troops.    In view of,the unwillingness of the Japanese to  use their proposed share of the ex-enemy  ships in  China in Allied tr-ade,  Sir C. Spring Rice suggests that Japan might still be induced to agree so to employ her proposed share of the ex-enemy  ships in Si am.    The export  of gold  and silver coin and bullion from Japan has been prohibited by Ordinances, dated 12th  and 6th September respectively, but Sir C.  Greene  expects that licences to export will be obtainable, and that this is a measure directed against Chinese  speculators.  His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Minister understands that the export of coal from Japan may shortly be prohibited.                                 ARGENTINA.    On 12th September the German Minister was given his passports, but, according to Press reports, Count Luxburg had not left; Buenos Aires by 19th September, and he is supposed to be awaiting a safe-conduct on board a Spanish ship.    Sir C. Spring Rice  understands that the  new bunker regulations about to be put in force by the  United States will compel  neutrals sailing for the River Plate and other South American  destinations to load return cargoes for United States ports, and expects this will discourage neutral purchases of Argentine wheat.                                   MEXICO.    Mr. Cummins has received from a confidential source, information, as yet uncon- firmed, that the Germans have  come to an  arrangement with Pelaez  to destroy the oil-wells in October or  November  and to  declare that Mexico sides  wdth Germany. This information has been communicated lo the State Department in Washington, but Sir  C. Spring Rice thinks that Pelaez, who is reported to be anti-German, stands to lose too much by such action.    Mr. Cummins learns that the Belgian Government is on the point  of recognizing General  Carranza.   He suggests that as  the downfall of that personage is by no means improbable, the Belgian  and French Governments may see lit to defer any recognition for the time being.    The Italian  Minister has been directed by  his Government to present  his letters of credence as Minister, but  has received  no instructions as to the  recognizing of General  Carranza.    It appears that an unsuccessful attempt to  assassinate General Carranza was  made on 12th September.                                   PANAMA.    Sir C. Mallet reports that the ex-German Consul at Colon  has been interned.    The  Foreign  Office  informs Sir C. Spring  Rice that  the local  United States authorities in Panama appear to hope -that the British demands for facilities in the Canal may lead to a types^ourable opportunity for the abrogation of the Hay-PauncefoteTreaty.
URUGUAY.   The Italian Government  object  to  the  terms of the proposed Arbitration Treaty&quot;with Uruguay which Great Britain and  France are prepared to accept on the groundthat it  contains provisions  which are  not  included in  the Arbitration  Treaties  inexistence  between Italy  and  other  South American  Republics,  and that the Italianinterests affected are very much larger than those of France,  ddie Foreign Office,  inview of the question of the ex-German ships and the Uruguayan  determination to getthe Arbitration Treaties as a price for their employment in Allied interests, is  anxious that Italy  should concede the disputed point, and Sir R. Rodd has been informed byBaron Sonnino that he is prepared to meet the demands of the Republic to the extentof agreeing to cases being in the first  instance submitted to the Uruguayan Courts,the right to arbitration being maintained in  reserve.   Mr. Mitchell Inn.es does not think the Republic will consent to use the ships in the exclusive interest of the Allies, and the Brazilian Ambassador in Washington has toldSir C. Spring Rice that Uruguay is aggrieved against Great Britain and France on theground that these Powers slight the national dignity of the  Republic by refusing to regard its courts as trustworthy and derogate  from  its sovereignty by declining  toaccept it as a partner in an Arbitration Treaty.                                    CHILE.   The Chilean Minister for Foreign Affairs on 13th September assured the american ambassador  that his Government  would  break off relations with  Germany  if theArgentine were to do so.   Sir F. Stronge  reports that the purchase  of  the  German-owned nitrate by theDupont Powder Company (vide Report No.  33, p. 16) has now been arranged.                               UNITED  STATES.    Lord Beading  arris^ed in Washington on 14th September and. had interviews withthe Secretary of the Treasury,  the  Secretary  of State,  the Allied  Ambassadors, andM. Tardieu.    Lord Reading has telegraphed to the  Chancellor of  the Exchequer urging theimportance of being able to grant the United  States some reciprocity of treatment inall matters in which they furnish us wdth assistance.  More particularly he urges thatwe ought to arrange that the United States should be furnished by  us with credits fortheir purchases within the  British Empire, outside  of Canada, to set off against the advances which they furnish us for purchases in the United States.  Americans naturallylook upon the British Empire as a single unit, and cannot understand why their pur-chases of wool from Australia and of jute from India must be paid  for in gold insteadof being set off against their advances to the British Empire.   There will, in any case,he points out, be a great reluctance to license any more gold to India, though  silvermay possibly still be furnished.  Similarly in  regard  to munitions and equipment,where France seems largely to  have  captured the orders, he urges that we should show readiness  to  give material assistance wdierever we  can, e.g., in  the matter ofcloth, and asks for a full list of all the supplies in which the War  Office considers itmight be able to assist.  The constant publication of  large advances to  us creates an impression that  the United States do everything and that we do nothing, and it will help our diplomacy greatly if we have favours to offer as well as to accept,  and if wecan secure that those favours, when asked for, are granted throughout the Empire.    Pending the preparation of conventions for reciprocal  compulsory military service,the Senate has passed a resolution  making all  male persons resident in the UnitedStates for over a year liable unless exempted by treaty.   Sir C. Spring  Rice is trying to arrange that this shall not apply to subjects of countries  wdth which conventionsmay be concluded by the United States.    The Senate has strengthened the hands of  the President in the administration ofthe Trading  wdth  the Enemy  Act,. by vesting the power of dispensing with  theprovisions of this Act in the hands  of the President alone, who may, however, delegateit as he may  see fit, and Sir C. Spring Rice hopes  that this will lead to the taking of&quot;vigorous action against enemy firms.     3897-3                             D
   The President has  prohibited the importation into the United  States  of sugar,syrup, and molasses after 1st October except under licence,  and Sir C.  Spring Riceunderstands that the questions of the prohibition of other imports  and of the exportof gold will be co-ordinated  with that of the exchange  by the creation of  Boards ofImports and of Exchange which, together with the Board of Exports, will be putunder one head.   Sir 0. Spring Rice reports that  as  the result of an informal intimation from theDepartment of Justice, all New York Banks have broken off relations with GermanBanks.   The United States Exports Board has invited the regular, but informal, co-operationof British and French representatives.   An embargo  has been placed on the  export of paper excepting that  consigned to approved destinations.                             SHIPPING  SITUATION.   According to the War Trade Intelligence Report the total tonnage, OA^er 500 tonsgross in the case of steamers and 100 tons gross in the case  of sailing  ships, reported lost  owing to the malice  of the King&apos;s  enemies  during  the period 7th september to 13th September inclusive, is  70,027  tons, of Avhich 37,128 tons were British, ascompared with 123,355 tons of Avhich 82,905 tons Avere British, reported last Aveek.   The German Naval Authorities informed, the Grand Committee  of the Reichstag inJuly  that 40 submarines had been  lost since  1st February  of this  year, Avhile theoutput varied from 8 to 12 per month.   Sir W. Townley reports that certain  Germans are very closely connected Avith, andare freely buying the shares of  the  Dutch PIolland-Amerika Line  Avhich is using itsgreat commercial ascendancy gained during the neutrality of the United States to the detriment of the Allies after the Avar, and suggests that the United  States Governmentshould select the ships of this Company before  all others, if  any Dutch shipping is tobe requisitioned.   The United States Government are pressing for  a settlement in the matter of theex-enemy ships taken over  by China, as they learn  that  failing a proximate decision the Japanese may  secure them all, in which  case there is no  guarantee that they will.be used for benefit of Allies.  The delay is  largely caused  by the unacceptability ofthe United States  proposal  that the ex-Austrian ships should be handed over to an american firm, which purchased  them  before  the declaration of  Avar hj China, andthat the  United  States should, in addition, have an equal share of the ex-German shipstogether with Great Britain and Japan.                             PEACE  DISCUSSIONS.   The unfounded assertion, Avhich Avas met last Aveek with  an official denial, thatGreat Britain had  made  overtures of peace  to Germany,  is reported  by Sir PLRumbold to have originated in a Stock Exchange manoeuvre of the Austrian bankersBettlheim and Rosenberg.   Sir W. Townley learns that fears are entertained  in Avell-informed Austrian officialcircles that Austria will be compelled to send an answer  to  the Papal peace proposalswhich will not be in accordance with her real views, inasmuch as it will  have to be soworded as to contain no  opening of Avhich the Entente might make use  to initiatepeace negotiations, as Germany declines to permit peace to be made until treaties ofcommerce have been made with her three Allies which will  make them her  economicslaves after the war.  It is also thought that Germany may buy off  Italy Avith Austrianterritory, as, if  Italy makes peace,  France might be  expected to follow suit, and asRussia is of no more account, only Great Britain and the United. States would remain to be dealt with by Germany.  It is possible that these views  represent the opinion ofCount Czernin who has just returned from Berlin.   The question of Belgium was notreferred  to.    Count de Saiis understands that  the Nuncio in Munich has learnt that the Germanreply to  the Pope&apos;s Note will be sent within a week and will be favourable.   The Belgian Minister in Paris understands that  the reply will  offer  autonomywithin the  German  Empire to  Alsace-Lorraine,  the  evacuation  of France andBelgium, where  the division into Flanders and  Wallonia is, hoAveArer, to be maintained,and  will give assurances about Poland.
    Sir W. Townley reports that members of the Austrian Legation in The Hague havereceived letters from  Kiihlmann  confidently anticipating peace  by  Christmas  andremarking that the Entente would have to &quot; eat its soup cooler than it was cooked.&quot;  Atthe same time the unchangeable intention of Germany to retain  her  entire colonial empire is officially trumpeted in selected organs of the German Press as an irreduciblebasis for possible peace negotiations.    Addressing  the  National Safety Council  in New  York on 12th SeptemberPresident Lowell, of Harvard University, declared that the oppression of one race by another must, as far as possible, be removed.  &quot; For that reason we cannot consider&quot; the return to Germany of  her former Colonies that their people may be exploited as&quot; they have been in  the past.&quot;   This declaration  is  reported  to have  been received with a storm of cheering.  In view of President  Lowelbs great influence as the leader of American University thought, it  is likely to give rise to  considerable discussion.    In a speech delivered in  New York on 19th  September by Mr.  Holman, Premier ofNew South Wales, the statement that Australia,  having taken German New Guinea,proposed  to keep it and not let the Germans&apos; return  to establish a base of operationsthere, was received with cheers.    According to a Budapest  Press telegram, the Hungarian Catholics, supported by theConservative nobles  and the  Christian Socialists, have arranged a great peace meeting in Budapest for 23rd September at which Erzberger  of the German Centre Party willbe  present.  They propose  to start  a peace movement  on  the  lines of  the  Papalproposals.  M. Ribot, in conversation with Lord Bertie, has  suggested that the Allied conference should be held soon, so as  to  settle the best  means for dealing  wdth German peacemanoeuvres.    The  Organising Committee  of  the  Stockholm  Conference on 18th Septemberpublished a manifesto  protesting that the  proposal  to  hold  the  Conference has notbeen abandoned and urging the organised proletariat to take  &quot; To Stockholm&quot; as itswatchword, as the &quot;brutal refusal&quot; of passports  cannot deprive the Avorking classesof their elementary right.                                   GENERAL.    The Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs entirely denies  that his Government has agreed to effect the  repatriation of prisoners across  the Austro-Russian front,  but ineffect this is not a denial of  the statement made  last Aveek in Stockholm to the effectthat an agreement for  the wholesale exchange of combatant prisoners of war had beencome to between the tAvo Powers.    In vieAV  of. the  report of the visiting Commission  of  Dutch doctors  upon  thecondition of the British prisoners of war  in Germany, His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment have been obliged to point out that the sanitation of the camps at Brandenburg,Schwarmstadt, and Hameln is bad, that the camps are overcrowded, and that they Avilltake a serious view of  any delay in remedying this state of affairs.    Having learned from a former member  of  the American  Embassy in Berlin thatthe  Germans are more  impressed by the  observations of doctors than by those.ofdiplomatists, Sir W. Townley is trying to arrange for the appointment of  tAvo moreDutch doctors  for the visiting  of British  prisoners of Avar  in Germany, and  at thesame time to make arrangements for the reception of exchanged  British prisoners in holland.    The German Government haAre agreed again  to  permit the distribution of parcelsfor British prisoners of Avar.    Representations have been  made pointing out  to the Ottoman Government the steps they will have to take in order to secure the release of Ayoub Sabri.
