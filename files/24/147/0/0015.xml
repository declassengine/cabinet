SECRET.APPRECIATION  OP  THE  ATTACHED  WESTERN  AND GENERAL                           REPORT, No.  40.                                     CANADA.   Mr. Fielding&apos;s adhesion, to the new Onion Government ought  to ensure its success in the Maritime  Provinces,  the  only portion  of  English.  speaking-Canada  -whereSir W. Laurier still had some hope of retaining his old ascendency.                                  SOUTH AFRICA.   General  Botha&apos;s last speech is noteworthy both for its reiteration of the unity ofthe South African nation against the racial mischief makers, and for its insistence onthe importance, of South Africa having a say in the terms of peace.                            THE ALLIED CONFERENCE.   The participation of the United States at the forthcoming Allied Conference is agreat step in advance.  As, however,  the participation  is on the understanding thatit is  a Conference to discuss the conduct of  the  war and not the terms of peace, andas the Sovyet delegate, on. his side, has  been sent to discuss terms of  peace ratherthan the conduct of the war, the  situation will require some tactful handling,  ddiepresence of a  Sovyet  delegate has, incidentally, created, the  most  acute  anxiety inRumania, whose territorial claims,  as  accepted  by the Allies, have  been  consistentlydenounced by the Sovyet, not without  some justification, as the most striking instanceof &quot; Imperialist &quot; aggression on the Allied side.                                     FRANCE.   The reconstructed Government seems to have shown a  certain lack of  balance bothin its zeal to exculpate Malvy and in its exaggeration of  the so-called &quot; Royalist plot,&quot;and  cannot yet be said to  be firmly in  the saddle.   The main danger ahead  of it is,however, not so much the revival of old political animosities as  the  shortage of foodwdiose full seriousness  is only now beginning to be realised in Government quarters.                                       ITALY.   ddie immediate effect  of  the disaster on  the Isonzo has been steadying,  ddieresignation  of the  lioselli  Administration  was  made easy  by  its  own  dignifiedacceptance  of  the  situation  and by the sympathetic  attitude of  the  Chamber.   Inrallying the nation  to stop the rout Signor Orlando  has behind  him every section in politics  except the extreme Socialists.   Here again  the  real danger is  not  theimmediate effect upon public opinion of a lost battle, but the after effect of an uphillmilitary situation complicated by a serious food crisis.
                                ENEMY AFFAIRS.   Now that the last independent Austrian front has been taken over by the Germans,nominally under the supreme command of the Emperor  Charles,  and taken over withsuch brilliant success, the German domination of Central Europe may be regarded as complete,  and we are not likely to hear much more of Austrian  hankerings afterindependent  action.  Meanwhile, the  appointment,  if confirmed, of a Bavarian and aCatholic  to  the German  Imperial  Chancellorship, instead  of  a  dour North-GermanProtestant, and the separation of the  Imperial Chancellorship from  the PrussianPremiership, will help to give that domination a less Prussian and, consequently, more acceptable flavour.   It must be admitted that, as against  its  blundering tactlessness indealing with enemies and neutrals whose mentality it  cannot  follow,  German higherpolicy has been  both farseeing and tactful in the way in which it has identified itself with the point of  view of its Allies while steadily extending its  control over them.                                    HOLLAND.   If the  Dutch really mean, as the latest reports  suggest, to try  economic counterreprisals  by  cutting oil Java sugar  and refusing cable  facilities in the East Indies, wemay find ourselves in a stale of acute economic  warfare  wdth a Power with which weare otherwise at peace.  Such a situation will be awkward and possibly even  dangerous.It will, in any case, detract from the amenities of Holland as a place  of internment forour prisoners in Germany.                                      SPAIN.   No Government has repjaced the Dato Administration so far.  It will be difficultto find another so friendly lo ourselves, and a Government formed  under the impression of German victories on the lsonzo  may easily start with something of a pro-Germanbias.1st November 1917.L.

PART  I.-BRITISH  EMPIRE AND  AFRICA.                                    CANADA.   Mr. W. S. Fielding,  ex-Liberal Minister of Finance and.  hitherto one of Sir YV.LauriePs most prominent supporters, has decided to support the new.  Union Govern-ment and  will contest the Shelburne and Queen&apos;s constituency in their interests at theforthcoming  elections.  Mr. Fielding  has issued a manifesto to  the Liberals of NovaScotia in which he appeals to Canadians  to support the Union Government as themost effective way of winning the war, and states that the national peril and the&quot; Quebec  attitude &quot; make the union of the  Parties imperative,  ddie  adhesion  ofMr. Fielding&apos;will  involve  support for the  National Government from other LiberalLeaders in the  Maritime Provinces, and  it  is to be noted that the Premier of NovaScotia,  has already made  a strong appeal  to  the electors to  support the UnionGovernment.   One of the  duties of the  Prime Minister  under the Military  Voters  Act  is to designate  a candidate for each riding as a Government candidate in order that soldiersmay know for whom to vote if they desire to support the  Government.   Sir P. Bordenhas  therefore stated that it is the earnest desire  of the  Government  that in  eachconstituency  supporters  of the Union  Government,  whether Liberal, Conservative,Labour, or Independent,  should confer and endeavour to agree upon a candidate who may be treated as the Government supporter.   Besides  occupying the Vice-Chairmanship (which  will  mean  in.  practice the presidency in the absence of the Prime  Minister)  of  the  Reconstruction and -Develop-in ent Committee of the Cabinet, Mr. A. Iv. MacLean has been appointed Vice-Chair man of the  Treasury Board, and will act  as Minister of Finance  in the absence of sir thomas White.  Mr. MacLean has  been  in  the past  one of  the  most  prominentfinancial experts upon the Opposition Benches.   Mr. Rodolphe Lemieux (formerly Liberal  Minister of Marine and Fisheries under sir  W.  Laurier) has  declared his  belief that conscription is  a camouflage  underwhich &quot;Rule Britannia&quot; can be sung and Quebec insulted as  a Province of shirkers.He  added this was a libel on  Quebec  as  there were 25,000 French-Canadian troopsabroad.   Mr. F. B. Car veil (Liberal Minister for  Public Works in the new  Government) has stated  that   those  who  joined the Union  Government  through  disagreement with sir W.  Laurier on compulsory military  service were  still  Liberals.    lie made anappeal to  all  to drop their political prejudices at this election and to aid in winningthe war.   ddie position of  Canadians  of  military age  resident in  France is occupyingattention,   ddie Anglo-French  agreement  recently concluded refers  to men between18  and -11,  whereas - up to the present the Canadians affected under the MilitaryService Act are men between 18 and 34.                      AUSTRALIAN  COMMONWEALTH.   On account of the feeling that hasbeen manifested in the Commonwealth in favourof the  conscription issue  being again submitted  to  a  Referendum,  the anti-con-scriptionists of Sydney have commenced  an active  campaign  against those who are endeavouring to influence the Federal Parliament to submit the question to the peoplefor the second time.   At the bye-election  for the Grampians  Division  of Victoria  the  Nationalistcandidate for the Federal Parliament. (Mr. dowett) obtained a majority of  2,000 overhis Labour opponent.   With regard  to the discontinuance of the  practice of  accommodating totallyincapacitated members of  the  Australian Imperial  Forces, who&apos;have received theirdischarge,  on Hospital ships on account of the technical difficulty  of  their  being
merely passengers,  the Commonwealth Government  have pointed out that the safety of these men  is  affected  by their incapacity when travelling on transports liable toattack.   The fact of this incapacity, combined with their uiifitness for further active service, is submitted  as  a valid  answer to any technical objection  by the enemy tothese men travelling cn Hospital ships to the United Kingdom.,    In. order to provide an area for the settlement of  returned soldiers, the New SouthWales Government have  determined to extend  the Murrumbidgee irrigation, settle-ment, oue of the  most important irrigation  schemes in Australia.   For this purpose aBill has been  introduced into the House of Assembly providing for  the widening ofthe main canal at a cost of 500,OOOL, spread over  four years.  TJie sum of 250,600Z.&quot;will be spent  in opening up good land..    The Commonwealth Government have been informed that owing to the transport difficulties on the Rhodesian Railways a serious  shortage in the  delivery of  chromeore,  urgently required for  munition  purposes, has  arisen.   The  situation has beenbrought about by increased  traffic, delay in the delivery of  new locomotives and  lackof repairing facilities, and  as it is  impossible to transfer suitable  engines from theUnited.  Kingdom, the Australian Government are asked whether they could  arrangefor a loan to  the Rhodesian  Railways  of  ten  3-ft. 6-in. gauge  engines, and  if so on what terms.                               NEW  ZEALAND.    On account of the reduction in  percentage of reinforcements and to arrangementshaving been made for the periodical return  of officers who  have seen active service,the Dominion Government have a surplus of from 30 to 75 officers who were undergoingtraining for reinforcements.   It is therefore asked if these officers could be absorbed in the Imperial or Indian Army for the period  of  the war, after a  short course oftraining in England  or  India.  It  is believed that the experience gained by such officers would be of great ultimate value to the New Zealand Territorial forces.    The Dominion Government have urged that arrangements should be made as soonas possible for the transport of oil  from the United States in suitable vessels, as it  isexpected that the supply of  case oil in New Zealand will be exhausted by the end ofDecember.                               SOUTH  AFRICA.   General  Botha,  in  the  course  of  a speech in his constituency, referred, to thenecessity of  the Union having a voice  in the negotiations for  peace. . He said that  itappeared to  him. that the war would continue for  a long time, but it  -was  better to.light it to  a finish than to  conclude peace to-day  and restart  the war to-morrow.&quot; When peace is made,&quot; he added, &quot; it is  important that South Africa shall have  asay in  the decision.&quot;   With regard to the racial  question  in the Union, the PrimeMinister denounced the mischief makers who. were trying to separate  the two whiteraces.   He added, &quot; Those who love South Africa will help  me to build up a  greatSouth African race and a great nation.&quot;   The Union Government have, pointed,  out that the  advance made  by the BritishGovernment to 31st March 1917, in order to meet the expenses of the Imperial ServiceContingents  and the campaign in German East Africa, closely approximates to theexpenditure incurred to that date.   Up to 31st December next, it is  estimated  that expenditure will amount to 2,650,000t.  The latter figure can be met to the  extent of1,900,000Z.-representing the Union  grant of  1,000,0001.  and 900.000Z., which willbe then due for excess pay.   The Union Ministers  therefore request that the  balanceof 750,0001. may be advanced by the British Government.   With reference to the suggestions that have been made from  time to time  for a union or Coalition between the  South African Party under  General Botha and theUnionists under Sir Thomas Smartt, with a new Party designation, one of the membersof the  Union Government,  Sir Thomas Watt, made an  interesting public pronounce-ment in a  recent speech.   Instead of a  new Party, he said, &quot; What objection can&quot; Unionists have to  joining the South African Party V  The  aims of  the two parties
&apos;&quot; are practically the same.   Both adhere to  the Constitution and wish to win the war.&quot; Both wish to see the agricultural and mineral resources of the  country developed,  and industries established, and both want  to encourage  education, while both  have&quot; the same desire to make the natives better and more useful members of society.&quot;   The Governor-General announced in a  speech to the  Congress of Chambers ofCommerce at Johannesburg, that a Conference will be held at Pretoria, at which theNaval Authorities  will be present, in  order to  co-ordinate land  and sea  transport-Lord Buxton also foreshadowed, a great reduction in passenger traffic  with a view toeconomy.   A. great mass meeting was held in the City Mall, Cape Town, to celebrate TrafalgarBay.  Mr. Merriman, in, addressing  the gathering, referred  to the deeds  of  thepresent day Navy, which he said had given  so  many glorious  examples of the trueNelson touch.   Ail the stocks of petrol in the Union have been temporarily commandeered by theUnion Defence Porce.   With reference to the suggestion of the  Union Ministers that the.British Govern-ment should purchase such portions of the  mohair clip as tire growers may desire tooffer (vide Report No. 38), it has been pointed out to them that, owing to the necessityof adjusting  purchases  in  proper proportions  of  different  qualities, it  would  bedifficult  to purchase  only  a  portion  of the  clip.  The Union  Government  have therefore  been asked if they can. offer the whole of the mohair clip.   The Union Government have  been informed&apos; that the recommendations of theTechnical Committee regarding wool purchases  (vide  Report No.  37)  are beingcarefully  considered and  a  further reply  will be  sent in the light of experience gained with regard to the purchase of the Australian  and New  Zealand clips togetherwith other information likely to be of value.    The South African railways are finding it extremely difficult to deal with the heavytraffic connected with the shipment of  coal  and with such commodities for  export  asmaize, meat,  and &quot;wool,  ddie Union Ministers have  pointed out that everything hasbeen done to  maintain the traffic, but the resources of the railways are rapidly neapingexhaustion, and unless early delivery of the urgently required material can be made, alarge number of engines and trucks will have to be removed from service within thenext few  months.   The requirements are either spare parts, such as steel boiler tubes and plates, or new rolling stock.   The traffic is far  greater now than before the war,and the mileage recorded in  1.91.6 was 5,250,000 miles greater than in 1915.  Therequest of the Ministers for the above supplies is very strongly supported in a telegramfrom the Governor-General.                                  RHODESIA.   e   ddie wages  and running staff of  the Rhodesian Railways, involving most of thedrivers and stokers, gave  notice a short time  ago of their intention to strike if their demand  for  a 25  per cent, increase in wages was  not  granted.   The resident commissioner at Salisbury reported, however, on 26th October that the labour position on the railways was more hopeful.  The notices  had been withdrawn by the  men,and the General Manager  had agreed to discuss arbitration with them.                  SOUTH-WEST AFRICAN PROTECTORATE.   -   The export of cattle  and  sheep from  the&apos; South-West Protectorate  has  beenprohibited (except by special permit) on account of the serious shortage arising  fromthe slaughter of breeding stock.
part  II.-FOREIGN  AFFAIRS.                              ALLIED AFFAIRS.   In view of the proposals  put forward  that a  delegate  of  the  Retrograd Sovyetshould attend the forthcoming Allied Conference in Paris in order to air extremeRussian views about Peace, the British Government have circularised the Major Alliesreminding them that the meeting in Paris  is to be a War Conference,  as the UnitedStates  representative has been  specially accredited  for the purpose  of discussing&quot;means for prosecuting the war to a victorious conclusion, and is empowered to attendno other Conference than a War Conference.   On 25th October, M. Skobeleff, the delegate of the Sovyet, waited upon the british ambassador  in Petrograd with a view  to  ascertaining how his presence at theConference would be viewed in Great Britain.   lie was unofficially informed thatwhile his presence in London might help  to secure a better understanding  betweenthe British and Russian peoples,  his interference in Paris would have no sort of effect upon the opinions or decisions of Members of the War Conference.  Sir G. Buchananalso  had an  opportunity of expressing his  opinion of  the  SovyeFs Peace  terms toM. Skobeleff.  Sir G. Buchanan  describes the delegate of the Sovyet  as a weak andinsignificant  man of no personality,  who, although, he can only  speak German  inaddition to his native language, is not pro-German or an active Pacifist.   The Journal des  Debats ascribes the disaster on the Italian front to the  action ofRussian Revolutionaries and the inaction  of  the Russian Government ;  it advocatesthe assumption  of executive  control, backed, by armed force, over  Russia  by  theUnited States, as being the sole method of enabling Russia to reconstitute her forces,save her existence and keep her word,  and finally calls for the exclusion of M. Skob elefffrom Allied territory, as being the suspect advocate of a ridiculous programme.   Sir G. Barclay reports that the Rumanian Prime Minister  is greatly exercised inmind about  the proposed  attendance of a delegate  of the Petrograd  Sovyet at theAllied War Conference, and considers that any talk of peace such as  the  Sovyet is determined to start would adversely affect Rumanian moral,  ddie  Rumanian Govern-ment are anxious  that the Allies should  summon up  sufficient energy to reject theproposals of the Sovyet in the manner which  they deserve.   As it is of importance that, the meeting of the War Conference should not be delayedbeyond the middle of November, the  British  Government  have suggested that Japanmight  arrange to be represented by one of her Ambassadors in Europe.  Both GreatBritain and the  United States are anxious that a  Japanese representative should  be present. &quot;   Sir G-. Buchanan reports that the Russian Delegation to the Allied War Conference,consisting of  the  Minister for Foreign Affairs, two  Generals, an Admiral,  and arepresentative of the Ministry of Finance, will leave  Petrograd for  Bergen at thesame time as himself.   In  view of the difficulties which have arisen in connection with the Russian transittrade through Sweden, and the Allied embargo on exports to the  Northern Neutrals,the Foreign  Office is anxious that advantage be taken of the  presence of Mr. Nord-mann, head of the Russian Department for the  Restriction of Enemy Supplies, inLondon,  and suggests that an Inter-Allied Conference to discuss the Swedish situation should meet in London.  At this Conference it  is  hoped Swedish representatives would discuss a comprehensive agreement with delegates of the Allies and the UnitedStates.   Sir 0.  Spring Rice is  directed to  invite the State Department to send  a competent representative to London to attend this  Conference and to use  every  effort to persuade it to agree to do so.                                    FRANCE.   M. Bar thou, the new  Minister  of Foreign Affairs in M. Painleve&apos;s  reconstitutedMinistry, speaking in the Chamber  for the first time  after a three j^ears&apos; silence,declared that France would never abandon Russia, and  insisted  upon  the  return of alsace-Lorraine to France as  being  on the  same footing as  the  evacuation of herother occupied departments by the Germans.  Lord Bertie reports that the Minister for
Foreign Affairs was well received by the majority of the Chamber  in  spite  of thegreat hostility shown  towards  him by the Socialists  and  the extreme RadicalSocialists  on  the  question of  the  guarantees  for the future safety of  France  towhich lie  referred without  defining their nature  or  extent.  M.  Renaudel, in theHumanite, considers that M. Barthou failed to adapt his conception of war and peaceto that which the  Democratic and  Socialist  spirit begins to  formulate forcibly  inall countries.   At its first  division  on 25th October the reconstituted Ministry was supported by 288 votes  to 137, a majority of  151 to be compared, with that of  272,which was its last majority (on 19th October) before being reconstituted.   The Radical Socialist Congress ou 27th October passed resolutions affirming thenecessity  of reconquering  Alsace-Lorraine  and  binding members to the Party  to decline office in any Ministry except with the consent of the  Executive Committee  ofthe Party and the Deputies of  the Party in the  Chamber.  M.  Caillaux spoke  at themeeting, supporting M. Malvy against the attacks of M. Daudet and emphasising thefact  that Avhile France when led by democracy had  always been victorious, democracywas  always  exposed  to the attacks of reactionary calumniators.   ddbis Conference has not called upon the Radical-Socialist members of the ministry to resign,  but Lord Bertie considers  that there is  no longer an)&apos;  possibility  of aBarthou Administration  with  Socialist participation,  and reports that  the Left  iscontemplating another Viviani  Cabinet.   ddio French Chamber has  adjourned until 6th November.  This will effectivelyprevent any ministerial crisis before that date.    Following the official and pre-judicial exculpation of M. Malvy, the offices  of theAction Franeaise, which is  conducted  by M. Daudet, his accuser, and other Royalistcentres in Paris and the provinces, were raided and searched by the police.    The action of the Government  in  accusing MM. Daudet and  Maurras of beingimplicated  in  a  plot to provoke  civil  war in  hopes of bringing  about a RoyalistRestoration is approved  oidy by Le Pays.  Other journals refer to it as a most seriousblunder,  or as a clumsy  attempt to save  M.  Malvy and  shelve  the Bolo scandal,M. Sembat in the Humanite fears that the Prime Minister has made himself ridiculousand  Lord Bertie reports that public opinion entirely declines to take the &quot; Royalist Plot &quot;seriously.   Attention is drawn to the fact that it was M.  Daudet who called upon theGovernment to arrest and  break up the Bonnet Rouge gang, which was trying to buyLa Journal for the Germans, and Le Figaro maintains that no efforts of  the Govern-ment will make it  possible for an &quot;Affaire Daudet&quot; to smother the &quot; Affaire Bolo.&quot;M. Idiomas, in a speech at Commentry on 28th October, referred to the &apos;&quot;&apos; Affaire Daudet &quot;as an. attempt on the part of the  Government to strike a political balance between theParties of the Right and those  of the Left.   He further criticised the Government forits  lax methods of waging war, and  emphasised the communitj- between the war-aims of the Socialist Party and French traditions.                                    BELGIUM.    Sir W.  Townley learns  that the German  authorities in  the occupied area  ofBelgium have made the Decree of 9th  August,  enforcing the sole use of Flemish in flanders, applicable to the correspondence  of the  Belgians employed by the ComiteNational  and  the Comite  des Pays Bas Espagnols.  This  measure is expected to cause the resignation of some 30,000 Belgians, and thus bring  to a close the beneficialactivities of the Belgian Relief Commission.   Representations  are being made by theDutch and  Spanish  Ministers  in Brussels to  their respective  Governments, and  SirWalter ToAvnley  urges the Foreign Office to intimate the intention of the  BritishGovernment to suspend ail measures of relief in the affected provinces of Belgium, asthe  action of the German authorities is contrary to undertakings given on. the subject by the German Government.                                      ITALY.    Assurances have been giA^en to the Italian  Government by Great Britain  as wellas by France that assistance will be forthcoming to enable  Italy to deal with  themilitary situation,   ddie Italian  Government  have  expressed  their sincere  gratitude to His Majesty&apos;s Government for  their cordial  sentiments  and for. their military assistance.
   As was anticipated, the Administration  of  Signor Boselli, which  caine into  being in June 1916, resigned office after being defeated in the Chamber  on 25th  Octoberby 314  votes to 96, on  a question  of confidence.  The  King of Italy  returned to rome from the Isonzo front in order to deal personally with the political situation.His Majesty gave audience to Senator  Manfredi,  the  President of the  Senate,  and sign or Mtircora, the President of the Chamber of Deputies.  There are two alternatives to be. faced,  even  though a  temporary Orlando  Ministry may act as  a stop-gappending the readjustment of the military situation,  ddie  first of these, in the opinionof the Intelligence Bureau, is a Ministry pledged to a policy of &quot; Thorough &quot; both onthe external and internal fronts, a policy  which may precipitate a revolution.   Theother alternative is  an  Administration  either  openly  directed or  secretly inspired by Signor Giolitti, which, relying for support on the Pacifist and Socialist vote,  wouldadvocate -a policy of peace by negotiation on pro-German  and anti-Allied lines, andof restoration as soon as  possible of economic relations with Germany.   Mr.  Erskine reported that the King of Italy on 27th October asked Signor Orlandoto form a Ministry, and considered that the retention of Baron Sonnino at the  ForeignOffice was certain.   Signor Carcano, owing to  ill-health, was  expected  to &quot;leave theTreasury.  Signor Orlando is considered to have been handicapped in the executionof his duties as Minister  of the Interior  in the late Administration,  owing to  his notbeing, as has hitherto been usual in Italian Cabinets, Prime Minister as well.   SignorOrlando was successful  and  the new Italian  Cabinet, which  was, sworn  in  on 30thOctober, at 6 pan., is constituted, as follows :-     Prime  Minister  and  Minister  of  the       Interior     Minister for Foreign Affairs     Minister of War -     Minister of Marine     Minister of Finance     Minister of the Treasury     Minister of Munitions     Minister of Transport     Minister of Justice     Minister of Education     Minister  of Public Assistance       sions   -      -       -      -       -     Minister of Trade and Labour  -     Minister of Colonies            - &apos;      -     Minister of Posts and Telegraphs     Minister of Public Works     Minister of Agriculture   -   Ministers who held the same Office  in theindicated by an asterisk.

Serjent, the  French Financial Commissioner, has completed his mission to Athens -without awaiting the arrival of his British colleague.The Foreign  Office considers this to be unfortunate, as it holds that a - co-ordinationof financial policy between the two Allies must necessarily be a preliminary to success-ful co-ordination of financial action,  and suggests to Sir C. Spring  Rice that theCommittee of Two be  enlarged by  the  addition  of a representative  of the  UnitedStates in  order to undertake a joint preliminary enquiry into the financial, resourcesof Greece and  into the  financial policy to be adopted by the Allies towards  her.  TheFrench Government are also being pressed to agree with this suggestion.   Lord Granville reports that M. Venizelos,  on leaving Athens  on 29th October,proceeded  to Corfu  in order to  converse  with M.  Pashitch,  the Serbian  PrimeMinister, and thence left by way of Taranto for Rome,  where he now is.   Mr. Erskine  learns  that  the   Italian Government   deny having  put forward proposals  for the modification of the Grceco-Italian arrangements  in  Epirus  (vide report No. 39, page 8).   They explain that the  evacuation of Konitza has  only  been postponed pending the evacuation  by Greek troops of certain specified villages.
   According to a despatch  from Mr.  Crackanfhorpe, the Peloponnese, includingCorinth, is  almost  enemy territory.  There has  been boycotting of Venizelists  atSparta and  rioting about Kalamata.   A gang of former submarine agents under oneMichael Kouremetis  is reported to have taken up its quarters  at Gythion.   Similarsuspicious persons  have proceeded to Kardamili, Kalamata and.  Monemvasia.   TheGerman organisers who lay hidden for a time at Kalavryta are now coming out again and returning to their  posts.  Detachments of loyal  troops  are kept moving aboutalmost as  if they were in an. enemy&apos;s country.   ddie Charge d&apos;Aft&apos;aires, after reviewing the situation in  Greece, considers that itshould not be viewed with undue optimism and emphasises  the  necessity for  finding a remedy  for the food, shortage.  Should this be omitted the position  of the PrimeMinister will be  undermined  by his political opponents and the present  apathy withregard, to  participation in the war may develop into something more serious.                       &apos;   ENEMY ALLIED  AFFAIRS.   Sir W, Towiiley reports that Herr von KiUdmami met Dr. Wekerle, the HungarianPrime Minister, and  Count Michael Karolyi at  Budapest, where  an   after  dinnerdiscussion as to peace terms  was conducted with some  freedom,  and  subsequentlyhad a political conference in Vdenna, with  the result of wdiich he is understood  to havebeen well satisfied.                              GERMAN  AFFAIRS.   As far  as it is  possible to gather from  the somewhat  confused  remarks  ofthe German Press,   the  Ministerial  crisis  is  upon,  the  point  of  solution,  buton  lines  different from those recently  predicted.  It seems that on  23rd   october the leaders  of  the  Majority  Parties  had  interviews   wdth  Herr  Valentin!,   theEmperoFs Private Secretary, to whose  advice  the actual selection of Dr. Michaelisfor  the  post  of   Chancellor  is  popularly  ascribed.   Later  in  the  day   theChancellor  was received  in  audience  hy the  Emperor,  and next  morning  theleaders of  the  Majority Parties waited upon the Chancellor  and invited   him  to resign,   ddie Vorwarts  believes  that Dr. Michaelis  advised the Emperor  thatthere was no necessity for any change,  and  considers  that  his  supposed  actionin  so  doing  has  put  the  Emperor  into  a difficult situation, as   his retentionof Dr. Michaelis in face of the disapproval of  that functionary felt  by the Reichstagwould be a serious blow for  the Reichstag.    Sir II.  Rumbold  learns from  anintimate  friend  of  Herr  von KuhlmaniVs, a certain Herr  Said Ruete, a Zanzibari-German malcontent who  lives in  Zurich, that the Military Party, led by von Luden-dorif  and backed by the Pan-Germans and the great industrial interests, have  greatinfluence with  the Emperor  through Admiral  von Mailer, Chief  of the  Emperor&apos;sNaval Cabinet,  and Herr Valentin!.   The Admiral is reputed  to hold  spiritualisticprayer meetings for the emperor&apos;s edification, and his Party is almost as strong as atthe beginning of war and quite confident  as to the result,  ddie other Party  regardsvon Kuhlniann  as its leader.   He  realises the peril to wdiich German commerce wdllbe exposed  by any international policy of economic ostracism, but Herr  Ruete thinksvon Kuhlmami  has not been clever in choosing  his moment for coming  forward.   Inhis opinion Herr Erzberger is discredited, the Socialists  will,do nothing, and  theprevalent current of opinion favours the Militarist Party,  and is undermining  theposition of Dr. Michaelis.    &quot;Whether this has indeed been  the case is uncertain, but  Sir  W. Townley quotes aGerman Press Agency to  the effect that the Chancellor  and  Baron von  Herding,  theBavarian Prime Minister,  had been simultaneously received in audience  by  theEmperor on 29th October and that Dr. Michaelis  had then  resigned and immediatelybeen  succeeded  by  the Bavarian.   Another report maintains that Baron von Hertlinghad not yet accepted  the Imperial offer of promotion,   d^elegraphing on  31st October,Sir W. Townley quotes the Deutsche Tageszeitung  to the effect that while Baron vonHertling, the Prime  Minister  of  Bavaria,  becomes Chancellor of  the  Empire,  Dr.Michaelis remains Prime Minister  of Prussia.   Herr Wahnschaffe, wdio was an UnderSecretary of State in the days of  Prince  von bulow, succeeds Herr von Gravenitz inthe Chancery of the Chancellor.    The Christian National Labour Congress opened in Berlin on 28th October underofficial auspices. Allusion was made in the opening speech to  the  alleged intention        -i                             c
of the Allies to force a republican form  of Government upon the Germans  and. to deprive them of all  territory west of the Rhine.  The President, Herr  Stegerwald,asserted that Germans  entirely refused to accept foreign dictation as to their internal affairs and, not being Russians, were loyal to their Emperor and their Princely Houses.Later  he  inveighed against the  privileges of  property, and.  other  speakers, whileadvocating  the  maintenance  of  a strong monarchy, decried  the caste spirit  andpolitical privileges, and called for free public education.   Speaking at the meeting on29th October of the same Congress the finder Secretary of State, Herr von Braun, saidthat while  the  bread and  potato  ration could  be  maintained  at  the  present  figure,the latter could not be increased to 10 lbs. per  week per head, and  the  meat rationwould, have to be reduced.   According to information furnished  by Mr. Flaes, until  lately Dutch Consul-General at Hamburg, there is little left to eat at Hamburg and other places in. NorthGermany, where small-pox and other diseases are  rife.  He considers that Germanycannot hold out after the end of January.   Sir Esme Howard, in a despatch,  draws attention  to  statements  in the SwedishPress  as to the prevalence of &quot; night-blindness &quot; among the Germans.  This malady,which causes complete loss of the  power of vision  not only in  darkness  but  also intwilight, is known to have occurred epidemically in time of famine, and is now rifethroughout Germany as a consequence of the under-nourishment of the population.Dr. Nordenson  considers that it may be connected with a lack  of  fat in the dietary,as he  has  observed that  the condition  rapidly improves in  response to  a  diet ofunusually rich and greasy food.                               NETHERLANDS.   Speaking in the  Lower House on 23rd  October, the Dutch Minister for ForeignAffairs offered to lay before the House the diplomatic correspondence with both GreatBritain and Germany on the subject of the transit of sand and gravel through Hollandto Germany.  He stated  that the Netherlands  Government were prepared to go to arbitration on the matter,  but that as Great Britain had not proposed such  a  course,he did not feel justified in  doing so.  He quoted  the Treaties of 1839 and 1868, bywhich Holland considered herself bound to permit the export  of such quantities ofsand. and. gravel as were not to be put to military uses, and expressed  his willingness to examine carefully all evidence  which might  be adduced to prove that the  graveland sand, conveyed in transit had,  in  fact,  been  put to military use,  but  during thepast two years the Dutch Government had  already done all they could to ascertain for what purposes the material in question had been used.  The Minister also referred, tothe transit of metals, and was highly indignant with  the British Government for havingsuspended cable facilities.   Sir W. Townley,  commenting upon this, suggests that if papers are to be  publishedit should  be stipulated that  the entire correspondence should  be so treated,  as theMinister for Foreign Affairs sometimes forgets to insert despatches which  do not tellin. his favour (vide Report No. 39, page 1.0).   ddie Foreign Office has  received confidential  information from  Singapore that theGovernment of the Dutch East Indies are contemplating certain  reprisals on accountof the British embargo on commercial  telegrams.  The forms of reprisal indicatedare (a) prohibition of transmission of British telegrams to and from Australia by wayof Banjuwangi in Java, and (b) the prohibition of the  export of  sugar or petroleum.It is pointed out to Sir W.  Townley that  the first would  only  lead to a considerableloss  of  cable revenue, as  the Banjuwangi line  is only an alternative route ; and thesecond, though more serious as a  threat, could be  countered by refusing bunkers toDutch ships and requisitioning all those in British ports.   The  Foreign Office, in reference  to  the proposed  export  of horses, from theNetherlands to Germany, has  informed Sir W. Townley that such export  cannot berecognised as it would  constitute a breach of the Hides Agreement.   If persisted in,facilities for the import of hides and skins into Holland will be  withdrawn.   Sir W. Townley has been instructed to inform the Netherlands Oversea Trust thatthe British Government insist upon the cessation of the free import of coffee, tobacco,and  chinchona as from  1st January 1918.   Mr. Flaes, until  lately  Dutch  Cousul-General  at Hamburg, has privately giveninformation, transmitted by Sir W. 1&apos;Ownley, that the  Dutch Minister in Berlin is sopro-German that he will neither believe nor forward any official report detrimental to
the Germans.  He is  in the hah it  of  telling Hutch  Consular officers who send such reports that the statements cannot be true, as, had they been  so, the &quot;German ForeignOffice would already have advised him of the matte]-.                                SWITZERLAND.   Sir 11. Rumbold suggests that the Swiss loan to Great Britain might be arranged in return for a grant  of  tonnage facilities to  the Swiss Government on  a basis  of1,000,000  francs  per  5,000  tons  monthly.   British expenses in Switzerland  inconnection with interned men and munition purchases amount to about 6,000,000 francsmonthly,  consequently on  the proposed  basis, as  the  Swiss want 55,000  tons  ofshipping monthly, the  British minimum requirement of  1.0,000,000 francs  monthlywould  leave an ample margin.  An arrangement on these lines  would,  in Sir H.RumbohTs opinion, be preferable to  a joint loan  secured as  a result oE  joint Anglo-French negotiations.   Sir II. Rumbold supports the proposal, of his French colleague that France should.press tire  Swiss  for  certain categories&apos;of munitions of  which there  are plentifulsupplies  pending  the placing of United  States  contracts in January,  in order  tojDrevent these supplies  from becoming available for the Germans.   The President of the Swiss  Confederation  has   indicated to the United  StatesCharge d&apos;Affaires  in Berne three  of. the  American,  demands (vide Report No. 36,page 9), which he  says  it will be very difficult for Switzerland to grant.  These  dealwith tire export of preserved meat to the Central  Empires, the prohibition  of  cottonexports,  as  tending to limit Swiss  powers of  bargaining with Germany,  and theprohibition  of the export  of  articles  manufactured, from  American  machines,  astending to  provoke retaliation  from  Germany, which might produce confusion  inSwiss factories and hamper  the output of munitions to Allied orders.                                   NORWAY.   The Norwegian Parliament re-opened on 29th October.   The Foreign Office informs Sir M. Findlay that British commercial interests areuneasy at the complete cessation, of British export trade to Scandinavia, and expressesfears that the  cessation of Norwegian exports to Germany may lead to  an  extensionof the war to  Norway, which is  apparently undesirable  from a naval  and military point of  view.  Sir M. Findlay, in  reply, does not think  the  present Administration.will ever  abandon  neutrality, but thinks that as  public  opinion, on account of the sinking of the Scandinavian convoy, is very bitter  against the  Germans at the presentmoment Germany  may fear  action on the part of Norway  and  strike first.   In view ofthis possibility he suggests that the necessary precautions  be  taken to enable theAllies to co-operate with Norway at  short notice should the necessity arise.   Sir M. Findlay draws attention to the importance attached by the fish  preservingindustry to  the import of tin plates  and suggests  that a threat of interference in thesupply of this commodity  would  be  an  admirable lever in  negotiation wdth theNorwegian Government.   Sir C. Spring Rice  indicates that the negotiations of  the  War  Trade Board withdraw. Nansen have  broken down  and understands that  the  United States  Govern-ment might now accept a British proposal for an immediate simultaneous declaration by the British and United  States Ministers  in Christiania that  the  countries  at warwith. Germany will supply Norway wdth all her requirements in return for a completecessation of her exports to Germany.  To this proposal the Foreign  Office agrees, butconsiders that a  guarantee to supply  Norway  with  what she needs would  commitGreat Britain  too far.   The Foreign Office wishes  the negotiations to be transferredto Christiania and  is  urging  France  and  Russia to advocate  this  change  inAVasbington.   Sir M. Findlay advises the Foreign Office that on 25th October a Royal  Resolutioncame into force prohibiting the sale to persons other than the  Norwegian Governmentof vegetable and animal oils and fats of eveiy kind, including all sorts  of train and.fish oils.                                    SWEDEN.   Mr.  Hellner, the Minister for  Foreign Affairs  in the  new Administration,  on24th October  received  all  the Allied Ministers in Stockholm for the first time after-taking office.  Sir E. Howard reports that the Minister was quite emphatic about the
 absolute cessation  under  his regime  of  the practice of sending German  cypher telegrams through Swedish diplomatic channels,   tie  then referred to the possibility of Allied representations being made for the purpose of putting  pressure on Sweden to induce her to cut off all commercial relations with Germany, and announced that as it -would be  quite impossible  for Sweden  to adopt such a policy, he hoped the representations in question -would not be made.    Sir E. Howard learns from other sources  that the new Swedish Government are disposed to suggest an equal division of the iron-ore exports between the two groups of belligerents.   At present Germany is taking all the  iron-ore  she  can  get, and obtained some  3,500,000 tons in 1916.  It is probable that in  consequence of this - policy Germany now has at least a years  supply in  reserve, and the Swedes  are afraid that failure  to  accommodate Germany with a full supply will not really affect her seriously, but will  unfailingly provoke  retaliation  in the shape of a stoppage of the coal supply.   As this amounts to 174,000 tons for  September,  the  threat is one which inspires respectful attention to the wishes of Germany.    The Russian Minister in Stockholm has been informed by Mr. Hellner  that the right  of free  transit through Sweden  might  be  accorded to Russia in return for  a supply of benzine.  This commodity is now so scarce that  the West Coast fishermen find  that  fishing in benzine-burning motor craft  often is unremumerative.   An agitation is consequently on  foot to demand  an agreement with  the Allies  whereby the export of  fish to Germany be  suspended in return for benzine,  failing which benzine would be obtained  from Germany in return for fish.                                     SPALN.    Idie  Administration  of  Sefior Dato resigned office on  27th  October,  Spain thus becoming the third Latin nation to experience a Cabinet crisis within the same seven days.  Immediately after the Minister&apos;s resignation Don Alfonso received consecutively in audience the  Presidents of the  Senate and the Chamber of Deputies.   This action had been  foreshadowed to  Seiior Dato by His Majesty, and had  been taken as an indication that the Minister no longer enjoyed the King&apos;s  confidence.   Don Alfonso appears to have been unwilling to deal with the situation which has arisen owing to the action of the Military  Juntas (vide Report 39, page 12) without  consulting the Presidents of  the two Houses as to the advisability of dissolving  the Cortes.  Sir A. Hardinge understands  that  the demands formulated by  the  Military  Juntas deal chiefly with arrangements as to the procedure of military promotion.    Sir A. Hardinge  reports  that  King Alfonso has  received a number of  political leaders.    Of  these Count  Romanones and  the Marquess of Alhucemas  (Prieto)-advocated  the  formation of a Coalition Ministry under a Liberal Prime Minister. Others suggested that a non-political soldier who is in touch with the Military Juntas. General  Marina, who became Minister for War  on 17th  October, was put forward as being politically preferable  to General the Marquess of Tenerife (Weyler).    The King, however, appears at first to have been  guided by the advice  of  those former Prime Ministers who  advocated the formation of a Coalition Ministry, and Sir A . Hardinge reported that His Majesty  on 28th October had entrusted Senior Sanchez de Toca with  the duty of forming an Administration.   This statesman is President of the Senate, and has the reputation of being a pro-British Conservative.  Count Romanones,  a former Liberal Prime Minister, even informed  Sir A.  Hardinge that he was  disposed to accept Sehor de Toca&apos;s invitation to-join the Coalition Ministry.   Sehor Maura and the members  of the Reformist  Party declined, however, to co-operate,  and on 30th October  Sehor Sanchez de  Toca  abandoned  his attempts  to form, a Ministry owing apparently to lack of support among the Liberals.  It  is believed  that the King will now  call upon  the Marquess  of Alhucemas  to  return  to power.    The  British Ambassador pointed, out that while  a Conservative-Liberal  Ministry on coalition lines would be favourable to  the interests  of the Allies, an undesirable alternative -would be another  Maura  administration which would have  to lean  for support on the ultra Catholic elements in the country, which are strongly pro-German.  The  evil effects of this upon  future interpretations  of Spanish neutrality  would only  partially be mitigated if Sefior Osma were to be SenorMaura&apos;s Minister  for Foreign Affairs.    King Alfonso is not anxious  to change  the foreign policy of Spain  and told the Italian Ambassador that whatever Ministry came into  office  there would be no altera- tion in  that respect.   It is  interesting to record the opinion expressed by Count Romanones that the fall of  Seiior Dato has closed  the  career of  the last Rotativist Administration to hold office in Spain.
1315   The Intelligence Bureau commenting in anticipation upon the Ministerial crisis in spain refers to the fact that Senor Dato refused to yield to the. Mditary Juntas in thematter of the trial of Sehor Domingo, the Republican Deputy, who is unpopular in theArmy.  There  was an irregularity in his arrest, and the Prime Minister declined tocountenance a further breach of Parliamentary privilege by submitting his case for trialby a court-martial which would probably have ordered him to be shot.  Count Roman onesconsiders  that  this action  on the part of Sehor  Dato has not been forgiven  by  theMilitary, and this has probably conduced to his fall.  It is to be remembered that thecause of the Allies does not stand to gain in any way by the departure of ,Senor Dato,whose neutrality was more friendly than that of his predecessors, and undoubtedlyexposed him to the hostility of German interests throughout the country.   On 3rd October the High Commissioner of the Spanish Zone in Morocco prohibitedthe export of foodstuffs  except  to Spain.  This at first caused dismay in the Inter-national Zone of Tangier and unrest along the frontier  between  the two zones.   On27th October, however, Mr. Garnett reported that  the situation had been improved bythe decision of  the Anjera  tribes, supported  by Raisuli, to disregard the prohibitionwhich the Spanish High Commissioner has small means for enforcing.                                    JAPAN.   Sir C. Greene learns that Baron Ivato, the  leader of the  Opposition, speaking  on25th October, asserted that the dispatch  of troops to take an effective part in Europeanbattles was impossible.   ddie British  Ambassador reports  that  the negotiations  between  Japan and theUnited States are proceeding favourably.  He  is informed that the United States arelikely to  propose a mutual  self-denying ordinance providing for an  embargo on thesupply7 of arms or money to China under certain specified conditions.   ddie United States Minister in Peking is anxious  that the  Chino-Japanese ArmsAgreement (vide Report No. 39, page  15) should be made the subject of an exchangeof views between the United States, Great Britain and Japan,  ddie Foreign Office,however, deprecates  the suggestion,  and points out  to Sir  C. Spring Rice  that  noamount of views exchanged will lead  to any modification of  Japanese aims in China.It could, only result either in the withdrawal by the two Christian Powers of  their objections to Japanese action or to the precipitation  of a crisis in which they wouldappear as the avowed opponents of Japanese  aspirations, a most unhappy result at a mount such as this.                                    CHINA.   Sir J. Jordan learns  that the Military Governor of Canton, Chen-Ping-Kun, wasdismissed by Presidential  edict on  27th October, and  the Civil Governor  Li,  wdthwhom is associated General Mo of Swatow, appointed in his  place.  This involves acomplete breach with Lu-Yung-Ting and may lead to fighting at Canton between theKuang-Si.troops adhering to the deposed Chen  and  the Cantonese under Li and Mo.Consequently  the Peking Government  have invited the co-operation of  the AlliedConsuls in Canton to persuade  Chen to withdraw peaceably to Kuang Si.   The Foreign Office is inclined to oppose any advance being made to the ChineseTreasury, which has asked for  2,O00,O00Z. on  account  out of the projected loan forcurrency reform, and points out that there  will  be plenty of money available from theCustoms receipts at the end  of the year,  ddie British Government are,  however,prepared to consider the advisability of sanctioning an advance if Japan considers itto be desirable or necessary.   Sir J. Jordan learns that the United States are offering China a loan of $25,000,000(gold) to be applied  for general war purposes,  the  programme of expenditure beingfirst submitted to the United States Minister in  Peking.BRAZIL.   On 26th October Brazil declared  war on  Germany.  Sir A. Peel reports that thePresident of the Republic in a message to Congress explained  that the last straw in       -1                            D
this case was the sinking of the  ex-German Palata]  renamed Macau, by an  enemy submarine.  Sir A. Peel has been instructed to express to the Brazilian  Governmentthe great pleasure felt by the British Government on their action in declaring war onthe side of liberty and justice.   Idle crew of the German gunboat Eber at Baiiia, before being captured, were ableseriously to damage their ship.   The Brazilian Ambassador in Washington has drawn the attention  of the UnitedStates Government to the reported military activity of the Argentine Republic which,he contends, can only be directed against Brazil.  Sir C.  Spring  Rice  learns that the ambassadors views are not shared by the State Department.                              UNITED  STATES.    Considerable interest attaches to the fact  that the United States army in france has now, as was foreshadowed in  dispatches referred to in Report  No. 35, page 14,taken over- a sector of the Western Front.    Lord Reading has advised the Prime Minister that he is trying to arrange that forthe next three months the British requirements from  the United  States Treasury willbe limited to a monthly maximum of $235,000,000, or rather more than 35,000,OOOZ.    Sir C. Spring Rice  reports that in the opinion of experts there will be a severeexhaustion, of  the supply of American cotton by September 191.8.  In consequence ofthis the War  Trade Board is anxious  for information as to the amount of cottonrequired for British  and Allied domestic needs, both civil and military, during thecoming year in order  that the cotton supply may  be controlled and  allocated forexport according to the needs of  the Allies in  the  first place, and, secondly, those neutrals.                            SHIPPING  SITUATION.   According to the War Trade  Intelligence Report, the total tonnage  of 500 tonsgross in the case of steamers and 100 tons gross in the case of sailing ships reported lost owing to  the malice of  the  King&apos;s enemies  during the period i 9th  October 25th October inclusive, is 121,767 tons,  of which 87,819 tons were British, as comparedwith 103.903 tons, of which  40,857 tons were British, reported last week.   The Trade Division of the Naval. Staff, Admiralty, estimates that the   destructionof British, Allied  and  Neutral  shipping of all sorts effected by the malice of theIviug&apos;s  enemies  throughout the  war  up  to  the end  of  September  1917, is  asfollows :                                            No. of Ships.   Tonnage.BritishAlliedNeutralTotal2,2541,0401,2244,5185,387,9961,705,1971,873,0828,906,275   In addition  to  this 1,169 British ships of 5,207,333 tons have been  attacked  bythe enemy, but not  actually sunk.  In  some cases however, ships have had to  bebeached  on  account  of their injuries, or have  been laid up for long periods pendingrepair.   Of the British ships 693 were  sunk  by torpedoes fired  without  warningfrom submarines,  and 405 others were attacked  in the same way.   The total numberof lives lost on British  ships sunk  or damaged  by the  enemy  is 8,957, but  nofigures are given  for similar losses  in  the  case of Allied  or Neutral ships.  Thesefigures show- that Allied losses have been slightly less than those of Neutrals.   According to German claims 672,000 tons of British, Allied and Neutral shippingwere sunk by submarines  during the month of September, as against 808,000 tons  inAugust.  The actual amount, according to British official figures, would  appear to  be309,217  tons for  September  as  against 401,223  tons for August.   ddie  German
^exaggeration for September therefore seems to rise to 116 per  cent, above actuality,as against an  exaggeration of  101&apos;4 per  cent, in the  case  of  the  total for August.The fact  that during September three ships of 1 6,793 tons, while not actually sunk,had to be beached in order to save them from foundering may perhaps account for therise in the percentage.    in connection with the difficulties which have arisen as to the chartering of neutral tonnage and possible competition therein between,  the  United  States and.  the  Allies,the Foreign Office points  out  to Sir  0. Spring Rice that Great Britain, France, andItaly  require for the carriage of essential foodstuffs and of material necessary for the-armies now in the field, not only all. the national tonnage in existence, but  also everyneutral ship over which British control is  sufficient to compel her to ply in the  warzone.  Even with these additional ships there  appears to be no prospect of meetingall the needs of the three Allies.    Idle Japanese Government have informed Sir G. Greene that their desire to obtain a share  of  ex-enemy tonnage  both in China and Siam was due to the  necessity for supplying the deficiency in their means of  transportation occasioned  by the sale and charter of Japanese ships.  They are, however, prepared to  make over the Japanese share in the Siamese ex-enemy ships to Great Britain provided that British approvalbe given, to their proposals for the division of the Chinese e\-enemy ships on a basis which would  allot four ships  of  11,418 tons to  Japan, four ships of 9,152 tons toGreat Britain, and two ships of 11,200 tons to  the.United  States.  (Vide  ReportNo. 35,  page 16.)  If two other ships do in fact exist, they may be added to theBritish share. Sir C. Greene learns privately that any ships acquired by Japan will.be used by the Government and not handed over to private  firms.    Mr. Barclay learns in Washington that the Japanese Government have  offered 150,000  tons  of  shipping to  the United States for immediate  delivery and a  further250,000  tons  to  be  delivered  before  September 1918, in  return, for  supply of 175,000  tons of steel (vide Report No. 39, page 16).                            PEACE  DISCUSSIONS.   Lord Bertie and Mr. Erskine report  respectively that  France  and Italy havedecided to refuse passports to persons wishing to attend the International PeaceConference in Berne (vide  Report No. 39,  page 18), and  the  Italian Minister in that capital  is endeavouring to  dissuade  certain. Italians already in  Switzerland fromcomplying with their invitations to attend.   Sir 11. Rumbold has been informed by a Zanzibari-German gentleman that thereis great hope in Germany that some bargaining at the expense of Russia may be done with regard, to &apos;.Poland and Courland as pawns in the Peace negotiations.   Marshal Hihdenburg has emphasised to a supporter in Dresden that the recovery of the German Colonies is  essential, as &quot; Our  Colonial  Possessions must first and&quot; foremost secure to us  those raw materials which are necessary for the maintenance&quot; of  our people and for war munitions which we  cannot produce at home, and. thus&quot; render us independent of the will of foreign countries.&quot;   ddie proposals of the Stockholm Socialist Conference (vide Report No. 39, page 16)have  excited the displeasure of  Bulgarians who are not  disposed to have theirambitions sacrificed just after the German Emperor has repeated his assurances thatBulgaria is to receive her national unity as a reward  for her hard and willing fight.The Press in general condemns the proposals, so far  as they affect Bulgarian ideals,as absolutely&quot; unacceptable.                                   GENERAL.   The recent Dutch Consul-General in Hamburg, Mr. Flaes, has  privately informed the British Legation at The Hague that the German authorities frequently tookportions of the food from prisoneFs parcels, and in some  cases  the whole parcel wasconfiscated and the food sold at a high price.   The British Government have asked the Dutch Minister in Berlin to find out whetherthe bayonetting of  prisoners of war  at Strohen Camp (vide Report No. 35, page 17)ceased with the dismissal of the  Commandant.
   Lord Graindlle has received a letter from Rahmi  13ey, the Yali of  Aidin, in which he-presses for the release of Eyouh  Sabri, and personally guarantees the definite-exchange of all British non-combatants in Turkey, other than the two Hadkinson&apos;s andthose who decline to be exchanged, against all Turkish civilians in the British Empire?with  a few exceptions ;  the exchange to be effected regardless of relative numbers.   Sir Id. limn bold reports that the Swiss Government are prepared to take in invalidprisoners of war selected by the Medical Commissions  in Great Britain  and germany without any limit, provided that the total number of interned to be lodged  in Swisshospitals  does not at any time exceed 35,000.  ddie Minister for  Foreign Affairsunderstands that there are now some  32,000 interned in Switzerland, but  as soon asthe Franco-German Agreement for  the repatriation  of  certain categories of prisonersbe ratified, he expects  that  10,000 French and  Germans will be affected, in which case Switzerland will be able  to accommodate a corresponding number of fresh invalidprisoners.   Owing to  tonnage and other difficulties, the British Government have advisedSir W. Townley and Sir E. Howard that the)&apos;&apos; are unable to accept the offer conveyedthrough Prince Charles of Sweden  to  accommodate British  and.German prisoners ofwar in Sweden.   Sir E. Howard points out that the suspension of the Agreement with the SwedishMedical Board will result in-the cessation of  the  transit facilities for Red Cross and medical Stores destined for Russia  and Rumania,  and suggests that, in view of this and of the fact that Sweden will not  be affected  by the embargo on such items, theAgreement should be maintained pending  the  arrangement of  a General  Agreementwdth the Swedish Government.   Sir li. Paget learns on the authority of the United States Charge cPAffaires that theRed  Cross Conference in Copenhagen (vide Report No. 35, p. 18,  and No.  39,  p. 21)has agreed to  recommend that the nationals of  the belligerents represented (Russia,Rumania,  Germany, Austria-Hungary,  and Turkey),  now  interned  in   Denmark,should  be repatriated without  delay.   Large  numbers of Russian  and  Germaninvalids  in  extensive categories are  also recommended for exchange,  ddie british naval Attache has  information to the  effect  that the  result of the  Conference  isconsidered as  a great success by the Germans, who pressed  for corn to be  speciallyimported  from America for the benefit of German prisoners in Russia, but rejected the principle that the rations issued to prisoners shmdd be proportionate to  the  food supplies in the country, asserting that they had every right   to accumulate a reserve for their  own purposes.   It  is interesting  to compare this German  anxiety to begenerous  to their prisoners in Russia  at the expense of  the  Allies with the Germanoffer recorded last week  to  export  grain and  potatoes  to  Sweden in  return  for anundiminished supply of raw materials for munitions.
