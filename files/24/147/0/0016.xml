SECRET.    APPRECIATION  OF  THE  ATTACHED  WESTERN  AND  C EN ERA L,                               REPORT,  No.  -11.                                    AUSTRALIA,   The decision of the Commonwealth Government  to take  a  second  referendum onthe question oE compulsory military service is characteristic  of Mr. Hughes&apos; refusalever to take an adverse  verdict &quot; lying down.&quot;  It is also a most significant instanceof the working of  the  referendum  principle.  - At  the fast  general election  theAustralian electorate voted for  idle  National Government on its general merits,  thequestion of conscription  having,  by consent,  been  ruled  out.  it  is  now  free  to reaffirm  or reconsider  its views on  conscription  without prejudice  to  the  generalconduct, of Australian, affairs.                         THE  ALLIED WAR CONFERENCE.   The military  situation in  Italy,  and  the  political  crisis in Russia, have  bothcontributed to complicate the arrangements  for the  long planned. Conference on theconduct of the war.   My the time it assembles it wdll have been largely superseded, bythe recognition of the  need  of some much more Intimate and permanent  method ofco-ordination of military policy.  Its main task, in fact, will be not to frame policy but to ratify decisions already taken in an emergency, and to approve of tire new  machineryof the Allied Supreme Council.  That Council is, it appears, to lie set up to deal, -with military policy only  in its broadest sense, and not with the strategy of  the  individualfronts.  Its task will presumably be to decide as to  the main functions of the  differentarmies and fronts  in the general, scheme of the war ;  the responsibility and authorityof each general staff for the operations of its own forces  on the front; allotted  to it areto remain  unimpaired.                                      FRANCE.    The continued revelations  as  to  the  under-world  of  German-fed  intrigue  areunpleasant, like the unexpected discovery  that one&apos;s kitchen is crawling with black-beetles.   But there  is nothing to suggest that  the -moral of  France,  as a  whole, isotherwise than sound and determined to sweep out all these unsavoury elements in hermidst.                              .  .       ITALY.    Public opinion continues to show itself admirably united and steady in face of  themilitary disaster.   Everything during  the next  few weeks depends on  the whole-hearted ncss with which the Allies throw themselves into  the open  breach, and  thetact with which they handle an ally who, for the moment, has become a dependent.
                                ENEMY AFFAIRS.   There are increasingly strong rumours pointing to an A us tro-German  deal, bywhich the Emperor Charles  is  lo become Xing of Poland, which would then includeGalicia,  while  Germany is  to  get her  share  by the protectorate  over a nominallyindependent  Cotirland  and  Lithuania, effectively dominated  by the direct  German.retention of the islands commanding the  Gulf of Riga.                                    GKKMASY.   Count von Hurtling seems to have rallied all but the extreme Conservatives and.Socialists in  his support as a parliamentarian who has taken office by parliamentarymethods, but  is staunchly opposed to parliamentarism,  ddie more advanced wing ofhis supporters rejoice at  the  manner of his  taking office,  the  more  conservativeconsole themselves with  extracts from  his  past  speeches.   Meanwhile, his  task ismade easier at the outset by the atmosphere of  victory in which he will make  hisopening speech.                                     JAPAN.   The Japanese-American exchange of notes,  recognising Japaibs special interest inChina, is a landmark in  international  affairs which  may stand out  some day as one ofthe chief events of the world  war.   What is of interest for us is to know  what will bethe interpretation  of  the new Japanese Monroe  doctrine as  applied to  Tibet, whereIndia is directly concerned.                                     BRAZIL.   The Presidents promptitude in  tackling German  financial and industrial control in Brazil augurs well ; it  is by far the most effective help Brazil can give the common cause at this moment.8th November 1917.L.

PART  I. BRITISH  EMPIRE  AND   AFRICA.                                    CANADA.    Writs have been issued for the General. Election to be held on. 17th December next.Idle date of the closing of the nominations is 1.9th November,  except in the YnIcon,where nominations  close on. 31st December.   The  soldiers who are  serving overseawill  begin voting   on  20th November,  and  will  continue up to and  including17th  December.  Votes cast at the front will he counted at the office  of  the CanadianCommissioner  in Paris.  All writs  are returnable  by  27th February,  and the  new parliament is summoned for 28th February.  It  is  anticipated that five  weeks willelapse between the final polling day  and the announcement of the definite result.Gwing to the grant of the franchise to  soldiers and  sailors and their female relatives,.and the disfrauchisement of aliens, a great deal of new  election  machinery has had tobe created, requiring the services of 20,000 enumerators.    Sir Wilfrid Laurier, in the course of his election address, states  that he regardsthe introduction of  conscription as a grave error.   The  fundamental  objection, to  theGovernment policy is. he says, &quot; that it is  the conscription of human life  only, and it&quot; does not attempt  to conscript the wealth resources or  services  of any persons  other&apos;&quot; than those who come within the age limit 1)1-630111)0(1 by the Military  Service Act.&quot;Sir Wilfrid announces that if returned  to  power his first  duty would be to  find  themen, money, and resources to enable Canada to continue  to  the very end  to do  hersplendid part  in the war.  He would, however, suspend the operation  of the  Military-Service Act until the people should have an opportunity of  pronouncing upon it  byway of Referendum.  Regarding the disfranohisement  of  aliens,  the liberal Leaderdescribes  the  Wartime  Election Act  as  vicious in principle.   As  to  the  economicquestion,  Sir   Wilfrid  would remove  the two  war  increases  in  the tariff,  viz.,71-  per cent,   on  all commodities coming into  Canada  from  countries  other  thanGreat Britain and  5  per cent, on goods  from Great Britain.  He would also remove the  duties on  agricultural  implements, Sec,  as  demanded  by  the Western  farmers.Sir Wilfrid declares himself in favour  of bringing under Government control  all food.producing factories in order to reduce  the cost of living, while he would, if  necessary,place the Government in control, of Factories engaged in the supply of war material inorder to prevent profiteering on war supplies.    it now  appears that Liberal candidates who support the attitude of  Sir WilfridLaurier will contest most of the Ontario seats.    There is close co-operation in the Province of Quebec in relation to the coming-elections between the Liberals  following Sir \Y. Laurier and the Nationalists under mr. Bourassa.  The latter has  been adversely criticising the motives of Great Britainand the  United States in entering the  war.    Mr. A.  L. Sifton, the Minister of Customs  in  the Union Government, has declaredthat there  has been no political, bargaining  between  the Liberals who have entered the Cabinet and Sir Robert Borneo,   lie  said.: &quot; The Liberals in the Cabinet are  not&quot; holding  out for tariff or other concessions, nor have -we made any stipulation as to&quot; the division  of portfolios.  We  simply  went into  the Government  to  serve Canada&quot; and the  Empire in the time of crisis.&quot;    It has  been practically decided that  Mr. Pardee, who was Sir W. LaurieFs ChiefLiberal Whip, will be the new Leader of the Ontario Liberals who support conscription,in  succession to Mr. N. W. Rowell.    Major Talbot M.  Papineau, M.C.,  the great-grandson of Louis Joseph Papineau(leader of  the French-Canadian  rebellion of  1837), and a  nephew  of  Mr. Bourassa(the leader of the French-Canadian Nationalists),  has  been  killed in action.  MajorPapineau was  known as a brilliant speaker, and  it was  expected that&apos;lie  would take  a prominent  part  in Dominion politics.  He  was a man of independent  views,  and while anxious  to see  Canada  as  a  free nation  within the  Empire,  he was entirelyopposed to the more restricted Nationalism of his distinguished uncle.  &apos;  ddie Admiralty have arranged,  to  transfer the old French Scutcheon, which wastaken on  18th September 1759, and  has been hitherto preserved in the NavigationSchool at Portsmouth, to  the Canadian  War  Museum.  The Admiralty express  the hope that its presentation to the Dominion archives  will be regarded  as an appropriatecommemoration  of the present association in  arms  of Canada, France  and  Great Britain.
   The returns received by the Military Service Council  relating to the period fromthe issue of the Proclamation to 1st November  show that  the  number of  men whohave registered  under the Military Service Act is 157,603.   Of these, 144,628 claimedexemption.    Owing to the Admiralty having  forbidden the  use  of  the  steamship &quot; Gorbicau &quot;for the purpose of transporting Poles  to  Prance,  the Dominion Government have represented that all  arrangements  had  been made for 1,500 Poles to&apos; embark, andthat serious international difficulties will, arise if these arrangements are upset.   TheDominion Government  have therefore requested  that the  steamship  may be used  forthe purpose named.                      AUSTRALIAN COMMON &quot;WEALTH.    ddie Commonwealth Government have decided that another referendum shall, betaken on. the subject of conscription.I    Public  meetings are being  organised, in all the States in favour of conscription.ddie Minister  for Defence (Mr. Pearce) stated in a speech  hist week that the FederalCabinet would deal at the next meeting with the general question of Australia&apos;s partin the war, and  he declared himself in favour of a measure of conscription being submitted  to the people.    The &quot;Minister mentioned that  Australia had.  up to thepresent sent 380,000 soldiers oversea.    The Parliament of the Commonwealth will, meet again on 21st November next.    ddie Prime Minister (Mr.  Hughes) has now recovered from, his recent indispositionand has announced an  important scheme for the organisation of industry.   This, hesaid, was necessary in  order to survive the economic struggle after the war.  production-tion, lie declared, was  a  national function and  it should proceed on business lines,enlist the aid of science, receive adequate financial backing, and have the  support ofthe whqle  weight  of  the  community.  In  outlining the national,  organisation for Australia lie said, there should be, first, an association representing each primary and secondary  industry;  secondly, a general. Council, of Commerce composed of repre-seiitatives from the various  associations ;  thirdly, a Department of Commerce andIndustry with a Minister at the head ; fourthly, a  Science and Industry  Bureau.;and fifthly, trade representatives for the principal oversea markets.  Air. Hughesindicated  that under  the  system he  outlined,  the expenditure would be  between250,0001. and  500,0(.)OL annually,  but that there would be no difficulty in finding themoney as the scheme was national and backed not only by the Commonwealth but by every industry.    ddie subscriptions to: the Liberty Loan total over 20,200,0002., which thus ensure its success.  In all. over 100,000,000?. have been, raised in Australia for war purposes.    A demonstration is being arranged  by the Young Ireland Party (which is underthe control of Sinn. Feiners) in  co-operation . with  the  Roman Catholic ArchbishopManhix of Victoria, in  support of Mr. De Valera.    The Commonwealth  Government  have  been asked  by  the British government whether L40U,OO0Z. in gold coin could be spared at an  early date.   Of this amount,1,000,000/. is required for the Standard Bank of South Africa, where the  position in.regard  to  specie holdings  is causing the  Union. Government much anxiety, and400,0000 is required for services connected  with military operations.  It  is  pointedout that considerations of transport make it desirable that the gold should be providedby Australia.    The Commonwealth Government have approved of the  issue of  a  badge to the wife, mother, or nearest female relative of members  of  the  Australian imperial Forceand the Naval and Military Expeditionary Force who left Australia since  4th August191.4 on active service  abroad.  For  those mothers who have  more  than  one son on active service, bars will be  attached  to  the badges,  a  bar being issued  for  everyadditional son serving.  Each badge  and bar will bear a  registered number, and  a&apos;complete record will be kept at district headquarters in each State.    The Federal Ministers have called the attention  of  the home  authorities to thefact that  certain mining companies  who, prior to the war, sold their output to foreigncompanies, and who now sell through  authorised agents in London as a result of thepolicy regarding the metal  output  adopted  by the Commonwealth Government, are faced with  a serious  position through  the British Income Tax and War Profits Tax.  &apos;1 Figures given up to 30th June 1917 showed that there  were 140,000 single men and 280,000 married men of military age in the Commonwealth who had not enlisted.         .                -
                                        yAs  the  subject  appears to the Ministers  to  be of vital  importance in relation  to imperial and Dominion trade, it is urgently requested that the  assessments  may be delayed until the receipt of a despatch which is being sent  by mail.    Regarding the suggested loan  of engines to the Rhodesian  Railways (vide ReportNo. 10), the Prime Minister of the. Commonwealth has offered an engine which  isunsuitable for work on the Tasmanian Railways.  He -also states that the Queens-land Railway  Department is willing  to sell  six locomotives  at 2,2001. each f.o.b.Brisbane.                               SOUTH AFRICA.   With regard to applications from citizens  of the United States  for  certificates  ofnaturalisation, as British subjects  under  the  South African Naturalisation  of  aliens act,  the Union Ministers have enquired whether such applications should be refusedin the absence  of  documentary evidence of the  applicants having fulfilled or beenexempted from military service in America.   With reference to the licence for  manufacture, delivery, and shipment of  goods which are ordered in the United States for export to South Africa, but, which  are onthe list of conserved articles, the Union Controller of Imports has suggested that  his recommendations  for  the  grant of  shipping space should  be taken to  include  a recommendation for permission to manufacture and for the issue of an  export licence.In this event the Controller would undertake only to make recommendations in the caseof articles destined for war purposes.   In reply to the suggestion regarding the purchase of the whole of the mohair clip(vide Report No. 40), the Union Ministers state that in view of assurances they havegiven to producers, they could not  prohibit the export to Allied countries other thanthe  United  Kingdom.   Further, a large part of the winteFs clip of the 1917-18season lias  already been sold.  Under these  circumstances the Union government cannot offer the  whole of the mohair clip, but  they believe that if  an offer  for mohairis made  on  the  same lines as that  made for  the wool  clip, nearly the whole  of.  thesummers clip of the season, and  the  unsold balance of last winteFs clip,  will be offered.   On. account of the agreements entered into on enlisting the  Members of  the SouthAfrican Native Labour Corps, the  men are  only available for  about nine  months  inFrance after the time spent en route is deducted,   ddie Admiralty consider that  theshortage of  tonnage will render  the conveyance  of  these   labourers,   and theirrepatriation  after  so  short  a time,  a matter of  serious  difficulty,  and  the ArmyCouncil have therefore  suggested  that recruiting for the Corps should not continue on the existing  terms, but that it should  be for the  duration of the war and  sixmonths afterwards.                                 GOLD COAST.   ddie Native members of the Council serving upon the Select Committee on the.Estimates for 1018 have  strongly advocated the repeal or at least the reduction of theexport duty on cocoa.  To meet the loss of revenue the Native members would, agreeto an increase of the duty on spirits.  The  Governor and.his advisers, while believing that  the reduction of the  tax will not  materially improve the position for the farmers,recommend as a matter of public policy that  the cocoa tax be  reduced from Is. 3d.  toIs. per load of GO lbs., and that the import duties on all spirits be increased hy Is. per gallon.                        PORTUGUESE  EAST AFRICA.   Notwithstanding assurances of the Portuguese  Government regarding  facilitiesfor recruiting carriers for General Northey&apos;s forces, considerable difficulties are being experienced.  Recruiting has been stopped in.  the  Nyasa Company&apos;s territory east of lake Nj&apos;asa and the  only permission that has been given is to recruit in Portuguese    4297-2                              P,
Angoniland subject, to  conditions.   The  British Consul at Lorenzo Marques reportsthat much  obstruction has been caused by the Portuguese  authorities  there  and also by  district officials, who state  that  they are  acting under the instructions of  theGovernor-General.   In Mozambique it is reported that an agitation, is being fosteredamongst the settlers against recruiting.   Only 1,200 carriers were  recruited  up to2nd November last.  A  strongly worded message has been  sent to  the portuguese government expressing the  profound disappointment of His Majesty&apos;s Government atthe dilatory and. half-hearted  assistance  given by  the  local Portuguese officials andpointing out that  the British authorities have  a  right to expect the whole-hearted support of the Portuguese in connection with the operations.  In reply the portuguese government express their surprise at the information, given and  state  that categoricalinstructions have already been, sent to the authorities in Africa.PART  II.-FOREIGN  AFFAIRS.                               ALLIED AFFAIRS.   A meeting of the  Italian,  British  and French Prime Ministers  and MilitaryDelegates  took  place  on 5th November at Papallo, when  proposals  for the closer-co-operation of all Allies on the West Front, which now runs  from the North Sea tothe Adriatic, were discussed.  The scheme under consideration has been ptit forward by Great Britain, and provides for  the  establishment  of  a  Supreme  Inter-allied council.  This is to consist of  the Prime Ministers of  the three  European  Allies,each, with  a colleague  of Cabinet rank.  The United States  will be specially repre-serited.   To begin with, these Members, who will meet  occasionally, will be assisted by a Military Staff, which will sit permanently in an Allied capital, but later on  it ishoped that similar machinery may be  set -up to enable the  Supreme Council to  dealalso with Naval, Diplomatic, Economic  and Shipping  questions.  The formation ofthis Military Staff will  not impair  the authority or affect the  responsibility of  eachChief of the  General  Staff to his own Government, but is  expected materially tofacilitate, the task of the Supreme Council in arranging  for concerted  military actionafter weighing the information laid before it by the various Chiefs of  General. Staffsthrough the  officers appointed  to  represent them  on  the permanent.Military Staff.Great Britain, France  and  Italy have appointed as their respective representatives on this  Staff General Wilson, General  Foch and General Cadprna.   Owing to internal difficulties connected with Russian party  politics  the position ofM. Tereschenko, the Minister for Foreign Affairs,  is  less assured than it  was, andSir G. Buchanan reports that he has suggested a further  postponement of the ParisWar Conference to suit  his convenience, partly because  he affects to consider  that inthe  present  circumstances Italy  will hardly  care  to send  a  representative  to theConference, partly  because be fears that the authorities of  the  Republic of  Finlandmight  arrest him on  his  way to Sweden.  An attempt  has, howrever, been made to regularise the somewhat indeterminate position of M. Skobeleff, the delegate of the petrograd Sovyet, by giving him an official appointment as &quot; Democratic Councillor &quot;to  the  Minister  for Foreign Affairs.   This would not  entitle him to give publicexpression to his views at the Conference.   In view of the Ministers misgivings,as tothe  attitude of the binlandors  he  was  at  one time  disposed, to leave by  way ofMurmansk five days later than  was originally proposed, and there  was  a  possibility that all questions as to the  status of M.  Skobeleff might be solved  by the conclusionof the  Conference before the arrival of  the  Russian Mission.  Later advices  fromPetrograd show that the Mission considers Finland less dangerous than the longer sea route from Murmansk, and Sir G-. Buchanan, telegraphing on 4th November, consideredthat  it  might after all be in time for  the Conference, but the unrest in Petrograd led the  Ambassador to retract this opinion, in his telegram on 5th November.  In any case the  Foreign  Office has assured Sir G. Barclay that the  British Government will not accept any discussion  of the SovyePs  peace programme at the  Conference, which  is to be essentially a War  Conference, and the French  Government has intimated to theRussian Minister for Foreign Affairs  that  no proposals for  the revision of War Aims will be tolerated&quot;.
.&apos;.-r.&quot;T-----    The question has arisen as to whether the Minor Allies are to he represented at -the Paris War Conference.  Lord  Bertie  reports that  the French Government doesnot propose to invite any of the Minor Allies, an opinion shared in a modified, degreeby the Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs, but Lord  Eilmarnock considers that  theBelgian Government will, be seriously offended if ignored on this occasion as it always-considers that the services  of Belgium to the Allied cause at the beginning of the warentitles her to a special position quite distinct  from that of the other Minor Allies.A suggestion  made  by M. Barthou that the  Conference  might  be postponed  onaccount  of  Italian developments is  not supported by  the  Foreign Office, which alsothinks that if M. Skobeleff comes  in an official capacity as a representative of  theRussian  Government, it will Lie difficult to exclude him, although, the French Ministerfor Foreign Affairs appears to  have,a poor opinion, of his discretion and loyalty.    With reference to the possibility of establishing a financial  blockade of Germany,Sir M. Findlay mentions that a Norwegian Bank which has been acting as receiver of-cargoes  destined for  the  enemy has, in reply to  a complaint, offered to sever allconnection with Germans  if officially requested to do so.  In asking for permission tomake this request, Sir M. Findlay states that many Norwegian  banks would abstain-entirely from. German business on the slightest  pretext.                                    FRANCE.    ddie tale of scandals in France does not appear as yet to have been told ;  the ninemillion francs supplied to Lenoir have  now been admitted by. Seholler, the Swiss  go-between, to have been  supplied from Germany ;  an inquiry has been ordered into  theassertion that M. Paix-Seailles, editor of a Pacifist journal, Le Courrier European, gaveto Almereyda of Le Bonnet Rouge  a  secret document concerning the Army of  theOrient which was communicated  to the  enemy ;  M. Daudet in JJ Action Frangaiseaccuses the  French. Secret Service of having incited troops to mutiny last May, and calls for the suppression, of the gambling rooms at Monte Carlo as  being a nest of Germanspies  protected by M. Joly ; Bolo, as well as Lenoir, has now made an application tothe President  of  the Senate for the suspension of  Senator PIumbeiFs parliamentaryimmunities  in order  that he may commence a prosecution for  embezzlement  against him ;  M. Caillaux was  confronted with  Bolo on  6th November, and  on the results ofthis meeting the question  of  suspending his  parliamentary immunities also will bedecided.;  Porchere, an  expert  accountant to the Civil Tribunal  of  the Seine, was arrested  on  6th November for having had. intercourse with the enemy as an accompliceof Bolo ; M. Monier, who  has  now resigned his position as President of the  Court ofAppeal, is  new under examination  by the Court of  Cassation ; lastly, Lord Bertiereports that  MM.  Leymarie  and Ladoux  are  upon  the point  of  being arrested.Lord  Bertie learns that the charge against the  Secret  Service is probably unfounded,but the  situation  was  so serious that the Prime  Minister  was obliged  to convokethe editors  of  all the Paris  newspapers on  3rd November  and  appeal  to  themto call a truce over political   &quot; affaires &quot; and  such-like scandals.  Lord Bertie wasalso informed  that  the  position   of  tile  Cabinet  had   been so   undermined  bythese  constant  disclosures  that it would have  collapsed had not  the Prime Ministerleft for Italy.   ddie  partisans  of  M. Clemenceau assert that the   only  cure  is aClemenceau Cabinet or one composed  exclusively of   former  Prime Ministers andpledged to probe the innumerable Bolo and cognate scandals to the bottom.   Tele-graphing on  6th November,  the  British  Ambassador reports that the  action ofM. Painleve in accusing M. Daudet of being implicated in  a Royalist plot (vide. ReportNo. 40, page 7) was  taken  in  spite of the warnings of the Ministers of Finance and justice, and the  decision   of the Examining Magistrate  in the subsequent judicialproceedings has shaken the Ministry.  Politicians are inclining  towards a ClemenceauCoalition, but difficulties are expected in making adequate provision for the politicalaccommodation of M. Thomas.    Speaking at the  Sorbonne  on  2nd  November M.  Barthou enunciated his policy towards  Germany and insisted that only in complete victory with guarantees  for future German good  behaviour and penalties for past German misdeeds was there any hope  for peace.   He  maintained that the  crimes of Germany must not be forgotten,nor allowed to  pass unavenged,  and  that punishment must  be  meted out to  thecriminals and their accomplices.  His peroration,  in which the Minister for ForeignAffairs swore not to be faithless to the French dead, who required  that France shouldexact  full vengeance and achieve complete victory,  was  loudly applauded.
s   On 3rd November the Congress of the: &quot;League of  the flights of Man &quot; passed a.resolution advocating the recovery of Alsace-Lorraine, and  the abolition of militarismand secret treaties and alliances.   OndstNovember M. Reynaudel, at  a  workmen&apos;s meeting at La  Seyne, declaredthat tire Socialists will continue to  do their duly until Alsace-Lorraine  and Trieste-have been  liberated, and  Belgium and  Serbia restored  to freedom.  M. Thomas  saidthat democracy could not afford  to let  Germany triumph, as social democracy wouldbe reduced to impotence and the  Russian  Revolution compromised by the consequent.strengthening of autocracy.                                   BELGIUM.&apos;   The Belgian Government deprecates the action proposed by Sir W. Townley as a.means whereby the  German  Administration in Belgium may be induced to modify the Language  Ordinance in  Flanders  as  tending to make the Belgian population.affected by the cessation of Belgian relief despair of their Allies and predispose themto become a prey to German propaganda (vide Report No. 40, page 7).   Lord Nihnarnock conveys the request of  the  Belgian Government that GreatBritain shordd ratify  the  Paris Protocol of 9th October on the treatment of  enemygoods  in  occupied territory,  and also support a  similar request preferred by the belgians in  Washington.                                     ITALY.   Sir  1.1.  Rodd,  who has  now returned to Rome,  telegraphing on 31st  October,considered that the spirit of the cduntry generally  was admirable, and  that the Isonzodisasters  had so fortified public &apos; opinion  and  drawn  the nation together, that if theCentral Empires were counting on an outbreak of  revolutionary agitation and panic,they would  be disappointed.   On 1st November Baron Sonnino expressed -the opinionthat the spitdt of the country was satisfactory, and  had no doubt that the people would stand firm, but dwelt upon the necessity- of heartening public opinion by promising tomaintain the supplies required for the carrying  on of the war.  On  4th november the  British. Ambassador was informed  by Baron  Sonnino  that  the  temper of  thecountry was satisfactory except  at Florence, being particularly good, in Milan,  themost important centre of  all, and  improving- in Piedmont.   Baron  Sonnino feelsconfident that the country will hold firm if the military situation can be satisfactorilyreadjusted.  Be regards the  Vatican  as hostile, but does not believe that  the Popewill   take any  active  anti-Italian  action.   lie   has  private information,  that  theClericals  are continually preaching the modern doctrine  of non-resistance,  and that foreign religious  bodies are  expressing fears  of impending revolution.    ddie Foreign Office has instructed  Sir R. Rodd to complain to the  Italian Govern-meut  that in spite  of the arrangements made, whereby Great Britain has acceptedthe financial responsibility for the orange crop, no prohibition has as  yet been issuedof the export of  lemons.   If this necessary prohibition be not immediately issued,Great Britain wdll withdraw from the Agreement (vide Report No. 38,  page 7).                                  - SERBIA.   Sir 0. des Grass learns that at the interview at Corfu between the Prime ministers of Serbia and Greece (vide Report No. 40, page 8), which took place on. 31st October,all questions common to the two countries were  discussed, and both Ministers found themselves in complete agreement as to their policy and their common  interests in the balkans.   ddie Serbian  Government has  asked to be  allowed temporarily  to  administerPodgradetz, an Albanian town near the south-western end of Lake Ochrida, pending afinal settlement at, the end of the war.   Sir C. des Graz reports  that  one reason forthis request is the fear of the Serbian Government that trouble might arise betweenthe Serbs and Italians were the latter to occupy the place.   Difficulties  have arisen  with regard to the transhipment of  Serbian troops fromArchangel en route from the Moldavian to the Macedonian front, as the local authorities,
at the request of  the French Government, have facilitated the departure of Czechs,Alsatians, and Italians in ships provided by the Admiralty for the accommodation ofSerbs only.   Lord Bertie  and  Sir  G. Buchanan have  been instructed  to  make thenecessary representations to ensure the immediate cessation of this irregularity whichis contrary to the decisions arrived at on 9th August by  the inter Allied Conference inLondon.                                   GREECE.   According to the Intelligence Bureau&apos;s report on  the economic situation in Greecemuch of the difficulty due to food shortage in Athens was caused by the deliberateaction of the Lambros  Government which distributed bread and other ration  cardsfreely to its own supporters, but ignored the needs of the rest of the. population.   Owing  to the  steps which  have  been taken by the Ottoman authorities  for theextermination of the Greek population along the Hdgean littoral  and in other parts  ofAnatolia, the Greeks of those  districts of Asia Minor  which  are  occupied  by theRussians are greatly alarmed at the possibility of again coming into the power of theTurks.   Consequently Greeks from the Black  Sea  coast  have formed a Committeewhich has  adopted a policy which  advocates a  loyal, acquiescence in Russian rule  ifTrebizonde is  to  be retained,  by  Russia,  but provides for the establishment  of anindependent Republic of Trebizondc for the  protection of the  Black  Sea Greeks  inthat  city and Ordu, Kerasunde,  and Samsun should. Russia decide to abide by herexpressed intention to annex,no new territory.   Lord Granville suggests that the eagerness of the Italians to be represented in thePort Control at Syra is connected  with their propaganda in  the Cyclades, where theyhave ousted the Austrians as  the protectors of  the  fairly numerous Roman  Catholicislanders and are alleged to be co-operating with Constantinist leaders.   Lord Granville has  been instructed to secure the adhesion  of the Greek Govern-ment to the General Blockade Policy,  and to the issue of  a list of prohibited  exports and the formation  of a Licensing Commission similar to those now functioning in theAllied  countries.   On this  the  Commercial Attaches of the Allies  could sit for thepurpose  of keeping the Greek  Government  informed as  to the Blockade Policy oftheir respective Governments and  as to the particular measures which these  desire tosee adopted in  Greece.                          ENEMY ALLIED  AFFAIRS.   ddie Neueste Nacliriehten of Munich publishes reports from Vienna  to the  effectthat the Emperor Charles will proclaim himself King of Poland and King of  a Serbiacomposed of Bosnia, the Herzegovina and the parts of Serbia to the  west of  theMorava in Austrian  occupation.  This  proclamation was expected for 4th november and the anticipated action excited the ire of the Vossische Zeitung, which saw in  thePolish part of the proposal a possible obstacle to a separate peace with Russia.   ddie Germans, according to Agents&apos; reports referred  to  by Sir II. Rumbold in,  a despatch of 8th October, are preparing to move in Moldavia during the winter.  Afterthe Allies have been driven  from Rumanian  soil, they propose  to hold  general elections as a preliminary to the establishment of a Provisional Government whichwdll at once make peace with the Central Empires.   Lord Granville reports that the  Greek Foreign Office has received assurances from switzerland  to the effect that a German-Bulgarian offensive is being prepared in  the balkans.  This is to take place a month before the Greek  mobilization is complete.   Sir E. Howard  has learned from M. Ichas, the Under Secretary  of the RussianMinistry of Education and President of the Lithuanian Conference in Stockholm, thatthe object of the Conference was to  express the unanimous demand of all Lithuaniansthat  a Lithuanian  State should be declared  independent.   Its  territories  are tocomprise part of East Prussia,  Courland and Suwalki, and  the whole of  the Russiangovernments of Vilna, Kovno  and  Grodno.  A. Provisional. Government  for internal administration  of  the country under  G-erman  occupation  has been elected, and  adecision arrived at to enter into some form of economic  union with the Scandinavian.States after the war in  order to avoid the otherwise unavoidable dependence upon.Germany.

Ichas has pressed for public Allied  recognition of theexistence  at least  of  a  Lithuanian Question  if not  of  the  Lithuanian State,   ddieForeign  Office has  instructed Sir E.  Howard  to assure Al. Ichas that Great britain is deeply interested in  the  aspirations of all the  smaller  nationalities,  and  thatLithuanian  representations will be considered in a friendly spirit.                              GERMAN AFFAIRS.    ddie appoiutment of Count von Hertling. the Bavarian Prime Minister, as Chancellorof the Empire came into effect on  1st  November, on  which day Dr. Michaelis wasrelieved of all his offices and. retired into obscurity laden with the Collar of the  hirstClass of the Order of the Red Eagle and the half-hearted encomia of a well-drilled Press.The new Chancellor, in spite of angry protests from several quarters, in one of  whichhis appointment is stigmatised as &quot; an an irreparable error,&quot; has after all been investedwith all the usual Prussian adjuncts to  the office, and on becoming Prime Minister ofPrussia ceases to direct  the Government  of  Bavaria.  The Vorwarts  asserts that thenew Chancellor submitted his person and his policy for the approval of the leaders ofthe Majority Party in the Reichstag before accepting the emperor&apos;s offer, and considersthat this fact, coupled with the fall of Dr. Michaelis, constitutes a distinct gain  for theParliamentary Sjrstem.   It  maintains that the change which has taken place in. thelast three months has gone so far  that  there can lie no return to the old Bureaucracy.ddie Berliner Neuesten Nachrichten, on the other hand, views with suspicion an appoint-ment wdiich was only rendered possible by the wholesale abandonment on the  part ofthe new Chancellor.of  political convictions dear to him  as Bavarian  Prime Minister,and deplores  the parliamentaryzation of the Government,  ddie Kreuz Zeitung takes the same line, considering that the Imperial Constitution has now begun to crumblefor the sole  benefit of  the  Social  Democrats,  but the Vossische Zeitung thinks that count von  Hertling, as being  one of the few representative Germans  who have occupied  themselves wdth foreign politics,  may perhaps restore  the  prestige of theChancellorship on  the  side  of Foreign  Affairs.   Germania  considers  that the newCdiancellor is a declared opponent  of a Parliamentary system on western lines,  ddieBerliner Borsen Courier, while calling attention  to the fact that Count von Hertlingis the first Chancellor to make his acceptance of the appointment conditional  on the previously expressed goodwill of the majority in.  the lleichstag, points out that lie willenjoy the support of a majority larger than that upon which any other Chancellor hasbeen  able  to rely.   The swiss correspondent of Le Matin, however, reports on (JthNovember that a rumour is now current in  Germany to the effect  that  Count vonHertling  only did lip-service in  his interviews with the Parliamentary leaders, andthat as Chancellor he  does not  intend,  necessarily to  conform his  policy with thewishes of the Reichstag merely on account of opinions expressed or assurances given before he took office.    With Dr. Michaelis it appears  that Herr von Heltferich and Herr von Waldowhavealso disappeared, but the Kolnisclie Zeitung  reports that Admiral von Capelle eitherrecovers, or  retains, the  Secretaryship of the Navy from which he  resigned,  being-sacrificed in  a vain attempt to save the fallen Chancellor.    Sir  W.  Townley quotes  a  German Press  report to  the effect that as  a result of visits exchanged between the new- Chancellor and the President of the Reichstag that body will meet on 22nd November, when.  Count von Hertling  will present himself and make a statement of policy.    The Intelligence Bureau, in commenting on the  public moral of  Germany, pointsout that a victorious campaign against the  Itilians  is far more likely to be popularthan one against, the Russians, as  the Italians are regarded  as traitors to  the triple alliance, but on the other hand too great  a  measure of success in Italy might againmake the question of the Temporal Power of the Pope a living issue, on which opinion in Germany  would be much divided.    Dr. llavenstein, the President  of the German State Bank, speaking at a meeting ofthe Central  Committee  of that institution,  is reported  by  the  German Wireless tohave  estimated, the amount of  new money in  the seventh. War Loan up  to 27thOctober as being 12,458,000,000 marks (normally about 022,900,000/,, but actually, atthe present international  value of  the mark, about 366,400,00OZ.)    Sir 11. Rumbold, telegraphing on 31st October,  reports the  opinions  of a SwissDoctor,Who  has just returned from inspecting  prison camps in Germany.  The Doctor
\ &apos;                                 NETHERLANDS.      Sir W. Townley reports that he has entirely failed to persuade the Dutch minister  for Foreign  Affairs that a seaplane,  even when, incapacitated  from  flying,&apos; it  hasf  navigated the North Sea like any other ordinary water-borne craft, can  be consideredI  as  a  ship.  In  consequence of this  failure the  four  British  airmen who landed atI  Flushing have  been  refused,  the  privileges accorded to  ship-wrecked,  seamen andI  have  been  interned.  The Minister for Foreign  Affairs  quotes in support  of  his  argument the internment of German airmen  from, an enemy hydroplane which cameI  into Dutch territorial waters in August 1911 ;  but  the  action  of  the Dutch may1 be  compared  with that of the Danes, who have  treated as shipwrecked,  seamen theI survivors from  the German raider which was  sunk recently by the British  in  theI Kattegat.If                                                                    -         1  asserts that no uneasiness  is ielt  as  to  the food supply, which is ample to last until  next harvest without reductions, but learns that Western Germany is greatly exercised  in mind at the prospect of  being exposed to air  raids, and thinks that the Rhineland  cities would certainly petition their Government for a cessation of  raids  in England  and France in. order to save their own skins were  they  to be much damaged,  by this  means.      In a despatch dated .15th October, Sir II. Rumbold reports the opinions of a German-  American  &quot;who left Germany  last month,  who  considers the  food  supply to be&quot; so  exiguous that the Germans cannot have laid  by enough reserves  to last until next  year&apos;s harvest, lie  considers that Pan-Germanism, though  being  much boomed at  present, is really on the wane and  confirms the statements that mutinies have taken  place at Kiel, but understands  that they were  not  on a  large  enough scale to  do much.                               AUSTRIAN AFFAIRS.      The Intelligence Bureau, referring to the internal condition  of Austria before the  repent  invasion  of Venetia,  draws attention  to  two  facts   of very considerable  importance the disintegration of  the German political parties and the consolidation  of the Czechs.  Unable to conciliate  the  divergent interests  of all  the Slav Parties,  the  Government made  concessions to the  Poles and  thus induced them to vote the  Budget, though this does not mean that the Poles have definitely  abandoned the Slav  bloc.   In this  way the position of the Government has been secured  for another four  months, and  it is  probable that the victories in Italy may depress the Slavs  in the  Reichsrath into the adoption of  a  policy of reserve for  the present.  Had  they comeI  earlier, the  victories might even have abated the vehemence  of the  Parliamentary  demand for the abolition  of the  political censorship, to  which, as it  is, the Goverh-  ment has yielded.   They are, however, unlikely materially to improve the shortage of  clothing of all sorts which is causing considerable  inconvenience and contributing to  the  spread  of tubercular  complaints in  the Army.    Unofficial financial magnates  consider that  Austria can now only save  her life  at the  price of her politicalj  independence, and  will be unable to exist-without a foreign loan,  the issues of paper  money  being  secured on less than  a 21- per cent, reserve of bullion, while the loans  concluded in  Germany for the purpose of keeping.up  the exchange exceed six times  that reserve, as they amount to 8O,OO0,O00L                              BULGARIAN  AFFAIRS.      According to information communicated by Sir 11.  Rumbold in a despatch  of 8thI  October there.is not the least likelihood, that Bulgaria will make&apos;a separate peace withI  the Allies.   But she has  now  got  most of  what she  wants and.  is  anxious to bringI  pressure on Germany to make peace.   She is displeased with her territorial agreement  with Turkey,  by  which she had  agreed to cede  Demotika  and Gumuljina  and toI  allow Turkey to  extend  into  Eastern Macedonia.   In return for this  she  was toI  receive military aid from Turkey,  while  obtaining compensation  for these territorial  sacrifices in  Western Macedonia.  Being unwilling to  retrocede her territory in theI  Lower  Maritza, Bulgaria   tried to  escape  from this  agreement, but  the  TurksJ  complained and German pressure was successfully exerted to bring her into line.
    With  reference to the suggested  reprisals on the part  of  the Government of theDutch East Indies (vide Report No. 40, page 11), Sir W. Oownley learns privately fromthe Minister  for Foreign Affairs  that the Colonial Office  knows nothing about  suchprojected  measures  and is  now  cabling to Java  on. the  subject;  furthermore, theCabinet is unanimous in deprecating  any such policy.    A correspondent  of the Tclegraaf writes from the frontier station  at  Oldenzaal todraw attention to the monstrous size  of the German  &quot;diplomatic&quot;  bags which passdaily into Germany.   He asserts that many of these bags  weigh from 12 to  18 cwt.each, and that one burst, and revealed the  fact that it contained rice.                                SWITZERLAND.    Sir Id. Run i bo id  has  been instructed to proceed with negotiations for a  separate-Swiss loan to Great Britain,  ddie terms are to provide  for advances of 12,500,000francs monthly at 5 per cent., plus I- per cent, commission, repayable in 10 years&apos; time,but it is  considered inadvisable to  establish  any  precise relationship between the monthly advances and the allocation, of  tonnage for the  benefit of  Switzerland (vide report No. 40, page 11).    The British Minister  learns that  the deliveries of German coal during Septemberwere some 20,000 tons short  of the  agreed  amount, and that a further shortage of60,000 tons will be found in the October deliveries.  In consecpience of this  there isa likelihood that Sunday train services will be suspended.                                    NORWAY.    France, at the request of Great  Britain, has agreed  to advocate in Washingtonthat the negotiations with Norway should be transferred to Christiania (vide ReportNo. 40, page II).    In view of  the  probable future  restriction  of  the Norwegian Fisheries, certain proposals are being considered, having for their object the assistance  of the fishing industry during a trying period.  These suggestions provide for alternative  schemesfor using  the Norwegian Fishing Fleet for the transport  of  fish from  Norway to theUnited Kingdom, or for patrol  purposes  under British charter,  or for  fishing  inBritish waters, with permission to land their catch in British ports.    Sir M. Findlay learns that the Norwegian Minister for Foreign Affairs will shortlymake an announcement of the first importance, and suggests that this may-  be to theeffect that Germany  has undertaken to supply Norway with necessaries.  In  view ofthis, and of the possible danger of military pressure from Sweden, due  to the revival.of Activism in that country as a result of the German victories in Italy, he is  anxious that Norway should  be informed as to the American terms before then.   The british minister suggests that the best way of doing this would be to present an Identic  Notewith-liis United States colleague  and other Allied Ministers, giving a definite written statement to  the effect that Norway will receive  rations  adequate for her  legitimaterequirements  provided  that  a  satisfactory arrangement  be  concluded with  GreatBritain and  the United States.  This would be published in the Press the same clay.                                    SWEDEN.    Sir E. Howard  reports that Swedish  newspapers  under German influence, incommenting  on Mr.  Ingleby&apos;s question  in  the House of  Commons about the wireless station in Spitsbergen, assert that it  was erected only to exchange messages with theNorwegian  Government station, and that  there is no necessity or justification forBritish intervention or concern.    Sir G. Buchanan has  been  instructed  to  press  the Russian Government veryearnestly in order to secure their prohibition of  any further export of tea to Sweden,as there is a general Allied, embargo on its export to Swedish destinations and Russiaherself is entirely dependent on imported supplies.                                   DENMARK.    ddie Foreign Office has directed Sir R. Paget to investigate the  statements  madeby a Danish Socialist deputy in the Press to the effect that the whole carcases of pigshave been exported  to Germany containing an extra stuffing of fat, much in the  same way that  pork was  illegally exported last winter to the same destination.  &apos;
                         -         .     13  A   Mr. Barclay considers  that  the  negotiations  with  Denmark have been muddledin Washington, and reports  that the  French- representative has  been  instructed toadvise a postponement of the Danish settlement until an arrangement, shall have  beenreached with Norway on the basis of the proposed declaration in Christiania.   Sir M.  Findlay reports  that  the lung-delayed  meeting  of Scandinavian PrimeMinisters is likely to take place in Copenhagen before the middle  of November.   SirE. Howard is informed that  Mr.  Branting,  the  Swedish  Minister  of Finance, willattend the Conference, as questions  connected with the gold  supply and exchangeare to be discussed.

Hardingereported that the King of  Spain was expected  to  have recourse to the  Marquess  ofAlhucemas, and next day  it was understood  that this statesman,  having  found theRegionalists, the Reformists and the Republicans too exacting, had  in turn abandoned the . task in favour of Sehor-Maura, who was consulted after  Sehor Dato had  beenfound unwilling either to withdraw  his resignation or reconstruct his Ministry.   late on  3rd  November,  whatever may  have passed in the interval,  it was announced thatthe Marquess of  Alhucemas had. after all, succeeded in forming a Coalition  Cabinetin which   all parties  except  the   Conservatives, the  Reformists   and   the  RadicalRepublicans are represented,  ddiis Administration, which has received assurances of support  from  the Conservatives, although these latter have for the  most  partdeclined to share office,  is  composed as follows :--     Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign       Affairs -----  Sehor Don GARCIA PIMETO, Marquess                                               of ALHUCEMAS, Liberal.     Minister of the Interior         -        -  Judge BAHAMONDE.     Minister of Finance     -      -      -  Sefior VENTOSA, Regionalist.     Minister of War       -       -        -  Sefior LA CIEUVA, Conservative Right.     Minister of Marine     -        -      -  Seiior GIMENO,  Romanonist Liberal.     Minister of Education         -        -  Senor  ROUES,   Regioualist  (Rallied                                               Republican)     Minister of Public Works       -      -  Sefior Don ALCALA ZAMOUA, Liberal.     Minister of Justice    -       -        -  Sehor   Don    FERNANDEZ   PRTDA,                                               Conservative Right.    ddie Foreign Office was offered  to the Marquess  of  Lema, who  refused it, and toSehor Alvarado, who resigned shortly after having accepted the appointment.    ddie new Prime  Minister, on the afternoon  of  3rd November, assured the italian ambassador, -whom he  met at the  Palace, that his  foreign policy, like that of SehorDato, would be one of strict neutrality.  In. effect, however, this was tempered  by aslight leaning towards the- Allies.  Of the new Ministers, Sir  A.  Hardinge indicatesSenores La Cierva and Zamora  as being pro-German, the latter more so than theformer, but the rest are more or less friendly to the  Allies.   Before  leaving  office,  Sefior Dato authorised the  signature of  the  commercial agreement with Great  Britain, which  provides for  the repeal  of  the Royal Decreeprohibiting the  sale of foreign, securities, and&apos; it  is believed that the new PrimeMinister will have to accept this as  an  accomplished fact.    The German Wireless  has circulated,  statements  to  the effect  that  as  the commanding Officer  of  the  German  submarine  U. B. 49 gave  no parole  bindinghimself not to escape, there has been no breach of faith in the matter.                                    JAPAN.   Sir G. Greene in a despatch dated 10th September refers to fears entertained bythe Department of the Japanese Imperial Household that the Russian Revolution mightundermine the loyalty of the people of Japan, in consequence of which the Emrierorhad been persuaded  to seclude himself in a manner reminiscent of the practice of theMikados in the  days  of  the Shogunate.  The Ambassador encloses a Memorandum by    1297-2                              D
the  British Commercial  Attache  on the same subject,  in  which,  the  views  of  animportant Japanese official are recorded,  ddie Japanese consider that the Kunaishoare completely out  of touch with the nation,  at large, and . by trying to  keep up theidea  th at His Majesty  the   Emperor  is   a  Deity are  in reality endangering hisposition,  ddie official  war films  showing  how His Majesty the King  moves  aboutamong his people were  a revelation to the Japanese public, and  the official in questionthinks  that it is a great pity that similar steps for  bringing Throne and  Peopletogether have not been  taken in Japan.   fie  added,  that many  of the  Japaneseabroad, particularly in  California, are imbued with revolutionary ideas, which theyattempt to propagate in Japan by means of the circulation  of literature of a subversivenature.  The  Japanese authorities do not appear to be particularly  efficient in  theirmethods for stopping the influx of these papers.    The Minister for Foreign Affairs has communicated  the text of the declaration ofpolicy agreed  upon between the United States and Japan as a result of the Mission of: Viscount Ishii to Washington :     ddie  Governments  of the United  States  and  Japan recognise that territorial       propinquity creates  special relations  between countries, and  eon sequent!yr the       United  States Government recognises that Japan has special interests in China,       particularly in that part to which her possessions are contiguous.  The territory       of Southern China  nevertheless remains  unimpaired and  the United  States       Government has every confidence in the repeated assurances of the Imperial       Japanese  Government  that while her geographical, position  gives Japan such       special  interests,  it has no  desire  to discriminate against  the trade of other       nations or  to  disregard commercial rights heretofore  granted  by  China in       Treaties with other Powers.    ddie  Governments  of  the United States and Japan  deny that they have  any       purpose to  infringe in any way the  independence or  national integrity of.       China, and they declare furthermore that they wdll  ahvay^s adhere to  principle       of so-called  open  door  or  equal opportunity for  commerce  and industry in       China.  Moreover, they mutually declare they are opposed  to the acquisition       by  any Government of any special  rights or privileges that would  affect the       independence or  the  territorial integrity1 of China or that would deny  to the       citizens or  subjects of any country  full enjo3&apos;ment of equal opportunity in the       commerce and industry of China.    ddie Minister for Foreign Affairs informed  the British Ambassador that  while theAgreement was satisfactory to the Japanese Government he could  not undertake to predict what the attitude of the opposition would  be.                                     CHINA.    Sir C. Greene reports that  the opinion of the Japanese Government  is favourable to the advance of  the  2,000,000L on account out  of the projected, loan for currencyreform asked  for by the Chinese Treasury (vide Report No. 40, page  16).                                  ARGENTINA.    ddie Foreign Office  has warned Sir R. Tower that instructions have  been sent tothe German Naval Attache to do  all  he can to  prevent the co-operation of Argentineshipping in the transport of the harvest to Europe, and the  British Ministerdias been directed to concert means wdth his French colleague for counteracting the&apos; manoeuvresof the German.                                  URUGUAY.    Mr. Mitchell Tunes learns  that the former German Charge d&apos;A(Taires in Montevideohas  been  instructed  to  proceed to  Chile.  He was  at one  time  Secretary  of theGerman Pegation in Santiago.                                     BRAZIL.    ddie  President of the  United States of Brazil has submitted to the King  his most grateful thanks for the gracious message sent by  His Majesty on  the occasion  of the
Brazilian declaration of war on Germany (vj.de Report No, 40, page 14).   Sir A.  Peelreports that considerable  uneasiness  as to the  intentions  of the Argentine exist  inBrazil.   The President  considers  it  to be   very  important  that  the  naval andmilitary forces of  the  Republic shoidd  be  placed in  readiness to meet  possibleunfriendly developments from that quarter.   In view of the continued activity of German submarines, which is understood  tobe connected with the espionage now so prevalent in Brazil, the British  Minister hasencouraged the  President in his proposed  action  against  enemy agents and haspressed for  it to he extended also to enemy banks and commercial houses.  Pendingsuch  action, however,  the  British Government hopes that the  United. States  willrefrain,  from  extending  premature support to any proposal put forward by Brazil forthe withdrawal of the Statutory List.   Moved  possibly by Sir A. Peeks advice, or  by the outbreak of anti-German riotsin the Federal District and at Fetropolis, the  President on 5th November  invitedCongress to authorise  him to rescind, all contracts  for  public works made with german individuals  or firms, to forbid  concessions of  land to Germans, to controlGerman banks and commercial houses, to prevent the  transfer of German propertyduring  the war, and to intern German suspects.   According to a Press telegram, the proclamation of martial law in the Federal District, was  expected  for 7th November,with General Silva Faro as Military Governor of Rio  de Janeiro.   Sir A. Peel, lias been informed  by the Minister for Foreign Affairs that PresidentBraz, in order to mark his appreciation of the solidarity  of  Brazil with Great britain in the present war,  is prepared to grant a concession to Messrs. Vickers Armstrong, orany  other similar  firm, to establish an.  arsenal for the manufacture  of arms and munitions  at  any point in  Brazil convenient to the concessionuaires.  Sir A.  Peellearns  that the Brazilian Government would, place all  its  orders with the firm  inquestion and would probably enlarge the concession  if necessary,  so as to include  init the working of ores.                                    MEXICO.   Mr. Cumin ins learns from a leader of  the  Catholic Party in Mexico  that Germanagents are particularly active among Roman Catholics and. offer to restore the political position of  the  Church as well as the  territories lost to the United States  in  1849.These promises  have had  effect  among the  more ignorant and fanatical,  but  the catholic Party  is working to counteract this propaganda.    According to other reports German agents are active in stirring up hostility to theUnited States among the garrisons and tribes of the State of  Oaxaca.   Idle British Charge d&apos;Affaires is informed that General Carranza may  shortly besuperseded in the Presidency by Sehor Iturhide (vide Report No. 39, page 1.5), who would open negotiations with the United States  as  to the conditions under which he  could obtain recognition.   Proof api^ears to have been  obtained that General  Carranza  hasintrigued, with  Germany, and that Pelaez is  to  seize Tampico where the necessaryauthorities have been bribed to facilitate the operation.   These two facts in com bin a-tion are expected to be enough to  induce  the existing President to abdicate as he  hasno powerful supporters, and German funds are beginning to  dry up.   ApparentlyGeneral  Obregon was first approached as a possible successor to General Carranza,but he was found to be too pro-German and  anti-American for the purposes of  those interested in this movement.  It is expected  that General Obregon may try to-play  alone hand,  and possibly the State of  Sonora may  make objections, but otherwise little opposition,  to the establishment of Sefior Iturbide is considered likely.                                      CUBA.   &apos; Mr. Leech reports that  all traffic  on the system of  the Cuban  Railway Comrjanywas  suspended from  27th October to 31st October owing to labour troubles.   In view,however, of the refusal,  of  the President of  the Republic to  consider  the  strikers&apos;complaints  until they had returned  to  work, the strike  came  to  an  end.   there remains  a considerable amount of industrial intimidation in the districts of Cienfuegosand Cruces, and Mr. Leech suggests that some of the United States troops now  being-trained in Cuba might be sent there to act as a sedative in these  centres of politicaland other intrigue.
                              UNITED &quot; STATES.   Mr. Hoover lias expressed  las Iwpe to Colonel  Buohan that statesmen and writersin Great Britain should avoid optimism  in public, as lie considers that a judiciouspessimism is necessary in order to save the  situation in the United States.   President  Wilson has informed  Lord Reading that he had gathered  from  con-versation with Viscount Ishii a definite impression that Japan  did  not intend to send troops into the  Russian fighting  line;  lie  was,  however,  willing to support  any representations  Great Britain  might make on that  subject,  ddie President askedwhether there was any news  as to  military preparations in Sweden, apart from, the-reported action of the  Swedish Government  in transferring  its  balances  in UnitedStates banks to other names.  Lord Reading suggested, that the President should consider the question of sending United States troops to Russia.   Lord Beading reports that the  question is now being debated in administrativecircles in Washington whether the supply of soldiers or of food and munitions is themore important to the Allies, as sufficient tonnage  cannot be  provided  to carry bothmen  and munitions  to  Europe, if the American  Army  on the west front is to bemaintained,  properly at its intended numbers.   His  Lordship  suggests  that owing tothe political value of such a step throughout the United States, every effort  should bemade to maintain the military programme, and apply tonnage to that end, even though some supplies would have to be left in America as the result.   Great stress is laid,  in a telegram to  Mr. Barclay, on  the  desirability of securingthe adoption by the United  States Government of  a policy- similar to that-elaboratedby the British Government in the  establishment  of  the Statutory List, and various reasons are  assigned.  MY. Balfour considers this policy to be  so  powerful a weaponthat the mere avowal by the United States Government of an intention to carry out a vigorous economic offensive would go far to  alarm the Germans and influence theiropinion.                             SHIPPING  SITUATION.    According to the War Trade Intelligence Report the  total tonnage of 500  tons gross in the case of steamers and 100 tons gross in the case of sailing ships  reported lost owing to the  malice of the Eing&apos;s enemies  during the  period  26th October to 1st November inclusive, is  88,669 tons, of which 58,882  were British,  as compared with  124,767 tons of which  87,819 were British reported last week.    Lord Granville gives details about a French attempt which has apparently been. made with  a certain.amount of official countenance by a certain. M. Salenson, to buy 100,000 tons of Greek shipping, on which, a douceur of 200 francs per  ton was to  be payable to the Greek ITeasury in. order  to obtain the consent of the Greek Government for the transaction,  ddie Greek. Government has declined to entertain the proposition as being contrary to what has been arranged, and has communicated withM. Venizelos on the subject of  this attempt to  secure Greek shipping for France behind  the back of the Inter-Allied Shipping Board in London.    Mr. Barclay reports  that the United States  Shipping Board is anxious to establish the principle that  all neutral tonnage, including Norwegian, should, be divided equally between the Shipping Board and  the Inter-Allied Chartering Executive, and asks forv the information necessary  for  him to advance  counter proposals, as  the American suggestions cannot be accepted.                                        s     Mr.  Barclay, the Charge de Affaires in Washington,  reports that the  United States have  agreed that  the negotiations as to the  Chinese ex-enemy ships should be con- ducted by the British Government as representing the Allies, and so sub-charter the American share of this  tonnage from the British Government.     ddie Japanese Minister for Foreign Affairs has requested  that all   future  orders given to  private shipbuilding yards in Japan by the British  Government will first be submitted for the consideration of the Japanese Government.     The President of the Bergen  Shipowners&apos; Association  having asked whether the British Government will allow friendly shipowners to contract  in  England  on  an equal basis with  British  shipowners  for post-war  deliveries of shipping,  Sir  M. Findlay has been instructed to bargain for a post-war control of two years over surplus Norwegian  tonnage in return for a grant of preferential building facilities.
                             PEACE DISCUSSIONS.    Sir H. Rumbold learns Rial Germany will be represented at the International Peace Conference in Borne by JJerren. Scheidemaim  and David, on  behalf of the Majority Socialists,  and Bernstein on behalf of the Minority Socialists, also by Professor Forster of Munich  and Dr. Fried, but Herr Erzberger is not now expected.  German agents are now active in Zurich arranging for a Press campaign in favour of the Conference.    The Kdlnische Zeitung summarises an article by  Dr. Lulves in which lie reviews the  historical  development  of war indemnities, and maintains that the territorial pledges won by the heroism  of  the German Army during this  war must  be held, in order to secure from the Allies those indemnities which, will compensate Germany for her vast sacrifices and enable  her to support  the burden  of  taxation which will come after the war.    Mr.  Gaisibrd, Charge d&apos;Affaires in  the British Legation to the Vatican, encloses in a despatch the full texts of the Bavarian, Bulgarian, and  Turkish replies to the  Papal Peace Note,   ddie King of Bavaria conceived his letter much in the same spirit  as did the  German Emperor, and  refers  to the former  peaceful  development of German economic life before the war, when :      Nothing lay further from  the minds of  the peace-loving German peoples and their       Government than the idea of an attack upon other nations or a striving after       territorial expansion  by violence,  since neither  conquest nor  acquisition of       territory could, in their eyes,  even in the remotest manner outbalance  the       dreadful horrors of war and its necessary complement the  annihilation of       &quot;cultural&quot; and  economic values.....It was  only when Germany  was       compelled to regard herself as vitally threatened and when the German peoples,       together with their loyal ally, saw themselves attacked on  all  sides, that there       remained no choice but to do battle for honour, freedom and existence ....    The Bulgarian  Tsar appears to be  particularly interested  in providing for  the freedom of the Seas as contributing to the commercial prosperity of  his country,  andis ready to support any proposal which does not conflict  with the economic interests or the political ambitions of Bulgaria.    ddie Sultan, deeply touched, by  the Papal concern for  the sufferings of humanity,is  anxious  to avoid, future  catastrophes, and regrets  that none  of the Allies has as yet offered  to make peace  on Turkey&apos;s terms, which would provide for the progressof civilisation and the welfare  of mankind.                                    GENERAL.    The Dutch Minister in  Constantinople reports  through Sir W. Townley that inview of the fact that the relief granted monthly to British prisoners of war in Turkey, d1 14, and to British Indian prisoners,  T 2, does not enable them to  cope  with theincreased cost of living, applications have been received for an  increase in the sumsgranted, and authority is asked to increase the grants  by  T I  or  T 2 per month.It should be remembered that at the present rate of exchange some  T 7 &apos; 0 paper goto  1  sterling, and  that prices in Anatolia for foodstuffs  are incredibly inflated.   Inreply the British Government has sanctioned further expenditure for the  relief ofprisoners of  war  in Turkey, but  suggests that it might be  better  to increase  the allowances of  food and  clothing instead of sending more  money (vide Report No. 38,page 20).   Lord Granville, with reference  to the letter sent by Rahmi Bey, Vali of Aidin (vide report No. 40, page 16), points out that the position of M.  Giraud and Mr. AVaugh, asnegotiators for the proposed exchange of prisoners, would be greatly  strengthened ifEyoub Sabri were on board the same ship, as  his friends in Constantinople  would be opposed to any refusal of the British demands which  might lead  to  his being&apos; sentback from Foujes to Malta.  M. GiraucTs mission is, however, not confined exclusively to negotiations concerning the exchange of prisoners.   The French Government, as a mark  of sympathy with Italy, has agreed to allow the pope&apos;s milk (vide Report No. 38, page 20) to be sent fro in Switzerland to Vienna,   ddiequestion of its distribution  can be left to the Papal Nuncio  in that  capital, who  should only be asked  to furnish details of the distribution  actually  affected to  the allied representatives in Berne.     4297-2                              h
   The Dutch Legation in Berlin has been asked to ascertain whether or no all british prisoners of war have now been  withdrawn  from Russian  territory under german occupation.   Sir R. Rodd has been informed that the Copenhagen Red Cross Conference decided in favour of the exchange of  4,000  Russian officer prisoners against 1,000 german officers who are only to  he  used administratively and  all persons deported from east Prussia.   The British Ambassador reports that this agreement is considered in rome  to be  inconsistent with the  engagements  repeatedly given  on  behalf  of theRussian Government.
              APPENDIX                      to western  and General  Report, No. 41.Nomenclature  of Political  Parties  in  the  Dominions.   It has been frequently pointed out that many who endeavour to follow the courseof political affairs in the Dominions  are confused by the fact that a Party  designationin one Dominion may be used in another Dominion to signify an entirely different set of ideas.   In order,  therefore, to  assist readers of Part I. of the  Western andGeneral Report, where the  names  of political Parties  in the Dominions constantlyoccur, a short explanation of the signification of similar Party names is given below.                                                                       O                                  CANADA,   The coalition between the  Conservatives under Sir Robert Borden and certain ofthe Liberals has resulted in the formation of a  Government which is  now termed the&quot; Union &quot; or &quot; National &quot; Government,  ddie term &quot;Union&quot;  is here used to signifya union between Parties  in  much the same way as Unionist denoted in England the combination between Conservatives and Liberals.   The &quot; Nationalists &quot; of  Canada form  the  Party  led  by Mr. Bourassa and theyconsist  of the  extreme section of French Canadians who are strongly  opposed tocloser Empire relationship, or  indeed to any action which may involve Canada in anysacrifice for the sake of  the Empire.   Their  position in relation to the  Empiredoes not  materially differ  from that of  the  &quot;Nationalists&quot; in South  Africa  (see below), but  their  attitude is  in  striking contrast to the followers  of the NationalParty in Australia who are now beginning to be termed  &quot; Nationalists.&quot;                       AUSTRALIAN   COMMONWEALTH.    When Mr. Hughes, as Prime Miuister and Leader of the  Labour Party, declaredhimself in favour of the policy of conscription for the Commonwealth, the bulk of  his supporters in the Labour Party left him.   On his subsequently forming a coalition government with the Liberals, those who  stood at the General Election in his  supportwere termed &quot; National&quot; candidates in contradistinction to their Labour opponents,and Mr. Hughes&apos; Government is now termed the &quot; National &quot;  Government.  As abovepointed out, the members of this Party, which  include  in  their ranks  the strongestpatriotic elements in Australia, are now often referred to as &quot;Nationalists.&quot;                               NEW ZEALAND.   Mr.  Massey,  as.  Leader of the Conservative  Party  in New Zealand, on findinghimself,  as  the result of  the  General Election in  1915, unable to rely  upon anindependent majority in Parliament, formed a Coalition Government wdth Sir JosephWard, the Leader  of the Liberal Party, under the name of the &quot; National &quot;  Govern-ment.  This Government was remarkable in that, by agreement between  the Leadersof the two parties, it contained an exactly equal representation  from both  sides of party politics,   ddie supporters of the Labour  Party only occupy  a few  seats inParliament.                               SOUTH  AFRICA.   The  Government of   South Africa is termed  the  &quot;Union&quot; Government, not because it consists of any combination of Parties as in Canada, for only the  followersof General Botha are represented,  but  because the &quot;Union&quot; of South Africa signifies
the constitutional combination of the various States or Provinces, whose agreement toform  a  single  Administration  was  embodied in  the  South Africa Act  of  1.909.   in short, the  word  &quot; Union,.&quot;  as  applied  to  South Africa, corresponds  to  the word&quot;Dominion&quot; as applied, to Canada and New Zealand, or &quot; Commonwealth,&quot; as applied.to Australia.  While the followers of General Botha  are termed dm  &quot; South African. &quot;.Party, the  members of the regular Opposition  are  termed &quot;Unionists&quot; (formerlyknown as &quot;Progressives&quot; both  in  Cape  Colony and  the Transvaal).   Besides hisDutch following, General  Botha  numbers  amongst  his supporters  a fair number ofmembers of  the  English-speaking  community,  who  are also represented  in  his cabinet; while the  Unionists  who  follow Sir Thomas  Smartt  are  recruited  mainly from  the English section of the population.    The &quot;Nationalist &quot; Party, led by General Hertzog,  consists  of  the extreme Dutchelement, which is anti-British in character,  and  takes up  a hostile  attitude  towardsall Empire matters.   The leaders of the Party  are against the participation, of SouthAfrica in  the  present war,  and  indeed have openly  advocated  Republicanism for south Africa.   The Party is gaining ground amongst the Dutch, as a comparison of the votes  cast at the General Election of 1.915 with those cast in the Provincial  CouncilElections this year will serve to illustrate.    The  Labour  Party  is  only  represented by six  members in  both Houses ofParliament, but this representation is hardly commensurate with the strength of theParty in the country, and particularly in the Tdansvaal.                              NEWFOUNDLAND.    A coalition  has lately taken  place  between the Conservatives (led by Sir E. Morris,the present. Prime Minister), the Liberals,  and  the .Fishermen&apos;s&apos;  Union  Party.   Thelast named corresponds  to the Labour  Party in. other countries, and before the coalition, acted with the Liberals in opposition to the then Conservative Government.The present combination is known as the &quot;  National &quot;  Government.
