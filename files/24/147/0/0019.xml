SECRET.APPRECIATION  OP. THE  ATTACHED  WESTERN&apos;  AND  GENERAL                           REPORT,  No.  44.                                    CANADA.   An attempt is apparently being made in Quebec Province to evade the provisionsof the Military Service Act by a system of wholesale exemptions.  The Government,however, are taking steps  to  ensure that  the  Act is administered both fairly andfirmly,  ddie announcement of the Minister of Militia that the bth Canadian Divisionwill  have to be  broken up and used for reinforcements, if further men are  not obtained, should  afford additional proof to the electors of  the need  of compulsory service in order to secure the additional drafts necessary for the fighting line.                           AUSTRALIAN CoilMONWEALTH.   The decision of  the Commonwealth Government to stake .their political existenceupon the result of the Conscription Referendum clearly demonstrates their conviction that  it would  be impossible for  Australia to continue to play her  part in  the warwithout the supply of the reinforcements that compulsion  alone can provide.                                    FRANCE.   On the eve of the meeting of the War Conference the French Chamber has votedthe impeachment of  M. Malvy, Minister of the Interior for the first three years of thewar.                               NORTHERS NEUTRALS.   ddie delay in settling the  details of the Blockade policy of the Allies, due to the uncertainty of American methods, has very gravely inconvenienced, this country, as, atthe recjuest of the United States, the old machinery has been scrapped, while the newhas not yet been devised.   There is some danger that  certain of  the  neutrals may be driven to conclude terms with Germany which will make  them economically vassals tothe enemy.

PART  I.-BRITISH  EMPIRE  AND  AFRICA.                             IMPERIAL  AFFAIRS.   The Governments of the Commonwealth  of Australia, Dominion of New zealand and Union of South Africa have been informed as to the proposed arrangements for future purchases in the United States.  It is pointed out that the creation of an Inter-Allied Council was considered essential by the Government of the United States so thattheir  resources might be made - available for the essential war requirements of theBritish Empire and the Allied countries ;  and in  order to co-ordinate the requirementsof the Empire the British Government have appointed a Committee in London called the American Board, presided over by Mr. Austen Chamberlain,  wdiose duty it  will beto examine all proposals  for purchase and to present them to the Inter-Allied Council.All purchases, therefore, to be henceforth  made on Government account must,  itseems to the British Government,  come through the Inter-Allied Council in Condon,and it is proposed to treat the demands from the Dominions on the  same footing asthose of the United Kingdom and subject them  to the  same test  of  urgency,  ddieprocedure to  be adopted will involve the High Commissioner presenting- the list oforders to the American Board, wdio, after examination,  --will endeavour to  secure theacceptance of the  list  by the  Inter-Allied Council.   In all cases  where a Dominionorder is considered  by the American Board  the High Commissioner will be asked to&quot;attend the meeting of the Board.                                   CANADA.    The  Prime Minister  (Sir Robert Borden) stated, in the course of his  election campaign in Ontario that he had pledged himself to  increase the number of Liberalsin the Cabinet so as to make the representation of the two  parties equal.   He alsoannounced  that  the  representation  of  Labour  in   the   Government  would  be strengthened.    The  President of the Privy Council (Mr. N. W. Rowell) has  declared that theLiberal members of the Union Government have not left their party, but that theyhave taken the best of the party with them.    When  attempting  to  address  a meeting at  Kitchener, out.  (formerly calledBerlin),  the  Prime Minister  was refused a hearing.  In a public statement subse-quently  issued, Sir R. Borden  attributed the disturbance to a few hundred  roughs.He adds, &quot; In 21 years of public life this  is the only occasion upon  which I have been prevented  from speaking  at  a meeting which I sought to  address.&quot;  Many repre-sentative men of the community have expressed their regret,  but the City  Council, inwhich there is a strong  pro-German element, decided  that no  formal apology to sir robert Borden Avas necessary.    The  Unionist Candidate for Quebec  County  (Mr. d oseph  Barnard) Avas prevented from addressing the electors at Ancienne Lorette by a  gang of ruffians Avho produced a rope and threatened to hang the candidate.    Idie  Minister  of Militia  (Major-General Mewburn), addressing a   meeting  atHamilton, announced that  the  Canadian  5th Division HOAV numbered less than 10,000men, and would probably be &quot; wiped off the slate &quot; in order to reinforce  the men inthe fighting line.   He declared that he felt  it was his  duty &quot; to get 20.000 men over- seas  by  1st  January,&quot;  and for that reason he  did  not intend to spend much timeelectioneering.  Lieutenant-General Sir II.  E. W. Turner, commanding the canadian troops in Great Britain,  has expressed to General Mewburn  the deep appreciation ofall ranks regarding the effort to  secure 20,000 reinforcements.   He  confirms  the statement that the 5th Division (which has  already supplied many drafts for reinforce-ments) will cease to exist if large fresh drafts are not immediately forthcoming.    ddie Minister of Colonisation and Immigration (Mr.  J. A. Calder) has been elected for Moose Jaw owing to  the a withdrawal of his Independent-Labour opponent.    OAving to the large number of  exemptions from  military service granted in  the City of Montreal (up to 24th. November the Boards had heard 12,345 cases  and granted
10,048 exemptions) the Prime Minister has pointed out that, where exemption is granted in an indiscriminate manner, the representatives appointed  by the Militia department will see that appeals  are lodged in  order  to prevent the intention  of  the Act beingdefeated by the default of any tribunal.  Sir IP Borden has declared the governments intention, to see the Act enforced in every Province &quot; firmly,  impartially, and fairly.&quot;Prom the figures at present available, it appears that the percentage of men ordered tojoin up  in other  parts of Quebec Province is even below that of Montreal.   TheMilitary representatives are therefore taking a large proportion of cases to the appeal tribunal.    ddie President  of the American Federation of Labour (Mr. Gompers) has announced.that the Federation will subscribe 810,000 to the Canadian Victory Loan,.    ddie British Government have informed the Dominion Ministers that an early replywill be sent to their representations regarding arrangements for enforcing compulsory military service in relation to British subjects of Canadian  birth or  domicile resident in  the  United  States, and United  States  citizens resident in  Canada  (vide ReportNo. 42).,, Meantime the British Ambassador at Washington has been asked to submit to the Dominion Government a copy of the draft agreement with the United States.As to approaching  other  Governments, the Secretary  of State for Foreign Affairssuggests that arrangements for the compulsory enlistment of aliens in Canada shouldbe limited to  States with which the British  Government have concluded MilitaryService  Conventions.  Possible exceptions  would be in  the cases of Belgium  andSerbia, as Conventions are  not  in contemplation with those countries owing to their inability to reciprocate.    The  Dominion Government have asked for the Adews of  the Admiralty upon  theprobable chances of  submarine attack on the Canadian  Atlantic coast and the methodof  defence/ that  they recommend  should be  adopted.   In   the  event  of attacksdeveloping and thus showing the intention of the enemy to continue  attempts to carryon submarine war on that side of the Atlantic, the Canadian  authorities would wishto know the Admiralty proposals,   ddie Dominion Department of Naval Service have sent Captain Martin, who is conversant with local conditions, to England, in order toconfer with the Admiralty upon the subject.    ddie  Canadian Minister  of the Interior (Mr. Arthur Meighen)  reports that  a comparison of the external trade of  the Dominion for  the first  seven months of  thecurrent - fiscal  year  with the  same months  of last   vear  shows an increase of$273,000,000.                              NEWFOUNDLAND.    ddie  United. States Shipping  Board  having prohibited the clearance of Americansailing vessels for any European or Mediterranean ports, have suggested that a similar-policy should  be  adopted regarding sailing vessels of British registry.  The New-foundland  Government have therefore  represented that no action should be takenaffecting vessels carrying Newfoundland fish to Portuguese, Spanish or Mediterraneanports without consultation with Newfoundland Ministers.  It is pointed out that thedifficulty of obtaining steam tonnage has forced the exporters to purchase  and buildlarge numbers  of sailing vessels, and that the proposed restrictions would prevent the marketing of a large proportion of the remaining Labrador and  shore catch of thepresent year.   Tdiis would have a  disastrous result, would  cause commercial failureand panic,  and  wotdd  reduce the  population  to  starvation,  ddie  NewfoundlandMinisters add  that  they  cannot  agree  to any arrangement which  will prevent the clearance of British ships from, Newfoundland ports  to the jiorts mentioned.    ddie Admiralty have informed the Newfoundland Government that on  account ofthe present naval position in  the North Atlantic, it is no longer necessary to have a naval Intelligence Centre at St. John&apos;s.  It is therefore proposed to abolish it and toreplace  it by a centre at Halifax.                      AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH.   The Prime Minister (Mr. Hughes), in a message to the Australian soldiers servingoverseas, shows that voluntary recruiting  could not be relied on to keep the Common-wealth forces up to their full strength, and points out that for September and October
last  the numbers fell  to  2,61.0  a month,  or  not  much more than,  one-half of theenlistments for February  and March.  Mr. Hughes declares, &quot; What  other  nations have done Australia must door stand dishonoured,&quot; and indicates that  his Governmentwi.il resign if they are defeated  in their proposals  for calling men up  conipulsorily.&quot;The  National Government,&quot; he  says, &quot;declares that without this power  it cannotgovern Australia and will not attempt to do so.&quot;   In  the  course of his anti-conscription  campaign, the Leader of  the Opposition(Mr. Tudor) stated that the enlistment of 383,929 men was a wonderful  achievementfor less than five millions of people situated 12,000  miles from the zorie of  war.  he observed that it cannot rightly be said that Australia is lacking in reinforcements forher five divisions, as there must be a great number of men  in  camp in  England  and.in Egypt who are available for reinforcements.   In reply to the telegram relating to the Australian Divisions  and interchange of staff (vide Report No.  42), the Commonwealth Government state  that an effort  willbe made to obtain sufficient reinforcements for five  divisions.   As to  the interchange of Staffs it  is  pointed  out that  a strong feeling  exists in the Commonwealth  that,Australian units  should be self-contained,  as the conditions of service  and personalcharacteristics of Australian troops differ from the British.   It is  further mentioned that the Imperial Conference  recommended  interchange  as between the  BritishRegular Army and  Dominion forces, and  the  Commonwealth Government  adhere tothis on the  understanding that  they are consulted  before  any exchanges are made.Subject to this it is considered that Australian  officers should,  as far as possible, formthe Staffs of the Australian formations.   With reference to the proposal that recognition should be given to the Australiansand New Zealanders who left their countries in 1914 and took part in  the  Gallipolioperations (vide Report No. 42) the Army Council have telegraphed their approval ofthe suggestion that one decoration shoidd be issued by the two Governments concerned,provided that it is confined to members of the Australian Imperial Force  and  NewZealand Expeditionary  Force.   His Majesty  the  King  has expressed his  wish  thatthe distinction  should take the form  of a  decoration rather than  a medal; and  the&apos;Ministers have  been requested to submit the design and ribbon  to His Majesty forapproval.1   The Minister for Repatriation. (Senator Milieu) has announced that he has arrangeda system in England for the repatriation, of soldiers returning  to Australia.  A list, ofnames is to be  forwarded to his Department  in the Commonwealth together with information as  to the professions or trades  which the returned men desire to resume.The Department,  will thus  be  enabled to have positions  waiting for  the men ontheir arrival.   With regard to the production of wolfram,  the Commonwealth Government have called  the attention of  the British Government to  the fact that there are many  low-grade mines in Australia which  cannot be worked profitably at, the  present price  andthat production could, be increased largely if the price were raised or  a contract for a term agreed upon.   It is added that the low-grade  mines would pay if able  to realise the prices being quoted in the United States, and the owners cannot understand  why they should not be allowed to sell to that country if the metal  is not, wanted, in. Great,Britain.  Though the Commonwealth Government have refused applications for suchsales,  it is.  they find, difficult  to justify the  refusal,   ddie position  is  thereforeproving one of embarrassment  to  the Government who  are now  engaged in the referendum campaign upon the  result of  which  they have staked their existence.   In  reply to  the request of  the British Government that the Commonwealth should provide I,40O,00OL in gold coin  for South Africa, the Australian  Ministers  state  thatthey would be glad if it could be arranged  not to press for this.  They add, however,that if South African bullion could be shipped to Australia in exchange, the Govern-ment would be prepared to make the shipment of coin.   The Commonwealth Government have telegraphed that the wool position is highlyunsatisfactory,  and their advisers express alarm that  the representatives of the UnitedStates and Allied Governments should have the right to the free selection of practicallyone-third of the Australian wool  clip, ddie procedure adopted  by the Allied repre-sentatives  last  season  created friction, and the increased allotment to the UnitedStates and the Allies causes apprehension  in. the Commonwealth as to the success ofthe scheme  and also as to the additional financial risks to the British Government.   1 A telegram in the same terms has been sent  to New Zealand, and the Governments of Canada.South Africa, and Newfoundland have been informed and asked for  any observations from  the point ofvdew of their respective forces.     4297-5                             1)
   As to the release  of.  more ships from the Australian coasting trade,  the PrimeMinister has telegraphed, that arrangements have been made to release farther vessels during the second half of December, which, together with the Indara and Canberra,will involve the withdrawal of nearly 50,QUO tons from this trade,   Though the actionalready  taken will  seriously affect the  essential  shipping  recpiirenients  of   theCommonwealth, the Ministers state they are above all things desirous of assisting  theEmpire in this great  crisis, and they will agree to release further suitable Australiancoasting vessels, if neutral tonnage can  be procured to replace them.   It is  assumed that as  a set-off against the extra cost of operating neutrals  the  Commonwealth willbe entitled, to the profits from  oversea earnings of the Australian ships  that  arereleased, though  it  is  recognised they  would  be under the control of  the british authorities.   In reply the British Government have conveyed their  great appreciation of  theoffer  of more coastal  tonnage and have promised a further reply in detail.  Mean-time  the  Prime Minister is informed of the  probable shipping situation in 19.1S.   Itis pointed out in this connection that during 1917 about GOO more ocean-going vesselswill have been lost than have been acquired, and it is estimated that the mean numberof: large British vessels working  during  1918 will,  be  less  by 150 than, during 1917,even  after making due allowance for  increased,  shipbuilding.  As these vessels wouldhave  been able to  import seven or eight million  tons, a reduction in that amount mustbe made in the imports to this country if military operations and help for Allies are tocontinue on the same scale.  It is, however, also necessary to bear  in mind  that france and  Italy will have to  import during this cereal year probably over two million tonsmore  cereals than last  year, and British tonnage, it is expected, will have to meet theseextra requirements.  In short the prospective deficit  in.  British imports as comparedwith  1917 is estimated at eight million tons.  In this case the approximate amount of foodstuffs, Avar material and. other imports which can be carried, in I 91.8 will probablybe 26 million tons as against about 31 million tons in 1917 and 45  million tons in 1916.In view of the almost  desperate  necessity, the Shipping Controller  therefore statesthat the release of further tonnage now engaged  in Australian waters  would be of  thegreatest help,  ddie need of sacrifices in this direction within the British Empire is rendered  more pressing  by  reason  of  the fact that the British Government havestrongly urged on the United States Mission now in  Europe the vital necessity ofsubordinating all commercial interests to Avar service.   ddie  Commonwealth  Government  have  represented their  desire to  be given authority to deal  with  neutral vessels which arrive in Australian ports and propose toleave in ballast or.with cargo which will  not  serve the best interests of the Empire.It is pointed out that telegrams Avere sent to the British Government recently regardingthree flagrant  cases, but no  reply was received.  It is  therefore suggested that  theCommonwealth Shipping Board should be  given  general authority to deal wdth suchneutral ships  as  may be  outside the scope of arrangements made  by  the british authorities.   Owing to the resignation of the Premier of Victoria (Sir A. Peacock) as a result ofthe defeat of his Party at the polls, the Governor has invited. Mr.  John Bowser, leader of the Economy Liberals, to form an Administration.                                NEW  ZEALAND.   Having been challenged in Parliament to resign  and contest  his seat,  the PrimeMinister (Mr. Massey) declared that  if a sufficient number of members  of  the Housewished it, he Avould not stand in the way of  a General Election, for which he  said heAvas prepared.  Idle fact, however, that the four chief centres and Wanganui returnedthe same Mayors at the last Municipal Election showed, he thought, that during thewar people did not desire  change, and he believed this applied  to Parliament.  he added that it would  be a wrong thing to hold an election now, when  the  country islighting for its existence.   At a recent meeting of  the Reform Party (formerly called the Conservative Party)a resolution was passed congratulating Mr. Massey &quot; on the valuable services rendered&quot; by him to the Empire during his  recent visit  to Great Britain, and  assuring him&quot; of its  continued lovaltv and complete confidence in him as Prime Minister  and leader&quot; of the Party.&quot;
   At the same meeting a vote of. appreciation of the work clone by Sir James Allenas Acting Prime Minister during Mr.. Massey&apos;s absence was carried with enthusiasm.   At a similar meeting of  the  Liberal  Party  it was  resolved  &quot; that this  meeting&quot; desires to pledge  its continued loyalty to Sir Joseph Ward, its leader, and wishes to&quot; leave the settlement of all matters affecting the Party to him.&quot;   Owing to the death of Dr. AleNab, Minister for Justice and Marine, it was left toSir Joseph Ward to nominate another member of the Liberal Party to succeed to that office.   It is now announced that Mr. T. M.  Wdlford  has been appointed  to  fill thevacant Ministerial post.   It is stated that JI.M.S.  Torch,  which was presented by the Admiralty io theDominion Government (vide  Report No. 26),  is to  be converted into a vessel suitablefor coastal  services in order  to replace the  llincinoa, which is being laid aside  onaccount of age.                               SOUTH AFRICA.   ddie Union Ministers  have been informed that  the  repatriation  of  non-militaryGerman  subjects from German East Africa to Germany is not practicable owing tothe shipping  position.  As,  however,  the  removal of the Germans is necessary formilitary and political reasons, the  British Government have accepted the offer of theSouth  African Government  to receive them.   Combatants and  able-bodied  maleswill be sent to Egypt for internment as  in the past.  As to detention in South-AVestAfrica, the British  Government regard  the concentration of  so large  a number ofGerman subjects  in territory recently  under German administration  with misgiving,although preferable to continued residence in German East Africa, and  they hope itmay be possible to accommodate some of the women  and children in the Union,  ddietotal number  of  persons  to be accommodated in South Africa appears  to be  1,546,of whom 745  are in the military area.   As  to the terms of recruiting for the South African.Labour Contingent (vide ReportNo. 41), the Union Government state  that  recruiting is  proceeding on. the old  termstill they have a  reply to their suggestion as to recruiting for a year&apos;s  service inEurope,   ddie Union Ministers would therefore like an early reply as to whetherrecruiting should continue on the  terms they suggest  or whether it  should  cease.Regarding the recruiting of native  convicts  (vide  Report No.  38),   the terms ofservice would  be  for the duration, of the war.   A mass meeting of the Transvaal Hindoo Association, assembled to celebrate theirgreat Dwali festival, passed a resolution requesting the British Government to  grantHome Rule to  India on the lines suggested by the Indian National Congress and theIndian Moslem League.   A. mass meeting of Jews was held at  Johannesburg on 19th November, when aresolution was carried favouring the establishment  of  a national home for Jews inPalestine and  thanking the British  Government for the  sympathy and support it had given to the proposal.                                 BASUTOLAND.   Lieutenant-Colonel Garraway,  the Resident Commissioner of the Bechuanaland.Protectorate, has been appointed Resident Commissioner of Basutoland.                        PORTUGUESE  EAST  AFRICA.   In view of the possibility of the remaining German  forces making an  effort to advance into Portuguese  East Africa,  the  British  Minister  at  Lisbon has  been instructed  to request that the Portuguese  Government should agree  both to Britishtroops crossing the Portuguese border in order to follow  the enemy, and also to the landing of British  forces on the Mozambique coast  as may be necessitated by themilitary situation.

The Acting British Consul at Monrovia states  that lie  and his French colleagueconsider that the restrictions on Liberian trade  can safely be removed.   Me points outthat the President of the Republic is desirous  of informing the Legislature  when itmeets during the first week in December that  this course  has  been taken, and it isbelieved that the proposed action would assist in meeting the growing  apprehensionregarding the financial position of the country.PART  II.-FOREIGN AFFAIRS.                               ALLIED  AFFAIRS.    On  27th November the Prime Minister, Lord Milner, Mr. Balfour, Sir E. decides, Sir John  dellicoe,  General Robertson, and  Lord Reading left London for Paris  as British representatives  on  the   War  Conference,  ddie  Prime Minister of  Italy, accompanied by Signor Nitti  (Treasury) and Signor Bianchi (Transport), left for Paris on 26th November.  Baron  Sonnino (Foreign  Affairs), who left on 25th November, Signor Cliiesa (Under Secretary for Aviation) and General Dall&apos;  Olio (Munitions) will also attend  as Italian representatives.  Japan wdll be represented by her Ambassadors in  Paris  and  London, and  Belgium, Serbia,  Portugal and  Greece  by their  Prime Ministers,   ddie Russian Ambassador in. Paris wdll also be present.    Lord Robert Cecil draws  Air. BalfouFs attention to the growing difficulties  which exist between this country and the Northern neutrals.  The situation in Switzerland and&quot; Scandinavia  is  bad,  and  owing  to the   diplomatic  delays  of the  American negotiators no definite demand can be formulated.  In  view  of this  there  is serious danger, particularly in the case  of  Sweden and  the Netherlands, that they will be driven to accept whatever terms  Germany chooses to grant, and wdll thus pass into a state of economic vassalage to that Empire.  Lord Robert presses for an arrangement to be  made in Paris whereby Great  Britain  will  be  empowered  to  conduct thenegotiations with the neutrals with  such advice and assistance as the United States may be prepared to give.    Mr.  Churchill and M. Loucheur have prepared a scheme for the co-ordination  of the manufacture of munitions  among the Allies in accordance  wdth  wdiich the War Conference  will be  invited to allocate the preparation of aero  engines and  lorries  to Italy, that of artillery railway mountings and gas to  France, and that of  aero engines and motor cars to the United States in order to  concentrate the output of these  things in the countries specially equipped for their production.    ddie French Government has  aunounced its intention of protesting against the violation of  the Franco-Russian Treaty of Alliance  by the action of  the Bolshevists in  publishing  secret agreements without the consent of  France and in  proposing an armistice.    Sir C.  Spring Rice learns that the  French Ambassador in Washington  proposed that the Allies  should  bind  themselves not to recognise  any Government in Russia except by mutual agreement  and simultaneously, but  that the State Department was unwdlling to agree as the adoption of such an attitude would certainly become known and might strengthen the hands of  the already unduly active pro-German propagandistsin Russia.
   Sir C. Greene reports that the Japanese Government considers the retention of theAllied Ambassadors in Petrograd  to  be essential for  the  present, but instructions have  been given  to the Japanese Ambassador to act when required only in such away as not to create any appearance of official recognition of the Bolshevists.   The United States Government  proposes  to make a voluntary announcement  thatit will not  fail to observe the in viola bility of  Swiss territory so long as the.neutrality of Switzerland be enforced&apos;by the Government of the  Confederation and respected bythe Central Empires.   Lord  Hugh  Cecil considers that all the Allies should  join inthis declaration.                               -    FRANCE.   On  23rd  November  the resignation  of  M. Jonnart, Minister of Blockade  andLiberated Regions, was announced.  His  successor is M. Albert Lebrmi (DemocraticLeft), who was Minister for the Colonies in the Doumergue Administration, 1913-14.Telegraphing on 23rd November, Lord Bertie announced that M. Maringer had  beenappointed Director of the Surete Generale and that M. Raux, Prefect of the Oise, hadbeen appointed Prefect of Police.   After  a  noisy  session the  Chamber appointed  a Commission  of  33  members(13  Radical  Socialists,  10  Socialists, 2 Radical  Left,  2  Republican  Socialists,3 Republican Federation, 1. Independent, and 2 others) to decide whether reasons existed.to impeach M. Malvy for crime committed in the exercise of his duties  as  Minister ofthe Interior.   On 24th November the Commission  decided that reasons for impeach-ment did exist  by 13 A-otes to 4, there being 16 absentees and abstentions.  M. Forgeotwas  elected Rapporteur  of  the Commission, and on  26th November his resolutionrecommending the  Chamber to submit the -Malvy case to the Senate for judgment wasadopted by 18 votes to 0  abstentions and  9  absentees.   On  28th November theChamber Aroted the impeachment by 512 votes to 2  after defeating a motion to refer the Report back to the Committee by 498 Amtes to 27.   Lord Bertie reports that AI. Painleve, the last Prime Minister, was examined, on26th November in connection  with  the  Paix-Seailles Affaire  about the leakage of documents concerning the Army of the Orient.                                   MONACO.   Foreign  Office  advises  Lord  Bertie  that  as  the Principality of Monaco is anindependent  State  the Military Service Agreement concluded with  France does not affect British subjects resident therein.   In view of the. possibility  that  Britishsubjects  may endeavour  to  evade military service by taking refuge in Monaco, the advisability of concluding a Military Service Agreement with the Principality is  IIOAVunder consideration.                                    ITALY.   Sir II. Rumbold learns that a great deal of German money to be applied in aid  ofa  German propaganda among Roman  Catholics  in Italy  is  being passed into  thatcountry through Swiss banks.  In connection with this, Sir R. Rodd reports a rumourto the effect that numbers of disaffected Italians Avho surrendered voluntarily on theCarso front  haA&apos;e been supplied with German money and sent  into Switzerland  tocorrupt the Italians in the Confederation.  In vieAv of this the British Government isurging Italy  to take effective measures to control and prevent such transactions.   In accordance  with the  arrangements made   Avith  the  British. Government, thespecial permission hitherto accorded for the export of citrus fruit was withdrawn on22nd November, and the Decree of 2nd January 1916 now comes into force absolutelyprohibiting such export.     4297-5                            C
   The Intelligence Bureau reports that the following gentlemen, have been appointed under Secretaries of State in Signor Orlando&apos;s Administration :    By way of  encouraging  the  nation  to -  resist,  the Corrlere  Delia  Sera  on10th  November published an  article, which has been widely reproduced  in  othernewspapers, demonstrating the dependence of Italy upon her Allies for grain and coal,arid the tonnage required  for  their transport, all of which would  be cut off  if italy were to desert them at a critical moment, and applied to their own use.   As it  is,  according to  a  letter  dated  13th  November from Sir R.  Rodd  toMr. Balfour, it seems  certain that  the supplies of  coal  to Italy must  fall duriug thewinter very far  short of the 500,000 tons which were sent monthly to Italy in the summer  and  autumn.   Signor Bianchi,  Minister of  ddansport,  calculates  upon300,000 tons for November and the same for  December, and as  the railway and  navalreserves have  been depleted, considers that the only course will be to cut off  the gasfrom, large towns, and close down almost all. the ammunition works.   The Foreign Office has notified Sir R. Rodd that the  Military Service Agreementwith Italy as amended will probably be accepted  and signed very shortly.   ddie Foreign Office informs Sir G. des Graz that, owing to its  sympathy with  theposition in which the Serbian Government is placed owing to the severe losses of  theSerbian population, the British Government  has  asked the-United  States to take overthe entire care of  Serbian  prisoners of war.  In view of this  it is hoped  that  theSerbian Government will now undertake not to  negotiate for the exchange of able-bodied prisoners of war.   Sir G. Spring Rice learns that a Military Service Agreement will probably be signedshortly between the United States and Serbia as the War Department has now realisecVthat Serbia is at war with Germany.   Lord Granville, in  a  despatch dated 30th  October,  refers to a long audiencewith Ring Alexander, who appeared to be most anxious to take an interest  in public affairs,  but  complained  of his lonely position,  ddie British Minister is of opinionthat   Count  Bosdari,  the  Italian  . Minister in  Athens, has been  exploiting theinexperience of  the  King,  and  His Majesty&apos;s  disgust  at  the  attacks  upon theRoyal Family made in the extreme Venezelist Press  to encourage animosity againstthe present Ministry..

Count Bosdarhs departure on his promotion to Madrid.   In view of the Cbnstantinisttheory that King Alexander is only Regent or locum ten ens on behalf of his absentfather, it is  interesting  to learn  that  Lord Granville considers that the King is anxious to do his duty and to &quot;play the game,&quot; and doubts his wishing to surrenderhis throne to his father or anyone else.    Sir II. Rumbold has information that the Constantinists in Switzerland propose toparticipate in the forthcoming enemy offensive  in Macedonia, which they believe will lead to the restoration of King Constantine.   This Prince, owing to illness, will not beable to share in the campaign.    Lord  Methuen has offered  to supply 15 tons  of flour monthly from Malta for thebenefit of the British community in Corfu, inasmuch as  the greater number of  these people are Maltese.    In  connection with the Later-Allied Passport Control at  Corfu, 1,01x1  Granvillereports that the Italians appear to be  raising once more the claim to passport controlover Albanians which has already met with a diplomatic rebuff  (vide Report No.  38,page &apos;.)),  Lord Granville considers  that  the proposed  procedure,  which would givetacit effect to this claim, is inadvisable owing to  the doubtful attitude of the Italianstowards the present Administration in Greece, and presses for the appointment of aGreek member in the Control.  Mr. Balfour approves of this suggestion.    ddie Italian Government has suggested  that at Greek ports where the control isentrusted to one of the three Powers, officials appointed by the other two should lieadmitted to the control as &quot; subordinate representatives,&quot; but the Foreign  Office  incommunicating  this proposal to Lord Bertie  and Lord Granville considers that itshould be resisted.    Sir R. Rodd learns that as a result of the Greek representations upon the subject,the activities of the Italian post office at  Corfu will be restricted to the handling of the correspondence only of the Italian military forces in that island.    The Prime Minister, according to General Braquet, head  of the French military mission,  has  decided that no  more Reservists are to  be  mobilised pending  the approaching regulation  of the  financial and economic situation  in  Greece  by  thePowers.                          ENEMY ALLIED  AFFAIRS.   According to information furnished by the United States Ambassador  to Russia a wireless service is now working between Petrograd and Berlin,  ddie messages circulated in this way are not to be published in the British Empire and France and Italy havebeen invited to make similar regulations, as the subject matter of these messages maybe judged from M. Trotskhs proclamation of 25th November about the denunciation of Treaties wdth the Allies :--   &quot;Soldiers,  workmen,  peasants!   Your  Sovyet will  not  permit the  Foreign       Bourgeoisie to wdiip you back to the slaughter house.   Let  them all learn that       (he soldiers, workmen,  and peasants of  Russia did not overthrow the Emperor       and the Government of Kerensky, in order to remain cannon-fodder.for Allied       Imperialists.&quot;   ddie Polish Council of Regency, which consists of Archbishop Alexander Kakow-ski,Prince Ladislaus  Lubomirski, and Joseph von Ostrowski,  en the occasion of  itsassumption of office,  addressed a long document to the  Emperors \Villiam and Charles,Avhich contains the following :           &quot;As the Council of  Regency of the Independent Polish State of the future       and the chosen representatives of  the Polish people, we offer to Your Majesty       the  expression of our  homage and  deep-felt thankfulness  for the act  of 5th       November 1916, and for the charter of  12th  September 1917.  We especially       rejoice at the  benevolent thoughts and intentions of which Your Majesty gave       expression  in the All-Highest autograph letter  of 12th September 191.7.  We       hope that the  Polish people, in the development of its history, and relying on       its own military power  and in the  pursuit of its  own  interests founded on the       bond of western culture in common  with both the Central Powers, will strive       towards political and economic aims common to them.&quot;   In view of the  postponement of the  settlement  of the Polish and Lithuanianquestions until after  the war (vide Report No. 43, page 9), it is interesting to note that
the Vorwarts, in commenting upon  the  declaration of the Government that it has noannexationist aims in the East, says :-           &quot;If it came to negotiating with Russia  ....  the German  Govern-       raent would soon realise that it could not hope to negotiate any form  of peace       but that which the- German  people  desire.   The  German people  are not       prepared to fight five minutes  in order that  Poland may become Austrian, and       Courland and Lithuania, Prussian.&quot;    Sir  II. Rumbold  learns that the Germans are  spending large sums of money inCourland, and are directing their propaganda there in such a way as to support the theory that  they are preparing for a plebiscite to declare  Courland independent ofRussia.   This  would greatly facilitate the extension of German influence  over the duchy.                              GERMAN  AFFAIRS.   On 25th November bills were introduced into the Prussian Diet, in conformity withthe Emperor Williaihs promise as Xing of  Prussia, for  the reform of the Prussianfranchise  and  of the Prussian House of Lords.  Conditions  of voting  as for theReichstag elections, but wdth a twelve months&apos; residence qualification are proposed,and twelve new seats are given to the larger  constituencies  but there is no reclistri-bution.   The House of Lords is to be increased from  387 members to 510, of whomthe King  may appoint 150 ;  and the representation of the towns and commerce is increased.   In view of this the Upper House  is to be empowered to  reject separateitems of money bills, whereas hitherto a Budget had to be accepted or  rejected as awhole.  The Liberal Democratic and Socialist Press approves of the proposals, butthe Conservatives are greatly distressed at what is taken to be the &quot; death-knell of oldPrussia,&quot; and a Conservative Party resolution  declares that electoral reform in Prussia,no less than the  Parliamentary negotiations of Count von Hertling before  takingoffice as  Chancellor, is an  encroachment  upon the rights  of  the Crown.  In con-sequence of this  Conservatives  are  called upon  to  rally to the  defence of a strongmonarchy and Federal as well as Prussian independence for    &quot;df the Imperial Government enters  the lists  of the fight for universal suffrage      backed  by Social  Democrats, Poles, and Independents,  it will  not be able to      conceal from itself that  such a  fight may end fatally for  the authority of the      State  and for  the Throne.   We beg our fellow  Deputies to use their best      endeavours that through a change  in the Prussian  Suffrage the ddirone may      not be reduced  to a  shadow of its former  self to  find as its substitute the      sovereignty of the people.                               NETHERLANDS.   The Dutch Government considers  that the fragments of  bombs picked up nearAxel and Sas  de Gand show  that  they must&apos; have  been  dropped, from  Britishaeroplanes on  the  night  of  7th-8th November, but  the British Government hasinformation which tends to make this improbable.  Sir  W. Townley, who suggestedthat an early expression of official  regret would be beneficial has, however,  beeninformed that His Majesty&apos;s Government will readily apologise and pay compensationif the responsibility should ultimately  be established.   The,  Dutch Government hasbeen asked to send, the fragments to  London for further  examination.    Idie Minister for Foreign Affairs has asked for assistance in helping  to prove acase which wdll enable the Dutch  Government to take a  firm  stand against  Germanyover the transit of gravel and sand, and has  requested  that the  documents attestingthe results of the examination of the  samples  of concrete (vide Report No. 39, page 10)may be communicated to the Netherlands  Legation in London.   He is anxious tosend, a special  commission of experts as near as possible to the German lines in belgium, in hopes of disproving that the German contention that the gravel is used only for road-making, as he realises that in the commercial interests  of  Holland thematter must be settled.
   Sir W. Towuley learns that the leakage of commercial cables into Holland  is now so considerable that an impression is gaining ground that  the British  government intends to allow a gradual resumption of the.normal facilities.   Sir W. Townley reports that according to the Butch German Economic Agreementsigned on 6th October  Germany promised  to  supply 200,000  tons per month fromGermany and 50,000 tons from Belgium as a  minimum, with a possible increase of4-0,000 tons from Germany and 10,000 tons from  Belgium.  The Dutch, however, inconsequence  of British  representations,  declined to buy  requisitioned  coal  from belgium, and none was supplied voluntarily.  In view of this the Germans are trying to make up  the deficiency from  German sources  and  have probably exceeded theGerman minimum for November.                               SWITZERLAND.    Sir .11. Rumbold learns that the existing available supplies of corn for Switzerlandcan be  made  to  last until the end  of March if the  Allies agree to increase the riceration.  In  consequence the Swiss Government is  anxious to  obtain  240,000 tonsof bread, corn  to feed the country from  April to November  1918, and greatly fearsthat if this be not forthcoming from the United States, the Central Empires will, offer to supply a  similar amount on such onerous terms that Switzerland will  be  unable  toaccept them and wdll have to starve.  The British  Minister suggests  that  he shouldbe empowered to assure the  Swiss  Government that licences for the export&apos; of thenecessary corn will  be issued by the United States Government by 1st December,and that Great Britain will help in securing the necessary tonnage.  Such assuranceswould be of value in expediting the loan negotiations.    Sir H. Rumbold. also points out that for three months there has been a shortage of30,000 tons  per month in the coal supply from Germany, which,  if maintained  at  its full figure, is 50,000 tons short of the actual requirements of the  country even  on the reduced basis, and this is causing a great drain on the coal reserves in the country.The writer of a special memorandum  circulated by  the  Intelligence  Bureau  draws attention to  this coal shortage,  which is  now  so acute that it has given rise to arumour &quot;that  Germany is  deliberately keeping the stocks of coal in  Switzerlandlow  in order to paralyze  the Swiss defence  in the  event of a German  invasion.&quot;The Chemins de Fer Federaux are said  to have enough coal to  mobilize  the  Armyfully  and transport  it to  the frontier, but not to  keep)  it supplied with food and munitions,   dd/transport, it  is  said, would  break down before stocks  of French andBritish  coal could  arrive, the Swiss  Army  would  be  paralyzed, and  the germans would inarch through.                                   NORWAY.    Sir AI. Fin lay has been advised that the delay in proceeding with, the negotiations is caused by President WilsoiFs decision that as they depend upon the exports fromthe United States they must be conducted in Washington.    ddie Foreign Office points out to Sir C. Spring Rice that the British Governmentis becoming seriously embarrassed, by the apparent deadlock in the  negotiation for ageneral agreement with Norway.   At the request of the United.. States, Great Britain.has thrown  out of gear the machinery elaborately built up for controlling Norwegianexports, and, owing&apos;*to the inaction of Washington, nothing to take its place has beenprovided.  Consequently, the Allies are  faced with the prospect of a more or lessunrestricted export of fish and metals from Norway to Germany,  ddie  Ambassador isinstructed to press upon the State Department the urgent necessity for bringing these negotiations to a head.    Sir E. Howard learns that the Queen of Sweden was unable to  go to Christianiawith King Gustavus, as such action on her part would have made it  necessary for the queen of Denmark  to accompany King Christian,  and  would thus  have strainedunduly the accommodation available in the palace of King Haakon.    Sir M. Fin lay suggests  that  as  the  threatened German  occupation of Jutland,nominally to forestall  the establishment of  an Allied  naval  base in Norway, would
almost certainly bring about such action on the part of the Allies, it is more probablethat it is a mere threat designed  to  frighten Denmark in order to compel her to useher influence at the meeting of the Kings to prevent Norway from drawing closer  tothe Allies.  The  Minister thinks Germany cannot now hold out much  longer, andhopes  to  bluff the Allies into  accepting  a peace which will  enable her  to  claim a victory for internal use, and therefore intends to play upon Scandinavian fears to that end in order to secure an economic rebuff to the Allies.                                   SWEDEN.   There is now a likelihood  that  the  negotiations between  the  Allies and Swedenwill continue to be conducted from Washington, but  the British  Government is stillanxious that the Swedish Mission should visit LondonJ although according to the most recent telegrams this is now unlikely, and has informed Sir E. Howard that full  cablefacilities will be accorded  to the  members.   The British  Government  is,  however, still attempting to get  the  Swedish  nego-tiations transferred to London for a number of good reasons, the best probably being that  the Swedish  Mission to London  wdll  be composed of  members selected by an administration  far less inimical to the Allies&apos; cause than  that  wdiich nominated therepresentatives sent to Washington.   A  hint  has been given to  the Swedish Government  that,  while  the  ForeignOffice  has  complete  trust in the integrity  of the  Swredish Minister in  London,  itsconfidence in the Legation as a whole would be increased if certain members were tobe employed elsewhere.   Sir  E.  Howard&quot;&apos;learns that  Mr.  Adlerkreutz,  formerly Swedish  Judge  in theEgyptian Mixed Court, has been appointed Secretary-General of  the  Foreign Ollicevice Mr. Westman, promoted  Minister  on the waiting list, and that  possibly CountEhrensward,  Swedish Minister  in  Berne,   and  at  one time a  Liberal  Minister forForeign Affairs, may be called in to assist in the reorganization of  the  Foreign Office.Mr. Westman wras  strongly pro-German.   In  a despatch dated  10th November Sir Esme Howard, urges  the paramountnecessity  of  arriving  at an agreement with  the Swedish  Government on  linestolerable to Sweden, as he  is  convinced   that the future  relations  of the  UnitedKingdom, with  Sweden, and  possibty wdth the other Scandinavian  countries, wdll to agreat extent depend  upon the line now taken towards the Swedish proposals for anagreement (vide Report No. 42, page 14).   The British Minister continues :           &quot; If Germany is not  militarily beaten, we shall have to fall back on our       second line of  defence against her, so as to  prevent her from  increasing her       military power in the future.   By the second line of defence I mean a  sort of       continued economic blockade of the Allied Powers against the Central  Bowers,       wdiich will prevent them from obtaining the raw  materials the)&apos;&apos; absolutely       require to build up their industries again.   The form that  I imagine such an       economic league against the Central  Powers should take is  a league of nations       for the  maintenance  of peace in the future,  which would use all economic       means to restrict the armament  and military strength of the Central Powers,       who openly base their politics on militarism and force.&quot;     - ,   With a view to increasing the economic  interests of the Allies in Sweden, for the furtherance of  the future  commercial  struggle against the Central Empires, Sir E.Howard points  out that-           &quot;... the geographical position  of Sweden makes her of great importance       to us in  the future.  I do not know  if you have personallydiacl your attention       drawn to the scheme wdtich has been under discussion for some time for  rapid       direct daily ferry service  across the  North Sea between England and Sweden,       by which we could lie placed in direct communication wdth  Russia, which       would be quite  as rapid as that which  existed overland via Germain before       the  war.  I attach the very greatest importance to the prosecution  of this       scheme, and think that His Majesty&apos;s Government and the other Allies  should       do all in their power to further it.   It might be useful to discuss this matter       with the French and American Governments.  If this scheme goes through,       Sweden wdll become our highway to  Russia, and it is of the utmost importance       that we  should keep her out of the German political orbit after the war.&quot;
   In  connection with this the Minister again, telegraphing on  21st November,emphasises the necessity oil giving some return for the concessions demanded  from sweden in order to enable the Ministry to keep in with  public opinion in the matterof passing tonnage through the Kogrund Channel.   According to Swedish Press reports the A aland Islanders have passed a resolutiondemanding the reunion of the Islands with Sweden, but when Sir E. Howard asked the Minister for Eoreign Affairs whether  any attention was being paid to the demandsof the Activist Press for the reoccupation of Finland he replied that Sweden would inno case contemplate  the occupation of any territory belonging to a friendly Power.                                    DENMARK.   In  view of  the  new  order of precedence  in dealing with the  affairs  of  the scandinavian States, the Danish question is now to be settled with the least possible delay, and the Foreign Office  learns informally  that  the Danes do  not  consider theallotment of tonnage  proposed  by the  United States  to be  aclecpiate  to  their requirements.   Sir R. Paget reports  that  in  the  counter  negotiations between Denmark  andGermany the Danes have plucked up spirit to resist German pressure manifested by increased prices for coal and iron,  and have retaliated by  demanding  more for theirbutter, bacon, and cattle.  The Germans are apparently less keen  upon  buying livehorses, and  it is feared that a great number of these wdll perish of  starvation duringthe winter  in Denmark.   On the  other  hand  they  want meat  and  fat, but thenegotiations, in  which  the G-ermans are somewhat hampered  by having to conform with their present pose as the  protectors of  Scandinavian States driven  to  starvationby the Allies, are not yet concluded.   ddie British Minister learns that arrangements comparatively favourable to Danishworkmen have been made between the  Danish and German Associated Jdades Unionsfor the purpose of tempting Danes to work in Germany.   A special bonus of 30 marksa week is to be paid to  the  wives of such men in Denmark in addition to the wages paid in Germany.                                     SPAIN.   In  a despatch dated ICth November Sir A. Hardinge reports  the  general resultsof the municipal  elections which were  held throughout Spain on 1.1th November, inwhich the Monarchists  obtained, in Madrid 38,700 votes against 17,700  given to  the republican-Socialist coalition, and writes :           &quot;... although the Monarchical parties were  triumphant, the increase in       the Republican vote,  as  compared  with previous contests, was  considerable,       and several of the members of the Revolutionary Strike Committee arrested in.       August  last,  who are now  doing penal servitude in  the  gaol of Carthagena,       were elected as councillors by the Socialists of Madrid.  It is  fair to say that       the Government avoided bringing the- usual pressure on hesitating voters,       although the  more popular and agreeable methods of  what is called here       &apos; metallic persuasion &apos;  were freely  employed  by all sides.  The Government       has now to  decide when  it  will  dissolve  the present  Cortes.  A. Liberal-       Monarchist  senator  of  strong  pro-British sympathies,  conversing with  me       yesterday, thought that if it dissolved  at once a good Monarchical majority       would  be  returned,  and  that   the present  Ministry, or another of similar       character, perhaps  under Count Romanones, might, with  some  reshuffing of       offices, govern for some time longer, but if the dissolution were deferred  the       forces  of disorder, both Republican and  pro-German, might, he feared, gain       more time to prepare their campaign.&quot;    ddie British Ambassador draws particular attention to German activities            &quot;ddie Germans, I believe, mean to utilise the innovation of &apos; free &apos; elections-       in order to spend large&apos;sums of money in promoting the return  of candidates,       whether Republican, Carlist,  or Royalist  is  all the same  to  them, wdio  will       pledge  themselves  to  support  in Parliament a Germanophile  policy and to
      paralyse a pro-Ally one on the part of any Spanish Government, and their press:      campaign is now becoming, if possible, more unscrupulous and scurrilous than      ever,&quot;and  these statements are amplified in the  report of  an audience given  by King DonAlfonso to the British Military Attache, who gave to his Majesty           &quot;... some information about a subscription which is being  raised by the      Germans here in favour of Carlist propaganda, the object  of wdiich is to foment      trouble, and, if the Germans are successful in this war, to dethrone the present      King in favour of Don Jaime,  ddie  list, which contains the names of  most of      the prominent Germans in  this town, is  headed  by their consul, his consular      seal being attached,  ddie King told me he knew  all about it, and was aware      of many other German activities.   He informed me  that the Germans  were      spending at present, in this country alone, between 7,000,000  and 8,000,000      pesetas (from 350,00UL to 400,000Z.)  a month.&quot;                                THE &apos;VATICAN&quot;.   ddie Foreign  Office has invited  Count  de SahVs opinion on the advisability of communicating to the Cardinal  Secretary of  State on the danger of an anti-Catholicoutburst in  the  United States  (vide Report  No.  42, page  18) in connection wdthpossible peace intrigues on behalf of the Central Powers.   Count de Salis reports that he has been assured that in existing circumstances theissue  of  a  further Papal Peace Note is  quite  out of the  question, and suggests thatthe rumour may  have arisen  from the fact that it is now understood that a WhiteBook  in  connection  wdth the alleged recrudescence  of  temporal aspirations  is inprepa ration.                                                     &quot;   Count de Sails reports that the Cardinal  Secretary of State has complained of the wording  of an article in The Times (3rd November), and refers to an article in the morning  Post (23rd  November), attacking  the  Pope.   The  Minister  considers thatsuch  articles militate against  British  propaganda  among  Roman  Catholics,  andsuggests  that he should disavow the articles and state that The  Times is not theorgan of  the British Government.                                    JAPAN.   Sir O. Greene learns that the following views  as  to  the  possibility of  Japanesemilitary  intervention in the West are  held  by a  very  important member  of  theCabinet.   He  considers  that -while the maintenance  of  peace in the Far East atpresent depends upon Japan, whose influence alone  prevents China  from falling intoanarchy,  national movements in  Mongolia and Manchuria might react unfavourablyon India  ; and German activity in Eastern  Siberia is to be feared in the event of aseparate  peace between Germany and  Russia, yet  Japanese  troops  will be  sent to europe in spite of tonnage or railway transport difficulties  if an  absolute  necessityfor such  action should arise.                             :   This,  however,  does not seem  to  be  the opinion of  the Minister for ForeignAffairs, who on 20th November  expressed his fears to Sir C. Greene  that the new ministry  in  France  might raise  the question  of Japanese military assistance to theAllies.   Sir C. Greene reports that Viscount Ishii returned from the United States to japan on. 26th  November, and.  that the  Minister for Foreign Affairs considered that theMission to Washington had greatly  benefited the Allied  cause  in  that it had, among other things convinced President Wilson that in spite of his suspicions Japan had nopro-German leanings.                                    CHINA.   Sir J. Jordan announces that the Prime Minister  again resigned on  23rd November,and that Wang Ta Hsieh, Minister for Foreign Affairs,  and formerly Chinese minister in London, has been appointed Acting Prime Minister.
    Sir C. Greene, however, reports that the  Japanese Minister for Foreign Affairshas  information  that  General  Tuan  may  still  resume  office  in the absence ofanyone  else  capable of taking  effective action.  The Minister is  anxious  that theAllies should show a strong front in Peking for the purpose of impressing the public and  the  President  of  the  certainty of ultimate  Allied  victory, as  President Fengmay at any moment Japse into  pro-Germanism  in view of the  vigorous pro-Germanactivities in the south.   In view of the unwillingness of the Chinese Government to deport enemy subjectswho still continue to enjoy extra territorial rights, the  Foreign Office has invited theco-operation of the  United States and. Japan in. urging upon the Government ofPeking the necessity for immediately deporting all enemy subjects from China as a preliminary to their internment in Australia.   Sir J. Jordan reports that a small one-year 7 per cent, loan of 5,000,000 yen to beapplied to Flood  Relief was arranged  between the Chinese Treasury and a syndicateof Japanese  Bankers  on  22nd  November.  In view of  the  uncertainty  of  thepolitical  situation,   the  Japanese Minister has  proposed the postponement of  the advance of the 2,000,OOOZ.  on  account of the Currency  Boan recently  approved  bvGreat Britain and Japan.                                   SIAM.   Sir II. Dering reports  that the  Siamese Government  is willing to suspend the embargo on exports to the Northern Neutrals so far as  the export of rice to the DutchFast Indies is concerned.                                 ARGENTINA.  &apos;   Sir C.  Spring Rice  learns that some  of  the  South American  Republics  have accepted the Argentine invitations to a Cougress  of Latin States on condition that thequestion of breaking  off relations with Germany  be  discussed.  In view of this theState Department is  disposed to.view the Congress favourably.   Tdhe Argentine  Minister  for  Foreign  Affairs has submitted  his  draft for anAgreement with the United Kingdom, the United States and France for the purchaseof 2,500,000 tons of  surplus wheat and  other cereals, to be exported before the end ofOctober 1918.  The draft provides for a minimum price of  $15 (paper) per 100 kilosof wheat  and  linseed and  S8 for  oats.   For the financing of this the  argentine government is ready to open a credit for 4-0,000,000?-. in the return for a  bond  forthat amount given by Great Britain and France.  The  tonnage  is to be provided bythe  Allies and  the  export of such  coal  as  the Argentine  may  require  is to be permitted.    Sir R. Tower is advised that the Wheat Commission proposes that the  argentine government should requisition the entire exploitable surplus of  wheat at any price itcan arrange with Argentine growers and sell it to the Allies at $15 ready bagged andon board ship, and should  undertake not to sell for export to anyone else except withconsent of the Allies.  In return the Allies  would supply the necessary bags.  Furtherit is pointed  out that the  credit  should be 20,000,000L each to Great Britain  andFrance and not a joint loan, and the proposal about coal is looked upon with disfavour,as hitherto the Argentine has  been aide to make its own arrangements for coal without special assistance.  The French Government  has information that a German Agent,acting apparently under the  orders of the  Gorman Naval Attache in  Madrid,  is engaged in a plot to hinder the shipments  of  Argentine grain  for the Allies and  isprepared to use explosives for the purpose.    Sir R. Tower reports that the Argentine Government will be unable to requisitionthe crop without the sanction  of  Congress, which would  take  time, as considerable opposition is to be expected.                                    BRAZIL.    Sir A. Peel reports that the Brazilian Government has invited all neutral ministers in Brazil to dismiss those of their Consular Officers who maybe of German nationality,and  has  agreed  with Peru to  accept  the  Argentine  invitation to  a Latin  Congressonly on condition that the Argentine..breaks off relations with Germany.     4-297-5                              E
IS                                    MEXICO.   Mr.  Cummins  telegraphs  that while  the  strikers in the Tampico district have returned to work  and there has been no further fighting among the oil wells, the vice--Consuls generally report that the conditions are getting worse.   An  outbreak ofanarchy is announced, from San Luis de Potosi and  General Pedaez appears to beactive in. the Panuco district.   Sir 0. Spring Rice, who has heard from Mr.  Cummins that the French. Minister inMexico  has reason to believe that the recognition of  General Carranza, who appearsto be upon the point of enforcing the new Constitution, by Great Britain and Franceis imminent, urges that the reasons  formerly advanced  against such an act are nowstronger than ever, and  hopes  that the  French Government may be persuaded  to abstain from  the  suggested, action.   ddie Ambassador adds that  AI. Simon,  of theFrench  Mission in Washington, who has  charge of the supervision of Mexican  affairs,entirely concurs wdth his protest.  It appears probable, however, that Great Britainwill copy the action of the United  States, and letters of recognition have actually been sent, although for the moment their delivery has been postponed.  Mr. Balfouradvises Sir C. Spring Rice of the  reasons which have persuaded him reluctantly totake this action in unison with France.                               UNITED STATES.   .    ddie British Government has now no  objection  to the visit of  the 69th New ATorkRegiment to Ireland en route for the West Front,  ddie regiment will land at Queenstown.    Sir  C. Spring Rice learns that the Secretary of the Treasury regards the establish-ment of machinery for  the co-ordination of all the activities of  the Allies in the prosecution of the war as  being of  the first  importance with respect to  its influence on public opinion in the United   States.  Such steps towards co-ordination  as are shown  in  the meeting of  the War Conference and  the Supreme Council enable theUnited  States Government to  assure the public that the system of co-ordinationwould  secure  results corresponding to  the  sacrifices demanded,  on behalf  of  theAllies.    Sir  0. Spring Rice reports the favourable progress  of the negotiations  for theMilitary Service Convention  which  has  been made more  far-reaching  and  simplerduring  discussion.                             SHIPPING SITUATIO N.    According to  the War Trade Intelligence Report the  total tonnage  of 500 tonsgross in the case of steamers, and 100 tons gross in the case of sailing ships, reported lost owing to the malice  of the King&apos;s enemies during the period .16th November to22nd November  inclusive is 57,085 tons,  of  which 49,176 tons were British,  ascompared  with 52,265 tons, of which 21,427 were British, reported last-week.    According  to  information communicated   to  his  Government  by the  Italian,Ambassador in Washington, there appears to be a possibility that the Dutch shippingdifficulty may be overcome  by the Dutch Government releasing all requisitionedtonnage in order that the owners may charter the vessels to American firms controlled by the  United States Government.   This would avoid  unneutral action on the part of holland which would expose the country  to German reprisals were the Dutch Govern-ment directly- to charter its own requisitioned,tonnage to a belligerent,  ddie situationis, however, not quite clear, as Sir C. Spring Rice points  out that the United StatesGovernment does not wish to put any definite demands to the Dutch.    Sir  C. Spring Rice reports that  the United States Shipping Board has prohibitedthe further purchase of enemy ships by privite individuals or companies.    In view  of  the  expressed wish, of the German Government the  Admiralty has agreed  to allow the ships to be used, for transporting prisoners  of war across theNorth  Sea to and from  Holland to  be  painted like  hospital ships in  spite of the obvious misuse of this distinctive marking.    The French  and Italian Governments  have proposed that Greek  merchantmen now on Allied service should be armed, and Lord Granville has been instructed to approach the Greek Government on the subject of  requisitioning these ships in order to defeat the objections hitherto made by certain Greek owners to the armament of their ships.    Lord Granville has been informed with reference  to M. SalensoiFs activities (vide report No. 41, page  16)  that  no escorts will  be. provided by Great Britain  for any
Greek vessels which may he sold against  the wishes of the British Government, norwill such vessels bo allowed to join convoys.    On 22nd November the German Government  announced  a  considerable extensionof the &quot; barred zone&quot; for shipping.,    The French.Government has advised Lord Bertie that as the United States Govern-ment  appears  to persist in the intention to negotiate with Uruguay on its own  behalffor ex-enemy ships, it would be better for France  to withdraw from these negotiations,as  has been  suggested  by the  United  States.   The French Government, however,awaits the  opinion of the British Government before advising the State department in this sense.    ddie Foreign Office has  advised Sir Id. Rumbold. that  the Swiss Government wdllhe  allowed  to charter enemy ships for its  own use  provided  that a  maximum of60  francs per gross  ton  be paid to the enemy  owners and  a safe conduct fee of100 francs per gross ton per month be paid to Great Britain  on behalf  of the Allies.If enemy ships be purchased by the swiss  the safe conduct  fee wdll still be payableand the ships must be resold or re-interned, at any time on the demand of the BritishGovernment.    Sir R. Peel reports that the French Government has secured the use  for one  vearof 33  ex-enemy ships (293,600 tons) for 127,000,000 francs.  The ships will be manned by Brazilian crews and will wear the Brazilian ensign and  will be employed on Alliedaccount.    Sir C. Spring Rice has been informed of the resolutions agreed upon  at a meetingof the Committee  of the  Cabinet with the United States delegates  in London to theeffect that an International Executive Committee  to control all Allied shipping  shouldnot be created, but  that both  countries  should be mutually  represented on  theirrespective Shipping Control organisations,  and providing for the co-ordination  of theemployment of Allied tonnage and for the division of neutral tonnage already accpiiredor to  lie acquired in. the future.                           &apos; PEACE DISCUSSIONS.  . ddie French and United States&quot; Governments, acting in accord  with the BritishGovernment, have declined to grant passports even  for  the proposed Allied- version of the International. Peace Conference at  Berne (vide Report No. 43, page 17), but SirII. Rumbold learns that the German Government, after carefully drilling the german delegates  as to the line they are to take, gave passports in order to impress the worldat large wdth the liberality of  the regime  in Germany.  Sir  Id. Rumbold learns thatthe Enemy version  Berne Conference refused to allow Belgian delegates to speak  asthey talk  about  the  restoration  of Belgium.  The Swiss delegates were markedlysuspicious of the  Austro-Germans, and members  admit that  the Conference has beena failure and no public report of the proceedings is to be issued.   ddie Bolshevists   in  Petrograd on  21st November  launched  proposals for animmediate armistice on  all fronts as a  preliminary to  a democratic peace  withoutannexations or contributions,  and have  invited the  co-operation of the  Europeanneutrals in communicating these proposals to the Central Empires.   Sir F.  Villiers reports that the Belgian Government have information that Austriannegotiators have  gone to Petrograd to arrange an armistice and preliminaries of peace(vide Report No.  43, page 17).   ddie British Government has  declined  to issue passports for  the  Archbishop ofUpsala&apos;s Peace Conference.                                &quot;   GENERAL.   Sir II. Rumbold reports  that Mukhtar Bey, a former Minister for Foreign affairs and reputed to be a most fanatical member of the C.U.P.,  has been, appointed chiefdelegate in the Turkish Mission to negotiate with thediritish Mission in  Switzerland,and that the Mission was due to leave Constantinople on 29th November,  ddie. objects of the Conference, as specified to the French Government, are the improvement of thetreatment of  British prisoners of war in Turkey, the exchange  of  invalid combatant
prisoners and of civilians (including French civilians  if the French Government hasno objection).   In connection  with  these  negotiations, Lord Granville reports that ameeting between  Mr. Waugh and  Rahrni Bey, Vali of Aidin, was to be arranged atFoujes for 26th November.    The Dutch Minister in Constantinople considers that the purchase of food onbehalf  of British prisoners  in Syria by the Legation is  impossible,  and that of clothing very difficult.  In view of this, he advocates an increased money allowance in order to permit of local purchases.  The German  Government announces that all british  officers and  orderlies  formerly  interned  at  Augustabad have  now  beentransferred to Schweidnitz and Idolzminden.    According  to a Vienna  Press  report, a Russian  Minister of War has ordered allAustrian and German prisoners in the Moscow district to be sent  eastwards.    In virtue of the intervention of  the King of Spain, German prisoners interned in portuguese  East Africa, where their  sanitary conditions are unfavourable, are to betransferred to the Azores.
