SECRET. &quot;APPRECIATION- OF THE-ATTACHED  WESTERN  AND  GENERALBJ      i-Ai-^nn - j ss/7J*e  :*  REPORT,  No&apos;.  28.   &apos;   &apos;                                     CANADA.   The political situation is still uncertain.  The movement for a &quot; Union &quot; Govern-ment, though strong, is evidently  unpalatable  to many convinced conscriptionists  inthe Liberal Party, over whom old  party differences  and the  immense prestige  ofSir W. Laurier still exercise a dominating influence.   The generous terms of the Soldiers&apos; Settlement Act, which gives a free grant  ofICO acres and a  loan  of  500Z. to men who have  served  in  the -British or Dominionforces, whether domiciled in  Canada or not,  and to their  widows, deserve special attention, as they will  affect the whole question of reconstruction after  the war.  Itshould be noted that the Australian policy (see Report No. 20), while different  in themethod of assistance given, viz., a gift of 500L for equipment and stocking, leaving the British Government or the individual to acquire the  land, is equally generous  inits inclusion of British as well as of Australian soldiers.                             PORTUGUESE EAST AFRICA.    The  endless  obstacles which  the Portuguese  authorities  put  in  the  way of the recruiting of carriers in their territory are having  a most injurious effect on the East African  campaign.  The root of the trouble is that Portuguese conceit prevents their admitting that recruiting done by British officers or by recognised associations like  the Wit waters rand  Native Labour Association is the only  form of recruiting that can succeed, and that recruiting  by the Portuguese  authorities  means  failure and  not infrequently rebellion.                              ALLIED ENEMY  AFFAIRS.    The Vienna &quot; FremdenblatPs &quot; reply  to L^rd  R. Cecil emphasises the point made in last week&apos;s Appreciation that Austria-Hungary and Germany must  be considered as one for  the  purposes of war or  peace.   Not only is there no possibility of Austria- making a separate peace (except by  arrangement with Germany), but she is prepared to back to the uttermost any claim, e:g.,  as regards Alsace-Lorraine,  which Germany considers vital.   The passage in the reply which  deals with Serbia shows clearly that the Austrian idea of &quot; peace without annexation &quot; d.oes not exclude effective Austrian domination  over  the  minor  Balkan  States, even  if  a nominal independence is restored to them..                                  GERMAN AFFAIRS.     The composition of Dr. Michaelis&apos;s new German Imperial and Prussian Ministries confirms  the  view expressed in  the  Appreciation to   Report. No.  2b  that,  while Bethmann-Hollweg personally had become  impossible, his policy was in substance being carried  out  by the new  Chancellor.   Broadly speaking,  the  Government of
Germany has been made more national without in any sense being parliamentarised.This corresponds to what is the average Gerrnan&apos;s ideal of government;, avMiiraistryselected by  the  Emperor which,  without being in  any  sense  controlled  by  theReichstag,  or  by  any particular  party  in  it,  is  in  reasonable harmony  with  theReichstag as a whole.  The inclusion of a Socialist and of an Alsatian in the ImperialAdministration are noteworthy features.                                 UNITED STATES.   The financial  and blockade discussions  deserve  close study.  As regards  thelatter  it is becoming  evident  that we cannot  indefinitely  pursue  the  policy  ofcarrying on arrangements with neutrals while the United States, with our consent, ineffect render those arrangements nugatory, and that we shall have either to  denounceour agreements or else secure American co-operation in making them effective.                               PEACE  DISCUSSIONS.   There  is evidently a  general hardening  all round  among the Allied Governmentsagainst the Stockholm Conference.   Even if the British Labour Conference on  thelUth should vote in favour of attendance by a small majority,  it will be very  difficult for the British Government, in view7 of the primd facie  illegality by the  proceeding,of the objection  of the other Allies, and of the possible repetition by the Seamen andFiremens&apos;  Union of  their  action  in the ease  of Mr.  MacdonakTs  proposed  &quot;visit toRussia, to lend the assistance required in order to enable that decision  to be carriedout.   Mr. IIughes&apos;s declaration that &quot; we must set our faces  against  the stockholm conference &quot; is also  a significant  indication of the point of view  of a  governmentwhose  right to be consulted in all matters affecting the  terms of peace is not  contested.   German anxiety  about  the future  supply  of raw  materials  after  the  war isevidently increasing.  It is clearly the most powerful lever we shall  have in the peacenegotiations, worth as much for  bargaining purposes as  most of the territory now inGerman occupation.               *                                                                      L.  S. A.   9th August 1917.

PART   I.-BRITISH  EMPIRE  AND  AFRICA.                                    CANADA.    On the 1st of August, the Secretaiy of  State for the Colonies transmitted to  the Governor-General certain proposals for the Minister  of  Finance, having reference to funds available  for the months of August  and September, and to  commitments on account  of the  Imperial Munitions Board  in New York.   With a  view to keeping expenses within the  limits of the resources  available, as detailed, the  Chancellor of the Exchequer proposes to curtail commitments in Canada (reducing munitions output rather than purchases of cheese), as far as possible.  The requirements of the Imperial Munitions Board for August amount to 50  million dollars, to meet  which there is a total of 30 millions available ;  he hopes to reduce these requirements by  postponement of deliveries and payments, but any  balance due would have to be  met out of  the September instalment  of the  Minister of Finance ($25,000,000) or  by  using  part of the Dominion note issue.  Replying on the  6th of  August, the  Minister  of Finance expressed his inability to  agree to these proposals, and adheres to those which were set forth in  his telegram  of  20th July (vide Reports  Nos. 25  and 27).  He  is of opinion that the British Treasury&apos;s representatives in the United States are disposed to take the line  of least resistance and to meet urgent  claims there, rather than  to meet  commitments in Canada.    The  Conscription  Bill was passed by the Senate on 4th. August by a vote of 54 to 25.  An amendment by Mr.  Bostock, proxjosing  to suspend the measure  until after  the General Election, was  rejected  by 44 votes  to 34.  Most of  the Liberal Senators supported  this amendment.  Sir  Robert Borden, in reply to a deputation on the  subject,  observed that the enemy will not  wait  for general  elections  or speeches.    The  &quot; Win the War&quot;  Movement, as shown by  the Convention at  Toronto, is clearly  in  favour  of a fusion of parties under  a National Government to enforce conscription  and carry the war to a finish.  The Convention was  attended  by 800 delegates, fairly divided  between the   political parties.  It passed resolutions  in favour of a National Government,  conscription, adequate taxation of war profits, and three months&apos; home leave and increased pay for soldiers in France.  It was opposed to a General Election during the war.   Replying to a deputation from the Convention (4th August), Sir Robert Borden said that  an  election wras inevitable, because the resolution for the extension of the life  of this Parliament was not unanimous, and it would not be right to transfer such a controversial subject to Westminster.  He expressed,the con- confident hope that  in the near future a Canadian Government would be formed, based on the union of all who, without regard to  creed, race  or party, are willing to join in a determined effort to exert the full strength, of the Dominion in winning the war.  Sir Lomer Gouin, Premier of Quebec, declares  that &quot; the present  Government has  no &quot; authority to impose conscription.  If a  majority of the people decide in favour  of it &quot; at a General  Election,  Quebec will submit.&quot;  A  meeting of editors  of Liberal newspapers in  Toronto passed a  resolution on&apos; 30th July,  recommending that the Liberal  party in the province  should pledge itself  to support  compulsory military service.  The editors also supported a policy of conscription  of wealth,  progressive income tax, control of profiteering, and nationalisation of munition works.   The Governor-General has  transmitted to the Secretary of State for the Colonies a proposal from the Chairman  of  the  Pacific Cable  Board  to  the effect that,&apos; as the Canadian Government; by their purchase  of  the  Northern Railway  system,  have presumably become owners of  the  Northern Telegraph Company and North-Western Telegraph lines, they should in all further arrangements reserve  the right to  lease such  wares in  Canada as may be required in  connection  with the  Governments Atlantic  and  Pacific  cables.  It is  suggested that the Colonial  Office and  the High. Commissioner for Canada should consult   and  communicate  with the  Canadian Government in this matter.
   The full  text of the Soldiers&apos; Settlement Act, as&apos; now passed by  the CanadianLegislature, has not yet come to hand.  From the draft of  the Act, however, it wouldappear that those entitled to benefit thereunder are the following :   &apos; (!) Honorably discharged soldiers or sailors of Canadian Forces.   (2) Those domiciled in Canada before the tear and who  were afterwards serving in          forces of Great Britain or one of her Allies.   (3) Those not domiciled in Canada and wdio served in forces  of Great Britain or          any of the self-governing BritisJi Dominions. .   .(4) Widows of above whose husbands died on active service.                      AUSTRALIAN  COMMONWEALTH.   The Governor-General of  the Commonwealth reports that the  Bill for taxing  war-profits,  recently introduced,  is intended  to  be retrospective as  from the beginningof the second year  of the war only.   The amount which the taxation is estimated to yield for that year is 400,000Z., and &quot;for the third year 5O0,0OOZ.   The Treasurers financial statement for July shows an  increase of  2S2,911Z. in theestimated customs revenue for the month, as compared with last year, the total being1,648,297Z.  There is also a Post Office increase of &apos;52,4-4-6Z.  War  pensions are rapidly growing.   The Repatriation Bill has  passed the Senate.   A. vote of  censure, moved by Mr.  Bowser in  the  State Assembly of Victoria, inthe form of an Amendment to the Address, has been  defeated by a  majority of two-votes (31  to 29).   The Government proposes  to carry on.   The Nationalist Labour Section  of the South Australian Parliament has decided toaccept the Liberal Party&apos;s offer of three seats  out of six in the Cabinet.   In opening the Tasmanian Parliament, Sir Francis Newdigate said that  11,000Tasmanians had  gone to the front.  For the settlement of repatriated soldiers,  land to the extent of 8,285 acres had been bought  at a cost of 49.499Z.   A railway  and tramway strike was started at Sydney on 2nd August.  Mr. Fuller,the Acting Premier, has issued a stirring appeal for public support of the Government-He describes  the strike  as  unjustified by any real  grievances  and engineered for political reasons by irresponsible and dangerous Trades-union leaders.   The strikers&apos;representatives held a meeting on the 3rd, and formulated an offer that the men would resume work  if  the Railway Commissioners  wotdd  revert to  the  position as on1st June, and if the Government would appoint  a Royal Commission to inquire intothe card system.   Mr. Fuller declines to withdraw the  card  system  until the men&apos;sleaders meet him to discuss the matter.   The Government of  the  Commonwealth having  enquired whether  there  is any objection  to the issue of passports to naturalised persons of enemy birth, over military age, of long residence in Australia  and undoubted integrity, the Colonial Office  havereplied stating that no objection exists to  the issue of  such passports in special cases,.at the  discretion  of  the  Commonwealth  Government, provided  there  is some validreason for the journey and that the Oversea Government concerned agrees to the issueof the passport in each case.  In *the  case  of journeys to Allied countries, it wotddbe advisable  to  submit each case to  the local  consular authority of  the  country concerned before issuing a passport.                                SOUTH AFRICA.   With reference to  the  arrangement wdiereby the military authorities propose  totransfer to East Africa the South African batteries recently  sent&apos; to  Egypt (vide lastReport) the Union  Government  have informed the Colonial  Office that the transfercannot be effected without involving the recruiting  committees in a breach  of faith,and they are therefore&apos; reluctantly compelled to request that  the batteries concernedmay be  retained for service in Egypt.  A considerable portion  of the personnel  ofthese batteries was unfitted for service in East Africa by reason of  having contractedmalaria there, and it was definitely stated, when the recruiting  for  Egypt took place;that they would not be required to serve in East Africa.
                         PORTUGUESE  EAST  AFRICA.   According to information conveyed by His Majesty&apos;s Acting Consul-General atLourenco Marques to the Goyernor of Nyasaland, the Portuguese authorities will onlypermit recruiting of carriers for General Van Deventer, and have  excluded from the authorised   recruiting  area  the  districts  of  Mozambique,  Tete,  Quelimane,  andPortuguese Nyasaland.                                   LIBERIA.   On the subject of the Liberian Governments proposed  Convention  (vide  lastReport),  Sir C. Spring Rice states that the United States Government have instructedtheir representative at Monrovia that they do not approve of it;  they consider, as doesHis Majesty&apos;s Government, that the Liberian Government  should  be satisfied with the assurances they have received.   Furthermore, they stipulate that if  a Convention ismade with England and France it should be until  the end of  the  war  only, with the proviso that any naval base that may be established shall then be  dismantled.   On 4th August His Majesty&apos;s representative at  Monrovia  reported  that  a Frenchwarship had arrived to deport all Germans thence  to France.   On the following day the Liberian Government declared war against Germany.                                       apart  II.-FOREIGN AFFAIRS,                         ALLIED  COMMON  AFFAIRS.   On 4th August, being the third anniversary of  Great Britain&apos;s entry into the war,telegrams were sent by His Majesty the King to the Sovereigns and  Presidents ofAllied countries, expressing the  unwavering  determination  of the British Empire tocarry the war to a successful conclusion.   The silk agreement continues to  be a subject of discussion  and negotiation, the swiss delegates in Paris maintaining that the proposed modification of Article 10, C. 2,would practically close the door  ou all silk exports to Germany, which would mean anend to the  swiss industry.   They ask that certain tissues which have no  military valueshould  be  allowed to pass.   The  Italian  delegate considers that  a compromise is extremely  desirable,  as failure  to  agree  with  the  Swiss would probably involveretaliatory  action on their side, with  serious consequences to Italian industry.   The Italian Ministers of Commerce and  of. the  Treasury have expressed to SirR. Rodd their serious apprehensions concerning the position in which the Italian silktrade has  been  placed by  the  complete  cessation  of  all exports to  Switzerland,conseqtient upon  the  Paris agreement.  They await with much anxiet)^ a favourablereply as to concessions remanded with regard to  existing contracts and the  establish-ment of the Head Btireau at Milan.  Unless these points are  conceded, they considerthat  it will be difficult to maintain the export prohibition.  His Majesty&apos;s Ambassadorbelieves that the Italian Government will not give way on these two questions.  Theirattitude has been  strengthened  by an  appeal addressed to them by the Italian SilkAssociation, after a meeting held at Milan on 26th July, in which stress was laid onthe clangers  of economic injury and unrest  that  must  ensue upon  maintenance of complete  prohibition.  His  Majesty&apos;s  Government   have  informed   Sir  R. Rodd(7th  August) that  they are not  impressed by the arguments adduced in justification of this attitude.   Under  the  Paris  agreement  the  Italian silk industry is guaranteedagainst all losses which it may incur by ceasing to trade with the enemy, and theseprotecting  benefits can, and should, be  made to cover &quot;existing contracts.&quot;  It is tobe observed that  the  Italian Government have not made any official proposals  to theFrench Government, or suggested any  conditions, with regard to their  ratification ofthe Paris agreement.   The French. Ambassador at Rome has now been instructed to urge that the Convention should be ratified without delay.                                   FRANCE.   Admiral Lacaze, Minister  of Marine has resigned (1st August),  being unwilling to agree that naval  operations in  the Mediterranean  should form the subject  of    3657-2                              B
enquiry by a Commission,  before which subaltern officers would give evidence, inwar  time, against their superiors.  M. Denys Cochin, Under Secretary of  State  forBlockade matters, and the only member of the Right in the Ministry, resigned on  the3rd.   He  explains his resignation on the ground that the intervention of the UnitedStates should greatly simplify blockade  questions ;  also on the ground of his familybereavements, two of his sons and a son-indaw having been killed at the front.   For the first time, no Socialist votes were given for the Government in voting  theorder of the day (passed by 363 votes against 61) on 2nd August, after an  attack byM. Renaudel, Socialist leader, on the general policy  of the Government and a vigorousreply by M. Ribot.   As M.  Thomas took office only with consent  of his party,  hisposition in the Ministry  is likely to be somewhat difficult.  The Socialist party onthe  3rd August discussed  at great  length the question of his remaining  in  theMinistry ; eventually, hy 56 votes against 9, a vaguely worded resolution was adoptedwhich left the matter to his own decision, and it is understood that he will remain.   Reporting on the  adjournment of the Chamber on 4th August, Lord Bertie says that there is expectation of  further changes in the  Cabinet before Parliament meetsagain on 18th  September.   The general parliamentary  position of the Ministry is satisfactory.  The Socialist party is suffering from divided opinions on questions ofgeneral policy.   As  regards attendance at the Stockholm Conference, it shows a disposition to temporise until the Allied Socialist Conference in London has discussed the question.   His Majesty&apos;s Government have  welcomed  the announcement of the impendingand  long-promised visit to London of M. Clementel, Minister of Commerce, and have instructed Lord Bertie to inform him that the President of the Board of Trade will beglad  to discuss specific questions with him, after he has conferred with the WarCabinet on questions of principle.  At the same  time His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador was instructed to state that, pending the discussion  of matters outstanding, His Majesty&apos;sGovernment must insist on British trade  and goods receiving in France treatment atleast as good as that extended to other Allied countries (e.rj., Italy), for it would appearthat at present all possible obstacles are being  raised  against  British trade by theFrench Government  Departments, and  this despite the  assurances  given at  thediscussions which took place last May.  Sir Austin Lee saw M. Clementel  on  8thAugust; he  deprecated  the idea that  there was any  discrimination against british trade in France.  He had requested M.  Ribot to arrange a meeting between the PrimeMinister and himself and had no doubt that matters would be speedily and satisfactorilysettled.                                    ITALY.   Baron Sonnino has taken occasion during hi? visit to London to discuss with lord robert Cecil various  questions arising out of Italy&apos;s interests in Asia Minor.   Sir R. Rodd reports that the present shortage of coal has not only prevented  theMinister of Munitions from providing the increased supplies asked for bythe militaryauthorities, but that the output of munitions has actually been  decreased by  about one-third, and. must remain thus reduced unless  means can  be  found to make good the  fuel  supply.  The question of importing  coal from  America is still underdiscussion, but as regards the suggestion that it should be brought in ships now fixedto load wheat in the  United States,  the Minister of Agriculture has pointed out toSir R. Rodd (3rd August) that under the existing compact, grain  ships from Americaare bound to carry grain to England, in exchange for which Italy receives grain from india.                                   BELGIUM.    Baron de Broqueville, while  retaining his  position as Prime Minister, has beenappointed Minister for Foreign Affairs,  and has  been succeeded at the War Office byGeneral Ceuninck.  A War Committee of the Cabinet has been formed, of which theBelgian Minister in London is a member.    The United States Government have officially proposed to the Norwegian  Govern-ment (and are  prepared  to  do so in the case of  Holland) that  if the  norwegian government will cede to the Belgian Relief Commission two-thirds  of the wheat  and flour loaded for Norway in United States ports, export licenses will  be issued for theremaining third to be shipped to Norway.
    The &quot; Weser Zeitung &quot; of 5th August publishes a letter from a Flemish Activist tothe Berlin historian Dr. Meinecke, in which are set forth the best and quickest means for dividing Belgium and  for giving the Flemish element (supported by  Germany)-control over the Walloons.  He considers that this result is to be attained by a  peacewhich would restore to Belgium her former frontiers but condemn  her to  permanentweakness  and neutrality  by the reduction of her  army and  the  loss of  the Congo,while  the language  question  would be decided   by  partition inside the  old  state system.    The delay of the United States Government in deciding as  to its participation inthe financing  of the Belgian Government has led to no little  difficulty  and  to com-plications between the British, French, and  Belgian  Governments, whose plans are necessarily affected by the uncertainty thus  created. The Belgian Minister of Financehas come to London on 8th August, to make personal representations  on the subjectof the serious difficulties of his position, resulting from the delay which  has occurred in  the matter of the fifth joint loan  to  Belgium.  His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador atWashington has been instructed to urge the United States Government to come  to anearly decision.                                    GREECE.    On the subject of the proposed financial assistance to Greece, the views of the British Treasury have been communicated  to the  French Government, together with. the suggestion that the sum of 200,000,000 drachmas  is more than  should be asked for  in the first  instance, as provision had already  been made&quot; for  the cost of the Provisional Government  and of the .1915  mobilisation.  The  Treasury suggest that, for  the present, half the  amount  named  should be  the  maximum.  Regarding the book credit, they consider that the  Greek Government should be informed that it cannot be drawn upon  in  cash, and that it will be cancelled one j-ear after the-conclusion of peace.   As to future expenses, the  Treasury would not wish to under- table  any financial responsibilities for such expenditure as may be incurred by the French Government  in Grreece, except in cases where special  arrangements are made to  that effect.  Thej7 also consider  that the financial  assistance  now proposed should be conditional upon the  Greek Government  assuming formal  responsibility for the sums  that have been advanced  to the  Provincial Government, and this the  more so as Greece is financially in a strong position as compared with some of the Allies.    It having been  semi-officialby  intimated  by  M.  Jonuart that he  regarded  his mission to Greece as terminated, and enquiries having been addressed by the Foreign Office to the French  Government on the subject, Lord Bertie reported on  1st August that M. Ribot did  not  consider the High  Commissioner^ work at Athens as  ended and  desired  that he should  return thither,  to  represent  both the  British and the French Governments.    The Foreign Office have communicated to Mr. Crackanthorpe, for the information of the Greek Government,  certain measures  that have been decided  upon for  the provisioning of Greece.   In view of the shortage of wheat in  India and America,  a considerable  proportion of Greek requirements  will  have to  be met from Australia. The inter-Ally Chartering  Executive will arrange for the despatch  of  five  grain- carrying ships monthly either to India or Australia, according to circumstances.   The Greek Government,  on its side, will be required to  agree  to tranship or discharge cargoes coming from the  East at Port Said and have them conveyed thence  to Greek ports in small Greek vessels, so as to avoid the risks incurred  by ocean-going  ships in the voyage to piraeus.     The  inter-Ally Controls over posts and  telegraphs, police, roads,  and  railways were  officially abolished on 2nd  August.   The  question of the port and  passport controls remains to be  settled.  The  British Vice-Admiral  will discuss the matter shortly with  Mr. Crackanthorpe, with  a view to introducing, wherever possible, the modifications in procedure desired by the Greek authorities.     The  Minister  of Marine has  taken umbrage  at the action of M. Venizelos  in accepting the assistance  and advice of a British naval mission, without first consulting him in the matter.  Mr. Crackanthorpe is informed  that  he  intends to keep matters in his own hands by asking that the mission should not include an Admiral.     The Minister for Foreign  Affairs is  anxious  that  the  forthcoming London Conference should not come to any decision involving a  withdrawal of Allied troops from Salonika.  He fears that  the Allies may be  led to set too high a value  upon the
                          ALLIED  ENEMY  AFFAIRS.    The  &quot; Times&apos;s&quot; statement  regarding the Crown  Council held at  Potsdam on 5th July 1914, finds confirmation in  an  article by the Berlin correspondent of the&quot; Nieuwe Rotterdamsche Courant,&quot; published in that  paper on 7th September 19.1.4,and now reprinted.  The  correspondent in question  was a German named Herold,in close touch  with officialdom in  Berlin.  His  article  refers categorically to the potsdam Council of 5th July, and relates  its proceedings and results.  The -Kaiserand his civil advisers are described as being opposed to any measures that might leadto war, but  the  military group eventually succeeded in overcoming  opposition, on thegrounds that war was then a  much safer business for Germany than it  would be in1916 when France and  Russia were allowed to complete their military reorganisation,railways, &amp;c.  In view of  the unpreparedness of  Russia and France, the Kaiser andhis Chancellor  did not  believe that war  would result from giving  Austria the assurances of support for which  she asked.    The following, taken from the &quot; Times &quot; of  6th August, gives the Austrian officialcommentary on Lord Robert Cecibs speech in the House of Commons on 24th July : -    &quot; The &apos; Fremdenblatt,&apos;  which recognises that  Cecihs  speech, was free from any      aggressive animosity  and confined itself  to setting forth  the standpoint of      Great Britain in a sober, and. appropriate manner, most  emphatically and      solemnly  declares that, if Cecil makes a  distinction between Germany and      Austria-Hungary  in  describing  Austria-Hungary  as  not   his  enemy,  the      Monarchy will stand shoulder to shoulder with Germany just as  much in the      peace negotiations as  in  the  fight.   The  Monarchy and Germany, however,      have repeatedly allowed no doubt to exist that they are prepared for an honour-      able peace a peace which brings the peoples nearer one another, and puts an      end to their  violent hatred. If the possibility offered itself that English states-      men considered the  road  through Vienna practicable, we do  not think that we      ought to oppose a blunt No to such  a way of looking at things.  When  Cecil      declared  that France had expressed her desire  with regard, to Alsace-Lorraine      and that- England had to support  her, we can  reply to  him  that in  this       question  Germany will find us on her side unconditionally  and  Avithout any      reservation an  assurance which, after all, is  so  self-evident that there is       absolutely no need to give it.  Cecil knows well  enough that the return of       Alsace-Lorraine could only be forced from a completely defeated Germany, and       that our Monarchy will fight to the last breath on the side of her Allies.   AVe       are perfectly ready to  do what in  us lies to the furthest extent  in order to       bestow upon the world  the blessings  of peace.  But we will also fight to the       utmost in order that the oxitconie  of  this war for the Monarchy and her Allies       may be an honourable one.    &quot; As for the fate of Serbia, we  have, by setting forth  our general  fundamental       principle of  peace, sufficiently  made clear our standpoint as to the position of       Serbia  after peace.  This, however, can  never be sufficiently  emphatically       and energetically emphasized whatever the destiny of Serbia may prove to be,..       Serbia  must not be a focus of agitation against the Monarchy, nor a standing       clanger to the peace  of  Europe.   Austria-Hungary must exert herself to the-assistance likely to be rendered by the Greek Army in the near future ; apart from this, he-regards the presence  of a strong Allied  force in Macedonia as the best safeguard against Roj-alist and pro-German reaction.    By Royal Decree of 2nd August martial law was  proclaimed throughout Atticaand Boeotia.    The Serbian Prime Minister has forwarded (6th August) to the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs a Memorandum  in which are set forth Serbia&apos;s  objections to  anyweakening of  the Salonika front.   After pointing out that a victory on  that frontshould  be more  easily attained than on any other, and  might well  alter the wholecourse of  the war in our favour, M. Pashitch observes that  if the  Salonika front  is.weakened public  opinion in Greece will in all  probability turn  against M. &quot;Venizelosand the Allies.   The Serbian Army, now reduced to 70,000 men, would  in that case be completely and finally demoralised, and  the Serbian people, who have lost all buthonour, would cease to put their trust and hope in the  Allies.  A similar revulsion of feeling would occur in Rumania.
      utmost in. order  to  make the  return  of  such conditions impossible.   The      so-called  Southern Slav question solely concerns us, and we will never admit      its  international character, for we are absolutely  determined  to be and to      remain masters in our own house.  We demand for Austria-Hungary her own      right of self-government.&quot;   A report  from military sources states  that the  Rumanian harvest has  suppliedGermany and Austria with a million tons  of wheat  and a million of maize, leavingnothing for the inhabitants.  The same report places the present supplies of oil fromthe Rumanian wells at 25 per cent of their former  output.  A German official wirelessof 6th August says that the  transportation  is now  finished  of  &quot; crops  which were&quot; found in stock when the Central Powers entered Roumania, 90,000 tons of which&quot; had already been paid for by the British.&quot;   The transportation of the new crop hasalready commenced.                              GERMAN  AFFAIRS.   An article in the July number of &quot; DeutschlancPs  Erneuerung,&quot; criticising theforeign policy of the ex-Chancellor, asserts that he was completely under the influence of la haute finance, and especially of the Deutsche Bank, and put its interests beforethose of the nation.   His peace by agreement  policy was instigated, by the financiers,who  have nothing  to gain  by the  complete defeat of either side.   The &quot; WeserZeitung &quot;. describes this  article  as  typical  of the  shameless  methods of  the pan-Germans.    On &apos;6th August  the reconstruction of the Imperial  and Prussian Ministries  wasofficially  announced.   The  resignation  of  the  Imperial   Secretaries  of  State,Dr. Zimmermann (Foreign  Affairs),  Dr.  Lisco (Justice),  Herr  von Batocki  (food control),  and Dr. Kratke  (Imperial Post Office), and Under  Secretary Dr. Richter, andof the Prussian Ministers Dr. Beseler (Justice), Dr. von Trott zu  Solz (Education),Baron von  Schorlemer (Agriculture), Dr.  Lentze (Finance), and Herr von Loebell(Interior), has been accepted.  Dr.  Helfferich, who tendered  his resignation,  is toretain his position as a general deputy of the  Imperial Chancellor and as a member ofthe Prussian State Ministry.   He also remains in charge of. the Imperial Ministry ofthe Interior pending its reorganisation into two ministries,  viz., a reduced Ministry ofthe  Interior  confined to  internal  administration,  military, cultural  and  scientificaffairs, and a Ministry of Economics in charge of  commercial, economic  and socialquestions.  The following is the  composition of the new German Imperial Admiuis-tration and of the new Prussian Ministry.Empire.-  Imperial Chancellor.

Herr Helfferich           -           -  Minister of State.   *Herr von Tviihlemann         -       -  Foreign Affairs.

Flerr von Breitenhach     -           -  Public Works.   *Herr von Eisenhart-Rotbe     -       -  Agriculture.   *Herr von Waldow        -           -  National Provisioning.   Her von Kublemamfs appointment has been violently attacked in the Pan-german press on the ground that he  is a friend of an  understanding with  England, andopposed the submarine  war while he was Minister in Holland.   Parliament  has been reorganised  by the inclusion in the Prussian Ministry of herr  Spahn,  the  leader of  the  Centre  Party  in  the Reichstag,  and of Herr vonEisenhart-Rothe, an agricultural deputy, and  in  the Imperial Administration of Herrvon  Krause, a National Liberal and  Vice-President of  the  Prussian House ofRepresentatives.   Dr.  Wallraf, Burgomaster  of  Cologne, and  Herr Schwander, Burgomaster ofStrassburg, are leading representatives of German municipal life.   Herr Schwanderis an Alsatian, and  was actually born  a French  subject.   He was for 15 years achancery clerk in  the Colmar burgomasters office, subsequently studied, and becamean expert on  the administration of &quot;the  poor.   Dr. Midler,  of  the Hamburg Social Democratic Co-operative Society, was at onetime  a  gardener,  and . subsequently edited  a Socialist paper,  the &quot; MagdebufgerVolksstimme,&quot;  in  which capacity he  was actually sent to  prison  in  1899 for lesemajeste.   The rest of the Ministers are  taken from the bureaucracy.   But the enlargement of the  scope and character of both  the Imperial and Prussian Ministries is, fromthe German  point of view, very considerable, and justifies the  conclusion  of the&quot; Cologne Gazette &quot; that Dr. Michaelis in making up his Prussian Ministry has, whileselecting men  with  official training,  made agreement with  the Easter Message andthe decree  of 11th July regarding the  reform of electoral rights a  deciding factor inthe case of the  new appointments.   A Social Democrat in the Imperial administration is also, for  Germany,  a prodigy.   In a private letter to Lord  Hardinge  dared  24th. July; Sir E.  Howard reportedconversations on the part of a  leading Hamburg magnate  to persons in Stockholmforecasting a Coalition Ministry, including Radical and even Socialist  elements, andinsisting that the  views of  Dr. Michaelis were practically identical with those of Herrvon Bethmann-Hollweg, but that it had been thought wiser to get rid of the latter ashis presence  at the head of affairs was an obstacle to negotiations.  The  chief  pre-occupation of the German business world was the  fear of an economic war againstGermany after the peace. &apos; This was specially the  case since America  had come in,and  increased  the dissatisfaction felt  owing to the  comparative  unsuccess  of thesubmarine  campaign.   Sir  M.  Findlay  reports  that Mr.  Rudolf  Olsen,  a  well-known  shipowner ofChristiania, has been requested by a Hamburg firm to make a contract to carry largequantities  of coffee and cocoa from South America  to German)&apos;, shipment to  be made between four and eight weeks after the conclusion of peace between  England andGermany.  Mr. Olsen  enquires wdiat is  the  attitude  and policy  of His  Majesty&apos;sGovernment  in regard to shipments  after the war, it being his intention to refuse thebusiness if there is any objection to it.  tie states, in this connection, that the GermanGovernment  have  decided  to requisition all German tonnage for  one year after theconclusion  of peace,  and that  during  this period  all  private imports  and financialoperations  will be  controlled by the State.  The Hamburg  firm  hoped  to escape this control by  securing neutral tonnage.   Dr. David would  appear to have  superseded Scheiclemann  as  the  leader  of theSocial Democratic Party.  Speaking recently at Maintz he strongly deprecated the agitation of the Pan-Germans, and expressed the opinion that the best guarantee fora lasting peace, such as the nations desire, would be a free  Germany.                   * Those marked with an asterisk are new appointments.
                                   HOLLAND.   Sir Walter Townley has been directed  to obtain from  the Dutch Government an explanation of the continuance of the transit traffic in metals, which is contrary to the written assurances given by the Dutch Minister for Foreign Affairs, and would appearto constitute a gross breach of faith.  His  Majesty&apos;s  Government insist upon thecomplete stoppage of this traffic, and. are  in  communication with the United StatesGovernment with a view  to securing the export of metals &quot;from that country.   The finding of  the  Commission  of  Enquiry on  the  internment of  german submarines U-B 6 and U-B 30 was published in the Dutch Press on 3rd August.-TheU-B  b&apos; remains interned,  but the U-B 30 is released on the ground that, owing to fog,her commander was unable to recognise a certain Dutch coast light.                                SWITZERLAND.  . On the  28th of  July, an official communique was published in the Swiss  Pressintimating  that one of the results of the negotiations now proceeding between Germanand Swiss delegates for a new economic agreement would be that Switzerland wouldlend  Germany a considerable  amount  of  money (said to be  90,000,000 francs  amonth for  the nine months during  which  the  agreement will run) in  return  for facilities to purchase  German  coal.  The  price  of  the  latter will  be considerably increased.  Sir H. Rumbold proposes  to warn the Swiss Government that they should keep their  loan to Germany as low as possible in view  of the probability that theAllies will  demand similar financial  facilities,  failing which the Swiss  bankers whohave  lent  money&apos; to  Germany may  find  their cable, mail, and  banking  facilitiessuspended  in Allied countries.   He points out that  immediate action is required  toput a stop to the depreciation of the pound sterling  in Switzerland.  Three months ago it was  24* 50; on  7th August it was 21&apos;28 with a  downward tendency.  he suggests a large Anglo-French loan  to  prevent  the heavy losses  now incurred  inpaying for munitions,  &amp;c. ;  the establishment  of an Allied  clearing-house, and theprevention  of indirect  arbitrage  by stopping the sale  of sterling from one neutral country to  another.  The fall  in exchange is  directly  due to heavy selling ordersreceived  by Swiss Banks from  Stockholm, Amsterdam, and Copenhagen, probably on german  account.                                    SWEDEN.   There appears to be a general impression that Mr. Branting will obtain a majorityat the September elections.  Mr. Fluysmans considers that he will certainly be PrimeMinister.  A Stockholm banker, in close touch with Mr. Branting, has informed HisMajesty&apos;s representative  that,  if successful,  the socialist leader will  accept theresponsibility  of forming  a Government, but that it would be necessary  for him  tobe assured  of support from the Allied Governments (presumably in the matter  of sweden&apos;s imports).   Mr. Clive (in the absence of Sir E. Howard) suggests that, in order to  induce theSwedish  Government  to   resume  the parcel  post  service across Sweden, he  beauthorised to inform them  that unless  this is done, no further calling facilities will  begiven to the S.S, &quot; Stockholm,&quot; the pioneer and popular  ship of  the new  Swedish-American passenger line.   The &quot; Stockholm &quot; arrived at Gothenburg on 3rd August,and has been advertised to sail with passengers and cargo on the  18th.  To stop herrunning  to  America would be a severe blow to the many  small  shareholders in this line.                                   NORWAY.   The agreement reached between the Norwegian and German  Governments at theSassnitz Conference in the case of the S.S. &quot; Thorunn &quot; is severely criticised by the&quot; Sjofarts Tidende &quot;  (&quot;Shipping  News&quot;) as showing unjustifiable weakness on thepart of the Norwegian  Government.   His  Majesty&apos;s representative  at  Christiania
1.2considers  that  since  the  bomb scandal  something more than a  detente has takenplace between the German and Norwegian Governments.                                  DENMARK.   After  careful  consideration of the  facts and figures set forth in  the  Danish.Governments memorandum (vide last Report) on the importation of fodder stuffs andthe trade in agricultural produce, His Majesty&apos;s Government have decided that under existing conditions they are not in a position-to give the desired assurance regardingfacilities for fodder shipments.  Any such assurance would be nullified, by the UnitedStates prohibition of  imports and might  be construed as had faith.  His  Majesty&apos;sGovernment take note of  the fact that by the latest proposals the Danish Governmentwill do their  utmost to limit  the  export of bacon, butter and eggs to Germany to50 per cent.  At the same time acceptance of this proposal is not  to be  regarded asacquiescence in  the  quantities exported  to Germany, either  of these articles or of horses and  cattle, and the  Danish Government  is warned that the Allies, includingthe United States, are likely to take a serious view of  exports to Germany on a large.scale.  On the other hand,  His Ma;jesty&apos;s Government are making arrangements wherebyit is hoped to be able to  secure that British prices for Danish produce shall  be inreasonable proportion to the prices offered by neighbouring neutral countries.  HisMajesty&apos;s Government are also  prepared to consider favourably the offer of the danish government to sell the 75,000 tons of oil cake and 30,000 tons of maize which theyhave bought in the United States and Argentine respectively.   An  intimation in  theabove sense was conveyed  on 6th August  by His Majesty&apos;s representative at Copen-hagen to the Danish Minister for Foreign Affairs, who, in reply, expressed  the hopethat Great Britain would arrange to take half the meat which, - in the absence offodder, would have to  be exported.  His view was that, as  matters now stand,  theonly policy Compatible with strict neutrality is for Denmark  to divide the  export ofall produce, including meat, equally between Great Britain and Germany.    On the subject of the proposed fish  agreement, His  Majesty&apos;s  representative atCopenhagen has informed the Minister for Eoreign Affairs that  provided  the export offish from Denmark to Germany is limited  to 2,100 tons a month, no obstacle will beplaced by His Majesty&apos;s Government on the  importation into Denmark of  mineral oilson the same scale as before the embargo was imposed.                                     SPAIN.   His  Majesty&apos;s  Consul  at  Barcelona  is  informed  that  the next  meeting  ofParliamentarists  will take  place probably at Valladolid  on&apos;12th August.   At thismeeting will be submitted  the  draft of proposed modifications  in the constitution which, if passed, will be  presented for the King&apos;s  acceptance without transmissionthrough Government.   If  refused by His  Majesty, r,he Parliamentarists will adoptsuch  measures, peaceful  or violent, as they may think fit.  There  is still dissatis-faction and unrest in the Army, the rank and. file  complaining that nothing has beendone  to improve  their conditions  of service.  A  strike  on the.  Norte  Railway  isannounced, to begin on 10th August.   According to the &quot; Weser Zeitung &quot; of  3rd August, the Gorman Government haslodged a formal protest against the Spanish Governments recent order prohibiting allbelligerent  submarines from  entering Spain&apos;s territorial  waters.  The  same paperstates  that in  responsible  quarters  no official report had been  received  as to the alleged internment of U-boat 2-7 by the Spanish authorities at Corunna.   The metal workers&apos;  strike at Bilbao continues, but His  Majesty&apos;s Consul reports(8th August) that the Chamber of Commerce is  likely to  arbitrate and that the men.are anxious for a settlement.                                    CHINA.   Acting President Feng Kuo-chang arrived at Peking on  the  1st of August.  he came reluctantly and against the advice of the southern leaders, and is only willingto act as President for  a limited  period.  According to  the Japanese  Minister for
Foreign Affairs, his personal relations with  Tuan  Chi-jui are not very cordial, andshould he  be unable to work with  the  Premier,  he will return to -Nanking.  in japanese official circles, no great importance is attached to the attempt of Sun Yat-senand  other Southerners to establish a separate Government, as  they are short of funds and unable to agree among themselves.   The Chinese Foreign Office has informally intimated to the foreign representatives(4th August) that China will declare war  against Germany and Austria in the courseof the next few days.   Mr.  Alston reports (3rd  August) that a Japanese capitalist.named YatnamotoIotaro  has  nearly concluded negotiations for the  purchase of three  Austrian shipslying at Shanghai.  The purchase would  be in  the name  of  a Chinese  subject,approved by the Austrian Consul, and will  only be completed if  the Allied Powersinterested approve.  The vendors  stipulate that the  ships must  remain under theChinese flag, and not be sent to Europe during the war, but Mr. Yamamoto thinksthese conditions might he ignored once the ships have left China, and he proposes to let His Majesty&apos;s  Government purchase  one or two of  them at  actual  cost.   Thevessels have been offered to the  Russian Volunteer fleet, and other Japanese  biddersare negotiating to buy them.  The Japanese Foreign Office unofficially, say they will support whichever first  concludes negotiations, but they expect that the ships will eventually  be divided between Great Britain, Japan, and the United States.   In theevent of China  declaring war, these negotiations must  necessarily lapse.   In that event, the British Chamber of Commerce  suggests  the advisability of chartering theonly two suitable German vessels to run,  on account of  His  Majesty&apos;s Government,between Shanghai, and London and Shanghai and Marseilles, alternatively.                                     SIAM.   The Government of India having consented  thereto, the Siamese Government ispreparing to ship to India the German and Austrian subjects now interned  in  Siam.Their total number is about 280, including 48 women and 50 children.   Upon  the  advice  of  the Ministry  of  Shipping,  His Majesty&apos;s  representative atBangkok has been authorised to offer 645,O0OL for seven of  the  enemy vessels seizedby the Siamese Government, the other two  being taken over by the Siamese authorities.In this connection Sir E. Dering reports that the Japanese Minister, under  instructions,has approached the Siamese Government with a request that his Government shouldreceive an allotment of these enemy vessels under the same conditions as those applied in regard  to  the  applications  made  by Great Britain and France.   The SiameseMinister for Foreign Affairs  has replied that,  to  relieve  his  Government of  thedifficulty of deciding between conflicting schemes  and claims, it is  advisable thatthese should  be  arranged  between the British,  French, and-Japanese Governments,and  a common  proposal submitted.   In  any case, he  adds, the  ships  will not be repaired and  fit  to sail  for some months.   Under these circumstances, and  pendingsome such agreement between the rival claimants, the Siamese Government is unableto entertain offers for these ships by any of the parties and powers concerned.   The French Government have intimated to the British Foreign  Office  their desireto participate with Great  Britain  on a  footing of equality  in the  matter of  the personnel and capital  of  the State Bank of Siam,&apos; which is to be eventually established..by the conversion of the  Commercial Bank to that status.  They  ask that, to this end,Flis Majesty&apos;s  representative at Bangkok be instructed to support his French colleaguein obtaining from the Siamese Government the  immediate appointment  of  a FrenchSub-Director  to  the Commercial Bank.   Sir E. Dering recently  reported   that theindependent appointment by the Siamese of a British accountant to this Bank, in lieu of the German dismissed, had aroused the irritated jealousy of his French colleague.                                 ARGENTINA.   On 5th August  the Minister  for Foreign Affairs sent a further  telegram to theArgentine Minister at Berlin, insisting on a  categorical reply to the  representationsaddressed to the  German Government  early in  July (vide Report No.  25).  As theArgentine&apos;s conditions  amount  to a claim  of  complete immunity from attack forneutral commerce, the Minister for Foreign Affairs considers it unlikely  that Germany&apos;reply will be satisfactory.   3657-2                            D
                                    BRAZIL.   Sir A. Peel reports (3rd August) that an official  Note from the French Minister atRio to the Brazilian Government, has heen communicated to the Press, in which it  isdeclared that, as a special favour conceded only to Brazil, the French  Governmenthave removed the restrictions on the importation of Brazilian  coffee.  His  Majesty&apos;minister considers  that  the  result of this measure is to place Great  Britain in adisadvantageous position as compared to France, and may affect the personal attitudeof the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who, before assuming office,  was devoted  to Britishinterests.                                  ECUADOR.    Owing to the lack of coal, the passenger train service in Ecuador is temporarilysuspended.   His  Majesty&apos;s Minister at Quito observes, in  this  connection,  thatEcuador requires coal, jute, and financial assistance, and  would join the Allies, he thinks,  if assured of reasonable facilities  for  obtaining  them.  In that case theGermans&apos; railway  construction contract  would  be  cancelled  and Allied contractorswould have to be ready to carry on the work which, for internal political reasons, theGovernment is not prepared to stop.                                    MEXICO.   The Mexican Minister for Foreign Affairs has forwarded to His Majesty the  Kinga letter from Sehor Carranza, announcing his assumption of the Presidency.  HisMajesty&apos;s Government are in communication with the United States Government withreference to the question of  de  jure recognition of Sehor Carranza,  which  is not expected to be forthcoming.                                   PANAMA.   Panama, being now an Ally, asks  that His Majesty&apos;s Government  should remove the restrictions  on the importation of Panama coffee  and cocoa  into  the UnitedKingdom.   Sir C. Mallet observes that as the yearly total of these imports is less than500 sacks, it would be a friendly act to accede to this request.                               UNITED  STATES.   The nature and extent of United States&apos; financial assistance to the war purposes ofthe Allies, and the procedure for its  determination  and application, have formed thesubject of exhaustive proposals and negotiations during the past week.  For practical reasons fully  stated  by  the  Chancellor of  the Exchequer  in  a  telegram to lord northcliffe on 2nd August,  His Majesty&apos;s Government are unable to accept  the termsof the  draft agreement with  the United  States  Treasury proposed by the  allied representatives at Washington  on 27th July.   They point out that serious delays must inevitably take  place  before  the  supply experts  of France, Italy  and  Russia  canexamine and  report on the financial demands to  be submitted to the United  StatesGovernment in  the form of   an  agreed report by the  Inter-Allied Council.  TheChancellor of  the Exchequer  prefers, therefore, to reserve the  right of  dealing withthe  United  States Treasury direct.   The  reasons  which dictate the policy of  HisMajesty&apos;s Government in this matter  are especially exemplified  in the case of Russia,wdiose demand for $700,000,000  for the  current  year is  clearly open  to criticisminasmuch as the actual congestion of traffic in that country makes any further placing of substantial  Rttssian orders problematical for the immediate future.   On  2nd August, after consultation with Lord  Northcliffe,  Sir  C.  Spring Ricetelegraphed for the information of  the Cabinet a  resume of  the  internal politicalsituation and  of the difficulties which the Secretary of the Treasury has to face inobtaining a  new loan from Congress, and justifying his expenditure of the  last loan.He has reason to expect  hostile criticism from members of the special Committeesbefore whom he has to appear  ; they are likely to enquire,  inter alia, whether great
capitalists and trusts are profiting unfairly by money lent  by the American people,and whether the Allies&apos; expenditure of American money in America has resulted in raising the cost of living in the United States ?  He has to face enquiry and criticismconcerning the large sum given to pay the  overdraft  at Morgans, and a still largersum  for  the  maintenance of  British exchange  for general  purposes  of  trade.Mr. McAdoo himself fully appreciates the vital  importance  of  supporting Britishexchange, which is actually Allied exchange, but he has to reckon with the possibility &apos;that Congress may be unable or unwilling to appreciate anything else than  a cut anddried statement of  expenditure, prices, goods delivered, and the actual war  purposes which they have served.    Dealing with the cpiestion of exchange, Sir C. Spring Rice was directed  to convey to Mr. McAdoo on 2nd August a reply from the Chancellor of the Exchequer in whichit was explained that Great Britain can only continue to support  exchange  by meansof dollars received  from the United States  and so long  as assistance  in this form is forthcoming.   In  order to provide a temporary solution to meet immediate (August)requirements,  the  Chancellor suggested that Mr. McAdoo might agree to  repay theamounts  advanced by  the British Treasury for Russian expenditure in the UnitedStates since April roughly, $ 100,000,000.  Discussing&quot;the matter with His Majesty&apos;ambassador on 4th August, the Assistant Secretary of the Treasury (in the  week-endabsence of Mr. McAdoo) stated&apos;that the grave importance of  the question was  fully realised ;. he suggested that if  the United States Government agreed to  repay theRussian  advances as  proposed,  it  might  be  necessary to  request  His   Majesty&apos;ambassador to endorse the  certificates  of their indebtedness.  Mr.  McAdoo sub-sequently intimated  that the chief difficulty in  the matter  of supporting exchangelay in the  possibility  of its entailing exports  of gold from the United  States, a contingency which the Chancellor of the Exchequer regards as &quot;improbable.  Finally,on 5th August, the United.  States  Treasury advised His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador thatthey &apos;were  prepared to assist  in meeting the  exchange  situation  by making anadditional advance of S 50,000,000 for the current month for general purposes.    At an informal Conference held, at the request of the United States Treasury on &apos;3rd August at which Lord  Northcliffe, M.  Tardieu, and  the  Russian and ItalianAmbassadors  were present, the  Assistant Secretary stated  that before any furthercredits could be granted to the  Allies, the inter-Allied  Council must  be definitely established, and he insisted that it should  be convened before the 15th.   Its establish-ment  must  not be  taken to imply, however, either that  the  Allies would receive thesame  treatment as the United States Government in respect of prices or that  the United States  Treasury was thereby committed to any financial engagement.  In replyM. Tardieu stated  that the matter was receiving immediate attention  from  the Britishand French Governments ;  they had suggested  that  the  Council,  should meet in paris and that  the United States Government should be invited to nominate a representative.. The Assistant Secretary to the Treasury stated that the President was not prepared to sanction  the nomination of an American representative on the Council.    The  question   of measures for  repaying or greatly  reducing the $400,000,000overdraft at Morgans  has  also formed the subject  of  lengthy negotiations.   TheSecretary of the Treasury saw no prospect (30th July) of affording direct  assistancein  the liquidation of this overdraft and-&apos; suggested the  floating  of a  British loan onthe New  York market for the purpose ; he also  thought that it  might  be graduallyreduced by means of savings effected on  the monthly advances ($ 185,000,000) from:&quot;the United  States  Treasury.   Mr. J. P.  Morgan (whose friendly attitude in these negotiations has been gratefully acknowledged by the Chancellor of the Exchequer)expressed the  opinion that the best way to approach the  question was  to endeavour toreconstruct  the position  as  it  would have been in April  had the  United  states treasury then intimated that it  could not assist in  liquidating the overdraft.  Hesuggested several alternative expedients  for reducing the overdraft to $150,000,000 by the  end  of  the year, which are now  under  consideration.    On 4th  AugustSir C. Spring,  Rice reported that Air. McAdoo was prepared to consider arrangementsfor the issue of $200,000,000 of  British  Treasury notes  of  not  less than  two  yearscurrency, their rate of interest to  be sufficient to  enable the notes to be placed on the market.    The State Department does  not anticipate anjr adoption of mail censorship by the United States  Government  at present, but considers that it will be necessary so soon as the Enemy Trading Act comes into force.    Sir O. Spring  Rice advises that, in order to defeat the efforts of pro-German Irish extremists and agitators who are working to wrreck the Irish Convention, His Majesty&apos;s       3G57-2                              E
Government should issue and have promulgated a statement exposing the falsity oftheir accusations, and contradicting the lies wherewith  they continue to delude Irish-American opinion.   Such a  statement  should show  clearly that for many years andin many ways the English  and Irish  have been  working together to  remedy  themistakes of the past.   A statement by the  Prime Minister on the subject would gainimmediate and widespread attention.   For the purposes of the Allied Blockade policy for bringing pressure to bear onneutrals, the Exports Council and the State Department at Washington are preparedto adopt in its entirety the policy proposed by Great Britain, but before advising  thePresident in this sense they fe&apos;el the need of more definite information,  and a clearerunderstanding with the British Government as to  the  possible results  of that policyand  the measures prepared  to meet  them.  If the resulting pressure of  combinedaction were such as to  bring neutrals  to the verge of  conflict with  Germany, whatplan have  the Allies for  protecting them against  attack ?  Also the  United StatesGovernment require to know before declaring a complete embargo on  all exports to neutrals, how far Great Britain is able and willing to co-operate by suspending the issueof all export licences ?  Sir C. Spring  Rice is of opinion  that if the  United StatesGoATernrnent are to take energetic action on comprehensive lines, it will be necessaryfor Great Britain to suspend  all rationing agreements made  with  the NetherlandsOversea Trust  and  other similar associations.   Mrs Hoover  concurs  and  statespositively that no effecth-e action can be expected from the United States until theyare assured, that Great Britain is prepared to  adopt  and enforce an  identical policy,and,  wherever necessary, to  terminate  such agreements  as  may conflict with it.Similar assurances  would also be required from France.                         THE SHIPPING SITUATION.    On -1th August Sir C. Spring Rice reported that the United States Shipping board had taken over all ships building in United States 3rarcls, for the purpose of expeditingconstruction.  The Secretary of State has  intimated that their subsequent disposalwill be a matter for future consideration.  It is  noteworthy that  information  to  thesame effect,  based on  Associated  Press news, was  published&apos; in a German  officialwireless on 5th August.    On 5th August the Shipping Commission supplied the following figures, pending a more detailed statement, to  His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador,  showing the  present and.prospective position of tonnage construction in the United States : -                                                             Gross tonnage.         Steamers under private construction        -         -  1,250,000         Wooden ships under private construction -            -    250,000         Shipping Board, steel and wooden          -          -    500,000         United States ships,  otherwise employed,   but   now           available                    -                     -  1,200,000         German ships -         -         -         -         -    500,000    The question of protective shipping is receiving very close attention, and measures are  being devised,  in consultation with  the  British  Admiralty,  for  the  rapidconstruction of a large  number of small and fast vessels of the sloop type.    The  United States  Shipping Board  have been refusing to license the export ofsteel plates  for Japan, acting upon the policy (in which His Majesty&apos;s Governmentoriginally concurred) that such export should be made conditional on a suitable arrange-ment as to the employment of Japanese shipping.  In view of the recent modificationof the British Governments attitude in this matter, however,  the  State Departmentnow desire to be definitely informed as to the policy which it  is intended to pursueand whether His Majesty&apos;s Government desire that the United States should drive thehardest possible bargain with Japan, or not?    Danish shipowners refuse to allow7 their vessels, employed under the terms of the-agreement recently concluded,  to be used for the Mediterranean  trade.   They would never have ratified the  agreement had not their delegates stated positively that theyhad  received  informal assurances  from  His Majesty&apos;s  Government  that  vessels.(other than armed requisitioned ships) would not be sent to  the  Mediterranean.    A  proposed arrangement for  the future disposition and  handling  of Swedish:shipping was  lately communicated by the Foreign  Office  in London, to Mr. Welin
(representing  the  Swedish Shipowners&apos;  Committee) in the form of a memorandum,which provided on the one hand for the  continuance of  Swedish  shipping traffic in Allied interests, and  on the other for  coal and navigating facilities to be providedfor Sweden by Great Britain.  The Swedish Minister for  Foreign Affairs has pointedout to His Majesty&apos;s Minister, however, that unless Sweden can be sure of obtainingcargoes from America, there  is no inducement for the Swedish Government to enterinto  arrangements for the employment of Swedish shipping in the  interests  of theAllies.   In  reply, Sir  E. Howard has  been instructed  to state  that the basis ofHis  Majesty&apos;s Governments  proposal is to  leave Sweden ships  sufficient for  heressential needs,  to license her coal requirements and in return to obtain the servicesof the rest cf her merchant  fleet.   But  His Majesty&apos;s Government cannot do morethan  guarantee  shipping facilities for cargoes  from  the  United States, the  export licences of which are a matter for the United States Government.   According to&apos;a Berlin telegram in the &quot; Kolnische Volkszeitung &quot;  of the 6th, it isofficially stated that  the losses of U boats from 1st February  to 1st  August averageonly a little  over  three a month, while the  rate of  their production is many timeshigher.                            PEACE DISCUSSIONS.   Sir R. Rodd has had a talk with a M. Guerin who, in connexion with  French and belgian relief, has paid several visits to Germany, and who has come to the conclusionthat the one point on which the Germans are most concerned is that there should beno impediment in the terms of  peace to their obtaining unlimited  supplies of rawmaterial as soon as possible.  Their  industrial centres  have enjoyed immunity frominvasion, factories have been kept going at low pressure, and ahl  that is wanted  tomake use of a magnificent  opportunity of displacing  French  and Belgian, and to alarge  extent  also  British,  industry, is the  return of  the men from the front andabundant raw material to work up.   A combined meeting of the Executive Committees of the Soldiers&apos;  and Workmens&apos;Council and  the  Peasants&apos;  delegates wras  held  at Petrograd  on  2nd  August,  toreceive the report of M. Rosanoffs  negotiations abroad for the organisation of theInternational Socialist Conference.  After hearing this report the meeting adopted a resolution declaring that the  only means  of  speedily  bringing  the  war  to anend is to strengthen  and organise the movement  for a peace  without  annexationsor indemnities.  To this  end energetic steps are required, viz. :    (1) To summon the Stockholm Conference at an early date.   (2) To remove all  obstacles which belligerent Governments  may raise  to prevent          Socialists going to Stockholm.   (3) To issue a further proclammation to the world at large  explaining that the          continuance of the war will place  all  Europe, and  especially  the  Russian          revolution, in a tragic position, by wrecking all hope of a j ust and universal          peace.   The nations at war must compel their Governments to  accept the          Russian Provisional Governments peace formula.   The &quot;Social  Demokraten&quot;  (Stockholm)  announced on 6th  August that theInternational  Conference had been definitely fixed for  9th September  &quot; after  con-sultation  with  the English parties concerned.&quot;  In the meanwhile it  appears im-probable that, apart from Russia, any of the Allied Governments will  acquiesce in thepretension of the leaders  of the  International to  direct the policies of  Europe and america.  France and the United States are believed to be opposed to  the Conference ;Italy will,  not be represented.   Even  in the Russian  Government the  non-socialistmembers  would  prefer that the Conference  should not take  place, fearing that itmight have a had  effect upon the army; but since it must be held, they hope thatsocialists from other countries may be there, so that Russia  be not the only countryrepresented.   M. Keren sky  thinks that a refusal to allow British socialists to attendwould expose Great Britain to attack in Russian socialist circles, and Sir G. Buchananholds the personal opinion that  it would he a mistake to leave the field clear for theGermans.   Arrangements  are  being made for delegates  from  Copenhagen, Christiania andGothenburg  to  attend the  Conference, organised by  the  Seamens&apos;  and Firemens&apos;Union, to be held in London on 17th August.
   The &quot; Bremen Free Committee for a German Workmens&apos; Peace&quot; has  issued  amanifesto stating the terms  of  the peace  they desire, which shall to some extentcompensate  them for the sacrifices they have made  during the war.   These includesecurity of frontiers, lands for settlement, the freedom of the seas, and indemnities.In one of  several explanatory notes  they explain that &apos;&quot;&apos; all those injured in or by the&quot; war must  have pensions ;  and without indemnities, the  taxes would  be  unbearable&quot; for workers.&quot;   Speaking at  a war anniversary meeting  at Melbourne Town Hall on 4th August,Mr. Hughes  said, &quot; We must set our faces  against the  Stockholm Conference, and&quot; against  those who speak about peace under any guise for the sake of sectional&quot; interests.   There can be no peace until a decisive victory is gained and  until the&quot; enemy of peace has no longer power to disturb the.world.&quot;                                      GENERAL.   Under the title&apos;: Problems of Eastern and Central Europe,&quot;  a remarkably  lucidand   trenchant  survey  of  the  European  problem  has  been published  for privatecirculation  by  the  well-known  Polish leader, M.  Roman Dmowski.  Stated  in  a sentence,  M. Dmowskbs contention is that the enemy is not Germany  qua Germany,but  German domination .over Europe,  as  expressed in  the  continued &apos; existence ofAustria-Hungary as an instrument of German policy, and in the  throttling of Polandinvolved  in  German  control  of  the Baltic coast.  His  solution is  drastic but wellargued.   Austria-Hungary must be broken up,  the purely German portions going to austria,   Hungary being reduced  to  strictly  ethnographic  limits  and  effectivelyweakened so&apos; as to give free play to the consolidation and growth  of  Czecho-Slovakia,Greater Rumania, and  Jugoslavia.  A restored  Poland  should  comprise  not  only those regions of the ancient  kingdom  of Poland where the  Poles are in an actualmajority,  but those regions to the  east  of  it  where  Polish civilisation  and  the roman Catholic religion  are  still dominant, including Lithuania, and last but not least, the Baltic coast from about 70 miles west of Danzig to the Baltic Provinces.   Thiswould make Poland a country of about the same area and population as France.   Twoor three millions of these will  be Germans in West and East Prussia.  M. Dmowskirelies on  Polish  immigration  to  swamp them, and, in any case,  his argument  isthat  either these  Germans must come under Poland, or 20  of  30  million  Poles  mustbecome vassals of Germany.   M. Dmowski  realises that  .only a crushing  victory can  attain these  ends.   Hiswhole point is that if they are not attained, if anything even resembling a peace onthe basis  of &quot;no annexations&quot;  comes about,  Germany will have secured effective control of all Central and Eastern Europe, including, the  Palkans, Rumania, Poland,and through Poland of the unorganised amorphous hinterland which is  all that inhis opinion  Russia is likely to be for a generation or more.   Some of M. Dmowski&apos;conclusions  may  be overstated, but a perusal of his  chapters should be an invaluableantidote   to   the  confused  thinking on these problems that is  so  common in  thiscountry.   The German Government accepted  the  Prisoners of War agreement, as negotiatedat The Hague, and notified the Dutch Minister in Berlin accordingly, on the 25th  July.The  proposal that Hull should  be  the port for  conveying  prisoners  to and  from holland, was made, during the negotiations,  on  11th  July, without objection  being raised.  Discussing the preparations being  made to commence  working under theagreement,  Sir  W. Townley now reports (7th  August) that  the  German Admiraltystrongly objects to Hull, and matters are therefore at a standstill.   Reports received from American Consular officials lately in Turkey state that  some10,000 prisoners  of war (British,  Russian, and Rumanian)  are concentrated  atRas-el-ain and are fed by a Relief Committee from Aleppo.  The Relief Committee  atConstantinople is short of funds and working badly.   ReuteFs telegram to the Dutch  Press, reporting Lord Newton&apos;s statement in theHouse of  Lords regarding  the agreement concluded at  The Hague, has  been repro-duced in  the German Press with the addition  of a declaration,  falsely attributed  toLord  Newton, that  &quot; no complaints had  been  made as to the treatment of british prisoners  in Germany.&quot;   The  actual statement  made  was  that  &quot; practically no&quot; courplaints had been received with reference to the treatment of German prisoners&quot; in Great Britain.&quot;
