SECRET.APPRECIATION   OF  THE  ATTACHED  WESTERN  AND  GENERAL        .   \...... .&quot; ,       ,.REPORT, No.  39.&quot;           I                          CANADA.   The declaration of policy by llie new  Union Government..outlines a bold  and far-rQaching programme of reconstruction.  Instead^ however, of committing the subjectof reconstruction to a separate Ministry, Sir R.  Borden  lias divided  his Governmentinto  two main Committees, one for carrying on  the war and  the other for development and  reconstruction.                                      ITALY.   The  Germans are,  apparently,  attempting to accentuate the  Italian  domesticcrisis by their attack on the Isoiizo front.                                 ENEMY AKI AII;,S.   Von  lvuhlmaiiu&apos;s  declaration at Budapest  that Germany  is  against a trade warafter the war  is no doubt sincere.   Germany is confident that site can organise her economic control  over Central  Europe quite, sufficiently by railway rates and canaldevelopments,  and is  therefore only too anxious to avert any organisation or eoiu-binatiou among the  Allies which may  prevent her recapturing her  trade positionin the outer world.  The  proposal  for diverting the  Danube to  Oonstanza  is typicalof the direction in which German thought is working most actively.                                     MKKIOO.   Idle  situation seems to be approaching a  critical phase.   If President  Carranzatakes an openly pro-German  line, the rebel. General, Pelaez, can, however, be trustedto espouse  the Allied, cause.  If Carranza can be squared, Pelaez  will regretfully become  a pro-Ge.rni.an.                                PLACE DISCUSSIONS.    ddie Peace Eormula issued by the Scandinavian, Dutch and  Spanish delegates to the  Stockholm Socialist Conference  bears many obvious marks of German  inspiration, e.g., the suggestion,  that  Flanders and  Wallonia  are  to remain separate, that  a referendum in Alsace-Lorraine should be by districts, that Prussia and Austria should retain their Polish territories,  &amp;o.  On the other hand, the proposals to create a Greater Bohemia embracing the Slovak regions of Hungary, and to restore the independence of Serbia, show a  certain  indifference to Magyar and Bulgar ideas  which the German Government  itself  cannot officially  avow.   The   Sovyet   instructions  to their delegate to the forthcoming  Allied Conference follow this formula sufficiently closely to warrant  the claim, of the Stockholm Committee that the Russian delegates were in agreement  with  them.  It remains to  be seen whether  the Belgian delegates will disclaim the similar statement made with reference to themselves.
   The 1&apos;opc&apos;s- suggestion that peace  can  be  secured by abolishing  compulsory military service is based on the assumption that  fundamental causes can be:got rid of by  suppressing  some particular manifestation  of their effects.   The  natural  con-sequence  of  suppressing compulsory service, as  long  as  the underlying  causes ofnational rivalry still existed, would be to accentuate the tendency of modern Avar to concentrate more and  more  on mechanical and  technical devices, which are,  in  anycase,  produced by  voluntary  paid  industrial effort, and  mostly worked by  skilledvolunteers.   The rich and highly industrialized States would benefit at the expense oftheir neighbours.   Germany would  have little to fear  from  Russia and  could  con-cetitrate   freely  on building  her  battleships,  submarines and  aeroplanes  againstEn gland.   It  would  be  interesting to know,  too, how  voluntary  service  is to be defined.Would it  be voluntary service if everyone who had failed to oiler himself for militaryservice wore  disfranchised, disqualified  for any other Slate service, debarred from thebenefits of national insurance or pension schemes, and subjected to  special, taxation ?Would it also conduce to the world&apos;s peace if  in  lieu of compulsory service, which isnational and carries an element of  responsibility with  it, the Governments of europe in future devoted themselves to hiring volunteer Chinese and negro  armies?25th October 19.17.L.

PART  I.-BRITISH  EMPIRE  AND   AFRICA.                                    CANADA.   An important declaration  of  policy of  the new  Union  Government has  beenissued.   As to the representation of various interests, it is stated :     &quot; The present National, or Union,  Government has been formed with  a desire  to       give representation to all elements of the population who support the purpose       and effort of Canada in this war.  Representative men of both political parties       are  included in its personnel, and  it is intended forthwith to give  Labour       special representation  on.  the principle already followed  with  regard  to       agriculture.&quot;   The non-party  character of the Administration  is  emphasised in the following words :    &quot; Impressed by  the urgent necessity of  putting aside all minor considerations, of       sinking all party differences, and of  presenting  a united  front at this solemn       and momentous juncture in the nation&apos;s  history, the members of the Union       Government have come together in the duty of service to the national interest.&quot;   In outlining  the  measures to be undertaken  by the Cabinet, the  vigorousprosecution of the  war in co-operation with the  rest  of  the  Empire, involving theimmediate enforcement of  the Military Service Act, is  placed  first.  Other  items  ofpolicy mentioned are adequate taxation  of war  profits and  increased  taxation  of incomes ; a strong and progressive immigration and colonisation  policy accompaniedby suitable provisions to induce settlement  on  tire  land; effective  arrangementsfor  demobilisation  and the  care and training of returned soldiers ;  developmentof transportation  facilities  (including the co-operative management of the variousrailwa,ys in order to ensure  economy   and  avoid unnecessary construction) ;  develop-rnent of the shipbuilding  industry  and  the  establishment of  steamship  lines  on both  the  oceans  and the  Great Lakes ;  investigation  of the possibilities of the airservice for national purposes ;  encouragement of co-operation amongst those engagedin. agricultural production ;  the extension of the franchise  to women, with provisionsenabling married women to determine their nationality ; reform  of the Civil Service,involving the abolition of patronage ;  and adequate consideration of  the needs of theindustrial, population.   It is further  stated that the Government will  aim at a  truerunderstanding  between the  various communities  both  East and  West  and  thedevelopment of a national, spirit and united effort  among the people.    Orders in Council are being prepared establishing a permanent Committee of theCabinet  for the effective prosecution 0f the Avar, and another  Committee  for thepurpose of carrying out other lines of  policy mentioned above.  The functions of theWar Committee will&apos;be to co-ordinate the efforts of  all Government Departments &quot;forthe prosecution of the war and to ensure that the  full power of Canada is thrown intothe national endeavour in dealing with such matters as the maintenance of the militaryforces, the enforcement of  the Military Service Act, the  defence of the coasts, thetraining and equipment of troops,  regulation of  exports, &amp;c.  The Members  of thisCommittee  will  be the  Prime  Minister  (Sir R. Borden). the President  of the privy Council.  (Mr.  Powell), the Ministers of Militia (General  Mewburn),  Finance(Sir  T. White),  Marine and. Naval Service  (Mr.  Ballantyne),  dustice (Mr.  Doherty),Public Works (Mr.  Carved),  Customs (Mr. Sifton), Overseas Military Forces (Sir  E.Kemp or his representative), and Postmaster-General. (Mr. Blondin).   The functions ofthe Second  Committee wdll be those of  Reconstruction and Development, and will include the investigation of  the resources of the Dominion, the formation of a  schemeof immigration and colonisation, demobilisation and settlement of  soldiers on the land,transportation, investigations regarding air service  and labour conditions, &amp;c.  TheCommittee will be  presided over by Mr. A. K. Maclean, assisted by Senator Robertson(see  announcement below)  and the  other Members  will be the  Prime Minister,  theMinisters of Trade  (Sir George Foster), railways (Dr. Reid), Colonisation (Mr. Calder),Interior  (Mr. Meighen), Agriculture  (Mr.  Crerar) and  the Chairman of the MilitaryHospitals Commission.   The first public meeting of the election campaign  in support of the  new  Union.GoA^ernment Avas held at Winnipeg on 22nd October, when declarations  were  madeas to the necessity  of the Coalition in order to ensure the energetic prosecution of  the
-war.  The Liberal Minister of Colonisation and Immigration in the new Government(Mr. J. A. Calder-) stated that from the first he was impressed by the sincerity ofSir R. Borden, and the early attempts at union failed because there were too manyintermediaries.  &quot; There is only one  thing  before us all,&quot; he said, &quot; and that is thewanning of the war.&quot;   He continued,  &quot;Apart from the war, the Union Govern-ment meant better administration, more energy, and less waste.&quot;  He gave it  ashis  belief  that  they  would  cut  the  very  heart  out of  the   patronage evil  inCanada, and place the Civil Service  on a higher plane and outside  politics.  TheConservative  Minister of the  Interior (Mr. A. Meighen) asserted  that the return to power of the forces behind  Sir Wilfrid Laurier would mean that Canada would desertthe Allies and shrink from the field of battle.   He added : &quot; The Government on whosebehalf we speak is built upon the rock of  compulsory service, and on that rock we standor fall.&quot;  The Minister of Agriculture (Mr. T. A. Crerar, Independent Liberal) statedthat the farmers favoured the Union Government from the first and during the warthey -were  content to lay aside all differences on the tariff issue in order to unite withthe rest of the Dominion in the vigorous prosecution of the war.    Two further additions have been  made to the Union Cabinet  by the appointmentof Mr.  A..K. Maclean (ex-Attorney General for Halifax and Liberal Member for thatCity in  the Dominion House of Commons), and Senator Robertson, of Welland, Ontario(who lias long been prominent in the ranks of  organised labour and is Vice-Presidentof the Order of Railroad Telegraphers) as Ministers without Portfolio.  The last-namedwill be the first direct representative of Labour occupying a seat in a Canadian Cabinet.    Up  to 13th October the Medical  Boards had secured  by  voluntary examinationone-fourth of  the 100,000 men required  for oversea service.   The figures to that datewere as follows :           Passed into Category A           -      -       -       -  24,980         Passed into other categories          ...  28,634                                        Total examined  -       -  53,614   Mr.  Rodolphe  Lemieux  (ex-Liberal Minister  of Marine and Fisheries  under SirW. Laurier), in a speech at Longueil, urged men to go before the Examining Boards soas not  to lose their votes, as they might be disfranchised if they did not do so.   he stated  he had  brought a message from Sir  Wilfrid Laurier asking them to obey theMilitary Service Act,   Regulations  defining the duties of  employers are shortly  to  be issued  under theMilitary Service Act.   Employers will  be required to ascertain whether any of their employees are included in the first list called up, and they will also be compelled to notify the authorities of any emplo3ree who fails either to report or to claim exemption.Failure to comply  with the  regulations will  render the employer  liable to  a line notexceeding $100, and. not less than $50 for each, employee, or 8 months&apos; imprisonment,or both. An employer who knowingly retains in his  service a deserter or absenteewill, be  liable to six months&apos; imprisonment or a fine of from $100 to $500.   Shortly before  the rising of the  Dominion Parliament, the Prime Minister called attention to the  extensive collection of trophies of  the war which had been  presented.to the Government of Canada by the  President  of the  French Republic and by thePrime   Minister of  the  United  Kingdom.   Sir  R, Borden expressed the  waimappreciation of the people of Canada for the generosity  of  the French  Republic in sending the articles and in assuming the heavy charges incidental  to conveying themto Canada.  The  larger  trophies from the British naval and  military authorities hadnot, at the time  the Prime Minister spoke, arrived in  Canada.   Mr. Charles  Stewai-t has become Premier of  Alberta  in  succession to  Mr. A. L.Sifton  on the latter taking office as Minister of Customs in the Dominion Government.   The Dominion Government have been informed  that a large  number  of  vessels had been bought by the British Government in the United States  before the entry ofthat country into the war and it  had been  hoped that delivery wrould be made.   As,however, the United States authorities have decided to requisition the ships for urgentmilitary requirements, it has become necessary to replace the  serious loss entailed  byother tounage.   The  hope  is therefore expressed that  the Dominion  Ministers will agree to withhold  their consent  to the delivery of vessels which are being built inCanada for  the  United  States.  It is added that  the French Government desirepermission to be given for one of the vessels building  at  the Thor Iron Works to betransferred, to the  French flag, and the  Shipping  Controller earnestly hopes  that  suchpermission will  not be given.
                      AUSTRALIAN COMjVJ ON WE A LTH.   The Prime Minister (Mr. Hughes) is suffering from nervous  prostration, clue tooverwork, and he has been ordered away for a short rest.   Meantime the Minister forthe Navy (Mr. Joseph  Cook) will act as Prime  Minister,  and one of the HonoraryMinisters (Senator Russell) will take charge of shipping matters.   In reply to the suggestions of the Army Council regarding the establishment inAustralia of a School of Military Aeronautics, &amp;c. (oide Report No.37), the Prime Ministerof the Commonwealth admits that the standard of training in the Australian  CentralFlying School is not high, but he points out that this  is due  to the impossibility ofobtaining fast machines  of the  latest  type  from the War Office.  There  are  onlyavailable a few  slow machines  (some  of which have been  built in  Australia) suitablefor elementary training.   Mr. Hughes  states  that the  advice  received from Englandas to faster types  has been extremely contradictory, and  when machines have  been ordered the  supply has  been refused.  The  reason given  for this  Iras been thedifficulty of transport, but it is pointed out that this is not  correct as some Australiantransports have returned in ballast.  Arrangements are being made for an officer nowcommanding an Australian Squadron, in Europe to  return to the  Commonwealth inorder to replace the present Chief  Instructor at the  Central Flying School.   It isproposed, to continue the elementary training of pilots as reinforcements for Australiansquadrons in France and Egypt.   The higher  training, it is added, will be absolutelycontingent upon the British authorities allowing a small, supply of faster machines.   In  view of  the representations of  the Army  Council  upon, the  suggestions for granting leave to members of the Australian Imperial Forces (vide Report No. 37), theCommonwealth  Government have telegraphed that they do not now press their request.They, however,  strongly urge that the 1914 medal,  which they understand is about tobe given  to men  who left England in the  original Expeditionary Force, should beextended  to  Australians who formed, the original,  contingents.  In this event  thosewho took part in the Anzac landing of 25th April would, be included, and it  is  addedthat the recognition would be greatly appreciated in Australia.    The Commonwealth Government are establishing a National War Museum.  Thiswill be located temporarily in the Melbourne Exhibition Building.    Instructions for the further protection of shipping in Australian ports have beenissued  by  the Commonwealth  Government.   All doubtful aliens  are to  be excludedfrom wharves and ships.   Aliens are to  be considered as doubtful unless vouched forby some  responsible person ;  but it is to be noted that the  last  condition does notapply to alien enemies and naturalised subjects of  enemy origin,  who are prohibited from wharves and ships under the Aliens Restriction Order.    The moratorium  regulations  for  soldiers  have  been  extended,  and  variousrestrictions  have  been placed on landlords.   For example, house rents are not  to  beincreased  except where  improvements have been made, and  then only an increase of8 per cent, on the amount expended is permissible.    The shipping  trouble appears to have  ended.   The Melbourne Branch, of theFederal SeameiPs Union declined for some time to resume work  with volunteer non- unionists,  but the steamship owners decided to employ all seamen  willing to  work wdth volunteers, irrespective of  whether the  Melbourne seamen resumed or not, and this action improved the prospects of  settlement   The Victorian  seamen decided to return to work  on. 22nd October; and large numbers  of the  Sydney seamen are now returning.   The President of the Sydney Wharf Labourers&apos; Union, speaking after the ballot had shown that the men voted for resumption, said &quot; We admit  we have  for once been beaten.&quot;    Mr. Hampson (ex-M.P.) who unsuccessfully contested Bendigo at the last election as the opponent of Mr. Hughes, and  who strongly criticised the war  policy  of the Government, has enlisted in a railway unit with the rank  of Corporal.                                 NEW ZEALAND.     The Minister of Defence and Minister of Public Health have notified to  the Army  Council  the willingness of the Dominion Government to  take  about 20 officers of  the Imperial Forces for  electrical and bath  treatment at Rotorua.  It is pointed out  that the officers would only have to find board and lodging at about 21  10s. per week,  and the more serious cases could  travel free  on hospital  ships, while others could  utilise returning transports.  The.sea voyage,  it is added, has proved  an invaluable  restorative to New Zealand wounded, and the treatment at liotorua has been especially  beneficial in cases of shell-shock, neurasthenia, and stiff limbs.      4073-4-                             n
G   The Chinese Consul-at &quot;Samoa having complain.ed that  unrest  is being caused  bythe : Administrator  compelling Samoan women to leave Chinese subjects with whom they have been living for years, and  by;whom they have  children, the dominion government have been asked to report upon the matter.                             LEEWARD  ISLANDS.  &apos;. AVith  regard  to the  prohibition  of the  exportation  of  sea  island  cotton (vide report No. 38), the Cotton - Growers&apos; Association of  the  Leeward  Islands have repre-sented that large quantities of  clean  cotton have been purchased locally at 4-2 penceper lb., and they urge strongly that this price per lb. should be paid locally afterinspection by the Imperial Department of Agriculture for the West Indies officers.PART  II.-FOREIGN AFFAIRS.                               ALU ED  -AFFAIRS.   ddie French Government  are  anxious that  the  Allied  War  Conference should meet  in Paris about  15th November. -  The Russian Government  have suggestedLondon as  the meeting place,  and the latest advices date the probable arrival  ofColonel House on 20th November.   In view of this  the British Government  are  nowadvocating a postponement of  the  informal discussions between the Allied statesmenuntil  then.   The British  offer to  provide a ship to  bring Colonel House  has been.gratefully received by  the  United States Government, which, has, however, decided.to send him under his own flag.   Mr.  Erskine  reports  that Baron  Sonnino  favours  the British  suggestion  forinformal discussions of Allied  interests  among the various  representatives sent  toattend the Allied Conference,  and  is  opposed to  set,  meetings with definite Agenda,the more  so now that it has become known  that  a  member  of the Sovyet  is  to  beaccredited as a Russian representative.   Great Britain and France have intimated to the Russian Government that while their  representatives  in the Allied Conference will  be pleased  to hear the views  ofthe delegate of the Sovyet, who is to accompany the Russian Minister for  ForeignAffairs, in  private conversation,  they cannot  permit  him  to take  part  in any  of theofficial proceedings as he is neither a member of  an Allied Government nor responsible to any Head of a State, as  will be the  case  with the United  States representative.In reply to  this the  Russian  Minister  for  Foreign  Affairs  explained  to Sir  G.Buchanan that he did not think  the Germans would take Petrograd. for another  two orthree months, consequently  their advance would not  interfere&apos;with his departure for london on. or about 3rd November as already arranged.  He lias intimated that  unlessthe Peace Programme put forward  by the Sovyet (vide Peace  Discussions) lie with-drawn he will not take  IVI. Skobeleff, the delegate of  the Sovyet, to London with him.In any case he proposed to explain to the Pre-Parliament  the  exact position to  be occupied  at the  Allied  Conference   by  any  unofficial  representative who  mightaccompany the Russian Mission.   Lord Bertie reports that the French (ioverninent have  proposed  that the Anglo-French Conference, which is  not  to be  confused with the Allied War Conference,should take place next week at Boulogne.    The  British  Government  have  appointed  Mr. Austen  Chamberlain,   LordBuckmaster, and General Smuts to represent Great Britain on the Inter-Ally Council,the first task of which will be to endorse and present to the  United States government programme of the Allies&apos; requirements in munitions, food, and other supplies  overas long a period as circumstances  will allow.    ddie French Government on  18th October decided to co-operate with Great Britainand  the  United   States  in the imposition  of  an  embargo  on  all exports  to  the scandinavian States and Holland, and commercial cable facilities  have  been refusedover  French wires, in  the case of Dutch telegrams, in conformity  with the british policy.    Italy and  China  have  now been invited to join in  the  embargo against theNorthern Neutrals.
                                    FRANCE.  -  Since his majority of 57 in the Chamber referred to last week (vide Report No. 38rpage 7), M. Painleve improved his position  by securing majorities  of  119 on  18thOctober, and 272 on the. following day.  He felt, however, that his position- was lesssecure  than  these  later figures seemed to indicate, and  on 22nd October, after  aCabinet Conned, presented the collective resignation  of his Ministry to the President-of the Republic.  The resignation was not accepted as President  boiucare pointedout that the last division in the Chamber had given the Ministry a substantial majority.On this, all Ministers placed  their resignations in the hands  of M. Painleve in order-to facilitate the task of reconstruction.   In spite  of  the ambitions of M. Thomas tobe put  in  charge either of the  Quai  d&apos;Orsay  or of the  Ministry of War, the  onlychange made was to substitute M. Barthou, -who previously  had.  held  no portfolio, forthe aged M. Ribot as  Minister  for Foreign Affairs.  All  the  other Ministers have-resumed the offices they had resigned.    Lord. Bertie points out  that  it was M. Barthou, when Prime Minister in 1913,  whorestored the term of military  service from two years  to three.  He was also one of theprincipal witnesses detrimental to the Caillaux interest in the Calmette murder trial, andis in favour of continuing  the Avar and of  preventing French Socialists from going to stockholm,  ddie Socialists and a section of the Radical Socialists are hostile to him.    The Chamber adjourned until. 25th  October, when, Lord Bertie is informed, it will consider  the  Franco-British  Military Service Agreement,  and.  M. Renaudel  hassummoned a meeting  of the Socialist Party to consider the  advisability of refusingsupport to any Ministry which Avill not accept in their entirety the resolutions  of theSocialist Congress at Bordeaux (vide Report No. 38, page 7).    On 24th October, Messieurs Pierre Lenoir and Desouches,  two of the co-proprietorsof &quot; Le Journal &quot; Avhose trustworthiness has long been suspected, by Senator Humbert,were arrested, as accomplices of Boio, for  commerce  with the enemy.                                     ITALY.    The Italian Chamber  re-assembled  on 16th October.   Mr.  Erskine reports  that although a hostile motion was defeated by a very large majority, the position  of theCabinet is critical owing to  the general dissatisfaction  with the Prime Minister,Signer Boselli, who  is  considered to  be  too old  and to  lack energy.  The BritishCharge d&apos;Affaires considers it probable that Baron Sonnino, who  does  ail he  can tosupport his Chief, will continue to  be Minister for Foreign Affairs in the event of  anyreconstruction or change of Administration.    Mr.  Erskine reports   that in.  view of  this  year&apos;s  crop  shortage,  the ItalianGovernment have considered it advisable to  divert  374,000  tons  of  shipping tothe  service of the grain trade  in  order to  increase  the monthly  imports of grainby  120,000 tons.   Against this the import of coal will be reduced by at least 100,000tons, and possible\r more, as the supply of ore to Great Britain,  in. return  for whichcoal was allowed to Italy, has also  been diminished.                                     SERBIA.    In  view of  the beneficial effect upon the moral of the  Serbian Army which isexpected  from  the arrival  in  Macedonia, of the First Serbian Division from theBessarabian Front, the War Office considers that the transfer  should  be continued inspite of  the Rumanian representations made in a contrary sense (vide Report  No. 37,.page 9).                                    GREECE.    Lord Granvilie considers that the  Note of 1st  September promising  the same powers to the British Naval Mission as to the French Military Mission is not enough in itself, and that care must be taken that the promises given be  actually carried outin the  Contract.  Further, the Minister is  of  opinion that if the British GovernmentAvish the British Mission to have the same status  in and  authority and control  overthe Greek  Navy as the French Mission  has over  the  Greek  Army it will  be necessaiyto increase the numbers of the Mission considerably.    It appears from Lord Granville&apos;s telegram referring to  the opbnions expressed bythe Naval and Commercial Attaches on the subject that his action  in tacitly assentingto the  claim advanced by Fiance that  she  should have exclusive Port Control  withinher.naval zone,  may affect the liberty of action of the British  Naval Mission,  and is
not entirely in accordance with  the  instructions  sent by the Foreign Office.   Repre-sentations  made  privately in  Athens  tend  to show  that  the French government regard the affair as settled.    Lord Granville learns that M. Venizelos will he obliged to postpone  his departure from Athens  as  the  food  situation is  most serious, and the complete lack of flourwhich is expected may easily lead to disturbances.    Lord Granville  is informed  by  the British Consul  at Janina that on 21st october the  Italian Civil and Military  authorities were  still  being maintained  at,  Konitza,pending the evacuation by the Greeks, in  favour  of  the Italians,  of  the village  ofPreso.yani.  The  Greek officer commanding  in this district asserts that the Italianshave put forward new proposals for the  modification of the Grieco-Italian spheres  inEpirus on lines unfavourable to Greece.    Greek  civil authorities and gendarmes have been established, in the Santi Quarautatriangle, which, is  still  under the  accepted  military occupation of the Italians, andnew Greek gendarmes liave been sent into the  district (vide Report No. 38, page 8).                          ENEMY  ALLIED  AFFAIRS.    Sir W. Townley refers  to the proposals of  Dr.  Kohler,  a German  official  in.  theOttoman Ministry of Public Works, for the construction of a Rasovo-Constanza Canalfrom the Danube to the Black Sea,  through what he hopes will be  Bulgarian  territoryafter the war.  This would enable submarines,  destroyers,  and other craft to passunnoticed and unchallenged from the North Sea to the  Black  Sea,  and even further,and would thus make Germany independent of  the Mediterranean.   Dr.   Kohlercalculates that water-borne traffic for Constantinople passing down the Danube would save 30 hours and 400 kilometres by the construction of this canal.    Herr von Kuhlmann, when speaking at Budapest, was emphatic  in asserting thathe would not be party to an economic war to be waged after the conclusion of actualhostilities.                               GERMAN AFFAIRS.    The progressive deterioration of the political position of Dr. Michaelis is indicatedpartly by  the vigour of the  Parliamentary and Press  campaign in  Germany against his retention  in office  and partly by the storm signals successively hoisted  by theGovernment as a result of that campaign.  The editor of a Danish newspaper who hasnow returned, to Copenhagen, reports that when  in Berlin he attended a debate in. theReichstag, during which Herr Ledebour  threatened  the  Government in a most uncompromising manner and asserted that the people wanted  bread and peace at any cost.  The report  of this  was  suppressed by the censorship, but  the  &quot; Vorwarts &quot;stated that in order to  save  the Chancellor, Dr. Helfferich, as well as Admiral  von Capelle was to  be  thrown to the  wolves.  This was  on 17th October.  Three  days later  Sir  11. Rumbold  heard from a diplomatic source that this  sacrifice was  not considered adequate to stay  the  appetite  of the wolves  and that the Chancellorhimself was destined for the same  fate as his  subordinates.  Should this actually be the case, Prince  von bulow is again to  become Chancellor, while Herr von Kuhlniann is expected to succeed Dr. von Helfferich, and Herr  von Stum no  will step into  the Secretaryship of State  for  Foreign Affairs, vacant through  Herr  von  Kuhlmann&apos;s promotion.  It is  thought that this combination may, perhaps, simultaneously satisfy both the Pan-Germans and the Majority Party in the Reichstag.     dffie Prussian Chambers  met on 18th October, and in the  opening speech in the Upper Idouse Count Arnifn  von  Boitzenburg animadverted strongly on American attempts  to break  the  ties between the Prussian people and its ruling dynasty.  He asserted  that such attempts were doomed  to  failure and that the German people will not allow B:ismarck&apos;s  work  of unity to  be undone, but will  reject angrily  and energetically this attempt at outside interference in her internal affairs.     Sir  If. Rumbold reports  that  in conversation Mgr. Marchetti, the Papal  Nuncio to Munich, told  him  that while Germany for  the most part  had  by now given  up hope  of keeping Belgium, the line  taken  by President Wilson in  refusing to make peace with the Hohenzollerns was only calculated to make the Germans more stubborn, as  they are strongly opposed to submitting to  foreign  dictation in  their own  affairs. ddie Nuncio  even  suggested that if   outside  attacks  on the dynasty were to be abandoned the non-military elements in Germany would be greatly strengthened and the Pan-Germans would be no longer able to resist their pressure.     Sir M. Findlay, however, reports in a directly contrary  sense on the authority of a Norwegian General  who  has  first-hand information  from what he considers a  sure
source.   According to these  advices there is  a strong and rapidly  growing feelingboth among civilians and  among the rank and fde of the Army, that  the Allies willrefuse to treat with the present regime, and that  the  only chance for the future ofGermany  is  a democratic  peace  with disarmament and without  annexations  asadvocated by Seheidemann.  This feeling is increased by  the estrangement which in.many cases  lias sprung up  between the German  officers  and men, which, has  been intensified  by the preferential  treatment  accorded to officers during the prolongedstationary warfare,   ddiis tension is expected to increase until the civil and militarypopulation, break loose and  force the Government, to which  the  majority  of theofficers still  adhere in their hopes of securing a &quot; German Peace,&quot; to give the truerepresentation of national, feeling.   That the Government will have to do this is inevitable unless it wishes to run the risk  of a revolution possibly even this winter.   The comments and explanations  of  the  German  Press  make it  clear  that the seventh German War Loan, in spite of the apparently favourable financial positionof the  country (vide  Report No.  38, page  10) is not likely  to  be a  triumphantsuccess.   ddie recent Socialist Conferences have adopted a new programme  of party aims forthe future.  The Socialists have  decided to abandon their negative attitude in Germanpolitical life, and Herr Scheidemann&apos;s speech  at Wurzburg indicates that the Partyintends to seek power in order to put in force  a constructive policy for the rebuilding of the  German Empire after the war.    He demands  the parliamentarization anddemocratization of government,  and for this purpose advocates the application of theReichstag electoral law for elections in Federal States.  He calls for  the  reduction oftaxation and  a fundamental  duty on  the  wealth and monopolies of Germany.   HerrLandsberg asserted  that  the hatred felt  by  the world  for Germany could only beconjured if the German people  took upon itself  to  decide as  to its own fate in thefuture.                            BULGARIAN A FFAIRS.   The Intelligence Bureau&apos;s Weekly Report on Bulgaria for .19th October clraAvsattention to the manner in which the Bulgarian Government makes use of its leadingmen in the formerly pro-Ally Opposition camp in  order to keep in touch with Alliedsentiment,  especially in America,  and create an.  impression  that a  reconciliationbetween the Allies and Bulgaria might be possible.  It sums up these manoeuvres asfolloAvs :--   &quot;None  of these  Opposition leaders, politicians or agents are, in fact, to be trusted.       They  are  neither  Germanophil nor  Ententophil  in policy, Avhatever  their       sentiments are.   They are frankly in favour of a  greater Bulgaria dictating       the policy of their diminished and exhausted  neighbours, and  that policy wdll       be based, they ho]pe, on the situation  in  which Bulgarian friendship Avill be       sought by, both great  groups  of PoAvers  in.  Europe.   A separate peace       engineered by them, in fact,  would  not be  a peace which separated Bulgaria       from the Central  Powers, but merely  a j)eace which separated the Entente       Powers from their three Balkan Allies,  leaving Bulgaria  in the happy position       of being able to dictate  her  own  policy  and to play  one group  of Powers       against the other.&quot;                                NETHERLANDS.   The Dutch Government  are  considerably exercised by  the  suspension of com-mercial  cable  facilities,  and have  offered to  stop  the  export  of  sand and  gravelafter Germany&apos;s requirements have been satisfied.  They have, hoAvever, been informedthat  the stoppage  must be not only absolute but  immediate, and Lord Robert Cecilhinted that Holland  might  be subjected  to  post-war  economic reprisals.   Sir  W.Townley reports  that  there  is a hitch in the  negotiations with Germany, and thatHolland  has declined  at  present  to ratify  the recent  Coal  Agreement with thatcountry.   He  has been confidentially informed that the Dutch are trying to introduce a clause providing for the stoppage of the sand and  gravel export into this agreement,and that this action has caused the delay.    4073-i                ,             c
   Sir W. Townley reports  that on  23rd October  the  Dutch  Minister for ForeignAffairs made a  statement in the Lower House  in which  lie contrived  to mix up thequestions of the metal transit and that of sand and gravel so as to get a vote ofconfidence for the action of the Government.   Everyone supports the Government intheir  attitude on the  metal  question, while general opinion  is in favour of GreatBritain in her demand for the stoppage of sand  and gravel,  ddie  British Minister,.in support of Ins suggestion  that the Foreign Office  should issue a statement clearljrdefining  the facts of the case, desires to point  out  that  the question  is one  of  very long standing, and  that the Minister for Foreign Affairs,  after stating in August  1916that 75,000 tons would be maximum of  gravel  and sand to  be exported monthly,suddenly raised the figure  to 420,000 tons a mouth after consultation with a Germanofficial, and omitted to mention the increase either to the British or the French Minister.   Sir 0, Spring Rice reports  that  the  War  Trade Board, the new and enlarged-edition of the  old  United  States  Exports Board, has intimated, to the NetherlandsMission  in Washington that it cannot license the  export of foodstuffs, fodders, orother commodities when such articles are to be  used  for export to the Geutral Empires,or for the release of similar  articles to be so exported, or for the production of  anyarticles  for export to the Central Empires, or for  the  transport through or acrossHolland  of war  materials  of enemy origin or ownership  being sent  directly to theenemy in the field.   The Board has pointed out  that if Holland continues  to supply the equivalent  of a. large  part of the ration of  the German. Army the United Statescannot be expected to supply Holland with what she wants or help  her to  obtain it.Further, as there is no guarantee as to the destination of their cargoes after arrival in.Dutch ports, no bunkers will be granted to Dutch ships now in United States ports.                                SWITZERLAND.   In view of the irritation caused among the Swiss at the suspension, by order of theAllies, of  their transit facilities from Holland through Germany  (vide Reports No. 33,page 11, and No. 38, page 12), Sir II.  Rumbold  suggests  that his negotiations forsecuring a loan from the Swiss Government would he materially  facilitated  if he wereto be  empowered  to announce the repeal of the suspension order  as a preliminarydouceur.   Sir  M. Findlay announces that  since the  application  of the  Allied,  embargo,preparations have been  made very largely to increase the imports into Norway from switzerland through Germany.  He asks  that  immediate attention may be  given  tothis striking development of Swiss transit trade.                                NORWAY.   Sir M. Findlay reports that great indignation has been aroused by the news of thedestruction of the Scandinavian Convoy by German surface-ships.  At first the BritishGovernment was as much abused in the  local Press for having neglected to provide an adequate escort for the Convoy,  as were the Germans for having sunk Norwegianships and murdered  neutral  seamen even after they had taken to their boats.   even after  consideration of  the unofficial representations made indirectly  by the british minister  the  Press  continues to  regard British  prestige as  having been greatlydiminished by the incident.   Sir  M. Findlay  reports  that the  Minister for Foreign Affairs  expressed,  hisgratitude for the gallant action of  H.M.S. &quot; Strongbow &quot; and HALS. &quot; Mary Rose &quot;in their defence of  the Scandinavian  convoy, and stated  that  the German Charged&apos;Affaires had just protested  against the indignant criticisms  of  German brutality inthat  action which are now.appearing in the whole of the Norwegian Press.   According to &quot;The Times &quot; an  order has been issued establishing heavy penalties for all kinds of illegal communication of  news for the  benefit of  a belligerent Power.This is generally approved as public opinion is convinced that the German attack  onthe Scandinavian convoy was in consequence of information furnished by spies in norway.   Sir M. Findlay and the United States Minister to Christiania are both unfavourablyimpressed by the weakness in  negotiation shown by  the American authorities  in
dealing with Dr. Narisen on the subject of the stoppage of Norwegian fish exports toGermany and the rationing of Norway in cereals.  Both deplore the facility  withwhich the official negotiators allow themselves to be side-tracked into the consideration-of details leading to  the conclusion of  piece-meal  agreements.   The  British minister is convinced that Dr. Nansen is bluffing  the United States Government, and contends,that the stoppage of all. fish imports to Germany, so far from being &quot;impossible,&quot; asthe Norwegians  pretend, is actually  essential to the salvation of the native fisheries ifthe United.  States will but demand, it and refuse to supply oil or other commoditiesuntil the demand be accepted and  the export be effectively stopped.  The Ministerdisposes of the laboured  arguments  put  forward by  the  Norwegians in. hopes  of preserving  their  lucrative traffic with the  Central Empires, and again points out thatin the oil  supply lies the weapon  which will enable  the United States  to  induceNorway  to refuse exports of all. kinds to the Enemy Empires.   Sir M. Eindlay understands that Dr. Nansen, who. finds difficulty in negotiating in washington, is  anxious  to  bring his mission to&apos; a close, and suggests  that total prohibition  of exports to  Germany may be secured if,  in.  dealing wdth Dr. Nansen,proper use be made  of the recent attack upon the Scandinavian convoy.   The Ministerknows that  Dr. Nansen personally considers that the supply to  Germany of food and.munition stuffs which-are  used for  the murder of Norwegians is  incompatible Withthe  honour of  his country.   Further, in  view of  German machinations  immediate action by the United States on lines already indicated is essential.    Sir .Vh Findlay makes  suggestions, which, if adopted, will  enable Norway to saveher  face before the world,  and at the  same time  yield  to the pressure of the Alliedembargo, and prohibit all exports  to Germany.  lie proposes  that  a  Decree  shouldbe published when  Norway has agreed  to bow  to the Allied demands,  prohibitingall  exports  of  whatever  kind from  Norway, except  for  reasons of  compensation.Agreements would  then  be  signed with  the  Allies and the United  States, grantingthem dispensations  from  the  Prohibition  of  Export for certain articles required bythem  in return  for  commodities  essential,  for   Norway&apos;s  existence.  This  would facilitate the regulation of die difficult problem of the control of Norwegian exports toother neutral countries.    Sir M. Findlay,  in reply to the inquiry of  the  Foreign Office, considers that themost desirable moment for the termination of  the Fish Agreement  is the  earliest-possible moment.   The Coalition Cabinet has now finally been constituted, and the following ministers were sworn in. on 19th October :     In order to qualify under the existing law for his  office  in  the  new Cabinet, Mr.Branting had to satisfy the Ecclesiastical authorities  of bis parish that he  is  not  adissenter from the Established Church of Sweden.   The new Prime Minister, on taking office,  made a  statement to the King on thesubject of the Coalition programme.  This comprises the maintenance of unswervingand  impartial  neutrality  and  a  commercial policy  in accordance  therewith, thedevelopment of  special co-operation  between  the  Scandinavian Kingdoms,  approvalof all  efforts  towards the establishment after the  war of an  International JudicialOrganisation calculated to safeguard peace and lead to  gradual disarmament.  in internal  politics the  Coalition  proposes&apos;  to  reform  the  Communal  Franchise andintroduce a measure of Female Suffrage.SWEDEN.Prime MinisterMinister of finance minister for Foreign.

   Sir E. Howard reports that the composition of the new Administration is approved-wholeheartedly only by the Socialists.  The Liberals are rather  afraid of their four-colleagues in the Cabinet and the Conservative Press is, somewhat naturally, openlyhostile.   Sir E. Howard,  on learning that Mr. Hellner is unlikely to retain M.r. Westman as secretary-General  at the Foreign  Office, hinted that Baron  Ramel, the pro-GermanSwedish Minister in Christiania, would  not  be a persona grata  to the Allies  as his successor.   The British Vice-Consul at Haparauda  reports that smuggling from Finland intoSweden is on the increase and that those interested in this traffic  make no  attempt atany  concealment of their activities  which   are  carried on apparently with  theconnivance of the well-bribed. Russian frontier guards at Tornea.   Sir E. Howard  reports that, the  fate  of  the  Scandinavian Convoy  has provokedhostile comment against Germany  only in  Socialist journals and considers that the disaster  may reduce the confidence  in our patrols which had been growing of late-among Swedish shipowners.   According to Sir E. Howard, Germany  is anxious to sell her aniline dyes to  GreatBritain through Sweden, and an attempt is  likely to be made to unload  these upon.the United Kingdom by  falsely  representing that  they had  been sold  to Swedishpurchasers before the war.   I)i view of the request  of  the United States Government the Swedish  diplomaticbags   (vide  Reports No. 38,  page  13,  and   No.  35, page 10)  have been  handedover&quot;unopened to the Swedish Minister  in Washington.   The  Swedish Minister has,however, beeu advised that this surrender does not constitute a precedent and that theBritish Government do not bind themselves  to abstain from seizing and opening hisbags  if  considered suspicious.  The  bags  have  been surrendered  solely out  of consideration for the convenience of the United States Government,  and  the BritishGovernment, in  so doing, has been influenced by the change of Ministry in Sweden.                                  DENMARK.   Difficulties  ami. complications continue to delay the  arrival  at  a  satisfactory settlement between Denmark and the  Allies.   The Danes  are  under agreement withGermany to export 5,000 head of live  cattle per week, and this  export  is  necessaryin view of the shortage of fodders and absence  of  other  outlets.   Germany declinesto take dead meat, consequently Denmark cannot export  4,000 hides per  quarter  to approved destinations.  In view of this the Foreign Office has communicated certain.final, proposals to  Sir 0. Spring Rice for the consideration of the  United  states authorities.   According to  these, Denmark  may  export  5,000   head  of   cattle,  or equivalent  cattle  meat, weekly to Germany,  but no other exports of agricultural,.animal, or dairy produce, or horses may be made to the Central Empires ; all  surplusof.dairy and pig products must be exported to  the  Allies, and all surplus of hides,including those now in stock in Denmark, must be exported to approved destinations.It is thought that the  Danish Government may be able to  accept  these terms, althoughfurther difficulties  on the subject of the horses are possible.   Sir R. Paget reports that in virtue of  the new arrangements for rationing butterin Denmark, which works  out at about  half a pound per head weekly, the  home consumption will he  limited to some  40,000 tons per annum, thus leaving 40,000 tonsavailable for export.   The Minister for Foreign Affairs has asked Sir R. Paget whether Denmark will  beallowed to  have  any additional  coal she can fetch over  and  above her  presentallowance of 100,000 tons monthly if a loan Le granted to  the British Government.                                     SPAIN. .   The British Ambassador draws attention to the publication of the message sent bythe Military Juntas to the King of Spain on 17th June last.   The message attacks therotativist political system and is of  the nature of an ultimatum to the King dictated by political forces, hostile not only to&apos; the existing Spanish. Administration, but to the-
                                    JAPAN.    Sir G. Buchanan suggests  that a small  Japanese force, to act as a.  disciplinednucleus, would  be of  value on  the  Russian  front,  and in that position  no  greatdislocation of tonnage would be required for  its transport and maintenance.    Sir  C. Spring Rice  advises the Foreign  Office that, after  consultation with  theFrench. Ambassador in  Washington, he  is  of opinion that the price likely  to  be demanded  by public opinion in Japan  in return  for Japanese  military assistance tothe Allies  would,  probably take the shape  of a  demand   for  formal,  recognition of japanese  claims in China and  the Far Past.   These, in the opinion of the  twoAmbassadors, would not  meet  with public  approval  in the United States, and  theAmerican Government might have to decline lo grant recognition.                                     CHINA.    Sir J. Jordan reports that the Russian Minister has formally reserved  the right to protest to the Chinese Government against any  increase  of the  Chinese  Tariff along the land frontier with. Russia.  This amounts in principle to a Russian disclaimer of participation in the increased tariff burden, as the Russian sea-borne trade is negligible.In view of the  change  in  conditions of transit the British Minister suggests that thespecial tariffs which have been established by various treaties in the past  should nowbe,put on the new  tariff basis.   With&apos;.this view- the French  and  Japanese Ministersconcur so far as their personal opinion, is concerned.    Jdie United  Slates Minister in.  Peking believes that several members of the presentChinese Administration are entirely under Japanese influence, and considers that the&quot;Arms  Alliance&quot;  between  Japan  and  China will   greatly  increase  Japaneseinfluence.   The  contract  placed  in  Japan   is  for  40,000  rifles  and  300  field and machine  guns,  continues  the  appointment of Japanese  Military  Advisers,and grants a concession for the working  of a valuable iron  mine  near Nanking.According to the  Chinese Vice-Minister for  War  the Government had no  option  inthe matter as  a refusal  to  grant the contract would, have meant the  transfer  of japanese sympathy and support to the Cantonese Party in the South,                                 ARGENTINA.   Sir R, dower has notified the Argentine Government that the British safe-conductfor Count Lux burg will, be available  by the Dutch steamer &quot; Holland ia,&quot; which is dueto leave Buenos Aires for New  York  and Halifax about 20th November..   Sir G. Spring Rice reports that the  War  Trade Board in the United  States hasinformation showing that the  Germans  have prepared  plans  for   the   wholesaleconsolidation, of German commercial  interests in the Argentine, Chile, and  Uruguayafter the war.  The present economic policy  of: the  United States is directed towardsthe destruction of the German control of these interests, which the War Trade  Boardhopes to get-taken over by the  Governments  of the  Republics concerned.   Sir  C.  Spring Pice  learns that  the  War Trade  Board has recommended thepurchase by the United States of 45,000,000 bushels of maize and oats, and  40,000,000    4073-1                             UConstitution  itself.  The  British Ambassador  learns that the Catalan Home Ruler,Sen or Cambu, is the power behind Colonel Alarquez and the Military Juntas.   The British Ambassador has received unofficial information that the German replyto the.Spanish Note.demanding the.return of the German submarine  which escapedfrom  her internment at Cadi/,  is evasive and  unsatisfactory,  but  that: the SpanishGovernment have intimated further that if the submarine be not returned to Cadiz, theGerman Ambassador will be returned lo Berlin.   According to Sir A.  Hardinge the Minister of War, who resigned on 1.7th Octoberon account of age, has been succeeded  by General Marina.   Lord  Bertie  reports  that  Signor  Bonin,  the Italian Ambassador in Madrid, will.shortly leave in order to succeed Signor Salvage Raggi as Ambassador in Paris.
bushels of wheat in the Argentine.   This proposal,  has been made on account of theaction of the United States Government in preventing the sale of Argentine grain tothe Northern Neutrals,  and  by way  of  compensation  for this compulsory  loss ofcustom. ( Mr. MaeOorinick  is opposed   to the purchase  of. maize  and oats, as theUnited States already have a surplus of these grains.                                  URUGUAY.   The British Government has informed Uruguay that a safe-conduct, subject to theusual conditions as  to route, destination and right of search,  will be granted to theformer German Minister and German Consular officers de carrier e, together with those members of their families who arc not males of military age.                                    BRAZIL.   .   Sir A. Peel draws attention to  the  political position of the Minister  for  ForeignAffairs who,  as  a. strong Anglophil, has  been instrumental in securing the use ofBrazilian  ports to the British Navy, I he use of  ex-German, ships in. Allied trade, andthe refusal of the officially controlled  Brazilian Lloyd  to  handle cargo from  firms on.the Statutory List.    According  to  Sir  A. Peel the  Minister  is  encountering greatopposition from prO-Geriuau interests and from, the State Governments of  Para, Bahia,and Amazon as, and there is reason to fear that a cabal  has been  formed against him inGovernment  circles.   The  Minister himself  is greatly depressed,  and  fears  that theaction of Great Britain  in.  confining  the carriage  of  Brazilian coffee  to ex-german ships will so  undermine his prestige when, communicated  to  the  Chamber  that his political  opponents  will, be able  to force him to resign.  Sir  A. Peel  urges theimportance to the Allied cause of enabling the Minister to retain  bis present positionand asks the  Foreign Office to consider the question.                                     01 JILL,   The Foreign  Office  complains  to  Sir  0. Spring Rice that  the Dupont PowderCompany  proposes to pay one-third of the purchase price of the  nitrate properties inChile  direct to  the  German  interests in Valparaiso,  which procedure  is entirelycontrary to the  proposals  for which. British  approval was obtained (vide ReportsNo.  33, page 1.6/and No. 8.1, page 13).                                     PPRU.   The Foreign Office has instructed  Mr.  Ronnie to convey official assurances to thePeruvian Government that Or eat Britain  cordially  welcomes the adhesion of Peru tothe ever increasing number of States which, have  openly manifested  their sympathy with the Allied  cause by breaking off diplomatic  relations with Germany.  At thesame time it lias been decided that as His Majesty the King did not publicly send anypersonal message of congratulation to the President, either of  Brazil  or  of  Uruguayon the occasion of rupture with. Germany, it would  be invidious to make  an exceptionin the case of Peru.   The pleasure felt by His Majesty at the course taken by Peru is,however, to be communicated privately by Mr. Ronnie to the President.                                    MEXICO,   The American  Ambassador has applied to Mr. Cummins, whose long residence inMexico lias provided him with better sources of information, for  particulars about theactivities in Mexico of the &quot; Independent Workers  of  the World &quot; who  are generallyunderstood  to  be  inspired  by German agents.   According to  a  telegram  sent  by
&quot;Mr. Cummins  on 19th October there is every  reason to believe that German agents have arranged for this organisation to bring about a general strike throughout Mexico towards the end of the month in order to paralyse the railways.  At meetings of the &quot; Independent Workers of the World &quot; German propaganda is preached, and by other means  the  Germans are impressing  upon General  Carranza that Mexico can  save Germany by  declaring war  on the  Allies,  and, notably, the United  States.  The General has obtained  authorisation  from  Congress  to suspend  the constitutional guarantees  and has  appointed a  violent pro-German  as  Minister  for  War.  Lord-Cowdray&apos;s representative  in  Mexico  considers that  there  is every indication  of  a coming movement for seizing Allied interests in the country under  the provisions  of the new Constitution, and the British  Minister points out that the  suspension of the constitutional guarantees wdiich  came into force  on 20th October  exposes  persons and corporations to malevolent  persecution, on the mere  suspicion,  of not being  in-accord with the Mexican Government.    Mr. Cummins learns that General Carranza is preparing to abandon  Mexico City, and that there is every  probability  of  his withdrawing his capital and administration to  Tampico.  This move  is probably inspired by  the  Germans, as the position  is reported to be defensible, on the landward side, while the control of the oil wells and the taxes from the same would be secured, and the wells themselves menaced with immediate  destruction  were  a naval attack imminent.   Representations  on  this subject  have  been made  to  Washington by the Foreign  Office as  the greatest importance is attached to the oil supply from the Tampico district.   , Sir C. Spring Rice reports that the State Department is  confident that  Carranza will be unable to occupy the Tampico area  in sufficient  force to be dangerous.  It  is recognised, however, that the  lower  class Mexicans  are pro-German on account  of their dislike for the United States.  The State  Department has information that oneof the lieutenants of Relaez is working to undermine  the authority- of his chief with the party, and that Pelaez, in consequence of this, may make terms with  Carranza.    The position of Pelaez-  appears to be that  he has every intention of remaininghostile to Carranza.   If the latter receives American subsidies Pelaez has announced his  intention  of regretfully  becoming a pro-German.    If,  on  the  other hand, Carranza sides with Germany, Pelaez  is prepared to embrace the Allied cause.    Mr.  Cummins learns that the Mexican  Government intend to raise  a  boundarydispute as to the frontier of  British Honduras and projwse to appoint a  commissionto  examine the  question.   The Minister considers that  this may be deliberatepreparation of  a  bone of  contention to be  produced  when required for  ulteriordiplomatic motives.  Mr. Cummins reports that military measures are being concerted by  the Government against Pelaez (vide Reports No. 34-, page 12,  and No. 35, page 14),and against the rebels in San Luis de Potosi.    ddie British Minister refers to the effect of pio-German propaganda among the menof  the &quot;Mexican Army,  who now openly assert  that the pre-occupations of the UnitedStates in Europe will give Mexico her  opportunity  for recovering the territories lost in 18-19.  They also express the  opinion that Great Britain robbed  Mexico  of british honduras.  &quot;This,  taken in  conjunction wdth  the new-born official interest  in thecommon boundary between the Republic and the Colony, is worthy of remark.  At thesame time pro-Ally speeches are being made to the  Mexican Congress.  The UnitedStates Ambassador considers that this  is indicative of  the urgent need, of a  loan fromthe United States, but Mr. Cummins suggests that it is due to Carranza&apos;s desire toplay for time, as he is  convinced that the  anti-American  and pro-German interests have united to precipitate events.    According  to  Mr.  Cummins,  Sehor Iturbide has  been  arrested,  and  Britishintervention on his behalf  is suggested as  Mexican detestation, of the United states would probably  be visited upon the prisoner were Washington to make representations-on  the subject.  It may be remembered  that  a large section of the native Indiumpopulation of  Mexico consider that  the Iturbide family now  represents the formerRoyal. House of the Aztec sovereigns, and that less than  a century ago  AugustinIturbide actually became Emperor of Mexico for a few months on the strength of thatrepresentation, while the Emperor Maximilian recognised an Iturbide  as  the  heir  tohis Crown in 1.860.                               UNITED  STATES.    Legal difficulties have arisen which prevent the British Government from accepting the draft of the Military Service Agreement with the United States, as it conflicts wdth      4073-4                              B
the Act of Parliament which governs the making  of Conventions with Allied States-In view of this the Foreign Office has submitted to the Ambassador in London a new draft for  an Agreement, which enables the British  Government  to  remain within.the provisions of the Act.                            S IdiPPI N G SIT CATION.    According  to  the War Trade Intelligence Report, the  total, tonnage  of  500 tons-gross in the case of steamers and 100 tons gross in the case of sailing ships reported lost owing to the malice of the King&apos;s enemies during the period 12th October to18th October inclusive is 103,903 tons, of which 46,857 tons were British, as comparedwith 73,256 tons, of which 45,541 tons were British, reported last week.    The proposals for the further employment of Japanese shipping in.  the interestsof the  Allies and the United. States are momentarily delayed on the cjuestion  of whatcharter money is to be paid.  The  position at present is that of 70 steamers of about250,000  tons  available,  20 steamers of  100,000  tons are  already chartered to  theAllies.   The United States are negotiating for the remaining 50 ships of 150,000 tonsand have offered  11. 2s. as a  charter  rate.   The Japanese shipowners ask for 21,Discussions are in progress on this  point  between the  shipowners and  the JapaneseMinister of Communications, who has power  under the recently published ImperialOrdinance to requisition ships and  fix charter rates.    Sir F. Stronge reports that the Chilean Government are ready to undertake not topay any  charter money to Germany until after the war, and to release an equivalentnumber of ships now employed on the American trade for use in the European trade-if Great Britain will agree to allow Chile to make  use of.  the German  ships IIOAV in.Chilean, harbours.  Great Britain  is prepared  to  approve of the proposal providedthat the  employment be of sufficient benefit to the Allies or the United States.    Sir R. Paget reports  that Danisli shipowners would  on no  account  be willing to-agree  to  bind  themselves  to prolong charters after  the war (vide Report  No. 38,page 18).  In  view of this the British Minister  suggests  that  the Danish Governmentbe approached with oilers of shipbuilding materials in return for post-war charters ofsome of the 900,000  tons of shipping under the Danish Hag.                             PEACE  DISCUSSIONS.   The delegates to the Stockholm. Socialist Conference from the Scandinavian States,...Netherlands and Spain, have put forward a Peace Formula with which they claim the delegates from Russia and Belgium agree.  The formula which, has been communicated.to an American Journalist demands       (a) Evacuation  of European and  Colonial  territories and  their restoration to            previous owners.   Complete restablishment of the political  liberty and            independence, and  territorial integrity which  any nation may have lost            in whole or in part during the war.   Friendly agreements as  to reetifica-            tions  of frontiers  will, however, be permitted where the populations            concerned desire the change.      (6) No  indemnities,  but  impositions and  taxes raised in conquered territory            contrary to the provisions of the Hague Ooinrentions may be refunded.      (c) Restoration of devastated territories at international, expense.     (cl) Solution  of national  questions, liberty of nationalities,  political national            autonomies in which extra national minorities will enjoy cultural liberty,.            all.  to be regulated  by an international tribunal.      (e) General amnesty for all crimes and political offences provoked by the events            of the  war.   Special provisions have been approved in the following cases :      (i) The  cultural autonomy .of  Flanders  and  Wallonia  is  to  be  preserved in            Belgium, and Germany is to repay illegal  requisitions and exactions as            valued by the Hague Tribunal.     (ii) A referendum is to be  held in Alsace-Lorraine on the pre-war register, either-            for the whole of the Reichsland or district by district.
    (iii)  Independent Serbia is to be re-established.    (iv)  An independent Poland is to be created, while Prussian and Austrian Poland            will be granted autonomy.     (v)  The nationalities of  Russia are to enjoy autonomy under the general frame-            work of the Russian Republic with which an independent Finland is to            be united.    fyi)  The Czechs of Bohemia and the Slovak districts of Hungary are to be formed            into a State federated with Austria-Hungary.   &apos;(vii)  Italian-speaking districts,  not  transferred  to Italy,  are to enjoy  cultural            autonomy.   &quot;(viii)  Ireland is to enjoy political  independence and economic equality within the            British Empire.    (ix)  Wishes of  inhabitants  are  to  he consulted as to the  demarcation of the            German frontier in North Schleswig.     (x)  Turkish Armenia is to be territorially re established with guarantees for its            development.    (xi)  Personal  autonomy  is  to  be  accorded to  the Jewish colonies  in  Russia,            Austria, Poland, and Rumania, and.  Jewish colonisation  in. Palestine is to            be protected.   All contracting parties to  these Articles must declare themselves ready to create a  society of  nations on the basis  of   obligatory  arbitration,  general disarmament,suppression of economic warfare, and extension of  Parliamentary control over foreignpolicy.   The Peace terms  advocated  by  the  Sovyet sitting in Petrograd, in  the form of&quot;instructions&quot;  to its  delegate who  is  to accompany the  Russian Foreign  Ministerto the Allied  Conference,  and  published in the  Press, are  not widely  dissimilarfrom  those enumerated  above.   The chief points of difference lie in the absence of wholesale introduction  of autonomies from the Russian terms which also  are cleareras to the future of Armenia and omit reference to Ireland. The Russians also advocate the neutralisation of all straits  leading to inner seas, and of  the Suez  and PanamaCanals, and demand the abolition of the &quot; right &quot; to torpedo merchant vessels in timeof war.  In  addition to these  general  instructions the delegate is ordered to useall possible means to facilitate the meeting of  the Socialist  Conference in Stockholmand. obtain the immediate issue of passports to all. persons anxious to attend it.   In. conversation with  a British diplomatist in Berne, Mgr.. Marchetti,  the PapalNuncio to Bavaria, stated, that the  Germans intended that  Lithuania and Courlandshould be erected into an independent State at the expense of Russia.   He was ofopinion that  Poland would be satisfied with being  left without a seaboard if Dantzicwere to be made a Free Port, and the Vistula, along  which communication  between poland and the Free Port would  pass, neutralised.   The Cardinal. Secretary of State, in a  letter  dated. 28th September to Mr. Lloyd.George, explains the reason of the delay  which occurred in  the  arrival at  the Vaticanof the replies of the Central Empires  to the Papal Peace Note.   He  goes on topoint out that as the  Holy Father was  a  Mediator he did not take upon  himself tosuggest  means  or  methods  but left  it to  the heads  of   States to decide  howsimultaneous  disarmament coxdd be effected.   The  Cardinal, however,  declares  itmust  be  by the suppression  of  compulsory military  service,  by the appointment ofan Arbitration Tribunal for International  questions, and hy the boycott of  any nationdesiring   to   re-establish  compulsory military  service  or refusing  to  submit anInternational question, to the Arbitration Tribunal, or to accept its decision.  The example of England and America proves that the voluntary system gives the necessary contingent to maintain order but does not supply the enormous armies required by modern war.By substituting voluntary for  compulsory  service  amongst  all  civilised  nationsdisarmament  would automatically  be obtained and  an opportunity afforded for thevarious States  concerned to restore their  exhausted finances.   For more than   a century conscrix.)tion has been the real cause of the multitudinous evils afflicting society.Once abolished  it could  only be re-established  by law, and that law would require,even according to the present constitution of Central Empires, Parliamentary consent.Thus  the guarantee of  the  peoples  would be assured.  The  right of peace or war should, moreover, be reserved to the people by referendum  or at least to Parliament.   According to Lord Bertie a very similar letter sent to the Archbishop of Sens hasbeen published in the French Press.
   The Foreign Office has informed Sir IF. Rumbold that no passports will be grantedto enable British subjects to attend the  forthcoming International Peace Conferencein Berne  which is being  promoted  by  the Central Committee of the international organisation for Promoting a Lasting Peace, as it is contrary  to law  for  Britishsubjects in war time to hold any intercourse with enemies.   Hopes  have also been expressed to Lord Bertie that the French Government will take a similar course ofaction.   Sir  H.  Rumbold warns  the Foreign office  that he has  trustworthy information that this Conference has been  arranged  in order to enable the Germans to work onthe Pacifists and Socialists in Italy.                                   GENERAL.    ddie Italian Government are prepared to consent to the export of tinned milk from switzerland for the benefit of Italian prisoners in Austria as proposed by the PapalAgent in Berne (vide Report No. 38, page 20),  provided, that the distribution of the pope&apos;s gift be  controlled by the Papal Nuncio in Vienna.   Sir H. Rumbold suggeststhat in these circumstances British consent to the proposed export should  also begiven, and under the same conditions.    The British Government have informed Denmark that while they fully appreciate the inconvenience caused to the Danish Government by the continued detention of Britishand German prisoners  of  war in * Denmark  they cannot consent  to an exchange ofable-bodied prisoners, as to do so would merely tend to prolong the war.   . Sir W, Townley learns that the Dutch Inspector considers  that the conditions ofthe Officers&apos; Prison Camp at Freiburg  have  been much improved, and that officers,other than those undergoing punishment,  are now  allowed to take walks for  three and a half hours three  times a week.    The Russian Government have declined to recognise the Australian  naturalisationof certain Russians as  having in  any way  derogated from their status  as  Russiansubjects, and insists that those  Australian  Russians  who wish to return to  Russiamustdae provided with Russian passports.
