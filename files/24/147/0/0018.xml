SECRET&apos;.APPRECIATION  OF  THE ATTACHED  WESTERN  ARID  GENERAL                           REPORT,  No.  43.                                IMP mm AL AFFAIRS.   It is interesting to note that the Canadian and Australian  people, at home and inthe trenches, will both be asked to decide the issue of Conscription tor their respective countries  during  next  month.   The difference hi methods is worth noting.   TheCanadian Government passed its  Act first and is now asking for the  support of thepeople in carrying it out.   The Australian Government is asking the people to reversea verdict previously given before  it introduces legislation.                                 ALLIED AFFAIIIS.   The American endorsement of the policy of the Allied Supreme War Councilmakes the success of the scheme certain.  Both Americans and French are for makingthe unity  of  control as far-reaching and  effective  as  possible, but the practicaldifficulties in the way of an actually  unified  chief  command are  being more clearlyrealised in responsible quarters in Paris.                                     FRANCE.                        / -  M. Olemeneeau has launched Ids Government with a great parliamentary triumph,and, for  the  moment at any rate, is carrying ail before  him.  He will thus have agreat chance of consolidating his position before the inevitable flood of  criticism risesagain.                                      ITALY.   The problem of dealing with enemy agents in Italy is now a-question not only ofinternal order, but of the safety of the Anglo-French forces in Italy,   ddie British andFrench  Governments have a very definite justification in claiming that their soldiersshould be protected against the menace in their rear.

PAST  I.-BRITISH  EMPIRE  AND AFRICA.                             IMPERIAL  AFFAIRS.   With reference to  the action which  the British Government propose  to  take, inpursuance of Resolution XIX. of the Imperial War Conference, in order to secure thefreedom of the non-ferrous metal industry from German control (see Report No. 42),the Government  of New Zealand have telegraphed  that they will  be  pleased toco-operate, and that they will be prepared also to  introduce  the necessary legislation at the next favourable opportunity.                                   CANADA.   In  opening his election  campaign  at  Halifax, the Prime Minister (Sir robert borden) stated  that he  was  faced with two alternatives, the one being to leave theCanadian Divisions without support and.  without reinforcements, and the  other toenforce military  service.  He said  that the message he had to  deliver was  &quot;the&quot; overmastering  necessity of sustaining the men who hold Ganada&apos;s first  line of&quot; defence on the  Western front.&quot;  Sir  Robert Borden  announced, that he had made further attempts to  secure  the representation of French-Canadian Liberals in theGovernment, and had recently approached three of them wdth a view to the acceptanceof a position in Pre Cabinet.   He indicated that he intended to continue his efforts inthis direction.    The nomination of  candidates for  election to the House of Commons  has beencompleted.   There have been 19 unopposed returns,  of wdiich. the liberals followingSir W. Laurier have  11 (all  being  in Quebec) and. the  Unionists 8.  Dr. Belaud (whowas Postmaster-General under Sir  W. Laurier)  being a prisoner  of war,  it is  not known  on wdiich side he would stand,  but he is not  being opposed by the supporters of the Union Government,  and is  counted, amongst the Laurier candidates  in  theabove &quot;figures.    Amongst the Government supporters  wdio  have   been   returnedunopposed are Mr.  M. Burrell, Secretary of State, and Mr. W. S. Eielding.    While  it was expected that soldiers serving  oversea would commence voting inthe General -Election  on 20th November, it is now clear that arrangements will  not permit  of  the soldiers  in France and England commencing to vote till 1st December.The voting will  continue up to 17th December as previously announced (vide ReportNo. 41),    The Toronto Board, of Trade, at  a meeting where about half  those present wereformer  supporters  of Sir W. Laurier, has unanimously passed a resolution in supportof the Union Government.    Referring to  the  Government  policy regarding  the  conscription of wealth,  theMinister of Agriculture (Mr. Crerar) has stated that this should be applied to incomes and profits, but not to capital used in production.    The Dominion Government have  decided  to  appoint  a Director  of Public Information in order to furnish  the Press  and the  public with the  fullest possible information  concerning the progress of the war, the operations of the Canadian Naval and Military Forces, the decisions and measures adopted  by the  Government in connection wdth the war, and. the demands of the war as affecting the Dominion.  The Director will act in close co-operation with the War  Committee of  the Cabinet, and will be directly under the Department  of the President of the Privy Council.    With reference to the policy of  building ships for  neutrals during the war (vide Report No. 4-2) the Dominion Government  state  that several  applications are before them for permission  to build ships  for foreign  registry.  As  the Poison Iron Works had not  succeeded  in obtaining orders for the  construction of ships for British registry, the Dominion Government had practically decided  to grant permission to the firm to build 10 steel steamers of about 4,000 tons, for each of  the years 1919, 1920, and 1921, for Norwegian registry, provided the ships were  chartered  during the war to firms approved by the Canadian Government,   Li  view, however,  of the intimation.
that the British Government may  be able  to  place orders,  this  action  has been suspended, but the Dominion Government urge  that  an  early decision  on the  matter is desirable.  Other applications  relate to building for French, Norwegian, UnitedStates, and Italian registry, concerning which the Dominion Government intended to consult the British Government before taking action.  It is  added that several ship-building firms have estimated the  tonnage which  can be produced  in  the Dominionin any one year  as 265,000 tons.  Ministers consider, however, that  having regard to difficulties of securing labour and  material, the  total production would  probably notexceed 175,000 tons.  If the British Government decide  to place orders  to this extent,the Dominion Government undertake to reserve  all facilities.                       AUSTRALIAN  COMMONWEALTH.    In the course of the Proclamation which was issued  on 17th November relating tothe Referendum on Conscription, theCommonwealth Government announced  that inorder to  maintain the  five  divisions  in  Europe   and  the  Australian Forces inPalestine and elsewhere at full strength, 7,000* men per  month were necessary, butthey pledged themselves to the electors  that  the  total reinforcements,  includingvolunteers,  should not exceed this number  per &quot;month,  ddie  Government  furtherentered into definite pledges that the  number of  divisions woidd not  be  increased,that the power asked for would not be exceeded and would be limited to the period ofthe war, that married men would be exempt, and that sufficient labour to carry on thenecessary industries of the conntiy would be maintained.    Speaking upon the Conscription issue at Sydney on  15th November, the PrimeMinister  (Mr.  Hughes)  made  a vigorous  attack upon the Sinn  Feiners and theIndependent Workers  of the World, whom  he  described  as a band of disloyalists.He attributed the failure of voluntary recruiting to their  propaganda work.    Mr.Hughes intimated that if the people endorsed the Governments conscription proposals at the coining Referendum, the BacheloFs Tax would probably  be removed.    The  Premier of  New South  AVales (Mr. Holman) has  declared that  the  StateNational  Party is solidly behind   the  Federal  Government  in their conscriptionproposals.    The  Leader of the  Opposition (Mr. Tudor),  in opening the  anti-conscriptioncampaign, said  that he  would be  no party to  compulsorily sending men out of thecountry.  He  stated that Sir. Hughes  had not said, a word about the conscription of wealth, and instead of such an outcry for human life the  exploiters of  wealth shouldbe conscripted.    It is anticipated  that  the voting  of  the oversea soldiers  in the  ConscriptionReferendum, will commence on 7th December and will, continue till 20th December.    The holding of another Referendum on Conscription  is not viewed with favour by many of the strongest supporters  of the  policy  in  the Commonwealth, who would prefer  to see  a measure of  compulsory service introduced into Parliament with aGeneral Election to  follow.   At  a conscription meeting  of 5,000 people held atS^alney, the Government were asked by resolution to reconsider their decision to holdanother  Referendum.   Sir William  Irvine stated his  belief  that  the taking  of a referendum was  fraught  with peril;  and he  has  declared - himself in favour of aConscription Bill being submitted to Parliament directly it meets, with a clause to theeffect that it should not come into operation until the election of a new Parliament.    In reporting to His Majesty the  King as to  the opening  of the Trans-ContinentalRailway,  the  Governor-General observes  that  this notable addition  to  the  lviug&apos;shighways  opens up new tracts of country, brings  Western Australia  into  closerunity with the  sister States, and by making this State independent of  a sea routeshould aid in releasing  coastal, ships for war service.   His Majesty, in the course ofhis reply, congratulates  his people in Australia  upon the completion   of  this greatnational enterprise.    The  Consul-General for  Sweden at Sydney being  desirous of reopening  the austro-Hungariaii Consulate-General, the Commonwealth Ministers have enquired asto whether permission may be given for enemy consulates to be reopened in the chargeof neutral consuls.    With  regard to  the  production of copper  and  lead,  the  Prime Minister of theCommonwealth telegraphs that, in response to repeated requests to  increase lead outputs,Australia reduced the consignments to the East,  surrendered  the trade which had been           1 Through a clerical error this figure was given as 70,000 in the last Report.
                                NEW ZEALAND.&apos;    The recent activities of raiders in the Pacific has rendered, necessary an additionalIntelligence  Centre, and  the  Admiralty have therefore proposed to  the  dominion government  that  this should be established at Suva and that the  reporting officers at Vila and Ocean Island and in New Zealand should report to the new centre insteadof to Melbourne and Hong Kong as at present.   New reporting officers would also berequired at Fanning Island and Samoa to report to Suva.  The views of the  dominion ministers are invited.1    Having received  information that the  arrangements for  the purchase  of  thepresent seasohs output of butter and cheese are waiting completion in order that itmay  be ascertained  whether  sufficient  ships will   be available,  the  dominion government  have telegraphed that this condition was not put before the producerswhen the offer  of the Food  Controller was accepted  by them.   In consecpience of negotiations  that were  proceeding  between the British and Dominion Governments,the latter prohibited all export of butter and cheese from New- Zealand except to theHnited Kingdom, and  the Dominion Ministers, on behalf of the British authorities,closed the contract with the producers.   In the absence  of the  expected reply fromthe British Government, it is  pointed out that the  producers are meeting wdth greatinconvenience in financing their operations, as they naturally expected that the 90 percent, advance would be arranged as in the case of last  season.  Already, it is  stated,there is a large  quantity  of  butter  and cheese awaiting shipment, and as  there,  are16 ships now loading or to arrive not later than the end of December, the action ofthe Food Controller  is  not  understood.   The Dominion  Ministers  add that  thenegotiations  for the purchase of butter and cheese were opened -as far back as xA.prillast, and the  extraordinary dekvy that has occurred in obtaining a definite decision from the Food Controller  has led to a most acute position in the Dominion, particu-larly wdth regard to the internal finance of the industry,  ddie gravity of the iiosition,the Ministers state, cannot be exaggerated  and has been repeatedly brought to  thenotice of the British authorities by the Dominion Government, and  it is  requested that a definite and satisfactory reply may be sent within the next few days.1 Similar telegrams have been sent to Australia and to the High Commissioner of the Western Pacific.   4297-4                             B                                        5built up at  considerable cost,  and accepted a lower price from tbe British MunitionsDepartment.  All wolfram and molybdenite were also  requisitioned at the requestof the British Government at prices far below American  quotations.   The ElectrolyticRefinery Company, at  the  request  of  the Commonwealth  Government,  increased  itsrefining capacity in order to treat all blister copper produced in Australia, and it nowpossesses the largest electrolytic copper refinery in the Empire.  The Prime Minister,however, points out that the offer of  the British Government  for 700 tons of coppernow due in London is even, lower than that contained in a previous telegram, andthe Commonwealth Government, in pressing the  matter, do so not merely on accountof the 2,000 tons of copper in question, but on the ground of broad Imperial policy.Believing that it  is the desire of  the British authorities to  make  the  Empire self-contained, the  Prime  Minister remarks  that the development of base  metals is  all important, and that while  the miues are only prospecting ventures  to-day, they maybe the chief Australian  producers  in  the future.  He adds that the copper  miners were paid  for  the metal in ore on the  basis of London official quotations,  and thepresent difficulty  is due to the  publication of  fictitious  prices.  As,  however,  theBritish Government have  appointed a non-Ferrous Metal  Committee, it is submittedby the Commonwealth that it will be  a set-back  to pioneer mining  in Australia if apublic notification has to be made that the coxjper output of the pioneering syndicatesof the Electrolytic Company  has been  subjected  to  a  penalty of 20Z. per ton.  TheCommonwealth Government, therefore, ask that the question may be reconsidered.   A.  Copx^er  Producers&apos;  Association, on  the  same  lines as the   Zinc Producers&apos;Association,  has  been formed  by the  Federal  Government, with  the  object  of controlling  the shipping,  selling  and  output  of Australian  copper.   The  annualproduction of this metal in the Commonwealth is estimated to be worth 5,000,000L   As the result of the Victorian State Elections, the Government have been defeatedand  Sir A. Peacock has resigned his position as Premier  of the State.
   With reference to the  withdrawal of  steamers  from New Zealand  trade, theDominion Ministers have informed the  British Government that it is  estimated&apos;thatat the end of November there  will have accumulated in New Zealand 2,200,000 lbs.of carcasses, 30,000 tons of wool, and 40,000 tons of cargo of second priority.                               SOUTH  AFRICA.   The taxation  proposals  have been again  before  the Provincial  Council of the transvaal and have been rejected  by 22 votes to 20.  This involves the defeat of theproposal to impose an income tax equivalent to, 10 per cent of the Union Income tax and  an excess profits  duty equivalent to  20 per cent,  of the  Union duty, &amp;c. (vide report  No. 42).    The Administrator  states that the  Witwatersrand Avordd  have contributed seven-eighths of the yield of the proposed Income Tax.                       PORTUGUESE  EAST AFRICA.   ddie British representative at Lisbon, having  conveyed to the Portuguese Ministerfor  Foreign Affairs the views of  the  British Government regarding the  matter  of recruiting for carriers (vide  Report No. 42) in  East  Africa, a reply has been received that  the Portuguese  Government are awaiting reports from Mozarnbicpue.   ddiePortuguese Minister, however, assured the British representative that  he  would senddefinite instructions ;  but the view  is expressed  by  the  latter that the  CentralCiovernment have little control over the Colonial Administration.PART  II. -FOREIGN AFFAIRS.                              ALLIED  AFFAIRS.    ddie new French  Prime Minister has informed Lord Bertie that a postponement of the meeting of the Paris War Conference until  29th November will be convenient to him, but on  the same  day&apos; the French Embassy  in  London announced that  themeeting would be on 22nd  November.    A Conference on the supply of munitions  to Italy has been held in Paris between mr. Churchill, AI. Loucheur, and General Dall&apos; Olio, and in reporting the  details to thePrime Minister Mr.  Churchill represents the  Italian demands as being on the wholemoderate, and considers that they can  be  met generally  without serious detriment tothe. munition programmes of the United. Kingdom or France.    ddie Foreign  Office learns that the American  negotiators will  probably have toleave London before  the arrival  of  the  Swedish  and  Dutch representatives, with whom, however,  the Ministry of Blockade is anxious to confer.    Numerous, references in the French Press, and an  article in M. Clemenceatds ownpaper, now reappearing as  Uhomme Libre, support the  contention  that  the logicalconsequence of the formation of the Supreme  Council is the appointment of a french commander-in-Chief of all the Allied Forces.    Lord Granville suggests that  the co-operation of Italy should be secured for  theestablishment of an inter-allied control of the  passenger traffic across  the italian frontier from Switzerland as a means of checking Constantiiiist  communication with greece and other enemy activities.                              /    The Foreign  Office has  circularized, the British  Representatives in Spain, central and South America, China, Siam  and Morocco on the importance of  the developmentof measures threatening the economic recovery of Germany after the war as a meansof hastening the conclusion  of  a satisfactory peace.  It is  pointed out  that Alliedfirms and subjects abroad  should  take the fullest advantage of  war conditions,  andthe effect of the Statutory List to destroy or capture German trade in those countries,.and prevent the  accumulation of supplies for  post-war shipment to Germany.                                   FRANCE.    Lord Bertie reports that the President of  the Republic, after consulting numerousstatesmen, had  recourse to M. Rene Renoult, the Leader of the Radical Socialists,*
who was invited to form a Ministry.  In view of the fact that on 15th November theSocialist parliamentary group, in conjunction wdth the Administrative Commissionand. members of the Confederation.  Generale du Travail, had decided to confirm, thedecision of 10th November to abstain from any campaign in the lobbies which wouldbe likely to favour the advent  to power of a Ministry which would be a defiance tothe working classes and  to enter into  immediate  contact  wdth  the  RepublicanSocialists and Radical  Socialists, it was at  (me time possible that  an Administrationof the  Left, would  be  formed.  M.  Renoult, however, declined office, and  a mutualfriend  brought about  a reconciliation between  the President  of  the Republic andM.  Clemenceau.   President  Poincare even  waived his  personal  objections to theadministrative  employment of his rival for  the Presidency, M. Pains.    In consequence  of these reconciliations M. Clemenceau.  on  15th Novemberaccepted the task of forming  an Administration and  took  office  next day.    The Socialists who  remember the iron-handed methods of M. Clemehceau  in pastlabour troubles are uneasy at his return to  power, and  Lord Bertie is informed that,immediately upon his assumption  of office acts of sabotage  began  in  munition factories and electric-light works.   The Prime Minister  thereupon sent word to  the leader  of  the  Confederation Generale  du  Travail,  who  had on 10th  Novemberadvocated the  use of  force against any Government  likely  to be a danger  to  theworking classes (vide Report  No.  12, page 9), that if the  sabotage continued troops would, be brought  to Paris and the leaders of the movement held responsible.  Thesabotage  ceased.   In  connection  with, this it  is interesting to observe that  Sir  11.Rumbohhs  report to  the  effect that Germany  counts  on  the increase of intriguesagainst President Poincare, and hopes that  the  influence of M. Caillaux  wdll  bringabout further Ministerial crises which will  shortly lead to the restoration of M. LeonBourgeois to power.   Under  him, whom the Germans  consider to be  a violentAnglophobe, they  expect France and Russia to make a  separate peace.    ddie following is a  complete list of. the new Cabinet, wdth the Under Secretaries as announced on 18th November : President of the Council and.

       Lord Bertie reports that the French War Committee, of which the President of the    Republic is Chairman, in consequence of the change of Ministry, now consists of the    Prime Minister (Minister for War) and MM. Pichon (Foreign Affairs), Georges Leygues    (Marine), Klotz (Finance), Jonnart (Blockade), Boret (Agriculture  and Supplies), and.    Loucheur (Munitions).       M. Clemenceau, after eight years&apos; absence  from the Chamber, on  20th November    made a statement of policy in which  he appealed  to the Chamber to &quot; set the seal of    its determination &quot; upon the prosecution  of the war nothing but war.  He offered    justice to traitors, as administered  by Courts-martial, and hoped thereby  to crush    pacifist   campaigns,  treason   and  half-treason.   The  Prime  Minister  predicted    restrictions upon  food, but removed, the censorship  on  political  discussions, under    which he has himself suffered.  The declaration was enthusiastically received by the    Chamber which voted confidence in the new Administration by 418 to 65, a majority    of 353, which  may be compared to the first majority accorded to the  reconstituted    Painleve Cabinet on 25th October, which was only 151.  The British Ambassador learns    that the  minority consisted of 63  Socialists, 1 Radical Socialist, and  1  Independent,    and. that 25 Socialists were among the 40 abstentions.        In  a despatch dated  6th November,  Lord Bertie reports that  public opinion    considered  the failure  of  the official prosecution,  of  L&apos; Action Fvancaise  to  be the    death blow of the Painleve Administration,  which, was then considered, although only    a  fortnight old, to be moribund,  chiefly on account of the  general impression  ofV  indecision  and  weakness which its eponymous hero had created from the moment he    had become Prime Minister.   The prcnongatToiFbl  its  existence until  13th  November    was due to the absence  of M. Painleve in Italy.       . Senator PlumberPs parliamentary immunities, which have  already been  suspended    in  order to admit  of  a prosecution by  Bolo, were,  on 16th  November, further    suspended in  order to permit  M. Gustave Tery, editor  of L&apos;0euvre, to bring  an action    against  the Senator, who in return proposes  to  bring  an action for  libel against    M. Tery.        Lord Bertie reports that, proceedings have been ordered against  Captain Mathieu    for communicating to M. Paix-Seailfes official documents subsequently found in the    possession  of  Almereyda.  Captain Mathieu  was the Chief of the French Secret    Service under the command of General Sarrail.                                    ITALY.   Sir R. Rodd refers  to  the  unwillingness  on the part of many members  of  theItalian Government to take vigorous action against enemy agents and  propaganda in italy, and suggests  that the presence  of British troops in Venetia now gives GreatBritain  the right to insist on the immediate  expulsion or internment  of all  enemy subjects, and  drastic action against anti-Ally  propaganda.  Meanwhile, the Ministerof the Treasury, Signor Nitti, has succeeded in reviving an old decree permitting thetransport of foreigners from one province to  another,  and is lodging enemy subjectsunder supervision in South Italian monasteries.   Accordingly on  20th  November Mr. Lloyd George sent a personal message to signor Orlando announcing  that the British  Government was very anxious that allenemy subjects and suspect persons in the sphere where  the Allied troops either passor remain should be immediately expelled or  interned, as their activities imperil thewhole Allied cause.    Sir  1L Rumbold learns  that  the German objective  in  the  Italian campaign isGenoa,  in which town as being Anglophobe, an Italian revolution  can  most easily be started.    Sir  P. Rodd, in a despatch dated 5th November, writes that since assuming office the Prime Minister, Signor Orlando, has taken things very much into  his own hands,and has  issued,  a number of messages  of an &quot;important  character without  consultinghis  principal  colleagues.  It would seem  evident, moreover, that the influence ofBaron Sonnino in the present Administration  will be less great than&apos; it was in the  last. The Ambassador does  not think that the Minister for Foreign Affairs has much in-common with the clever and ambitious Signor Nitti, Minister for the Treasury.    Sir   R.  Rodd  learns  that  the  Prime  Minister,  who  returned   to  Rome  on 19th November,  was  well satisfied with what he saw of the condition  of  affairs
in Venetia.   Signor Nitti considers that this attempted Bomfahrt on the part of theEmperor  has united Italy to a hitherto unequalled degree, and that the national spiritof resistance is now very determined.                                    SERBIA.   ddie French Government, on 15th November, was opposed to the administration, ofPodgradetz by the Serbians (vide Reports No. 41, page 8, and No. 42, page 10) on theground, that as the present state of Albania precludes the re-establishment  of a civil administration General Sarrail has been ordered  to leave under military control any territory reoccupied. in that country.                                   GREECE.   ddie British  Government  is  supporting the representations of  Greece  for  the suppression of the Italian  Post Office  at  Corfu, and Lord  Granville refers to  thedesirability  of inviting the Greek Government to co-operate in the work  of  the localInter-Allied Passport  Control, on  which  Great Britain and France  are at  presentrepresented.   The Foreign Office has invited  Lord Granville to arrange for the  Greek Press to publish the facts concerning the general international food shortage and  the  scarcity of tonnage  by way of explanation of the present situation in Greece  which is being exploited  by  enemy  agents.   Mention  is  also to be made of those  grain  cargoes,allotted to and needed, by other Allies, which have been diverted  to Greece.   ddie British  Consul,  at Corfu reports  the approaching cessation of the Frenchsupply  of flour  to the British community in that island, without which,  the  position will be serious as there is now  no flour  in the place ; meanwhile, Lord Granville hasinvited the Greek Government to supply the necessary flour.   Lord Granvilie reports the extension of Martial Law to the  nome of Ivozhani inGreek Macedonia, as from 16th November  (N.S.).                          ENEMY ALLIED AFFAIRS.   Sir II. Rumbold learns that  in  Austrian Court circles the offensive against Italy is  considered  to lie  the  last  card  of  the Central Powers.  From  the same sourceit  appears that the  Emperor  Charles  has  informed the Pope  that  his presence  onthe Italian front was meant to  safeguard Italian towns from destruction by the invadingarmies.   Sir E. Howard is informed, on the  indirect authority of  Count Czernin that at the berlin Crown Council on 5th November Herr  von Kuhlinann  proposed  that  theCrown of Poland should be offered  to the Emperor Charles.  Owing, however, to theopposition of the Prussian Governor-General of Poland, von Beseler, no decision wasreached  on the subject, and  it is  now considered likely that the settlement of  thePolish cptestion wdll be left in  abeyance until the end of the  war.   Sir E. Howard reports a further conversation wdth  Prince Lubecki, in which  the prince hinted that a Polish  Army, if formed, would be used,  to  repel any furtherinvasion of Poland, and even resist  any possible future advance of the Russians.   HeconsiderecLhowever, that if German)&apos;&apos;  were to annex Lithuania, German influence in poland would be greatly shaken, and. that it  might be possible  to avoid the creationof a separate Polish Army if the  Allies  were then to issue a joint  declaration infavour of.  an  independent Poland  containing the Polish districts of Lithuania and white Russia.   Sir E. Howard learns  from a Swedish diplomatic source in Vienna that Austrianopinion is far from jubilant over the recent successes in Italy.   All classes in Austriadesire peace,  and it is  felt  that the Austro-German. victories will  only benefit  theGermans, who will increase their claims, and  thus  postpone peace.  From anothersource  the British Minister in. Stockholm learns that the Emperor Charles was strongly opposed to the  Venetian  offensive,  and actually succeeded in postponing it for three weeks.     4297-4                             c
                              GERMAN  AFFAIRS.   Sir \V. Townley reports  that Herr von Dancll, Count von Heidli.hg*s successor  as prime Minister of Bavaria, announced his programme of policy on  13til November  in&quot;the Lower House in Munich.   He hopes to  improve  the condition of the  workingclasses and to assure their  position, to reorganise, cheapen  and  simplify the processof government, and proposes to devote special attention to social-political questions.   ddie German wireless of 21st November announces the resignation of Dr. Schwander,Secretary of  State for Imperial Economy, and the appointment  of Baron von Stein,Under Secretary of State for Alsace-Lorraine, as his successor.   Sir M. Findlay is advised that the Norwegian Government has  secret  information tothe effect that Germany cannot hold out much longer as the output  of workmen even in munition factories-us now reduced by 50 per cent, owing to  under-nourishment.  Asa result of this, the shortage of labour is emphasised.   The Germans realise that they cannot hold out till next harvest.on a  ration of250 grammes of flour a day.  They do not wish to reduce the ration, as they did lastyear,  because this led to a great deal of popular disorder,  ddiey therefore orderedthat  10 pier cent, of the ration  should consist of potato flour.   Having done  this,they  next ordered that  the flour ration  should  be given  in the  form  of  potatoes.Thus  the  ration of 250  grammes has already been, silently reduced by 25 grammes,and it is exjiected that there will soon be further reduction.                             AUSTRIAN  AFFAIRS.   Sir ,H. Rumbold;. sends; certain details as to the value of the Hungarian crops tothe enemy Empires as having been received from a  good source.  During the threeyears immediately preceding the war, the average annual yield of the Hungarian cropwas 141. million quintals.  In 1916  this yield was ox\]y 61 million quintals ; in 3.917the estimated  yield has further  sunk to 52 million quintals.   Of this  crop,  in  theyears just before  the war, Hungary exported  annually nearly 40 million quintals toGermany and  Austria.  In 1916  she exported 6 millions ; this  year she will not beable  to afford anything.                            BULGAR1AN AFFAIRS.   Sir H. Rumbold, in a despatch dated 2nd November, communicates information tothe effect that the  Emperor WillianFs recent visit  to  Sofia had  left a disagreeableimpression on the Bulgarians.  Ide told them  that they could not expect to receiveNish, nor all the country up to the Morava, nor as much territory in the Dobruja  asthey had hoped.   They might, perhaps, be given  a small enclave to the north of the danube opposite Rustchuk.   In view of this the Bulgarians are less eager to embark upon a new offensive, as they are now uncertain  whether any political benefits are to lie reaped from further military success,  ddie Intelligence  Bureau, however, considersthat this information is untrustworthy, and that the impression referred to may havebeen produced by other causes, and points  out that  the Bulgarian Press takes  it for granted  that the Emperor WillianFs visit implied a reassurance  to Bulgaria that herwar aims were approved by Germany.   In any case it appears that all inhabitants ofthe Dobruja held prisoner in the Central Empires have  been released by the EmperorWilliam on the petition  of the Bulgarian Committees interested in that province, andthis is taken to imply recognition of the Bulgarian claim  to retain  the whole of theDobruja up to the mouth of the Danube.                               NETHERLANDS.   Sir W. d^ownley reports that the refusal of the Dutch Government to permit theexport of horses to Germany  as  provided for in the already initialled, lint as yetunsigned, Agreement has  caused  the Germans to declare that  the  Agreement has
been broken.  The action of the Dutch, which is due to the objections of the Ministerof Finance  to the  export  of horses, has caused irritation, and  the  British Ministerlearns that  all exports  of  foodstuffs to Germany was stopped, without warning, on1.1th November, a condition which still prevailed four days later,  ddie reasons  givenfor this are the  failure  of Germany to export  the stipulated steel, and  the dutch government is reported  to have informed  the Germans that the  prohibition was  dueto the  intervention of  the  United.  States.   Sir  YV. Townley, however, understandsthat it is the noil-delivery of horses which  has really caused,  the trouble.   According to  Press  reports referred  to by  the British Minister, a number ofbarges loaded with sand  and gravel from Germany were  turned back at the  dutch frontier on  15th November, as  185,000  tons had already been  passed through since.1.5th October.   It appears that there  is a leakage of commercial.cables from the Dutch East Indiesinto Holland in spite of the suspension of facilities.   The Intelligence Bureau circulates a  report  drawing attention to the insecurity ofthe Dutch tenure of the  Dutch East Indies and to the native agitation for the  estab-lishment of Japanese  domination in lieu  of Dutch, an agitation which appears to bewell supported by a propaganda directed from  Tokyo of such activity as  to support jthe view that  a change in the  ownership of the islands will take  place at no distant date.                                                          1/4., K  k,:&quot;   ,   .....,    K                                SWITZERLAND.   Sir 11.  Ruinboid, in  a  despatch  dated 5th  November, reports  that  the enemyvictories in  Italy have  made a considerable impression, in  Switzerland, and certainGerman-Swiss newspapers have hinted that  the Swiss Government can now afford totake a firmer  line in economic negotiations -with  the Allies,  ddie Minister considersthat much, as  the Swiss respect the military prowess of the Germans,  upon whom theyare dependent for coal, they still realise that their food supply is at the mercy  of theAllies, and  in consequence fear the United States  even more than Germany. , Possiblythis economic factor exercises restraint, as not even  in pro-German organs is military co-operation-operation with the Central Empires advocated, and Sir 11. Rumbold. remains of theopinion  that nothing short of the violation of Swiss, territory by a belligerent  power will cause Switzerland to  depart from  her neutrality.  He points out, however,  thatin the event of such violation being  perpetrated  by Germany, General Wide, who isin command of the Swiss Army, and absolutely pro-German,  might, by effecting  afaulty distribution  of  troops, or  by delaying further mobilisation for a few hours, socompromise the Swiss plans prepared against such  an emergency as to impair greatlythe value of the Swiss Army for purposes of  resistance.  The Swiss Chief of Staff ison the other hand a man of rigid integrity.    Owing to  the general  uneasiness caused by  the autocratic attitude adopted bythe military authorities,  whose position,  during  mobilisation appears to be  partiallyextra-legal  and. has so far received  no legislative  or judicial interpretation,  a  desirehas arisen for a reorganisation of the Swiss military system.   According to the british minister this  desire has greatly influenced the recent elections, and has producedSocialist successes in many large towns.   One of the grievances  exploited successfullyfor electioneering purposes is that Swiss troops  are  employed in  the performance of  apinchbeck mimicry of Prussian manoeuvres while their services were urgently requiredin preventing smugglers from conveying good  Swiss food over the frontiers  into germany and Austria.    Sir C.  Spring  Rice  advises the  Foreign Office  that the War Trade  Board  has instructed Mr. MacCormick to  begin negotiations  wdth Switzerland de novo  in Paris.    In a report on Switzerland circulated by the Intelligence Bureau, it is  pointed outthat  the economic policy of the Allies  towards  that country is purely negative, asSwitzerland is regarded  as a door into Germany, which must be sealed up no  matterhow much economic harm may be done to the neutral in the process of harming, even to an infinitesimal  degree, the enemy beyond.    The danger of a ruthless economicblockade against  Switzerland,  if continued  after the  war as  part of  a  systemof economic  offensive  or  reprisal  against Germany nmy drive the  Confederationeconomically, and. in  the  end even politically, into the arms of  Germany,   ft  issuggested that a positive policy towards Switzerland on the part  of the Allies whichwould enable her to dispense with Germany and establish her economic independence
in collaboration with them, the Allies would,  impose a far more  effective  barrier on-Germany than they can at present by means of an indiscriminate blockade of the confederation.   Sir Id. Rumbold  draws attention to the riots at Zurich on 17th and 18th November,promoted  by a  number  of  native  and  foreign  deserters, shirkers,  conscientious objectors, and Pacifists, who took exception to  the regulations recently promulgated bythe  Federal Council as to the  future treatment of foreign deserters  and absenteesfrom military service.                                    NORWAY.    A. meeting of the three Sbandinavian Kings has been arranged for 2Sth november in Christiania.   The  visiting  monarchs  will be  attended  by their respective PrimeMinisters and Ministers for Foreign Affairs, and Sir M. Findlay fears that the King of sweden will bring his German Queen.  The  meeting, which is  unfortunate  from thepoint of view of the Allies and not particularly welcome to the King of Norway, whowill, find difficulty in  entertaining  his  guests owing to  food  shortage  and  publicdistress, appears to  have been planned  by  the Swedish  and German Ministers  inChristiania in order to hamper the negotiations which might be in progress betweenNorway  and the  Allies  if only the United  States  Minister had been  given any instructions.  Sir M. Findlay  suggests that this meeting will  be inconvenient to theAllies as it may lead to  a tightening of the Scandinavian entente, to joint Scandinavianpeace proposals, to proposals for  the occupation of Sweden of the Aaland Islands, orof Finland, to  a Scandinavian Alliance  against United States pressure, and  to  bindNorway  to resist any demand for naval  facilities on the part  of the Allies.  TheBritish   Minister draws  attention  to the continued failure of the  United StatesGovernment to instruct its Minister in  Christiania, and remarks  that the delay hasalready caused  many  good opportunities to be lost.    Sir AI.  Findlay  learns that  the  position  of the Norwegian  Cabinet has  been strengthened by the  announcement of the Royal visits, though perhaps the Ministerfor Provisioning may be sacrificed.  Attacks  upon the Ministry in Parliament enabledpart of  the Socialist Party to declare in favour of a Coalition Government,  but none ofthe critics were able to suggest that  even the closest union  between the Parties in norway or the  Kingdoms in Scandinavia would be able to alleviate the food shortageto any appreciable degree.    Sir AI. Findlay reports an  offer on the  part of Austria of 10,000 tons  of sugar to norway in return for a loan amounting to four or five times the  value of the sugar,Ide learns,  however, that the  Director of the Food Commission has refused  the  offer for the  time  being  as he considers it  impolitic  to accept  such  an  offer  whilenegotiating with the United States, particularly as he does not believe the Austrianscan deliver  the sugar,  and   are merely bluffing  in the hopes of  confusing theNorwegian negotiations.                                   SWEDEN.   Great  interest is displayed in the forthcoming Royal visit to Christiania, which, asit,  has  been  arranged apparently  on.  the initiative  of King Gustavus  V., who,when last  in-  that  city,  was  Regent  of   Norway,  is  taken  as indicating  theend  of  the sore  feeling which has  existed  between  Norway and Sweden  sincethe  disruption  of the  Union in 1905.   It is also hoped that it may lead to somesettlement of the question of Finland, which is now exercising the public  mind.  SirE. Howard reports that the occupation of Finland by Sweden, with the consent of theAllies, during the war in order to maintain a neutral, status in  that  country is  beingpublicly advocated, and that suggestions have been made that the occupation might lead subsequently to a personal union between Sweden and Finland.  In any case theMinister considers that Swedish opinion is strongly  opposed  to  the  acquisition off inland by Germany,  and the French Minister in Stockholm fears  that perhapsSweden may enter the  war on the side of Germany, possibly with a view to obtaining the Grand Duchy in return for her services.
                                    DENMARK.   ddie Minister for Foreign Affairs who will attend King Christian X. to Christiania,has informed. Sir R. Paget, that he considers it unlikely that any attempt will be madethere to arrive at a joint Scandinavian economic policy.   Ho hoped, that the meeting would be  interpreted  as emphasizing the intention of the three, kingdoms to remainneutral, as if Norway  were to enter  the  war, Denmark would  immediately he  drawn in.   Sir R. Paget learns  from, another  source that the German military  authoritiescontemplate the occupation of Denmark in the event of an abandonment of neutralityon  the part,  of  Norway.   From  the  same source it appears that the Germans arenow putting pressure, on  the Danish Government to secure the total prohibition of all exports from Denmark to  the United Kingdom and their diversion to Germany.   Sir C.  Spring Pice animadverts upon the distressingly faulty methods of negotiationadopted by the War Trade Board in its  dealings with neutrals on economic questions,and  reports that it is anxious to refer the Danish negotiations to the President,  ddieAmbassador  points out that, owing  to the American  need for tonnage,  there  is a danger that United  States  negotiators  may abandon  blockade considerations andconclude  agreements with Denmark on  the basis of tonnage alone.                                     SPAIN.   The Foreign Office  on 16th November advised Sir A.  Hardinge that complete agreement had nearly been reached, on all  outstanding points under negotiation withthe  Spanish  Ambassador,  who has, however,  left  London before receiving  thenecessary authority to  sign  the  Agreement,&apos; as it stands.   Sir A. Hardinge, however,is of opinion that the new Ministry in Spain is not  dealing honestly, being timid, andafraid of large expenditure by Germans at  the next general  election.   One Minister,moreover, who has hitherto been friendly to the Allies, has now been  bought  by theGermans and has openly declared  in  the Cabinet that  he  is  opposed to commercial negotiations wdth  us.   Another Minister, probably similarly influenced,  has  assertedthat the  new  Ministry  will &quot;entirely reverse the  foreign policy of its predecessor, astatement which directly contradicts the  pronouncement made  by the Marquis ofAlhucemas himself  on 3rd November  to  the Italian  Ambassador on  that  subject(vide Report No. 41, page 13).  Yet a third Minister is the legal adviser of the well-known German firm of  Mannesman!! Brothers.   ddie Foreign Office has declined the conditional offer of  Spanish olive oil for the woollen, industry in  this country and has, instead,  accepted  a larger  and apparentlymore advantageous tender from ddtnis.                                  PORTUGAL.   : The  Portuguese  Government has offered every facility to  the  British officersdetailed to  make preliminary investigations connected  with the installation  of a wireless telegraphy station  in  the Azores and  has  consented  in advance  to  the     -4297-4                               D   In view of the possibility of this eventuality, the French Minister has communicatedto his Government proposals for governing the negotiations with the Swedish mission in London on the subject of the future Allied supplies for Sweden which Sir E. Howardtransmits to the Foreign Office with criticisms and appreciations.   ddie presence of the  Swedish Mission in London will involve a great deal of cablecommunication  wdth  the  Government in Stockholm,  and the  question  of ciphertelegrams has again arisen in a somewhat acute form.  Mr. liellner has withdrawnfrom  the position announced last  week  (vide Report  Mo. 4-2, page.  14), and  nowdeclines to make use of  the limited  facilities offered in this direction,  by the BritishGovernment,  in view  of  this  Sir E. Howard suggests  that  perhaps  full facilitiesmight be accorded to the Mission, as separate from the Legation in London.   Sir E. Howard leans that Mr..Braiitiug&apos;s health is so poor that he wished to resignfrom the Cabinet.   Ho was overruled, but  has been given long  leave, during whichthe Socialist Baron Paimstierna will take charge of the Ministry of Finance, while thePrime Minister will take over the Admiralty.
immediate execution of the  necessary  works, reserving the  right to purchase  ordismantle the station at the  end of the war.   Sir L. Carnegie has  accordingly been directed to express the  thanks and satisfaction, of the British Government.                                    J.A.PAN.   In view  of the constant  nature of the British policy towards  the  independence and  territorial integrity of China&apos; which  is  embodied  in the Anglo-Japanese Agree-ment of 13th July. 1911, the British Government  does  not intend  to exchange Noteswith, the Japanese Government  on the subject or notify the adhesion of Great britain to those already exchanged between the United States and Japan, and Sir C. Spyingllice has been instructed to advise tile State Department of this decision.  - In a despatch  to Sir  C.  Greene, Mr.  Balfour communicates the substance of a conversation with the Japanese Ambassador from which it  appears that the chances of obtaining  additional military and naval aid from  Japan are small.   The reasonsfor  this may  be found in  the memorandum on these  subjects  by  Lieutenant-ColonelSonierville, British Military Attache in Tokyo, in which he writes    &quot;.   .  .    .  The Japanese  Army is but little advanced  in the military art  since      the war with  Russia, and is utterly unfit to take the field against  the Germans      without inonths cf  special training..  Of all the scientific appliances of modern      warfare they  are ignorant of the use.   Aeronautics  are still in  their infancy      and seem unlikely  to advance till foreign embargoes on exports are &quot;withdrawn ;      and the armament  of every branch of the service  is below, and  in many cases      very far below, the requirements of modern, warfare.   Of these defects the staff      is acutely conscious.  But there is, 1 am convinced, also  the feeling that they      cannot  be certain how far the moral of the men can be relied on  if  exposed to      the tests of  the lighting  in Europe, and more  particularly to the long drawn-      out trench warfare.&quot;   &quot; ....   I have often  heard  it said, and it may be, that the staff here  believe      that the moral of the Japanese soldier is not capable  of  sustaining this ordeal.      If so, their  reluctance!  to expose him to it is easily comprehensible.  Should he      fail, under  it, the  bubble reputation  produced  by  the  Russo-Japanese War      would be effectually pricked, and his military value  would  sink  to that  of.the      other Oriental fighting races.&quot;   &quot;.   .  .  .   I believe that the sole circumstance that would firing Japan quickly      and enthusiastically into the field, would be the conclusion, of a separate peace      by Russia, and that a clean  sweep would shortly be made  of everything east      of Lake Baikal.&quot; -                                     CHINA.   The granting of the Arms contract to J apian, (vide Reports. No. 38, page 15, andNo. 39, page 13), appears to have caused the Peking Government to lose the goodwdllof many  of its  former supporters.   Sir  J.  Jordan  telegraphs  that  the NorthernMilitary  Governors  in. Kiangsu,  Kiangsi,  and  JJupei  have  protested  against  theaction  of  the Government, that the mercantile interests in the Yangtze Valley havedenounced the Government  for borrowing foreign  money in  order to finance a civil war, and that the Northern Generals in Hunan have arranged a cessation of hostilitiesand  demanded a peaceful settlement with the South.  On this the Ministry resigned(16th November), but owing apparently to Japanese  intervention, resumed, office next day. As, however, the Northern, troops have had to evacuate Changsha, and the Militaryand Civil Authorities of Hunan have  fled to  Ihmkovv on  board a Japanese gunboat,it is  difficult to see  how  Northern  authority  is  to be  reimposed in  face  of  theopposition of the Governors of the Yangtze provinces.   This at one time appeared  to favour the policy of the  President, who, unlike his prime  Minister,  wishes to . arrange  peace &apos; with the  South by negotiation, but  SirJ. Jordan considers  that both  President and Premier are now estranged from their supporters and that the Government in Peking no longer enjoys the confidence of  the
country.   In these circumstances the Press  report, circulated on 21st November, thatthe Ministry has again resigned, is not unexpected.    A. Southern transport, which entered  Hong Kong for repairs, has been  refusedcoal and supplies, but  by order  of the Foreign Office she was  instructed to leave  the harbour as her detention was considered impolitic.                                   URUGUAY.   Mr. Mitchell Innes learns that the Uruguayan Government has temporised in itsreply to the Argentine invitation to attend a Congress of Neutrals in Buenqs Aires, inspite of the pressure exercised by President Irigoyen to  secure a favourable answer tohis invitation.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs considers that the  sudden revival ofthis proposal on the part of the Argentine Government is due to Papal influence (vide report  No.  36,  page 13), and  states  that propagandists  have asserted that GreatBritain and the United States favour Argentine mediation.                                    BRAZIL.   The Minister of Marine has  intimated  to  Sii;  A.  Peel that  if a  favourable replywere assured, he would make official application for the  services of a British  NavalMission to train the Brazilian Navy,   ddie Brazilian Minister in London has already secured the services of four non-commissioned officers of the Royal Marine Artilleryfor that purpose, and  Sir A. Peel emphasises  the importance of  consenting to such aproposal in view of the great influence which foreign Instructors can exert in SouthAmerica in developing opinions favourable to their native country.   ddie Foreign Office advises Sir A. Peel that the question of the Arsenal concession in Brazil offered by President brazil (vide Report No. -11, page 15) is being  consideredby the armament firms affected.                                     CHILE.   Sir 0, Spring Rice is instructed to enquire into the scope and objects of  the Trustwdiich is  to be  formed  of  all producers  of nitrate in Chile, including GermanCompanies, as the Foreign Office is anxious to know how far the formation  of such a trust will enable the German and  Russian Companies in it to escape the effects of the refusal of the British and  United States Governments to permit any further shipmentsor deliveries of oil to them.                                   ECUADOR.   Mr. Wilson reports that a revolution, headed by Sefior Intriaga, has broken out  inthe provinces of Los Pros and  Manabi.  There is general dissatisfaction with thepolicy of President  Moreno, who endeavours to placate the Germans  by re-employingfour members of  the German Scholastic Mission, while  irritating them by his refusal to allow Dr. Perl, the former German Minister in Lima, to come to Ecuador.                                   PANAMA.   Sir C. Mallet advises the Foreign Office that the Government has protested againstthe censoring of official correspondence addressed, to the Minister for Foreign Affairs.                                    MEXICO.   Mr. Cummins is unable as yet to detect signs of the immediate downfall of GeneralCarranza, but considers that, incredible as it  may seem,  an attack upon the United    4297-4                             n
States  is  actually  contemplated.  Unfortunately the revolutionary factions, which.might  otherwise  have been  relied upon  to  destroy  Carranza are also inflamed withviolent hostility towards the United States which seems to blind them to the  dangerof the GeneraFs policy in leading to the possible extinction of Mexican,  independence.German  Agents  have approached General  Felix Diaz to secure the support of his party for the  German  movement which  is expected  to  culminate  in a carefullyengineered, rising on behalf of the enemies of the United States.  Meanwhile there arestrikes and  fighting in the Tampioo area, the  oil camps have  been deserted by thenative labourers,  and there is a chance that General Carranza may seize  the oilfieldsif no foreign objection be raised.    Sir C,Spring Rice warns the Foreign Office that the United States  Governmenthave a certain influence over the situation in Mexico as there is a great food, shortage in the country and the United States embargo  on exports will not be raised until the mexican Government assumes a very much more satisfactory attitude.                                     CUBA.   Mr.  Beech learns that the  Cuban Government  will  probably ultimately enactsimilar legislation to that in force in the United States for the restriction of trading with the enemy, but suggests  that the Allies should  urge immediate  action  in  thisdirection.  Failing this he fears undue procrastination.                               UNITED STATES.   Sir C. Spring Rice in a despatch  dated 25th October, referring  to  the growth ofdislike for German methods in the United States, writes :    &quot; It is gradually dawning on the Government and jjeople here that  the law of the       prize ring should bo applied to Germany, and if  she puts herself beyond the       pale  in  the war she  will  be  kept out of the pale after the war.   There is a       growing feeling with regard to trade  restrictions, trading with the enemy and       blacklisting, that what we did before the United  States entered into  the war       was right and  just.   This feeling will  grow and grow more  quickly  if we       refrain from saying &apos; 1 told you so.&apos;  We are careful to put the plain facts with       as few comments as possible before the persons responsible for  the administra-       tion.  of  the war  measures,   ddie  effect is evident and is  working,  but the       working is slow.  There is  still  a strong element who regard Avar as a new       form of  business  to  be conducted on the old  lines without much modification       and Avith the old objects, namely, to get  rich  at  the expense of a neighbour.       Such people readily suppose that these are the motives which are actuating us.       They are being undeceived.&quot;   The  Ambassador goes on to  describe the  change which has  come  over publicopinion  Avith  regard to the  war during the  last six months a  change which he considers &quot; almost fantastic.&quot;  There is still, however     &quot; a great  want of co-ordination between the civil  and the naval  and military       authorities,  ddie old jealousy of military domination inherent  in the race is       very Adsible  in  Washington,   ddie  naval authorities do not even control the       anchorages in the naval  ports.  The  military authorities have got no power  to       requisition without elaborate recourse to a complicated civil  procedure.   What       is most serious is that  there is no co-ordinating  power which, can determine       Avith authority how the resources of  the country can be best used, for a single       purpose.   There is no co-ordinating  authority here, nor has this country any       certain means of  becoming informed, not only of their own  Avar needs but the       Avar needs, of the Allies as a -whole.  The Avar is still conducted  by pigeon-holes       in departments.  There is no central direction except the President, and he is       a single man.&quot;    Sir C.  Spring Rice, in a despatch dated 19th October, reports that     &quot; ddie mission from the Labour  Department of the Ministry of  Munitions, headed       by Sir Stephen son  Kent, has  had a most signal  success during its stay here.
                            SHIPPING  SITUATION.   According to the War Trade  Intelligence  Report the total tonnage of  500 tonsgross in the case of steamers, and 100 tons gross  in the case of sailing ships reported lost owing to the malice of the King&apos;s enemies during the period 9th  November-to15th November inclusive  is 52,265  tons, of which 21,1-27 were British, as  comparedwith 39,800 tons of which 20,091-  were British  reported last week.   The existence of enemy submarine postal  service between Germany and Spain isreported from Paris,  ddie submarines are met by Spanish trawlers wdio receive  and.transmit the mails via Huelva from and to a German Agent in Barcelona.   ddie Germans dispute the British statement that only one  ship  of over 1,000 tons was sunk  by their submarines during the x^period. 4th November  to 11th, and claim.that  nine suchjships were in fact  sunk during  that period, of which five  were British.   Sir A.  Peel reports that the French have secured the use of  30 ex-enemy shix)from Brazil for one year for apxnoximatePy 5,000,OOOL   Two Italian representatives have been sent to London to take part in the discussions of the tonnage question which are in progress.   Sir E. Howard learns that  seven Russian  ships may now be released for removal from the Baltic, as well as three small British  ships.   Sir 11; Paget reports the opinion  of Mr. Damm that  if the International Seafarers&apos;Conference be  not held before  the  end  of this  year the International dTansxoortWorkers&apos;  Federation in Berlin will be able to  summon the Conference, and by holdingit at Stockholm will be able to nullify what has already been done in the direction of excluding the Central Powrers.  Mr.  Datum is  anxious that facilities  should be givento enable  a deputation of Danes to communicate in person wdth Mr. Havelock Wilsonon this subject.                            PEACE  DISCUSSIONS.   The International Peace Conference at Berne has been postponed until the end ofDecember, and the promoters have axiproached  the Foreign Office directly in hoxiesof securing  the issue of passports to British  subjects,  as  it  has now been arranged that the belligerent groups will be kexit separate (vide Report No. 42, page 20).  TheForeign Office has asked what line the French Government intends to take, expressingat the same  time its own unwillingness to grant passports.   The invitation of the Archbishoji  of Upsala (vide  Rexoort No.  42,  piage 21), islooked wpon in all Allied quarters as most  undesirable,  as the Prelate  has a sonserving in the German Army, and is notoriously and fanatically pro-German.   The head of the Bolshevist Committee in Stockholm,  M. Radek, an Austrian Jew,concerning  whom  Sir  E. Howard  forwards some  discreditable  details,  has beenbullying the Russian Legation there in order to obtain diplomatic facilities for hisown correspondence wdth Petrograd.  Sir E. Howard  reports that this leader projiosesimmediately to  convoke a Socialist Peace Conference  in  Stockholm,  although  hepersonally does not favour an immediate peace with  Germany, fearing that it might.leave the  autocracy in that country in power.   He is  anxious to  promote revolutionsin all European countries as a necessaiy preliminary  to a general Bolshevist x^eace,but  considers that Bolshevism in  Russia is  doomed  unless a revolution breaks out inGermany very shortly.    Sir H. Rumbold reports that  a Bolshevist delegate  has been in negotiation with the  German Minister to Switzerland at Geneva.    Sir E. Howard is informed that Dr. Helxihant, a  Jew, now passing under the nameof Parvus, born a Russian, naturalised an Ottoman,  and now an Austrian subject andSir Stephenson aud his colleagues have carefully refrained from giving anyunsolicited advice, but have put ail their available  information at the disposalof the United States authorities whenever it  was asked  for, with excellent results.  I hear that they have impressed both officials and  employers with thethoroughness of  British war organisation and the extent of  the sacrifices madeby all classes in England in the interests of industrial efficiency.&quot;
intimate with&apos;  the German Majority Socialists, met  M. Raclek  on 15th November in stockholm, with the result that M. Radek left that  night for Petrograd.  The british minister considers  it  likely  that these  two  gentlemen  were charged with  peacenegotiations  between  Germany and  the  Bolshevists.   Meanwdiile, according to the wireless Press, the All-Russian Congress of  Workmen&apos;s and  Soldiers&apos; Delegates hasempowered M. Lenin and the Council of  Peoples&apos; Commissaries to offer an  armisticeon the German front for the purpose of opening peace pourparlers.                                   GENERAL.   A conference has been arranged for 26th November at Berne on the subject of  an,exchange of civilian and invalid, combatant  prisoners  of war between  the UnitedKingdom and  Turkey.  The Swiss  Minister for Foreign Affairs will preside,  and.Lord Newton and General Belfiekl  have been appointed  British Delegates.  In viewof this Mr. WauglFs negotiations with  Rahmi Bey on the same  subject, while con-ducted on the lines originally laid down, will not include a written agreement.   According to the report of the Inspecting Dutch Medical Officer, the conditions ofthe prison camp at Fort Nine, near Ingolstadt, are most unsatisfactory, and the Foreign.Office has requested the  Netherlands  Minister in Berlin to arrange for the removal ofall British officers from this camp without delay.   Owing to the disturbances in Russia no&apos;funds are forthcoming for the maintenance in Holland of the Russian refugees from Germany, and  the Russian Legation in ddieHague has requested the British Government to guarantee the ultimate repayment of sums advanced by the Dutch Government on behalf of these Russians.   The attention of Sir M. Findlay is drawn to a German Press report that  Germancombatant prisoners of war in perfect health have been repatriated from Norway, andhe is instructed to inquire into the facts.   Sir W. Townley learns that  a wholesale  release of Austrian prisoners of war bythe Russians is considered likely.   Sir II. Rumbold reports that the Swiss Government i,s strongly against his demandfor an assurance that parcels sent to  Swiss  citizens in Belgium should not containcontraband as understood in the various Allied agreements with Switzerland, and hashinted that all exports to prisoners may be prohibited if Switzerland be not permitted to help her own nationals.
