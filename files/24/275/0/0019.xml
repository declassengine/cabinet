IN accordance with the Conclusions of the Cabinet at its meeting on the 2nd March, I circulate herewith a copy of a despatch to His Majesty&apos;s Ambas-ambassador in Paris, recording a conversation which I had with the French Ambassador on the 25th February, regarding the suggested approach to the German Government.H.March 3, 1938.Viscount Halifax to Sir E. Phipps (Paris).(No. 394.)Sir, Foreign Office, February 25, 1938.IN the course of my conversation with the French Ambassador to-day, his Excellency spoke of the grave doubt entertained by the French Government about our decision at this time to instruct our Ambassador in Berlin to seek an inter-view with Herr Hitler and, in particular, the French Government would have liked fuller information as to what might be the precise dimensions of any proposals for colonial cession that we might be willing to consider. Upon this I told him that -we had by no means moved so far or so fast. All that we had done, as you had been instructed to inform the French Foreign Minister, was to ask our Ambassador in Berlin when he saw Herr Hitler to take soundings as to what would be the German attitude towards proposals on the general lines that we had sketched to him. We had accompanied that by an assurance that if anything emerged from these enquiries it would not be our intention to propose any contribution from the French unless we ourselves were prepared to make a substantially equivalent contribution. We had proceeded no further than this in our Cabinet discussions of the matter, for the simple reason that we had thought it unprofitable to give any close examination to any more precise proposals until we knew what the German attitude towards the general proposition might be.2. M. Corbin appeared to be reassured by this, and I concluded by saying that&quot; the impression left on my mind by his conversation was that it might be of assistance if we were able to place him in possession in some more ordered form of our general thought on all these very important topics and in the approach that could best be made to them. I was hopeful that if we could do this his Government would find that there was less ground for the anxieties which it had been the particular purpose of his visit to convey to me. He said he would be grateful for this if it were possible, and wished me good-bye, once again reiterating how essential it was that we should exchange ideas together in the freest confidence.I am, &amp;c.HALIFAX.9733   [16776a]THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;8 GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  March 1938.
