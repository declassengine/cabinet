Printed for the Cabinet.   February 1938.:; v:SECRET. Copy No.CP. m (38).CABINET.AUSTRIA. Proposals of the French Government.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I CIRCULATE for the information of my colleagues the translation of a memorandum regarding the situation in Austria communicated by the French Ambassador on the 18th February (a typed version of which has already been circulated as CP. 44 (38)) together with the text of the reply which has been to-day communicated to the French Embassy in accordance with Conclusion 2 of the Cabinet held on the 23rd February.H.February 25, 1938.(Translation.)Memorandum left with the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs by the french ambassador on February 18, 1938.THE demarche made at Berlin by the British and French Ambassadors as a result of the arrangements which have just been reached at Berchtesgaden between the Governments of the Reich and of Austria, has not succeeded in producing sufficiently precise indications of the real scope of the Austro-German agreement. If in these circumstances England and France now remain silent, this attitude will not fail to be interpreted in Berlin as a tacit admission of resigned acquiescence on the part of the Western Powers. Not only would the German Government be justified in regarding this as a recognition of the accomplished fact, but also in believing that the Governments of London and Paris are prepared to let things go still further. This would be opening the way to new initiatives, doubtless of a still more serious nature.No illusions are possible about the consequences of the Berchtesgaden resolu-tions. Herr Hitler&apos;s remarks to the Austrian Chancellor and the language of the German press are equally significant of the state of mind of the Fuhrer and of those around him. Germany has possibly not succeeded at the first attempt in obtaining in Austria all she wanted, but we may rest assured that she will return to the charge. Will she wait until she has definitely settled the Austrian problem before tackling the Czechoslovak question 1 Nothing can yet be stated with certainty on this point, but there can be no doubt that her decisions will be prepared in the same secrecy and carried out with the same brutality as have marked the Berchtesgaden interview. Dr. Goebbels himself has, moreover, for a long time past publicly defended these methods.Great Britain and France, have already, on more than one occasion made an offer to the Government of the Reich to open far-reaching negotiations in which9731   [16768]
peace guarantees in Central Europe would have to be balanced by concessions to Germany in other spheres. The Berlin Government have always evaded these proposals. In fact their intention is, as is now proved to us, that they should settle themselves, by unilateral decisions, those questions which they regard as essential, and that conversations with London and Paris should not take place until after the final establishment of German hegemony in the centre of Europe, when Herr Hitler will consequently find himself in a position to speak in even more categorical terms than he is able to do to-day.The Western Powers should not deceive themselves as to the credit which they will retain in Central Europe and elsewhere if Germany&apos;s next ultimatums are accepted. If, on the contrary, they are rejected, and if the Czechoslovak Government show themselves determined to resist, all the consequences should be foreseen. The President of the Council and the Minister for Foreign Affairs of France had the opportunity during the Franco-British talks in November 1937 to recall what are France&apos;s engagements in this connexion. It is thus important, in the interests of European peace itself, whilst there is yet time, to stop the execution of the German plan by combined action on the part of Great Britain and France.The Austrian Chancellor has not resigned himself to capitulation, and Herr Hitler did not at Berchtesgaden reach all the objectives which he has set before himself. The situation therefore is not yet finally lost; but it is incontestable that Austria&apos;s resistance depends upon the support which she can find in London and Paris, Italy having abdicated her responsibility from the moment Signor Mussolini preferred to sacrifice the position of his country in Central Europe rather than renounce his Mediterranean ambitions.Herr Hitler has formally indicated to Dr. Schuschnigg that he counts upon the inaction of the Governments of London and Paris, and has gone so far as to claim contrary to the truth that his policy towards Austria and Czecho-slovakia received encouragement from Lord Halifax&apos;s remarks.Without ignoring the difficulties of the British Government in undertaking in advance any formal engagements, it is surely not impossible at last to open the eyes of Herr Hitler and his collaborators to the obligations which their anxiety to maintain peace in Central Europe may eventually impose upon Great Britain and France; it ought to be equally possible to undertake a concerted study between London and Paris of the most appropriate means for backing up the resistance of Vienna and Prague. In the opinion of the French Government, a very clear warning should be given to the German Government; in this respect it is questionable whether the last demarche made by the British Ambassador in Berlin was sufficiently of this character.The Austrian Chancellor had asked that a demarche, preferably joint, or at the least concerted, should be made in Berlin by the two Ambassadors. The French Government hold such a gesture to be essential in the near future, and they consider that the Government of the Reich should be warned : (1) That the legitimate anxiety of Dr. Schuschnigg to safeguard Austrian independence will not, in the opinion of Great Britain and France, allow him to go any further;(2) That the real and not merely verbal independence of Austria constitutes one of the major interests of European peace, and that the British and French Governments could not be indifferent spectators of any new attempts destined to destroy it;(3) That in general we cannot tolerate any coup de main or act of war likely to bring into question the territorial status quo in Central Europe, and that in that case these events would meet with opposition on the part of the Western Powers.Apart from such a warning, it would be equally desirable for the Govern-ments of London and Paris to consider whether all means of facilitating the rapprochement of the Danubian States have been exhausted; whether certain possibilities are not still open in this connexion in agreement with Vienna and Prague; and whether, in particular, these could not be found in the economic and financial sphere. 1 :    &apos;        &apos;     !However desirable Italian co-operation may still be, this is of a very&apos;uncertain character in view of the circumstances in Which Signor Mussolini has just abandoned Dr. Schuschnigg to his fate; it therefore remains very doubtful
whether the co-operation of the Duce can be obtained at present. However this may be, if such co-operation still remains possible, it would undoubtedly be easier to obtain it if Franco-British action did not appear to be subordinated to it. The more resolute we appear, the less; we shall seem to submit passively to events, and the greater will be the chances of bringing Italy back, to us some day.The French Ambassador would be glad to learn the views of the British Government on the foregoing considerations.Albert Gate House,February 18, 1938.Memorandum communicated to the Counsellor of the French Embassy onFebruary 25, 1938.THE French Embassy&apos;s memorandum of the 18th February, regarding recent events in Austria and the steps to be taken in order to mitigate the consequences likely to arise therefrom, has been carefully considered by His Majesty&apos;s Government.If the proposals put forward in that memorandum are understood aright, it is suggested (1) That a demarche, preferably joint or at least concerted, should be made in Berlin by the French and British Ambassadors to the following effect:  (a) That the legitimate anxiety of Dr. von Schuschnigg to safeguardAustrian independence will not, in the opinion of Great Britain and France, allow him to go any further;(b) That the real, and not merely verbal, independence of Austriaconstitutes one of the major interests of European peace, and that the British and French Governments could not be indifferent spectators of any new attempts destined to destroy it;(c) That, in general, neither the French nor British Governments cantolerate any cov/p de main or act of war likely to bring into question the territorial status quo in Central Europe, and that, in that case, these events would meet with opposition on the part of the Western Powers; and(2) That, apart from a warning in the above sense, it would be equally desirable that the Governments of London and Paris should consider whether all means of facilitating the rapprochement of the Danubian States have been exhausted; whether certain possibilities are not still open in this connexion in agreement with Vienna and Prague; and whether, in particular, these could not be found in the economic and financial spheres.His Majesty&apos;s Government have every sympathy with the preoccupations which have induced the French Government to put forward these suggestions, and they fully share the concern felt by the French Government at the possible future course of events in Austria and perhaps in other States of Central Europe. It is, however, when they come to consider the methods proposed by the French Government to counter these possibilities that His Majesty&apos;s Government begin to entertain certain doubts. They feel that mere words, unless supported by the will to follow them up with deeds, are unlikely to stem a process which they, with the French Government, would deplore, but which, in view of the measures already initiated in Austria as a result of the Berchtesgaden agreement, might easily be made to assume the appearance of a normal evolution. Any language of the nature suggested, if held in Berlin, might, if it became known in Vienna, only mislead the Austrian Chancellor by encouraging his hopes for military support from France and,Great Britain, which is unlikely to be forthcoming. In fact, in the eyes of His Majesty&apos;s Government, the first two suggestions put forward by the French Government (1 (a) and (b) above) offer not only little prospect of averting
effectively the realisation of German aims in Austria, but might even provoke fresh pressure by the German on the Austrian Government, and further inter-ference in the internal affairs of Austria. *The third suggestion (1 (c) above) put forward in the memorandum of the French Government contemplates definite measures by the Western Powers with the object of preventing further methods similar to those employed at Berchtesgaden being used in Central Europe. The language suggested by the French Government implies a readiness on the part of the French and British Governments to have recourse to war in order to assert their will. This would involve a commitment which hitherto His Majesty&apos;s Government have refused to undertake, a decision which in present circumstances they are unable to reverse.On the other hand, Flis Majesty&apos;s Government share with the French Govern-ment their interest in doing whatever may be possible to stabilise the situation in Central Europe generally, and for that reason are always prepared to give careful consideration to measures for the consolidation of the Danubian States in the economic sphere. It is for this reason that His Majesty&apos;s Government have so warmly supported M. van Zeeland&apos;s efforts. They are, however, disposed to regard measures of this nature as likely only to prove effective over a period of time and if German collaboration is secured.As regards a political rapprochement between the Danubian States, more particularly between Austria and Czechoslovakia, it is not apparent how in present circumstances the British and French Governments could assist in efforts which the Danubian Governments may themselves be making in this sense. Nor do they conceive it likely that the Austrian Government will in present circum-stances be permitted to enter into any political agreement with the Czechoslovak Government. But His Majesty&apos;s Government will, it need hardly be said, be ready to consider any further suggestions which the French Government may have to make in these matters.Meanwhile, as Sir Eric Phipps has already informed M. Delbos on the 17th February, His Majesty&apos;s Government contemplate following up Lord Halifax&apos;s visit by initiating further conversations through the diplomatic channel with the German Chancellor, in the course of which it is hoped to ascertain how far the German Government are prepared to go in making a concrete contribution in respect of Central Europe and disarmament. These conversations would make it clear to the German Government that in the view of His Majesty&apos;s Government recent events have aroused apprehensions in many quarters which must inevitably render more difficult the negotiation of a general settlement, and that a general appeasement depends on the restoration and maintenance of confidence and stability in Austria and Czechoslovakia.For the above reasons His Majesty&apos;s Government feel that the steps which they hope to take in Berlin are more likely than the French proposals to create conditions favourable to peaceful development and the restoration of confidence in Central Europe, and less likely to precipitate events which it is the object of the Governments in London and Paris to avoid.The French Government may be disposed to agree that the speech made yesterday by the Austrian Chancellor shows that he himself appears to have some confidence that the arrangement made with Germany may yet enure to the benefit of relations between the two countries.His Majesty&apos;s Government agree that, however desirable Italian co-operation as regards the affairs of Central Europe may be, such co-operation cannot be counted upon in present circumstances. It would be unwise, therefore, for the two Governments to take the possibility of such co-operation into account in their immediate calculations. On the other hand, the forthcoming conversations which are to take place between His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Italian Government will at any rate afford an opportunity, &quot;which for the last year has been entirely, lacking, of ascertaining whether, and if so in what conditions, it might be possible, now or hereafter, to enlist at least the sympathetic interest of Italy in the problem with which Europe is now confronted as a result of the recent developments in Austria.Foreign Office, February 25, 1938.
