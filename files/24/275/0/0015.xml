(THIS DOCUIIEHT IS THE FRO PERT Y OF HIS BRITAIIhTC IvIAJES TY&apos; S GOVERNMENT ) .COPY Ho.SECRET.CP. No.  51/38.OA R IN E T. INDIA.Appreciation of the Political Situation, bjr the Government of India, dated 25rd February, 1938.Circulated for the information of the Cabinet by the Secretary of State for India.
Confidential appreciation of the Political Situation in India, dated the 23rd February, 1938 issued on the authority of the Secretary of State for India.1.      The problem of the release of &quot;political&quot; prisoners has been prominent ever since Congress Ministries assumed office in July,  1937.      The term &quot;political prisoners&quot; covers not only persons convicted of seditious speaking and similar offences, but also terrorist or revolutionary convicts sentenced for the most part to long terms of imprisonment for crimes of violence committed with a supposedly political motive, though in fact the political nature of the crime is often obscure and the offences committed were against the community in general.      The Congress party in their election manifesto announced their intention of working for the release of all x-)o!political prisoners at an early date,  and Congress ministries on assuming office raised the subject at once.     They were persuaded by theGovernor to follow a policy of gradual releases after examination of individual cases and, where possible, after obtaining assurances of good behaviour from the convicts as a preliminary to release.In accordance with this policy a large number of prisoners,  including- practically all these into whose offences the element of violence did not enter, have been set free:   among the Congress provinces the question attracted most notice in Bihar and the. United Provinces;    in Bengal and the Punjab where non-Congress ministries are in office, the numbers are far higher but the ministries have never attempted to introduce a policy of widespread releases.In January the problem became acute when a hunger-strike of political prisoners started in the Punjab and spread to Bihar and Bengal.     At the same time,
with the election to presidentship of the Congress party ox Subhas Bose, the well known Left-wing leader, the impending clash between the forces of order and disorder (referred to in the last appreciation) drew nearer, and the Right-wing1s apprehensions increased in view of the session of the All-India Congress to be held at Earipura in the middle of February.      In Bengal and the Punjab the ministries stood firm against the agitation for release, but combined pressure of hunger-strikes in Bihar, the danger of a similar strike in the United Provinces, and increasing pressure from the Left-wing, caused the Prime Ministers of these two provinces to depart from policy of gradual release in which they had previously acquiesced and to urge the Governor to. allow the immediate and unconditional release of all political prisoners still in the jails.The Bengal hunger-strike was abandoned on 4th February;    the Prime Minister of Bihar, with the added persuasions of the Congress  forking Committee, who passed a resolution condemning the hunger-strike, managed to get the hunger-strikers to call off their strike on 8th February,  but the Left-wing press persisted,  and in order to ward off criticism, the Working Committee is said to have authorised the Ministries in Bihar and the United Provinces to press for unconditional releases and, if necessary, to make the question a major issue.      On 14th February these two Ministries made their final demand, but the Governors concerned were unable to. agree to the demands without reference to the Governor-General, and in view of All-India coinsiderations, namely the great importance of examination of individual cases before approving
release and the immense pressure which indiscriminate releases in Bihar and united Provinces would bring to bear on Bengal, where there are over 400 political prisoners, the Governor-General was compelled to instruct the Governors to stand firm.      The Ministries thereupon tendered their resignations;    they have not yet been accepted and further developments are awaited.2.      In the Congress Working Committee meeting at Wardha from February 3rd to 6th the new President is said to have put up considerable  opposition to the moderate views of the Right Wing, who have been controlling policy for the past year.     Eis views however were not embodied in the resolutions passed, all of which continued to reflect the moderating influence of Gandhi. In spite of Bose&apos;s antagonism, the work of the Congress Ministries was applauded and a resolution on Federation was so worded that, though unequivocal condemnation of the federal scheme was again asserted, it is considered that the doer has still been left open for future deliberations.      Gandhi&apos;s influence is obvious both in the resolution condemning hunger-strikes and in that which prevented Congress interference in Indian States. The Working Committee met again at Haripura on 14th February to draft resolutions to be submitted to the All-India Committee.3.      Communal tension was evident in many parts of the country during the great Moslem festival of Bakr-Id. A Hindu-Moslem riot in Eissar, Punjab, resulted in three deaths and a number of injuries, but the situation was quickly controlled by local officers.
An example of the continued hostility to Congress oi* the Moslem League was an Incident in Cawnpore on 6th February.     A Congress procession in honour of a Moslem - Congress member of the Cabinet was attacked by a party of Moslem Leaguers and some SO persons were injured.      The situation was quickly controlled and the Congress ministry has vented its wrath on the police, who are accused of having taken inadequate precautions.4.      Internal differences brought about the resignation of the Assam Ministry, which was reconstituted under the same Prime Minister and with two other of its original members;    the new Cabinet is expected to be more stable out has recently narrowly escaped defeat over a motion cf &quot;no confidence&quot;.      The Legislatures of seven provinces have been in session;    the Agriculturists Relief Rill has passed both houses of the Madras Legislature and has been reserved for assent;    in the United Provinces a Bill to control sugar factories was passed, and the Bombay Government passed a number of Bills,  including a contentious Bill to amend the Local Boards  act, which aroused much opposition from the Moslem community.5. The economic position io satisfactory, except in Southern India, where scarcity conditions prevail in s cme quart e r s.6.      The situation in Waz iris tan continues to be fairly satisfactory. &apos;   In the middle of January the Spinwam post was attacked by a hostile gang from a base in Afghanistan;    the gang was dispersed with little difficulty.      The attack was instigated by the Faqir of
Ipi,   who is living in Ma&amp;da Khel country;    the Ivladda Khel have been ordered to expel him or accept responsibility for his behaviour;    failing compliance with these orders by the end of February,  it is proposed to take punitive action against them.
