THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Committee of Imperial Defence.  February 1938.SECRET. Copy No.1393-B.(Also Paper No. C.O.S. 677.)COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE.BAGHDAD-HAIFA ROAD. (Previous Paper No. CCS. 688.)Report by the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee.IN accordance with a request by the Standing Official Sub-Committee for Questions Concerning the Middle East,* we have had under consideration the question of the construction of a road between Haifa and Baghdad, in accordance with the following terms of reference :  &apos; ;&quot;To consider the strategical aspects of a road between Haifa and Baghdad, to report on the degree of priority to be assigned to such a project in relation to the defence programmes generally, and, if the construction of such a road is recommended, to report on the type of road required.53Strategical.2. Up to the present, the consideration given to the question of road communications across Transjordan, by the Standing Official Sub-Committee for Questions Concerning the Middle East, has been based on our requirements for the defence of our interests in Iraq including, in particular, facilities for reinforcing, in case of necessity, the Royal Air Force base at Dhibban. In consequence when, in April 1935,1&quot; the Committee of Imperial Defence took note of a report (C.I.D. Paper 1169-B) on the question of communications between Baghdad and Haifa, the only requirement was for movement from West to East. The conclusions reached in the above-mentioned report were &quot;(1)*    (a) Strategically.The construction of a standard-gauge railway from Haifa to Baghdad would, in certain eventualities be valuable, but could not be held to be essential. A good road would, however, be necessary in any case.M. Ai. JL Ji. Jf.TT -        TP W nf&quot; &quot;A* -A&quot;(3) That the question of providing and maintaining road communications of the requisite standard between Baghdad and Haifa .... should be actively pursued.&quot;As a result the Air Ministry estimated that a road for military requirements could be constructed at a cost of  200,000 and sanction for this expenditure was given in March 1937. If this road was to suffice to meet the minimum Military requirements it could only do so provided it was not used for commercial traffic, which was scarcely a practicable position.* M.E. (O.) 55th Meeting.f C.I.D./269th Meeting, Minute 13.[16608]
3. The present situation in the Mediterranean has now introduced a new factor of primary strategical importance, in that, in the event of war with Italy, the road will now be required to carry a considerable flow of administrative traffic in both directions in connection with the maintenance of the Air forces operating in Egypt, and may also be needed for the move of the initial reinforce-ments from India. In the event of such a war, Egypt will assume major strategical importance, since whoever controls Egypt can control the Suez Canal. The control of Egypt therefore enables us to cut Italy&apos;s direct communications with her East African Colonies; and it is also necessary for the security of Alexandria which, in war, would be our main fleet base in the Eastern Mediterranean. The provision of reinforcements for the defence of Egypt will, therefore, be our main security measure.4. The despatch of army and air reinforcements to Egypt or Palestine by sea must follow either the route, through the Central Mediterranean or that via the Red Sea. Italy occupies a very strong position in the Central Mediterranean, since her home resources are concentrated there. Our convoys would be exposed to attack by the main Italian fleet, and as regards air attack we have expressed in a previous Paper (Paper No. C.O.S. 500) the opinion that pending war experience we cannot rely, during the first few weeks of hostilities, on shipping army and air reinforcements through the Mediterranean to Egypt. The time factor in connection with the reinforcement of Egypt is all important and it may, therefore, be necessary to rely on reinforcements from India in the first instance. In the Red Sea Area also however, Italy occupies an excellent position to enable her to carry out air attack on our shipping, particularly in the opening phases when her stocks of bombs and other air material in East Africa are undiminished; and, in the circumstances which would require that the main strength of the British fleet should be divided between the Far East and Home waters, with only light forces at Alexandria and Aden, it may be difficult to ensure the regular use of the Red Sea as a supply route to Egypt, although periodically adequate naval, A.A. escort may be made available.5. Our air communications to India and the Far East pass through Palestine, Trans Jordan and Iraq, and the maintenance of our facilities in the latter country will, for some time to come, remain an essential strategical require-ment. The depot at Dhibban will be indispensable for the maintenance of our increased air forces operating in Egypt, and has the particular advantage of being out of range of Italian air attack. To enable full use to be made of the repair facilities and the organisation for the salvage and reconditioning of damaged aircraft, efficient ground communications, in which a road through Palestine and Trans Jordan forms an essential link, would be necessary between Egypt and Dhibban.6. From the strategical considerations set out above, it is clear that the road under consideration would be extremely valuable,&apos; not only for the movement of forces from west to east (see paragraphs 2 and 5 above), but also as a secure overland route for the movement of reinforcements to, and the subsequent main-tenance of, our forces in Egypt and Palestine in the event of war with Italy (see paragraphs 3 and 4 above). It is therefore of great importance, from the military point of view, that the route should be developed.Priority in relation to the defence programme generally.7. We have shown above that the project is directly related to the defence of Egypt, on which depends the security of the Suez Canal, which is a vital link in our Imperial communications. The security of Egypt is, moreover, the key to the defence of all British territories and interests in the Near and Middle East and North-East Africa. We therefore consider that the construction of this road should be assigned a high priority in accordance with the policy recently adumbrated by the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence (and subse-quently approved by the Cabinet*), in the following terms : . . . our first and main- effort must be directed to two principal objectives, namely, to protecting this country against attack, and to preserving the trade routes on which we depend for essential imports of food and raw material.* Cabinet 48 (37), Conclusion 9, and Cabinet 49 (37), Conclusion 1.
43.   Our third objective is the maintenance of forces for the defence of British territories overseas, against attack by sea, land and air.....&quot;Type of Road.8. The Western section of the overland route, between Haifa and Jisr-el-Mejamie, in Palestine, is a first-class tarmac road, and at the other end the Iraqi Government have recently continued the good road via Ramadi towards the Transjordan frontier.It only therefore remains to complete the link through Transjordan by the development of the present desert track.As we have already shown in paragraphs 3 and 4 above the route will now be required to take much heavier traffic than was first envisaged by the Air Ministry. Its continuous use, in all weathers, will be essential for the main-tenance of the Air Forces operating in Egypt, and it may also have to be used for the passage of reinforcements for our land forces.In these changed circumstances we are satisfied that the type of road construction envisaged in the original Air Ministry proposal would prove inadequate even if it proved practicable to keep it closed to commercial traffic. Moreover, we notice that since the Air Ministry&apos;s original estimate was drawn up it has been discovered that in certain sections of the route the foundations are not as good as was thought. We therefore strongly recommend that the War Office proposal for a road capable of carrying the heavy military loads which we must now expect to have to move by this route should be adopted. A detailed survey has been carried out and the cost is estimated at  600,000.9. It has been suggested* that we might be able to use the desert route from Baghdad to Damascus, instead of building a road for Ourselves, since we could always count on friendly assistance from France. We do not consider this a satisfactory alternative for the following reasons :  (a) It is quite conceivable that in a unilateral war with Italy, Frenchpermission to use this road would be withheld.(b) If the proposed Treaty between France and Syria is ratified, the latter will become an independent State by 1941, and we could not therefore rely on the use of the route after that date.(c) The route is only a desert track similar to the Transjordan stretch ofthe Baghdad-Haifa road with which our proposal is concerned and requires&apos;a special type of desert vehicle.(d) In order to satisfy the requirements we have set out in paragraph 8above an expenditure similar to that we are now considering would have to be incurred.We are therefore unable to see any advantage in adopting the above suggestion.Time Factor.10. It is most desirable that sanction should be given for this expenditure at the earliest possible moment, so that arrangements may be made for the construction of the road to start in June of this year. It is necessary for the preparation of the road to be completed, so that the earth can settle down, during the next rainy season which starts in October. The surfacing cannot be commenced before the end of the rainy season in March 1939. We consider that in view of the strategical importance of the road the delay of a whole year, which would occur if the rainy season of 1938-39 is not utilised for the settling down of the disturbed earth, is not acceptable. We, therefore, strongly urge that the surfacing of the road should be commenced as soon as possible so that the road can be ready for use by the winter of 1939-40. If this is to be done, an immediate decision must be taken so that the necessary preparatory action can be taken by the War Office.(Signed) CHATFIELD.C. L. NEW ALL.
