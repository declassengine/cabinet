(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT. )i JSECRET Copy NO. . 7. . T!.CP. 70   (38) CABINETHours of Employment of Young Persons in Certain Unregulated Occupations. &apos;Memorandum by the Home secretary-etary.I am anxious to introduce as soon as possible a Bill to give effect to the outstanding recommendations of the Departmental Committee on the Hours of Employment of Young persons in Certain Unregulated Occupations which -reported in January,  1937.This Bill was included in the legislative programme forthe 1937-8 Session in the category of &quot;useful and mainlyxnon-controversial&quot; measures.The recommendations of the Committee relate to the employment of van boys, errand boys,.messengers, porters or warehouse boys, in connection with any commercial or industrial undertaking, and page boys and lift boys or other attendants in hotels or places of public entertainment.      The Committee also referred to certain other &quot;border line&quot; employments, which were not specified in the Committee&apos;s terms of reference but which they thought should be included in the scheme of restriction -viz.    page boys in Clubs, lift boys in offices or blocks of flats and certain othex- miscellaneous employments.The main recommendations of the Committee, following theprinciple of the Shops Act, 1934, (which dealt with the hours of young persons employed in the distributive trades) were for the fixing by statute of a 48-hour working week for these youngpersons, with a limited amount of overtime for young persons of16 and over.      There were also subsidiax-y recommendationsrelating to daily period of employment, night work, weeklyhalf-holidays , etc.___x   The reference to the Bill as a measure to deal with &quot;hours of young persons in shops etc.&quot; (page 7 of Annex 1 to the 11th Conclusions (37) Committee of Home Affairs) was not quite accurate.
The Committee&apos;s x*e commendations have already been implemented so far as concerns van boys, errand boys, etc., in factories by cex*tain px-provisions in the Factoi*ies   Act, 1937, and the pux-pose of the present Bill would be to deal with the remainder.I have stated in answer to questions in the House of Commons that I am anxious to see this legislation passed and hope that there may be time for it during the present Session. The feeling in Parliament is stx*ongly in favour of further regulation of hours of employment for young persons and I do not anticipate that there can be any substantial controversy in relation to the provisions, of the Bill.     The Trades Union Congress General Council, after consultation with the Pax*liamentax*y Labour Pax*ty, have given me an assurance (without pledging themselves absolutely until they have seen the Bill) that if the measure covex*s the young persons referred to in the Committee&apos;s report &quot;the Opposition will give every facility fox&apos; its passage into law within a minimum of time, and would not make it an oppox-tunity fox* a demand fox- the x*eduction of hours below 48 pei* week.&quot;Final decisions have still to be taken on certain of the Committee&apos;s recommendations, including those x-elating to cex&apos;tain of the &quot;border line&quot; cases.Thei&apos;e is also one subsidiax*y, but impox&apos;tant point to be settled, viz.    whether the Shops Act, 1934, should be amended so as to provide a 44 hour week fox* young pex&apos;sons under 16 employed in the distributive trades.     A provision to this effect was included in the Factories Act, 1937, and would also be applied to the young persons to be covered by the pi*esent Bill, and it will undoubtedly be demanded that the Shops Act, 1934, should be brought into line in this respect.      I hope that it
S.H.15th March,  1958.will be possible to include this provision in the Bill, and I am at present in consultation in the matter with the principal organisations representing employers in the distx-ibutive trade s.If the Cabinet are prepared to give approval in principle to the introduction of the Bill to give effect to the Committee&apos;s recommendations, these outstanding points might, I suggest, be considered by the Home Affairs Committee when the Bill comes before them.It would, I think, be convenient and appropriate that the Bill should be intx*produced in the Lords, who, I understand, would welcome more wor*k of this character at the present time.I have consulted the secretary*etary of State for Scotland who concurs in these proposals.
