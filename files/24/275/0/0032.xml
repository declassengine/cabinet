Spain.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I CIRCULATE to my colleagues a memorandum regarding certain difficulties regarding Spain connected with the Anglo-Italian conversations. This paper was recently circulated to the Committee on Foreign Policy as F.P. (36) 55.H.March 16, 1938.I THINK it is desirable for the Cabinet to consider a difficulty that may arise in connexion with our Italian conversations.2. The Prime Minister gave an assurance to the House of Commons on the 21st February that His Majesty&apos;s Government would not complete the Anglo-Italian negotiations unless &apos;&apos; the agreement contained a settlement of the Spanish question.&quot; His Majesty&apos;s Government have, however, never defined the precise meaning which they place upon this expression &quot; settlement of the Spanish question.&quot;3. I have always assumed that this meant a settlement from the international point of view; that is to say that a satisfactory stage must have been reached in the execution of the policy of non-intervention, comprising the prohibition to supply arms, munitions or volunteers to either party in Spain, and that the British plan for the withdrawal of foreign volunteers, the restoration of the land frontier observers, the strengthening of the sea observation scheme and the eventual grant of limited belligerent rights to both Spanish parties should be well on its way to realisation.4. At the present time all parties to the non-intervention agreement profess to be carrying out its terms, despite the fact that the system of observation on the land-frontiers with Portugal and France is not in operation and the sea-control scheme is only partially functioning. The British plan for the withdrawal of foreign volunteers has been submitted to the Governments concerned.5. But the successful execution of this plan is a matter of international co-operation and does not depend ewchisinely on Italian goodwill and good faith. Foreign volunteers cannot be withdrawn from Spain without the loyal and active9764   [16849] b
co-operation of all Governments parties to the Non-intervention Agreement together with that of the two Spanish parties. The plan is costly, and His Majesty&apos;s Government have not as yet taken any definite decision to commit themselves to undertake the full financial burden attributed to them under the scheme. On this point I am still in correspondence with the Chancellor of the Exchequer.6. The time-table is an important element. The shortest possible time in which the withdrawal of foreign volunteers can be completed is one hundred days from the final adoption of the resolution by the Non-intervention Committee, after that resolution has been accepted by the two Spanish parties; while the minimum period which must elapse before actual withdrawal begins is forty-five days from the same date. It is impossible at the presenftime to give any estimate as to when the Non-intervention Committee will be in a position to adopt its resolution; but this must in any event be a matter of weeks, for the adoption of the resolution depends upon the solution of a number of rather obstinate questions.7. In the first place there is a divergence of view as to the basis figure on which &quot; substantial progress &quot;in the withdrawal of volunteers, with its corollary of the grant of limited belligerent rights, should be reckoned. Lord Plymouth is not unhopeful that on this point, after a good deal more argument, it may be possible to reach agreement.8. In the second place, the French Government, supported by the Soviet Government, basing themselves on a unanimous resolution of the Non-intervention Committee of the 4th November last, have argued that observation should not be restored on the land frontiers until the two Commissions, which are to be sent to Spain, have submitted their reports to London and these reports have been accepted by the Committee. The German, Italian and Portuguese Governments, on the other hand, have with some reason objected that so long as the land frontiers remain open, it is impossible for the Commissions to report accurately the numbers of volunteers serving on either side in Spain, as movements backwards and forwards across these frontiers can take place while the process of counting is in progress. Their agreement to the fixing of a basic figure for withdrawal of volunteers is therefore made dependent on the restoration of land frontier control so soon as the two Commissions reach Spanish soil. His Majesty&apos;s Government are endeavouring to bring the two views on this point nearer to a compromise, and have endeavoured to secure the co-operation of the French Government in their efforts. But the reply of the latter which has now been received does not solve the difficulty.9. This brings me to a difficulty of another kind. The policy of non-intervention in Spain was initiated by the French Government with the strong support of His Majesty&apos;s Government. We are endeavouring to ensure the success of that policy by maintaining close touch and acting in complete accord with the French in the International Committee. Unfortunately, however, a growing divergence between the attitude of the two Governments is gradually becoming manifest. His Majesty&apos;s Government are concerned solely to make the policy of non-intervention effective by all means in their power and more particularly by working in frank co-operation with all other interested Govern-ments. The French Government seem unable to divest themselves of an ingrained distrust of the good faith of the Italian Government which they are, moreover, reluctant to put to the test. Partly, no doubt, also for reasons of internal policy they seem not so much concerned to co-operate in bringing the work of the Committee to a successful issue, as to avoid any course of action which may be interpreted by their own public as constituting a concession to the Italian point of view.10. The difficulty mentioned in paragraph 8 affords an illustration of this attitude. The resulting situation may resolve itself into a deadlock and the question may then arise as to the attitude which His Majesty&apos;s Government must take up as between the divergent views of the other parties. Whether they will be faced with this dilemma in this particular instance still remains to be seen. It may be that some way can still be found to resolve the deadlock which now threatens. Even so, it must be recognised that sooner or later His Majesty&apos;s Government may find themselves at issue with the French Government in the Committee&apos;s work, owing  to what they  may regard  as the unreasonable
reluctance of the latter to contribute their share to the general spirit of concession required for a successful outcome of the Committee&apos;s labours. But a successful outcome of the Committee&apos;s labours is essential and within as short a time as possible, if a settlement of the Spanish question is to come in sight and the Anglo-Italian conversations are to be completed. His Majesty&apos;s Government may have-to be prepared to use all their influence with the French Government to carry them along in this work of settlement; and if their efforts are met with insufficient response or even with obstructive tactics they may find themselves compelled to make a choice between the alternative courses (1) of supporting their French friends in an attitude which His Majesty&apos;s Government may consider unreason-able or obstructive, at the risk of splitting the Committee into two camps and wrecking its chances of success, as well as destroying all hope of a successful outcome of the Anglo-Italian conversations, or (2) of bringing pressure to bear on the French Government to make concessions which will be most unwelcome to them, with the possibility of producing a breach in their present friendly co-operation and even a progressive deterioration in their general future relations with consequences that cannot be foreseen.11. It is clear from the above illustrations of the difficulties involved in the execution of the British plan that the plan now under discussion may be wrecked by the attitude of the French or Soviet Governments or by some other unforeseen cause wholly unconnected with Italy. Alternatively, General Franco may be the cause of the failure of the plan by his failure to co-operate loyally in its execution, or the Spanish Government might be found to be the obstructive party.12. In the event of any obstacles of the above nature arising, it would not be fair to expect the Italian Government to carry out their withdrawal of volunteers alone or, indeed, otherwise than jjari passu with others.13. Even assuming that all parties agree to the plan and that all concerned co-operate loyally and actively in the arrangements for securing the withdrawal of foreign volunteers from Spain, it will remain for consideration at what stage in the execution of the plan His Majesty&apos;s Government would feel themselves at liberty to complete the Anglo-Italian negotiations, supposing that they have in other respects proceeded satisfactorily. In other words, at what stage in the execution of the plan is it proposed that His Majesty&apos;s Government shall consider that the settlement of the Spanish question is being or has been achieved ? It is evident that the rate of progress of the negotiations for the withdrawal of foreign volunteers from Spain cannot at the present moment be gauged, and that it is impossible to foresee what events within or outside the Non-intervention Committee may occur to affect that progress adversely. At best, these negotiations cannot be completed for a considerable time.  ^14.   The time factor is important from two points of view :-(1) The Council of the League is due to meet on the 9th May, and I much hope that it may be possible to take such action as may be decided in regard to moving the League to free our hands about Abyssinia at that meeting.   The next meeting of the Council would not be till September, and provided our Italian conversations go well, I do not think we ought to take the risk of allowing the resulting provisional agreement to stand over in storage so long.  The consequences of such a delay would be highly dangerous, if not actually disastrous to the prospects of ultimate agreement.   Count Ciano is already (see Lord -.  Perth&apos;s telegram No. 119, attached as Annex No. 1) professing concern at having to wait till May. (2) We must anticipate that the Italian conversations will be ripe for conclusion, if things go well, before the stage of actual withdrawal of volunteers has been reached in Spain.15. It seems therefore essential that His Majesty&apos;s Government should consider how far they can afford to allow delay in the settlement of the Spanish question not due exclusively or perhaps at all to Italian fault, to block the conclusion of their agreement with Italy, with all the consequences of its possible collapse that delay might involve.16.   I should like to think that there was a fair chance of this very real difficulty not arising; but I confess to a feeling of something like certainty that, [16849] B 2
however well things go on the Non-intervention Committee, the scheme of with-drawal, &amp;c., will not, in fact, be operating by the time the Council meets (the &apos;9th May). There is, indeed, good reason to fear that not only will the scheme itself not be operating by that date, but that the resolution required for the enforcement of that scheme may, at the present rate of progress, not have been passed by the Committee by the 9th May. If so, it looks like our ultimately having to choose between two alternatives. Either we may have to stick to the literal fulfilment of the Spanish &quot; condition,&quot; interpreted in the sense of paragraph 3 above, whether delay was or was not the fault of Italy, with our eyes wide open to the possible consequences of delay; or we may have at some stage in the proceedings to tell the House of Commons frankly why it is not possible to implement the Prime Minister&apos;s undertaking that the agreement with Italy would be contingent on a settlement of the Spanish question, so understood.17. My own tentative view is that-if I was personally convinced of the good faith of the Italian Government in the matter, I should favour telling the House of Commons exactly how the delay arose whether due to the other parties or to unexpected difficulties of machinery and explaining that, in the circumstances, as His Majesty&apos;s Government were satisfied of the good faith of the Italian Government, they did not propose to hold up the Anglo-Italian Agreement pending a Spanish settlement. Lord Perth&apos;s telegram No. 119 shows that the Italian Government themselves may be expected to press very strongly for this course of action.18. On the other hand, there is no doubt that opinion in this country will be most suspicious of any apparent departure from the Prime Minister&apos;s under-taking unless the grounds for doing so are patent and convincing. Moreover, unless the Anglo-Italian Agreement can be concluded in an atmosphere relatively free from acrimony, we shall be in danger of future relations again being jeopardised by press attacks and speeches from the Opposition a result which presumably the Italians themselves would wish to avoid.19. If His Majesty&apos;s Government are to go so far as so greatly to modify, for whatever good reasons, the policy so recently announced by the Prime Minister in this regard, I feel myself that the Italian Government for their part should be prepared to make their contribution by some gesture affording proof of their good intentions. In these circumstances and for these reasons, I think that we must resist Italian pressure designed to induce us to agree at this stage to committing ourselves to the separation of the Spanish question from the Rome negotiations. We should, however, be prepared in our own minds to contemplate informing the House of Commons of our intention of doing so if and zvhen convincing proof can be adduced that the delay in the settlement of the Spanish question is not due to Italian obstruction. The position might perhaps be helped if we could get the Italian Government to make some gesture e.g., a token withdrawal, a total withdrawal of airmen, or a total withdrawal from the Balearics, calculated to impress public opinion favourably. Failing this, it might y perhaps be possible to invite the Italian Government to furnish us, in advance of the execution of the British plan for Spain, with a firm undertaking that they will accept and carry out, pari passzi with other Governments concerned, reasonable proposals which His Majesty&apos;s Government would submit to them for assuring and expediting the settlement of the Spanish question. The receipt of such assurances might be of help to overcome obstruction from other quarters in the proceedings of the Committee, and enable His Majesty&apos;s Government to adopt a firmer line, in particular with the French Government. It is, however, I suppose, too much to expect; that any assurances from the Italian Government, in advance of demonstrable action, would be accepted in the House as sufficient guarantee that a settlement of the Spanish question was being achieved.20. There is one other matter which we should bear in mind. The Prime Minister stated in the House of Commons on the 21st February that, if an Anglo-Italian agreement were achieved, we should desire to obtain the approval of the League for it. It is suggested that this undertaking should be regarded as having been fulfilled if at the next meeting of the Council we seek to obtain from the latter some pronouncement which would have the effect of freeing the hands of those members of the League who have hitherto refrained, out of loyalty to the League, from regularising their relations with Italy.   Such an interpretation
of the Prime Minister&apos;s undertaking should be readily defensible, as it is clear that the recognition question is the only one arising on the Italian conversations for which League approval could possibly be necessary.21. In this connexion there is a further possible difficulty. What is to happen if, when we go to Geneva to ask the Council to free the hands of League Powers to recognise the Italian position in Abyssinia, the Council proves unwilling to do so ?22. The form in which our approach might be made is still under discussion, and it may be that on the form ultimately decided may in part depend whether or not it will be possible to secure a satisfactory Council resolution on the subject.23. There is, indeed, good ground for the view that we are not bound by any provision of the Covenant (though the League has in the past adopted certain resolutions which may be regarded as applicable) to seek liberty of action at the hands of the League, as we propose to do. Some sixteen Powers, members of the League, have not done so (see list attached as Annex No. 2). Of these, Poland, Roumania, Latvia and Ecuador are represented on the Council.24. We should propose to make such diplomatic preparation as we could with other Powers, including the United States of America, as well as the Dominions, but, in the event of the Council being unwilling formally to grant liberty of action, I should hope that it might be possible so to guide discussion at Geneva along the lines of individual declarations as in fact, in the last resort, to facilitate the action of recognising Italian sovereignty by ourselves and other members of the Council who may wish to do so. This could not be regarded, how-ever, as a satisfactory method of dealing with the matter either from the point of view of the League or of public opinion in this country, and any general know-ledge in advance of the Council meeting that such was our intention would in all probability defeat our efforts to secure our first objective of a satisfactory Council resolution.  I therefore put it forward with some hesitation.25. In any event, I think that we should only be justified in taking action at the May Council if we were really satisfied of the good faith of the Italian Government in the execution of the agreement at which we should have arrived. &quot;Good faith&quot; is obviously difficult of definition; but I cannot suggest any better test.26.   My conclusions therefore would be : (1) That we should tell the Italians we could not move at Geneva before the 9th May, and then only if we were satisfied on the other matters under discussion between us, and on their general attitude to Spain.(2) That we should do everything in our power to press on the Non-Inter-vention Committee&apos;s progress, even if this involves putting strong-pressure on the French.(3) That we should be prepared, if satisfied of Italian good faith generally and in regard to Spain, to tell Parliament why we thought it right to ask authority to give a practical interpretation to the Prime Minister&apos;s undertaking of the 21st February.(4) That we should regard an approach to the League on the recognition question as fulfilling the Prime Ministers undertaking to seek League approval for an Anglo-Italian agreement, and that we should, again on the condition of being satisfied of Italian good faith, be prepared to take action, even if the Council of the League was unwilling or unable to reach corporately what we should regard as a favourable decision. But any general knowledge in advance of the Council meeting that such is our intention would render very much more difficult, if not impossible, the achievement of any Council resolution on the subject.H.March 11, 1938.
GThe Earl of Perth to Viscount Halifax. (Received March 9.) (No. 119.   Immediate.)(Telegraphic.) Rome, March 8, 1938.MY immediately preceding telegram.(h) Abyssinian   Questions. 1. Recognition  of   Italian   sovereignty  over Abyssinia.I gave Count Ciano the formula relating to recognition of Italian sovereignty over Abyssinia.  Count Ciano enquired when we intended to approach the League for purposes indicated.  I said I anticipated no action could be taken before the Council meeting in early days of May.  Count Ciano asked whether it would not be possible to have a special meeting at a much earlier date, since he believed and hoped that we could come to rapid settlement of all other questions placed on the agenda; perhaps in two or three weeks.   I observed that even if we did so, there was still the question of settlement of Spanish problem.   Count Ciano stated that he did not understand my interpretation of position.   According to Count Grandi&apos;s reports of his conversations with Prime Minister and Mr. Eden, we had declared that we were ready to begin conversations as soon as Italian Government had agreed to British formula about withdrawal of volunteers.   I said that this&apos; was so and conversations had now begun.   Count Ciano asked whether I meant that conclusion of conversations was dependent on another factor, namely, not only acceptance by Italian Government of British formula, but on its practical application.   I answered that this was my view.   Count Ciano asked what such practical application involved.   Would it mean that we must delay our agreement until a sufficient number of volunteers had been with-drawn to allow belligerent rights to be granted to General Franco ?   I replied that this was a point which at present I could not answer.  Count Ciano begged me to obtain information from my Government as soon as possible, as it was naturally a question of the greatest importance to Italian Government.   He sent for records of Count Grandi&apos;s communications to Rome and read me portions of them.   It was clear that some misunderstanding had arisen either in Count GrandFs mind or in that of Count Ciano.   (It seems to me probable that this misunderstanding arises out of the words &quot; a settlement of Spanish question &quot; in paragraph 4 of your despatch No. 236.   Count Grandi appears to have interpreted that expression as if acceptance of formula was the equivalent of its practical application.)   Count Ciano asked what would be the position between conclusion of our present conversations and May Council meeting.   I answered that I imagined that we should have to place settlement in cold storage till we could release it by recognition of sovereignty.   I suggested that perhaps some joint statement could be made explaining the position.   Count Ciano, who was obviously unhappy at the delay involved, since he greatly desires a speedy agreement, remarked that &quot; settlement &quot; of Spanish question might postpone conclusion of agreement even beyond the Council meeting.   He assured me that Italian Government had every intention of implementing logically and fully their acceptance of British formula.After long discussion, we agreed to leave the matter in abeyance for the time being. Count Ciano is to see Count Grandi to-morroAv, and I promised to telegraph you that this point was one to which Count Ciano attached the greatest importance, and it is likely to prove most difficult.ANNEX 2./ .\/ . / League Members whp have Recognised de jure the Italian Sovereignty overEthiopia.Austria s Ecuador (Council).Hungary. &quot; *     :&quot;. &apos; NicaraguaSwitzerland.
