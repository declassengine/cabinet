HERR HITLER&apos;S SPEECH 20th,  FEBRUARY,   1958. SJJMMARY.Explaining why he had not made his speech on the anniversary of his accession to power Herr Hitler said:&quot;The selection of this date is due to two considerations: (l)    I thought it right to make certain personal changes before-hand.(2)    It was necessary to bring about an urgently necessary clarification in one specific sphere of foreign politics because such a speech of mine does not only deal with the past but also with the future.,&quot;After reviewing the rise of the National Socialist Party since he became Chancellor Herr Hitler explained that the day he assumed power was a turning point in German history0After emphasising the bloodless nature of the Nazi revol-ution the Chancellor said in spite of the really exemplary discipline, strength and restraint which the National Socialists preserved in the revolution we have seen that a certain portion of the foreign press has inundated the new Reich with a virtual flood of lies and calumniesoIt was a remarkable mixture of arrogance and deplorable ignorance which led them to act as the judges of a people, who should have served instead as models to these democratic apostles.The Chancellor described the poverty and unemployment which he found in Germany in January 1933,      In order to deal with these catastrophic conditions he had been obliged to take far reaching measures immediately without feeling himself tied by parliamentary usage and. the democratic outlook.     Whoever dis-disturbed him in his mission was an enemy of the people.In such a time of necessity those who act in the name of God are not those who with sentences from the bible wander idly about the country and spend the day partly doing nothing and partly criticising the work of others, but those whose prayers
HERR HITLER&apos;S SPEECH 20th,  FEBRUARY,   1938. SJJHMARYoExplaining why he had not made his speech cn the anniversary of his accession to power Herr Hitler said:&quot;The selection of this date is due to two considerations: (l)    I thought it right to make certain personal changes before-hand.(2)    It was necessary to bring about an urgently necessary clarification in one specific sphere of foreign politics because such a speech of mine does not only deal with the past but also with the future&quot;After reviewing the rise of the National Socialist Party since he became Chancellor Herr Hitler explained that the day he assumed power was a turning point in German historyoAfter emphasising the bloodless nature of the Nazi revol-ution the Chancellor said in spite of the really exemplary discipline, strength and restraint which the National Socialists preserved in the revolution we have seen that a certain portion of the foreign press has inundated the new Reich with a virtual flood of lies and calumniesoIt was a remarkable mixture of arrogance and deplorable ignorance which led them to act as the judges of a people, who should have served instead as models to these democratic apostles.The Chancellor described the poverty and unemployment which he found in Germany in January 1933*      In order to deal with these catastrophic conditions he had been obliged to take far reaching measures immediately without feeling himself tied by parliamentary usage and the democratic outlook.     Whoever dis-disturbed him in his mission was an enemy of the people.In such a time of necessity those who act in the name of God are not those who with sentences from the bible wander idly about the country and spend the day partly doing nothing and partly criticising the work of others, but those whose prayers
take the highest form uniting the man with his God, the form of work (loud and enthusiastic cheers).I had the right to turn against everyone, who instead of helping, thought his mission was to criticise our work. If Germany is today a nation that has been saved economically then it is up to the leaders of the people not to undo the work that the nation has donec     Foreign nations have contributed nothing - this remark was followed by a storm of applause - apart from a spirit of rejection tinged by hate or a spirit of knowing better than we know, but they have contributed nothing which could have been of positive value to the German people, let alone help. I never expected anything else0      It was the A.Be Co  of our creed to find help in our own strengthoHerr   Hitler then expounded the National Socialist &quot;Economic Creed&quot;,,He said:    &quot;The standard of living of nation is the outcome of its total production&quot;,,Herr Hitler then referred to currency problems,&quot;The National Socialist Economic Programme&quot; he said, &quot;is not so much a financial programme but a programme of production.,     Money is only an auxiliary means in the distribution of goods.     Moreover in order to give the nation that position in the world which it needs for the \mhampered carrying out of its vital tasks, additional production for armaments is to take place which benefits the population only indirectly,,&quot;In view of all this it was impossible to link up Germany&apos;s salvation with swindling currency manipulationso&quot;In other words it was impossible to cheat our people with sliding wage and price scales,,      what was necessary was to give
to the increasing income of the people a permanent purchasing power by the aid of an increased production&quot;The Chancellor then gave statistics to show how the national income and production had risen since 1932.He said:&quot;There is only one power in Germany and that is national socialism.      It has not merely mobilised the country but has organised it,,&quot;Herr Hitler then announced that Germany would recognise Manchukuo 0He continued:&quot;If it puts foreign circles   at their ease,  they are at liberty to believe that there is a difference of opinion between national socialists and the army.&quot;But they may rest assured that if necessity arises the army will know how to strike.&quot;&quot;Foreign journalists only harm our achievements by their stammering activities.     We would not mind if it were not that it endangers peace but fortunately we have the means at our disposal to make these  !world poisoners&apos; at our borders.&quot;Herr Hitler then thanked Generals von Blomberg and von Pritsch for the way they had worked at re-building the German army and added &quot;There is no conflict between the army and national Socialism.&quot;&quot;Germany is passing through a very difficult time.    If Great Britain were suddenly dissolved and England was left on its own, England might understand us better.&quot;We are opposed to any expansion of Bolshevism.    I fear that a Japanese defeat would not aid Europe and the United States of Amercia but only Soviet Russia.      I do not consider that China is strong enough mentally to exist.
Germany has no territorial interest in Spain.The German Government would regard Bolshevism in power in Spain as a disturbance of European equilibrium in which they would not be disinterested,&quot;Germany has no differences with Great Britain, colonies excepted&quot;,&quot;Germany and Italy have the same goal in the Spanish conflict .ooo-.&quot;&quot;Germany has no more territorial claims against Prance after the return of the Saar 00 , .. e &quot;&quot;Germany will always regard Japan as a factor of security.&quot;Hitler then referred to labour and social institutions.Hen- Hitler said &quot;Next to the United States Gexmany has to-day become the greatest steel country in the world&quot; (Applause).He went on:    &quot;I could give many more examples.      They are documentary proof of work such as our people have never before achieved,      To these successes will be added in a few years the gigantic results of the four years planQ&quot;What have fatuous critics at home and abroad to say in the face of such an achievement of world proportions? The scribbling of ignorant or malicious journalists or of impotent parliamentarians?    Is it not a joke of history when those very countries which themselves have only crises think they can criticise us and give us advice&quot;.&quot;What poisons the atmosphere is a poisonous press incitement&quot;.&quot;I aril no more willing to tolerate this&quot;,&quot;We shall henceforth reply with national socialist thoroughness&quot;.&quot;What is one to say if Reuter invents attacks on my life or the closing of frontiers?     or other papers
say that the Crown Prince has fled and that I am in a difficult position (laughterj and that I have lost ,uy voice?&quot;o&quot;I admit that a section of the foreign press does not take part in this incitement.&quot;&quot;It is worse when papers incite to war:    when,  for instance,  it was said last year that Germany landed 20,000 troops in Morocco&quot;,&quot;Can one speak here of an honourable profession?   are they not war-inciters of the worst kind?&quot;c&quot;In view of the inciting press campaign we believe that for the time being the way of diplomatic exchange of notes is the only procedure we can follow.&quot;Referring to Spain the Chancellor said:&quot;The goal which Germany and Italy had in the Spanish conflict was a Nationalist independent Spain&quot;0As regards Austria he said:&quot;One thing is beyond doubt,  the general right of self-determination cannot be disregarded because this is the case concerning Germany&quot;,,&quot;An unbearable   situation might have led to a serious catastrophe.&quot;&quot;I am hoping that the Austrian Chancellor was of my opinion.      I want to thank him for it.     We are all    sons of one people.     No matter where the cradle stood&quot;(applause and cheers) .In a further reference to Austria he said:&quot;Perhaps all this will help to lesson the tension in Europe.      It is my desire that our co-operation with Italy and Japan may increase&quot;.
&quot;I recommend that deputies of the House of Commons should enquire into the verdicts of the British military courts in Palestine and not into those of our people&apos;s courtso&quot;It is I who ueci de the fate of germany and not a delegation of British leader-writers.&quot;I have therefore maae up my .uind to carry out that strengthening of the German army, as decided upon on 4th February &quot;.Speaking earlier of the peaceful character of the Nazi revolution the Fuhrer said:&quot;Shall I remind you of the great example of all revolutions when the guillotine indulged in orgies   or of the   Bolshevist revolution which slaughtered millions upon millions of people whose blood-stained umrderers, however,    occupy high places in the Councils of democratic institutions.&quot;Shall I remind you of the slaughtering csrrieu. out by the Marxists mobs in Spain whose victims are numbered by iaon of judgment who themselves come from democratic nations at certainly no less than half a million.,&quot;We know this butchery so far has not moved the brave democratic ..iinds of our world pacifists the slightest little bit.We quite well understand this.    For behind their hypo-crytical masks usually the will to brute force lies concealed&quot;.&quot;The German people are not a warlike but a soldierly race.      They do not love war but do not fear it&quot;. Concluding Herr Hitler said: /    &quot;Party, state and army are means for a purpose and their purpose is always the nation.      I want to ask God to bless our wisdom,  to give us the courage to ao right and not to recede fr^m any danger.     Long live Germany&quot;.\\    The above summary was taken from Neuter&apos;s version.
