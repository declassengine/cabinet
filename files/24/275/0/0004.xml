THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.a -iGo P. 40(38). COPY NO_C A B I T. E T. UNITED KINGDOM-INDIA TRADE 13 GOTIATIC ITS&apos;. Memorandum by tho President of the Board of Trade.As my colleagues will be aware the negotiations for a trade agreement with India which took place from July to October last have just been resumed cn the return of the Commerce Member of the Viceroy&apos;s   Council, Sir Muhammad Zafrulla Khan, after consulting his colleagues.     He has come back armed with definite instructions as to tho kind of agreement which the Government of India are prepared to accept and the terms of this proposed agreement are such that I feel I must consult my colleagues about them at once.The history of the negotiations is shortly that they were opened on the basis that the agreement arrived at at Ottawa was satisfactory to both parties.       This was in fact the view emphatically expressed in the Legislative Assembly by the representatives of the Government of India when the denunciation of the agreement was being considered.     We desired some extension of the preferences which we enjoyed, particularly of the preference upon cotton goods which we received under the Indian Tariff Board procedure though not under the Ottawa Agreement. On the other side, we were prepared to consider concessions on certain small points desired by the Government of India, and we were prepared to sacrifice preferences on a certain amount of traue in order to meet the wishes of the Indian Legislature that they should be in a position with which to bargain with foreign countries.      Towards the end of last year&apos;s discussions it became clear that the idea of the Government of India as regards the amount of preferences which we were to be called upon to sacrifice was far larger than anything we had contemplated.      The official delegate had with him, in addition to his official advisers, certain non-official advisers representing industry and
agriculture in India.      Their view was that we should he called \upon to sacrifice practically the whole of our preferences,something like 1^ crores out of 18 crores, and that in returnwe should he given some undefined concession on cotton goods.It had been assumed that the Government of India would iiot he prepared to support these extreme proposals, hut it became clearthat in fact they were not prepared seriously to oppose them.At that stage I come to the conclusion that the only wayout of the difficulty was to place before the Indian delegatean offer which should be something like our last word so far aspurely commercial agreement was concerned.      My suggestion wason the following lines:-(a)    Cotton Piece Goods.      India to offer a duty of 15%on all United Kingdom cotton piece goods,    the duty to he reduced by successive amounts of 2^% should imports fall below&quot; 6^0 of India*s* total&quot; consumption (including handloom) and to be increased if it rose above 12^% (this figure subject to discussion).      Corresponding concessions to be given on rayon.      The present duties are 20^ on cotton piece goods (25;o on prints) and 30^ on rayon piece goods.(h)    In the event of an undue increase of imports into the United Kinguom of Jute -manufactures, some provision for consultation between the two Governments for -the purpose of finding a remedy.(c) United Kingdom to retain freedom to abolish or modifyduties on foreign wheat and rice and in certain circumstances to put a duty on Empire sine.(d) Whereas under the Ottawa Agreement United kingdom trade in 1935-36 to the value of some 18 crores enjoyed preferences (out of a total United Kingdom trade in India of 51 crores) the United Kingdom would be prepared to forego preferences on goods the imports of which amounted in 1935-36 to   -1-g- crores (l crore =  750,000).      The preferences on hardware and the non-ferrous metals, which India desired to abolish would however remain.      (United Kingdom not to accord any new preferences or to meet in other ways other Indian desiderata outside the existing agreement).(e) A formula to he found to meet the Indian request withregard to increasing imports of Indian raw cotton.Sir Muhammad Zafrulla Khan returned to India to discuss these terms with his colleagues.      On the 17th February, I saw him again and received his reply.     Leaving out of account loss* India in this context means India proper, exluding Burma.
important matters, the answer of the Government of India is that they are not prepared to accept a sacrifice of our preferences on trade less than 9 crores in value out of a total of 18 crores enjoying preferences in India.      (I should explain that this 18 crores does not include the differential duties which in effect give us a preference on cotton goods and iron and steel. Our cotton exports in 1935-36 were worth something over 9 crores).      In addition, the Government of India require a guarantee that we shall take f million hales of Indian raw cotton per annum (that is to say to maintain our purchases at the record level which they reached last year).The only substantial benefit which we are to receive is an increased preference on cotton goods.     Agreement on this point is to be come to between Lancashire and the Indian cotton interests, but the Commerce Member holds out no hope that we shall be given a stated quantity of imports and shall receive successive reductions of duty until that quantity is actually attained.    He is prepared to suggest that a new rate of duty should be agreed between the industries as likely to produce an agreed quantum of trade for Lancashire, and that one reduction of duty shall be accorded  if the agreed figure    of quantity is not obtained as a result of the original reduction.      In view of the reports which we have received from His Majesty&apos;s Trade Commissioner in India, it seems to me very doubtful whether agreement on these lines would in fact bring any substantial benefit to our cotton industry.The suggestion is that representatives of Lancashire shall go to India to discuss terms with the Indian industry, but that first the Government of India must be   satisfied that in any agreement reached thereafter they will obtain tho sacrifices of preferences indicated above.The other substantial point on which we require satisfaction is that we shall obtain freedom to place some kind of restriction on the importation of jute goods (and possibly on carpets and leather which are of less importance) into this country.      My
colleagues will know that there is great anxiety in Dundee on this question and that a great deal of sympathy with the plight of the jute industry was apparent in the House when the question was debated on a private Members motion on 2nd February.      The Government of India on this point are willing to contemplate consultation but are not prepared to give us freedom to talee unilateral action to control imports of Indian jute goods.      The Government of India are prepared to abandon their right    to a preference on wheat, in order to enable us to reach agreement with the U.S.A., and to allow us to reduce the preference on rice, should that prove necessary.I cannot recommend the acceptance as satisfactory from a trade point of view, of an agreement on the lines suggested by the Government of India.      The terms which I communicated to the Indian representative in October seemed to me to represent a fair commercial bargain.      I should be prepared, in order to avoid the consequences of failing to reach agreement with India, to agree that we should sacrifice preferences on trade worth something between 6 and 7 crores, but even that I regard as being very difficult to justify on purely commercial grounds.In conversation I could get no indication from the Commerce Member that there was any possibility of India being satisfied with anything less than 9 crores, and this fact, coupled with the unsatisfactory nature of his offer oh cotton goods and on jii&quot;te, make it necessary for me to report the matter and ask for the views of my colleagues.The sacrifices of -i-g- crores worth of trade could be made up of a number of relatively small items in respect of which we have either a relatively small share of the trade and should not stand to lose much or on which for special reasons we might be able to maintain our position.      Special considerations arise on other items (such as rubber tyres and tubes, worth 1-5 crores) where our own people have set up a factory in India and we are likely to lose the trade very-A-
2    Ishortly in any case.     An increase beyond 4-^ crores would mean a sacrifice of more substantial trades in which, the preference is of greater value to us - for example, canned and bottled provisions, toys, stationery, certain classes of paper, electric light bulbs, aluminium sheets and circles    and - possibly most difficult of all in spite of its relatively small size - woollen fabrics.Of the ten crores worth of trade left the items which could be sacrificed with least harm in order to make a sacrifice of 9 crores would be:-1955/36 ImportsTariff from the U.K.Item                                Article. (Lakhs)22(1 )b-e         Bottled ale and beer....... 3027(8)              Lubricating oil............ 2463(18)             Iron or steel&quot; pipes and tubes. 6075(3) Motorbuses, chassis ofcommercial r.?otor vehicles etc. 5875(4) Cycles, etc................. _84Total .... 2,56-As I have said above, I cannot recommend such a sacrifice on trade ground;.-, and it would be extremely difficult to induce Parliament to endorse such an agreement.      The Parliamentary difficulties would be enhanced by the necessity of legislation to reduce the drawback   at present granted to exporters on linseed and linseed oil (to meet another Indian request) and the probable necessity of legislation to guarantee the importation of Indian raw cotton.      On the other side of the picture, all I can say is that Sir Muhammad made it clear that the Government of India were not prepared to accept an agreement on terms more favourable to the United Kingdom, and that, if no agreement is reached, the Government of India ke statutory powers toimpose special duties on United Kingdom goods - our own position being that India, would automatically become a foreign country for Customs purposes.O.P.G.S.Board of Trade.18th February, 1938. r
