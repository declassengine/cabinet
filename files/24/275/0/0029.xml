In order that the Cabinet may appreciate the proposals which I make in this paper, I must refer them briefly to the appreciations and proposals already made by the Air Staff.2,      In D.P.(P) 12K which the Cabinet considered on the Interim Report of the Llinister for Co-ordination of Defence (CP.316(37)) the Air Staff gave a full appreciation of German strength and German intentions.     They also dealt with the situation overseas.      In order to meet this position, the ..ir Staff recommended that an expansion programme (known as Scheme j) should be adopted which contained the following features:-(1)   An increase of our metropolitan strength by 30 squadrons which would bring it to a first line strength of2,331 aircraft (para. 15).(2)   An addition to the Air Forces overseas of 7 squadronsover and above those authorised under the existing programmethus increasing the programme from a first line strength of 470to a first line strength of 644- (Part II).(3)    Pour additional squadrons for trade defence, anincrease of 56 first line aircraft.  (Part III).^Circulated with CP.316(37).
additional squadrons to   he provided with their appropriate scales of reserves at the earliest possible date,  the policy at present determining the productive capacity of the industry ought to be reconsidered.4-, The Air Staff further pointed out that as an essentialcorollary to this further air expansion,  steps shouldbe taken to accelerate the existing programme of provision of ground anti-aircraft defences, and the establishment of our passive defence organisation on an adequate basis..5. This memorandum was considered by the Minister forCo-ordination of Defence in his Interim Report, and was before the Cabinet when the decisions were taken on that Interim Report a      The Cabinet decided that it would not be possible to make increases in the overseas forces..      The balance of the programme was to be further reviewed by the Minister for -Co-ordination of Defence, who made general recommendations that the full fighter programme should be implemented:    that the squadrons for trade defence should be provided;    and that there should be some increase in the bomber strength. &apos;.6.

The balance of the programme was to be further reviewed by the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence, v/ho made general recommendations that the full fighter programme should be implemented;    that the squadrons for trade defence should be provided;    and that there should be some increase in the bomber strengths &apos;.60 The estimated cost of Scheme J in the years 1937 to1941 was  650,000,0/0,      In accordance with the&apos;   recommend-ations of the Minister in C,P*316(57),    the Air Ministry eliminated from Scheme J the overseas increases proposed; reduced the bomber first line strength at home to a figure corresponding to German first line strength in 1938;      reduced the reserves and made certain other economies thus reducing the-cost  to
 607,000,000.    It was, however,  clear that even this figure exceeded the sum likely to be available,  and for this reason the Air Ministry made further reductions, the principal of which were cuts of  27,000,000 in war potential and in war reserves.    The result of this was the scheme now known as Scheme K     which was estimated to cost  567,000,000.7. In presenting Scheme K to the Minister forCo-ordination of Defence for the purpose of his final review and report,  the Air Staff gave the most recent and exact information of the strength actually  attained by the German Air Force,  and also gave the minimum additions to that strength which they were certain the Germans were in process of carrying out.    (Para,  3 of Appendix IV of CP.  24 (38)).      In  their Memorandum the Air Staff presented a revised programme for the Metropolitan Air Force.    They were  careful, however,  to point out that in submitting these proposals they were making cuts in reserves and in war potential which they did not regard as justifiable, and that their present proposals (Scheme K)    represented the best effort they could make to meet the financial situation.      Scheme K therefore provides the minimum first line strength which the Air Staff regard as necessary to meet known German intentions, but it does not,  in their opinion, provide adequate reserves or war potential.K   Reproduced as Appendix IV cf CP.  24(38).
S. The Air Staff made it clear in both their papersthat they were working to meet German intentions of which they were certain, but that beyond that there might well be a still further expansion of the German Air Force;    and that such expansion would be within German capacits?- both in men and material.9. In his report,  which the Cabinet adopted,  theMinister for Co-ordination of Defence pointed out that within the financial limit laid down of  1,570,000,000 it would be impossible to meet Scheme K.      The Minister has not yet made his final allocation between the Services, but it is clear that,  if the Cabinet adhere to their previous decision,   the plan ultimately authorised for the further expansion of the Air Force must be seriously below Scheme K.      I understand that the further cut tentatively proposed by the Minister would amount to a reduction of something like  60,000,000 on Scheme K.10.       The above, I hope, states as plainly and shortly as I can the present position.      I now submit the following proposals to the Cabinet and. in doing so I deal both with the scale of programme to be authorised and the steps which are possible to accelerate its completion.11.        I suggest that the Air Ministry should be authorised now to adopt Scheme K as their expansion programme.      I think it is necessary to give that authority, as I stated to the Cabinet, not merely in the light of recent events, but because it would be impossible for the Air Ministry to accelerate their programme in a year or eighteen months&apos; time when the review takes place unless they lay the foundation of -chat larger programme now.       Unless stations, buildings, factorj&apos; extensions and training are all put in hand
in the immediate future, it would not he possible to improvise them at a later date. It would ofcourse be possible at a later date to call a halt or effect a slowing down of the programme,12. It is most desirable that as much as possible of this programme shall be completed in the next two years. I would propose,   therefore,  that sufficient labour of the right kind should be made available to enable all important factories working on the Air Ministry programme to work double shifts, where that is possible. I must point out thatthis proposal does not simply mean increasing the personnel of factories engaged on aircraft and engines,  but it must be applied through the whole range of armament,  instruments and equipment.    Unless this be done,  the programme would get hopelessly out of balance. I cannot, in this paper, give a usefulestimate  of what this means in labour,  and of what types.        To frame a useful estimate requires a careful review of all the factories and their capacity. It has been broadly estimated that if the aircraft and engine   factories could be reinforced with appropriate labour so as to enable them all to work a double shift,  this might give an increase in aggregate output of something like one-third commencing at the end of three months.13. I explained to the Cabinet to-day that even ifthis increase is obtained in the armament industry, we should still,  and indeed increasingly,  be faced with the problem of securing skilled labour for maintenance and repair in the Air Force.      Short of offering vast increases in rates of pay,  it would, we believe, be impossible to obtain the necessary number of
skilled men to do the repair work within the Service under I voluntary recruiting.      We shall do our best to train unskilled and semi-skilled men and the young entry of secondary school hoys;    and I shall require authority to expand and increase the training establishments to take as many recruits as we can cope with.      But time does not permit this to be regarded as anything more than a partial solution. .14.       There is,  however,  a different way of dealing with the repair problem which I ask authority to arrange and put into force.      I wish to establish civilian repair shops run by the aircraft firms themselves.    It is impossible to send air-craft to these firms to repair now without seriously prejudic-ing the flow of production of new aircraft.    And the additional shift,  if such can be provided, must be turned on to -production - nothing must interfere with this flow. Provided, however, further suitable labour can be provided, it should be possible for selected aircraft firms to build extra repair shops and do the repair work in these shops. I do not wish at the present time to say definitely whether the execution of this plan would be best carried out by arranging with the firms to put up this extra accommodation under the capital clause,  if they were prepared to do so, and to do this repair work on contract;    or whether these shops had better belong to the Ministry and be run by firms on management terms;    or whether a combination of these alternatives should prove to be necessary or desirable..    I ask, however, for authority to make the necessary arrangements whereby the greater part (if not all) of the repair work can be d.one by industrial firms instead of by Service personnel in Service depots,    I regard this plan as an absolutely essential concomitant of the other proposals.
r Ministry, W. C. 2. , 12th March,  1938.for the whole of air defence,  I feel bound, in conclusion to emphasise the vital importance of the anti-aircraft gun and searchlight programme keeping, as far as possible in step with the acceleration of our defences in the air.S.
