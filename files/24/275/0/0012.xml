Memorandum by the Minister of Health.1.      As the next meeting of the Home Affairs Committee will not be held until March 7th I am,  in view of the urgency of this small but very important Bill, venturing to submit the annexed draft direct for the consideration of the Cabinet. The draft gives effect to the decision of the Cabinet (5(58), Conclusion 7)  to postpone for a period of two years the general revaluation for rating purposes of property in England and Wales which,  under Section 19 of the Rating and Valuation Aot, 1925, would otherwise take effect as from the 1st April,  1959. This decision was announced in the House of Commons on the 17th instant.2,      Clause 1(1) postpones to the 1st April,  1941, the date when the new valuation list will come into operation and provides (as at present) for five-yearly intervals.      The proviso to the Clause maintains my existing power of altering the date of a  revaluation by six months in an individual case on the application of an Assessment Committee.5.      Clause 1(2)  renders void any draft valuation list made or other proceedings taken in connection with the new valuation,  except the notices served on occupiers requiring them to make returns.      Under the proviso to the subsection the rating authority is empowered either to treat these notices as good or to issue fresh notices as they think fit;    and the proviso further removes the existing obligation of the rating
authority to take steps consequential on the return of the notices &quot;as soon as may be after the expiration of the period allowed for the delivery of the returns&quot;04,      Clause 1(2)  is drawn to deal with the special  case of these areas (the City of Oxford, the County Borough of Northampton and parts of the County of Berkshire) in whioh the last valuation list was made at an exceptionally early date and consequently the next list would, in the absence of other provision,  come into force on the 1st April,  1958a It is understood that in one at least of these areas (Berkshire) it is generally desired that there shall be a postponement until 1941s      This object will be secured by the issue of such an Order as, is  referred to in the subsection, even though the Bill does not become law till after the 1st April,  1958a      In the two towns it is at present under-stood that postponement is not desired, and accordingly the subsection would except them from the general operation of the Bill,  unless the local assessment committees decide to apply to the Minister for Orders0K.W.25th February,  1958,
