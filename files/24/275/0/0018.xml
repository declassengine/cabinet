Copy No.-        TO DE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY. pyCP. 54 (38).It is requested;-that special -ga&apos;i.e may be taken to; ensure the secrecy of this document.CABINET.PROPOSED APPROACH TO THE GERMAN GOVERNMENT.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs-.IN accordance with the Conclusions of the Cabinet at its meeting on the 2nd March, I circulate to my colleagues the despatch sent to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Berlin on the 12th February, conveying instructions to him as to the terms in which to make an approach to the German Government on matters which were discussed with him during his recent visit to London. Four telegrams amplifying these instructions in respect of Austria and the Press are also annexed.H.March 3, 1938.I,Mr. Eden to Sir N. Henderson (Berlin).(No. 164.   Secret.)Sir, Foreign Office, February 12, 1938.IN the present despatch I send you instructions as to the terms in which you are to approach the German Government on the matters which His Majesty&apos;s Ministers discussed with you during your recent visit to London. In making your communication, you should emphasise its absolutely secret character. I shall send you supplementary instructions by telegram regarding the moment at which your approach to the German Government should be made. Pending the receipt of those telegraphic instructions, you should not take any action on the present despatch.2. You should inform the German Chancellor and the German Foreign Minister that during your recent visit to London you have had discussions with His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom on all the issues arising out of the conversations held during Lord Halifax&apos;s recent visit to Germany. These issues naturally cover the contributions towards appeasement which, as the bases of a possible agreement, each country might be able to make in Europe and elsewhere.3. In order not to create misunderstanding, which might give rise to greater difficulties at a later stage, you should remind the German Government of the observations you made recently as to the importance that wrould be attached, not only by His Majesty&apos;s Government, but by other Governments, to German collaboration in appeasement. Mention should be made of Czechoslovakia and Austria as illustrative of the general principle of collaboration.4. You should refer to the question of limitation of armaments, and say that, while His Majesty&apos;s Government recognise the difficulty of making progress on this subject if treated as a general question, they have taken note of the German Chancellors references to bombing, a subject which they agree with him in regarding as of great importance. They attach still greater importance-and 9714   [16704a]
they believe the German Government do the same to a limitation of bombing aircraft. You should say that the suggestions made by Herr Hitler in the past are being carefully considered, and that His Majesty&apos;s Government themselves are making a study of the whole question. They earnestly hope that it may be possible to reach agreement on practical proposals that will command general assent.5. As regards the colonial question, you might say that you had found a real disposition to study this question carefully in all its bearings and to make progress if possible. The question, of course, wras full of difficulties, as the German Government were well aware, and, as the German Government were also aware, public opinion in this country was extremely sensitive on the subject. You could say that every aspect of the problem had &quot;been under close examination by His Majesty&apos;s Government. A solution which seemed to them to have many attractions might be found in a scheme based upon the idea of a new regime of colonial administration in a given area of Africa, roughly corresponding to the conventional zone of the Congo Basin Treaties, acceptable and applicable to all the Powers concerned on exactly equal terms. Each Power, while solely concerned for the administration of its own territories, would be invited to subscribe to certain principles designed to promote the well-being of all. Some indication of the regime might-be given, starting perhaps from the conception of the Berlin Act of 1883. For instance, there would be the question of demilitarisation; also perhaps a commission consisting of representatives of all the Powers having territory in the area covered by the new arrangements, as well as stipulations for the welfare and progress of the natives, and for freedom of trade and communications. You should endeavour to ascertain in general terms how the German Government are disposed to view this suggestion. You should not at this stage discuss what particular territories might be transferred.6. If this suggestion meets generally with a favourable reaction on the part of the German Government, fuller instructions will be sent to you later.7. I am instructing His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Paris to make a communication to the French Government in the terms shown in the following-paragraph, and you are authorised to use the same terms in acquainting your French colleague with your approach to the German Government. In both cases the absolutely secret character of the communication .is to be emphasised. You should not make this communication to your French colleague until after you have made your communication to the German Government.8. The terms of the communication to the French Government will be as follows :. As the outcome of the conversations which took place at the time of Lord Halifax&apos;s visit to Germany, His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom have been considering what steps might be taken to bring about a measure of appeasement in Europe. As the French Government are aware, His Majesty&apos;s Government have been examining the various difficulties that surround any solution of the colonial question. They think it desirable, as a first step, to learn a little more of what is in the mind of the German Government on this question, and more especially how far the German Government are prepared to go in making a concrete contribution in respect&apos; of Central Europe and disarmament. As regards the colonial question, they wish to take some soundings in Berlin with the object of finding out on what lines a solution might be possible. Instructions in this sense have been sent to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Berlin. At the present stage, no definite scheme is being put forward, and no commit-ments entered into or undertakings given. His Majesty&apos;s Government wish to take this opportunity of repeating to the French Government their assurance that they would not contemplate making any proposals that did not involve a contribution on the part of His %Majesty&apos;s Government equivalent to any contribution that might be made by the French Government. In any event, they will inform the French Government of the result, if any, of their soundings in Berlin, since they realise that very close consultation between His Majesty&apos;s Government and the French Government will be necessary before any course of action is finally settled.I am, &amp;c.ANTHONY EDEN.
Viscount Halifax to Sir N. Henderson (Berlin).(No. 55.)(Telegraphic.) Foreign Office, February 27, 1938.WHEN acting on paragraph 3 of my despatch No. 164 of 12th February you should maintain the reference to Austria by name, and reference should take following form : You should say that in our view appeasement would be dependent, among other things, on measures taken to inspire confidence in Austria and Czecho-slovakia, and to establish better relations between those countries and Germany. You should add that His Majesty&apos;s Government at present cannot estimate the effect of the recent arrangements between Germany and Austria, which must depend upon the manner in which the several undertakings of the arrangements made are implemented by the two parties to them. They are therefore at present doubtful as to the effects which these arrangements are likely to have on the situation in Central Europe, and cannot conceal from themselves that recent events have aroused apprehension in many quarters, which must inevitably render more difficult the negotiations of a general settlement.It is possible that this may produce some useful explanation from the Chancellor or a clarification of his intentions.III.Viscount Halifax to Sir N. Henderson (Berlin).(No. 60.)(Telegraphic.) Foreign Office, March 2, 1938.WHEN you see Herr Hitler you may use the information contained in my two immediately following telegrams about the British press, the British Broad-casting Corporation and the Vansittart Committee, if he reverts to complaints which have recently been made with regard to these matters. You may use as much of this information as you think fit. So far as concerns my action in regard to the press and the British Broadcasting Corporation, you should give it in strict confidence and ask that our confidence should be respected. You should make it clear that in taking this action His Majesty&apos;s Government have done all in their power and have indeed taken an unusual step in order to show their sincere desire to improve the atmosphere and to facilitate conversations with the German Government.IV.Viscount Halifax to Sir N. Henderson (Berlin).(No. 61.)(Telegraphic.) . Foreign Office, March 2, 1938.MY immediately preceding telegram.In view of German criticisms of the British press, I am proposing in a few days&apos; time to call together a press conference at the Foreign Office and address the representatives of the British press on the following lines : &quot; We live in a free country with a free press, and none of us would wish to change in any way that happy state of affairs.  Freedom implies freedom to criticise, and I would not dream of asking you to cease from exercising that right.   But it also implies responsibility, and when it conies to unguarded criticisms of other countries, especially of the heads of the State or of the Government, it may be a big national responsibility.   I presume that we are all agreed that in the present state of Europe nobody here wishes to make the situation worse by needless provocation.   Many things may be done in other countries of which we do not approve, and I have no doubt that on i   matters of importance the British press will wash to express disapproval, but 1   disapproval is a very different thing in its effects abroad from abusive criticism or pin-pricking, or from too great a readiness to accept and publish . !   rumours before their correctness has been verified.  All these things do great !   damage, not only to our reputation abroad, but seriously impede any official I   effort to remove misunderstandings and improve relations.   Some countries I/
can and do control their press by official instructions. We neither do this nor do we wish to do it, but we can control ourselves, and I merely ask you in the general interest to do what you can in any way that you feel you legitimately can to respond to this appeal, which I should not make to you if I were not acutely conscious of its importance.&quot;I am also proposing to the Prime Minister that he or I should talk on similar lines to the chairman of the Newspaper Proprietors&apos; Association, arid to make an appeal to the association to do what is possible in the press to avoid provoca-tion against Germany and Italy and to instil a greater sense of national responsibility at the present time.(R.) I would also draw your attention to a reply which the Prime Minister gave to a question in the House of Commons on the 28th February, in which, after giving an assurance that any agreement come to with Germany would not include any restriction on the freedom of the British press, he repeated what he said in the House on the 21st December, about the responsibility of the press in inter-national affairs. He went on to say : &quot; I do not think that any greater service could be rendered to the cause of peace than by the exercise of restraint and toleration by the press of all countries when dealing with foreign affairs, whether they are presenting their account of current events or commenting on policies or personalities.&quot;   (End of R.)As regards the British Broadcasting Corporation I intend to speak to Sir John Keith on similar lines, making it clear that what I am saying is not an instruction from the Government, but merely the expression of a desire on their part that the British Broadcasting Corporation should bear in mind the extreme sensitiveness both of Hitler and of Mussolini to British Broadcasting Corporation &quot; talks &quot; and presentation of news in order that difficulties on this score should be eliminated or reduced as far as possible, more especially at a time when an attempt is being made by the Government to negotiate settlements and improve relations.Viscount Halifax to Si?- N. Henderson (Berlin).(No. 62.)(Telegraphic.)   R. Foreign Office. March 2, 1938.MY immediately preceding telegram.There is also considerable misapprehension in the German press as to the functions of the Committee for the Co-ordination of British Publicity Abroad. See, for example, your telegram No. 38, Saving, of 9th February and your telegram No. 30 of 11th February. Mr. Eden had already, in his telegram No. 19 of 12th February, briefly explained the functions of that committee, but I now send you the following further material on this subject, drawn from a circular despatch which will shortly reach you :  The Committee for the Co-ordination of British Publicity Abroad, of which Sir R. Vansittart is the chairman, consists at present of representatives of the Foreign Office, Treasury, Colonial Office, General Post Office and Department of Overseas Trade and of the British Broadcasting Company, British Council and Travel Association.The aim of the committee is to ensure that the fullest and most effective use is made of the various efforts to spread a better understanding of this country and its people abroad. Its function will be to prevent overlapping by the organisations concerned in this work and; by advice and the exchange of information, to co-ordinate their activities. It is not a new Government department and will exercise no control or censorship over the British Broadcasting Company or press, nor will it.issue material to them or concern itself with details of their day-to-day work.At the present stage the committee will devote itself to a survey of the work now being doiie through the various means of publicity-newspapers, telegraph agencies, broadcasting, films, British Council and analogous bodies and tjo considering&apos; how this work can be co-ordinated, stimulated and made mor coiripiete.I:   It is in no sense an instrument of propaganda against any other country.
