IS  DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC IvlAJj]STx&apos;S  GOVERNMENT. 3RJT. COPY NO.      4jj. 69(58)CABINET.CENSUS  OF PRODUCTION ACT;_PROPOSALS FOR AMENDING LEGISLATION&apos;.Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.I desire authority to proceed with the preparation of a short Bill to amend the Census of Production Act so as to bring the provisions of that Act into line with those under the Import Duties Act,The Board of Trade obtain statistics of industrial production under powers conferred both by the Census of Production Act, 1905, and by Section 9 of the Import Duties Act, 1932, as amended by the Finance Act. 1933.      The powers under the Census of Production Arit cover a -wider field (l) because they enable  information to be obtained regarding the power equipment of industry, and (2) because  they extend to all industrial production, whereas the powers under the Import Duties Act do not cover such trades as shipbuilding, building, public utilities (railways, electricity, gas, etc.), local authorities, and the excisable  industries such as alcoholic drinks, sugar and mineral oils.      On the other hand, the powers under the Import Duties Act are  the more detailed because they enable us to obtain valuable information regarding details of output and of materials used which are not within the scope of the Census of production Act0 (a) Output.Under the Census of Production Act, the Board of Trade can only require quantitative information regarding output in the detail specified in the Import and Export List.      The value of any other class of goods can be asked for, but over a series of
years -when prices are liable to change considerably, these figures are not of much significance.     The 5oard of Trade can also ask for quantitative information on a voluntary basis, and at previous censuses they have, at the specific request of trade associations, asked for such particulars.     Experience has shown that these requests, though backed up by the trade associations, fail to yield satisfactory results.There are numerous classes of commodities which are required principally for the home trade and which, though produced on a sufficiently large scale  to justify separate enumeration in statistics of production, are not imported or exported to any appreciable extent and therefore do not appear specifically in the Import and Export List,     The restriction imposed by the Census of Production Act is not contained in the Import Duties Act, and experience has shown that in the trades covered by that Act the use of the additional powers has provided much valuable information and has not lod to complaints being made by manufacturers. (b) Materials and, fuel used.Under the Census  of Production Act, only the aggregate cost of all materials and fuel used can be  required to be stated, and the object of requiring this one figure was solely to enable the net output of industry to he ascertained.      The Macmillan Committee on Finance and Industry recommended that detailed information on tais subject should be required, stating that lack of such information makes many of the most important industrial statistics relating to the dependence of one industry upon another extremely chaotic.      The opportunity afforded by the pa&amp;sing of the Import Duties Act was  taken to implement the    ^ recommendation of the Macmillan Committee on this subject so far as the trades covered by the Import Duties Act Inquiries were
concerned,,      Tha information collected in accordance with this added cower has heen shown to be extremely valuable, and partly at the request of the Import Duties Advisory Committee the powers have heen used to an increasing extent at each successive Import Duties Act Inquiry.At the 1940 Census of Production it is proposed, to obtain information regarding the power equipment of industry.    If the Census of Production Act is not amended before  then,  it will be necessary to istue two forms, one under the Censut of Production Act and the other under the Import Duties Act, to firms liable to make returns under both Acts and this procedure would obviously lead to friction and expense.      Trade  interests now seem to appreciate the value of the information obtained as a result of these Inquiries, and it is unlikely that they would raise opposition to the proposed amendments, (c) A consequential amendment will be needed to enable the Import Duties Advisory Committee to have access  to individual returns  in respect of the trades with which they are concerned in the same manner as if the returns had been obtained under the Import Duties Act.I should add that I do not propose to take powers to obtain returns of salaries and wages paid.     Such information would be valuable;    it is collected in many countries; and power to obtain it was recommended by the Conference of British Commonwealth Statisticians held at Ottawa in 1935.      I have ascertained, However, that such a proposal would be strongly opposed by the National Confederation of Employers.     Their arguments may not be convincing, but I am not satisfied that the value of the infomation obtained would be  commensurate with the difficulty of obtaining it, and I have not therefore included this power in my proposals.     Should any other point
become controversial - I have no reason at present to think those I have  included are likely to he controversial - I should propose to consult the Cabinet expressly before the draft Bill goes before the Home Affairs Committee.The Bill, authority for the  drafting of which is now desired, is included among the tentative list of Bills for the 1938-39 Parliamentary session in the report of the Committee of Home Affairs 11 (37), as legislation is required before notice of the taking of a Gensus of Production for 1940 is given at the end of 1939.0.F..G.3 .Board of Trade ,17th March,  1938.
