THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJE8TYJS GOVERNMENT. SECRET.COPY NO.IC.P.42  (38).CABINET.NEW CONSTRUCTION PROGRAMME. 1938. MEMORANDUM BY THE FIRST LORD OP THE ADMIRALTY.1.     At the meeting of the Cabinet on February 16th it was suggested that the consideration of the Naval Construction programme should be postponed in view of the decision that had been reached with regard to the reportby the Minister for Co-Ordination of Defence, CP. 24 (38). I pointed out that the consideration of that paper must occupy many weeks and that it was most important that there should be a decision concerning Naval Construction in time to enable an announcement to be made before the debate on defence which is to take place at the beginning of March. It was therefore agreed that I should consult with the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Minister for Co-Ordination of Defence with a view to arriving if possible at an agreed programme.2.     We met on February 17th when the Chancellor referred me to the original figures in the D.R.C.  report (D.R.C.37, Appendix No.l to Schedule I) where the figure given for the 1938 New Programme was    36,367,500. Assuming the same programme, the cost would now be  44,370,000,  the increase being due to rise in prices and modifications of design.      The figure put forward in the paper I submitted to the Cabinet last week (CP. 29 (38)) was  70,000,000.This/
2.This was based on the programmes of the two previous years and on the assumption that it was still the policy of the Government to accelerate preparations for war.3. It is, I submit, at present too early tosay how far these preparations will be affected by Sir Thomas    inskip&apos;s recent report.      I have however taken note of the opinion expressed in paragraph 41 to the effect that &quot;the present year is likely to be of critical importance&quot; and that &quot;it is necessary that no action on our part during these months should imply,  or should seem to imply, weakening in our resolve to press forward with our defence programmes resolutely by all practicable means.      The effect on the whole international situation of our decisions in this sphere may well have an incalculable effect On the course of events in 1936.&quot;     Sharing that opinion as I do I wish to press most strongly for the adoption of the original programme put forward by&apos; the Admiralty.      This year defence estimates are likely to incur closer inspection and more rigorous criticism than at any previous period.      At last the country,  including the Opposition,  is fully alive to the dangers of the international situation and is united in support of rearmament.      The easiest criterion to apply to this year&apos;s programme is the standard of last year.     Anything that seems to denote a falling away from that standard or a slowing
down of it will &quot;be pounced upon as evidence that the assurances which have &quot;been so often given and so recently repeated that all goes well with our rearmament programme are no longer correct.    It will be asked whether anything has occurred in the world of foreign affairs to justify us in doing less than we did a year.030.    The answer can only be that the opposite is the case.4.      These estimates will be equally closely scrutinised by Foreign Powers.    It has been said with truth that British reaxniament has done much to restore confidence in Surope.    That confidence will certainly be shaken by any indication that our efforts in this direction are less vigorous than they were.5-.      The next eighteen months form from a naval standpoint the most anxious period that we have to faee, with three of our capital ships reconditioning and none of our new construction complete.    It is also the period during which least reliance can be placed upon naval assistance from Prance,  since her two modern battleships are not expected to be completed until 1940 whereas those of Italy are due for Completion this year, as also are Germany&apos;s two 26,000 ton battle cruisers.    Germany is also expected to complete her first two 35,000 ton battleships in 1939.    I suggest that during the dangerous period it is most important to present a
bold front and to prevent the growth of suspicion that our resources begin to be exhausted.6.      I give below under A the sort of programme of construction to which we should be reduced if we were limited to the figure of  36,000,000, and beside it for purposes of comparison the 1937 programme.      The former is a programme which I do not think the Government could,  at this juncture,  lay-before the House of Commons.7,      In order to assist the Cabinet in finding a solution of the problem I submit yet another alternative.      The figures under B.  represent a saving on the original programme of  22,000,000 or 31;S of the total.      I think it must be agreed that in these figures a very sincere effort has been made to meet the wishes of the Chancellor.      It is a programme which represents expenditure of  21,000,000 less than that put forward last year. It is however a programme that can be defended and it is one that the Board of Admiralty would accept on the understanding that the items which have been dropped from the previous programme have been only deferred and not abandoned.      It should however be made plain that if this programme is adopted it will mean that for the first time since the task of rearmament was undertaken we are deliberately diminishing the speed of our preparations and are postponing work which can be undertaken immediately and which our professional advisers consider vital to the safety of the Empire.(Intd.)
