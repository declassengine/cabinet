COPY NO.il,0^745(58). -CABINET.UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE STATUTORY COMMITTEE.ANNUAL REPORT UPON THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE ^EMPLOYMENT FUNDAT 31ST DECEMBER, 1937.MEMORANDUM BY THE MINISTER OF LABOUR.1.     The Unemployment Insurance Statutory Committee have presented their Annual Report upon the financial condition of the General Account of the Unemployment Fund on 31st December, 1937, together with a similar report in respect of the Agricultural Account of the Fund.     A proof copy of the two reports is annexed.2.     The General Account of the Fund.     The balance in the General Account was  60,379,000, of which  52,963,000 is required, upon a prudent view, to meet prospective expenditure;    thus, there is a non-recurrent surplus of  7,416,000 which is available for disposal.     Translated into the terms of an annual surplus upon the principle adopted by the Committee in their earlier reports, and allowing for interest, there is an annual surplus of about  1,000,000 a year under this head.     This surplus will thus be used up over the next eight years, namely, over the assumed average period of a trade cycle.3.     The Committee propose to make use of the powers recently conferred by the Unemployment Insurance Act according to which the balances of the Fund may be used in whole or in part to repay funded debt and so reduce proportionately the annual debt charge.     They have recommended that  20,000,000 out of the balance of reserves should be applied to reduction of the Debt, with a consequential saving upon the annual debt charge which, after allowing for loss of interest, will increase the immediate resources of the Fund by  500,000 a year.     This sum of  20,000,000 is the largest which the Committee think can be repaid out of the balance without running an unjustifiable risk,    even on an optimistic view, of having to re-borrow in the next eight years.
4.     The position therefore will he that there is an annual sum of  1,500,000 available for disposal.5.     By a majority of 5 to 2 - the Chairman, Sir William Beveridge, beingamong the majority - the Committee recommend:-(l) that the allowance of &quot;additional days&quot; to insured contributors with good industrial records during the last five years, should be increased.     At present a contributor is allowed three additional days of benefit for every five contributions paid during the past five years, less one day for every eight days of benefit drawn during that period.     The change recommended by the Committee is that the number of additional days allowed should be increased by subtracting one additional day for every ten days in place of every eight days of benefit already drawn;(2) that the weekly rate of benefit paid in respect of an adult dependant - usually the applicant&apos;s wife - should be increased from 9/- to 10/- a week.The Committee estimate that the first of these changes will cost about 500,000 a year and the second about  1,000,000 a year.6.     Sir Amos Ayre and Captain C.C. Craig in a Minority Report agree as to the amount of the disposable surplus in the General Account, but recommend that it should be used to reduce the rates of contribution in each of the next two years.     They concur in all the other recommendations in the two Reports.7.     The Agricultural Account of the Fund.     The Committee report that there was a balance in the Agricultural Account at 31st December 1937 of some  1,825,000 and that ine income of the Agricultural Account is and is likely to continue to be more than reasonably sufficient to discharge its liabilities. They make the following recommendations as to changes required to make the Fund in respect of its Agricultural Account not more than reasonably sufficient -(a) That the waiting time of six days for which no benefit is payable at the beginning of a period of unemployment should be reduced to three days. A similar change was made in the General scheme of Unemployment Insurance a year ago.2.\\ .......
(b) That the rates of contributions by each party to the scheme should be reduced by -gd. in respect   of contributors aged IS and upwards. Thus, the contribution for an adult man will become 4d. in place of 4^-d.. and for an adult woman 3gd. in place of 40.(c) That the weekly rate of Agricultural benefit in the case of young men between the ages of 18 and 21 should be 12/- in place of 10/60.     This proposal is made in view of the fact that while adult women and young men between IS and 21 each contribute at the same rate, the rate of benefit is at present 12/60. for a woman and 10/6d. for a young man.(d) That the condition that 10 fresh contributions must have been paiO since the exhaustion of benefit in a benefit year should apply only where a claimant exhausted benefit through drawing 300 days of benefit in a benefit year and not where benefit has been exhausted under the rules proportioning benefit to unexhausted contributions.     The present rule produces some awkward anomalies which are described in jiara. 17 of the Agricultural Report.The Committee estimate that their   recommendations will increase the expenditure of the Fund on the Agricultural Account by approximately  42,500 a year and will decrease the income by approximately  180,000 a year. 8.     I think that we should adopt the recommendations of the majority of the Committee in respect of the General Account and of the full Committee in respect of the Agricultural Account of the Unemployment Fund.     It would in my view be most unwise to adopt the recommendations of the Minority as to the use of the surplus in the General Account to reduce rates of contribution. Upon the assumptions as to the course of trade during the next eight years to which the Minority have assented, that course would create the necessity within a very few years of raising contributions or reducing benefits.     We should then be open to the charge that in the light of ample warning we had produced a situation in which industry was faced with fresh buidens - or the workpeople with reduced benefits - at the time at which such changes were least tolerable.     Moreover I do not believe that the very limited reduction of contributions which is all that would be possible would be felt to conf er any sensible advantage on employers or workpeople.     On the other hand I
feel that the improvement in the conditions regarding additional days of benefit and the increase in the rate of benefit for adult dependants, as recommended by the majority,would be regarded as a reasonable and v/elcome use of the surplus.9.     With regard to the Agricultural Account the reduction of the waiting days is clearly desirable in order to bring the Agricultural Scheme into line with the General Scheme and it is a change which has been urged from many sides. The reduction in the rates of contribution will be welcomed as reasonable in view of the substantial balance of the Agricultural Account.   The other two proposed changes are small and useful.10.   Subject to the chancellors concurrence, I propose to adopt the recommendations as indicated above and to take the necessary action for giving effect to them by affirmative Resolutions in both Houses.(Int.)

UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE STATUTORY COMMITTEEFifth Report on the Financial Condition of the Unemployment Fund (General Account). as at 31st December, 1937To the Rt. Hon. Ernest Brown, M.C., M.P., Minister of Labour.Sir,By Section 59 (1) of the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1935, we are required to make a report on the financial condition of the Unemployment Fund at the end of each calendar year. By Section 8 (1) of the Unemployment Insurance (Agriculture) Act, 1936, we are required to exercise this function of reporting on the financial condition of the Unemployment Fund separately with regard to the General and the Agricultural Accounts of the Fund. We submit below a report with regard to the General Account of the Unemployment Fund, with a recommendation for the application of a surplus. We make a recommendation also under Section 3 of the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1938, for the application of moneys standing to the credit of the General Account of the Fund towards the discharge of part of the debt of the Fund. We are reporting separately with regard to the Agricultural Account.1. We begin by presenting in Appendix A a formal account of the working of the Fund in the calendar year 1937, with corre-sponding figures for 1936 in parallel columns for comparison. The first portion of this Appendix deals with the General Account. The account has been prepared for us by the Accountant General for the Ministry of Labour. It is not an audited account, but it is in the same form as the accounts of the Fund which are presented to Parliament after audit, for the financial year ending on 31st March.2. The receipts for the calendar year were  64,966,913, of which all but  683,225 represented insurance contributions by employers, employed persons, and the State. The other receipts included a net sum of  674,105 as income from investments, after allowing for loss on redemption of certain securities. The expenditure was  43,565,187, made up of  33,160,000 for unemployment benefit,  4,870,000 for administration,  5,000,000 for debt service, and  535.187 for minor items. Income during 1937 exceeded expenditure accordingly by  21,401,726, making, with the balance of  38,977,280 carried forward at 31st December, 1936, a net balance at 31st December, 1937. of  60,379,006.3. As compared with 1936, contributions from employers and employed persons show a decline of  429,272; growth of the insured population and decline of unemployment offset almost completely the much larger loss of income that would otherwise have followed from the lowering of contribution rates, which was effective only for six months of 1936 and for the whole of 1937.
Contributions from the Defence Departments in respect .of men discharged from H.M. Forces show a marked decline, due to reduction in the capitation rate payable; the men discharged have shared in the general improvement of employment. The Exchequer contribution, being proportionate to contributions from other sources, also shows a moderate decline. On the other hand income from investments has risen materially, from  226,251 to  674,105; the rise represents an increase both of the balance invested and of the rate of interest which it has proved possible to obtain. Taking all items together, the income of  64,966,913 in 1937 shows a decline of  740,325 as compared with the income of  65,707,238 recorded in 1936.4. On the side of expenditure, decline of unemployment has led to a reduction in the expenditure on benefit of  4,850,000. The rise of  120,000 in the cost of administration is due to.a number of small increases in respect of the pay and conditions of certain grades of staff,, of the percentage charge for super-annuation, of salaries through the operation of normal incre-ments, and of other matters. There is a decrease of  13,897 in the minor item of refund of contributions paid in error and an increase of  130,133 in the item of contributions to courses of instruction. The first of these items depends on the claims made by employers and employed persons; the second depends, as regards juveniles, on the rate of the approved expenditure by Local Education Authorities, and, as regards adults, on the programme of training of the Ministry of Labour. Taking all items together, the expenditure of  43,565,187 in 1937 shows a decline of  4,614,581 as compared with the expenditure of  48,179,768 in 1936.5. The  5,000,000 for debt service paid in two half-yearly instalments of  2,500,000 each at 31st March, and 30th September, 1937, included  3,381,347 as interest, and  1,618,653 as repayment of capital. The debt at the end of September, 1937, stood at  103,122,381, and interest in the current half year is accruing at an average rate of 3 -15 per cent. From October, 1938, onwards the rate of interest on the whole debt will be 3^ per cent.6. As regards investments, the policy was continued of investing the growing balance of the Fund in short term securities, this policy being governed by the conclusion that the securities would need to be realised to meet deficiencies in the present trade cycle. At the end of 1936, over  28,000,000, or the greater part of the balance of the Fund, was invested in 1 per cent. Treasury Bonds. Weekly surpluses since that time have been invested mainly in 4^ per cent. Conversion Stock 1940-44 and latterly in 5 per cent. Conversion Stock 1944-64. The position on 31st December, 1937, in relation to investments is shown at the foot of the Statement of Account (Appendix A). The net rate of interest that was being received on these invest-ments, after allowing for loss or profit on redemption, was about s per cent.48086 -A- *
Working and Prospects of Unemployment Fund. General Account.7. We supplement the formal account of the Unemployment Fund for the calendar year 1937, by a table in Appendix B showing the general course of unemployment and the financial working of the unemployment insurance scheme, month by month from November, 1931, to December, 1937. The figures of income and expenditure are statistical approximations only, but are sufficient as a general guide to the operation of the scheme.8. In presenting this table we call attention to the change made by the Ministry of Labour in September, 1937, in the method of counting the unemployed. The effect of the change was to reduce the number of insured persons counted as unemployed in that month by about 44,000, representing between 0-3 and- 0-4 per cent, of unemployment. But the proportionate change is different for different industries and may not be the same at different general levels of unemployment. The Ministry of Labour, accordingly, propose to make no attempt to translate &quot; old count &quot; into &quot; new count &quot; figures, but to print the &quot; new count &quot; percentages in future, leaving a break at September, 1937. All our former reports have been based on the &quot; old count &quot;; as we shall have frequent occasion to refer to them, and as the &quot; old count &quot; persists for most of the year under review, we use &quot; old count &quot; figures for most purposes in this Report, but we print them in italics. &quot; New count &quot; percentages, where they occur, are printed in romantype. ,9. Each of the last two financial reports on the General Scheme (our Third and Fourth Reports) was based on a state-ment submitted to us in 1935 by the Committee on Economic Information of the Economic Advisory Council. This state-ment gave as the most probable mean level of unemployment for the next complete trade cycle, beginning with the year 1936, an unemployment percentage of i6\ or 16J per cent. Adopting in our Third Report the higher of these two percentages as a working hypothesis of the mean unemployment to be provided for, we made assumptions as to the rate of unemployment in each year which would yield a mean of iof per cent, over the eight years 1936-43. On these assumptions, we expected during 1936 and 1937 to be in a relatively favourable period of the trade cycle, and, even with the reduction of contributions which we then proposed, to make large additions to the balance of  21,450,000 which we carried forward at the end of 1935; we hoped to make a further small addition during 1938. Our expectations for these three years are set out in tabular form below.

Tne &apos; Actual&apos; (A) percentage ranking for benefit in 1937 &apos;s affected by this extension.
10. As will be seen, these original expectations lead to the accumulation by the end of 1937 of a balance of  37,597,000, growing to  40,730,000 by the end of 1938. But, thereafter, if the working hypothesis adopted by us from the Committee on Economic Information proved to be correct, the expenditure of the Unemployment Fund for several years: would exceed the income, and the whole i of &quot;the accumulated balance shown in the table would be absorbed in meeting deficiencies. That is to say, out of any balance held by us at the end of 1937,  37,597,000 must be regarded as a reserve for depression, and not as a disposable, surplus.11. When, a year ago, we came to prepare our Fourth Report, the unemployment experience -of 1936 had been materially better than our expectation as set out above: in place of an unemployment rate of-14 -5 with 4.6-0 per cent, ranking for benefit, we had-experienced at rate of 72-9 with 4.6-2 per cent, ranking. It-was clear,-also, that the experience of 1937 was likely to prove materially better than our original expecta-tion as set out in the table above. Taking account-of a realised gain of  6,700,000 above expectations -in. 1936, and of  9,800,000 as a safe figure: for the further-gain that we might hope to make in -1937, we declared in our Fourth Report a disposable surplus EDfi  16,500,000. We recommended that this sum, with such-interest as it earned, should be used to meet, during the eight; years .1937-44, the cost:of-the improve-ments of benefits; which we.proposed namely ithe-reduction of the waiting period to three days in place of six, andthe lengthen-ing of the period for- which benefit can be drawn, by the more liberal grant of additional days under Section gi of the Unem-ployment Insurance &quot;Act of -1935. Allowing for the expenditure already incurred on - these improvements during 1937 and for interest, we estimate::that out of &quot;the balance held :by us at the end of 1937  15,366,000 must be -regarded as hypothecated to meet the cost of- these improvements during the; seven years 1938-44. Adding this to the sum of  37,597,000 named in the preceding paragraph,, we reach a total of  52,963,000 ear-marked to meet losses in ;the ^depression for which we-must provide, and the cost of additional benefits already approved. Unless at the end of 1937 our balance exceeds Ithat total, we have no surplus for disposal.12. The actual experience of 1937 has/been ibetter, not only than our original expectation as set out-above, but than the revised expectation on;which in our last report 1 we declared our disposable surplus.. In place of an unemployment rate of J2-o with 4$-o per cent? ranking for-benefit, the actual rate has been 10-j with 48-4 per cent, ranking; part, but not the whole, of this higher ranking proportion is due to the improvements of benefit recommended in our Fourth Report.   The actual balance
of the general Account of the Unemployment Fund at the end of 1937 is  60,379,000. This exceeds by  7,416,000 the balance of  52,963,000 which, as stated above, we require to have in hand by the end of 1937.13. Till recently there was reason to hope that the balance at the end of 1937 would be materially greater than it has proved to be. In January, 1937, unemployment showed less than the normal seasonal increase, and it fell rapidly thereafter, to below 10 per cent, in each of the months June to September. But in the last quarter of the year unemployment has changed its course, and has shown a marked increase from 9-5 (g-8) in September to 11-8 (12-2) in December. The rise in the per-centage unemployed has been accompanied by a rise in the proportion of unemployment ranking for benefit. The bulk of the recent additions to those unemployed have been men and women with sufficient previous employment to qualify them for benefit, as distinct from assistance. Of the 258,573 increase of insured unemployed between October and December, 1937, 230,642, or nearly go per cent., were claimants for benefit. The rise in the proportion ranking for benefit with the rise in the percentage of unemployment is in accord with expectation; as we pointed out in our First Financial Report (pp. 8 and 9), the Unemployment Fund feels a first recession of employment with exceptional severity, as it benefits exceptionally by a recovery.14. But the rise of the unemployment percentage itself is not in accord with expectation, in respect either of the extent of the rise or of the time at which it has come. The rise-of the unem-ployment percentage from g-8 to 12-2, that is to say by 2-4, from September to December, 1937, is materially greater than has been recorded in the las? quarter of any year since 1921 with the single exception of 1930; in that year unemployment in the last quarter rose from 17-3 to ig-6 per cent., that is to say by 2-5. In September, 1929, just before the beginning of the last depression, unemployment stood at the same point as in Sep-tember, 1937 (g-8) ; it then began to rise, as it has done on this occasion, but far less rapidly, reaching io-g only by December, 1929, as compared with 12-2 in December, 1937, and 12-3 in. January, 1930, as.compared with 13-3 in the January just ended.15. The sudden change in the course of unemployment has reduced materially the surplus above original expectations which till recently we hoped to be able to declare at the end of 1937. This, however, is the least of its effects. More important is its bearing on our judgment of the prospects for 1938 and thereafter. The events of the last three months make our task this year of reporting on the financial position of the Unem-ployment Fund a task of peculiar difficulty.48086 a 4
i&quot;6: When we were preparing our report last year, we had the&apos;&quot; benefitr of &quot;a discussion with Mr. H. D. Henderson,&apos;who came&quot;&apos; before us as the representative of the Committee on-Economic&quot; Information  of the Economic Advisory. &quot;Council.   On that occasion,- -in- November, 11936,. Mr. Henderson suggested the following, conclusions: -(fl)that in view of-the defence programme,-there is r practically no prospect of an-, appreciable recession of em-ployment from the present, level for 1937 and for some time.thereafter. .(6) That on. the-completion of the intensive phase of the defence-programme-and-in the-normal course of the trade--cycle we should be prepared for fa relatively severe reces-sion, but that nothing, has. happened to justify an assump-tion-that. the.level-.6f.unemployment then reached will ber either: materially higher or materially lower than that assumed-in-the original estimate of i6-\ to r6f per.cent. -17. -The-first paragraph of this statement has.been justified in substaneeby events up-to the present time.   In November,, 1936, -when -the-statement- was made,&apos; the unemployment, percentage: was 11.-8. - During f he rfirst part of 1937 this rate of unemploy-ment was-^not only, maintained but improved upon;.; this possibility we always assumed to be implicit in Mr.- Henderson!s- -forecast.--  The - recession of the-last three months has ; been . sufficient to make unemployment in December, 1937, 0-4. above theMevel1 of &quot;November, 1936:   But the practical inference that wef drew,: that we might Count on adding at least  ib;ooo,ooo to our balance in 1937, &quot;has been amply justified.l8t Ldokihg beyond the present time, the view is changed. Unemployment&apos;at the end of 1937 was already above the level of November; 1936. It is anything but certain to-day that there will be.no appreciable recession of employment from that level &quot; for some time &apos;:&apos; after the end of 1937. The only question ndw:is how great the immediate recession will be. Are1 we to suppose that.&quot; the normal course of the trade cycle &quot; is already operating to&apos; bring &apos;.&apos; a relatively severe recession &quot; into early prospect?&quot; Are we to1 expect, on the other hand, that the decline of employment now in progress will be arrested befofeanythihg that &apos;can&apos; fairly be called depression is reached ?19. If &quot; the normal course of the trade cycle &quot; is to be judged from experience&apos;in the past there are some reasons for expecting that the&apos;-movement of employment for several years will now be steadily downward. In the fifty odd years before the wanfoiv whi h&apos; Trade&quot;union returns of unemployment are available there are! seven movements of recovery from cyclical depression-^-&apos; aftef-1862, ;i868, 1879,1886, 1894, 1904, 1909: In&quot;only:one of these: seven from 1894 to 1899-did) recovery proceed for more than four years.   T937 is already: the ififth year of recovery/that
is to,say of-declining unemployment after the depression which culminated:in 1932., It is possible, of course, that,.changes of economic structure since the, war have increased,,the normal length of the trade, cycle; in the recovery from ,the., depression .of 1921-2 unemployment,, apart, from the. dispute year 1926, ^fluctuated about io-o per cent, from.1924^0 1929. , But con-ditions then were in many ways abnormal., Unless it could be .assumed that for some reason the,upward and downward move-,ments of unemployment were likely to last longer than before the war, there was reason to look for a downward movement of employment in 1.937; Dut for the defence programme, the turn might have been expected,in the early part, of 1937 rather than at its end. Moreover, though, as stated by the London and Cambridge Economic Service in the Bulletin which we quote below (para. 21) some of the features that we should expect to iherald a depression do not appear to be present, others do. Studies made by. this Service and by the. Harvard Economic Service have, shown decline in the price of industrial stocks as one of the earliest signs of coming depression. Both in Britain and in America these prices have been falling persistently since the;early months of 1937.20. On the other hand, study of the past yields examples both of&apos;decline so gradual that depression was not reached for seven years after the downward turn began (as. from 1872 to 1879) and of a.decline begun but arrested for a year (as recently as 1929 as; well as on earlier occasions). And;Mr. Henderson, who icame-before us; again, early in December-last,, asrepresen-tative of the Committee on Economic Information,..- leaned definitely tothis view of the immediate prospects. What he said torus on, behalf of the. Committee may be summarised as follows:  On the one hand it was practically certain that the rate of unemployment would be higher in 1938 than in 1937. There were clear-signs of a recession of activity in a number of different directions, such as building, motor-ear produc-tion, and certain export industries.: For the time being, moreover, there was some tendency on the part of manu-facturers and traders to allow their stocks of materials to run down.   On-the other hand, in - the opinion of the Committee on Economic Information, the probabilities were : ; against.the recession becoming a depression in 1938 or even . in, 1939.   For a considerable time to come, work on the - -defence programme would undergo a steady expansion;,and it was: probable that this would suffice to maintain a gener-; tally j satisfactory. condition&apos; of industrial activity.&quot; Unem-. ployment must be expected to increase materially if activity in important industries such as house-building and textiles ,;de.clined^ since it was;;unlikely that, all the workpeople thus
iodisplaced would be readily absorbed elsewhere, however strong demand in the aggregate might be, and it must be remembered that the unemployment figures of 1937 repre-sented conditions of a widespread shortage of labour. But, so long as the defence programme was in an intensive phase, it was unlikely that the general conditions would be those of depression. Indeed it was possible that some of the causes of the recession now in progress might prove ephemeral and that trade and employment might take another turn for the better during the course of 1938. Thus on an optimistic view it was conceivable, though not very likely, that 1939 might on the average prove a better year than 1938. But the prospect remained of a fairly severe depression after the defence programme had passed its peak and the rates of unemployment to be expected would be raised by the structural unemployment resulting from the specialised character of the defence programme.21. The view of the Committee on Economic Information that no severe depression was imminent appeared to be based partly on the existence of the defence programme as a counteracting force and partly on the belief that the general financial conditions were not such as normally accompanied the onset of depression. Practically the same view is expressed in the December Bulletin of the London and Cambridge Economic Service.&quot; The existing slackening (of business activity) is not attributable to weakness on the side of finance since money is cheap and plentiful or in the main structure of industry as was the case in 1929. . . . Exports to the countries that produce primary goods should be satisfactory since they have considerable purchasing power, the re-armament programme will make further demands on industry and work that has been postponed owing to the deamess or scarcity of materials can be put in hand. Much further decline in the United States would, however, have grave repercussions here as would also an outburst of exaggerated pessimism. Apart from these contingencies there is reason to hold that the existing setback although likely to lead to further unemployment in the near future, need not develop into either a deep or lasting depression.&quot;22. It must be remembered that this statement, like that of Mr. Henderson, was made before the unfavourable returns of unemployment in December were obtained. It is not possible to exclude from consideration the possibility that industrial activity may continue to decline steadily-and at a fairly rapid pace. And since there is that possibility, there can be no ques-tion to-day of doing as we did last year and of treating as already disposable any surplus that is not already in hand. But the surplus of  7,416,000 mentioned in para. 12 is in hand, after
s ittprmdding  37,597,000 for,depression. The, chance that unem-ployment in 1938 will increase so rapidly, and. that the propor-tion of it,ranking; for benefit will; be so high, as to prevent us from making the further gain of about  3,000,000: that; our financial plans require is not great. In view of the provision already)made for depression and of the advice given to us on behalf of; the Committee ;on Economic Information, we feel justified in, regarding the achieved surplus - of  7,416,000, at 31st December, 1937, as disposable for improvement of benefits or lowering of contributions.23: It: remains; tof consider, how this single sum of  7,416,000 should be translated into an annual sum for allocation to benefits on contributions. Last-year we spread the surplus disposable at the end; of 1936 over the eight years 1937-44. Allowing for interest and delay in bringing, changes into force we translated a;single sum of  16,500,000 into an annual sum of  2,250,000. Should we follow that precedent to-day and spread our single sum again over eight: years? Should we choose a longer period making; the annual.equivalent less? Or should we, under the new powers conferred by the Unemployment Insurance -Act, 1938, devote the surplus to payment of debt; securing thereby a reductionof the debt charge? On the first of these alternatives ^that is to say on the precedent of last year, with similar adjust-ment for interest and delayed action the  7,416,000 translates into  1,000,000 a.year. On the second alternative, with say a ten-year in place of an eight-year period, it becomes  8oo;ooo a year. On the last alternative it becomes about  370,000 a year. The choice between these and other alternatives depends om consideration of their, effect on the balancing point of the Fund and the relation of this balancing point to the mean level about which we should expect unemployment to fluctuate in the future.24. Any improvement of benefits or reduction of contributions not off-set by corresponding saving in expenditure lowers the balancing point of the Unemployment Fund, i.e., the rate of unemployment at which income and expenditure balance, one another. To devote a surplus to payment of debt, under our new powers, and to limit changes of benefit or contribution to the,amount saved thereby, on the annual debt charge does not affect the:balancing point of the Fund; additional expenditure in one direction is ; covered by permanent saving in another direction. To propose a change of benefits or contributions which involves distributing, our surplus over a relatively short period of-years means assuming that by the time the surplus is exhausted, i.e., after the end of the period, the mean rate of unemployment will have fallen to the new balancing point.25. Our first improvement of benefits, increasing in 1935 the rate of the dependent children&apos;s benefit from 2s. to 3s., lowered
the balancing point of the Fund from 18 -1 to 17-7 and was made on the assumption of a mean rate of unemployment not above the new balancing point.   Reduction of contributions by id. in 1936 lowered the balancing point of the Fund from 17-7 to 16-o or less.   On our working hypothesis that the actual unemploy-ment from 1936 to 1943 would be z6f per cent., this meant that in those eight years as a whole the expenditure of the Fund would exceed its income and that by the end of those eight years the balance of the Fund would be exhausted.   It meant, as a consequence, that the Unemployment Fund would become insolvent unless after 1943 the rate of unemployment fell to 16 per cent, or less.   The lengthening of the benefit period at both ends which followed upon our last Report of February, 1937, lowered the balancing point of the Fund to 15-4.   It involved therefore, the assumption that after 1944, when the capital sum of  16,500,000 set aside to provide for these improvements would be exhausted, the rate of unemployment would not be more than 15-4 per cent.   If now, following the precedent of last year, we distribute the realised surplus of  7,416,000 in 1937 over seven and three-quarter years from 1938-1945, reducing contributions or improving benefits to the extent of  1,000,000 a year, this will make the balancing point of the Fund 15-1 per cent.   When the  7,416,000 was exhausted, that is after 1945, the Fund would become insolvent unless the mean rate of unem-ployment thereafter was 15 -1 or less.   When the unemployment insurance scheme was put on a new basis less than four years ago, the contributions and benefits were adjusted to make income and expenditure balance at an unemployment rate of about 18-i per cent.   Can we assume for any time in the future a mean rate as low as 15 -1 per cent?26. On the whole, we believe that it is justifiable to do so. As we pointed out in our Third and Fourth Reports, in unem-ployment to-day there is one element-due to the contraction of some of our staple industries which should gradually, if slowly, diminish. As we pointed out in our Second Report, it is reason-able to assume that the mean rate of unemployment over a period of years will be a little below the mid-point between the minimum and the maximum for single years. In 1937 unem-ployment has fallen to a minimum definitely below 11 o. The maximum experienced in 1932 was 21-g, but having regard to &apos; the generally declining course of unemployment, it seems need-less to put the maximum of future years as high as this. If the maximum be put at 21-0 the mid-point between minimum and maximum is 16-o; with 20-0 as the assumed maximum the mid-point is 15 - 5. Even on the assumption of 21 -o as maximum a mean rate of unemployment of about 15-1 is not improbable. But on the facts before us it would be wrong to base the finance of the insurance scheme on any figure below this.  And it would
be dangerous to assume a mean figure as low as 15 -i for the immediate future, that is to say till some years have passed and the unemployment of the staple industries has contracted still more. A decision once more to distribute our disposable surplus over the short space of eight years and so to translate a single sum of  7,416,000 into an annual surplus of  1,000,000, appears to be justified, for this occasion, but is a procedure which almost certainly cannot be repeated on later occasions.Reduction of Debt under the Unemployment Insurance Act,1938.27. If our powers in regard to the Unemployment Fund were no greater to-day than they were last year or than they were when we began the preparation of this Report, declaration of a disposable surplus of  7,416,000 translated into an annual sur-plus of  1,000,000 would be the limit of our operations. It would remain only to consider how this  1,000,000 a year should be used. But the passage into law within the last few days of the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1938, has given us new powers for dealing with the debt of the Unemployment Fund. We turn to consider these new powers and the use that might be made of them.28. Under the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1938, we may recommend application of any part of the Unemployment Fund, whether or not we regard it as a disposable surplus, towards reduction of the funded debt (now standing at  103,122,381) and bring about a proportionate reduction of the debt charge (now fixed at  5,000,000 a year); if, after we have reduced the debt in this way, we find the Fund unable to meet its liabilities we may borrow again within limits defined by the Act. In principle the new Act gives effect to recommendations made by us in our Fourth Report and by our Chairman in a letter sent to the Minister of Labour on 4th November, 1937. What use would it be appropriate to make of our extended powers on this occasion?29. The debt charge of  5,000,000 a year represents nearly 5 per cent, on the amount of the debt. The rate of interest which we are able to earn on the balance of the Unemployment Fund varies, but since we are bound to keep our resources reasonably liquid, is much less than 5 per cent.; at the present moment, the mean rate is about 2 per cent. If a disposable surplus is used to reduce debt the whole proportionate reduc-tion of the debt charge is annual gain to the Fund, since interest on the disposable surplus will not have been taken into account in our expectations. If balances other than a disposable surplus are used for reduction of debt, the loss of expected interest must be set against the reduction of the debt charge. As the rate of interest earned is less than the rate of charge there
remains, on balance an immediate cash gain. Use of any part of the. Unemployment Fund to reduce the debt and propor-tionately to reduce the debt charge represents accordingly an immediate gain to the Fund. The degree of this gain depends upon.which particular investments are sold in order to pay off debt. These will usually be the investments on which relatively high interest can, now be earned. The gain through reduction of debt and debt charge is therefore likely to be less than the difference between nearly 5 per cent, and the average rate of about 2.per cent, now earned by the Fund; it is likely to be 2-  per cent, rather than 3 per cent, on the amount of debt paid off.30. This is the immediate gain that can be won for the Fund by use of our new powers.   Against this immediate gain must be set the risk of later loss, should it become necessary to borrow again.  There are now two distinct powers of borrowing for the Fund, under Section 60 of the Act of 1935 and under Section 4 of the Act of 1938.   The former power is for short borrowing only; any sum advanced to the Fund under the Act of 1935 must be repaid as to one third not later than the end of the first financial year next following the financial year in which the advance was made, and as to the remaining two-thirds not later than the end of the second financial year so following. The new power under the Act of 1938 is for long borrowing; any sums advanced have to be repaid by terminable annuities endinp on 31st March, 1971, as the date when under present arrange-ment the whole of the debt will be extinguished.  It is reasonable to expect that the Unemployment Fund would be able at need to get advances under the Act of 1935 at rates of interest corre-sponding to those paid by the Treasury for similar short loans; these rates are normally much below the rates for long borrow-ing.   But if long borrowing under the Act of 1938 were called for, it might be necessary also to pay more than the rate of interest which from October, 1938, will apply to the existing debt, namely 3-J- per cent.   To use balances in the Fund to pay off debt now to an extent making it certain or highly probable that we should have to borrow later under the Act of 1938 would mean speculating on futures in the rate of interest.   We are not qualified by any special knowledge or experience for opera-tions of this nature.   We should use balances to reduce debt only to the extent that we may reasonably hope not to be forced later to borrow again, except for the short periods contemplated by the Act of 1935.31.. This does not mean that, in considering use of balances for reduction of debt, we must judge the future course of unem-ployment in just the same way as when we are considering the declaration of a disposable surplus. To do so would mean that we could not use for reduction of debt any part of our balance
which we were not prepared to regard as a disposable surplus. The Act of 1938 expressly contemplates use for reduction of debt of sums additional to anything that can be declared as a surplus under Section 59 of the Act of 1935. The problems of declaring a disposable surplus and of using part of our balance to reduce debt are different.32. In deciding whether to declare a disposable surplus or not we are bound to caution; we should err, rf at all, on the side of safety. So far as the nature of our task permits us to feel sure of anything, we ought, before declaring a surplus as dis-posable and spending it in improvement of benefits or lowering of contributions, to feel reasonably sure that our surplus really is disposable and that having improved benefits or reduced con-tributions we shall not have later to reverse the process. In this part of our task, we should, in forecasting unemployment, choose always as in fact we have chosen the higher of the two equally probable figures for the prospective rate of unem-ployment. If there is a real chance of an immediate and severe depression we ought to provide for it, even though we think that there is a greater chance that depression will be postponed.33. In approaching the new problem of debt reduction we may legitimately lean to reasonable optimism in our forecasts. It is indeed our duty to do so. For any reduction of the debt brings us immediate gain. Even if our forecast proves too optimistic and we have later to borrow, we can meet our liabilities for a time by short borrowing at relatively low rates under the Act of 1935. Even if we are driven to borrow under the Act of 1938 and to increase the funded debt once more, there may still be gain in the operations. It is not certain that we shall have to pay a higher rate of interest in re-borrowing than we pay now, and even if we do, the loss may prove less than the gain made before long borrowing is needed. The Act of 1938, as we have stated, contemplates that we should use for reduction of debt balances which are not disposable surpluses. The appropriate sphere for the use of this power appears to us to be defined by the margin between caution and reasonable optimism in forecasting the rate of unemployment. The margin is wide enough to give room for substantial operations.34. On this occasion the margin is wider than usual. Caution compels us to provide for the possibility that to-day&apos;s recession may lead direct to a depression. Reasonable optimism, such as that expressed to us by Mr. Henderson on behalf of the Committee on Economic Information leads to the view that in 1938 and 1939 unemployment will still be low enough to allow the Un-employment Fund to grow in place of being diminished. On this optimistic view, we are in a position to bring about a substantial annual saving to the Fund by reducing debt, with-out any great likelihood of having to reverse the process later
?n6:.aiid increase&quot; the permanent liabilities of the Fund.&apos; With a viewitoio making u that, saving, we recommend accordingly ..that  20,000,000, out oi the moneys now standing to the credit ofj the Unemployment Fund, should be applied to reduction ofitheudebt/ with effect, if. possible * not later than 31st March, 1938.   The debt charge of  5,000,000 will thereby be: reduced0byiabout. 987,000 a year. . Against this must be set the loss&apos; of ^interest i on.  20,000,000. In accord with para. 29 above, the,immediate gain to the Unemployment Fund General Account; anay be put. at;2^ per cent., that is to say  500,000 a year. .&apos; 35.&apos; We make this recommendation, as stated, on the strengthI of.-:the views expressed to.us by the Committee on Economic (Information as to the probable course of events in the next two years.  If these views prove to be over-optimistic we shall prob--ablynotbe able to avoid borrowing again for the Fund. But we hope that we should not be forced to more than temporary^borrowing; and we believe that in any case the uncertain risk of future loss is worth taking for the certain immediate gain. .1 36.,,Adding a saving of  500,000 a year through reduction of debt to the  1,000,000 a year of disposable surplus, we reach a total of about  1,500,000 a year as the sum by which the in-come of the Unemployment Fund seems likely to be and to continue to be in excess of its liabilities.   This is the annual&quot;sum for whose disposal in reduction of contributions or improve-ments of benefit we have now to make recommendations.&quot;37- This annual total of  1,500,000 is made up of two sums, one of.  1,000,000 obtained by spreading  7,416,000 of dis-posal surplus over eight years, and one of  500,000 obtained&quot;by using  20,000,000 out of the balances of the Unemployment- Fund to reduce the debt.;&apos; We have preserved in this Report the distinction between declaring a disposable surplus for dis-- tribution over a period of years and using a balance, whether &apos; disposable or not, to bring about a reduction of the debt charge. : But the distinction seems likely to be of diminishing practical importance in future. For we are approaching a time when &apos; it will be difficult to distribute a disposable surplus overanyperiodmuch shorter than that implied in treating the surplus as a balance J&apos; for reduction of debt.  The procedure adopted in our last report and in this Report of distributing a single sum over a short in period of years has lowered progressively the balancing point ofthe Fund and rests on the assumption of a progressive lowering of the mean level of unemployment to fit the new balancingpoint.. This is a process which cannot continue indefinitely.and -with a balancing point of 13-1 per cent, of unemployment isprobably&apos; already near its end.Representations. 38. As required by section 59 (3) of the Unemployment ^Insurance Act,,1935, we gave notice on 23rd November, 1937,
3117: of our intention to, make a report on the financial condition of the Unemployment Fund. We received written and oral repre-sentations as to the use to be. made of any surplus of the Fund from the National Confederation of Employers&apos; Organisations, the Trades Union Congress General Council, and the Parlia-mentary Committee of the Co-operative Congress. &apos; We received written representations from the Children&apos;s Minimum Council and the Family Endowment Society and from a few other bodies or individuals. We had placed before us a number of resolutions passed by Local Employment Committees.39. The National Confederation of Employers&apos; Organisations urged that reduction, of contributions should be regarded as a first charge on any surpluses that might become available, until contributions had reached a level of 6d. a week from each party for an adult workman, as compared with the iod. fixed in 1931 and the gd. how in force. They. realised that we were not likely in the present or.indeed in any subsequent year to.have a surplus large enough to make a simultaneous all-round re-duction comparable to that of. 1936. They urged, however, that we should proceed by stages, taking off what we could from one class of contributors at a time.40. The Trades Union Congress General Council advocated (1) abolition of the waiting time (2) an all-round increase of rates of benefit (3) reduction of men&apos;s contributions by id. a week and raising.of women&apos;s benefit.by 2s. a-week, so as to.equalise contributions and benefits between men and women (4) amend--ment of the Anomalies Orders so as, to improve the position of women with good industrial records after marriage. , In discussion, we pointed out that the last of these, proposals was probably not-within our legal powers, and was in any case inappropriate for handling in our financial report, while the third involved surpluses beyond our means. We asked the representatives to place their other proposals so far as possible in order of priority. They gave first place to abolition of the waiting time, and among rates of benefit favoured most a further increase of benefit for dependent children.41. The Parliamentary Committee of the Co-operative Con-gress deprecated any lowering of contributions, and favoured an increase of benefit,&apos;giving first place to the rate for adult men, on the ground that families had been helped already by the raising of benefit to children.42. The resolutions from Local Employment Committees were mainly in favour of raising benefit to meet an increase in the cost of living. The Children&apos;s Minimum Council urged that part of any surplus available should be used to increase the&apos; allow-ances for dependent children. The Family Endowment Society, -while. supporting: this proposal, pointed out that it would in-.;crease hie,number of cases of benefit equalling or exceeding
i8wages, and that this represented a problem that must be solved not by keeping down benefit but &apos;&apos; from the wages end &apos;&apos;.43. The general issue between reducing contributions and improving benefits raised by the representations made on behalf of the Employers&apos; Organisations and the Trade Unions respec-tively, was discussed at some length in our Third Report. On that occasion, after setting out the arguments which might be urged on each side and making it plain that the ultimate decision on social policy was one for which the Government and Parliament must take responsibility, we expressed by a majority the view that, in the circumstances of the time, the case for making .the full reduction then possible in rates of contribution appeared to out-weigh the arguments for any other course.   We recommended that the surplus then available or about  6,500,000 a year should be used to reduce the con-tributions of each party in respect of all classes of workpeople aged 18 years and over by id. a week, and this recommenda-tion was accepted by the Government and by Parliament.   On the present occasion we have no such sum at our disposal. We could at most make some such reduction as that of id. a week for women aged 21-64, and id. a week either for boys or for girls of 16-17, or we might make reductions of id. or  d. a week in regard to some of the other small classes, not including adult men.  This would relieve, to the extent of the reductions, the total charge on employers and employees, but it could hardly be a sensible benefit to anyone.   Moreover, unless there were serious prospects of being able to make further, and larger, concessions later, it would leave the scheme of contributions unbalanced.44. We are bound to recognise that, failing some great change in the general level of unemployment, the prospect of any sur-pluses that would make it possible, for instance, to reduce the contributions of adult men, is remote. In these circumstances, we doubt if we should be making the best use of our limited resources in lowering contributions for particular small classes, unless and until we had satisfied ourselves that on the side of benefits the scheme was as adequate as there was any reason ever to make it. It does not appear to most of us to be possible to take this attitude in respect either of the period for which benefit is paid, or of the rates of benefit.-   &apos; -Period of Benefit.45. As regards the period of benefit, the dominant fact is that about half of the insured persons who at any time are regis-tered as unemployed are able to make a claim to unemploy-ment benefit. A certain proportion of those excluded from benefit are persons with rather slender attachment to industry,
and without a. good&apos;industrial record: at any time; their unem-ployment cannot be.regarded as an insurable risk. Others, in the special areas, are members of trades which through exceptional circumstances have been subject to permanent and drastic contraction; they also represent a problem with which unemployment insurance can hardly be expected to deal. But even apart from these two i classes, it is . clear that men. with good recent industrial records may exhaust their claims to benefit, particularly in a cyclical depression of employment. The proportion of the total unemployed now covered by benefit, namely 54-8 per cent., is higher than it has been at any time since 1931, partly owing to extensions in the period of benefit already made, and partly for the reason given in paragraph 13; with the downward turn of employment after a period of in-dustrial activity the recent additions to the register of the unem-ployed have nearly all been persons with claims to benefit. If the recession of employment continues and, above all, if and when we enter into depression, the proportion of the total unemployed who will be able to claim benefit will fall. More and more men will find that they exhaust their rights. In these circumstances, it appears to most of us that there is a strong case for using part at least of the resources now available for extending the period of benefit in the same direction as that adopted in our last report, by making still more liberal the grant of additional days under Section 31 (2) of the Act of 1935.46. Extension of the period of benefit in this way helps first and foremost men of good industrial record and makes it less likely that they will ever have to apply for assistance subject to the Means Test. The reasons given in paragraph 56 of our Fourth Report for regarding improved provision of additional days as preferable to an increase in the standard period of benefit of 26 weeks obtainable by an average of 15 contributions a year, apply in the circumstances of to-day as strongly as last year. Extension of the period of benefit by more additional days, appears to. us preferable, also, to any further change in the waiting time, which was reduced last year from six days to three days. Money given at the beginning of a period of unem-ployment is not as valuable socially as money given at the end, when other, resources have become exhausted. Though we were pressed by the Trades Union Congess General Council to abolish the waiting time altogether, it is right to observe that a waiting period of three days at least is a common condition among trade unions in their systems of benefit.47. In view of the large proportion of total unemployment that still remains without benefit, further extension of the period of benefit by additional days appears to most of us to represent the first call on our surplus. Our specific proposal, is that the provision of additional days under Section 31 (2) of the Act
should be made more ample, by subtracting one additional day for every ten days in place of every eight days of benefit already drawn. We estimate that taking good and bad years together this will increase the expenditure on benefit by approximately  500,000 a year. The expenditure will be relatively greater, and the advantage to insured persons will be correspondingly more felt, in times of heavy unemployment.Rates of Benefit and Wages.48. As regards rates of benefit, we called attention in the conclusion of our Third Report to the difficulty of reaching any reasoned judgment as to their appropriate level. We suggested the need for fuller information both as to the living conditions of unemployed persons and as to the relations between wages, benefit, unemployment assistance and other forms of assistance. &quot; The growing direct provision for families under unemploy-ment insurance and assistance is beginning to raise acutely the general problem of dependency, under a wage system which makes no similar provision.&quot; We expressed the hope that it might be possible to set inquiries on foot that would throw light on this and allied problems.49. Since the date of that report important investigations have been undertaken by the Ministry of Labour as to the cost of living and wages, and are still in progress. On one point of special interest to ourselves we already have the advantage of a completed inquiry. In accordance with our wishes, the Ministry of Labour made a sample investigation of the persons applying for benefit on the 30th August, 1937, asking the applicants to state the weekly rate of wages earned by them in their last employment for a full week&apos;s employment without short time or overtime. This enquiry has resulted in the collection of a great deal of information not hitherto available. For the present purpose it will be sufficient to use some of this information only, as set out in a Memorandum and Statistical Tables printed as Appendix C to this Report. The main results may be summarised briefly as follows:  50. Benefit rates are a long way below wage rates taken as a whole. The average weekly benefit, including dependants&apos; benefit, paid to adult men is 24s. 6d. a week. The median wage rate (that is to say, the rate in the middle, if all rates are arranged in order from bottom to top) is 55s. 6d., that is to say, nearly two and a half times as much. For women the difference is not so great but is substantial. The average weekly benefit, including dependants&apos; benefit, paid to adult women is 15s. 2d. per week; the median wage rate for adult women is 30s., or not quite twice as much. Individual wage rates, however, are so unequal that comparison of statistical averages and medians gives a wrong picture of the relations of
benefit and wages in most individual cases. The range of wage rates shown in the Appendix tables is remarkable, from less than 14s. to more than 100s. (actually in one case  13) a week for men, and from less than 12s. to more than 60s. a week for women. And though the numbers at the extremes of the tables are small, over wide limits there is a very even dispersal of the rates.&quot; In the wage system,, as revealed in these tables, inequality is a dominating feature.51. Benefit rates also are unequal, but they vary on a prin-ciple different from that of wages.   Benefit rates allow directly for dependency; wage rates, though they show a slight increase with the number of dependants, progressing presumably to some extent according to age, are far from making any corres-ponding allowance for dependency.   The median wage for single men is 54s. a week; for men with wives but no de-pendent children is 57s. 6d.; and for men with wives and four children is 59s.   From the fact that wages, broadly speaking, make no allowance for dependency, while unemployment benefit makes a large allowance, it follows that, though the statistical average of benefit rates is much below the statistical median of wage rates, in many individual cases benefit rates are very near to wage rates or even above them.   Allowing for the fact that a man when unemployed saves certain expenses which fall on him during employment, and may have greater opportunities for subsidiary earning, it is estimated in the Memorandum that of 411,191 men claiming in August, 9,510, or 2-3 per cent., were as well off or better off on benefit than ih their last employ-ment; among 138,220 women the number was 7,240, or 5-2 per cent, of all claimants.   These numbers and proportions in the whole body of claimants are small but appreciable.   If, instead of taking all benefit rates all together the- different rates are looked at separately, the proportions of those who are as well off on benefit as in employment rise steadily to larger percent-ages.   Of the 5,293 men on 41s. benefit 530, or 10 per cent., are as well off unemployed as employed.   At a 50s. rate of benefit the proportion as well off unemployed as employed exceeds one-third.   Of the women, relatively few have benefit for dependants, but some do; the proportions as well off unem-ployed as employed naturally rise in the same way as among men, though more rapidly.   Of the men without any depend-ants only 11 per cent, are as well off unemployed as employed; among women the corresponding figure is 4-0 per cent.52. The position revealed by this investigation is unsatis-factory in two ways at least.53. There is an unsatisfactory relation between rates of benefit and wages, in so far as appreciable numbers of men and women are shown to be as well off, or better off, unemployed than employed.   Unemployment benefit as we pointed out in
A 22our Second Financial Report &quot; is the direct alternative to wages:&apos; insurance against^ unemployment is insurance against loss of wages.   It is contrary to the fundamental principle of insurance and the practice of every :other form of insurance, that the indemnity should be allowed to exceed the loss &quot;.54. It is sometimes argued that over-insurance does not matter in regard to unemployment, because the Exchanges are able to test the reality of unemployment7 by offering a workman a vacancy at wages equal to those which he has formerly been earning &apos; they can compel him to take that employment and forfeit his benefit even if the benefit is greater than, or equal to, the wages. This argument is unsound. The Employment Exchanges control only a part of the labour market; they fill about one, in four of all the vacancies in the case of men and a somewhat higher proportion among women. But even if the control of the labour market by the Employment Exchanges were far more - complete than it is, it would be wrong to rely upon this control as a means of forcing men into employment against their economic interest and their desires, that is to say, forcing them into employment which means a lowering and not a gain of income. The aim of the Exchanges is to send to the employer a workman who is likely to meet the employer&apos;s requirements; for the Exchanges to be sending repeatedly men who did not want to accept the post and would take the first opportunity of leaving it, even if they accepted it, would destroy the reputation of the Exchanges. The business of the Exchanges, like that of any other market organization, is to bring together a willing buyer and a willing seller. Reliance upon them to force men into employment against their economic interests would be dangerous and destructive of their utility.55. There is no relation between wages and needs. For men of large family responsibilities, unemployment benefit in many cases is less than the allowance which such men can obtain from the Unemployment Assistance Board if they have no other means, that is to say, unemployment benefit is in those cases less than the standard which according to public judgment is required for full subsistence. At the same time, for a substantial proportion of large families it is more than the wages earned. Unless the standards of subsistence adopted by the Unemploy-ment Assistance Board are too high, a considerable number of large families must be appreciably below the standard even when the father is in work, and could not be brought up to it by any raising of wages generally that is at all likely to occur.56. This raises an issue travelling beyond the special topic of unemployment insurance which is our immediate concern. The investigation made by the Ministry of Labour shows that, with the existing scales of unemployment benefit, over-insurance occurs in an appreciable number of cases, though the number is
small proportionately to the total number of claims. But the fact that it occurs at all is a difficulty in the way of increasing rates of benefit, without some provision for preventing the extension of Over-insurance, by restricting the amount of benefit to be drawn.57. To complete the picture drawn from this comparison of wages and benefit two further comments should be made.58. First the relation of wages and benefit rates differs with different parts of the country. In the large towns, with relatively high wages, the cases in which benefit rates exceed, or approach, wage rates must be rare; for men they are very rare indeed. But the insurance scheme applies on a uniform basis to all parts of the country, including small towns and country districts, where standards of money wages and costs of living are lower. One-fifth of all benefit rates for men are 32s. and upwards, that is to say, are above the maximum of 30s. a week fixed for agricultural unemployment benefit, and are equal to or above many agricultural wages. Yet such benefit rates can be drawn in country districts no less than in towns.59. Second, over-insurance is not limited to cases where the hourly rate of wages is low. A full weekly contribution is paid for a half-day&apos;s employment in a week, so that a workman may qualify for benefit at full weekly rates by work which never brings to him as wages more than a few shillings in a week. This exposes the Unemployment Fund to abuses which may not be extensive but are certainly harmful and discrediting; they may arise in urban and in rural areas alike. There is an undeni-able possibility of qualifying for benefit by trifling or factitious employment and a temptation to do so.60. In our report on Share Fishermen, in relation to Unem-ployment Insurance, we gave illustrations of this which had come under our notice and referred to &quot; the ease with which claims to benefit can be manufactured, and the strength of the temptation to their manufacture where wage standards are low relatively to the rates of benefit &quot;. In one case a number of share-fishermen by working a few hours a week during the busy season in packing for the buyer the fish which they had sold to him were thus getting their stamps, and a claim to benefit. The employment against whose loss they were insuring represented a wage of less than 10s. a week; as compensation for losing this employment a man with a wife and two children would get benefit of 32s. a week. As a remarkable illustration in another field of the possibilities of employment specially designed to enable people to draw unemployment benefit, we give in Appendix D a recent decision of the Umpire on the C-;  Unemployment Association. In this case an association which anyone can join for a payment of id. a week, by expending
c&amp;4,r2s.-6&apos;d. anweek: on wages-plus is. yd. on insurance stamps M.during;30 weeks-making a total expenditure of  6 2S. 6d.  .; is able; to put its members in a.position to draw 26 weeks of ibenefit, which, at.the:rate, of 32s. a week for a man, wife and two children, amounts to  41 12s. od.   By a further expen-diture of  2 os.. iod. in ten weeks it can re-qualify them for a further 26 weeks of benefit, i.e., a further  41 12s. od.. The employment against whose loss the contributors insure is worth a net o.d. a week to them.  The-indemnity may be anything from- r7s. to 50s. a -week. This arrangement has been held to be i legal and: there appears to be nothing to stop the indefinite /growth of this and similar ^associations.v&apos;61! The.: Unemployment Insurance Scheme works without . serious-anomalies in most of the main industries of the country, and confers immense benefits on the industrial population.  We- believe that those benefits could be increased if protection were obtained against minor abuses and dangers, by suitable changes:.fof the law.1 From one point of view, the most logical provision would be a &apos;&apos;. wage-stop &apos;&apos;, that is to say a rule limiting the maximum rate of benefit to be drawn by reference to the. individual wage.   From another point of view, having regard -particularly, to-the fact that the rate of contribution is the same ^irrespective of wages, it might seem more appropriate to have a.-general limit, as a &quot; ceiling &quot; above which benefit could not -rise in any, case. \ 62. Under present conditions the introduction either of a &apos;&apos;-. ceiling &quot;or a &quot; wage-stop &apos;&apos; in unemployment insurance might increase appreciably the number of cases in which unem-ployed men with families would apply for and obtain supple-mentation of benefit from the Unemployment Assistance Board. Apart-from,this practical difficulty, there is much to be: said for:: the view that introduction either of a &quot; ceiling &quot;or of a &quot; wage-^stop &quot; into unemployment insurance raises, issues of social policy, which should be dealt with only by full Parlia---/imentary procedure after special enquiry directed to the question.,:. As was urged by the Family Endowment Society, and is obvious from the figures cited above, the problem of dependency needs to be considered as a whole.   To consider it only in relation to persons who are r.unemployed leads to an impasse in: one -direction or another.63. In the present report we have to take the law as it is.&quot;: In the light of the enquiry made by the Ministry of Labour, and-your interpretation of it, what conclusion should we reach on the issue between raising rates of benefit if we can do so and not raising them?&apos; Looked at as a whole, -the existing scale of benefits cannot be regarded as so fully meeting needs as to make it undesirable to raise them further, if and in as far. as- this can be done without multiplying unduly the evils of,over-
insurance.  If in the General Scheme there were either a &quot; wage-stop &quot;&apos; or a &quot; ceiling     or if on the other hand, the wage system -made ^allowance for dependency, the main objection to further&apos;&apos; increases in-rates of benefit would be removed.   Taking the&apos; insurance scheme and5 the wage system as they are, we come-though not without some hesitation and not unanimously-to-the conclusion that in spite of the certainty of adding to the cases of over-insurance, there is justification for using part of our sur-plus this year for increasing the incomes of persons when unem-ployed.   The particular form of benefit which, having regard both to.the advantage of increasing the income of persons when unemployed and to the social disadvantage of over-insurance, appears most desirable at this juncture, is the benefit to adult dependants.   As appears from Table C.5 in the Appendix, to add is. a week&apos; to the benefit1 for adult dependants increases the number of cases where men are as well off unemployed as employed by less than 10 per cent. If, instead of this, we were to add is. a week to the benefit for each dependent child, the number of such cases would be increased altogether by more than one-third, while for the larger families the contrast between the effects of the two changes is even more notable.  At the 41s. rate of benefit the proportion as well off unemployed as em-ployed is now 10 per cent.; with is. added for the adult-: dependant it will be n per cent.; with the is. added, instead-: of this, for each dependent, child it would be 25 per cent.64. We propose accordingly by a majority that the.rate of benefit for an adult dependant should be raised from its present -figure of gs. a week to 10s. a week.   Allowing for the growth of the insured population we estimate that this will increase the&apos; expenditure of the Fund on benefit, not by  930,000 a year as was stated in our Third Report, but by about  1,000,000 a year.:, With the  500,000 a year devoted to more liberal&quot; grant of additionab days this proposal absorbs the  1,500,000. a year, which will become available if to  1,000,000 a year from dis-posable surplus is added  500,000 a year through acceptance of our recommendation to reduce the debt under the Unemploy-ment Insurance Act, 1938.Summary and Conclusions.65. ;It:fnay be convenient if we summarize what has been said above before presenting in conclusion our formal findings. On the assumptions made after consultation with the Committee on Economic Information as to the prospective level of unem-ployment, and in order to provide for -the changes of contri-butiohs and benefits recommended in our Third and Fourth Reports and put into force by Orders of the Minister of Labour, we required to have in hand on 31st December, 1937, in the General Account of the. Unemployment Fund a balance of
 52&apos;903&apos;000- The actual balance was  60,379,000, that is to sav.  7.416,000 above requirements. For reasons set out above we feel justified in treating this excess as a surplus disposable over the eight-year period 1938-45. Allowing for interest and assuming 1st April, 1938, as the earliest date upon which any changes proposed by us in this Report can come into force, this provides for additional expenditure from 1st April, 1938, to 31st December, 1945, at the rate of  1,000,000 a year. The effect of adding expenditure on this scale to the liabilities of the Fund (or reducing contributions by an equal amount) is to reduce the balancing point of the Fund, that is to say, the rate of unemployment at which the income and expenditure may be expected to balance, to 15-1. That is to say, in order to justify this proposal we are bound to assume that after 1945 the mean rate of unemployment over a period of years will not be above 75.J.   ,66. If our powers this year had been the same as last year, distribution of  1,000,000 a year from disposable surplus would have been the limit of our financial proposals. Under the Unem-ployment Insurance Act of 1938, however, which passed into law just before this Report was signed, we are in a position to use balances of the Unemployment Fund, whether we regard them as disposable surpluses or not, to reduce the debt of the Fund, and by so doing can reduce proportionately the debt charge, which was fixed in the Act of 1934 at  5,000,000 a year. After discussing the principles which shculd guide us in the use of these new powers, we recommend that  20,000,000 of tin-balance of the Unemployment Fund should be applied to reduc-tion of debt. The effect of this proposal, allowing on the one hand for the reduction of the debt charge, and on the other hand for the loss of interest, is to increase the resources of the Unemployment Fund by about  500,000 a year. Adding this to the  1,000,000 derived from our disposable surplus, we reach a total of  1,500,000 a year as available for improvement of benefits or reduction of contributions if our recommendation for reduction of the debt is accepted.67. We recommend by a majority that this sum should be used to improve in two ways the provision for unemployment:   (a) by increasing in benefit years beginning on or after 1st January, 1938, the number of additional days of benefit that can be drawn by men who have worked regularly during the past five years while drawing relatively little in benefit; (6) by increasing as from 1st April, 1938, or as near as may be thereto, the benefit for an adult dependant from 9s. to 10s. a week. Taking good and bad years together the first of these changes is estimated to cost about  500,000 a year and the second change is estimated to cost about  1,000,000 a year.
68. a In /connection with, the second j of these recommendations, we.give the results of an investigation made at our request by the ^Ministry, of Labour as to the weekly rates of wages of claimants to unemployment benefit and the relation of these wages to the rates of benefit to which they are-entitled. The result of this enquiry is to show that while the average rate of benefit-drawn by men as a whole, as by women as a whole, is materially below the statistical average of the wages earned by them, the actual wages earned by - considerable proportions of those with large family responsibilities; are such as to make the recipients as-well off when unemployed as when in employment, or even better-off. In addition to this general problem of over-insurance in relation to weekly rates of wages, we refer to further possibilities of over-insurance of persons whose normal employ-ment is irregular and-the temptation beld out thereby to the making of factitious claims to benefit.69. We conclude our Report on the financial condition of the Unemployment Fund in respect of its General Account:  (1) By recommending under Section 3 (1) of the Unem-ployment Insurance Act, 1938, that an amount of  20,000,000 out of the Unemployment Fund, and standing to the credit of the General Account of that Fund, should be applied to discharge of the liabilities of the Fund mentioned in sub-section (2) of Section 60 of the Unemploy-ment Insurance Act of 1935;(2) By reporting formally under Section 59 (2) of the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1935, that the Unemploy-ment Fund, in respect of its General Account, is and is likely to continue to be more than reasonably sufficient to discharge its liabilities;(3) By recommending, by a majority, as changes required to make the Fund in- respect of its General Account not more than reasonably sufficient on the assumption that our first recommendation is adopted (i) that in para, (b) of Section 31 (2) as amended by the Unemployment Insurance (Additional Days and Waiting Period) Order, 1937, for the word &quot; eight &quot; should be substituted the word &quot; ten &quot;, so that the paragraph will run as follows :  &quot; (b) the maximum number of additional days in any benefit-year shall be computed, in the case of an insured contributor qualified for such days, by allowing to him days at the rate of three for every five contributions paid in respect of him as an insured contributor in respect of the last five years/less one day for every ten days in respect of which benefit has been paid to him in respect of the benefit years which ended in the last five years &quot;.
(ii) That in Section 38 (1) of the Act specifying the amount by which the weekly rate of benefit shall be increased in respect of adult dependants, for the words &quot; nine shillings &quot; should be substituted the words &quot; ten shillings &quot;.(hi) That the change in paragraph (i) should apply to benefit years beginning on or after 1st January, 1938, and that the change in paragraph (ii) should be made so as to be in operation so far as practicable by 1st April, 1938. (4) By  estimating that  these  recommendations  will increase the expenditure of the Fund by approximately  1,500,000 a year.We have the honour to be, Sir, Your obedient servants.
MINORITY REPORT.I. We are in agreement with the general findings regarding the financial condition of the Unemployment Fund, as set out in the Main Report, and we approve of the repayment of  20,000,000 of the debt. We are, however, unable to agree to the disposal of an annual surplus of  1,500,000 in the manner recommended by the majority of the Committee.2. The present large balance in the Fund, and the large amounts which have been disposed of, following the various recommendations of the Committee in previous years, are mainly due to excessively high rates of contribution.3. The proposal to increase the liabilities of the Fund by increasing benefits before having restored the rates of contribu-tions to their pre-emergency level is, in our view, wrong.4. As was pointed out in paragraph 44 of the Report made in February, 1936, on the Financial Condition of the Fund, there is grave danger in adopting any course of action which cannot readily be retraced. A reduction of contributions is more readily retraced than is an increase of benefits, either in amount or in duration.5. The present Report shows that the disposable surplus in the Fund at 31st December, 1937 ( 7,416,000) provides  1,000,000 per year as being disposable over about eight years. To this is added-a further disposable amount of  500,000 per year, which arises from the reduction of the debt charge as a result of the application of  20,000,000 to reduction of debt.6. Where a more or less permanent means of disposal of sur-pluses is contemplated, the adoption of the eight years&apos; cycle is reasonable, but, in the case of applying a disposable surplus to reduction of contributions, this long term view is not necessary. Instead of disposing the cash sum of  7,416,000 over rather less than eight years at the rate of  1,000,000 per year, in the manner proposed by the majority of the Committee, it could be  and in our view should be applied to the reduction of con-tributions at the rate of about  3,800,000 per year for two years. Adding to this the  500,000 per year, arising from the reduction of debt charge, a total amount of about  4,300,000 a year becomes available for the alleviation of the existing excessively high rates of contributions.7. The rates of contributions for all classes below that of adults, are high relative to the respective rates of benefit, when these are compared with the contributions benefit ratio of adults. The rates of contributions for young men and women aged 18-20, at 8d. and 7d. respectively, are onerous.
8. We recommend, therefore, that the. rates of contributions be reduced, absorbing  4,300,000 during each of the two years commencing 4th July, 1938, in the following manner:  9. In conclusion, we would emphasise that if reductions in rates of contributions are to be postponed until surpluses are so large that, when spread over eight years, they will permit of a general reduction in contributions, it is clear that there is little or no chance,of any future reduction.Further, the law lays down that these surpluses must be dis-posed of when they emerge they cannot be laid aside and accumulated until they are large enough to permit of a general reduction in contributions and when they are devoted to add-ing to the liabilities of the Fund, instead of to reducing contribu-tions, that fact of itself not only necessarily postpones any reduction in contributions, but raises the possibility of the con-tributions having to be increased, at some future time, above their present high level.In .the last resort it is the weekly contributions which provide the real security of the system, and the reduction of these con-tributionsin times of relative prosperity to such a level as would enable them to be increased in times of emergency without undue detriment to the contributors, is, in our view, the greatest security for. the solvency of the^system and its permanent welfare.Men (21-64) Women (21-64) Young Men (18-20) Young Women (18-20)from 9d.8d 8d 7d 5d 4hto 8^d.7*d.7d. ,, 6d.4d-3d.Boys (16-17) Girls (16-17)
3iSecond Report on the Financial Condition of the Unemployment Fund (Agricultural Account), as at 31st December, 1937To the Rt. Hon. Ernest Brown, M.C., M.P., Minister orLabour. ,Sir,By Section 8 (i) of the Unemployment Insurance (Agri-culture) Act, 1936, we are required to exercise our function of reporting on the financial condition of the Unemployment Fund separately in respect of its General and of its Agricultural Accounts.We submit below our second report in respect of the Agri-cultural Account, which we propose to describe in future as the Second Agricultural Report. Since unemployment benefit under the Unemployment Insurance (Agriculture) Act, 1936, did not become payable until 5th November, 1930, this is the first report covering a full year of the full working of the Agricultural Section of Unemployment Insurance.1. We attach in the second part of Appendix A a formal account of the receipts and expenditure of the Fund on the agricultural side up to 31st December, 1937, similar to that given in the first part of the Appendix for the general scheme. The receipts of the Agricultural Account shown in this table were  1,877,628, of which all but  17,997 represented insurance contributions by employers, employed persons and the State. The expenditure was  700,016 made up of  455,000 for unem-ployment benefit and  245,016 for administrative and minor items. In accordance with a recommendation made by our-selves in our original report on the application of insurance to agriculture, the administrative expenses of the agricultural scheme have been taken as one-eighth of the net contribution income.2. As appears from the foregoing statement, the Agricultural Account like the General Account during the past year has had income greatly in excess of expenditure. During the year 1937 the income has averaged  36,000 a week, expenditure on benefit has averaged  9,000 a week, and other expenditure has averaged  5,000 a week. During the year, accordingly, the Unemployment Fund has added  1,177,612 to its reserves on the Agricultural Account, making, with the  647,375 in hand at 31st December, 1936, a total balance at 31st December, 1937.. of  1,824,987.
3. The reasons for this large gain in the Agricultural Account can be considered most conveniently, after a brief review of the unemployment experience of the year, as set out in the second part of Appendix B and in Tables 1, 2 and 3 below.4. The first of these tables shows the percentages unemployed in Great Britain for each month from November, 1936, to December, 1937, distinguishing males and females and the various sections covered by the scheme. -

The figures for the first two months may be affected by the fact that benefit only began to be paid in November, 1936, and some men may have failed to register who could do so; this may account for some of the increase shown in November and December, 1937, on the percentages twelve months before. The agricultural unemployment percentages, like those of other industries are affected by the changed method of counting introduced in September, 1937, but not to the same degree; the difference between &apos;&apos; old count &apos;&apos; and &apos;&apos; new count &apos;&apos; is only 01, and is ignored in calculating means for the year 1937. Taking all classes together, the mean unemployment percentage for the year is 4-1, of which 48 per cent, ranked for benefit.5. Of the four sections in which all those insured under the agricultural scheme are classified, the largest section &quot; Farming, Forestry, etc.&quot; has an unemployment rate practically the same as that of the whole body namely, 4-0 per cent. Market gardening and horticulture has a higher rate 5-8 per cent., while &quot; Other Gardening &quot; at 3-9 per cent, is just below, and private gardening at 2-1 per cent, is well below, the mean for the whole body of workers. Private gardeners were brought into the scheme for contributions on 1st February, 1937, and for benefit towards the end of June, 1937. Their numbers are con-siderable exceeding 105,000 so that their inclusion has cori-tributed materially to the financial gain of the year. For nearly five months they were contributing without drawing benefit, and for the rest of the year their unemployment was less than half the mean for all those insured.6. Table 1 shows also that the markedly higher rate of unem-ployment among females than among males, to which attention was called in our report last year, has continued throughout the year, and is found in each of the four sections separately. For all males included, the mean unemployment percentage in 1937 has been 3-5, while that for females is 13&apos;j, or nearly four times as much. The rates of unemployment for males and females and in each section of the industry show, as might be expected, a strong seasonal movement, with a maximum of unemployment taking all classes together of 7-4 per cent, in December and a minimum of 2:1 in June.

It will be seen that the rate of unemployment in Scotland is materially higher than the rate in Great Britain as a whole, in farming and forestry no less than in other sections. This confirms the view expressed in our report of December, 1934 (after examina-tion of census statistics) that in spite of the greater use of yearly and six-monthly Wrings in Scotland, the rate of unemployment for all agricultural workers in Scotland was likely to be above, rather than below, the rate for England. The number of long hirings for which a rebate of contributions has been claimed has been much below expectations. In view of the heavy administrative expense involved in giving the rebates, it may soon become a question for consideration whether the con-cession of rebates is worth while.Table 3.

Table 3 gives for 13th December, 1937, the numbers and percentages unemployed in each Division, the proportions ranking for benefit and the resulting percentages on benefit, distinguishing in each case men, young men, women and young women. The contrast between the sexes is remarkable. Of 48,982 insured persons, aged 16-64, unem-ployed in December in&apos; agriculture, 14,342 or 29-3 per cent, were females, though the proportion of females among the persons insured is only 5-7 per cent. The rate of unemploy-ment for men is 5-7.per cent, with 53 per cent, ranking for benefit, and a resulting percentage of 3-0 on benefit. For women the corresponding figures are 39-7, 74-9 and 29-8. For particular Divisions the figures are even more startiing. In the North Eastern Division, including the fruit and vegetable grow-ing districts of Lincolnshire, 65 per cent, of all women insured
in the agricultural scheme were unemployed in December, and nearly 80 per cent, of those unemployed were claiming benefit. In the Midlands and in the South-East the percentages were only a little less.9. It is now possible to suggest some of the reasons for the large financial gain of the agricultural account during 1937. The expenditure on benefit was only about 27 per cent, of the income available for benefit (after deduction of one-eighth for administration). Part, but only part, of this gain was due to the lower rate of unemployment and lower proportion ranking for benefit. In framing the finance of the scheme it was assumed that in the first year after benefit became payable the account would balance with unemployment at 7 - 5 per cent, and 57 per cent, ranking for benefit. On this basis the income of the account, after adjustment to exclude private gardeners, might have been expected to exceed expenditure by about  800,000. The actual excess has been  1,177,612. About half the difference is explained by the inclusion of private gardeners. The rest is explained by the relatively large proportion of the total unemployment that is contributed by women, at a lower rate of benefit than men and seldom with any claim for de-Eendants, by the small amount refunded for long hirings, and y the receipt, in 1937, of interest earned on the balance in the account and of contributions that should have been paid in 1936.10. There is a falling short of expectations in respect of the numbers insured. Apart from private gardeners, the numbers insured under the agricultural scheme at the time of the ex-change of unemployment books in July, 1937, is estimated at 589,300, as compared with a provisional estimate of 600,000 for July, 1936. In the view of the Ministry of Labour the pro-visional estimate for July, 1936, can be taken as approximately correct, so that there appears to have been a decline in the number of agricultural workers. As was stated in our First Agricultural Report, the number of unemployment books issued under the agricultural scheme was materially below expectations founded on the census of 1931. Since the experience of 1936 has been confirmed by that of 1937, the suggestion of a sub-stantial decline in the number of agricultural workers since the census is also confirmed. A contributory cause of the small number of agricultural unemployment books issued is to be found probably in the unexpectedly large extent of mixed em-ployment. Many of those who were expected to come under the agricultural scheme appear to have established a claim to insure under the general scheme.11. It is in the light of the facts briefly summarised above that we have to report on the financial condition and prospects of the  Agricultural  Scheme  of  Unemployment  Insurance.
Obviously the experience of the past year cannot be taken as typical of the normal working of the scheme. 4-1 per cent, is the mean of unemployment in a good year. But neither the experience of the General Account of the Unemployment Fund (in which the minimum of unemployment is kept high, among other things, by the condition of the depressed areas), nor the very different experience of Trade Union unemployment before the War, is a safe guide as to the probable relation between the minimum of a good year and the mean over a period of years, taking good and bad together. It can be taken for certain that the rate of unemployment over a period of years will be materially higher; from 4-4 in December, 1936, the rate has risen to 7-4 in December, 1937, and may easily rise much further. Apart from the difference to be expected on general grounds between the rate of unemployment in a year of business activity like 1937, and the mean rate over a period of years, there are two special considerations, both tending to suggest that the experience of the Agricultural Account in coming years may be materially less favourable than in the past year.12. In the first place, a considerable number of agricultural contributors are now receiving unemployment allowances, be-cause they have exhausted their claim to agricultural benefit, or have insufficient contributions to qualify. This may be due to a considerable extent to the shortness of the period during which agricultural contributions have been payable. If this is so, the percentage of agricultural unemployment ranking for benefit will tend to rise.13. In the second place, the amount of mixed employment as between industry and agriculture has proved unexpectedly high; that is to say, an unexpectedly large proportion of men have contributed both in the General Scheme and in the Agricul-tural Scheme. Such men must claim in the first instance under the General Scheme, with its higher benefits, but when they have exhausted their claim there, they will use their agricultural contributions to claim agricultural benefit. That is to say, in a depression, the claims upon the Agricultural Account must be expected to rise disproportionately.14. For these reasons it is by no means certain from the experience of 1937 that the income of the Agricultural Scheme is permanently and largely in excess of its expenditure. But it is difficult to avoid the suggestion, on the figures quoted above, that an excess is probable. Even if the unemployment rate proved to be as high as was assumed originally, it now seems likely that the agricultural account would have a surplus. Without going more precisely into the matter than our informa-tion warrants, we feel bound to reoort our opinion, in accord-ance with Section 59 (2) of the Act of 1935, that the income of the Unemployment Fund on its Agricultural Account is, and is likely to continue to be, more than reasonably sufficient to
discharge its liabilities.  We have next to report the represehta- &quot; tions made to us on behalf of employers and employees and to consider what recommendations for change of benefits or con-tributions we should make in the light of these representations.15. The representatives of employers suggested that for various reasons unemployment in agriculture had been abnor-mally low in 1937, and that in a normal year the calls on the Fund might be expected to be much higher. If, however, it was clear that there was a surplus in the Fund for disposal, they suggested that it should be used to reduce contributions for those regularly engaged in agriculture.16. The representatives of employees asked that the waiting period for benefit should be abolished; that the maximum of thirty shillings on the weekly rate of benefit should be removed; and that weekly benefit rates should be increased in the case of young&apos;men aged 18 to 20 by 2s. 6d., in the case of men aged 21 and over by is. 6d., and in the case of women aged 21 and over by 6d. They called our attention also to the operation under the Agricultural Scheme of the rule that an insured con-tributor who exhausts his claim to benefit cannot claim again till he has made ten fresh contributions since exhausting benefit.17. For each individual a benefit year begins when he first makes an effective claim, and the period for which he can draw benefit in the twelve months following is settled on that date by the state of his account at that date. In the Agricultural Scheme this period is proportional to the number of his un-exhausted contributions, i.e., contributions in respect of which he has not drawn benefit already. This proportioning rule is peculiar to the Agricultural Scheme, but there has also been imported into that scheme from the general scheme the require-ment that, after benefit has been exhausted, ten new contribu-tions are needed as a re-qualification. The combination of the proportioning and the re-qualifying rules in the Agricultural Scheme produces anomalies which can be explained most simply by an illustration.18. Let it be supposed, for instance, that a man made his first claim on ist December, 1936, satisfying the first statutory condition of twenty contributions and having enough unexpired-exhausted contributions to allow an assessment to be made authorising 60 days&apos; benefit in the benefit year to 30th November, 1937. After drawing benefit for 55 days he secured employment in February, 1937, and continued in employment, making fresh contributions, till 15th November. He then fell out of work, and drew the last five days of benefit under his assessment of ist December, 1936; but thereafter, in spite of his many months of work and contributions during the spring, summer and autumn of 1937, could draw no benefit in respect
of those contributions, unless and until he obtained a further ten contributions, since exhausting benefit in November. He might remain unemployed and without benefit all through the winter months of 1937-8, though he would have been able during those months to claim benefit in respect of his 1937 contributions (a) if he had become unemployed in 1936 just before instead of just after 15th November;(&amp;) if he had remained unemployed in the winter of 1936-7 for five days longer, or had had less work in 1936 and a smaller right to benefit on 1st December, 1936, so that he exhausted his claim before, and not after, making his new contributions in 1937. 19. Cases fitting this illustration are quite likely to occur in the seasonal conditions of agriculture and are clearly anomalous. They arise through the combination in the Agricultural Scheme of the proportioning limit, on the period of benefit with the requirement of ten re-qualifying contributions    The proposal which we make below for dealing with this point should not be regarded as a precedent for changing the re-qualifying r&quot;;uire-ment under the General Scheme, where the proportioning rule does not apply.20. We examined the representations made to us in the light of the general consideration that, after so short experience of the Agricultural Scheme, it would be wrong to propose any changes of principle, or any large changes on which it would be hard to retrace our steps if events took an unfavourable turn. This principle in our view rules out change in any of the major rates of benefit. But we propose four changes which are free from this objection and appear to be justified even after our short experience of agricultural insurance.21. Our first proposal is that the change made in the course of 1937 in regard to the General Scheme, of reducing the waiting period from six days to three, should be applied to the Agricultural Scheme. There appears to be no reason, apart from financei for maintaining a six-day waiting period in agri-culture while thei-e is a three-day waiting period for other insured persons; it was urged by the representatives of the employees that lower wages made the agricultural worker less able than the industrial worker to provide anything even for the first three days of unemployment. There are obvious advantages, more-over, in having the same waiting period in both schemes even if there is no compelling need for such similarity. We propose accordingly that as from 1st April, 1938, or thereabouts, the waiting period in the agricultural scheme should be three days in place of six. We estimate that this &quot;change will increase expenditure under the Agricultural Scheme by approximately  50,000 a year.
22. Our second proposal relates to the rate of contribution. The scheme of Unemployment Insurance for Agriculture, as set out in the Report which we made on this subject in December, 1934, proposed for adult males in agriculture a benefit rate of 12s. a week in respect of a joint contribution of I2d. a week (i.e., 4d. each from employer, employee and the State). With a view to securing general acceptance of unem-ployment insurance in agriculture, we felt that the imposition of a joint contribution in excess of is. a week should be avoided. We added that &quot; there is always the hope that agricultural unemployment in future may prove less than in the past six or seven years and allow an improvement of benefit on the contributions proposed &quot;. But when the Scheme came to be considered by H.M. Government and Parliament, the view was taken that it was of great importance to raise the rates of benefit, and, in particular, to give to adult men more than 12s. a week; it was felt that if such a proposition involved the imposition of a higher general contribution than is. a week, a higher contribution would be justified and would meet with acceptance. The contribution of each of the three parties, accordingly, in respect of an adult male, was put, not at 4d. a week, but at 4^d. a week; the contributions proposed by us for adult women, young men and young women were also raised by  d,. from each party, and varying adjustments were made in the scales of benefit. We give in the Table below our original proposals for each class, compared with the rates, of contribution and benefit now in force.	Original Proposals.				In force at present.

F. 12s. 6d. 9S. 6d. 5S-3s. 6d.23. Now, the experience of 1937 suggests that there is at least a reasonable prospect that the higher benefit rate of 14s. a week for adult males, with the correspondingly higher rates for other classes, can be supported for a lower, contribution than that which is now being paid. We are of the opinion, accord-ingly, that the weekly rates of contribution by employed persons and&apos;by employers in respect of men, women, young men- (18 and under 21) and young women (18 and under 21) respectively,
should all be reduced by  d. to the figures which we named in our first Report. In making this proposal, we desire to emphasise the slender basis of experience on which it rests. We cannot be sure, if our proposal is accepted, that unemployment in agriculture will not rise to a point making it necessary to raise contributions again to their present point. But we find it hard to believe that this is likely and we are unwilling to keep eon-tributions at a level which may ultimately prove to be unneces-sarily high. In any case the substantial balance already accumulated places the Agricultural Account in a position to bear without difficulty substantial losses, and guarantees time for readjustment to adverse developments. This reduction of contributions should be regarded as specially subject to reversal if longer experience shows the need for increasing the income or reducing the expenditure of the Agricultural Account. We estimate that this change will reduce the income of that account by about  180,000 a year. Incidentally it will reduce by one-eighth of  180,000, that is to say by  22,500 a year, the sum charged to the Account as expenditure for administration.24. Our third proposal is that the benefit for young men of 18 and less than 21 should be raised from ios. 6d. to 12s. a week. At present young men get 2s. a week less in benefit than adult women though they pay the same contribution and have much less unemployment; they get only is. a week (or about 10 per cent.) more than young women, though under our second proposal they will be paying ^d. a week, or 16 per cent., more in contribution. There appears to be ground for bringing relative benefits and contributions into better alignment, by the increase that we propose. We estimate that the change will increase expenditure on the Agricultural Account by about  5,000 a year.25. Our fourth proposal is that the requirement of ten fresh contributions since exhausting benefit should apply under the Agricultural Scheme only where a man has exhausted his benefit through drawing 300 days in a benefit year, and not where he has exhausted benefit under the rule proportioning benefit to unexhausted contributions. This proportioning rule is peculiar to the Agricultural Scheme, and serves both to make the requirement of ten fresh contributions unnecessary as a financial safeguard in most cases and anomalous in operation. On the other hand it is both logical and desirable on practical grounds to maintain this requirement where exhaustion of benefit takes place through payment for 300 days in a year. Without this requirement a man who had accumulated a large reserve of contributions might draw the maximum of benefit for two years in succession without doing any more work and though in fact he had retired from the industry. We estimate that the change proposed would increase expenditure on the Agricultural Account by about  10,000 a year.
26. Our three proposals for improvement in the benefits of the scheme by reduction of the waiting time, by increase of the rate of benefit for young men, and by change of the contribution qualification for benefit involve additional expenditure of  65,000 a year. Setting against this the reduction of  22,500 in the charge for administration, the net addition to expenditure is  42,500 a year.27. We conclude this our Second Report on the financial condition of the Unemployment Fund in respect of its Agricul-tural. Account:  (1) By reporting formally under section 59 (2) of the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1935, and section 8 of the Unemployment Insurance (Agriculture) Act, 1936, that the Unemployment Fund, in respect of its Agricultural Account, is, and is likely to continue to be, more than reasonably sufficient to discharge its liabilities.(2) By recommending as changes required to make the Fund, in respect of its Agricultural Account, not more than reasonably sufficient:(i) that section 31 (6) of the Act, as amended last year to reduce from six days to three in relation to benefit other than agricultural benefit the waiting time for which benefit is not payable at the beginning of a period of continuous unemployment, should be amended further so as to make the reduction of vvait-ing time applicable also to agricultural benefit.(ii) that in the second Schedule to the Unemploy-ment Insurance (Agriculture) Act, 1936,for 4^d. as the weekly rate of contribution by the employed person and by the employer in the case of men who have attained the age of 21 years, there should be substituted 4d. for 4d. as the weekly rate of contribution by the employed person and by the employer in the case of women who have attained the age of 21 years, and of young men between the ages of 18 and 21 years, there should be substituted 3M.for 3^d. as the weekly rate of contribution by the employed person and by the employer in the case of young women between the ages of 18 and 21 years, there should be substituted 3d.(iii) that in the Third Schedule to the Unemploy-ment Insurance (Agriculture) Act, 1936, for 10s. 6d. as the weekly rate of agricultural benefit in the case of young men between the ages of 18 and 21 years, there should be substituted 12s.

(2) up to July, 1937, are the finally revised percentages published in the Ministry of Labour Gazette and include the Special Schemesfor Banking and Insurance.   If the latter were excluded, the percentages would usually be about 0-2 higher.   The figures in Cols. (3) and (4)exclude Special Schemes.   The percentage figures in Col. (2) from July, 1937, onwards may be subject to slight revision in November, 1938. (2) There was no change in the rates of contribution between November, 1931, and September, 1934.   As from 3rd September, 1934, juveniles under 16became insurable the rate of contribution being 2d. each from Employer, Worker and State, irrespective of sex.   As from 6th July, 1936, the ratesof contribution for persons aged 18 and over were each reduced by id. from each party. (3) As from 1st July, 1934, the rates of benefit were restored to the levels in operation before 8th October, 1931, when an Economy cut of 10 per cent, was imposed.   As from 31st October, 1935, the weekly rate of benefit for each dependent child was increased from 2s. to 3s. (4) As from 26th July, 1934, the amount of benefit payable in a benefit year was increased by the grant of additional days under Section 3, UnemploymentInsurance Act, 1934, in cases where there had been a good contribution record in the five years preceding the claim.   This grant was increased in respect of benefit years beginning on or after 1st January, 1937. (5) As from 25th March, 1937, the waiting period was reduced from six days to three days.(6) The figures of Income and Expenditure are provisional figures prior to the detailed examination of the relevant accounts.(7) The funded debt of the Unemployment Fund at 1st July, 1934, was ^105,780,000 ; repayment has been made at the rate of  5,000,000 a vear including principal and interest.* The method of taking the count of the unemployed was revised in September, 1937, with the object of ensuring with closer accuracy that persons on the Exchange registers but not actually unemployed on the day of the count are not included in the total. For 13th September, 1937 (Cols. (2)-(5)) the figures in line (a) have been compiled on the old basis and are comparable with those for earlier dates ; those in line (b) have been compiled on the new basis.

APPENDIX C. Relation of Wage Rates and Benefit Rates.The information given in this memorandum is based on a special enquiry made through the Employment Exchanges. Among the claimants for unemployment benefit on the register on 30th August, 1937, all whose benefit rate with dependants exceeded 32s., and 1 in 10 by sample of those with lower benefit rates, were asked to state the weekly wages earned by them in their last employment. The instructions for the enquiry asked for wages for a full week without overtime or short-time in the occupation in which the applicant was last employed; in the case of casual workers, the wages recorded were to be those for days at the normal daily rate of pay.The figures given are based upon the statements of the claimants, and have not been checked, except in extreme cases. But enquiry in these extreme cases has confirmed the correctness of the information; there is no obvious reason either for over-statement or under-statement; the results show the kind of distribution that might be expected. The remarkably-low rates recorded for some of the men are discussed at the end of this memorandum. The results of the enquiry are not a wage census of the employed population, since they represent only those who fell out of work. It will be a matter of great interest to compare them with the results of the more general enquiry as to wages to be conducted by the Ministry of Labour. Meanwhile, they give information as to the wage rates of a large section of the insured population and as to how these rates compare with rates of benefit in particular cases.Tables Ci and C2 classify the men and the women respectively by wage rates, running from less than 14s. to over 100s. a week for men, and from under 12s. to over 61s. a week for women.Tables C3 and C4 classify the men and the women respectively by benefit rates, comparing those rates with median and quartile wage rates for each class. As compared with the median rates of wages, benefit rates art low, less than a third of the wage rates for single men (at 17s. a week) and not exceeding two-thirds till we reach men with wife and five dependent children at 41s. a week. With women the difference between benefit rates and median wage rates is not quite so great; for single women the benefit rate of 15s. is just half the median wage rate of 30s. The average rate of benefit, including dependant allowances, paid to all adult men is 24s. 6d. a week, while their median wage rate is 55s. 6d. The average benefit paid to all adult women, including dependant allowances, is 15s. 2d. a week, while their median wage rate is 30s.Medians and quartiles are used in place of arithmetic averages of the wage rates as involving less labour in calculation and giving an equally good means of general comparison. The upper quartile in nearly every case is further from the median than the lower quartile, suggesting that the arithmetic average will be above rather than below the median. This is found to be the case for the one class for which an arithmetic average has been calculated, namely adult men; the median wage is 55s. 6d. a week while the arithmetic average is 57s.

The lower quartile is the rate of the man half-way between the bottom and the median (i.e., the 37,483rd man) and the upper quartile is the man half-way between the median and the top (i.e., the 112,447th man).
Table c5 analyses the men claiming insurance benefit on 30th August, 1937, according to their weekly benefit rates. Column 2 of this table gives the total number of men at each rate, ranging from 14s. a week to 56s. a week or over, according to age and family circumstances. Columns 3 and 4 show respectively the numbers and the percentages of claimants at each rate whose benefit is equal to or greater than the wages earned by them in a full week of employment.Columns 5 and 6 make a similar comparison between the wage rates and benefit rates increased by 4s. to allow for the difference of needs as between employment and unemployment. When employed, a workman incurs expenses for insurance contributions, for travelling, for wear of clothes, for food, which in part or in whole he need not incur when unemployed. He has also, when unemployed, an increased opportunity of subsidiary earnings, since his time is his own, and under the rules of the Insurance Scheme lie is allowed a certain amount of subsidiary earnings. The workman&apos;s share of his insurance contributions for health and pensions and unemployment amounts by itself to is. yd. a week. The cost of travelling to work varies, of course, greatly from one man to another. In the Cost of Living Enquiry of 1918 this cost was estimated at an average of is. a week, but the figure must be increased considerably to allow both for the greater cost of travelling over the same distance and for the greater distances that workmen in many cases have to travel. Investi-gations made by the London County Council at their housing estates, by the Ministry of Labour, and by the Railway Companies as to the work-merits tickets issued by them, suggest that a figure of from 2s. to 3s. 6d. a week for travelling would be not unreasonable. For the other items mentioned above of extra cost of food and clothes and lessened chance of subsidiary employment no figures can be given. But even if the nett cost of travelling during employment as compared with unemployment is put as low as is. 6d. a general figure of 4s. a week to cover all items and represent the difference between employment and unemployment is probably a minimum.Table C6 gives for women information corresponding to that for men in Table C5, with 3s. a week in place of 4s. as the additional cost of living in employment. Women pay slightly smaller insurance contributions and probabl\, as a rule, travel less; on the other hand, the savings which they are able to bring about when unemployed through doing housework for themselves or for others may be greater than in the case of men.Columns 7 and 8 in C5 show the effect of increasing the benefit for adult dependants by is. a week, and Columns 9 and 10 show the effect of increasing&apos;children&apos;s benefit by is. a week.It will be seen that the first of these changes increases the number who are as well off, or better off, unemployed as employed from 9,510 to 10,397, or by about 9 per cent. The second of these changes increases the number from 9,510 to 12,712, or by about 33-7 per cent.; it has most effect, naturally, with the larger families.

In a small proportion of cases the supplementary information shows that the original statement of wages was mistaken; the wages quoted were for short time, or were wages supplemented by board and lodging. But in the main the correctness of the original return is confirmed. Among unemployed claimants to benefit is a small group of men with miserably low rates of normal earning; some of them, no doubt, barely capable of work, others of a low industrial value, others taking boys&apos; work as men. Four-fifths of them are without dependants; this includes presumably both men who are below the normal age of marriage and men advanced in years.
In statistics of wages this group of low paid men is not important, but it furnishes an appreciable proportion of those to whom unemployment benefit is better worth having than wages.APPENDIX D.Decision by Umpire on a Claim to Benefit.On the facts before me my decision is that contributions paid in respect of the claimant for the period 31st January to 21st August, 1936, were paid in respect of bona fide employment.The claimant is a member of the C--Unemployment Association,which was founded on 10th January, 1936. By the end of the first week of its existence the Association numbered 80 members. By September of that year its membership had risen to nearly 500.The rules of the Association provide for the payment by its members of a contribution of id. a week. No provision is made in the rules for the collection of subscriptions.For the first three weeks of the Association^ existence the collection of contributions was undertaken as a voluntary service by members of the Association. A resolution was then passed that &quot; we engage two collectors each Friday. We pay them 2s. each week and stamp their cards &quot;. An advertisement was then issued in these terms &quot; Any men wanting stamp contributions to give their names for collecting, and the neediest cases will be employed by the Committee &quot;.A rota of the members desiring to be employed as collectors was then compiled, and from it members of the Association were selected to collect contributions; the intention being that the employment of any particular member should cease as soon as he had acquired sufficient unemployment contributions to enable him to qualify for the receipt of unemployment benefit.Two men were employed each Friday for the purpose of collecting con-tributions and they were paid 2s. for their day&apos;s work and their unemploy-ment book and National Health Insurance Card were stamped by the Association.It is not suggested that an excessive number of men were employed for the purpose.The claimant was one of the first men so to be employed. He had had no regular employment for a considerable period, and he did not fulfil the requirements of the first statutory condition for the receipt of benefit. He was not in receipt of unemployment assistance as a &quot; nil determina-tion &quot; was in force in respect of him.As soon as he had served as a collector for 30 weeks he made a claim for unemployment benefit, which was disallowed by the Insurance Officer on the ground that the contributions paid in respect of his employment from 31st January to 21st August, 1936, were not paid in respect of bona fide employment. This decision was (by a majority) upheld by the Court of Referees.Section 22 (2) of the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1935, enacts that &quot; In determining whether an insured contributor has proved that the first statutory condition is fulfilled in his case, no account shall be taken of any contributions paid in respect of him for any period during which he was not bona fide employed &quot;.The corresponding section of an earlier Act was considered in Decision 18962/30 wherein it was said that the test for determining the bona fides of the unemployment is: was the employment a sham employment in the sense that the services of the employee were not required, or were the
(48oSh--nt)   Wt. 1907-3017   ao, 75   2/38   H. St.   G. 330services genuinely required? It was pointed out in the latter event the fact that the employment had been given to the claimant in preference to somebody else in order that the claimant might qualify for the receipt of benefit is immaterial.As was said by Lord Watson in Allen v. Flood: &quot; It is alike consistent with reason and common sense that when the act done is, apart from the feelings which prompted it, legal the civil law ought to take no recognisance of its motive &quot;.In the present case, from the fact that for the first three weeks of the Association^ existence the collection of subscriptions was undertaken voluntarily by the members, it appears that it was necessary to engage the services of someone for this work.The fact that these voluntary collectors were not receiving a money payment does not prevent their being employed under a contract of service, nor does it necessarily render their employment non-insurable (see paragraph i of Part I of the First Schedule to the Unemployment insurance Act, 1935).For these reasons I agree with the view expressed by the dissenting member of the Court of Referees that the claimant&apos;s employment in question was not sham employment, but was bona fide employment given to the claimant for the purpose of enabling him to qualify for the receipt of unemployment benefit, and, as I have previously stated, in the circum-stances the motive for employing the claimant is not material.(Signed)   Ernest W. Wingate-Saul,Umpire.r6th November, 1936.
