Paper No. 1399-B.)(Previous Reference : 303rd Meeting, Minute 1.)THE COMMITTEE had under consideration a Report by the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee on the Defence of Egypt, arising from two telegrams from His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Egypt, together with a telegram from the General Officer Commanding British Troops in Egypt, in which a demand had been made for the despatch of further reinforcements with a view to making Egypt as self-sufficient as possible in respect of defence (C.I.D. Paper No. 1399-B).LORD CHATFIELD, introducing the Report, recalled that the question of the defence of Egypt had been under consideration at the 301st and 303rd Meetings of the Committee of Imperial Defence, as a result of which certain steps had been taken to increase our forces in that country. He then outlined the main points of the Report by the Chiefs of Staff. The question as to whether the measures proposed by the Chiefs of Staff in paragraphs 15 and 16 should be adopted depended largely upon political considerations, as outlined in para-graphs 7 to 13. The crux of the question was whether the advantages of increasing our forces in Egypt were outweighed by the disadvantages of denuding our strength at home at the present time. It was, in fact, a question of balancing risks.LORD ZETLAND welcomed the conclusions of the Chiefs of Staff. He had for some time been anxious, to see our position in the Mediterranean and Middle East re-established. He enquired how soon the reserves of guns, armaments, vehicles, stores and anti-gas equipment, referred to in paragraph 4 of the Report, would be completed.&apos; LORD GORT replied that every effort was being made, and that some of the -reserves required by Egypt would be completed comparatively soon. We were, however, extremely short of reserves of all types of equipment at home.SIR CYRIL NEWALL said that, as regards air forces, the effect of the proposals of the Chiefs of Staff would be to increase the existing air strength in[16727-1] b
2Egypt by the equivalent of three fighter squadrons^ one medium bomber squadron and two light bomber squadrons. The two latter were of limited value in England, owing to their comparatively short range, but would be of considerable value in Egypt for attacking ground troops. In addition, five squadrons in the Middle East were now in process of re-equipment. If all the measures proposed were approved, the total air forces in Egypt would in the aggregate be only one squadron short of the total asked for by the Local Authorities. As regards accommodation, some of the additional squadrons could be housed at existing stations, while the remainder would be in huts or under canvas.LORD CHATFIELD, in reply to a question by Sir Thomas Inskip as to the precise implications of Sir Miles Lampson&apos;s plea for &quot; self-sufficiency &quot; in Egypt, thought that Sir Miles had in mind the existing emergency, as repre-sented by the Italian concentration in Libya. His object was to make it reasonably certain that the garrison of Egypt could hold out until reinforcements could reach them, even if they had to be routed via the Cape.SIR THOMAS INSKIP said that, in fact, therefore, &quot;self-sufficiency&quot; meant the provision of defences which would enable Egypt to hold out for at least 60 days.LORD CHATEIELD said that there was a further point on the question of reinforcements. If the additional forces now proposed were stationed in Egypt in peace time, it would always be possible for a certain proportion to be sent back to the United Kingdom if the situation in the Mediterranean were to clear up, or, alternatively, if the situation at home vis-a-vis Germany were to deteriorate. It would, however, be far more difficult to get reinforcements out to Egypt once an emergency had arisen.SIR JOHN SIMON thought that the proposals now before the Committee involved questions of high policy which, in his view, should be dealt with by the Cabinet. He recalled that when the measures for improving our position in Egypt had been previously discussed, the Prime Minister had made special arrangements and had himself taken the Chair. One important point, for instance, to be considered was the effect which the adoption of the proposals of the Chiefs of Staff would have on the impending negotiations with Italy.Turning to Appendices I and II of the Report,, it was noticeable that in his telegram of the 18th December the Ambassador stated that the Air Officer Commanding &quot; is satisfied with measures taken to meet his minimum require-ments &apos;&apos;; whereas in his telegram of the 22nd January there is a reference to &quot; fresh circumstances.&quot; and the strongest representations for further air reinforcements. This rapid change of view was presumably the result of a study of the Report by the Chiefs of Staff. It was also to be noted that Sir Miles Lampson had discussed our present relative air inferiority in Egypt, compared to the Italian strength, with the Egyptian Prime Minister, and had informed him that &quot;he would be making serious recommendations to His Majesty&apos;s Government with a view to strengthening the means of defence at disposal of R.A.F. against Italian air attack.&quot; This communication was a matter for serious concern. In any event, the satisfaction with the situation expressed in December was hardly compatible with the extreme apprehension evinced in January.Mr. ORMSBY GORE suggested that there were two new factors to be taken into account. In the first place, there was the fall of our friends, the Nahas Government. Secondly, there was the &apos;&apos; splash &apos;&apos; now being made by the Italians in that part of the world. In these circumstances, it was important that we should make a show of strength in the Eastern Mediterranean. The movement of a brigade to Palestine could easily be justified on the grounds of the unsettled state of that country.LORD CHATFIELD said that during the, autumn of 1938 the High Commissioner had expressed himself in strong terms as to the weakness of our position in Egypt. At. that time,, both the Committee of Imperial Defence, and the. Chiefs of Staff had felt.that tjie weakness of our position at home precluded the despatch of reinforcements; moreover, there seemed no immediate danger, of an Italian threat to Egypt. Since then, however, the Italian threat had become more imminent, and; in addition,&apos;-the Chiefs: of Staff; had been able;to undertake
a further examination of the problem in the course of their preparation of a comprehensive review of the situation in the Mediterranean and Middle East. As a result, they had somewhat altered their original view, and they now felt that the risks attending the despatch of forces to Egypt from this country should on balance be accepted.Mr. MALCOLM MacDONALD said that in his view there were two factors affecting the proposals. The first was the change of Government which had recently taken place in Egypt. If we were now to strengthen our military position in that country, there was a likelihood that the new Government would be kept within our orbit. The second point to be considered was the effect of the despatch of reinforcements on the impending negotiations with Italy.SIR ROBERT VANSITTART considered that the strengthening of our defensive position in Egypt would exercise an excellent effect on the negotiations, and for this reason alone, the proposals of the Chiefs of Staff were most welcome to the Foreign Office. There was no doubt that the situation had deteriorated, and that the Italians were now under our very eyes taking the same preliminary steps in Libya which they, had done in North-east Africa prior to attacking Abyssinia. The acquiescent attitude of Mussolini to the recent events in Austria was significant.(Sir John Simon left the meeting at this point.)Mr. HORE-BELISHA said that the establishment of a Middle East reserve would be in conformity with the new policy regarding the role of the British Army. In the Eastern Mediterranean the air situation was of great importance and this led to the conclusion that we required strong air forces in Egypt backed up by adequate mechanised units. One important point in connection with the despatch of reinforcements to the Middle East was the question of accommoda-tion. The existing garrison of Palestine were extremely badly off in this respect; and, if it were decided to despatch further troops to that area, decent accommocla-tion should be put in hand forthwith.Mr. ORMSBY GORE remarked that the cost of the existing troops in Palestine had so far fallen on the rapidly diminishing funds of that country. It was fully realised in the Colonial Office that the accommodation question was a difficult one, but if a Middle East reserve were stationed in Palestine for the purpose, if the-need arose, of reinforcing Egypt, it wnuld be most unreasonable to expect the Government of Palestine to pay for them. The Colonial Office v-ould willingly co-operate to the best of their power in finding a solution to the problem of accommodation.Mr. HORE-BELISHA said that the tendency to despatch troops here, there and everywhere at the shortest possible notice without regard to how they could be accommodated, was very much to be deprecated. For example, 25 per cent, of the troops recently despatched at short notice to Trinidad had become the victims of malaria, which might affect their health for the rest of their lives.SIR THOMAS INSKIP enquired whether it would, in fact, be possible to send the troops to the Middle East until accommodation had been arranged.LORD GORT said that two-thirds of the existing garrison in Palestine were in billets, which was an extremely bad arrangement from every point of view. The only solution which could be provided within a reasonable space of time would be to build hutted camps; and this would take three or four months to complete, and would cost about  100,000.LORD SWINTON suggested that the troops might be accommodated in Egypt. A time-table might be prepared for the Cabinet showing how long it would take for the proposed reinforcements to be available in the&quot;Middle East, according as to whether they were stationed in Palestine, or alternatively in Egypt.Mr. ORMSBY GORE said that the existing accommodation available in Egypt was already strained to its utmost capacity.  This question of accommoda-tion had cropped up year after year, and it was time that it was squarely faced. [16727-1]    &apos; b 2
Mr. HORE-BELISHA emphasised that the movements now contemplated had an element of permanency, and should not be regarded merely as &quot; chess-board moves.&quot;It might be advisable to ask the Chiefs of Staff to report on the question of the establishment of a Middle East Reserve.Mr. ORMSBY GORE suggested that the arguments which had been used in the discussion reinforced the view which he had always held, that the importance of Cyprus as a potential base had consistently been overlooked; Cyprus held immense advantages over either Egypt or Palestine.SIR THOMAS INSKIP said that it appeared from the discussions that though these movements were designed to meet a particular emergency they were to result in the semi-permanent stationing of. additional military and air forces in the Middle East. If it were decided to send the reinforcements in question, it was obviously desirable that they should be despatched as soon as possible, conditional upon suitable accommodation being provided. As stated by the Chancellor of the Exchequer the decision on the main question must be taken by the Cabinet.LORD SWINTON said that he would like to draw attention to one point regarding the despatch of the additional air forces. A tendency had grown up to consider our Imperial air strength in terms of two separate elements, namely, a Metropolitan Air force and an Overseas Air force. This conception was entirely erroneous, and was liable to unfortunate political repercussions. He hoped that his colleagues would bear this in mind in any public pronouncements that they might make.As regards publicity, he (Lord Swinton) suggested that no announcement should be made until the moves had taken place.SIR THOMAS INSKIP enquired whether self-sufficiency would, in fact, be achieved by the measures proposed, or might there be a further call for more air forces and troops later on % In fact, was the proposed increase of strength to be regarded as a final arrangement or merely as an instalment ?LORD GORT said that the existing forces in Egypt, together with the reinforcements now proposed, could be regarded only as the irreducible minimum required to hold the position in Egypt. It was the intention to form a small mobile division from the mobile troops already in that country.Mr. HORE-BELISHA added that, as suggested in the memorandum which he had recently circulated to the Cabinet,* the ideal would be to station in Egypt and/or Palestine, an additional mobile division and one division.SIR ROBERT VANSITTART, in reply to a question by Sir Thomas Inskip, said that the limitations placed on our forces in Egypt under the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty did not come into force until we had moved to the canal zone.SIR THOMAS INSKIP, summing up, said that the Committee appeared to be agreed that the proposals put forward by the Chiefs of Staff should be approved, and that the reinforcements which they recommended should be despatched with the least possible delay, subject to the stipulation that suitable accommodation could be arranged.THE COMMITTEE expressed unanimous agreement with this summing up.Mr. BARLOW asked that it should be recorded in the minutes that the Chancellor of the Exchequer had not been present during the latter part of the discussion.Conclusions.The Committee of Imperial Defence agreed :  (i) To accept the Report by the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee (C.I.D. Paper No. 1399-B), and to recommend that effect should be given to the following proposals with the least possible delay, subject to the proviso that arrangements are made  for adequate  and  suitable* CP. 26 (38).

The Chancellor of the Exchequer, who had left the Meeting before the above conclusion was reached, asked that his position might be reserved.(ii) That there should be no publicity regarding the above moves until theyhad actually taken place, (iii) That the Report by the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee (C.I.D. Paper No. 1399-B), together with the foregoing record of the discussion thereon, should be submitted to the Cabinet for consideration, if possible, at the Meeting to be held next Wednesday, the 23rd February. ******2 Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1, February 17, 1938.

(Previous C.I.D. Papers Nos. 1372-B and 1397-B.)Report by the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee.1. WE have had under consideration two telegrams, dated the 18th December, 1937, and the 22nd January, 1938, from Sir Miles Lampson. His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Egypt, together with one&apos; dated the 21st January. 1938, from the General Officer Commanding British Troops in Egypt, in which a demand is made for still further reinforcements to be despatched to Egypt, as soon as possible, with a view to making the country as self-sufficient as possible in respect of Defence. These telegrams axe attached as Appendices I, II and III respectively.2. Before commenting on the telegrams we point out that we are already engaged in making important additions to the strength of our forces in Egypt. An anti-aircraft brigade and searchlight company is on the way; a light tank battalion is shortly to be despatched; we are now in process of rearming four of the bomber squadrons in the Middle East and Iraq with up-to-date types of medium bombers, and one bomber squadron with fighters capable of dealing with the Italian aircraft that may be used to attack Egypt.Army requirements.3. Sir Miles Lampson in his telegram No. 717, dated the 18th December, 1937, welcomed these measures, and said that the Air Officer Commanding was satisfied, but that the following army requirements remained outstanding : (a) Egypt signals to be raised to establishment approved by War Office under letter No. 20/SIGS/540 (A.G.I.), dated the 27th September, 1937.(6) Establishment of all units to be raised to war establishment, plus 10 per cent, in cases where this has not already been done.(c) Completion of reserves of guns, armaments, vehicles and stores.(d) Completion of provision of anti-gas equipment.(e) Provision of reserve M.T. Company.[16696] b
(/) Reinforcements (which must be so located as to be in action in Egypt within 14 days of opening of hostilities) as under : One field company R.E., one armoured car regiment, one infantry brigade, including one machine-gun battalion, all with the necessary signals, R.A.O.C., R.A.S.C. units.(g) General hospital and mobile ambulance convoy. 4.   We propose to deal seriatim with the above requirements. Signals.(a) The signals in Egypt will be up to establishment at the end of thistrooping season, except the Cable Section, which the General Officer Commanding British Troops in Egypt does not consider essential This situation is considered satisfactory.Establishments.(b) We consider that units at present forming part of the garrison of egypt should be brought up to their authorised establishment.Priority of reserves.(c) and (d) Egypt has priority for completion of reserves of guns, armaments,vehicles, stores and anti-gas equipment.Reserve M.T. Company.(e) The despatch of a reserve M.T. Company, which consists of 11 officers, 471 other ranks, and 148 lorries, is not recommended at this juncture. There are three lines of communication to the Western Desert from Alexandria rail, road and sea. It should be possible to implement the present road transport by arrangements to hire vehicles and drivers in an emergency in Egypt. The provision of personnel for a M.T. Company would seriously affect the mobilisation of the rest of the Army, and a number of civilian drivers would have to be engaged for normal peace-time duties in the United Kingdom. We have no lorries immediately available, unless 6-wheelers are sent, and these have proved unsuitable for use in Egypt. To meet this requirement 180 lorries would have to be purchased (i.e., 148, plus reserves), which would be delivered about July 1938, at &apos;a cost of  70,000, unless 140 lorries at-present on order for Palestine (due at the end of April) were diverted to Egypt. In an emergency we could probably find sufficient air transport from the Bomber Transport Squadrons and the resources of civil aviation in Africa and India to enable us adequately to supplement the normal channels of communications.Reinforcements.(/) We recommend that one infantry brigade and necessary ancillary troops should be despatched without delay to Palestine as a Middle East reserve, and one Field Company to Egypt. There are already two machine gun battalions in Palestine, so adjustment can be made locally to ensure a machine gun battalion being available if this reserve is used in Egypt. There is only one armoured car regiment in the United Kingdom and its cars are unsuitable for use in the desert; it is, moreover, a part of the Field Force. Egypt is being given priority in equipment and armament for mechanised units, including the armoured car regiment at present there. We do not think there is any object in sending out at present another armoured car regiment which would have obsolete cars.Medical units.(g) The question of the provision of extra medical units for Egypt is the subject of discussion between Egypt and the War Office. We are of the opinion that extra medicai personnel and equipment will be necessary.
Air Requirements.5. Turning to the demand for air reinforcement, Sir Miles Lampson and the Service Commanders press for the immediate reinforcement of the air forces in Egypt by a total of six squadrons, including three fighter squadrons; and  although they do not specifically say so they imply that this increase in strength should be in addition to the reinforcements earmarked to go to Egypt in the event of war, with the exception of the three fighter squadrons which were to go out in H.M.S. Furious.Sir Miles Lampson says he is &quot; more than ever convinced that self-sufficiency is the only means by which the security of Egypt can be fully ensured, and our obligations to the Egyptian Government under the Treaty adequately discharged.&quot;6. Sir Miles Lampson speaks of &quot; the fresh circumstances now revealed by the Chiefs of Staff,&quot; referring presumably to remarks which we recently drew up on a Combined Plan for the defence of Egypt, in which it was stated &quot; that the actual numerical strength of the air forces Italy would concentrate against Egypt might well be greater than that envisaged in the Combined Plan &quot; and that the &quot; 108 ground attack aircraft which Italy possesses are almost certain to be moved to Libya to support the land attack on Egypt.&quot;Actually these can scarcely be described as &quot; fresh circumstances &quot; since the actual strength and classes of the aircraft which we thought Italy might concentrate against Egypt were known to the local authorities in August 1937 prior to the preparation of the Combined Defence Plan.7. Nevertheless, we have every sympathy with the point of view of Sir Miles Lampson and the Service Commanderss in Egypt, and we fully understand that the situation there, and the great Italian concentration of strength on their western borders, must appear extremely menacing to the authorities in Egypt. Moreover, since the Combined Defence Scheme for Egypt was considered, the world situation has altered. The recent developments in the Far East may entail the despatch of the British Main Fleet to Singapore. The greater the tension in the Far East, the more important becomes the necessity for security in the Mediterranean. Recently persistent reports have been received that Italy intends to increase her forces in Libya by another corps, but we do not feel that the scale of land attack from Libya is likely to be increased. Administrative reasons will always limit the number of troops that can be maintained in the &quot;Western Desert. We also appreciate the Ambassadors difficulties in convincing the Egyptian Government that we are willing and able to implement our obligation under the Treaty, and we consider that as soon as the political situation in Europe permits we should increase the strength of our air forces in Egypt.In a later paragraph we make certain suggestions as to how the great disparity of strength between ourselves and the Italians might be reduced.8. The greatest potential menace to the security of the Empire as a whole is that of German attack on this country. Sir Miles Lampson, in his telegram of the 18th December, says that he realises &apos;&apos; that the despatch of the anti-aircraft brigade and R.A.F. replacements must have occasioned inconvenience and re-arrangement in the home defence programme.&quot; Actually the despatch of any air forces or anti-aircraft guns from this country involves far more than incon-venience or re-arrangement, and means the definite weakening of our already inadequate resources available in this country to act as a deterrent to German air attack, and to meet it if it does come.9. It may be argued that the risk of German attack is remote, and we do not ourselves consider it probable. On the other hand, it is not impossible within the next two years; and if Germany were intending to attack us or France, nothing-would suit her book better than to see us dissipating our already inadequate strength to meet a threat which indeed the Germans themselves may be largely instrumental in creating.10. This is one side of the picture. On the other hand the arguments on the other side are almost equally cogent. The Foreign Office in a Memorandum of the 15th June 1937 (C.I.D. Paper No. 1332-B), pointed out the temptation it would be to Germany to exploit our preoccupation in the Mediterranean to her own advantage and concluded that &apos;&apos; adequate preparation to resist presure from [16696] B 2
Italy, and consequently to prevent that pressure from being recklessly exercised, is an important, if indirect means of preventing a conflict between this country and Germany from breaking out.&quot;11. Aggravated by his difficulties in Abyssinia and in the financial and economic sphere, there is no doubt that Mussolini is suffering from a fear complex, and as only recently suggested by our Ambassador in Rome, it is not impossible that he may seek to precipitate a conflict before our rearmament is complete, and while we are likely to be involved in difficulties with the Arabs in the Middle East.12. There is, moreover, this very strong point. Any reverse in the Middle East at the hands of Italy might well precipitate a stream of reinforcements to the Mediterranean and consequently lead to a dangerous weakening of our position at home. We have suggested that it is not impossible that Germany might go to war within the next two years. But in our view she is extremely unlikely to start a war by aggression against ourselves or France, if she can avoid it. It appears much more likely that she would encourage Italy to get us seriously involved in the Middle East, and then exploit that situation and enter the war in her own time when we are fully committed in the Mediterranean. In other words, although the war is unlikely to last long as a single-handed war, it may very well start as such. In that event, we should not, in practice, if we were not actually at war with Germany, be able to refrain from sending reinforcements to Egypt. The result would be that, not only would they not be available in this country when war with Germany broke out, but when they would be most wanted in Egypt they would be at sea on the way out; and to reach Egypt they would either have to go through the Mediterranean with all its attendant risks, or go round the Cape, and in neither case would they be likely to reach Egypt at the time wrhen they would be most critically needed.It is also true that a force which would be relatively insignificant in its effects if kept at home would be of very definite value in the defence of Egypt.13. The decision as to whether or not reinforcements should be sent, and the strength of any that are sent, is therefore mainly dependent on political factors. If the danger of initial attack by Germany in the next two years is considered a real one, then we shall be wrong to do anything to weaken our defences in this country. If, on the other hand, war with Germany is more likely to arise as the result of a reverse in the Mediterranean, then we have no doubt that reinforcements should be sent to Egypt. It is a question of balancing risks, and in our view, from the military standpoint, the chances of an initial German attack on France or on this country within the next few years are not such as to justify us in declining to take some small risks at home in order to decrease the chances of an outbreak in the Middle East and strengthen our resources to deal with it if it does occur.14. The principle, therefore, which should govern the despatch of any forces to strengthen our position in Egypt should be (a) they should reduce as little as possible our strength at home relative to German attack;(&amp;) they should be strong enough to provide an added deterrent to Italian attack on Egypt; and(c) they should be of a type as far as possible suited to meet the most dangerous threat to Egypt, namely, an attempt at a rapid spectacular success by land invasion with powerful air support.Conclusions.We summarise our proposals as follows :  Army Proposals.15. We have already discussed the situation regarding the Army require-ments in paragraph 3 -above, and it..is-clear ... that, if the recommendations enumerated in paragraph 4 (b) and (/) above can be implemented, they should meet the requirements of the General Officer Commanding.   We do not consider
that the despatch of these reinforcements would weaken our ability to resist attack by Germany on this country, whereas they would materially assist towards making Egypt more &quot;self-sufficient&quot; against land attack. We therefore recommend that the forces mentioned in paragraph (4) (6) and (/) should be despatched, and that any extra medical units which may be found necessary should be included in those reinforcements.Air Proposals.16.   The measures which we propose are as follows : (a) One squadron of Fighters (Gladiators) to be despatched to Egypt atonce; this squadron&quot; and No. 33 Squadron, now in Egypt, to be brought up to establishment of 21 first-line aircraft each, with adequate reserves.(b) Twelve  first-line  medium  bombers  (Wellesleys)  with  the  necessarypersonnel and reserve aircraft to be despatched to Egypt at once, to increase the establishment of existing Wellesley Squadrons.(c) These to be followed as soon as possible by two squadrons of light bombers (Hinds) each with 12 first-line aircraft and the necessary reserves, for use primarily as ground attack aircraft.(d) It will not be possible to bring these squadrons up to full establishment in reserve aircraft until later in the summer of 1938.(e) The above two bomber squadrons will be replaced by forming newsquadrons in the Spring of 1939 equipped with an up-to-date type of bomber, and. stationed in the United Kingdom instead of at Hong Kong, where they are authorised to form in 1939-40. (/) The fighter squadron in (a) above will be regarded as a temporary reinforcement, and while it is retained in Egypt will be replaced in its sector of the aircraft fighting zone by a Field Force Fighter squadron.(g) The two Hind squadrons can only be provided with the necessary scale of reserves by rolling up an additional squadron. The net result, therefore, of the measures proposed will be : (i) The effective striking strength of Bomber Command will be reduced by three squadrons for a period of 12-18 months, i.e., until it is possible to form the two new squadrons and re-equip the Hind squadron which is rolled up.(ii) There will be one less fighter squadron in the United Kingdom, but the numbers permanently allotted to sectors in the aircraft-fighting zone will not be reduced.(h) Adequate transport of a suitable type should be provided at once toensure the requisite degree of mobility for the squadrons in the Middle East, and to provide for the supply and maintenance require-ments of the squadrons in the field.(i) Finally, it is proposed to increase temporarily the establishment of pilots and flying crews in all squadrons in the Middle East Command. Palestine and Iraq. This will form an immediate reserve of flying personnel which, together with the output of the Flying Training School in Egypt, will serve to replace personnel wastage in the early stages of a war.CHATFIELD.

APPENDIX. I.Copy of a telegram dated December 18, 1937 (No. 717), from Sir Miles Lampson(Cairo) to the Foreign Office.YOUR telegram No. 571.I greatly welcome the defence measures approved by His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment which go a long way towards relieving me of immediate anxiety. I particularly welcome despatch of anti-aircraft brigade and R.A.F. replacements, both of which I am well aware must have, occasioned inconvenience and re-arrangements in home defence programme.2. Air Officer Commanding is satisfied with measures taken to meet his minimum requirements and does not desire to press for any further reinforce-ments at present. General Officer Commanding states his outstanding require-ments remains substantially as stated in my telegram No. 635, namely : (1) Egypt signals to be raised to establishment approved by War Office under letter No. 20/SIGS/540 (A.G.1) dated the 27th September, 1937.(2) Establishment of all units to be raised to war establishment plus 10 per cent, in cases where this has not already been done.(3) Completion of reserves of guns, armaments, vehicles and stores.(4) Completion of provision of anti-gas equipment.(5) Provision of reserve M.T. Company.(6) Reinforcements (which&apos; must be so located as to be in action in Egypt within 14 days of opening of hostilities) as under.One field company R.E., one armoured car regiment, one infantry brigade, including one machine gun battalion, all with the necessarv signals. R.A.O.C., R.A.S.C. units.General hospital and mobile ambulance convoy. He is writing to the War Office in the above sense by bag the 18th December.3. I would most strongly urge that effect should be given forthwith to the General Officer Commanding&quot;s recommendations in regard to the above. I attach particular importance to early despatch of reinforcements referred to in item 6, without which security of Egypt cannot be assured. I further trust difficulty of sending out reinforcements by fast convoyr through the Mediterranean has led to the abandonment of that proposal, and that arrangements will be made to station the above troops in Palestine in accordance with my previous recommendations. This is in any way essential if General Officer Commanding&apos;s requirements that they should be available within 14 days of the opening of hostilities is to be met. When reinforcements arrive it should be fully understood that they will be at the complete disposal of General Officer Commanding British Troops in Egypt in the event of external attack, and that they cannot be employed for the purposes of internal security, e.g., protection of lines of communication in Palestine.APPENDIX II.Copy of a telegram dated January 22, 1938, from His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador,Cairo, to the foreign Office.(No. 49.)PLEASE see telegram No. 5299* from local service commanders to Chief of Staff in London of the 21st January, which reports presentation of abridged defence plan to the Prime Minister. Copy of plan went by bag to-day, together with report of conversation with Prime Minister thereon.2. In the light of facts revealed in Chiefs of Staffs memorandumt of the 22nd December (your despatch .No. 1482), local commanders now strongly recommend increase of air reinforcements by three squadrons in addition to the* Reproduced as Appendix III.t Paper No. C.O.S. 660.
three fighter squadrons at present earmarked for despatch on outbreak, of hostilities in H.M.S. &quot; Furious &quot; convoy. They also urge most strongly that in view of grave risk inherent in passage of H.M.S. &quot; Furious &quot; through Mediter-ranean and cargoes of aeroplanes at Alexandria, the three fighter squadrons now detailed to be brought out in H.M.S. &quot; Furious &quot; should also be stationed forth-with in the Near East.3. I most urgently endorse the above recommendations. Having in mind the ease with which Italy can reinforce her air forces in Libya, I have always felt that in addition to re-equipment of R.A.F. units already in Egypt a permanent increase to our air forces was essential (in this connexion please see paragraph 6 of my telegram* No. 635 of the 12th November, in which I advocated despatch of three additional R.A.F. squadrons). The fresh circumstances now revealed by Chiefs of Staff make such an increase doubly important. I have also constantly stressed my anxiety in regard to reliance on convoys to supply reinforcements which would be vitally needed immediately upon outbreak of hostilities. I am more than ever convinced that self-sufficiency is the only means by which security of Egypt can be fully ensured and our obligations to Egyptian Government under treaty adequately discharged. As reported in telegram from local commanders our present relative air inferiority in Egypt, compared to Italians, could not be concealed from the Prime Minister, and with a view to allaying his natural anxiety I assured him that I would be making serious recommendation to His Majesty&apos;s Government with a view to strengthening means of defence at disposal of R.A.F. against Italian air attack. He asked me to emphasise his keen anxiety. I have no hesitation in urging with all insistence that every effort be made to meet present recommendation of local commanders in regard to air reinforcements. Even if all six new squadrons now asked for were stationed in Egypt I understand treaty figure of 400 pilots would not be exceeded.4. The same considerations apply to land reinforcements referred to in paragraph 4 of local commander&apos;s telegram. In my telegram No. 7l7t of the 18th December, I begged that General Officer Commanding&apos;s outstanding require-ments therein should be met forthwith, the most essential being provision of reserve mechanical transport company and despatch to Palestine forthwith of an infantry brigade and a field company of Royal Engineers without which reinforce-ments the General Officer Commanding cannot guarantee to hold out for longer than fourteen days. I most earnestly beg that in drawing up appreciation of Mediterranean situation referred to in paragraph 3 of Chiefs of Staffs memorandum of the 22nd December full provision will be made for all above requirements.APPENDIX III.Copy of a telegram, dated January 21, 1938, from General Officer Commanding,Egypt, to the Service Departments.FOLLOWING for Chief of Imperial General Staff, Chief of Naval Staff, Chief of Air Staff. Reference Paper No. C.O.S. 660, dated the 22nd December. Abridged plan was submitted to Prime Minister at an informal discussion on the 19th January.  For the present Marshal Cornwall was not invited.Preliminary results as regards our requirements from Egyptian Government were favourable, but final decision cannot be expected until Egyptian Government has had time to study plan.2. The plan handed to Egyptians is so abridged that a Secret Supplement would in the end have to be a complete plan. It is proposed, therefore, that original combined plan, amended in the light of Paper No. C.O.S. 660 and new units and equipment which have been approved, should take the place of secret supplement and be called full combined plan. It is not proposed to forward this revised full combined plan at this stage as Admiralty amendment(s) may be necessary when appreciation referred to in paragraph 3 of Paper No. C.O.S 660* Appendix I to Paper No. CCS. 646.f Appendix I.
is received and Egyptian comments on abridged plans are received. In view of paragraphs 14 to 18, inclusive (in particular paragraph 17), local commanders consider available defence against Italian air attack to be inadequate, and that information in paragraph 17 introduces a new factor which threatens the successful operation of land forces.They therefore recommend that there should be available in initial stages of hostilities three additional squadrons. Egyptian Prime Minister was undoubtedly perturbed at strength of our air forces relative to Italian. Provision of these additional squadrons, which are in addition to those now arranged to be brought in Furious, would go a long way to relieve his justified anxiety.Apart from grave risk inherent in the passage of Furious through Medi-terranean, there would be great danger to her cargo whilst it was being disem-barked at Alexandria, and Local Commanders urge most strongly that three fighter squadrons now suggested be brought in Furious should also be stationed in Near East as this is only way in which it can be made certain that they will be available from very beginning of hostilities.4. It is also considered essential that additional land forces as requested by C.R. Egypt 96688 (g) dated 18/12 should be available.5. Local Commanders also recommend relief Cyprus before outbreak of war as it will be particularly required in first few days.6. Reference annex No. 1 to C.R.O.&apos;s 0660, paragraph 6 (F), Local Commanders, after consultation with Ambassador, do not consider formal sub-mission of plan by Egyptian Government either necessary or desirable, and unless otherwise ordered propose to submit the abridged plan as soon as it has been accepted by Egyptian Government. This may take some weeks, by which time it is hoped full combined plan referred to in paragraph 2 above may be ready. His Majesty&apos;s Government would then, when giving their decisions, be in possession of both full and abridged plans.7. The question whether the three additional squadrons asked for in para-graph 3 should be bombers or fighters has purposely been left open until return to Cairo of A.O.C., Middle East, on Tuesday, the 25th January.
