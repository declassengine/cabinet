Notes of the Conversation between the Chancellor and the British Ambassador in the Presence of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Herr von Ribbentrop, on March 3, 1938, in Berlin.THE BRITISH AMBASSADOR began by emphasising the confidential character of the conversation. A communication in general terms was being com-municated to the French and something even more general to the Belgians, Portuguese and Italians, who were being informed that this conversation, in continuation of the talks between Lord Halifax and the Chancellor, was concerned with the questions at issue between Germany and England.He (Sir Nevile Henderson) wished to make it clear that this conversation was, on the one hand, an attempt to explain the broad lines on which the British Government sought a solution and, if possible, to learn, on the other, from the Chancellor the German view thereof; he added that he was, of course, only speaking for the British Government, which desired, in the first place, to clear up the situation for itself before getting into touch with other Powers in regard to the execution of its proposals. On this ground the conversation must be regarded as confidential vis-a-vis of other Powers.He wished particularly to emphasise the fact that there was no question of a bargain, but rather of an attempt to create the basis for a real and sincere friend-ship with Germany beginning with an improvement of the atmosphere and ending with the creation of a new spirit of friendly understanding. Without under-estimating the difficulties to be overcome, the British Government believed that the moment was favourable for such an attempt to improve their mutual relations. This attempt must, however, fail if both parties did not make their contribution towards agreement; that is to say, if an agreement was reached, it could only be on the basis of reciprocity. The positive co-operation of Germany in the establish-ment of order and security in Europe was essential. As had been said in the course of Lord Halifax&apos;s conversation, it was necessary that a solution should be found on the basis of higher reason rather than on that of the free interplay of force. Lord Halifax had stated that changes in Europe might be regarded as possible, but these changes should be brought about in the spirit of higher reason referred to above. The object of the English proposals was to contribute to a settlement on this basis of reason, i.e.., reasonable solutions reasonably achieved.After the British Ambassador had made these personal observations, he proceeded to speak in the sense of his instructions. He stated that during his recent visit to London he had discussed with the Prime Minister and other members of the Cabinet concerned all the questions arising out of Lord Halifax&apos;s visit to Germany. In this connexion he emphasised the importance of German co-operation towards the pacification of Europe, to which he had already drawn attention in earlier conversations with Herr von Neurath and Herr von Ribbentrop. This work of pacification could be furthered by limitation of armaments and by peace in Czechoslovakia and Austria. In this last connexion the British Ambassador read the following- instructions, of which he subsequently handed over a written copy : &quot; In our view appeasement would be dependent, amongst other things, on the measures taken to inspire confidence in Austria and Czechoslovakia. His Majesty&apos;s Government at present cannot estimate the effect of the recent arrangement between Germany and Austria, which must depend upon the manner in which the several undertakings of arrangements made are implemented by the two parties to them. They are therefore at present doubtful as to the effects which these arrangements are likely to have on the situation in Central Europe and cannot conceal from themselves that recent events have aroused apprehension in many quarters which must inevitably render more difficult the negotiation of a general settlement.&quot;As regards the limitation of armaments, Sir Nevile Henderson remarked that the British Government were well aware of the difficulties especially if treated as a general question, but he recalled the proposal of the Chancellor with regard to the prohibition of bombing. The British Government warmly welcomed a proposal of this nature. It regarded, however, as still more important, a limita-tion of bombing aeroplanes. In the light of the German proposals made two years ago, the English Government was once more examining this question and hoped to be able to put forward acceptable proposals. It would be interesting to have the German views on this question.
As regards colonies, the British Ambassador stated that the British Govern-ment was sincerely ready not only to examine the colonial question, but also to make progress towards its solution. The Prime Minister had devoted his personal attention to this matter. Here also the difficulties were naturally great, in view of the fact that twenty years had passed since the last redistribution of colonial territory. Moreover, public opinion in England was particularly sensitive on this point. The British Ambassador then read the following proposal in regard to the colonial question, of which he handed over a copy after the conversation : &quot; A solution which seemed to them to have many attractions might be found in a scheme based upon the idea of a new regime of colonial adminis-tration in a given area of Africa, roughly corresponding to the conventional zone of the Congo Basin Treaties, acceptable and applicable to all the Powers concerned on exactly equal terms.&quot; Each Power, while solely concerned for the administration of its own territories, would be invited to subscribe to certain principles designed to promote the well-being of all.&quot; For instance, there would be the question of demilitarisation as well as stipulations for the welfare of the natives, and for freedom of trade and com-munications. Also, perhaps a commission might be formed consisting of representatives of all the Powers having territory in the area covered by the new arrangements.&quot;He mentioned, when reading this proposal, that the territory in question could be taken as bounded in the north by a line approximately 50 latitude and on the south approximately by the Zambesi River. He added that a commission would possibly be foi-med of those Powers who possessed colonial territory within this area.  Finally, he put to the Chancellor the questions whether Germany (1) was ready in principle to take part in a new colonial regime as outlined in the English proposal, and (2) what contribution she was ready to make for general order and security in Europe.THE CHANCELLOR answered that the most important contribution to the establishment of order and security in Europe would be the prohibition of the international incitement of the press (&quot; Hetzpresse &quot;), since nothing threatened security so much as the intrigues of these organs of the press, which unfortunately were very numerously represented also in England. He mentioned that he person-ally was known as one of the warmest friends of England, but that, he held been ill-requited for this friendship. It was probably true to say that no one had been more often and more heavily attacked by England than himself. It was therefore comprehensible that he should now have withdrawn into a certain isolation which appeared to him more dignified than making advances to some one who did not want him and who always repulsed him.In reply to a retort from the British Ambassador that he had only been repulsed by certain circles in England, the Chancellor l-eplied that the British Government must have been able, if it so desired, to influence the press in another direction. They had in Germany information from friends in England which went to show that the press had been influenced in the sense of which he com-plained by official English circles. The very first condition for a pacification of the atmosphere was a cessation of the campaign in the press.As regards Central Europe, it must be said that Germany would not allow third parties to interfere in the settlement of her relationship with countries of the same nationality or countries with large German populations, just as Germany had no idea of wishing to interfere in the settlement of the relations between England and Ireland. It was a question of preventing an injustice to millions of Germans from being continued or once more resumed. On the occasion of this attempt to reach a settlement, Germany must most earnestly declare that she is not prepared to allow herself to be influenced from other quarters in this settle-ment. It was impossible that the freedom of the nations and democratic rights should be always represented on one hand as elements of European order, but that precisely the opposite.should be maintained when it was a question of improving the lot of the Germans in Austria, where a Government, which, unlike the German [16823] B 2
Government, had not come to power by legal means and only had 15 per cent, of the population behind it, had oppressed the remaining Germans. This was an impossible situation in the long run, and if England continued to oppose German efforts to reach a just and reasonable settlement, the moment would come when it would be necessary to fight. When he endeavoured, as he had done in Berchtesgaden, to obtain by peaceful means alleviation for the oppressed Germans, Paris and London not only viewed his efforts with complete scepticism, but instructed their diplomatic representatives to impede the execution of this peaceful effort (the British Ambassador interjected that England had never done this), and thus rendered a very bad service to peace. In the last resort, the Austrian people must themselves be asked for their opinion, and in Czechoslovakia the Germans must be guaranteed the autonomy in cultural and other matters to which they were entitled, in order here to reach a satisfactory solution. This was the simplest application of that right of self-determination of the nations which had played so great a role in Wilson&apos;s Fourteen Points. The present situation was in any case impossible in the long run. and would lead to an explosion. In order to avoid this, the agreements of Berchtesgaden had been concluded, and it could be said that the difficulties might be regarded as removed if the Austrian Government carried out their undertakings. Whosoever proceeded with force against reason and justice called force on to the stage, as he had said in his Reichstag speech.In reply to a question from the British Ambassador as to whether Germany wras seeking a plebiscite in Austria, the Chancellor replied that he demanded that by a process of evolution the just interests of the German Austrians should be secured and an end made to oppression.THE BRITISH AMBASSADOR pointed out that the present English Government had a strong sense of realities. Mr. Chamberlain himself had taken over the leadership of the people, instead of letting himself be led by them. He had displayed great courage in deliberately exposing the impracticability of certain international phrases, such as collective security and the like, by which the British public had long been hypnotised. History showed that seldom had anything been more difficult than to find two men who not only wanted the same thing, but, above all, meant to carry it out at the same moment. For this reason England had declared her readiness to clear up the difficulties, and she now put to Germany the question whether she, too, on her side was ready.THE CHANCELLOR referred to the proposals he had made years ago. The answer had been the Franco-Russian Pact, which had subsequently become particularly dangerous for Germany by the accession of Czechoslovakia. As a consequence of this pact the industrial areas on the borders of the Reich in the Ruhr and in Saxony were exposed to the gravest threat, and on either side the enemy was in a position to stab Germany to the heart. On the German side they had therefore been obliged to take thorough steps to protect themselves against this ring. The limitation of armaments was accordingly in essentials dependent on Soviet Russia. A recent speech of VoroshilofPs had once again made it perfectly clear what was to be expected from that quarter; he had plainly announced that Soviet forces would make ruthless use of poison gas. Here was the necessity for Germany to be armed. She was not arming against England, and he referred in this connexion to the Naval Agreement. The problem was made particularly difficult by the fact that one could place as much confidence in the faith in treaties of a barbarous creature like the Soviet Union as in the comprehension of a savage for mathematical formulae. Agreements with this country were accordingly as good as worthless. Soviet Russia should never have been allowed into Europe. He, the Chancellor, had in his earlier proposals envisaged a European regime without Russia.In reply to a question of the British Ambassador,, as to whether Germany would be ready to agree to a prohibition of. bombing, the Chancellor replied that he had already long ago made known his standpoint on this question, and to-day he could only&quot; add that Germany would not again allow herself to be cheated by empty promises as once with Wilson&apos;s Fourteen Points. If the Soviet Union Avere to-day to declare its readiness to refrain from the use of poison gais bombs, it would be impossible to place any1 faith in such a declaration. *:
In reply to an observation of the Ambassador that at present the only subject of discussion was England&apos;s relation to Germany, the Chancellor retorted that England need fear no trouble from Germany. Germany was not intervening in the affairs of the Empire; but it was her experience that England reacted negatively when Germany took steps to solve her difficulties. The English &quot; No &quot; confronted an attempt at solution in the East as much as a demand for colonies, and everywhere the English press went out of its way to stand in Germany&apos;s path and carry on a campaign of defamation against this country.THE BRITISH AMBASSADOR replied that the blame for the appearance of false news in the press was attributable not only to the English side; the effect of the German press censorship was to create numerous false reports, and, moreover, sharp attacks against England had been carried on in the German press, particularly at the time of his assumption of office.In reply the CHANCELLOR pointed out that for three years, from 1933 to 1936, complete silence had been observed in Germany in the face of all English attacks. But whereas Germany had never intervened in internal English affairs, Ireland, &amp;c, English attempts at intervention on the part of the bishops, certain Members of Parliament and other quarters had continued uninterruptedly.THE BRITISH AMBASSADOR, mentioned confidentially in this connexion that Lord Halifax proposed shortly to hold a conference of responsible newspaper publishers, and was also having a discussion with the president of the Institute of Newspaper Publishers and leading personalities of English broadcasting. In the course of these discussions he meant once more to emphasise the responsibility for peace resting on men in these positions. The Prime Minister had also spoken once again recently in the House of Commons on the subject. The freedom of the English press made it impossible to do more and what was now being done was in fact unprecedented. It was, however, notable that the new British Foreign Minister, who on account of his conversations in Germany had an excellent knowledge of the German attitude, had already made his influence strongly felt in this matter as in others, and that in the way which in England was the only possible one, namely, by personal contact. As an example that, after all, errors about English concerns could arise in German quarters, the British Ambassador referred to the false German view that the Vansittart Committee stood behind the wave of anti-German propaganda. He could give his word of honour that this committee had not had the slightest connexion with the issue of false reports. The committee was in no sense an instrument of propaganda directed against other countries, but was designed solely to do propaganda for England and the British Empire.THE FOREIGN MINISTER, Herr von Ribbentrop, referred in this con-nexion to the fortnights campaign of lies conducted by Reuters. None of those responsible for the false news had been dismissed or even warned. Some system must after all be concealed in the background.THE CHANCELLOR took note of the British Ambassadors fresh assurance about the Vansittart Committee (the latter declared that the committee had not as yet even begun its work) and summed up by saying that the determining factor in any improvement in the situation would be better instruction of the press and a cessation of sensational attacks and stories in favour of greater objectivity.In reply to a question of the Chancellors with regard to the new colonial regime, the BRITISH AMBASSADOR stated, pointing to a globe, that the British Government envisaged a system on the same lines as the Berlin Act of 1885 (the Congo Acts). The colonies in the area, of Africa to be delimited were to be redistributed. In this redistribution Germany&apos;s claims would be considered and she would have in this event a colonial territory under her own sovereignty. All the Powers with colonies in this Central African territory would nevertheless have to undertake specific obligations in 1&apos;egard to demilitarisation, freedom of trade and treatment of the natives.THE CHANCELLOR replied that Germany was naturally interested above all in the question of. what was to happen to her former colonies. . Under the proposed arrangement what part exactly would she get?   All depended on that.
Instead of creating a complicated new system, why not solve the colonial question in the simplest and most natural way by giving back the former German colonies ? He, the Chancellor, must nevertheless openly admit here that he did not consider the colonial question ripe for solution, since Paris and London had set themselves too strongly and definitely against a return. For this reason he did not want to press the question. They could easily wait four, six, eight or ten years. Perhaps by that time there would be a change of heart in Paris and London and they would see that the best solution was to give back to Germany that which was by purchase and treaty her rightful property. The condition for the co-operation of Germany in a new colonial regime was therefore the return of her rightly obtained former colonies which had been taken away by treaty. Germany did not wish to trouble with the colonial problem other States who were not concerned. Perhaps Belgium and Portugal would not agree and perhaps they would think that Germany was demanding something from them to which she was not entitled. &quot;THE BRITISH AMBASSADOR again explained the English colonial plan on the globe, and in doing so Sir Nevile Henderson stated in answer to a question of the Chancellor that he believed that Portugal and Belgium, and in the end France and Italy as well, would co-operate in the solution. In reply to a question of Herr von Ribbentvop&apos;s as to whether the British Government intended to restrict the satisfaction of Germany^ colonial claims solely to the area in question, the British Ambassador replied that the Congo Basin proposal did not exclude the possibility of the restoration of former German colonial territory outside that area.The conversation then returned to Central European problems, and upon a remark of the British Ambassador that Mr. Chamberlain could only achieve some-thing if Germany made some contribution in this field, the CHANCELLOR replied that his contribution to these questions was to be seen in the Berchtesgaden agreement with Austria, but that he must&apos;state with all emphasis that, if ever there was shooting at Germans in Austria or Czechoslovakia, the German Reich would be at hand. He, the Chancellor, had had to do a great deal of speech-making in his political career and some people therefore perhaps thought that they need not take his words too seriously. They would, however, make a bloody mistake if they were to take his statements on Central European questions as pure rhetoric. If in Austria or in Czechoslovakia internal explosions took place, Germany would not remain neutral, but would act like lightning. It was there-fore wrong for certain diplomats or for certain people in the Vienna Government to say they need not be af raid and need not implement their obligations too exactly. Herr von Ribbentrop here referred to what he described as the dramatic interview between the British Minister in Vienna and Herr von Papen, in the course of which the Minister protested most warmly against the pressure which Germany was alleged to have exercised upon Austria. All tne pressure at Berchtesgaden had consisted in pointing out to Austria certain dangers and suggesting a solution to deal with them. If the British Minister had protested so dramatically to Herr von Papen, how must he have spoken to the Austrian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Dr. Schmidt?The Chancellor continued that certain things were intolerable for a Great Power. England declared that she could not permit an attack upon Belgium or Holland. On his side, he, the Chancellor, declared just as emphatically that if Germans were oppressed in Central Europe in the same or in other ways, then Germany must and would intervene.&apos; THE BRITISH AMBASSADOR recapitulated the German point of view with regard to Austria and Czechoslovakia, by saying he understood it to be to the effect that in the case of further oppression of the Germans living there, there would be an explosion, but that, on the other hand, if they were accorded complete equality of rights no conflict need be anticipated.On the question of the limitation of air armaments, the CHANCELLOR observed that in this matter naturally there could be no question of disarmament being confined to particular areas of the world since the air arm was particularly mobile. An air force from the Far East could, for example, easily be employed in Europe. No territorial limitations could therefore be taken into account. He, the Chancellor, for his part had made his proposals with the thought in mind that according to the Geneva Convention war against non-combatants was\IV :?.\I) -
forbidden. Unfortunately his proposals had not been adopted. The British Ambassador replied that the British Government might well have hesitated earlier to take up the prohibition of bombing, but that it now took a different point of view provided there were an international agreement to that effect. Sir Nevile Henderson added, in conclusion, that the moment for a discussion of armaments was favourable for several reasons. Germany was strong, but England was strong again, too. Germany had awoken England from her slumber, so that neither party to the negotiations could imagine that they were being undertaken from fear or weakness. He, the Ambassador, agreed with Field-Marshal Goring in thinking that only negotiations between the strong promised success. On the other hand, much money was being spent on armament, so that there was a direct interest in limitation. The Chancellor replied that German armaments were conditioned by Russia. It was a question of life or death for Germany to defend her position in Central Europe and she must arm herself against an attack from Soviet Russia, which could naturally never be held up by the border States and Poland. In an armaments discussion the British must therefore start with Russia.In reply to a further question of the British Ambassadors as to the German attitude to the English colonial proposals, the Chancellor promised a written reply in view of the importance of the question.In reply to a question by Herr von Ribbentrop as to whether the return of all the former colonies, including those in the possession of British Dominions, was contemplated by the British Government, the British Ambassador said that be could only speak for Great Britain and that his remarks did not apply to the Dominions.
