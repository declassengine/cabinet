The Committee of Imperial Defence agreed : (1) To approve the order of priority for the duties of the Army within the sphere of Home Defence as Air Defence, Internal Security and Coast Defence in that order.(2) With reference to the Conclusions of the Defence Policy and Require-ments Sub-Committee at their 44th Meeting (Minute 2), to approve the proposal that the two regular anti-aircraft groups should be maintained at a peace time establishment which would enable the units at the shortest possible notice to function in the United Kingdom at full operational efficiency for a period of about 48 hours, by which time they would be made up to full strength with reserves; and to take note that any regular anti-aircraft troops at home would thus be immediately available at any time for the defence of London before the Territorial anti-aircraft groups were embodied.(3) To approve, in principle, the proposal for the defence of certain vital points against low-flying attack to be&quot; undertaken by employees of factories and public utility companies, enrolled in the Territorial Army Reserve, on the understanding that these defences (a) would be an integral part of the air defence of Great Britain,(b) would be confined to points for which defences would in any case be necessary, and could not be provided more economically by Territorial units on a full time basis.(4) To take note that the Secretary of State for War would submit in due course further details of the scheme referred to in (3) above(5) That the full requirements of the ground defences for the present approved scheme for the air defence of Great Britain could not be decided until the Home Defence Sub-Committee had reported as to the total numbers of guns and lights necessary to co-operate with the 38 Fighter Squadrons already approved by the Cabinet; and that the Sub-Committee should accordingly be instructed to complete their report with the least possible delay.(6) That the War Office should not be required for the present to include in their programme provision for any further A.A. guns and lights beyond those which the Committee of Imperial Defence should decide to be necessary as the counterpart of the 38 Squadrons referred to in (5) above.[16888-1]
(7) To take note that until the Field Force could be re-equipped with converted field guns and new types of medium howitzers, its artillery would he Completely out-ranged by the artillery of other first-class Powers.(8) In these circumstances to authorise the War Office to allocate any new capacity for gun production that might be discovered over and above that already allocated to requirements of anti-aircraft guns, to the fulfilment of requirements of the Field Force. (9) To take note of the intention of the War Office to train all troops at home, whether regular or Territorial, in the duties which they might have to carry out in assisting the civil power in the event of intensive air attacks on the United Kingdom.(10) To approve the proposal of the War Office to earmark  1,800,000 for the defences of the Category A ports at home during the next four years, this sum to be allocated to (a) the installation of defences at Invergordon and Scapa Flow, (b) the completion of the close defences (6-inch and A.M.T.B.), priority being given to the east coast ports.(11) To recommend that the principle should be re-established and rigidly observed in the future that, wherever their communications are liable to interruption, our overseas garrisons should be maintained in peace time at a strength adequate for defence on the outbreak of war; or alternatively that the necessary reserves should be held in the neigh-bourhood available to reinforce at short notice.(12) To take note that if it should prove necessary for financial reasons to limit the strength of the Navy below the new standard of naval strength recommended by the Defence Requirements Committee in C.I.D. Paper No. 1215-B, Enclosure 2, Volume 1, paragraph 34, the whole question of the strength and disposition of bur overseas garrisons would require reconsideration.(13) To take note of the desirability of maintaining a reserve of British troops under control of the War Office, as well as its sources of supply, in some locality east of the Mediterranean basin; but that the fulfilment of this conception must depend partly on the result of negotiations between the War Office and India Office, referred to in (16) below, and partly on other factors, both political and financial, which would require further examination in detail.(14) To approve the principle that wherever circumstances permit, regular units, composed of local personnel, should be substituted wholly or partially for British units in the garrisons overseas, and that regular British anti-aircraft and coast defence units abroad should be diluted with local personnel; and to take note that the arrangements necessary for this purpose would be discussed between the Secretary of State for War and the Secretary of State for the Colonies. (15) To take note that the Cabinet had already agreed that the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs should place himself in communication with the Secretary of State for War on the subject of the proposed further approach to some of the Dominions with a view to obtaining assistance in time of peace in the defence of Imperial Communications (e.g., in the garrison of Singapore). N (16) To take note-(a) that the Prime Minister had authorised discussion between the india Office and the Wai&apos; Office on the questions raised in paragraphs 14-15 of the Memorandum by the Secretary of State for War.   (Annex to Paper No. LtP. (P) 21.)(b) that it is proposed to refer questions of detail in this connectionfor examination by an Inter-departmental Committee, on which the General Staff in India would prohahly be represented.(17) To recommend that the Air Ministry should also be represented on the Inter-departmental-Committee referred to in (16 (b) ) above.(18) To approve the proposals of the War Office for the equipment for general purposes of formations of the Field Force as follows :--(a) two regular divisions and one mobile division, with full war reserves of ammunition ready to embark in 21 days;
2 Whitehall Gardens, S. W. 1. March 17, 1938.(b) two regular divisions with war reserves of ammunition at half thescale of (a),.ready to embark in 40 days;(c) provision of a pool of equipment and ammunition sufficient topermit despatch overseas 4 months after the outbreak of war of a further two divisions (regular or Territorial), with war reserves as in (b);-and to take note that the reserves of (a) above would be, in fact, on a continental scale, but for defensive warfare only. (19) To take note that as an emergency measure, by drawing on the pool referred to in (18 (c)) above, the maximum force which could be despatched overseas in the early stages of a war would be 4 regular divisions and 1 mobile division, but that in these circumstances no further contingents could be sent for at least 10 months and probably more.(20) That the information contained in (18) and (19) above should be communicated to the French Government in the conversations to be held in accordance with the conclusions of the Cabinet referred to in C.I.D. Paper No. 1405-B.(21) To take note that the War Office plans make no provision in peace-time for the expansion of the Army on a national scale in time of war.(22) That the above conclusions should be referred to the Cabinet for consideration at the Meeting to be held on Wednesday, the 23rd March, 1938.

They agreed : &quot; (a) That the memorandum by the Secretary Of State for War on the Organisation of the Army for its Role in War (CP. 26 (38)) should be referred, in the first instance, to the Committee of Imperial Defence.(b) To take note that the Prime Minister authorised the initiation of conversations between the India Office and the War Office on the questions raised in paragraphs 14 and 15 of CP. 26 (38).(c) That the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs should place himself in communication with the Secretary of State for War on the subject of the proposed further approach to some of the Dominions with a view to obtaining assistance in time of peace in the defence of Imperial communications (e,g., in the garrison of Singapore).* * * * *&quot;2. In accordance with Conclusion (a) of the Cabinet which is quoted above, I invited the Ministers most closely concerned, namely, the Secretaries of State for India, War and Air and the First Lord of the Admiralty, together with the three Chiefs of Staff, to form a Sub-Committee under my Chairmanship for the examination of the Secretary of State for War&apos;s Memorandum, a copy of which is attached as an Annex to this paper. This copy contains two amendments which have been made, with the concurrence of the Secretary of State for War, at the instance respectively of the Cabinet and of the Sub-Committee referr3d to in this paragraph.3. The Sub-Committee held a Meeting on the 28th February, 1938, and invited me to prepare a Memorandum for the Committee of Imperial Defence in the light of the discussion which then took place. I propose to relate my remarks to the relevant paragraphs in the Memorandum by the Secretary of State for War, and to refrain from any comment on matters which are of purely domestic concern to the War Office.[16822]b
Paragraph 2 :  Home Defence.4. In paragraph &apos;2 the Secretary of State for War places home defence first in order of priority among the duties which the Army must be prepared to under-take. This is in accordance with the recommendations made by me in my Interim Report to the Cabinet on Defence Expenditure in Future Years, which was approved in general by the Cabinet on the 22nd December, 1937.* The Secretary of State also proposes that in home defence the priorities should be : air defence, internal security and coast defence. We agree that these three duties are rightly placed in this order of priority.Paragraph 3 : Regular A ir Defence Units.5. The Committee of Imperial Defence will recall that the Defence Policy and Requirements Sub-Committee at their 44th Meeting agreed : &quot; To approve the proposal of the War Office for the maintenance of the two anti-aircraft groups of the Regular Army at a peace establishment approximately equal to their war establishment.&quot;It was subsequently agreed by the Committee of Imperial Defence at their 302nd Meeting that this approval should be &apos;&apos; on the assumption that this decision would not prejudice the general question of defence expenditure, which was shortly to be examined as a whole.&quot; We are informed that in accordance with these decisions the War Office now propose to maintain the two regular anti-aircraft groups at a peace establishment which would enable the units at the shortest possible notice to function in this country at full operational efficiency for a period of about 48 hours, by which time they would be made up to full strength with reservists. These two groups would thus be immediately available at any time for the defence of London before the Territorial anti-aircraft groups were embodied. After the embodiment of the Territorials the two regular groups would remain available as a mobile reserve until such time as they were required to accompany any field force despatched from this country overseas.Paragraph 4 : Defence against low-flying A attack.6. The Secretary of State for War in paragraph 4 refers to a scheme which has been evolved under which the defence of certain vital points against low-flying attack would be undertaken by the employees of factories and public utility companies. These employees would be enrolled in the Territorial Army Reserve and would continue in their ordinary civil employment except when actually required for working the defences. We are informed that these local defence Units would form an integral part of the air defence of Great Britain, and that they would be affiliated to the anti-aircraft groups operating in the areas in which they were located. The full details of the scheme have not yet been worked out, but the principle on which it is based has our full approval. The Secretary of State for War has undertaken to submit to the Committee of Imperial Defence in due course further information as to the details of the scheme.Paragraphs 5 and 6 : Territorial Air Defence Formations.7. The Committee of Imperial Defence have already expressed the view that the so-called &quot; ideal &quot; scheme for the air defence of Great Britain would be by no means an over-insurance; and the Cabinet has approved the fulfilment of the first two stages of this scheme, namely the northward extension of the Air-craft Fighting Zone and the provision of the defences for the Forth and Clyde. The Secretary of State for War, in explaining paragraphs 5 and 6 of his Memo-randum, pointed out that to proceed with the &quot; ideal&quot; scheme beyond these two first stages would involve an additional expenditure by the War Office of some  37,000,000, and would very seriously prejudice the fulfilment of the other require-ments of the Army in the matter of gun production. In these circumstances he proposes, unless the Cabinet decide otherwise, that for the present the commitments of the War Office should be limited to the completion of the existing approved* Vide Paper No. D.P.*(P.) 15.f C.T.D. Paper No. 255-A and OLD. 294th Meeting, Minute 8 (i).
scheme for the air defence of Great Britain, with the addition of the first two stages of the &quot;ideal&quot; scheme referred to above. We note that this proposal is made solely on grounds of economy and difficulties of production, and not on the grounds that the protection against air attack thus afforded will provide a really adequate degree of defence. Nevertheless, the fact remains that the approval of this proposal would involve a limitation in a sphere which the Cabinet has agreed should take the highest priority of all in our defence programmes.8. In this connection the Chief of the Air Staff, in the absence of the Secre-tary of State for Air, desired it to be placed on record that it would be beyond the capacity of the Royal Air Force with their own resources to protect certain aerodromes which lie outside the area covered by the air defences of Great Britain. It would therefore be necessary in due course for the Air Ministry to ask for anti-aircraft defence to be provided by the Army for the protection of these outlying aerodromes.9. The whole question of the scope of the air defences of Great Britain is at present in process of re-examination by the Home Defence Committee, and in anycase it must come within the purview of my forthcoming report to the Cabinet on the allocation among Service Departments of the total sum available for defence: programmes. In these circumstances we took note of this particular proposal of the Secretary of State for War, and submit it for an expression of opinion as-to the relative importance of the completion of the &quot; Ideal &quot; Air Defence Scheme and of the requirements of the Army with regard to field guns.Paragraph 7 : Internal Security.10. We welcome the intention of the War Office to train all troops at home, whether Regular or Territorial, in the duties which they might have to carry out in assisting the civil power in the event of intensive air attacks on this country. This proposal accords with the suggestion which I put forward in regard to the role of the Territorial Army in my Interim Report on Defence Expenditure in Future Years (Enclosure to Paper No. D.P. (P) 15, paragraph 79 (ii) ). The whole-question is now under preliminary examination by the Home Defence Committee.Paragraph 8 : Coast Defence.11. We concur in the opinion expressed in paragraph 8 that a high order of precedence involving disproportionate expenditure on coast defences at home is not desirable. At the same time we desire to emphasise that if it should ever become necessary to send the Fleet to the Far East, we should not have the same naval superiority in home waters as we enjoyed during the last war, and that, in these circumstances, the defences of the home ports would assume considerable importance.12. The revised estimated cost, so far as the War Office is concerned, of the recommendations of the Joint Oversea and Home Defence Committee for the modernisation of the home ports, which recently received the approval of the Committee of Imperial Defence (C.I.D. Paper&apos; No. 266-A and C.I.D. 301st Meeting, Minute 10), amounts to some  4,500,000, and out of this total the War Office propose to spend about  1,800,000 during the next four years. . We understand that this expenditure will permit the installation of defences at Invergordon and Scapa Flow, which are at present entirely undefended, as well as the completion of the close defences (i.e., 6-inch and A/M.T.B.) at all the Category &quot; A&quot; ports in Great Britain, priority in execution being given to the East Coast ports. Having regard to the heavy demands of other spheres of defence, we consider that the claims of coast defence at home would be fairly met by an expenditure of this order.Paragraph 9 : British Commitments Abroad.13. The Secretary of State for War in paragraph 9, refers to British commitments overseas, including defended ports on the trade routes, and enunciates the principle that wherever sea communications are liable to interruption by sea, land or air, garrisons should be maintained in peace-time at a strength adequate for defence at the outbreak of war; or, alternatively, that the necessary reserves should be held in the neighbourhood available to reinforce at[16822] b 2
short notice. This statement of principle is almost precisely in the terms of a recommendation by the Carnarvon Commission on the Defence of Colonial Possessions. In paragraph 157 of the Third and final Report of this Commission, which is dated the 22nd July, 1882, the following passage appears : &quot; The stations far distant from the United Kingdom and in close proximity to the stations of foreign Powers are liable to sudden attack, and cannot be reinforced without long delay; their garrisons, therefore, must be kept up to war strength.&quot;Right up to the outbreak of war in 1914 this principle was rigidly observed, except in certain special cases where it was possible to safeguard our ports by means of treaties. For example, before the War it was owing to the existence of the Anglo-Japanese Alliance that a lower standard of defence was accepted for Hong Kong than was actually considered necessary to withstand Japanese attack. Since the War this principle has been largely ignored, but in present circum-stances, it is more than ever important that it should be once more observed. The preponderance of naval strength which we have enjoyed in the past may not be ours in the future; and our bases overseas might have to withstand attack for a long period without it being possible to relieve them. We accordingly recommend most strongly that the principle of self-sufficiency for overseas garrisons, enunciated by the Secretary of State for War in this paragraph, should be once more re-established and rigidly observed in the future.Paragraphs 10 and 11.14. In paragraph 11 and again in paragraph 15 the Secretary of State for War draws attention to the desirability, if resources were available and conditions permitted, of holding a larger reserve of British troops overseas. His idea is that these troops should all be stationed in India or in Palestine or in Egypt; or alternatively, distributed between those countries. The fulfilment of this conception must depend mainly on the outcome of the discussions which are to be held between the Secretary of State for War and the Secretary of State for India, regarding the British garrison in India, to which reference is made in paragraphs 14 and 15 of the Memorandum, but we recommend the approval of the principle of maintaining under the control of the War Office a reserve of British troops east of the Mediterranean basin.Paragraph 12 : The Use of &quot; Imperial Personnel.&quot;15. We also recommend approval of the principle that, where circumstances permit, regular units composed of local personnel should be substituted wholly, or partially, for British units in garrisons overseas, and that regular British anti-aircraft and coast defence units abroad should be diluted with local personnel. We note that, as a first step in this direction, the War Office have it in mind to raise a battalion of local personnel on a regular basis in Malta. We consider that this would be a desirable measure. The Secretary of State for War informs us that he intends to discuss with the Secretary of State for the Colonies these proposals for the use of Colonial personnel in units of the Army.Paragraph 13.16. We note that the Cabinet has already agreed that the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs should place himself in communication with the Secretary of State for War on the subject of the proposed further approach to some of the Dominions with a view to obtaining assistance in time of peace in the defence of Imperial communications (e.g., in the garrison of Singapore). We should welcome any progress that could be made in this direction.Paragraphs 14, 15 and 16 : India.17. The Secretary of State for War in paragraphs 14 and 15 raises important questions of principle in connection with the British garrison in India. We note that the Prime Minister has authorised discussion between the India Office and the War Office on these questions, and we are informed by the Secretary of State for War that he has expressed his willingness himself to initiate these conversations. We are also informed that it is proposed to refer questions of detail for examination by an inter-departmental Committee, on which the General
Staff in India will probably be i&apos;epresented. We consider that the Air Ministry should also be represented, since they must be concerned in many of the questions to be discussed. Pending the outcome of the negotiations between the War Office and the India Office, we are unable to make any comments on the subject-matter of these paragraphs.Paragraph 17 : Present Resources.18. It is stated in paragraph 17 that the War Office propose, so long as the present organisation prevails, to make arrangements so as to be able to despatch overseas in three weeks two regular divisions and the mobile division equipped for general purposes, to be followed by two other regular divisions 40 days after the outbreak of war. The Secretary of State for War informs us that the war reserves of ammunition in these divisions would, as it ha/ppens, be to all intents on a Continental scale, though their equipment and the composition of their supporting troops, being designed &quot;for general purposes,&quot; would be slightly different from that which the War Office would employ if these formations were primarily intended for warfare on the Continent of Europe. We are informed, however, that the second two divisions would have war reserves at only half the -continental scale.19. It is explained to us that, if the necessity arose, the arrangements now contemplated by the War Office would permit the disembarkation on the Continent of a force of two regular divisions and one mobile division, ready for war on the Continental scale with full war reserves, twenty-two days after the outbreak of war. Moreover, as an emergency measure, the second two regular divisions could be made available for despatch after forty days with the same scale of equipment, and with full war reserves, by drawing on the pool of war reserves which, as stated in the second sub-paragraph of paragraph 17 of the Memorandum, it is proposed to maintain in order that a fifth division and a sixth division could be put into the field four months after the outbreak of war. If this emergency measure were taken, however, the despatch of the fifth and sixth divisions would have to be postponed for a considerable period, until war production had begun to build up further reserves of equipment and stores. To sum up, therefore, if the present proposals of the War Office are approved in full, the maximum force which we could send to the Continent in the early stages of a war would be four regular divisions and one mobile division. That would be the limit of our resources, and no further contingents could be sent for possibly as much as ten months.Paragraph 21.20. In paragraph 21 the Secretary of State for War expresses the view-that &apos;&apos; It would be inadvisable for us to divert from our own productive effort to the Army more personnel than is required to hold our defensive positions.&quot; He explained to the Sub-Committee that, in using the phrase &quot; to hold our defensive positions,&quot; he had in mind the Cabinet&apos;s decision that the role of the Army was, first, the defence of the home country, and, second, the defence of our oversea bases. He wished to make it clear that the War Office had no intention of making preparations in peace time for forming in time of war a lai&apos;ge army on a national scale for operations overseas. Should it ever become necessary greatly to expand the Army, as was done in the last war, we should have to depend for its equip-ment upon the output of the war potential which is now being built up.21. It will perhaps be convenient to summarise our conclusions on the individual proposals as follows : (1) We recommend the approval of the order of priority for the duties of the Army within the sphere of Home Defence, namely Air Defence, Internal Security and Coast Defence, in that order.(2) We note with satisfaction the arrangements being made to ensure the immediate readiness for action of the two regular anti-aircraft groups.(3) We support the proposal that the defence of certain vital points against low-flying attack should be undertaken by the employees of factories and public utility companies.
(4) The proposal of the War Office for setting a limit at the present time to their commitments in respect of the air defence of Great Britain is not ripe for consideration until the Home Defence Committee have completed their examination of the whole question of the further extension of this defence. In any case, this question will fall to be dealt with by me in my report to the Cabinet on the allocation among Service Departments of the total sum available for defence pro-grammes. We invite, however, an expression of opinion as to the relative importance of the &quot; Ideal &quot; Air Defence Scheme and the requirements of the Army.(5) We agree that a high order of precedence involving disproportionate expenditure on coast defence at home is not desirable, and we con-sider that the programme proposed for the installation of defences at Scapa Flow and Invergordon and for the modernisation of the close defences of the Category &apos; A &quot; ports is, in all the circumstances, adequate. 1 i(6) We recommend most strongly that the principle should be re-established and rigidly observed in the future, that, wherever their communica-tions are liable to interruption, our overseas garrisons should be maintained in peace time at a strength adequate for defence at the&quot; outbreak of war; or, alternatively, that the necessary reserves should be held in the neighbourhood, available to reinforce at short notice.(7) We favour the idea, should this be found practicable, of maintaining under the control of the War Office a larger reserve of British troops east of the Mediterranean basin.(8) We recommend the approval of the principle that where circumstances permit British garrisons and units overseas should be diluted with Colonial personnel.(9) We should welcome any arrangements that could be made to obtain the assistance of the Dominions in peace in the defence of Imperial communications, and to reduce the numbers of British troops which have to be retained under the control of the Government of India for internal security purposes in that country.22.   In conclusion, there are two observations of a general nature to be made.23. In my Interim Report to the Cabinet on Defence Expenditure in Future Years, I suggested that &quot; Our first and main effort should be directed to two principal objectives  namely, to protecting this country against attack and to preserving the trade routes,Our third objective should be the maintenance of forces for the defence of British territories overseas against attack by sea, land or air,Our fourth objective, which can only be provided after the other objectives have been met, should be co-operation in the defence of the territories of any allies we may have in war.&quot;The Cabinet approved this statement of priorities-, in our defence commit-ments. I do not think that it can be denied, however, that the proposals of the Secretary of State for War tend in general to diminish, so far as the Army is concerned, the importance of the first objective stated above, namely, the protec-tion of this country against attack; and to advance the priority of the fourth objective, namely, the co-operation in the defence of the territories of any allies we may have in war.24. The second point I wish to bring to the notice of the Committee of Imperial Defence is the close relation between the standard of our naval strength and the organisation, peace disposition, and use in war of the Army. If British commitments abroad are. to be given a second priority to home defence, the policy can only be justified on the assumption that our sea communications can be adequately defended by the Navy in future. In the last war we had a dominant Navy, while our foes were, in the main, confined to the European area. We can be certain of neither of these advantages in the future.   If it should ever prove
necessary, for financial reasons, to limit the strength of the Navy below the new standard of naval strength recommended by the Defence Requirements Committee, * our scattered garrisons overseas, which are detailed in Appendix I of the Memorandum by the Secretary of State for War. might be entirely insufficient. Indeed, the abandonment of territories of lesser importance, and the concentration of our military and air forces in the more vital positions, might be the only solution.(Initialled) T. W. H.

[ANNEX]MOST SECRET. - Corv No. 20 4CP. 26 (38).   CABINET paper the ORGANIZATION OF THE ARMY FOR ITS ROLE IN war memorandum BY THE  SECRETARY OF STATE  FOR WARi. For the information of my colleagues I have drawn up the following statement of the dispositions and contemplated organization of the land forces, in order that they may see what resources are available and to what use it is intended to adapt them in the light of the new role allotted to the Army.*Home defence. In preparing the Army for war the menace of air attack is a primary consideration. On the outbreak of war defence against air attack may be the primary requirement: in this major respect Home Defence is in the first category of importance, and in a form unknown in 1914.The priorities in Home Defence are Air Defence; Internal Security, which assumes a widened scope in the light of air raid precautions; and Coast Defence.Regular Air Defence Units3. There are two Regular Anti-Aircraft Groups! provided for the protection of the Regular Army and available as a mobile reserve to A.D.G.B. to the extent to which, and for the time during which, any part of these groups may be at home. These Regular Groups are now composed of R.A. and R.E.. personnel, as are also A.A. units abroad. Coast Defences abroad are, in general, similarly manned. The proportion of R.A. and RE. personnel so employed will amount on approved establishments to over 25 per cent, and over 33 per cent, of these two Corps respectively. As the great majority of the personnel are found by the Royal Artillery and the duties are more appropriate to this Regiment it is proposed to form a separate branch of the Royal Artillery to man both the guns and the lights of Regular Air and Coast Defence units at home and abroad. This reorganization will involve, later, some similar adjust-ment in the Territorial Army.Defetice against Low Flying Attack4. A scheme is being evolved under which defence against low-flying attack will be undertaken by the employees of factories and public utility companies.., Territorial Air Defence Formations5. Two Territorial divisions are at present employed in the Air Defence of Great Britain. Their total establishments are 608 guns, 2,547 lights, 48,000 personnel. They cover an area from Newcastle to Portsmouth, with defences at the outlying ports. Under the full Ideal Scheme the additional requirements would be 656 guns, 2,137 lights, 45,000 personnel.To fulfil this scheme about two more Territorial Air Defence divisions would be needed: these would be formed partly by conversion of existing Territorial units and partly by raising new units. The latter course would be necessaiy in some cases since the possibility of conversion depends on whether the requisite number of units are both concentrated and suitably situated.* CP. 316 (37) and Cabinet 49, Item i, Conclusion (c) (ii).f Of these approximately half one group is at present in or en route for Egypt.
6. Of the Ideal Scheme the Cabinet have approved the next two stages, namely the Tyne defences and the Forth and Clyde defences. These entail the provision of 32 guns, 480 lights, 7,500 personnel (equivalent to about one third of a division) over and above the two divisions already in being. There will thus remain, on a nonnal basis, about ill- T.A. divisions, or, if the Ideal Scheme is approved in full, about 10 T.A. divisions available for other purposes.To proceed, unless the Cabinet in their review of priorities so desire, with further stages of the Ideal Scheme at the present time would be at the undue expense of other items of the rearmament programme, for which but a limited industrial capacity is available. Indeed the present approved programme of A.D.G.B. is already delaying rearmament in other directions.Internal Security7. Under the chaotic conditions which may be produced by air attacks a entrance a large and widely distributed force of disciplined troops will be needed. They will be required to co-operate with the civil authorities in many tasks, such as keeping open communications, both road and rail, assisting with wireless, defending vulnerable points against sabotage, and helping in the smooth working of Air Raid Precautions. All troops at home, whether Regular or Territorial, may have to play their part in these duties, and the General Staff propose to give attention to the question of training in them, without, however, giving the impression that an actual state of emergency exists at present.Coast Defence8. The Coast Defence of Great Britain, mainly undertaken to meet naval requirements, is entrusted to units of the Territorial Army, numbering 35 batteries which, with lights, have an establishment of 7,330 officers and men. The command of the sea, which in itself makes any considerable attack from seaward improbable, is reinforced by the deterrent effect of our aircraft. A high order of precedence involving disproportionate expenditure on Coast Defences at Home does not therefore seem desirable.British Commitments Abroad9. Second in priority to Home Defence comes the discharge of British commitments overseas, which include defended ports on the Trade Routes. Our obligations, exclusive of India and Burma, are set out in Appendix 1 which tabulates (a) the existing garrisons and (b) the size and type of garrisons which, if they were available, would provide the minimum insurance for internal security and defence against external attack.This minimum is based on the principle that wherever sea communications are liable to interruption, by sea, land or air, the garrison should be maintained in peace time at a strength adequate for defence at the outbreak of war. Alter-natively, the necessary reserves should be held in the neighbourhood, available to reinforce at short notice.10. The existing garrisons of Gibraltar and Malta include four &quot; short tour &quot; battalions; moreover there are three such battalions in Palestine and two in Egypt. Some of these &quot; short tour &quot; battalions are only some 300 strong, owing to the recruiting situation. They are composed of officers and men who, under the Cardwell system, would normally be serving at home but who find them-selves detailed for an extra tour of service overseas.Our Imperial commitments in peace can only be discharged by makeshifts and devices (e.g., short tour battalions, calling up Section A Reservists, etc.) which place a great strain on the resources of the Army and on the forbearance of the soldier.In Appendix 2 is a statement showing the strength and distribution of British troops at home and abroad.11. To sum up: it will be seen that a total of 28 British battalions are now stationed overseas, excluding India and Burma, the infantry equivalent of some o\ divisions (measured by present standards), together with the mobile division it is proposed to organise from the troops now in Egypt. If resources were available and conditions permitted, it would be desirable to hold overseas in addition one mobile division, one division, and five battalions.
The use of &quot; Imperial Personnel &quot;12. Throughout the Empire there are at present a number of regular units composed of local personnel such as the King&apos;s African Rifles, the Royal West African Frontier Force, the Sudan Defence Force, the Hong Kong and Singapore Royal Artillery, the Malay Regiment, etc. The majority of the units are not under the control of the War Office. The total personnel amounts to about 17,000 officers and men. This figure does not include the considerable volunteer organizations that also exist on a territorial basis, such as the Ceylon Defence Force, the Kenya Defence Force, the Singapore Volunteer Corps and many others. Organizations of these kinds, whether on a regular or volunteer basis, are invaluable in reducing the number of regular British units to be maintained. Moreover, the psychological effect on the personnel of undertaking military responsibilities if of high value in counteracting subversive teachings.I therefore contemplate extending the system, beginning with the raising of a battalion in Malta of local personnel on a regular basis, if the Colony will make a financial contribution. This battalion, when raised, would make up the existing deficiency of a battalion in the Colony. I also propose to dilute regular British anti-aircraft and Coast Defence units with local personnel to the full extent that circumstances make this course reasonable.13. In this connection I would call attention to the desirability of some degree of regional responsibility, or at least assistance by the Dominions, in peace, in the defence of Imperial communications; Singapore is an obvious case in point. Although I am aware that the suggestion is not a new one I am of the opinion that it should be again raised specifically with the Governments concerned.India14. By far the largest part of the Regular Army stationed overseas in peace is absorbed by the garrisons of India and Burma. Since the reorganization which followed the mutiny, the establishment of British troops has been reduced by only 20,000 men to 57,000. The establishment of the native Indian Army has risen by 7,000 to 139,000, backed by reserves of 37,000 men. In the period there have been great changes in India the effects of which seem to suggest the desirability of re-examining the present requirements. Among such changes are the increased mobility of armies, the advent of the Air Ann, and the diminution of danger to Indian frontiers from external aggression.The government of India have accepted, subject to the situation within and beyond the land frontiers of India permitting, certain commitments to despatch forces overseas to discharge Imperial tasks not directly connected with the defence of India.These include the following:  (a) Reinforcement for Egypt (including Aden) 1 Infantry Brigade Group.lb) Reinforcement for Singapore 1 Infantry Brigade Group.(c) Garrison for Anglo-Iranian Oilfields 1 Infantry Brigade Group.In addition, the Government of India have potential commitments in relation to the reinforcement of Hong Kong and Burma, and normally one Indian battalion is stationed at Hong Kong and one at Malaya.15. Because of the special difficulties of the Mediterranean passage it is desirable to locate part of the Imperial strategic reserve, as well as its sources of supply, east of the Mediterranean basin. The present limitations on the availability of British forces in India to meet an emergency elsewhere to the best advantage are an inconvenient and perhaps dangerous restraint. Besides the questions of the actual proportion of British troops in India, and their avaiJability as reserves, there are other questions which call for solution. Among those are the reorganization of the Army in India on modern lines, the speed at which it can be effected, and the reduction of establishments as part of that reorganization. Until decisions have been reached there can be no satisfactory re-distribution of the British Army as a whole in accordance with present strategic needs, nor can there be, in accordance with the same needs, a suitable-reorganization of the rest of the Army.
To these questions might be added another the amenities of British troops, who are dependent for their comfort on the willingness and ability of India to meet their share of the cost.16. I hope that the Prime Minister, with the concurrence of my colleagues, would agree to initiate conversations between the India Office and the War Office with a view to reaching an agreement.Present Resources17. Under the former role of the Army four divisions and a Mobile division were being organized to be able to go to the Continent in 15 days. The War Office had requested, but not received, authority to proceed with the logical implications of this role, which involved the subsequent despatch of 12 more divisions, in echelons of four divisions at a time. It is now proposed, so long as the present organization prevails, to be able to despatch overseas within 3 weeks 2 Regular divisions and the Mobile division, equipped for general purposes. They could be followed by the other two Regular divisions in z 4- 40 days.It is also proposed to hold a pool of equipment, including the necessary war reserves, sufficient to put a further two divisions, Regular or Territorial, into the field in four months after the outbreak of war. By that time industrial out-put will have begun to make up its lee-way and the remaining divisions, up to ten in number could, we hope, be in possession of modern equipment ten months after mobilization. As their state of training and the supply of stores and war reserves develop, these additional divisions could be available for defensive or counter-offensive operations. It will be recalled that authority has already been given* for the Territorial Army to receive equipment of the same type as that of the Regular Army to enable it to be trained in peace.Reorganization18. It is now necessary to proceed to a reorganization of the divisions which were being prepared for the Continental role, and on new principles. Smaller divisions are easier to manage, to move, to supply and to ship.Quality combined with mobility can diminish the need for mere numbers of men. The foundations of tactical effectiveness will therefore be revised in the light of modern conditions. A figure of 200,000 Regular soldiers is not, in itself, large in relation to our world-wide exposure, but by applying the principle that strength is measured not so much by man power as by fire power with mobility, it should be possible to use the men available with an increasing ratio of effect.19. Reorganization will accordingly take place not only of the divisional establishment as a whole but also of units within the division. By reducing the size of the divisions a larger number of more compact formations can be organized, suitable for quick despatch and for effective action in any part of -the world. The same number of guns, grouped in larger units for the better development of their fire power, will give a proportionately increased support to smaller infantry units. The smaller divisions being more highly mechanized and more economically manned will not only enhance our tactical advantages in war but will enable the money devoted to the Army to be spent more usefully and with more effective results.These principles apply equally to the organization of Territorial divisions, whose establishments are now being re-examined.20. We must also adopt all possible expedients for making the best use of our fully trained man power, by relieving it in war of duties equally well performed by others, and by reinforcing it from all available sources. As illustrations of what can be accomplished in these directions may be quoted the inclusion in war of certain Territorial- units within Regular formations (thus economising in the provision of Regular units), the defence of vulnerable points by National Defence Companies, the provision of officers from the Emergency Reserve and the Cadet Reserve, the provision of motor drivers**(Cabinet 20 (37), Conclusion 4)
from the Company of Veteran Motorists and such bodies. There is no reason why women should not be engaged forthwith as part of the Army Reserve, so that on the outbreak of hostilities they can release individuals, and even the bulk of certain units, for inclusion in active formations. Such arrange-ments have never formed part of our War Establishments as conceived in peace.21. In making such proposals as these I have borne in mind that, being an industrial country, it would be inadvisable for us to divert from our own productive effort to the Army more personnel than is required to hold our defensive positions. But for an industrial country there is great advantage in so organizing the Army that employment in it maintains as close a relation-ship as possible with a man&apos;s normal avocations and interests.Therefore the money which is devoted to the Army can in the national interest, as well as with the best tactical effect, be spent on a high degree of mechanization with a minimum of skilled and, if possible, well paid personnel to direct and operate it.Continental Commitments22. It will be seen from paragraph 17 above what troops may be at our disposal, if the need arises, to go to the assistance of an ally in the defence of her territory. It should be emphasized that, apart from the first two divisions and the Mobile Division, their equipment and war reserves will not be on the Continental scale. They should be despatched only if the situation in the rest of the world permits, and it would be necessary for the General Staff to review the whole field of possible action open to the enemy before this could be determined. I suggest that it is of great importance that our potential allies should be left in no doubt as to the possibilities of direct assistance on our part and that the various alternative operations, whether in defence or in local offence, which our available reserves may have to undertake should be covered by any discussions or interchange of information which take place.Conclusion23. I feel it necessary to put the Cabinet in possession of the general trend of my proposals for the Army. I trust that they will commend themselves to my colleagues, who will, I hope, agree that on these lines we shall make the best use of the small Regular Army of 200,000 men, which I have assumed as the maximum number likely to be available in peace.Summary24. The following is a summary of my main proposals:  Home Defence(a) Air Defence (i) The formation of a separate branch of the Royal Artillery to man bothguns and lights of Regular anti-aircraft units, and of Coast Defences abroad (paragraph 3).(ii) Defence against low-flying attack to be met by organizing employees of factories, etc. (paragraph 4).(iii) Two Territorial divisions are at present employed in A.D.G.B.  A furthertwo divisions would be needed to implement the full Ideal Scheme (paragraph 5). It is not recommended, unless the Cabinet in their review of priorities so desire, that the Ideal Scheme should be carried, at present, further than the stages already authqrized (paragraph 6).(6) Internal Security. Since both Regulars and Territorials may have to assist in Internal Security duties in war, a measure of training is required (paragraph 7).(c) Coast Defence. Disproportionate expenditure on Coast Defence at Home is not desirable (paragraph 8).
Commitments Overseas(d) Our garrisons include 9 battalions who, under the Cardwell system, should be serving at home. To maintain 28 battalions in garrisons overseas, exclusive of India and Burma, is not easy. If resources were available about 2 Mobile divisions and the infantry equivalent of 3 divisions would be held on the spot or in close reserve (paragraph 11).(e) It is proposed to extend the system of locally raised units and to dilute certain Regular units with local personnel (paragraph 12).(/) The question of regional responsibility, or at least assistance by the Dominions, in peace in the defence of Imperial Communications should again be raised (paragraph 13).(g) India has accepted, conditionally, a number of commitments for the despatch of reinforcements (paragraph 14), but there are a number of questions which call for solution and it is recommended that conversations should be initiated between the India Office and the War Office with a view to reaching agreement (paragraphs 15 and 16).Present Resources(h) The war plan, so long as the present organization prevails, will allow for the despatch of 2 Regular divisions and a Mobile division, equipped for an Eastern theatre, in z 4- 3 weeks; and 2 more divisions in z -\- 40 days. A further 2 divisions will be equipped in z 4- 4 months and the remainder (up to ten in number), in z 4- 10 months (paragraph 17).Reorganizationii) It is intended to reorganize establishments so as to reduce the size of existing divisions and provide a larger number of more compact formations, in which fire power and mobility will be primary considerations (paragraphs 18 and 19). All possible steps will be taken to dilute trained Regular personnel, in war, by voluntary organizations (paragraph 20). The fact that we are an industrial country affects our organizations (paragraph 21).Continental Commitments(j) Our potential allies should be left in no doubt as to the possibilities of direct assistance on the part of the Army and in any discussions or interchange of information which may take place the whole strategical field should be covered (paragraph 22).L.
