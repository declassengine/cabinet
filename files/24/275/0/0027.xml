THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT. SECRET.CP.63(57). COPY NO.   ^/v cabinet. REGISTRATION OF STILL BIRTHS fSCOTLAND) BILL. Memonarvaum. by the Secretary cf State for J3 cgtl^axid.1.      This Bill, which has been introduced by Major Neven-Spence, provides for tlie. registration of still births in Scotland.     Still births have been registered in England since 1927 and are registered in nearly all other civilised countries.2,    The Committee on Scottish Health Services recommended the registration of still births on the ground that it was likely to add to the knowledge of the causes of the wastage of infant life and of puerperal morbidity and mortality.      In 1937 the infant mortality rate for Scotland was 32 while the rate for England was only 59.5.      The Bill differs from the law in force in England in that it calls for the recording of the cause of death where this is known. Under the Maternity Services  (Scotland) Act,  1937,  it is hoped to ensure that every expectant mother will have the benefit of a skilled midwifery service;    and it is expected that a doctor will be present in practically every case of still birth.      The information secured through the recording of the cause of death should be of considerable medical value.4.      The Bill has been given an unopposed Second Reading, but on its introduction Mr, Buchanan indicated that he and his colleagues might oppose it at a later stage.      I do not think that this can be pressed to great lengths and I should hope that after the Bill has passed through Committee,  the remaining stages would be unopposed. On this assumption I should be glad to have the authority of my colleagues to indicate that the Bill has the Government&apos; s sympatlry and to co-operate in its consideration through its further stages.W.E.E.Roovoish Office. . 10th March,  1938.
