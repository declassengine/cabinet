(THIS   DOCUMENT    IS    THE   PROPERTY    OF HIS    BRITANNIC   MAJESTY1S    GOVERNMENT).SECRET. J ,COPY   NO:      ft-&apos;CP.55(38).CABINET.FOOD AND DRUGS LAW CONSOLIDATION. Memorandum &quot;by the Minister of Health.1.     I desire to obtain Cabinet approval to the introduction into the House of Lords of a Bill to consolidate, with amendments, a further section of the law relating to public health in England and Wales.     The Bill, which is already drafted, is included in the list of Bills agreed to by the Cabinet on 6th October, 1937,  (Cabinet 36(37) Conclusion 11).2.     The Bill, following on the Public Health Act, 1936,  is the second instalment of public health consolidation and deals with the law relating to food and drugs, markets, slaughterhouses and cold air stores.It is based on the Third Interim Report of a Departmental Committee appointed in 1929 to consider and report on the form which a consolidation of the law of local government and public health should take, and the amendments which would be desirable to secure simplicity, uniformity and conciseness. The present Chairman is Lord Addington.     Copies of the Report (Cmd. 5628 of 1937) and of a draft Food and Drugs Bill (Cmd. 5629 of 1937)  published with it are annexed.3.      Since the publication of the Report I have submitted . the draft Bill to the various Associations of Local Authorities and to the Government Departments and other bodies concerned. The comments of these bodies have been referred to the Departmental Committee and upon receiving their recommendations I anticipate making a number of drafting and other minor
Ifunendments in the Bill to meet the views expressed.     Among these will he the application of certain clauses of the Bill to Scotland in accordance with the wishes of the Secretary of State for Scotland.4.     The Bill is not pure consolidation and cannot therefore he referred to the Joint Select Committee on Consolidating Bills. I propose that the procedure adopted in the case of the Local Government and Public Health Acts should he followed and that after second reading in the Lords, the two Houses should he invited to appoint a Joint Select Committee to consider the Bill.     I am assured that the passage of the Bill will he welcomed by the Associations of Local Authorities and others concerned in food and drugs administration, and I see no reason to suppose that the Bill will make any substantial demands on the time of Parliament.5.      I have discussed the proposals with the Treasury.k&quot;. w.Ministry of Health, 4th March, 1938.

LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND PUBLIC HEALTH CONSOLIDATION COMMITTEETHIRD INTERIM REPORTTo the Rt. Hon. Sir Kingsley Wood, P.C., M.P., Minister of Health.Sir,We have the the honour to submit herewith a Third Interim Report dealing with a further part of the Law relating to public health.INTRODUCTION.I. The largest part of - our task was completed with the issue in January, 1936, of our Second Interim Report (Cmd. 5059) and the draft Public Health Bill which accompanied it. The subsequent history of the Bill may be briefly recorded. A number of alterations were made in the Bill as a result of consultation and negotiation with the various bodies concerned, and the Bill was then introduced into the House of Lords on behalf of the Government on the 24th March, 1936. After the Motion for Second Reading had been carried without division the procedure adopted in the case of the Bill for the Local Government Act, 1933, was followed and the Bill was referred to a Joint Select Committee of both Houses. That Committee sat for six days examining the Bill in detail and taking evidence from the Parliamentary draftsman and the members of our Committee representing the Ministry of Health and the Home Office. They also had before them Sir Harry Pritchard, who gave evidence on behalf of the Association of Municipal Corpora-tions, and representatives of the Federation of British Industries and the Property Owners&apos; Association. A number of amend-ments were made in the Bill as a result of the Joint Committee&apos;s examination and the Bill, as amended, was reported and read a third time in the House of Lords on the 7th July, 1936. It was introduced into the House of Commons on the same day and was passed with one or two drafting amendments. The Royal Assent was given on the 31st July, 1936. The Act came into force on the 1st October, 1937.2. Shortly after the passing of the Bill, Major J. Milner, M.P., and Mr. H. J. Comyns, both of whom had served on the Committee continuously since its inception in 1930, retired, and Mr. S. S. Silverman, M.P. and Mr. J. N. Beckett were appointed to take their places. Major Milner had, in addition, served on both of the Joint Select Committees which considered the Local46610 A 4
Government and Public Health Bills and, as a member of those Committees and subsequently in the House of Commons, had materially assisted the progress of the Bills. Mr. Comyns&apos;s intimate knowledge of local government and public health had been of immense service to the Committee and we deeply regret the ill-health which caused his resignation.Subject matter and scope of the proposed Bill.3. In paragraph 3 of our Second Interim Report we set out a list of the various headings under which the public health law may roughly be classified. The Act of 1936 covers the first of these, and our original intention was to proceed to deal with the second, namely, provisions with regard to streets and building-lines. Further consideration, however, led us to the conclusion that the law of streets^ is so closely connected with the highway law in general that it would be unprofitable to deal with the two matters separately. The law of highways is not only beyond the terms of reference of the Committee but falls for the most part outside the scope of your Department, and the preparation of a Bill dealing with streets and highways would presumably be a matter for joint action (which, we understand, is in fact being taken) between the Ministries of Health and Transport. We accordingly decided to turn our attention to the third item on the list, namely, enactments dealing with food. The outcome is the present Report and a draft Food Bill, to the preparation of which the Committee has devoted 23 meetings.4. A preliminary examination of the law relating to food disclosed the fact that the existing enactments are in the main directed towards two distinct objects, namely, the safeguarding of public health, and the protection of purchasers from fraud and deception. The latter seems to have been originally the main object of the earlier legislation relating to food and drugs, which is now replaced by the consolidating Act of 1928. But the Act of 1928 includes provisions (notably in Sections 1 and 7) which are of a public health character, and in the administration of the other sections attention has been increasingly directed to those forms of adulteration and contamination which are likely to injure health. Again, the Milk Acts of 1915 and 1922 (which are mainly of a public health character) contain a number of sections aimed at fraud, though the frauds aimed at are mostly such as might be detrimental to nutrition.It thus became clear that, if the Bill was to be limited to a strictly Public Health Code, both the Act of 1928 and the Milk Acts would have to be cut into two. Apart from the practical difficulties of, and other objections to, this procedure, it appeared to us that the administrative advantages in having a single code dealing with both these aspects of the matter were such as to make any other course out of the question.
We also considered whether the proposed Bill might con-veniently include the provisions in the Sale of Food (Weights and Measures) Act, 1926, designed to prevent short weight and measure in the sale of food, and we consulted the Board of Trade who expressed the view (with which we concur) that it would be a mistake to include this branch of the law in the Bill.A further preliminary point arose in connection with London. As the Act of 1928 and the Milk Acts apply to London and the provisions as to unsound food contained in the London Act are practically identical with those contained in the Public Health Acts applicable to the rest of the country, we felt that the balance of advantage lay strongly in favour of including London in the proposed Bill.5. In view of the fact that our Terms of Reference were limited to the law of public health and to England and Wales exclusive of London, we found ourselves debarred from pro-ceeding on the lines which we were anxious to adopt. Our Chairman accordingly, at the request of the Committee, invited you to extend the Committee&apos;s Terms of Reference so as not only to cover provisions relating to food not of a public health character, but also to enable the Committee to deal with the law in London. An extension of the Terms of Reference was made in the following terms:  &quot; For the purpose of the consideration of the existing legislation relating to food and the preparation of a Bill dealing with that subject matter, I hereby extend the Terms of Reference of the Departmental  Committee on the Consolidation of the Law relating to Local Government and Public Health so as to include the enactments relating to the adulteration of food and drugs and I direct that for the purposes aforesaid the exclusion of London from the Terms of Reference is not to apply &quot;. Mr. L. C. Bowker, City Remembrancer, Mr. G. J. Cole, an officer of the London County Council, and Mr. F. Webster, Town Clerk of Kensington, were subsequently appointed addi-tional members of the Committee for the purpose of securing the representation of London thereon.   The Bill accordingly covers London with the exception of Part V, which relates to markets, slaughter-houses and cold-air stores.   The reasons for this exception are set out in the Note on Clause 102.6. A number of minor problems with regard to the scope of the Bill also called for consideration. It was clear that the Bill should include the Act of 1928, the food sections of the Act of 1875, and of the amending Acts of 1890, 1907, and 1925 (with the corresponding London provisions) and also the Milk Acts of 1915 and 1922, and the Artificial Cream Act, 1929. It seemed convenient also to insert in the Bill the provisions with regard to markets and slaughter-houses contained in the Act of
1875/ and sections of the Markets and Fairs Clauses Act, 1847, and the Towns Improvement Clauses Act, 1847, as incorporated in the said provisions of the Act of 1875. The insertion of provisions relating to slaughter-houses led to the question whether the Knackers Acts of 1786 and 1844 should be included. These Acts deal with the slaughter of animals not intended for human consumption, and it appears from the opening words of the earlier Act that that measure was directed chiefly against the stealing of horses. None the less, knackers&apos; yards and slaughter-houses are treated as a single subject throughout the Public Health Acts and the incorporated sections of the Towns Improvement Clauses Act, 1847, and we have thought it con-venient to include both in the present Bill. The adequate control of knackers&apos; yards is important in preventing meat unfit for human consumption being improperly disposed of for that purpose.7. In deciding what alterations of the law to recommend we have attempted to work on the principles which we adopted, and which were accepted by Parliament, in the case of the Local Government Act, 1933, and the Act of 1936. The Bill contains a large number of alterations of the law which, though more than drafting in character, are designed to simplify the law and to bring into accord with each other and with other modern legislation, the various provisions collected from some 29 Acts dating from the 18th century. At the same time we have recog-nised that many of the Acts which the Bill would replace, such as the Milk Acts, are of recent date, and for that reason we have been sparing in recommending amendments which on merits many of us would have been glad to suggest in a Bill of a different character. But in this connection it should be borne in mind that the Act of 1928 is purely consolidating and that the effective dates of its various sections are to be found in the dates of the Acts in chief, the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1875 which it consolidated. As regards the repeal of certain provisions of the old Tea and Coffee Acts we have had regard to .the recommendations in paragraph 41 of the Report of the Departmental Committee on the Composition and Description of Food (Cmd. 4564).In framing the Bill we have also incorporated some other alterations of the law recommended by other Committees. We refer to these in paragraphs 8, 29, 50, 52, 59 and 61.Local Legislation. 8. As before, we have considered how far clauses common in local Acts could properly be introduced into the Bill. Our task in this respect has been much facilitated by the work of the Committee, under the Chairmanship of Captain the Rt. Hon. R. C. Bourne, P.C., M.P., which was appointed in the spring of 1936 by the Chairman of Ways and Means.   The
Report of this Committee, dated 30th July, 1936, classifies a large number of common local Act clauses under three head-ings, namely, (a) clauses which can normally be accepted with-out special proof, (b) clauses which, subject to the alterations set out in the Report, may normally be accepted without special proof, and (c) clauses which should not be allowed without proof of local needs. &apos; These clauses are referred to throughout our Report as &quot; Standard Clauses &quot;. In a number of cases, to which attention is called in the Notes on Clauses, we have inserted in the draft Bill clauses from the first two of these categories. The third category is from its very nature unsuit-able for generalisation.Penalties.9. As in the case of the Public Health legislation which has now been superseded by the Act of 1936, the penalty provi-sions in the various Acts under review differ widely, both in their general design and as regards maximum penalties. Thus, Section 27 of the Act of 1928, which reproduces the provisions of the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1875, deals separately with first, second and subsequent offences, the maximum penalties being respectively  20,  50 and  100, or in the last case three months imprisonment &quot; if in the opinion of the court the offence was committed by the personal act, default, or culpable negligence-gence of the person accused, and the court is of opinion that a fine will not meet the circumstances of the case &quot;. Penalties for wilful breaches of regulations under the Public Health (Regulations as to Food) Act, 1907, are governed by Section 1, of the Public Health Act, 1896, now Section 143 of the Act of 1936, the maximum penalty being  100 and, in the case of a continuing offence,  50 a day. Section 18 of the Milk Act of 1915 provides a maximum fine of  5 for the first offence and ^50 for second or subsequent offences, and in the case of a con-tinuing offence 40s. a day. Section 9 of the Milk Act of 1922 is in similar terms. Penalties for offences under the Markets and Fairs Clauses Act, 1847, are substantially lower, the maxi-mum being  5 and for a continuing offence 40s. a day. Many other penalty provisions which it is unnecessary to enumerate are to be found scattered through other Acts.10. Following the principle stated in paragraph 17 of our Report on the draft Public Health Bill we have freely altered the maximum penalties with a view to securing a simphfication and assimilation of the law, but have at the same time recog-nised that different maxima are required for minor offences and for offences of a more serious character. Separate provisions for first, second and subsequent offences are rare in modern legislation and we have accordingly departed from this principle and adopted throughout the Bill a uniform general provision with a maximum penalty of  20 for the first offence, and  100
or three months imprisonment, or both, tor subsequent offences (Clause 79). Provisions such as appear in Section 27 of the Act of 1928 directing the court to inflict imprisonment, if it is of opinion that a fine will not meet the case, are, in our view, quite unnecessary.11. There are, however, a number of offences in Parts I to III of the Bill in which the penalties indicated above would be too severe or otherwise inappropriate. In these cases we have inserted a special penalty provision in the clause itself see Clauses 9, 13, 15, 17, 26 (4), 32 (5), 35 (6), 36, 38. In the case of Clause 9 (Penalty for sale, etc., of unsound food) which is one of the most important clauses of the Bill, we have thought it right to retain the provision in Section 117 of the Act of 1875 that the court should have power to inflict imprisonment for a term of not more than three months on the first offence.12. As explained in paragraph 53, Part IV of the Bill is to be read with the Customs Consolidation Act, 1876, and has been made self-contained. Separate provision is made for penalties for importation offences (Clause 42 (3) ), but the same principle has been adopted and (apart from the special alterna-tive pecuniary penalty varying according to the value of the imported articles) a maximum penalty of  20 for a first offence and  100 or three months imprisonment, or both, for subsequent offences is provided.13. Offences under Part V of the Bill are mainly of a minor character. The existing penalties vary from  1 to  5 and we have substituted a uniform penalty of  2, except as regards frauds in markets (Clause 56) for which the maximum penalty has been increased to  20 or three months imprisonment, or both, and contravention of the slaughter-house licensing pro-visions to which, as in the case of other clauses dealing with registration or licensing, the general penalty applies.14. We have dealt with offences under the three main codes of regulations the Food Regulations, the Milk and Dairies Regulations and the Bread and Flour Regulations by provid-ing in Clause 92 that penalties may be prescribed by the regula-tions themselves. This follows the principle adopted by Parlia-ment in Section 143 (5) of the Act of 1936. The power to prescribe is, however, limited by the clause to the maximum penalties for offences under the Bill. In view of the wide variety of offences under these regulations, we are satisfied that no single penalty clause could be framed which would be appropriate in all cases.Registration and Licensing. 15. The draft Bill reproduces no less than six different pro-visions for the registration or licensing of premises or persons. These are:  A. Registration of dairymen and dairies (Clause 18 (1) (a)).
B. Licensing of milk producers and purveyors to use special designations in relation to milk (Clause 19).C. Registration of premises for manufacture and sale of artificial cream (Clause 26).D. Registration of margarine and butter factories (Clause32). HI&quot;    - MNNE- Registration of premises for manufacture or sale of ice-cream,, preserved foods, etc. (Clause 35).F. Licensing of persons in respect of slaughter-houses and knackers&apos; yards (Clause 58).In attempting to reduce these various provisions to some degree of uniformity, we have found it necessary to consider the following points:  (1) Should the registration or licence attach to the person or the premises, or both?(2) If it attaches to the premises what procedure, if any, should be required on change of ownership or occupation?(3) Should the cancellation of registration or of a licence granted to a person in respect of premises affect any other premises in respect of which he may be registered or licensed ?(4) Is registration to be of right or is the registering authority to have a discretion to refuse registration, either absolute or on specified grounds ?We have reached the conclusion that it would not be possible to provide a single code in all these respects without making drastic and unnecessary alterations in the law.16. In three cases (those of the premises for the manufacture or sale of artificial cream, of margarine and butter factories, and of premises for the manufacture and sale of ice-cream, preserved foods, etc.) the existing enactments are directed to the premises and the primary aim of the legislature seems to have been to secure that the local authority should be aware that the premises were being used for the purpose in question, though in the last two of the three cases premises must comply with certain requirements, and failure to comply may lead to the cancellation of the registration. In these three cases it does not appear necessary to provide that a change of ownership or occupation should bring the registration to an end, but we have inserted provisions under which the local authority would receive notice of such a change. In the case of margarine and butter factories, this is already the law by virtue of orders made by the Local Government Board in 1900 and 1907 (S.R. &amp; O. 1900, No. 123 and S.R. &amp; O. 1907, No. 1021) under the enactment now con-tained in Section 8 of the Act of 1928.  It is also, in our view,
unnecessary in these cases to provide that the cancellation of registration shall affect any other registered premises in the same occupation, or the right to apply for registration in the future.17. As regards the registration of dairymen and dairies, Section 2 of the Milk Act of 1922 gives a power to an authority to refuse or revoke registration, and to a court to cancel registra-tion, but as respects retail milk purveyors only. This limita-tion does not, however, apply to London where under Sec-tion 185 of the London Act the power to refuse or revoke registration extends to all dairymen. The reason for the dis-tinction in this respect between retail purveyors and other dairy-men which is drawn in the provincial legislation is far from clear, as is also the reason for the difference between the law inside and outside London, but on the whole we have thought it advisable to reproduce the existing law without alteration.18. The licensing of milk producers and purveyors authorising the use of special designations is a matter for Milk and Dairies Regulations and not for the Bill itself. The present Milk (Special Designations) Order, 1936, provides for the licensing of a producer in respect of a specified herd and of a dealer in respect of milk obtained by him from a licensed establishment and sold by him at or from a specified address. In both cases licences are expressed to be &quot; not transferable &quot;.19. Licences for slaughter-houses and knackers&apos; yards are personal to the holder and relate to specified premises. The existing law with regard to licensed and registered slaughter-houses and knackers&apos; yards, which is very complicated, is dealt with in detail in paragraphs 55 to 60 below.20. Where registration is personal to the holder, it has been represented to us that information as to previous registration should be available when application for registration is made. The Bill accordingly provides for this in clauses 20 (5) and 58 (3).21. A point of practical difficulty was brought to our notice in connection with the registration of milk purveyors and dairies. The existing enactment (Section 2 of the Milk Act of 1922) pro-vides that on the refusal of registration by a local authority the applicant may appeal to a court of summary jurisdiction and from its decision to quarter sessions, and in the meantime may carry on his business. In some cases a registered company having applied for registration has proceeded to start and carry on a business pending a final refusal of the application by quarter sessions. The application having been refused the company then goes into liquidation, re-forms as a new company and proceeds de novo. This is an abuse which clearly should be stopped, but the position of a bona fide successor to a business
legitimately carried on must be safeguarded. Clause 90 has been drafted to meet this difficulty and applies generally to all registration and licensing provisions in the Bill.22. There is one other amendment and general assimilation of form which has been made in the registration provisions reproduced. The relevant clauses (excepting Clause 18 relating to milk where procedure will be set out in regulations) provide for an application being made by the &apos;&apos; occupier of, or a person proposing to occupy &quot; the premises concerned. The existing provisions relating to artificial cream, and to butter factories, etc. (including Standard Clause 94 relating to registration of ice-cream, etc.) refer to registration by the owner or occupier. It seems that the only case for which it is necessary to provide is that of premises which are, or are about to be, occupied, and that in that case the occupier or intending occupier should be the applicant.Food and Drugs Authorities.23. One of the most difficult questions which have called for consideration has been that of the authorities to administer the provisions of the Bill which reproduce the law now adminis-tered by &apos;&apos; Food and Drugs Authorities &apos;&apos;. This term is defined in Section 13 of the Act of 1928. As regards London, it means the Common Council of the City and the Metropolitan Borough Councils. Outside London the authorities are:   (a) county borough councils;(&amp;) councils of boroughs having for the time being a separate police establishment;(c) councils of boroughs which had a population of not less than 10,000 according to the 1881 census and had on the 13th August, 1888, and for the time being have, a separate court of quarter sessions;(d) elsewhere, the county council.Thus in London the number of administering authorities is 29 and outside London is 201, consisting of(a) 61 county councils;(6) 83 county borough councils;(c) 57 non-county borough councils, of which 49 have a separate police force and the remainder comply with the population test and had in 1888 and still have a separate court of quarter sessions. These include 41 boroughs with a population of less than 40,000 according to the last census, of which 18 had a population of less than 20,000.24. The subject was fully considered by the Royal Commis-sion on Local Government and is discussed in paragraphs 34-39 of their Final Report (1929, Cmd. 3436).   It was common
ground among the witnesses who appeared before them that the existing criteria were unsatisfactory. Amongst the sug-suggestions made to the Royal Commission we may mention the proposal of the Association of Municipal Corporations that the Act should be administered by the council of any borough having a medical officer of health precluded from engaging in private practice, and the proposal of the Minister of Health that the functions should be assigned to county councils and county borough councils, but that the Minister should be empowered by order to entrust the functions to urban authorities who employed a medical officer of health who was precluded from engaging in private practice. The Royal Commission summed up the matter in the following paragraphs:  &quot;38. It appears to us that the arguments are conclusive in favour of a simplification in the distribution of this ser-vice, and that the full powers and duties (comprising the appointment of an Analyst as well as the taking of samples) should be assigned to Authorities having jurisdiction over considerable areas; and we think that the Councils of Coun-ties and County Boroughs are the most suitable Authorities for this purpose. It is not, however, our intention that the Borough Councils who are now exercising these powers should entirely cease to do so; which, indeed, would clearly not be in accordance with the public interests. On the contrary, it is, in our opinion, desirable that they and the Councils of other County Districts should continue through their Medical Officers or other officers to take samples of food and drugs from time to time for the purpose of analysis, and should when necessary cause proceedings to be taken with a view to securing due observance of the Act. In order that Councils of County Districts may be encouraged and assisted in the performance of these func-tions, a County Council should have power to contribute towards the cost.&quot;&quot;39. We therefore recommend that: (i) The administration of the Food and Drugs (Adulteration) Act, 1928, and the appointment of Pub-lie Analysts should be assigned to County Councils and County Borough Councils;(ii) Councils of County Districts should retain the right to procure samples and take proceedings; and(iii) A County Council should be empowered, if they think fit, to contribute towards the cost incurred by a Council of a County District.&quot;25. After much discussion it became clear that the solution recommended by the Royal Commission was not acceptable to the members of the Committee who represent the Local Govern-ment Associations, and it was generally felt that, at any rate in
the absence of complete agreement, this recommendation in-volved too drastic an amendment of the law for the present Bill. On the other hand, it was clear that merely to reproduce the existing law would be wholly unsatisfactory. The size of the population of an area in 1881 is plainly out of date as a criterion for fitness to administer these Acts. Moreover, a definition in terms of boroughs having police establishments and courts of quarter sessions has become irrelevant in view of the fact that the service in question is now rightiy treated as a public health service rather than as a police matter.26. In our opinion the main factors in determining whether a local authority should be a Food and Drugs authority or not, are: (a) the extent to which the routine work of food inspec-tion and sampling in the area will represent something more than occasional duties for the officers engaged on the work, and(b) the standard which the authority have achieved in their public health arrangements.The first of these factors is mainly determined by the size of the population of the area and in this connection it is worth recording that the figures set out in paragraph 36 of the Report of the Royal Commission indicate that the number of samples examined in a year -is roughly 3 per 1,000 of the population. In judging the second it is relevant to consider whether the authority employ on the one hand a medical officer of health who is engaged exclusively in their employment, or exclusively in the employment of public authorities, or on the other hand, one who carries on a part-time private practice.27. Ultimately we came to the conclusion that a reasonable compromise might be secured by entrusting the functions to county councils, county borough councils, and the councils of urban areas (whether boroughs or urban districts) having a population according to the last published census of not less than 40,000, and empowering the Minister by order to confer them on the council of any other urban area with a popula-tion of not less than 20,000. In exercising this jurisdiction the Minister would, no doubt, have regard to the considerations to which we have referred.If our recommendation on this point is accepted, the effect will be to increase slightly the number of Food and Drugs autho-rities. At present there are, outside London, 57 of these authorities in addition to the 144 county and county borough councils. Out of these 57 the councils of 41 of the smaller areas with a population of less than 40,000 would cease to be Food and Drugs authorities, except in so far as the Minister thought fit to exercise his order-making power.   On the other hand,46610 a*
48 councils of areas with a population of 40,000 or more would become Food and Drugs authorities with a resulting increase, on balance, of 7.Clause 64 of the Bill gives effect to this recommendation. Under Clauses 68 and 65 the existing right of county district councils who are not Food and Drugs authorities to procure samples and take proceedings is preserved in accordance with the recommendation of the Royal Commission, and by Clause 75 (5) power is conferred on county councils to contribute towards the cost.Regulation-making Powers. 28. In dealing with regulation-making powers we have followed the principles referred to in paragraph 15 of our Second Interim Report. Accordingly, in the case of the three principal sets of regulations the Food Regulations, the Milk and Dairies Regulations, and the Bread and Flour Regulations provision is made for the regulations being laid before Parliament, and the usual power for each House to annul the regulations by an Address to His Majesty is given by the incorporation of Sec-tion 319 of the Act of 1936 by Clause 96. The same procedure has been adopted for regulations prescribing the qualifications of public analysts (Clause 66) and those relating to the corn-position of milk (Clause 21). The former are comparable to those under Section 103 of the Local Government Act, 1933, prescribing the qualifications of medical officers of health, which must be laid before Parliament and are liable to annulment.29. One further point may be noted in this connection. The Report of the Departmental Committee on Ministers&apos; Powers, 1932 (Cmd. 4060), recommended on page 64 of their Report that the term &quot; regulation &quot; should be used to describe the instrument by which the power to make substantive law is exer-cised, and the term &quot; order &quot; to describe the instrument of the exercise of (a) executive power, and (6.) the power to take judicial and quasi-judicial decisions. In view of this recom-mendation, we have substituted the term &quot; Milk and Dairies Regulations &quot; for the term &quot; Milk and Dairies Orders &quot; which occurs throughout the Milk Act of 1915, since these so-called orders are in fact elaborate codes of substantive law. We have also used this term to describe the rules governing the use of special designations under Section 3 of the Milk Act of 1922 as re-enacted in Section 10 of the Milk Act, 1934.The &quot; Warranty Defence.&quot;30. The so-called &quot; warranty defence &quot; is dealt with in Section 29 of the Act of 1928 (Clause 84 of the Bill).The position under that section is as follows. Under para-graph (a) of Subsection (1), in a prosecution under Part II. of
the Act for &quot; dealing with, selling, exposing or offering for sale, or having in his possession for sale margarine, margarine-cheese or milk-blended butter &quot;, the defendant is to be dis-charged, if he proves that he had purchased the article as butter or cheese, with a written warranty or invoice to that effect, that he had no reason to believe that the article was other than butter or cheese, and that the article was in the same state as when he purchased it.This paragraph extends to invoices as well as warranties, and covers a number of offences besides the sale of an article. On the other hand it is limited to offences under Part II. of the Act and to the three named articles.Paragraph (&amp;) of Section 29 (1) covers articles of all kinds and offences under all Parts of the Act, but is limited to the offence of selling and makes no reference to invoices. Under this provision the defendant is entitled to be discharged, if he can show that he purchased the article as the same in nature, substance and quality as that demanded of him, and with a written warranty to that effect, that he had no reason to believe when he sold it that it was otherwise, and that he sold it in the same state as when he purchased it.The &quot; warranty defence &quot; is, in effect, a device for enabling a defendant who is not the actual manufacturer or producer of the article in question to secure acquittal by proving an absence of &quot; intent &quot;. In this respect it is closely akin to the provisions reproduced in Clause 83 of the Bill, which are designed to exempt from penalty a defendant whose offence is technical only and to secure the conviction of the real culprit.31. It is in our view impossible to justify the differences, to which we have drawn attention, between the two paragraphs of Section 29 (1). They are clearly the result of combining different Acts of Parliament in a measure which was limited to strict consolidation of the existing law. The proper course appears to be to put invoices on the same footing as warranties and to make the warranty defence available in the case of all prosecu-tions under the Bill relating to the sale or offering or exposing, for sale or having in possession for sale any food or drug. As regards the first proposal invoices to be equivalent to warranties it should be observed that the Departmental Com-mittee on the Composition and Description of Food in paragraph 30 of their Report (Cmd. 4564) recommended an amendment of the law in this sense and Clause 84 (5) of the Bill so provides.The question of the warranty defence in connection with importation offences is dealt with in paragraph 53.We are satisfied that if the warranty defence is thus extended, the proviso to Section 1 (3) of the Act of 1928 should be omitted.  The effect of this proviso is to enable the defendant in46610 A* 2
a prosecution for selling any food or drug, mixed, coloured, stained, etc., to secure acquittal, if he shows that he did not know and could not with reasonable diligence have ascertained that the food or drug was mixed, coloured, stained, etc. The proviso has always been something of an anomaly, since there is no corresponding defence under Sections 2 or 5 of the Act, nor under any of the numerous provisions of a similar kind repro-duced in the Bill, e.g., Section 116 of the Act of 1875 and Section 4 of the Milk Act of 1922.We have also provided for the repeal without re-enactment of Section 33 of the Act of 1928. The main part of that section, which enacts that save as otherwise expressly provided nothing in the Act is to affect contracts, appears to be unnecessary, and the object at which the proviso is aimed is, in our view, sufficiently met by the. right of the defendant to plead a warranty.Definition of food for sale for human consumption. 32. Throughout the Bill the expression &quot; for human con-sumption &quot; has been substituted for a variety of expressions, such as, &quot; for the food of man &quot;.A more important assimilation has been effected by the pro-vision in Clause 100 (2) (b) that &quot; any reference to food of any kind sold or offered, exposed, intended or in preparation, for sale for human consumption shall be construed as including a reference to that food sold, or offered, exposed, intended or in preparation for sale, for the manufacture of products for human consumption &quot;.In a number of sections in the Milk Acts reference is made to milk intended for sale &quot; for use in the manufacture of products for human consumption &quot; (see Sections 1 (1) (h) and (i), 5 (&amp;) and 19 (2) of the Milk Act of 1915 and Section 8 (1) of the Milk Act of 1922). In the other enactments reproduced in the Bill no reference is made to the manufacture of products. If the Bill were to reproduce these enactments verbatim, we think it probable that the result would be to make a substantial alteration in the law, since the inference might fairly be drawn that where any reference to the manufacture of products was omitted, the term &quot; for human consumption &quot; did not extend to cover manu-facture of products. We feel little doubt, however, that, under the existing law, the offence of selling unsound food is com-mitted, notwithstanding that the intention may be that after sale the food is to be manufactured into some other product before being consumed. Clause 100 (2) (6) has been drafted to meet this point.33. There is a further class of case which presents some difficulty, namely, the case where the intention is that before sale the food is to be manufactured by the person in whose
possession it is into products for sale by him. That case is largely covered in Section 116 of the Act of 1875 (reproduced in Clause 9 of the Bill) by the words &quot; for the purpose of . . . preparation for sale &quot;. We are satisfied that it would not be right to cover this case by inserting in Clause 100 any general definition in terms of manufacture of products. In connection with some clauses of the Bill it would indeed produce a strange result, e.g., under Clause 22 it would become an offence to add water to milk in the process of making a cake for sale. The Bill accordingly deals with this case by express words in Clauses 8, 9 (where the language of the Act of 1875 &quot; preparation for sale &quot; is reproduced), 18, and 23.It is to be observed that Section 5 of the Milk Act of 1915, reproduced in the last-mentioned clause, uses the words &quot; if a person . . . uses ... in the manufacture of products for human consumption the milk of any cow, etc.&quot;, there being no reference to sale. The curious result of this language is that if milk from a tuberculous cow is drunk in its natural state the offence is limited by the earlier words of the section to the case of &quot; sale &quot; or &quot; offering for sale &quot;, but there is no corresponding limitation, if the milk is manufactured into products. In the latter case an offence is committed notwithstanding that there has been no sale. There is no other example in the legislation reproduced in the Bill of an offence in respect of products neither sold nor intended for sale, except in certain of the order-making powers reproduced in Clause 18. We understand, however, that the orders made under these powers have been limited to milk intended for sale. We have accordingly inserted in Clause 23 a reference to sale so as to bring it into line with the remainder of the Bill.Compensation.34. The question of compensation for loss or damage result-ing from the exercise of the various powers of the Bill is one which presents some difficulty. The existing law is as follows:   (a) In so far as the Bill reproduces sections from the Public Health Acts, Section 308 of the Act of 1875 applies. There has, however, never been any provision correspond-ing to that section in the London law.   The provisions of the Public Health Acts reproduced in the Bill with which Section 308 has been most closely associated are Sections 116 and 117 of the Act of 187^ (Clauses 9 and 10).  Sec-tion 308 provides for compensation where a person sustains damage by reason of the exercise of the powers of the Act in relation to a matter as to which he is not himself in default; and it has been held in Hobbs v. Winchester Corporation [1910], 2 K.B. 471, that where meat was con-demned as unsound the defendant was liable to conviction 46610 A* 3
under Section 117, whether or not he was aware of the un- &quot; soundness of the meat, and, further, that as he sold the unsound meat at his peril, he was in default within the meaning of Section 308 if the meat was unsound, however innocent of wrongful intent he might have been, and conse-quently that he was not entitled to compensation.(b) Section 3 of, and paragraph 14 of the First Schedule to, the Milk Act of 1915 provide for compensation to a dairyman for loss sustained by the making of an order prohibiting the supply of milk likely to cause tuberculosis, unless the order is made in consequence of his own default or neglect, and further for compensation for loss due to the authority unreasonably neglecting or refusing to withdraw an order.(c) None of the other Acts reproduced in the Bill con-tains any provision for compensation.35. On a consideration of the existing law it became clear to us that it would be quite improper to insert any general com-pensation clause on the lines of Section 308 of the Act of 1875 or Section 278 of the Act of 1936, which replaces it so far as regards the subject matter of that Act, and that in any case in which a right to compensation ought to be provided the neces-sary provision must be inserted in the clause itself. Further, we felt that it was not practicable to make so drastic an amend-ment of the law as would be involved in importing into the legis-lation applying to London a clause in such wide terms as Sec-tion 308. On the other hand, it is impossible to justify a distinc-tion in this particular respect between the law inside and outside London.36. We accordingly decided to insert a compensation provi-sion in the clause (Clause 10) dealing with the seizure of un-sound food, limiting it, on the principle of the Hobbs v. Win-chester Corporation decision (supra), to the case of food which has been mistakenly seized and which the justice has accordingly refused to condemn, and defining the compensation in terms of the depreciation in the value of the food resulting from its seizure and removal.  It is to be noted also that the clause as drafted coupled with Clause 86 relating to the mode of arbitra-tion-does not allow of the question of unfitness being brought before the arbitrator.  There is some doubt as to the existence of such a right at present.  In Walshaw v. Brighouse Corpora-tion [1899] 2 Q.B. 286 it was held that meat found unfit by a justice might later (after destruction) be held by the arbitrator to have been fit.  The court in Hobbs v. Winchester Corpora-tion (supra) did not have to give a decision on this point, but gave a clear indication that there was doubt in their minds whether such a matter was within the province of the arbitrator.
We think it undesirable that a justice&apos;s decision as to unfitness (given when the food is before him) should be reversed by an arbitrator (possibly some months after destruction), and the Bill accordingly provides that compensation shall be based only on the justice&apos;s decision.The same principle has been adopted in Clause 17, the local authority being required to compensate only if the medical officer of health by withdrawing his notice admits that further investigation has shown his suspicion to be unfounded, or if the justice refuses to condemn the food.37. In Clause 36, which is founded on Standard Clause 95, the compensation provision proceeds on a different basis. In this case the medical officer of health is empowered to place a &quot; stop order &quot; on suspected ice-cream and, if he thinks it necessary, to have it destroyed. The circumstances in this case make any reference of the matter to a justice impossible and it is not unreasonable that, in any case in which the manu-facturer or dealer is not himself in default, the local authority should compensate him for his loss, unless they can prove that the ice-cream was in fact infected.  The clause so provides.38. Clause 62, which is based on a local Act clause and enables a local authority to secure the elimination of private slaughter-houses on payment of compensation, presents no special problems. The compensation is analogous to compensa-tion for compulsory purchase (see also paragraph 61).39. The question of compensation for action taken under regulations is a more difficult matter. Provision for compensa-tion is to be found in some of the existing regulations and orders, though there is no express authority for it in the statutes: Following Section 1 (1) (&amp;) of the Public Health (Regulations as to Food) Act, 1907 for it must be on the power given by that subsection that the right to compensation conferred by the existing Milk and Dairies Order is based we have inserted in Clause 92 (2) (&amp;) a power for the three principal sets of regulations to apply, with necessary modifications, provisions of the Bill and other Acts, dealing with matters similar to those dealt with in the regulations. This will enable the regulations to provide for compensation in suitable cases.PART i.GENERAL PROVISIONS AS TO FOOD AND DRUGS. Composition and Description of Food.40. In preparing this Part of the Bill we have thought it right to take account of the Report (Cmd. 4564) made in April, 1934, by the Departmental Committee on the Composition and46610 A* 4
Description of Food, appointed to consider whether the law relating to the composition and description of articles of food should be altered so as to enable definitions or standards to be prescribed or declarations of composition to be required for articles of food other than liquid milk. The committee answered this question in the affirmative and recommended that the enabling power should be vested in the Minister of Health and the Department of Health for Scotland. Their Report then proceeds as follows:  &quot; 19. At the same time we wish to state that in our opinion the case for the extension of standards or defini-tions to all articles of food is not made out. We consider that in a large number of cases the housewife to-day gets an article of the nature, substance, and quality she demands and that she would not be benefited by a multitude of stan-dards, definitions or declarations of composition. We are satisfied, however, that in some cases standards or declara-tions of composition or definitions of some kind are neces-sary for the protection of the consumer.20. We think the main thing to be aimed at is that the public, when buying any important article of food, should know what they are getting. A considerable amount of elasticity must be allowed in the preparation of many articles, and we should recommend that the power to fix standards or definitions should only be used where it is shown that it is necessary for the protection of the public health (including nutrition) or the protection of the pocket of the consumer.&quot;We have incorporated in Clause 8 of the Bill, which repro-duces the regulation-making powers of the Public Health (Regu-lations as to Food) Act, 1907, provisions to give effect to this recommendation.41. In paragraph 28 of the same Report the committee deal with the question of advertisements of a misleading nature and quote the following recommendation made to them by the Food Manufacturers&apos; Federation, Patent and Proprietary Foods Section:  &quot; It is our opinion that any attempt to control by statute statements about the composition of food will be stultified unless it is legally enacted that, for purposes of evidence as to the nature, quality and substance demanded of a food, specific claims made in advertisements shall be deemed to be part of the package label. Though it is theoretically true that the purchaser is expected to examine the label of a product before he completes its purchase, it is a matter of common knowledge that the vast majority of purchasers do not do so.   The description on which they
have been induced to buy the product is, in a large number of cases, only that contained in the advertisements, and we hold very strongly that progress in the standardisation and description of food will be seriously hampered until this matter is dealt with.&quot;The Report adds that the committee agreed with the prin-ciple of this recommendation. We have inserted a provision which deals with this point and is discussed in more detail in the note on Clause 6.Sections 1-5 of the Act of 1928.   , 42. A close examination of Sections 1, 2, 4 and 5 of the Act of 1928 revealed several inconsistencies, and some amendment in the drafting has been necessary to reduce these to a minimum. The changes are dealt with fully in the notes on Clauses 1-5.Section 3 of the Act of 1928 makes it an offence to sell any &quot; compound article of food or any compounded drug which is not composed of ingredients in accordance with the demand of the purchaser &quot;. It is to be noted that this section, unlike Section 2, does not contain the words &quot; to the prejudice of the purchaser &quot;. It was pointed out by the court in Beardsley v. Walton &amp; Co. [1900], 2 Q.B.I that an offence under the section was also punishable under Section 2 (reproduced in Clause 3 of the Bill), and it seems probable that the section originated in a drafting error in Section 6 of the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1875. We are satisfied that it serves no useful purpose. The Bill accordingly repeals it without re-enactment.PART II.PROVISIONS AS TO MILK, DAIRIES AND ARTIFICIALCREAM.43. This Part of the Bill mainly consists of provisions repro-duced from the Milk Acts of 1915, 1922 and 1934. In dealing with certain sections of earlier legislation relating to milk we were confronted by the fact that the scope of the Milk and Dairies Orders which can be made under the Milk Acts of 1915 and 1922 is amply wide enough to cover the subject matter of these provisions. Further, it became plain on exami-nation of the terms of the Milk and Dairies Order, 1926, that provisions supplemental and closely analogous to the sections are to be found in the Order, with the result that what should, for convenience of administration, be a single code is at present split into two parts one to be found in the Statute Book, the other in the Order. One possible course was to reproduce cer-tain provisions of the Order in the Bill, and in the early drafts
of the Bill this plan was in fact adopted. We found, however, that it was open to various objections. In the first place, it lengthened and complicated the Bill by the inclusion of provi-sions which Parliament has thought more appropriate to statutory orders. Secondly, the insertion in the Bill of provi-sions which are clearly within the scope of regulation-making powers is unsatisfactory as a matter of drafting, and may well cause an unduly restricted interpretation to be placed on these powers. Further, it may fairly be said that by the legislation of 1915 and 1922 Parliament decided that the more elastic pro-cedure of orders is more appropriate to their subject matter; and it is to be noted that the order-making powers conferred by these Acts are certainly not wider than the regulation-making powers conferred by the Public Health (Regulations as to Food) Act, 1907, (reproduced in Clause 8 of the Bill), or by Section 134 of the Act of 1875 or Section 1 of the Public Health Act, 1896, (now Section 143 of the Act of 1936).The Bill accordingly repeals without re-enactment Section 4 of the Infectious Disease (Prevention) Act, 1890, and Sections 53 and 54 of the Act of 1907. The subject matter of these sections is to some extent covered by the Milk and Dairies Order, 1926, and can, if necessary, be fully covered by regulations under Clause 18 of the Bill, which reproduces the order-making powers of the Milk Act of 1915.44. Attention should also be drawn to another group of pro-visions Sections 3 and 4 of the Milk Act of 1915 and the First Schedule to that Act which the Bill repeals without re-enact-ment. Section 3 and the Schedule provide a code under which the medical officer of health may stop the supply of milk in cases where he is of opinion that the consumption of the milk is causing or is likely to cause tuberculosis. We understand that in these cases local authorities have, in practice, always made use of the corresponding powers given by the Tuber-culosis Order of 1925 (made under the Diseases of Animals Acts), and caused the infected cows to be isolated or slaughtered, and that consequently the power under the Milk Act of 1915 to stop the supply of milk is unnecessary and is never exercised.Section 4 of the Milk Act of 1915 supplements the provisions of Section 3 by imposing on the medical officer of health of the area in which the milk is produced, the duty of making the necessary investigations on receipt of a notice from the medical officer of health of an area in which the milk is consumed. Whatever may have been the conditions when these sections were enacted, we are of opinion that the imposition of an express duty in these circumstances is now unnecessary. In this connection it may be observed that, as regards the actual inspection of cattle, Section 19 (3) of the Agriculture Act, 1937, places the services of the veterinary inspectors of the Ministry
of Agriculture and Fisheries at the disposal of local authorities, and we are satisfied that Section 4, like Section 3 and the First Schedule, may safely be omitted.45. Milk has been denned throughout (except where the con-text otherwise requires) as including cream and separated milk and the latter term also includes skimmed milk. In this the language of the Milk Act of 1915 has been followed, but it should be noted that there is no such definition in the Milk Act of 1922 or the Act of 1928 (except in the Second Schedule thereto). The advantages of a single comprehensive definition throughout the Bill are however obvious.PART   111.PROVISIONS AS TO OTHER KINDS OF FOOD. The Bread Acts. 46. The only existing statute law which deals specifically with the subject of bread is to be found in the Bread Act, 1822, the Bread Act, 1836, and the Bread Acts Amendment Act, 1922. The first of these Acts was confined to London, and the object of the second was to extend that legislation to the country as a whole. A number of sections of both Acts have already been repealed. Put shortly, the effect of the outstanding sections (other than those relating to procedure, penalties, etc.) is as follows: Sections 2 and 8 of the Act of 1836 make it an offence to sell bread made with any ingredient or matter other than&apos;-certain specified ingredients including flour or meal of wheat, barley, rye, oats, buckwheat, Indian corn, peas, beans, rice and potatoes.Section 5 provides that avoirdupois weight shall be used for the sale of bread.Section 9 makes it an offence to put into flour any ingredient or mixture not being the real and genuine produce of corn or grain, or to sell any flour which has been mixed with any such ingredient.Section 12 renders the occupier of a bakehouse or flour-mill liable to a penalty if adulterants are found on the premises and he cannot satisfy the court that they were not intended to be added to bread or flour.Section 14 (a section occupying nearly a page and a half of the Statute Book) prohibits baking on the Lord&apos;s Day, except between certain hours.The outstanding sections of the Act of 1822 contain similar provisions.
47- The effect of the Bread Acts Amendment Act, 1922, is to remove the prohibition imposed by the Acts of 1822 and 1836 against the addition of ingredients designed to make flour self-raising (a practice which had for long been common), and to permit further additions to self-raising flour of ingredients suitable for the making of cakes or puddings, subject to the right of the Minister by regulations under the Public Health (Regula-tions as to Food) Act, 1907, to prohibit or restrict particular ingredients and to prescribe the descriptions under which flour to which substances had been added might be sold.48. It has also to be remembered that bread and flour, like other food, fall within the scope of the Act of 1928 and of the Public Health Acts.49. The Departmental Committee on the Composition and Description of Food stated in paragraph 41 of their Report:  &quot; We also think that consideration should be given to the question of replacing the two Acts of 1822 and 1836 (dealing with the composition of bread and flour) by new legislation more suited to present-day conditions.&quot; Even apart from this consideration, however, it became clear to us that either to leave these Acts outstanding or to incorporate them as they stand in the Bill would be unsatisfactory, more particularly for the reason that since the legislation of 1907 a large portion of their subject matter is covered by regulation-making powers. On the other hand, in view of the vital importance of maintaining a high standard in the quality of bread and flour it seemed inadvisable merely to repeal the Acts and to leave the matter to be dealt with in the general Food Regulations. We have come to the conclusion that the proper course is to repeal without re-enactment the two earlier Acts (except Section 12 of the Act of 1836 and the corresponding provision in the Act of 1822, as to which see paragraph 51 be-low) and slightly to widen the scope of the regulation-making power under the Act of 1922 so as to enable the Minister to make Bread and Flour Regulations covering the whole field (Clause 28).50. We are not strictiy concerned with the subject of Sunday baking (Section 14 of the Bread Act, 1836, and Section 16 of the Bread Act, 1822, (London) ), but in view of the finding of the Departmental Committee on Night Baking, in paragraph 61 of their report (Cmd. 5525), that these provisions &quot; appear to be in desuetude &quot; we have provided for their repeal. The subject matter of Sections 5 of the Acts of 1822 and 1836 use of avoirdupois weight is also not within our province, but the Board of Trade advised us that they are now obsolete, and Clause 98 provides for their repeal. Both these Acts are repealed in toto except, in the case of the Act of 1836, as regards Scotland.
PART IV.PROVISIONS AS TO IMPORTATION OF CERTAINPRODUCE.53. Our original intention was to confine this Part, like the remainder, of the Bill to England and Wales, but in course of drafting it became apparent that if this were done it would, in order to prevent the provisions of the Bill, in so far as they widen the law, being to some extent rendered nugatory,^ be necessary to create a new offence of importing margarine,51. Section 12 of the Act of 1836, and the corresponding provision in the Act of 1822, which place on the occupier of a bakery or mill the onus of proving that any prohibited materials found on the premises are kept there for a legitimate purpose, is reproduced in a shortened form in Clause 29 of the Bill.Treatment of flour with chemical substances. 52. Our attention was also drawn to the Report made in 1927 by a Departmental Committee appointed by the then Minister of Health which sat under the chairmanship of Sir Horace Monro and considered the question &quot; whether and to what extent the practice of treating flour with chemical substances is objectionable on grounds of health and whether it is desir-able in the interests of the public health that the practice should be prohibited or restricted and, in the latter case, what restric-tions should be imposed &quot;. In the concluding paragraphs of their Report the Committee state that they are &quot; not prepared, on the present knowledge available, to recommend the complete elimination of the bleaching agents and improvers now in use &quot;. &quot; Our view is &quot;, the Report continues, &quot; that in the first instance it should suffice to limit the use of these substances to those which appear least open to objection when judged along the lines we have indicated &quot;. After pointing out that much could be done by the trade itself, the Report ends with the suggestion that it should be compulsory for the manufac-turers of chemical substances for use either as bleaching agents or improvers, or both, to declare to their purchasers the nature of the ingredients of which they are composed, and that millers should be required to inform their customers whether, their flour has undergone a process of chemical bleaching or improving and, if so, with what substances and in what proportion. In order to meet these points, we have included in Clause 28 of the Bill amongst the matters which may be dealt with in Bread and Flour Regulations, provisions prohibiting or restricting, either absolutely or subject to conditions, the addition of any substance, or the application of any treatment, to flour intended for sale.
etc., from Scotland, Northern Ireland and the Isle of Man, into England and Wales. Although our Terms of Reference do not extend beyond England and Wales, we have given this matter some consideration and have reached the conclusion that the most convenient course would be to apply Part IV of the Bill to the &quot; United Kingdom &quot;, a term which for customs purposes by virtue of Section 277 of the Customs Con-solidation Act, 1876, includes the Isle of Man. We have, accordingly, followed the Act of 1928 and drafted the Bill pro-visionally on these lines, Part IV being applied to the whole of the United Kingdom by Clause 43, but the point will no doubt receive consideration by the Departments concerned.A further and more important matter will no doubt also receive consideration. Under paragraphs (c) and (i) of Clause 40 it is an offence to import certain foods if they do not comply with regulations made under the Bill, and under Subsection (4) of Clause 42, compliance or non-compliance with regulations is made a criterion of the adulteration or impoverishment of food. The question arises whether importation into Scotland, Northern Ireland and the Isle of Man, should be governed by regulations made under an English Act, or by regulations operating in the countries named. In the latter case a high degree of uniformity between regulations in the various coun-tries would seem to be necessary. For this and other reasons, it may prove to be convenient that the regulation-making powers in Clauses 8 and 28 of the Bill (Food Regulations and Bread and Flour Regulations) should be made to apply to Scotland, as well as to England and Wales, in the same way as the existing regulation-making powers, since, as already indicated, the powers under these clauses widen those powers.As respects Northern Ireland and the Isle of Man, however, the course to be adopted will no doubt receive consideration by the authorities concerned.The provisions of the Bill requiring further consideration have been inserted in square brackets.Clause 43, following Section 12 of the Act of 1928, provides that Part IV of the Bill is to be construed as one with the Customs Consolidation Act, 1876, but the words &quot; subject to the provisions of this Act &quot; which appear in Section 12 have been omitted. Their meaning is doubtful and has given rise to a good deal of difficulty, see R. v. Otto Monsted Ltd. [1906] 2 K.B. 456. The better course appeared to us to be to insert in Part IV itself any general provisions with regard to legal proceedings, etc., which ought to apply to importation offences. In this connection we considered, in particular, whether the &quot; warranty defence &quot; should apply to this class of offence, a matter which came before the court in Kelly v. Lonsdale &amp; Co. [1906] 2 K.B. 486.  The language of Section 29 of the Act of
1928 on this point is not easy to construe, but we understand that the Commissioners of Customs and Excise are not aware of any importation case in recent times in which the defendant has sought to avail himself of this defence, and we have accordingly not incorporated the warranty provision in this Part of the Bill.These and a number of further points on Part IV of the Bill are dealt with in the notes on Clauses 40-42.PART   V.MARKETS, SLAUGHTER-HOUSES AND COLD-AIRSTORES.Markets.54. The public health law relating to markets is to be found in Sections 166-168 of the Act of 1875 which incorporate cer-tain sections of the Markets and Fairs Clauses Act, 1847, and in the Public Health Act, 1908, which enables a rural district council, with the consent of the Minister of Health, to estab-lish a market. The incorporated provisions of the Act of 1847 are Sections 12-16 and 21-42. On consideration of these sections it appeared to us likely that some at least of their provisions might be obsolete, and with the assistance of the Association of Municipal Corporations and the Urban and Rural District Coun-cils Associations we addressed a number of questions to some 30 councils representing all types of local authorities who carry on markets under the Public Health Acts. The information thus obtained has satisfied us that a great simplification of the pro-visions of the Act of 1847 could be made without the loss of any effective powers, and, in particular, that it is safe to omit provisions reproducing Sections 12, 31, 32 and 39 of that Act.We have also thought it unnecessary to repeat the substance of Section 29 (3) of the Act of 1847 which expressly requires that a weight ticket shall be given by the weighing machine keeper to a buyer or seller on request.Such of the provisions of the Markets and Fairs Clauses Act, 1847, as were applied by the Act of 1875 and are still operative, we have included in the Bill instead of following the method of incorporation by reference adopted in the Act of 1875. A number of places in which the language of the original sections has been abbreviated or otherwise changed are referred to in the notes on Clauses 44-57.Slaughter-houses and Knackers&apos; Yards. 55. The Public Health Acts treat slaughter-houses and knackers&apos; yards as a single subject, the term &quot; slaughter-house &quot; being defined in Section 4 of the Act of 1875 as includ-ing places &quot; commonly called knackers&apos; yards &quot;.   Section 169
of the same Act empowers urban authorities to provide slaughter-houses, and incorporates Sections 125-131 of the Towns Improvement Clauses Act, 1847, which relate to slaughter-houses and knackers&apos; yards.Put shortly, the effect of these sections is as follows. By Section 125 the Commissioners [i.e., the body empowered to execute any Act with which the Act of 1847 was incorporated, and thus under the Act of 1875, the local authority) are em-powered to license slaughter-houses and knackers&apos; yards. Sec-tion 126 provides that, unless licensed, a place is not to be used as a slaughter-house or knacker&apos;s yard unless so used &quot; at the passing of the special Act &quot;. Section 127 requires existing slaughter-houses and knackers&apos; yards to be registered. Sec-tion 128 empowers the Commissioners to make byelaws for various purposes connected with slaughter-houses and knackers&apos; yards, and Section 129 empowers justices to suspend or revoke licences or forbid for a period the use of registered premises in the event of the occupier being convicted of breaches of the Act or byelaws. The remaining two sections relate to penalties and to entry, inspection and seizure of unfit carcases.Under Section 29 of the Act of 1890 licences for slaughter-houses (including knackers&apos; yards) granted after the adoption of Part III of that Act were made temporary (the minimum period being 12 months) and Section 31 of the same Act pro-vided for the revocation of a licence on conviction of the occupier of the premises for the sale of meat unfit for food.56. As regards local authorities, the provisions of the Act of 1847 referred to above came into operation on many different dates, namely:  (a) the date of any local Act incorporating the provi-sions;(&amp;) the date on which the authority or their predecessors adopted the Local Government Act, 1858 (i.e., a date not earlier than the 2nd August, 1858);(c) the date of the passing of the Act of 1875 (i.e., the nth August, 1875);(d) the date on which the place became included in a borough or urban district;(e) the date on which a rural district council were in-vested with the urban powers of Section 169 of the Act of 1875; or(/) the date on which the Rural District Councils (Slaughter-houses) Order, 1924 (S.R.O. No. 1431), an order investing rural district councils generally with these powers, came into operation (ist January, 1925).
Section 29 of the Act of 1890, together with other slaughter-house powers, has been adopted in all but 65 urban areas and has been put into force in all rural districts.The effect is that there are at present three classes of slaughter-houses and knackers&apos; yards, viz.:  (a) those registered, i.e., those which were in existence at the material date set out above and have continued in use ever since;(b) those licensed without Umitation of time; and(c) those licensed after the adoption of the Act of 1890 for periods of not less than one year.57. It was held in Goodwin v. Sale [1907] 2 K.B. 278 that a licence under the Towns Improvement Clauses Act, 1847, is related both to the slaughter-house and to the occupier, and accordingly that it would cease to operate on the death of the occupier or on any change of occupation. In view of the general adoption of the Act of 1890 it is probable that there are now very few licences operating under (b) without limit of time.In London all slaughter-houses and knackers&apos; yards are sub-ject to annual licensing (Sections 144 and 145 of the London Act).58. The considerations mentioned above lead to the conclu-sion that all licences might, following the principle adopted in the Act of 1890, be made temporary and to this end Clause 58 of the Bill provides that licences shall not be given for longer periods than 13 months. As regards slaughter-houses which are not registered slaughter-houses, the existing discretion of a local authority to refuse to grant or renew a licence for any reason is retained, but a right of appeal to a court of summary jurisdiction and further appeal to quarter sessions as in the registration clauses of the Bill is given.59. The position of registered premises, that is, premises used as a slaughter-house or knacker&apos;s yard before the date on which the Towns Improvement Clauses Act, 1847, came into operation in the area, and continuously so used since that date, is more difficult, but on the whole we came to the conclusion that the proper course was to make these premises also subject to a temporary licence, but to recognise their peculiar position by providing for the automatic renewal of the licence unless the authority are satisfied that the premises are unsuitable for use, or that the applicant is not a proper person to keep a slaughter-house or knacker&apos;s yard. In support of this course it may be mentioned that registered slaughter-houses and knackers&apos; yards being the oldest are generally the least satisfactory from a structure-tural point of view, and that the Departmental Committee on Meat Inspection which reported in July, 1921, recommended in paragraph 51 of their Report that &quot; the occupiers of all
private slaughter-houses should be required to obtain an annual licence from the local authority &quot;. .60. As regards knackers&apos; yards, licences under the Knackers Acts of 1786 and 1844 were annual, and accordingly the case for bringing them under the ordinary licensing provision is still stronger.61. The desirability of reducing the number of private slaughter-houses was referred to in the Report of the Depart-mental Committee on Meat Inspection (supra), and also in the Report of the Committee of the Economic Advisory Council on the Slaughtering of Livestock (published in 1933). In. view of the recommendations of these Committees and of the general policy underlying the Livestock Industry Act, 1937, we have included in the draft Bill a clause (Clause 62) based on a com-mon local Act clause which provides for the elimination of private slaughter-houses (a) by purchase by agreement; (b) by closure by agreement; and (c) on the provision of adequate public slaughter-house accommodation, by a resolution of a local authority, to be approved by the Minister, that after a specified date existing licences shall cease to have effect and no further licences shall be granted.As regards (c), however, we have added a further provision that specified premises may be exempt from the operation of the resolution and, as a corollary, that fresh licences may be granted with the Ministers approval. A somewhat similar provision is contained in Section 25 (1) (c) of the Livestock Industry Act, 1937. To give these premises adequate security, the clause provides that the Minister may attach conditions, including a condition that for a specified period a renewal of the licence is not to be refused unless the continuation of the use of the premises becomes unsuitable by reason of unsuitability of the occupier or otherwise.Provision is made for compensation in all cases where a slaughter-house is compulsorily closed (see paragraph 38). Local legislation has not been consistent on this point. Before 1920 such a provision was common, but since that date the right to compensation has in some cases been conferred generally and in others been limited to slaughter-houses existing before a specified date, or to registered slaughter-houses. We reached the conclusion that, subject to the safeguard in the proviso to Subsection (6) of the clause (Clause 62) which requires the arbitrator to have regard to the structural and sanitary condition of the slaughter-house, the proper course is to confer a general right to compensation for loss sustained by the closing of the slaughter-house. It must be remembered that, though the authority have a discretion in granting or refusing a licence, a refusal will be subject to appeal to a court of summary jurisdiction and a further appeal to quarter sessions. This secures that the discretion is to be exercised judicially and not arbitrarily.
CONCLUSION.62. The foregoing paragraphs deal with the major points on which we recommend that the law should be amended. The notes on clauses, which are contained in the Appendix, deal with other amendments of a minor character, which we recommend, and which are contained in the draft Bill.63. We should like to repeat the observations with which we concluded our Second Interim Report. There will, no doubt, be some errors and omissions which will be brought to light when the draft Bill has received careful consideration by those concerned, and, in particular, the schedule of repeals will require careful examination. If it is decided to proceed with our proposals these matters can receive attention before the introduction of the Bill, or during the discussion in Parliament.As in the case of the previous Bills, we have throughout pro-ceeded on the footing that our task is not to frame ideal legislation, but to reproduce existing law with such amendment only as is in our opinion likely to command general assent.64. Shortly after the commencement of our work on the present Bill our Secretary, Mr. J. S. Forrest, was replaced by Mr. A. E. Hickinbotham of the Ministry of Health. As before, the drafting of the Bill has involved a very large amount of work in the preparation of notes and memoranda for our use, and Mr. Hickinbotham, like his predecessors, has performed his task admirably and has thereby substantially lightened our labours.We are, Sir, s &apos;Your obedient Servants,Addington, Chairman.

APPENDIX NOTES ON clauses part I.GENERAL PROVISIONS AS TO FOOD AND DRUGS.Clause i. This clause reproduces Section i of the Act oJt 1928, but with substantial drafting alterations. The words &quot; mix, colour, stain, or powder &quot;, which appear in that section but nowhere else in the Food and Drugs, or Public Health, legislation, have been replaced by the simpler and equally comprehensive phrase &quot; add any substance &quot;.Food is denned in Clause 100 as including amongst other things, flavour-ing and colouring matteryAs regards Subsection (3) see Clause 79 and paragraph 10 of the Report.The proviso to Section 1 (3) of the Act of 1928 has been omitted for the reasons stated in paragraph 31 of the Report. Subsection (4) of the same section is reproduced in Clause 7.Clause 2. This clause in part reproduces Section 5 of the Act of 1928. Paragraph (b) is new law. It will be observed that, whereas Section 1 of the Act of 1928 makes it an offence to mix an article of food so as to render the article injurious to health, under Section 5 an offence is com-mitted by abstraction only if the abstraction is made with the intention that the article may be sold in its altered state without notice. The policy of the law in this matter is not entirely clear, but presumably it was thought right to draw a distinction between the act of mixing so as to render the article injurious to health, and the act of abstraction so as to affect injuriously the nature, substance or quality of the article, the former being treated as the more serious matter. The clause does not alter the law on this point, but we have added in paragraph (6) a provision which makes it an offence to abstract, whether with or without notice, if as a consequence the food does not comply with any regulations prescribing the composition of the food. The provision is consequential on the enlarged regulation-making power contained in Clause 8 (1) (c).Section 5 makes it an offence not only to abstract but also to sell any article of food which has been altered by abstraction &quot; without making disclosure of the alteration &quot;. This latter offence is substantially the same as the offence dealt with in Clause 3 of selling to the prejudice of the purchaser food not of the nature, substance or quality demanded, and we have accordingly omitted it from this clause.The words &quot; or direct or permit &quot; which do not appear in Section 5 of the Act of 1928 have been inserted to bring the clause into line with Section 1 of that Act (reproduced in Clause 1) in which the words &quot; order or permit &quot; are used.Section 5 of the Act of 1928, unlike Section 1, is limited to food and contains no reference to drugs. This distinction is maintained in the present clause.Clause 3. This reproduces Section 2 of the Act of 1928, except the proviso to Subsection (2) of that section which appears in an amended form in the next clause.Clause 4. This clause deals with the various defences available in the case of a prosecution for sale to the prejudice of a purchaser of a food or drug which is not of the nature, substance, or quality, demanded.
Paragraph (i) combines the proviso (a) to Section 2 (2), and Section 4 (1) of the Act of 1928. The language is slightly widened so as to cover the case, not only of the added ingredient, but also of the resultant product being &quot; not injurious to health &quot;.Paragraph (2) is new and deals with the case of abstraction from a food or drug. There seems to be no reason why in the matter of these defences a distinction should be drawn between the addition of some substance to, and the abstraction of some constituent from, a food or drug. Cases in which an abstraction could make food injurious to health, or be made for the purpose of fraudulently concealing the inferior quality of a food or drug, are likely to be rare, but we understand that such cases are not impossible.Proviso (a) to the clause takes the place of Section 2(4) of the Act of 1928, and proviso (6) is new. Section 14 of the Finance Act, 1935, makes it an offence to sell spirits delivered in a bottle from a warehouse for home consumption at a strength lower than that by which the duty was computed. This section, being a &quot; revenue &quot; provision, has not been reproduced in the Bill, but is saved by the proviso.Clause 5. Subsection (1) of the clause takes the place of the first part of Section 4 (2) of the Act of 1928. That subsection requires the label to be &quot; distinctly and legibly written or printed &quot; and provides that the label is not to be deemed to be so written or printed &quot; if the notice of mixture given by the label is obscured by other matter on the label &quot;. It is common knowledge that a label may be so printed that information though not actually obscured is unlikely to catch the eye of the customer. The language in Subsection (1) [b) of the clause has been slightly altered with the object of making this type of evasion more difficult. The existing law (Section 4 (1) ) requires the label to bear a notice &quot; to the effect that it [the food or drug] is mixed &quot;. The clause amplifies this by requiring the label to state what substance has been added to, or what constituent abstracted from, the food or drug.Clause 6. Subsection (1) reproduces the latter part of Section 30 (1) of the Act of 1928. That section, however, uses the word &quot;wilfully&quot;, a term to which in the context it is difficult to attach any clear meaning. The clause accordingly omits the word and replaces it by a provision enabling the defendant to plead that he did not know and could not with reasonable diligence have ascertained that the label was of the kind men-tioned in the clause.The words &quot;or is otherwise calculated to mislead &quot; are new and are intended to cover the case, examples of which were brought to our notice, of labels which are plainly of a misleading character though it might be difficult to establish that they contain a description of the food or drug which is false.As regards Subsection (2) see paragraph 41 of the Report. Two provisos to the subsection have been inserted, one similar to the provision in Subsection (1), and the other designed to protect newspaper proprietors and others whose business it is to publish advertisements. The concluding words of the subsection place the onus on the manufacturer, producer or importer of a food or drug to prove that he was not responsible for the publication of the advertisement. We are satisfied that in the absence of this provision the clause would be little more than a dead letter.Clause 7.--This clause reproduces Section 1 (4) of the Act of 1928.Clause 8. In the main this clause is a reproduction of the Public Health (Regulations as to Food) Act, 1907. The following points may be noted:  (1) As regards the term &quot; food intended for sale for human con-sumption &quot; see Clause 100 (2) (b) and paragraph 33 of the Report.
(2) Under the existing law the power to regulate the manner in which receptacles or wrappers are to be labelled or marked only applies specifically to receptacles containing dried, condensed, skimmed or separated milk, but the language of the Public Health (Regulations as to Food) Act, 1907, is wide enough to permit of regulations in relation to food of all kinds so far as it may be necessary on grounds of health. Paragraph (fe) of Subsection (1) extends the specific power to all foods so as to enable an indication of their nature and composition to be required.(3) Paragraph (c) of Subsection (1) is intended to give effect to the recommendations of the Departmental Committee on the Composition and Description of Food discussed in paragraph 40 of our Report. The regulation-making power under this and the preceding paragraph is not limited to measures for the prevention of danger to health but extends to the protection of the purchaser.(4) Subsections (2) and (3) are designed to prevent overlapping with the regulation-making powers in Clauses 18 and 28. Cream is an article which should in most respects be subject to the same control as milk and accordingly Clause 100 (2) defines &quot; milk &quot; as including &quot; cream &quot;. But as regards labelling and the regulation of composition it is more convenient to class it with butter and the other foods to be dealt with by Food Regulations. The subsection accordingly provides in effect that, as regards labelling and composition, regulations as to cream shall be made under this clause, and as regards other matters under Clause 18. Clause 18 (2) prevents regulations under that clause, dealing with cream, overlapping with those under this clause.(5) Penalties for offences under the Public Health (Regulations as to Food) Act, 1907, are governed by Section 1 of the Public Health Act, 1896, now Section 143 of the Act of 1936. Under that section neglect or refusal to carry out the regulations is only an offence if it is wilful. In the case of similar regulations relating to milk under Section 1 of the Milk Act of 1915 (reproduced in Clause 18) a con-viction may be obtained whether the contravention is wilful or not. Similarly, in the case of the offence of selling or offering for sale unsound food under Section 116 of the Act of 1875 (Clause 9) it is not necessary to prove &quot; wilfulness &quot;. It seems to us undesirable to maintain a distinction in this respect between substantially similar offences under the Bill, and accordingly the word &quot; wilful &quot; has been omitted from Clause 92 (2) (e), dealing with offences under the three main sets of regulations (Food Regulations, Milk and Dairies Regulations, and Bread and Flour Regulations) contained in the Bill. Under the terms of that clause, however, it would be possible to draft the regulations so that in suitable cases a contravention of the regulations should be qualified by the necessity of proving &quot; mens rea &quot;. It would also be possible to insert in the regulations a pro-vision on the lines of Clauses 83 and 84 enabling action to be taken against the &quot; actual offender &quot; and the warranty defence to be pleaded in appropriate cases: see paragraphs 30 and 31 of the Report.Clause 9. This clause, together with Clause 10, reproduces the sub-stance of Sections 116 and 117 of the Act of 1875 (as extended by the Act of 1890 and by the common form clause of local acts represented by Standard Clause 92) and Section 180 of the London Act. The form of the two sections has been considerably altered to bring them into line with more modern legislation reproduced in other parts of the Bill. The substantive provision laying down the offence, appears in the first of the two clauses and the necessary machinery of inspection, seizure and condemnation in the second. The first clause makes it.an offence to sell unsound food, whether or not there has been an exposure for sale.   Under
the existing law there is a distinction, at any rate in London, between meat and other articles of food in this respect, a distinction for which there appears to be no good reason: see Section 180 (i) of the London Act and, as regards areas outside London, Bothamley v. Jolly, [1915] 3 K.B. 425.The following points may be noted:  (1) Section 28 of the Act of 1890, which extends the operation of Section 116 of the Act of 1875 to all articles intended for the food of man, is an &quot; adoptive &quot; provision. It is in operation in 920 urban and 389 rural areas and we recommend that it should be made of general application. The clause is drafted accordingly, and sub-stitutes the single word &quot; food &quot; for the list of articles, &quot; animal, carcase, meat, poultry, etc.&quot;, contained in Section 116. The reference in Section 117 to &quot; parcels &quot; of fruit, vegetables, corn, bread or flour has also been omitted. It was presumably inserted in the Act of 1875 in order to avoid the possibility of a separate charge being brought, e.g., in respect of each apple in a parcel. There is no corresponding provision in the Act of 1928 which provides for a number of offences of a similar kind.(2) The various sections reproduced in the Bill contain a number of phrases, such as, &quot; offer for sale &quot;, &quot; expose for sale &quot;, &quot; deposit for the purpose of sale &quot;, &quot; deposit for the purpose of preparation for sale &quot;, &quot; have in his possession for the purpose of sale or of preparation for sale &quot;, &quot; keep for sale &quot;. The Bill substitutes for these expressions the three phrases &quot; offer for sale &quot;, &quot; expose for sale &quot;, &quot; have in his possession for the purpose of sale or of preparation for sale &quot;. Under Clause 81 (4) (a) articles commonly used for human consumption are, if sold or exposed or kept for sale, presumed, until the contrary is proved, to be sold or intended for sale for human consumption.(3) Subsection (2) of the clause reproduces in effect Subsection (3) of Section 180 of the London Act and Subsections (1) and (2) of Standard Clause 92 which provide for a penalty on the &quot; original vendor &quot; of unsound food, but adds two other defences, (a) that the defendant gave notice that the food was not intended for human con-sumption, and (6) that when he dispatched or delivered it, the food was fit for human consumption.(4) The reference to &quot; animals &quot; contained in Sections 116 and 117 of the Act of 1875 has been omitted. We understand that in the case of live animals action is now invariably taken under the Diseases of Animals Acts and not under the Public Health Acts.Clause 10. See note on Clause 9.Under Section 116 of the Act of 1875 the power of seizing unsound food -is conferred only on the medical officer of health and the sanitary inspector. In accordance with the practice adopted in the Act of 1936 the Bill provides that this power may be exercised by any authorised officer of a local authority a phrase defined in Clause 100: see also note on Clause 68.The clause goes further than the existing law in that it extends to food actually sold. This is designed to prevent a tradesman avoiding the con-condemnation of unsound food by placing a &quot; sold &quot; label on the article in question on the approach of an officer.Subsection (2), which requires the officer who seizes an article to in-form the person in whose possession it was found of his intention to have it dealt with by a justice, and entitles any person who might be liable to prosecution to attend before the justice, is taken from Standard Clause 92 (3) and affords the trader an additional protection.As regards Subsection (4) see paragraph 36 of the Report.
Clause ii. This clause is based on Subsections (io) and (ii) of Section 180 of the London Act, and has no counterpart in the law outside London. The definition of &quot; food &quot; in Subsection (ii) is omitted as the word is defined in Clause 100. The drafting has been amended to make it clear who is to be the person to be charged and liable to a penalty where an offence is proved.Clause 12. This clause reproduces in substance Standard Clause 87 which extends Sections 116-118 of the Act of 1875 so as to authorise the examination of vehicles, baskets, etc. if an authorised officer has reason to suspect the presence of any article intended for sale for food or in the course of delivery after sale. The clause as reproduced in the Bill is limited to a power to inspect and remove the food in order to have it dealt with by a justice. Any subsequent prosecution of the responsible person could be instituted under Clause 9.Proviso (61 which prevents the examination of goods with respect to which a customs officer still has duties to perform, has been drawn on the lines of Article 7 (5) of the Public Health (Imported Food) Regula-tions, 1937 (S.R.O. No. 329).Clause 13. This clause reproduces Section 72 of the Act of 1925 which is substantially similar to Section 181 of the London Act. It incorporates also the substance of Standard Clause 85, a provision which extends the obligation under Section 72 to the provision of facilities for washing and applies the section, as far as applicable, to yards: see Subsection (1) (i) and Subsection (5).The following points may be noted: (1) Section 72 (but not the corresponding London provision) excludes rooms to which the Factory and Workshop Act, 1901, or Regulations made under Public Health (Regulations as to Food) Act, 1907, apply. This exception has been omitted. As regards factories the omission follows some of the recent local Acts, and appears necessary in view of the wide definition of the term in the Factory Act, 1937. Regula-tions under the Public Health (Regulations as to Food) Act, 1907, will in future be made under Clauses 8 and 28 of the Bill and care will no doubt be taken to see that they do not overlap with the present clause. Rooms in which only milk, including cream is pre-pared for sale or stored, are specifically excluded from this clause: see Clause 18.(2) Subsection (1) (6) is new in form and represents a compromise * between London and provincial law. Section 181 (1) (c) of the London Act provides that &quot; no drain or pipe for carrying off faecal or sewage matter shall have any inlet or opening within the room, shop or part of a building &quot;. Section 72 (2) (c) of the Act of 1925 requires that there shall be no outlet for the ventilation of a drain and no inlet into any drain unless it is efficiently trapped. We felt that either to apply the London law to the provinces or the provincial law to London would be too drastic. The clause accordingly adopts a middle course and provides for prohibition, but gives a dispensing power to the local authority as regards an inlet into a drain.(3) Subsection (1) (g), corresponding to Subsection (3) (6) of Section 72, has been extended so as to require the cleansing of floors as often as may be necessary.(4) Section 72 of the Act of 1925 does not apply to rooms in which the only food sold or stored is &quot; contained in receptacles so closed as to exclude all risk of contamination &quot;. There is no corresponding pro-vision in Section 181 of the London Act. The exception is reproduced in the proviso to Subsection (1) of the clause with some amplification of the words mentioned above, but it seemed to us that, even in the
case of food contained in these receptacles, it is not unreasonable to impose most of the requirements of the clause, and that the exception should only extend to the requirement of a satisfactory water supply and washing facilities.(5) Subsection (3) follows Section 181 (2) of the London Act which provides that any person who &quot; occupies or lets or knowingly suffers to be occupied &quot; any premises in contravention of the provisions of the section shall be guilty of an offence. It would be wrong, however, to make the owner liable for acts or omissions of the occupier, in matters for which the owner has no responsibility, and the subsection accordingly limits his liability to requirements of the clause which are of structural character, and gives him the protection bf a notice from the local authority.Clause 96 applies Section 289 of the Act of 1936 under which a court may order an occupier to permit an owner to execute any works re-quired by the Act. Subsection (4) of the present clause enables an owner who has let the room without any intention of its being used for the purpose covered by the clause, to recover from the occupier any expense to which he may be put in complying with the local authority&apos;s requirements.Clause 14. Standard Clause 84 empowers a local authority to make byelaws &quot; for promoting and securing sanitary and cleanly conditions in the transport or exposure for sale in the open air of any article intended to be sold for food &quot;. The corresponding section in the London Act (Section 183) uses the words &quot; for promoting sanitary and cleanly con-ditions in the manufacture, preparation, storage, transport or exposure for sale of any article. . . .&quot; We understand that byelaws have been made by the London County Council for three main purposes: (1) the control of rooms; (2) the control of stalls; and (3) to secure the proper wrapping of food sold. The first of these will now be covered by Clause 13, and can, if necessary, be dealt with under Food Regulations. The second, in so far as it relates to the exposure for sale, or sale, of food in the open air, and the third, are appropriate for byelaws under the present clause. Byelaws made in the provinces under the Standard Clause have also, in the main, been limited to securing the proper wrapping of food and the&quot;1 control of stalls. We have accordingly narrowed slightly the scope of the existing byelaw-making powers.Clause 15. This clause is based upon Section 189 of the London Act and Standard Clause 91. The London section applies to any commodity consisting of ice-cream or of any similar substance. Standard Clause 91 applies to any article intended for food. It is common in local Acts to find clauses of this kind limited to ice-cream and similar commodities, and an extension to all articles of food may, particularly in country districts, be too wide. The clause accordingly provides in Subsection (2) that its application to articles other than ice-cream is to be at the discretion of the local authority; the clause does not apply to milk (see Clause 18 (1) (i)). &quot; Ice-cream &quot; is defined in Clause 100 (1) as including any similar commodity.Clause 16. This clause reproduces Section 182 of the London Act and Standard Clause 99, except that the provision in Subsection (5) of the London section for a penalty on failure to send a notice, has been omitted. This does not appear in the Standard Clause and is in our opinion un-necessary. The clause is made to apply to London, and in Subsection (5) a simple procedure of adoption is provided for local authorities outside London.Subsection (4) is necessary, since Section 59 of the Local Government Act, 1933, does not apply to London.
Clause 17. This clause reproduces the substance of Standard Clause 86 (3). As regards the provision for compensation in Subsection (4) see paragraph 36 of the Report.Part II.PROVISIONS AS TO MILK, DAIRIES AND ARTIFICIAL CREAM.Clause 18. (1) The regulation-making powers in Section 1 of the Milk Act of 1915 and Section 8 of the Milk Act of 1922 have been combined in this clause; see also Clause 92. In addition, as has been stated in paragraph 43 of the Report, the powers have been widened to cover several enactments, which are included in the repeal schedule without re-enactment.(2) Amendments have been made on several points of detail.(i) The clause empowers the Minister of Health to make the regula-tions, and in so doing combines and assimilates two different existing order-making powers, namely: (a) Section 1 (4) of the Act of 1915 which enables the Minister of Health to make orders with the concurrence of the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries; and (6) Section 10 (1) of the Milk Act, 1934, which enables the Minister of Health to make orders &quot;after consultation with the Minister of Agri-culture and Fisheries. (The substance of the latter section is contained in Clause 19, but all Milk and Dairies Regulations will in future be made under this clause.) It has been thought better to provide a similar procedure for these similar powers, and provide simply for regulations to be made by the Minister of Health. Reference to consultation between the two Departments has been omitted in accordance with the principle recently stated on behalf of the Govern-ment in the House of Commons on the Livestock Industry Bill (Official Report, 20th January, 1937, columns 201 and 202). Con-sultation in proper cases between the Departments is a matter of inter-departmental arrangement.(ii) In paragraph (a) provision is made for regulations requiring registration of dairymen and dairies. The existing enactment  Section 1 (1) of the Milk Act of 1915 coupled with Section 2 (3) of the Milk Act of 1922 requires registration in separate registers of retail purveyors and other dairymen, and also the registration of all dairies. There appears to be no advantage in insisting on separate registers, and we understand that it is a common practice to keep one register only. The opening words of Section 2 (1) of the Milk Act of 1922 imply that separate registers must be kept, but Clause 20 which replaces this has been redrafted so as to avoid this implication.(iii) In view of the changes in the veterinary service introduced by Section 19 of the Agriculture Act, 1937, Subsections (1) (c) and (2) of Section 1 of the Milk Act of 1915 have not been reproduced. We understand that in future all veterinary inspections necessary for Public Health purposes will be carried out by inspectors of the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries and that sufficient powers of inspection are to be found in other legislation.(iv) The power of authorising local authorities to make regulations, contained in Section 1 (1) (wt) of the Milk Act of 1915, has not been reproduced. It is understood that this power has not been exercised under that Act, although such an order was made under the earlier provision in the Contagious Diseases (Animals) Act, 1878, which Section 1 of the Milk Act of 1915 superseded; that Order remained in force until 1926 when the Milk and Dairies Order, 1926, replaced it, and the regulations which had been made under its authority ceased to have effect.
(v) The effect of the last paragraph of Subsection (i) of the clause and of Clause 100 (2) (6) is to make the present clause applicable not only to milk intended for sale or sold in its natural state, but to milk intended for sale or sold for the manufacture of products for human consumption and to milk intended for manufacture of products for subsequent sale for human consumption: see paragraphs 32 and 33 of the Report.(vi) Subsection (2) is designed to prevent overlapping with Clause 8 as regards cream: see note on that clause.Clause 19. This clause follows generally Section 10 of the Milk Act, 1934. The express provision for consultation by the Minister of Health with the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries before making regulations has been omitted: see note 2 (i) to Clause 18. The provisions making the sale of milk under certain conditions an offence (Subsection (2), repro-ducing Section 3 (2) of the Milk Act of 1922 as re-enacted by Section 10 of the Milk Act, 1934) have been widened by making it an offence to use a designation calculated falsely to suggest in connection with milk sold or for sale that a licence authorising the use of a special designation exists (paragraph (a) of Subsection (2) ).Under Section 10 (1) of the Milk Act of 1922 the enforcing authorities are: (a) Food and Drugs authorities; (6) authorities empowered to direct their officers to take samples; and (c) authorities authorised by the Minister to grant Special Designation licences in effect, the Common Council and Metropolitan borough councils in London, and elsewhere all local authorities including county councils.As mentioned in the note on Clause 65, we have adopted the principle that there should in each case be one, and only one, authority having a duty to enforce. In the present clause the most suitable enforcing authorities are those who are authorised under the regulations to grant the corresponding licences, and the clause accordingly provides in Sub-section (4) that the enforcing authorities shall be county councils and county borough councils, and, in the case of persons who are not producers, county district councils. In London the existing position has been maintained, the enforcing authorities being the Food and Drugs authorities. Clause 65 (3) confers on any county council or local authority the power to institute proceedings, notwithstanding that the duty of enforce-ment does not rest on them.Clause 20. This clause follows in substance Section 2 of the Milk Act of 1922. A new provision (Subsection (5)) has been inserted to secure that an applicant for registration shall, under penalty, inform the local authority whether he is or has been registered in their district or in any other district: see also paragraph 20 of the Report.A time limit of 21 days for an appeal from a decision of a local authority to a court of summary jurisdiction will be found in Clause 87 (2), and provision for further appeal to quarter sessions in Clause 88.As regards Section 2 (3) of the Act of 1922 requiring registration in separate registers of retail purveyors and other dairymen, see note 2 (ii) to Clause 18.Subsection (6) reproduces Section 12 of the Milk Act of 1922, except that the limitation contained in that section to supplies from a &quot; producer &quot; has not been retained. A retailer may be supplied from a wholesaler and there appears to be no reason why this provision should not extend to such cases.Subsection (7) has been added to preserve the existing law: see also paragraph 17 Of the Report.
Clause 21. This is adapted from Section 7 (1) of the Act of 1928, which reproduced a provision in the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1899. Although this section relates to milk, cream, butter, cheese and condensed milk, the only regulations which have been made under it are in relation to the proportions of milk solids in milk, and in skimmed or separated milk, and the proportion of water in butter.It is now considered that regulations prescribing what proportion of certain constituents in a food shall create a presumption (but not con-clusive proof) that a sample is not genuine, are only appropriate to a natural product such as milk, and that manufactured products can better be dealt with by absolute standards. Accordingly the present clause is limited to milk and an absolute standard for the water content of butter is laid down in Clause 30. Absolute standards have already been laid down for condensed milk under the Public Health (Regulations as to Food) Act, 1907, and the Milk Act of 1922, and there will be power to deal with cream and cheese in the same way under Clause 8.The references in the existing enactment to extraneous matter and injury to health have also been omitted as being matters than can better be dealt with by regulations under Clauses 8 or 18.Clause 22. This clause reproduces, with drafting amendments. Section 4 of the Milk Act of 1922, but extends it to mixtures of cream and separated milk. Under that section the enforcing authorities are the Food and Drugs authorities and sampling authorities. Clause 65 (r) imposes the duty of enforcement on the Food and Drugs authorities but the general provision in Subsection (3) of that clause empowering any local authority to take proceedings applies here as in the case of Clause 19.Subsection (1) of the clause reproduces Section 4 (1) of the Milk Act of 1922, but is limited to milk intended for sale or sold for human con-sumption. It seems probable that the words &quot; for human consumption &quot; which occur in similar provisions of the Milk Acts were omitted from Section 4 (1) by inadvertence and we have accordingly inserted them: see also paragraph 32 of the Report.The clause represents new law, in so far as it prohibits the addition of a mixture of cream and separated milk to unseparated milk intended for sale for human consumption, and the sale of such milk, and also the sale of mixtures of cream and separated milk as milk. Such a provision could be made by regulation under the existing law, and we understand that a regulation of this kind has been under consideration.Clause 23. This clause reproduces the substance of Section 5 of the Milk Act of 1915 and Section 5 of the Milk Act of 1922, between which there is a considerable overlap. For the former provision the enforcing authority is the county council or county borough council, with a power for sanitary authorities to take proceedings, and a power for the Minister by order to transfer the duty from the county council to the council of a non-county borough in certain circumstances. It is understood that no such orders have been made. Under Section 5 of the Milk Act of 1922 the enforcing authority is the sanitary authority. The clause gives the duty of enforcement to county councils and county borough councils, and sanitary authorities have a power to take proceedings under Clause 65 (3).As regards the limitation to sale for human consumption see the note on Clause 22, where a similar limitation has been inserted; it may be noted that Section 5 of the Milk Act of 1915 contains the words, whereas Section 5 of the Milk Act of 1922 does not.Clause 24. The power conferred by this clause is taken from Section 12 of the Milk Act of 1915, a section which applies to the sanitary authority of any district.    Since the date of that Act the Maternity and Child
Welfare Act, 1918, (now repealed and reproduced in Part VII of the Act of 1936 and Part XII&apos; of the London Act) conferred on the authorities, including county councils which administer the Act, wide powers of making arrangements for the care of expectant and nursing mothers, and children of pre-school age, and these powers cover the supply of milk in proper cases whether at cost price, or at less than cost price or free of charge. Outside county boroughs these powers are exercisable either by the county council or by the county district council, whichever is the &quot; welfare authority &quot; for the area. We understand that the somewhat narrower powers of the Milk Act of 1915 have not, in fact, been used and that supplies of milk for mothers and infants have always been provided under the maternity and child welfare powers. Wc have thought it right, however, to reproduce the earlier section but to insert words limiting the clause to local authorities who are not &quot; welfare authorities &quot; so as to avoid an overlap between the two codes.The express provision contained in Subsection (2) of Section 12 of the Milk Act of 1915 that the Minister may attach such conditions to his approval as he may deem necessary, has been omitted as being implied.Clause 25. This clause reproduces Section 1 of the Artificial Cream Act, 1929. As regards penalties for offences under the clause, see para-graph 10 of the Report. As to the enforcement of provisions relating to artificial cream, see Clause 65 (1).Clause 26. Subsection (1) reproduces Section 2 (1) of the Artificial Cream Act, 1929. Subsection (2) of the clause which reproduces Section 2 (5) of that Act, has been shortened by the omission of references to obstruction and the furnishing of information, which are dealt with in Clause 78. Subsections (3) and (4) of Section 2 of the Artificial Cream Act, 1929, are dealt with in Clause 77 (Power to enter premises).A provision has been inserted in Subsection (2) of the clause empowering a court to order the forfeiture of a machine for the manufacture of artificial cream, if it is found on unregistered premises which are being used in con-contravention of the clause. This provision is not in the Artificial Cream Act, 1929, but it appears to follow from the power in Section 2 (4) of that Act for an authorised officer to search for and seize such a machine.Clause 27. This clause reproduces Section 3 of the Artificial Cream Act, 1929, but the words &quot; unless, in the case of regulations, the regulations otherwise provide &quot; have been inserted, since it might well be desirable to insert provisions in Milk and Dairies Regulations which would be inappropriate-priate to artificial cream.Part III.PROVISIONS AS TO OTHER KINDS OF FOOD. Clause! 28. See paragraph 49 of the Report and Clause 92. Clause 29. See paragraph 51 of the Report.Clause 30. Section n of the Act of 1928 imposes a limit on the percent-age of water which butter, margarine and milk-blended butter may contain. In the case of milk-blended butter, the limit applies generally; in the case of the other two substances, it applies only where the butter or margarine is in, or consigned from, a butter or margarine factory. It is a defence in the latter case for the occupier of the factory to prove that the butter or margarine was not made, blended, reworked, or treated, in the factory.The clause applies to butter and margarine as well as to milk-blended butter, in all cases where the article is intended for sale, and omits the reference to factories: see note on Clause 21.The reference in paragraph (b) of the clause to the fat content of margarine reproduces Section 6 (2) of the Act of 1928.
Clause 31. Subsections (1) to (6) of the clause reproduce with slight verbal alterations Section 6 of the Act of 1928. Subsection (2) of Section 6 has been omitted, being replaced by paragraph (6) of the preceding -ing clause. The expression &quot; in block letters &quot; has been used throughout in place of the two existing phrases &quot; in printed capital letters &quot; and &quot; in capital block letters &quot;. In Subsection (6) the word &quot; resembling &quot; has been used in place of &quot; purporting to be &quot;.Subsection (7) reproduces the provision in Section 23 of the Act of 1928.Clause 32. This clause reproduces the substance of Section 8 of the Act of 1928, but the provision enabling the Minister of Health to direct the manner of registration has been omitted as unnecessary. There is no corresponding provision in any other similar registration clause of the Bill.Subsection (5) of the clause reproduces Article IV of the Registration of Manufactories of Margarine and Margarine-cheese Order, 1900, and Article III of the Registration of Butter Factories and Dealers in Milk Blended Butter Order, 1907: see also paragraph 16 of the Report.Subsection (6) extends the obligation to notify the registration of premises, to notification of changes of occupation and of the deletion of premises from the register. Changes of occupation will be known to the authority by virtue of Subsection (5) of the clause.Clause 33.-This clause reproduces Section 9 of the Act of 1928. Para-graphs (a) to (e) in Subsection (2) of the section have been slightly re-arranged and shortened. The reference to the offence of failing to keep a register has been omitted as it is covered by the offence of failing to keep a register posted up to date.Clause 34. This clause reproduces Section 10 of the Act of 1928 without material alteration.Clause 35. This clause substantially reproduces Section 187 of the London Act and Standard Clause 94. Clauses based on the Standard Clause have freely been allowed by Parliament for many years and are in operation in many districts, including some rural districts. The clause is to be regarded as regards the premises to which it applies as supple-mentary to Clause 13 which applies generally.Subsections (8) and (9) of the clause are designed to prevent overlapping with provisions in local Acts. They follow a similar provision in Section 269 (9) of the Public Health Act, 1936.Subsection (10) of the London section, which provides that any fine recovered in proceedings under the section by a sanitary authority is to go to the authority, has been omitted in accordance with modern practice.Clause 36. Subsection (1) of this clause is taken substantially from paragraph (3) of Section 188 of the London Act and Subsection (1) of Standard Clause 95.Subsections (2) and (3) empower a medical officer of health to order that ice-cream which he suspects of being likely to cause any milk-borne disease (i.e., any of the diseases named in Part II of the First Schedule to the Bill) shall not be removed except as he may specify. If on further investigation his suspicions are confirmed, he must cause it to be destroyed; otherwise he must withdraw his order. We are satisfied that machinery of this nature is more appropriate to this class of case than seizure and removal to a justice.As regards the compensation provisions in Subsection (4), see para-graph 37 of the Report.
part iv.PROVISIONS AS TO IMPORTATION OF CERTAIN PRODUCE.Clause 40. This clause reproduces Section 12 of the Act of 1928. Paragraph (c) is drawn in more general terms than the corresponding paragraph in that Act. The existing regulations (Public Health (Condensed Milk) Regulations, 1923, S.R.O. No. 509 and amending regu-lations of 1927, S.R.O. No. 1092) deal with the composition and labelling of condensed milk.The last three lines of paragraph (A) are taken from Section 23 of the Act of 1928.As regards the reference to the &quot; United Kingdom &quot; and the use of square brackets, see paragraph 53 of the Report.Clause 41. This clause reproduces Section 20 of the Act of 1928.Subsection (3) provides that a copy of the certificate of analysis shall be sent to the importer where it appears that an offence has been committed. This combines Subsection (3) of Section 20 which requires the Commissioners of Customs and Excise to notify an importer where the analysis shows a sample to be margarine or milk-blended butter, and Section 28 (1) of the same Act, which applies generally to prosecutions thereunder, and requires that a copy of the certificate of analysis shall be sent with the summons. This latter provision is repeated as regards the rest of the Bill in Clause 80 (3): see also paragraph 53 of the Report.Clause 37. The requirement in Section 1 of the Sale of Horseflesh, etc.. Regulation Act, 1889, that the letters of the notice should be not less than four inches in length has been omitted. There is no corresponding provision in the section relating to slaughter-houses and knackers&apos; yards (Section 170 of the Act of 1875) and it seems preferable to rely on the requirement that the words must be affixed in a conspicuous position and the letters legible.Sections 3 to 5 of the Sale of Horseflesh, etc.. Regulation Act, 1889, and the corresponding provisions of the London Act, dealing with the seizure and condemnation of horseflesh, are repealed without re-enactment. Horse-flesh sold irregularly is not a public danger like unsound food, and all that is necessary is to secure by adequate penalties that the requirements of Section r of the Act of 1889 are complied with. If the horseflesh is unfit for human consumption it can be dealt with under Clauses 9 and 10.Clause 38. Article 13 of the Public Health (Meat) Regulations, 1924 (S.R. O. No. 1432), prohibits the inflation of carcases with the breath or in any other manner likely to cause infection or contamination.The clause, reproducing Standard Clause 98, contains a similar pro-hibition but without the qualifying words, the object of the extension being to prevent fraud on the purchaser. It is limited to carcases intended for sale for human consumption; the Standard Clause is not so limited.Clause 39. This clause reproduces the Public Health (Cleansing of Shellfish) Act, 1932, but, except in the case of London omits reference to borrowing, since the necessary borrowing powers are now to be found in Section 195 of the Local Government Act, 1933.The reference to a joint committee is necessary to enable a council to contribute to a joint committee on which the contributing council is not represented. Section 93 of the Local Government Act, 1933, only applies to contributions by constituent authorities.
Clause 42. This clause is based on the corresponding provision of the Act of 1928. Subsection (4) contains a new provision similar to those contained in Clauses 3 (2) and 7 (Sections 2 (4) and 1 (4) of the Act of 1928).   The following minor amendments have been made: (a) the term &quot; customs penalty &quot; has been substituted for &quot; fine &quot;. The proviso to Subsection (3) (corresponding to that to Section 27 (3) of the Act of 1928) which provides an alternative penalty for offences in relation to importation of butter etc. has been widened to extend to all offences under Part IV of the Bill. The existing limitation seems to be merely a result of the consolidation in the Act of 1928 of Acts with different histories.(6) the obligation on the defendant to make a deposit covering the cost of calling the Government Chemist as a witness has been omitted and payment of costs is left to the discretion of the court.(c) Subsection (6) empowers the court to direct that the part of the sample produced at the hearing shall be sent to &quot; some independent person &quot; for analysis. Under the existing law (Section 31 of the Act of 1928) the analysis in such circumstances is made by the Government Chemist. The object of dividing the sample into three parts is to enable an independent report to be obtained, and, since in importation cases the prosecution is based on the report of the Government Chemist to whom the second part of the sample is sent (Clause 41 (2) ), it seems logical to provide that the part produced in court may be sent to some independent expert.Clause 43. See paragraph 53 of the Report.part v.MARKETS, SLAUGHTER-HOUSES AND COLD-AIR STORES.Clause 44. The provisions of Section 166 of the Act of 1875 which, in the case of a borough council, require the consent of two-thirds of the number of the council to a resolution establishing a market, and in the case of any other urban authority the consent of owners and ratepayers at a meeting or by way of poll, have been omitted.Subsection (2) of the clause reproduces the concluding words of Section 166, but the proviso is new. Our attention was called to the fact that the Ministry of Health had been advised that the prohibition against inter-ference &quot; with any rights powers or privileges enjoyed within the district by any person &quot; would make it impossible for a local authority to establish a market under the section if some neighbouring authority had already done so, and the two sites were within 7 miles of each other. It seems clear that the framers of the Act of 1875 cannot have intended so anomalous a result, and accordingly the proviso has been inserted to secure that the proximity of an existing Public Health Act market is not to prove an obstacle to the establishment of a new one by another authority. The proviso applies only to a market established under statu-tory powers. It leaves unaffected the rights of a local authority who own a &quot; franchise &quot; market.Clause 45. This clause reproduces by reference to the Companies Act, 1929, the substance of Section 168 of the Act of 1875. The power for a local authority to purchase a market is contained in Clause 44 (1) (ii).Clause 46. Section 14 of the Markets and Fairs Clauses Act, 1847, replaced by this clause requires the market undertakers to hold markets on the days prescribed by the special Act and on other days as they may appoint by byelaw. Section 42 of the same Act enables an authority to fix market days and hours by byelaw. A power to appoint market days and hours with the consent of the Minister has been substituted for the two provisions.
Clause 47. -Sections 166 and 167 of the Act of 1875, and the incor-porated sections of the Markets and Fairs Clauses Act, 1847, refer to &quot; stallages, rents and tolls.&quot; This phrase would not include miscellaneous charges, e.g. for weighing, and the words stallages, tolls and charges have accordingly been used.It should be noted that Section 167 only requires the Ministers consent to tolls, but there seems no reason for this limitation and the clause accordingly extends this requirement to all stallages, tolls and charges. We understand that this is the usual practice in Provisional Orders revising scales of charges in markets.Clause 48. In this clause and Clauses 49, 54 and 56, the phrase &quot; authorised market officer &quot; is used. This is defined in Clause 100 as meaning an officer specially authorised by a market authority to collect tolls, stallages and other charges.Clause 49. This clause reproduces the substance of Section 38 of the Markets and Fairs Clauses Act, 1847. The provision for recovery by summary proceedings is new.Clause 50. The replies to the inquiries which we have made (see para-graph 54 of the Report) indicate that prosecutions under Section 13 of the Markets and Fairs Clauses Act, 1847, reproduced in this clause are infrequent but we have thought it advisable none the less to retain the provision.The clause, following the Act of 1847, refers to &quot; articles in respect of which tolls are .... for the time being chargeable.&quot; We understand from the inquiries referred to above that except in cattle markets tolls are now seldom charged in respect of specific articles, the usual system being to charge stallages. We considered whether a reference to stallages should be added, but reached the conclusion that this would unduly widen the clause since the prohibition would then cover practically all articles sold in a market.The clause as drafted extends over the whole district of the local authority. The Act of 1847 refers to &quot; the limits of the special Act,&quot; and we understand the accepted view to be that in relation to Public Health Act markets this phrase means the district of the local authority, n We considered whether, more particularly in the case of a rural district, so extensive a prohibition might not be unnecessarily onerous, but the difficul-ties of defining the area in narrower terms are considerable, and as already stated the evidence goes to show that the existing provision so far from operating oppressively, is seldom used at all.The clause limits the prohibition to market days and hours. This limitation does not appear in the original section, but as the object of the section appears to be to prevent unfair competition with traders in the market, it seems reasonable to limit the prohibition in this way.The reference to certificated pedlars preserves the position of pedlars under Section 6 of the Pedlars Act, 1871.Clause 51. Subsection (1) of this clause reproduces the substance of Sections 21 and 24 of the Markets and Fairs Clauses Act, 1847. Sub-section (2) is necessary to preserve the position under the Weights and Measures Act, 1878, Part II of the Sixth Schedule to which, it is proposedto repeal as regards market authorities: see Part I of the Third Scheduleto the Bill.Clause 52. This clause reproduces the substance of Section 22 of the Markets and Fairs Clauses Act, 1847.Clause 53. Subsection (1) of this clause reproduces with some amend-ment Section 25 of the Markets and Fairs Clauses Act, 1847.
The reference to &quot; cart &quot; has been widened to cover any vehicle, and the responsible person is to be &quot; the person in charge &quot; and not the &quot; driver &quot; who may simply be present in that role and have no interest in the transaction.The clause, following Section 25, refers to vehicles (carts) in which articles are brought for sale in the market. We have therefore omitted as unnecessary the reference to the preliminary weighing &quot; without the loading.&quot;The inquiries referred to in paragraph 54 of the Report made it appear that weighing machines are generally in or near to the markets and that no payments are now made for taking a &quot; cart &quot; thereto. We have therefore omitted any reference to such payments. Subsection (2) repro-duces Section 26 of the Markets and Fairs Clauses Act, 1847. As stated in paragraph 10 of the Report assimilation of penalties has been effected wherever possible and the penalty has therefore been increased from 20s. to 40s. the penalty provided for a similar offence by Clause 52.Clause 54. It was represented to us that the bringing of animals, par-ticularly sheep, into markets in large double decked vehicles has pre-sented a new problem in the collection of tolls. It is impossible to count the animals until they are unloaded and this cannot be done if tolls are collected at the gates of a market. This clause accordingly provides that information shall be given to officers authorised to collect tolls, and Clause 56 (6) provides, as for other frauds, a penalty if false information is given with intent to evade payment.Clause 55. This clause combines and reproduces the substance of Section 23 and the first sub-paragraph of Section 29 of the Markets and Fairs Clauses Act, 1847.Clause 56. This clause reproduces in considerably shortened form the substance of Sections 27-30 of the Markets and Fairs Clauses Act, 1847. The maximum penalty of  5 in these sections has been raised because all these offences involve fraud for which a fine of  5 or indeed any pecuniary penalty may be insufficient: see also paragraph 13 of the Report.Paragraph (b) provides a penalty where false information is given under Clause 54.Clause 57. This clause reproduces the byelaw-making power given by Section 167 of the Act of 1875 and paragraphs (1) and (4) of Section 42 of the Markets and Fairs Clauses Act, 1847. As regards the powers in the remaining paragraphs of the last mentioned section:  paragraph (2) see note on Clause 46;paragraph (3) this is not incorporated by Section 167 as it is not a provision relating to markets;paragraph (5) no power seems necessary as regards regulation of use of weighing machines; Clause 56 deals with frauds in connection with weighing;paragraph (6) Clauses 9, 10, and 12 deal adequately with the sale of unsound food.It will be observed that the clause extends to local authorities who carry on a market other than a statutory market under the Public Health Acts. We understand that a number of byelaws have in the past been made and confirmed under the powers of Section 167 of the Act of 1875 in respect of charter markets and the language of the section appears wide enough to permit of this.Clause 58. See paragraphs 54 to 60 of the Report. As regards Sub-section (3), see paragraph 20 of the Report.
Clause 59. This clause reproduces the byelaw-making powers con-ferred by Section .128 of the Towns Improvement Clauses Act, 1847, except that the references to byelaws &quot; for the licensing, registering and inspection &quot; of slaughter-houses and knackers&apos; yards and &quot; for removing filth at least once in every 24 hours and requiring them [slaughter-houses and knackers&apos; yards] to be provided with a sufficient supply of water &quot; have been omitted as being covered, in the first case by the general powers of the Bill, and, secondly, by the more general terms of the byelaw-making power.The question of the relation between the power of making byelaws for preventing cruelty and Section 1 of the Slaughter of Animals Act, 1933, called for some consideration. That section, which applies to animals other than sheep but may be applied to the latter by resolution of a local authority, provides, in effect, that the animal must be instantaneously slaughtered or stunned by a mechanically operated instrument. In the case of pigs, however, an exception is made to this where a supply of electrical energy is not, and cannot reasonably be made, available. We understand that before the passing of this Act it was common for local authorities to make a byelaw based on a model issued by the Ministry of Health which required that the animals should be stunned or slaughtered by a mechanically operated instrument without the limitation as regards an available supply of electrical energy which is to be found in Section 1 of the Act. It appears that in some cases similar byelaws have been made and confirmed since the passing of the Act. Our attention was drawn to this point and to the difficult question whether the effect of the Act is to limit the earlier byelaw-making power.We felt clear that in a matter of this kind, which not only is the subject of very recent legislation but may well excite some controversy, the proper course in the present Bill would be to reproduce the existing law without amendment. On our invitation the Ministry of Health were good enough to take the highest legal advice, and we understand that the advice received is that a byelaw on this matter, which goes beyond the terms of the Act of 1933, is invalid. We have accordingly, in reproducing the byelaw-making power for the prevention of cruelty, inserted words providing that byelaws shall not be made with respect to any matter for which provision is made by the Slaughter of Animals Act, 1933 (proviso to Subsection (1)). In the absence of such words it is at least arguable that to reproduce the language of the Act of 1847 in any statute passed after the Slaughter of Animals Act, 1933, would, in fact, change the law, since the interpretation to be placed on the words might well be affected by a consideration of the dates of the relevant Acts.Clause 60. This clause reproduces Section 170 of the Act of 1875, except that: (a) The reference to &quot; owner &quot; has been omitted, since Clause 58 puts the obligation of obtaining a licence on the occupier only: see paragraph 22 of the Report.(6) Reference to &quot; registered slaughter-house &quot; has been omitted as the Bill provides that in future all slaughter-houses and knackers&apos; yards shall be licensed.(c) The penalty has been reduced from ^5 to 40s. and the provision for a continuing penalty omitted.Clause 61. The existing power in Section 169 of the Act of 1875 is to provide &quot; slaughter-houses &quot; which, by virtue of the definition in Section 4 of that Act, includes knackers&apos; yards. We understand that the power to provide knackers&apos; yards has never been exercised and is not likely to be required. We are proposing in Clause 100 separate definitions of slaughter-houses and knackers&apos; yards and we have thought it sufficient that the local authority&apos;s power to provide should be restricted to slaughter-houses.
part vi.GENERAL AND MISCELLANEOUS.Clause 64. See paragraphs 23 to 27 of the Report.Clause 65. We have adopted the principle of imposing the duty of enforcing the various provisions of the Bill in any specified circumstances on one authority and one authority alone. The authority is always either the county council or the local authority and in a considerable number of cases it is the Food and Drugs authority as defined in the last clause, i.e., the county council for some part of the county (except London) and the local authority for other parts. Subsection (3) at the same time confers a -power to take proceedings under the Bill on the council, whether the county council or the local authority, upon whom the duty of enforcing the particular provision is not imposed. It is also to be remembered that, though the Food and Drugs authority are the authority to enforce such of the provisions of the Bill as are taken from the Act of 1928, any &quot; authorised officer &quot; of a local authority is a sampling officer and as such may take samples and have them examined: see Clause 68.The clauses mentioned in paragraphs (a) to (d) of Subsection (1) cor-respond with the provisions of the Act of 1928 and the other enactments which, under the existing law, are enforceable by Food and Drugs authorities.So far as regards regulations under the Bill, the authority whose duty it is to enforce them will be prescribed by the regulations themselves: see Clause 92 (3). This accords with the existing law, see the Public Health (Regulations as to Food) Act, 1907 when read with Section 143 (3) of the Act of 1936 and Section 18 (5) of the Milk Act of 1915.Section 169 of the Act of 1875 enables an urban authority to provide &quot; slaughter-houses, and, unlike Section 166 which deals with markets, does not contain the limiting words &quot; within their district.&quot; The question of the right of a local authority to establish a hospital or execute other works outside their district is discussed in the note on Clause 271 of the Public Health Bill in our Second Interim Report. It may clearly be convenient that a slaughter-house should in some cases be outside the district of the local authority, but, if so, we consider that the authority in whose area it is to be provided should have an opportunity of ex-pressing their views. The clause gives effect to this and empowers the Minister to decide if the two authorities fail to agree.Clause 62. See paragraph 61 of the Report.Clause 63. We understand that the powers of this clause, which repro-duces Section 71 of the Act of 1925, nave not been widely used. Sub-section (1) of the clause introduces the same distinction between the establishment of a cold-air store inside and outside the district as is intro-duced in Clause 61 in the case of slaughter-houses: see note on that clause.Subsection (4) of the original section, which requires a local authority to give notice of the Ministers intention to hold a local Inquiry, has been omitted as unnecessary. We understand that the Department invariably require proper notice of a local Inquiry to be given. Moreover, if the requirement were inserted here, it would have the appearance of dis-pensing with the necessity of notice in the case of local Inquiries under other provisions of the Bill, and indeed under other enactments.
Clause 66. This clause reproduces Section 15 of the Act of 1928 with a number of minor alterations:  (1) The express power to remove a public analyst has been omitted as unnecessary, since it is implied in Subsection (3).(2) The words in Subsection (2) &quot; unless he possesses either the prescribed qualifications or such other qualifications as the Minister may approve &quot; have been substituted for the words &quot; possessing com-petent knowledge, skill and experience,&quot; and for the requirement that the analyst &quot; shall furnish such proof of competency as may from time to time be required by regulation framed by the Minister of Health.&quot; We understand that the Department have found some diffi-culty in framing regulations dealing with proof of competency. The Minister of Health prescribes the qualifications of a medical officer of health under Section 103 of the Local Government Act, 1933, and the proper course appears to be to assimilate the law in this respect, but to maintain a certain latitude which will allow of the appointment in proper cases of a person who does not possess the prescribed qualifications.The last three lines of Subsection (4) are new but give effect to the existing practice.The requirement in Subsection (5) that the regulations should be laid before Parliament is new: see paragraph 28 of the Report and Clause 96 incorporating Section 319 of the Act of 1936.Clause 67. Section 10 of the Milk Act of 1915, reproduced in this clause, makes the provision of facilities for bacteriological or other examination of milk obligatory on a local authority if the Minister of Health so requires. We understand that it has not been necessary for the Department to put pressure on local authorities in this matter and the clause is drafted as a power. The clause is widened to cover all food and drugs. This seemed to us advisable, for Clause 69 removes the obligation to submit samples to the public analyst in every case in which a prosecution is contemplated, and no doubt greater use will be made of other forms of examination.Clause 68. Under the existing law the officers authorised to act as sampling officers for all foods and drugs are &quot; any medical officer of health, sanitary inspector, inspector of weights and measures, inspector of a market or police officer acting under the direction and at the cost of the local authority appointing him.&quot; But under the Milk Act of 1915 any person authorised by a local authority or by a medical officer of health may take samples of milk. (For these purposes &quot; local authority &quot; includes a county council.) The definition of &quot; authorised officer &quot; in Clause 100 of the Bill empowers a council to authorise any of their officers either generally or specially to act in any specified matter and enables the medical officer of health and sanitary inspector of the council to act without special authority. A police officer may be authorised with the approval of the police authority.As regards the words &quot; for analysis or for bacteriological or other examination &quot; in Subsection (1) see the first paragraph of the note on Clause 69.Paragraph (6) of Subsection (3) of the clause is new, but when read with Clause 13, and the power of entry under Clause 77, gives effect to a provision to be found in Standard Clause 86.As regards Subsection (6) of the clause, it has been represented to us that the existing procedure, under which a sampling officer may exercise his sampling powers outside the area of his authority only if and so far as the Minister may so direct (Section 8 (1) of the Milk Act of 1915), is cumbersome.   The present subsection accordingly provides that samples
may be taken outside the district with the consent of the authority con-cerned and empowers the&apos; Minister to determine whether consent has been unreasonably withheld.Subsection (8) of the clause in reproducing Section 16 (4) of the Act of 1928 omits the words &quot; except an inspector of a market and in London an inspector of weights and measures,&quot; since under the new definition these officers are not sampling officers unless so authorised for the purpose by the local authority. The reference in the same subsection to officers of Customs and Excise has been omitted, as.we understand that the power is never exercised or required. Clause 41 of the Bill confers ample powers on these officers for the sampling of imported food.Section 8 (1) of the Milk Act of 1915 confers sampling powers both &quot;on inspectors of the Ministry of Health and on persons appointed for the purpose by such inspectors. We understand that this power of appoint-ment has never been exercised, and it has accordingly been omitted.Clause 69. This clause gives a discretion to a sampling officer to have a sample analysed. Section 17 of the Act of 1928 provides that a sampling officer shall, submit a sample for analysis if he suspects a contravention of the Act, but Section 8 of the Milk Act of 1915 merely provides that samples may be taken &quot; for examination.&quot; The Depart-mental Committee on the Composition and Description of Food (see para-graph 40 of our Report) suggested in paragraph 40 of their Report (Cmd. 4564) that the requirement in the Act of 1928 should be removed and that it should &quot; not be essential to submit to chemical analysis an article of food, the nature or composition of which may be sufficiently proved in some other way.&quot; Subsection (1) of the clause accordingly so provides, but the position of the public analyst is safeguarded by the requirement that where an officer considers analysis is necessary, he shall submit the sample to the public analyst.The concluding words of Subsection (1) &quot;or is deemed to have been procured &quot; refe; to Subsections (5) and (6) of Clause 68.Following the principle adopted in the Local Government Act, 1933, and the Public Health Act, 1936, we have provided in Subsection (3) for a prescribed form of the result of an analysis, instead of a statutory form.   This is defined in Clause 100 as meaning prescribed by the Minister.The second paragraph of Subsection (3) of the clause, which requires the analyst to have regard to regulations made under Clause 21, is founded on the concluding words of Section 7 (1) of the Act of 1928.Clause 70. Section 18 (1) of the Act of 1928 is limited to the case of a purchase of a sample. Subsection (1) of the clause extends to the taking of a sample without purchase and requires the notice in such a case to be sent to the occupier of the premises on which the sample is taken, or the person in charge thereof.Section 18 (3) of the Act of 1928 (which provides for the sending by registered post the part of the sample submitted for analysis, if the analyst resides more than two miles away, and makes the cost of postage part of the charges of prosecution) has been omitted.Clause 71. This clause and the Second Schedule reproduce the substance of the special provisions relating to samples of milk in the Act of 1928 and the Milk Acts of 1915 and rg22, in so far as they are not covered by Clause 68.Subsection (1) and the Second Schedule reproduce Section 21 (1) and the Second Schedule to the Act of 1928, and Subsection (3), Section 21 (2) of that Act. Subsection (2), reproducing Section 9 (3) of the Milk Act of 1922, contains also the substance of the proviso to Section 8 (2) of the Milk Act of 1915.
Section 21 (3) of the Act of 1928, defining a &quot; purveyor of milk &quot; is reproduced in Clause 100 (1).Clause 72. This clause reproduces the substance of Section 19 of the Act of 1928. The power to procure samples is not limited to those which it is intended to submit for analysis. This is in accordance with the principle adopted in Clause 68: see note on that clause.Clause 73. Subsections (1) and (3) of Section 22 of the Act of 1928, so far as they relate to the Minister of Agriculture and, Fisheries, are reproduced in this clause. Subsection (2) of that section, which enables an officer of a Food and Drugs authority if specially authorised by them to enter and inspect a registered butter factory, has been omitted as unnecessary. The inspection of butter factories by Food and Drugs authorities seems to be on exactly the same footing as the inspection of artificial cream factories or, indeed, of any factories in which food is prepared, and which a local authority must enter and inspect, in order to enforce the provisions of Clause 13. The power of entry is given by Clause 77, which applies generally to the Bill.As regards the requirement in Subsection (4) of Section 22 of the Act of 1928 that the authority of an officer shall be produced if required, this is provided, in the case of officers of the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries in Subsection (1) of the clause, and, in the case of officers of a Food and Drugs authority in Subsection (1) of Clause 77.Clause 74. The obligation under the existing law to &quot; report quarterly &quot; has been made more specific by the insertion of quarterly dates conform-ing with the existing practice, and the words &quot; and the report shall be presented at the next meeting of the authority &quot; contained in Section 25 of the Act of 1928 have been omitted as unnecessary. The requirement that the analysfs report is to include the sum paid to him for each analysis has also been omitted.In Subsection (2) the word &quot; annually &quot; in relation to the transmission to the Minister of copies of the reports has been omitted. This enables the Minister to secure each quarterly report shortly after the ^end of the quarter.   We understand this to be the usual practice at present.Clause 75. Subsection (3) is limited to expenses incurred by a county council as a Food and Drugs authority. Expenses incurred by a county council under the Bill in any other capacity are expenses for general county purposes by virtue of Section 180 of the Local Government Act, 1933.Subsection (5) is new: see paragraph 27 of the Report.Clause 76. This clause empowers the Minister by order to assign to port health authorities functions, rights and liabilities of local authorities or Food and Drugs authorities, under the Bill; to constitute a united district for the carrying out of functions under the Bill; and to empower county and county borough councils to discharge their functions through a joint board. As regards the provinces, this follows the practice adopted in the Act of 1936, and the procedure thereunder will apply.As regards London, the Minister can by an order under Section 6 of the London Act assign to the port health authority functions under certain sections of that Act incorporated in the Bill, and Subsection (2) of this clause similarly provides for duties of a local authority or Food and Drugs authority, under the Bill, and also as regards the byelaw-making power in Clause 14.Clause 77. This clause substantially follows the lines of Section 287 of the Act of 1936. Paragraphs (b) and (c) of Subsection (1) of that section have been omitted, as the present Bill does not provide for the
execution of works. In Subsection (4) a limitation of one month to the validity of a warrant has been inserted for a similar reason. Entry will only be required for inspection and sampling and there is no case for an indefinite period of operation for a warrant giving a right of entry. The words relating to seizure of artificial cream machines, in Subsection (2) of the clause, are taken from Section 2 of the Artificial Cream Act, 1929. As regards the seizure of machines, see note on Clause 26 (2).Clause 78. The Acts reproduced in the Bill contain a number of clauses dealing with obstruction and provide for penalties of varying degrees of severity.   Thus (1) Under Section 1 (3) of the Public Health Act, 1896, which applies to regulations under the Public Health (Regulations as to Food) Act, 1907, a person wilfully neglecting, or refusing to obey, or obstructing the execution of, regulations, is liable to a maximum penalty of  100 and a continuing penalty of /50 per day.(2) Under Section 2 of the Milk Act of 1915, a person refusing admission to an officer who requires admission for the purposes of enforcing a Milk and Dairies Order is liable to the same penalties as under Section 102 of the Act of 1875 (now s. 288 of the Act of 1936), i.e., a maximum penalty of ^5.(3) Under Section 16 of the Act of 1928, a person refusing to allow a sampling officer to purchase or take a sample is liable to a maximum penalty of  10.(4) Under Section 24 of the Act of 1928, a person obstructing an inspector or other officer is guilty of an offence under the Act, and is liable to a maximum penalty of /20 for the first offence, of ^50 for the second, and of  100, or a term of three months&apos; imprisonment, for subsequent offences.(5) Under Section 180 (6) of the London Act, a person who is guilty of obstruction with intent to prevent the discovery of an offence of selling, etc., unsound food, or who has been convicted of such an offence within the previous 12 months is liable to one month&apos;s imprisonment in lieu of a fine.It will be observed that the penalties for obstruction in some of these Acts are severe in comparison with the maximum fine of  5 provided in the Act of 1875. The reason for this is no doubt that in connection with many of the offences with which the Bill deals, successful obstruction on the part of the trader may enable him to escape prosecution for a substantive offence carrying with it liability to a heavy fine. For this reason it is clear that a maximum penalty of  5 for obstruction such as appears in Section 288 of the Act of 1936 may in some cases be quite insufficient. We have accordingly distinguished in the clause between obstruction of the ordinary kind and obstruction in a case where the court is satisfied that it was aimed at preventing the discovery of some other offence under the Bill. In the latter case and also in the case where the defendant has been convicted of obstruction under the clause within the previous 12 months the clause, following Section 180 (6) of the London Act, provides for a maximum term of one month&apos;s imprison-ment in lieu of a fine.Subsection (3) of the clause, which requires a person to give information and reasonable assistance to any officer acting in the execution of the Act, is taken from Section 14 of the Milk Act of 1915. The proviso, which relieves a person of the obligation to give information which might incriminate him, is new.Clause 79. See paragraph 10 of the Report.
Clause 80. Proviso (a) to Subsection (1) reproduces the proviso to Section 27 (1) of the Act of 1928, but extends it to samples which have been taken and not purchased. There seems to be no reason why the limitation of time to take proceedings should not apply equally in this case.Proviso (b) is new. It was represented to us that articles in respect of which warranties are given are frequently kept in stock in retail shops and sold long after the expiration of six months the normal period for taking proceedings under the Summary Jurisdiction Acts and accordingly that proceedings cannot be taken in those cases against the warrantor, since the offence is committed by him at the date when he gives the warranty. The proviso accordingly extends the period to twelve months.Subsection (2) is taken from Section 27 (2) of the Act of 1928. The subsection extends to all prosecutions in respect of articles sampled, and not only to those where an analysis has been made. This is consequential on the alteration of the law made in Clause 69: see note on that clause.Proviso (a) of Subsection (2) provides for the case where samples are taken by or at the instance of an authority outside their district under Subsections (5) or (6) of Clause 68. A similar provision appears in the third paragraph of Section 8 (4) of the Milk Act of 1915.Subsection (3) is taken from Sections 27 (5) and 28 (1) of the Act of 1928, but omits the requirement that particulars of the offence and the name of the prosecutor are to be stated in the summons. These points are covered by the Summary Jurisdiction Acts and the Rules made thereunder.Clause 81. Under Section 28 (3) of the Act of 1928 the production of &quot; a certificate of a public analyst &quot; is sufficient prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein. In reproducing this in Subsection (1) the words &quot; purporting to be &quot; have been added, since in their absence it would be necessary to prove that the document in question was, in fact, a certificate of the analyst. We have also added the words &quot; a document supplied to him by the other party as being a copy of such a certificate,&quot; since other-wise the party who has only a copy of a certificate will be put at a disadvantage.Section 28 (2) of the Act of 1928 provides that where the defendant intends to produce a copy of a certificate by a public analyst a copy thereof is to be sent to the prosecutor. The subsection seems to be founded on a misconception. If the certificate on which the defendant intends to rely is one obtained by the prosecution and a copy has been sent to him by the prosecutor, it is clearly unnecessary for him to notify the prosecutor. If, on the other hand, he intends to produce a certificate which he has himself obtained from a public analyst, he should produce not a copy but the original. Subsection (3) of the clause accordingly limits the obligation to send a copy of the certificate to the prosecutor to the case in which the defendant intends to produce an original certificate.Subsection (4) raises certain general presumptions, and is a combina-tion of several existing provisions which are to be found in the following sections:  Section 116 of the Act of 1875;Section 1 (2) of the Public Health (Regulations as to Food) Act, 1907.Section 19 (2) and (3) of the Milk Act of 1915; and Section 5 (2) (a) of the Artificial Cream Act, 1929.There are other particular presumptions raised by the enactments incor-porated in the Bill, and these together with the clauses in which they are reproduced are as follows:  Section 6 of the Sale of Horseflesh, etc., Regulation Act,  1889 (Clause 37 (4));
Sections 2 (4); 6 (6); 7 and 28 (6) of the Act of 1928 (Clauses 3 (2); 31 (6); 21 and 69 (3); and 42 (5) and 42 (7) respectively); Section 5 (2) (6) of the Artificial Cream Act, 1929 (Clause 26 (5)).Clause 82. This clause reproduces Section 31 of the Act of 1928, but makes it clear that the power of the court to send samples of food or drugs to the Government Chemist relates only to samples produced before the court.Clause 83. This clause is based on three provisions:  (a) Section 18 (3) and (4) of the Milk Act of 1915, which enables the occupier of a dairy who is charged with an offence to bring before the court some other person whom he charges as the actual offender, and to secure acquittal if he proves that he has used all due diligence in the enforcement of the statutory requirements and that the offence was committed without his knowledge or consent;(6) Section 9 (2) of the Milk Act of 1922, which requires a local authority, if satisfied that the offence of which complaint is made was due to the act or default of a servant or agent of a purveyor of milk, to take proceedings against the servant or agent without proceeding against the employer; and(c) Section 27 (6) of the Act of 1928, which enables an employer who is charged with an offence to bring before the court the person whom he charges as the actual offender, and to secure acquittal if he proves that he has used due diligence and that the offence was committed without his knowledge or consent.In cases (a) and (c) provision is made both for the acquittal of the person against whom the proceedings were originally instituted and for the conviction of the party charged as the actual offender. The present clause combines and somewhat elaborates the existing sections and intro-duces provisions based on Section 12 (5) of the Sale of Food (Weights and Measures) Act, 1926, in particular the words &quot; and on giving to the prosecution not less than three clear days&apos; notice.&quot; The form of the clause also follows Section 21 of the Children and Young Persons Act, 1933, in that it enables both the original defendant and the other person to be convicted if the former can prove that the contravention was due to the act of the latter but cannot prove that he himself had taken all due diligence to secure the observance of the Act.Subsection (3) provides, on the lines of Section 9 (2) of the Milk Act of 1922; that an authority may take proceedings against the person to whose act or default an offence may be attributable without first proceeding against the person who may actually have committed the offence. The second paragraph is new. In its absence the subsection would apparently be unworkable.Clause 84. This clause reproduces with amendment Section 29 of the Act of 1928: see paragraphs 30 and 31 of the Report.Clause 85. This clause reproduces Section 30 of the Act of 1928. The following points may be noted:  (a) &quot;Warranty&quot; by Clause 84 (5) includes &quot;invoice&quot;: see para-graph 31 of the Report.(b) The words &quot; principal or agent &quot; have been omitted from Sub-section (2) of Section 30. They do not occur elsewhere in the Bill and the provision should clearly apply to the person responsible for the sale.(c) The words &quot; purchased for analysis &quot; have been replaced by the word &quot; procured,&quot; (Subsection (3)) so as to cover the case of all prosecutions arising from sampling: see also note on Clause 80.
Clause 86. As regards the general question of compensation, see para-graphs 34 to 39 of the Report. The present clause follows the lines of Section 278 (2) of the Act of 1936. The necessary machinery of arbitration is provided by the incorporation of Section 303 of the Act of 1936: see Clause 96.Clause 87. This clause follows without substantial alteration Section 300 of the Act of 1936. It provides the machinery for appealing to a court of summary jurisdiction from a decision of a local authority. By virtue of the next clause an appeal is given to quarter sessions from a decision of a court of summary jurisdiction.Clause 88. This clause follows Section 301 of the Act of 1936 without the proviso to that section, which is not required in the present Bill.Clause 89. This clause follows Section 302 of the Act of 1936.Clause 90. See paragraph 21 of the Report.Clause 91. This clause provides that the Minister of Health shall be the confirming authority for byelaws made under the Bill (Clauses 14, 57 and 59).As regards the provinces, the procedure is laid down by Sections 250 and 252 of the Local Government Act, 1933; Section 251 provides for penalties.As regards London, the only byelaws are those under Clause 14. These will be made by the London County Council, the Common Council, and, if the appropriate order is made under Clause 76, the port health authority. Sections 39-41 of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1934, aPply as respects byelaws made by the county council, and Subsection (2) of the clause applies the provisions of Section 277 of the London Act of 1936 to byelaws made by the Common Council or the port health authority.Clause 92. This clause deals with the three principal sets of regulations: see Clauses 8, 18 and 28. In connection with Subsection (2) (6), see paragraph 39 of the Report. Subsection (2) (c) enables provision to be made for an appeal against a decision of an authority; Clause 87 applies to such proceedings. Subsections (3), (4) and (5) follow the lines of Section 143 (3), (4) and (6) of the Act of 1936. As regards Subsection (6), see paragraph 28 of the Report.Clause 93. This clause reproduces with drafting amendments Subsections (2) and (3) of Section 14 of the Act of 1928. The language of Subsection (2) of the clause follows that of Section 324 (1) of the Act of 1936. We have thought it convenient to retain this special provision, although the general default powers in Sections 321-325 of the Act of 1936 are incor-porated by Clause 96.The provision in Section 14 (4) of the Act of 1928 that a ministerial order shall be regarded as conclusive has been omitted in accordance with the recommendation made by the Committee on Ministers&apos; Powers: see paragraph 22 of Section III of their Report, Cmd. 4060. Section 14 (1) of the Act of 1928 will be found in substance in Clause 65 (1).Clause 94. This clause is new law. In the note on Clause 297 of the Public Health Bill contained in the Appendix to our Second Interim Report we discussed Section 265 of the Act of 1875 which protects members and officers of local authorities from personal responsibility in respect of acts done bona fide in the execution of the Act, and for the reasons there stated we inserted the clause (now Section 305 of the Act) applying that section to local authorities acting under the Act. In the note we indicated that the far-reaching questions of principle involved in the clause might
in future be reviewed by the Law Revision Committee appointed by the Lord Chancellor. We understand that no opportunity for this has as yet occurred and we have once more been confronted with the problem of either incorporating an admittedly difficult and unsatisfactory section, or omitting it, or putting something in its place. It was pressed upon us by the representatives of local authorities on the Committee that the protection afforded by the section was particularly necessary in connection with the activities of officers of a local authority in seizing unsound food, and that there exists amongst local authorities a genuine doubt whether in a case in which an officer acting with the utmost good faith goes outside the law the authority have any power to indemnify him if civil proceedings, whether successful or unsuccessful, are brought against him.The main objection to Section 265, as it stands, appears to be that it may result in a person who otherwise would have a good cause of action finding himself debarred from proceeding either against the authority or against their officer, and it is clear that this situation ought not to be perpetuated in modern legislation. Another objection to reproducing the section in the present Bill is that its operation would thereby be extended to all action under the Milk Acts of 19^5 and 1922 and the Act of 1928 to which the section does not now apply. On the other hand, we think that there is substance in the claim that the authority should have power to indemnify an officer who, acting mistakenly but bona fide, has exceeded his powers. It seems unnecessary to give any such power in a case where the act complained of was done within the scope of the officer&apos;s employ-ment, since, under the general law, the authority in that case would have a power and indeed a duty to indemnify him. AH that is required in this case is to secure that the aggrieved person, who normally would have a right of action both against the officer and against the authority, should be limited to proceeding against the authority. The clause is accordingly drawn on this footing. Subsection (1) relieves the officer of personal liability if the act was done in the execution or purported execution of the Act and was within the scope of his employment, and if he did it in the honest belief that his duty entitled or required him so to do. Sub-section (2) empowers, but does not require, the council to indemnify the officer in respect of acts done under a similar sense of duty but in such circumstances that he is not legally entitled to be indemnified.Clause 95. The alteration made by Clause 64 in the types of authorities who are &quot; Food and Drugs authorities &quot; for the purposes of the Bill, and the power conferred by the clause on the Minister to transfer functions by order, necessitates the insertion of a provision for compensation to officers who, as a consequence of these changes, may find their employ-ment determined or their emoluments diminished. A similar situation may arise in the case of any transfer of functions under Clause 76 or any transfer or relinquishment under Sections 320-325 of the Act of 1936 (incorporated by Clause 96). The clause provides for this and follows with the necessary drafting modifications Section 327 of the Act of 1936.Clause 96. Several sections of the Act of 1936 are incorporated in the Bill by Subsection (1) of the clause. For the most part these sections consolidated &quot; machinery &quot; provisions of the Public Health Acts as regards the subject matter of the Act of 1936. These provisions also apply to the clauses of the Bill which reproduce provisions of those Acts. There are similar enactments scattered through the other Acts which the Bill con-solidates.Subsection (2) makes special provision for the case of London to which the Act of 1936 and the Local Government Act of 1933 do not apply.Clause 97. This clause represents new law. It repeats the substance of proviso (6) to Section 236 of the Act of 1936, which applies to common
lodging-houses registered under that Act, and appears to us to provide a necessary safeguard for the continuance of businesses legitimately carried on.We have thought it better as regards the various registration and licensing clauses contained in the Bill to increase the period of operation from one month, in the Act of 1936, to two months.Clause 98. This clause provides for the repeal of certain provisions of the Bread Acts of 1822 and 1836 : see paragraph 50 of the Report.Clause 99. This clause maintains the &quot;position as regards markets in the Metropolitan Borough of Woolwich, in which, unlike the other London boroughs, the markets are carried on under the Public Health Act code. Part V of the Bill (relating to markets, etc.) does not apply to London.Clause 100. The various terms used in the Bill are defined in this clause.   As regards Subsection (2) (6) see paragraph 32 of the Report.Clause 101. This clause provides for the continuation of documents, etc., issued under enactments to be repealed by the Bill.Clause 102. Subsection (2) of the clause provides for the exclusion of London from Part V of the Bill relating to markets, slaughter-houses and cold-air stores. The differences between provincial and London law in these matters are considerable. In London slaughter-houses and knackers&apos; yards are classified as offensive trades, and the London law in this respect was consolidated in Sections 140 et seq. of the London Act. We felt it inadvisable to make the drastic alteration which assimila-tion of the two codes would have required.Similarly, the provisions as to markets, for which there is no corre-sponding provision in the existing London law, could not be applied to London without seriously affecting the market rights of the City Corporation.Subsection (3), tentatively inserted in square brackets, limits the opera-tion ot the Bill to England and Wales &quot; save as expressly mentioned.&quot; These words refer to Clause 43.   See paragraph 53 of the Report.first schedule.DISEASES OF COWS, AND MILK-BORNE DISEASES.In Part I of this Schedule we have taken the opportunity of bringing up to date the list of diseases in the Second Schedule to the Milk Act of 1915-Part II of the Schedule refers to Clause 36.second schedule.SPECIAL PROVISIONS AS TO THE SAMPLING OF MILK.The Second Schedule to the Act of 1928 is here reproduced. The word &quot; taken &quot; has a special meaning in the Bill, where samples of milk may be either &quot; taken &quot; or &quot; purchased.&quot; The word &quot; procured &quot; has been used throughout the Bill and the Schedule where the reference is intended to be to either method.The first sentence of paragraph (2) of the Second Schedule to the Act of 1928 has been omitted; a sufficient power is contained in Clause 68 (4).The Act of 1928 confers the duty of taking additional samples on the &quot; local authority &quot; who are defined in Section 19 (4) of the Milk Act of 1915 as including the sanitary authority and county council: see para-graph (7) of the Second Schedule to the Act of 1928. Apart from the fact that this is ambiguous, we have thought it better to refer to the Food and Drugs authority, this body having the duty of enforcing the other sampling provisions of the Bill.(46610 26)   Wt. 1802-5685  4000  12/37  p. st,  G. 372
