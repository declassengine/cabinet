(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S GOVERNMENT)S E C RETC.P. 73(58). Copy No.CABINET. THE COURT OF APPEAL.Memorandum by the Lord Chancellor.1. I circulate to my colleagues (attached to thisMemorandum) a Memorandum furnished to me by the Master of the Rolls expressing his view and that of the five Lords Justices.2. Sir Wilfrid Greene&apos;s Memorandum may be summarisedas follows:    The Court of Appeal, as at present constituted of the Master of the Rolls and five Lords Justices, is unable to discharge the work laid upon it by Statute;    none of the Divisions of the High Court is in a position continuously to render such help as is necessary;    it is, therefore, necessary to increase the number of Lords Justices to such a figure as will enable a third Court of Appeal to be constituted when necessary.3. I accept the arguments put forward by the master of the Rolls and I concur in this proposal, and the Chancellor of the Exchequer, with whom I have been in communication, authorises me to say that he also concurs.4. I propose, therefore, that the Cabinet should authorise me to cause a Bill to be prepared for this purpose.5. The position of the Court of Appeal is, however,not the only matter now causing anxiety.    The number of
Judges available for the House of Lords and the Judicial Committee (7 Lords of Appeal in Ordinary and 2 salaried Privy Counsellors with special Indian experience) would be insufficient to discharge the work of those Tribunals if they were not assisted by retired Judges acting as volunteers.    The number of available volunteers is much smaller now than it was a few years ago, and, owing to - the increasing age of some of those upon whom we at present rely, it is likely to be reduced still further in the immediate future.    On the other hands. the work of the Judicial Committee tends rather to increase than to decrease and is likely to increase further when the questions arising under the Government of India Act come up on appeal from the Federal Court.6. The state of business in the King&apos;s Bench Divisionalso requires attention.   &apos;In London that Division appears to be abreast of its work.    But the Peel Commission, and the Committee subsequently appointed under the Chairmanship of Lord Finlay, recommended that two Judges instead of one should in ordinary course go to several towns on the North Eastern and the Western Circuits.    Recentlys particularly on the Midland circuit,  the Judge has been unable in the time available to complete the work to be done there, and it is apparent that two Judges ought to go to several of the towns on that Circuit also    The work to be done on Circuit generally will also be increased by the operation of the Matrimonial Causes Act, 1937&quot;t  though it is not possible to estimate precisely the additional burden caused by that Act. On the other hand, when the Administration of Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill now proceeding in the House of Lords passes into law, it is probable that it will afford some relief to the High Court, particularly on Circuit, but it is not yet possible to estimate the extent of that relief.
For the present, in the uncertainty which arises as to the effect of the Act of 1937 and of the provisions of the Bill of this Session$ I do not propose to ask my colleagues to authorise the passing of a Parliamentary Resolution for the appointment of the two Judges, who, by Statute, may be added to that Division;    but the Master of the Rolls&apos; proposal,  if carried into law, would afford some small and most desirable relief for that Division.7. It will be apparent from the facts and figuresstated by the Master of the Rolls that the services of the three new Lords Justices will not be required in the Court of Appeal during the whole of the legal year.    During the remainder of the year they will be available to sit in any Division of the High Court or in the Judicial Committee. The Appellate Jurisdiction Act, 1913, which authorised the addition of two Lords of Appeal in Ordinary to the number which was at that date authorised by Statute, expressly enabled every Lord of Appeal thereafter appointed,  if qualified to be appointed a Judge of the High Court, to sit as a Judge of the Court of Appeal;    but it laid no obligation upon any such Lord of Appeal to sit against his will.    This provision has for various reasons proved to be almost wholly ineffective.    It would not technically be necessary to qualify the new Lords Justices expressly to sit in the High Court or in Judicial Committee, since they would be, on appointment,, automatically so qualified by the Supreme Court of Judicature (Consolidation) Act, 1925,  on the one hand, and by the Judicial Committee Act, 1833, on the other. I think, however, that it may be desirable to lay upon them, and upon every Lord Justice appointed hereafter, a duty to sit either in the High Court or in the Judicial Committee if called upon.    Thus by this means some small additional help will be found both for the Judicial Committee and for the King&apos;s Bench Division.
8, I raust draw attention to Paragraphs 26,. 27 and 30of the Master of the Rolls&apos; Memorandumunder which it is in effect proposed that the Court of Appeal should in future sit on only four instead of five days a week,    I recognise the weight of the arguments adduced by Sir Wilfrid Greene;, But I should deprecate the introduction of a standard four days a week.    If any such plan were adopteds no appreciable relief could be furnished to the King&apos;s Bench Division from the Court of Appeal., and furthermore the example set would, I think, have its effect upon other Divisions of the Supreme Court,    It may be thats. when any Division of the Court of Appeal has been occupied for many days in trying some particularly heavy case5  some leisure,  in addition to that provided by the practice of not sitting on Saturday,  should be made available for the consideration and writing of judgments..    Neither I nor the Chancellor of the Exchequer could accept a proposal that, as a general rule, the Court should not sit on Wednesday09, The Chancery Division appears to be somewhat morethan able to cope with the work which it has to do.    It may be anticipated that one at least of the Lords Justices to be appointed under the legislation proposed by this Memorandum will be taken from among the Judges of this Division, and will be available on occasion to assist there    On the view . of the Chancellor of the Exchequer that some reduction should be made on vacancies occurring in the number of Judges in this Division,  I am prepared to consider this question with him,  though as there arc prospects of an increase in the work there, and as it may be possible to transfer to the Division work at present done by other Divisions of the High Court, I am not at present wholly disposed to assent to the view that the numbers of that Division can be reduced to four.    I thinks howevers that a case has been made out for some reduction while the volume of work remains as at present;
one way out of the difficulty would he to adopt, in respect of the Chancery Division, the arrangement which has prevailed for some years in the King&apos;s Bench Division whereby the number of Judges is not maintained at more than a certain number, except upon the passing of a Parliamentary Resolution. This arrangementj however, has given great trouble in the past owing to the difficulty of finding Parliamentary time for the Resolution when it is required.    I suggest to my colleagues that we might consider whether a somewhat less rigid plan should be adopted whereby the number in the Chancery Division should on the first vacancy be allowed to remain at five and should be maintained at that figure, unless at any time it appeared to the Lord Chancellor, with the consent of the Treasury^  that the state of business was such as to justify a recommendation to His Majesty that the vacancy should be filled.10.        I propose that legislation should be promoted providing that -(a) three additional Lords Justices should be appointed;(b) an obligation should be laid upon all Lords Justices hereafter appointed to sit in any Division of the High Court in which they may be requested so to sit by the Lord Chancellor,  subject, in the case of the King&apos;s Bench Division, to the consent of the Lord Chief Justice;(c) the first vacancy occurring in the Chancery Division should not be filled, so that the number of Judges in that Division should \ be five, unless and until it appeared to the Lord Chancellor, with the consent of the Treasury, having regard to the state of business in the Division, that it was necessary again to raise it to six.M.House of Lords, 22nd March,  1938.
THE COURT OF APPEAL.Memorandum by the Master of the Rolls*1. The object of this memorandum is to call attentionto the state of business in the Court of Appeal and to submit that present arrangements are not consistent with the due administration of   justice.2. The bulk of the Appellate work in civil matters hasalways been finally disposed of in the Court of Appeal. Since the coming into force of the Administration of Justice (Appeals) Act 1934 on the 1st October 1934 the proportion of appeals which do not go beyond the Court of Appeal has become substantially larger-      Its decisions are now in the great majority ^of cases the decisions of the final Court and their importance as authorities binding  in future cases has correspondingly increased. It is no exaggeration to say that the Court of Appeal is the keystone in the administration of civil justice in this country.3. In present conditions the Court is quite unable todeal with the work entrusted to it.      The situation has been going from bad to worse during the last few years and is now completely out of hand..      It is very earnestly submitted that remedial measures can no longer be delayed.4. The present state of affairs results in seriousinjustice to the litigant and places upon the members of the Court a burden which they ought not to be called upon to bear. Arrears have accumulated and will continue to accumulate at a rapid rate with the result that the work of the Court has to be conducted under a pressure which is most undesirable from every point of view.
an increase of 4-75 4-33 -10 +4138 65 23 67and if County Court appeals be addeda total increaseof      +H3 4-98 +13 +1087. It will thus be seen that even apart from county court Appeals the situation is far worse in the present year than it was in 1933:    and that with the addition of County Court Appeals it is quite out of hand.5. The causes of this state of things are not far to seek-       There is only one remedy;  the constitution of a third division of the Courts      To imagine that two divisions can perform the work cf three is to shut one&apos;s eyes to the plain facts0      The work of the Court of Appeal in England far exceeds the appellate work in Scotland in &quot;both quantity and importance..    Yet in Scotland two Appellate Courts are in permanent session..      The policy of leaving the Court to struggle with its work as &quot;best it can and hoping for the best can only lead to disaster06o Already in the year 1933,  as was pointed out onpage 21 of the Second Interim Report of the Business of Courts Committee (Lord Hanworth&apos;s Committee), arrears were accumulating which required the constitution of a third Division of the Court to deal with theme    A comparison of the figures of the final appeals standing for hearing at the beginning of each term in -that year with those standing for hearing at the beginning of the corresponding terms in the present year is instructivec    If the County Court appeals be eliminated there were in 1937Hilary   Easter   Trinity   Michaelmas 164 133 119 190as compared with1933 89 100 129 149
8. Even apart from County Court Appeals a Court consisting-of only two divisions cannot satisfactorily perform its work.      Under modern conditions appeals tend to become heavier in character.     The complications   of modern business,  the ramifications of modern Company organisation, the complexity of modern inventions and the ever-increasing elaboration and obscurity of modern taxing Statutes (to take four matters only) have added substantially to the length of commercial, Company, patent and revenue litigation.     As an example, one Division was occupied in Trinity Sittings 1937 for 25 days with 3 Patent Appeals of which one took 14 days. The  judgments which fall to be written upon matters such as these are correspondingly elaborate and their preparation and expression must necessarily suffer if they have to be written in a hurry.9. The transfer of County Court Appeals in 1934 withoutany adequate steps being taken to enable the Court to deal with them has had disastrous results.     Some idea cf its effect can be obtained from the following figures. The number of County Court Appeals set down for hearing in each of the years 1934 to 1937 was fairly constant at about 120.      The actual number of days taken in hearing-County Court Appeals and the number of Appeals disposed of were as follows:-Days. Appeals disposed ofIn Court.      Out of Court.1934 25 58 141935 53 110 321936 51 85 301937 35 81 38The reason why in 1957 so little time has been available for County Court Appeals is that the arrears
in other lists were so heavy and long standing that it was necessary to give them priority.      In fact it is impossible to keep one list even reasonably up to date without causing other lists to fall into arrears.10. Upon a reasonable estimate between 50 and 60 days a year are required to dispose of the County Court Appeals -that is to say nearly one-third of the time of one Court or nearly one-sixth of the time of the whole Court. This means that only a little more than five-sixths of the time available in 1933 is free for the remainder of the work ofthe Court, work which in 1953 was more than the Court could-deal with without assistance.-11.        It is instructive to examine the work of the Court during the present year.      At the beginning of Hilary Term there were 202 final appeals standing in the list for hearing as compared with the following figures in the same term in the five preceding years.1932 o   -*   c  0   e   o  o   o  0   e   o      551933 oooeaio   oe*e      8919^4 a c  O c   ooo   ft ft  o o      ^21935 ......... o 148 including 48 County Court1936 . o........ 151 including 41 County Court1937 o o ... o. o c c 202 including 38 County Court.12.        Of the 202 appeals in the list at the beginning of Hilary Term 1937 25 were from the Chancery Division and 109 from the King&apos;s Bench Division.      The comparative figures for the five preceding years are:-Hilary JTerm Chancery King&apos;s Bench.1932 11 261933 16 491934 8 551935 16 631956 26 671937 25 109
Thus in 1937 there were more than twice the number of Chancery Appeals and more than four times the number of King&apos;s Bench Appeals than in 1932.13.        The extent to which the transfer of County Court Appeals is responsible for this progressive increase can be seen from the fact that in the years 1934-5-6 the first two Divisions of the Court between them sat to hear County Court Appealsin 1934 ....... for 12 days1935 ....... for 34 days1936 ....... for 34 days80Notwithstanding the fact that a third Division sat for the purpose of hearing County Court Appealsin 1934 .    .    .    .    . . 13 days1935 c     .     o    .  19 days1936 o    .     o     . 17 days the first two Divisions had to spend 80 days in 1934-36 in hearing County Court Appeals.      In 1934 only Michaelmas Term was affected since it was not till then that the County Court Appeals were transferred.14.       The Royal Commission on the Despatch of Business at Common Law (Lord Peel&apos;s Commission) took two months as the period after which the hearing of a case in the King&apos;s Bench Division ought to be considered as in arrear.     It is considered that no longer period ought to be taken for appeals to the Court of Appeal but for the purposes of this memorandum a period of three months is taken.     At the beginning of Hilary Term 1937 the Chancery and King&apos;s Bench Appeals the hearing of which was in arrear on this basis were as follows:-
Period for which     Chancery     King&apos;s Bench     Totals set down_,i 3More than 9 months 26 to 9 months 5 33 3&amp;ry 443 &quot;to 6 moriijhs &apos;14 71 85Thus over 63 per cento of the 134 appeals in these two lists were in arrear and over 30 per cent, had &quot;been set down for more than six months.15.       In Hilary Term 1937 an attack was made on the King&apos;s Bench list with the result that of the 109 appeals at the beginning of the term 80 were disposed of in Court while 19 were settled out of Court.But this was only done at the expense of other lists.      Of the 25 Chancery Appeals only 8 were disposed of in Court.      Of 38 County Court Appeals only one was disposed of in Courts    of 16 Workmen&apos;s Compensation Appeals none were disposed of in Court.16.       By the beginning of the next term (Easter) the County Court Appeals standing for hearing had risen to 65s the Workmen&apos;s Compensation Appeals to 30.     The Chancery Appeals had risen to 32 while the King&apos;s Bench Appeals were 67.     An attack was now made on the County Court and Workmen&apos;s Compensation Lists.     Of the former9 47i    of the latter? 29 were disposed of in Court.     But this result was only accomplished at the expense of the Chancery and King&apos;s Bench lists.      Of the former only 3.  of the latter only one were disposed of in Court.17.       By the beginning of the next term (Trinity) there were 29 Chancery and 76 King&apos;s Bench Appeals standing for hearing.     As very few Chancery Appeals had been heard during the two preceding terms 21 out of these 29 had--1.1-
&quot;been set down for more than three monthss 9 of them for more than six months.     An attack was made on these two lists with the result that 19 Chancery Appeals and 38 King&apos;s Bench Appeals were disposed of in Court.     No County Court or Workmen&apos;s Compensation Appeals were taken.18.       At the beginning of Michaelmas Term the Chancery and King&apos;s Bench Appeals standing for hearing were 35 and 97 respectively.      Of the Chancery Appeals., 14 (or 40 per cent.) had been set down for more than three months and of those 14s 7 had been set down for more than six months. Of the King&apos;s Bench Appeals,,  48 (or 50 .per cent.) had been set down for more than three months and of those 48s 13 had been set down for more than six months.     Meanwhile appeals in other lists had been piling up.     There were 20 Revenues 12 Admiraltys  67  County Court and 19 Workmen&apos;s Compensation Appeals standing for hearing at the beginning of the term.19.       The comparative figures for the beginning of Michaelmas Term in the years 1932 to 1937 are shown in the following table.
Final Appeals standing in the List for hearing at the beginning of Michaelmas Term.	1932	1933	1934	1935	1936 1	i 1937	Excess in 1937 over 1932Chancery	22	16	21	14	37	35	4. 13King&apos;s Bench	62	98	85	73	110	97	+ 35Probate &amp; Divorce	A	2	2	1	3	3	-    1County Palatine	1	2	1	-	4		*    1Revenue	7	10	4	6	16	20	4 13Admiralty	4	3	7	2	2	12	*    8Admiralty Counts&apos;&apos; Court	-		1	1	-	-	-County Court	-	-	no	35	45	67	H- 67Workmen&apos;s compensation at i on	15	14	19	14	12	19	-f   4Bankruptcy	7	4	2	2	5	4	1    -   3	122	149	J224 i	148	f 234	257	135Thus the number in 1937 was more than double that in 1932. If the County Court Appeals be left out of account the increase is 60 or over 55 per cent.20. At the end of Michaelmas Term 1937 the following appeals in the Term&apos;s List remained undisposed of?Chancery 19King&apos;s Bench 73Probate and Divorce 3Revenue 12Admiralty 6County Court 23
Only 80 appeals in all were disposed of in Court during the term, the smallness of the number being due to the heavy nature of many of the King&apos;s Bench, Admiralty and Revenue appeals.      43 appeals were disposed of out of Court.      During the term 83 further appeals were set down with the result that 215 final appeals were carried over to the next term.21.        It was manifest from the first that the addition of Count:/ Court Appeals to the work of a Court already insufficiently staffed would require the assistance of a Third Division.      The Second Interim Report of Lord Ha.nworth&apos;s Committee (as the result of which County Court Appeals were transferred) makes it abundantly clear that the transfer was recommended on this basis and this basis only (see page 2l).      Lord Peel&apos;s Commission in its Report assumes throughout that this assistance would be forthcoming.      In both these Reports it was contemplated that the necessary personnel would be obtained from the King&apos;s Bench Division to the extent at any rate of two Judges who would be lent to the Court of Appeal as often as required.22.        This machinery has completely broken down.      Since the transfer of County Court Appeals in Michaelmas Term 1934 the only periods for which it has been possible to constitute a third Court have been as followsi-
Michaelmas 12 days 1955Hilary 10 daysEaster Nil )    TotalTrinity Nil S    21 daysMichaelmas 11 days )1956Hilary Nil )Easter 23 days ]    TotalTrinity 5 days    ;    42 daysJMichaelmas 9 days    )Of these days Lord Wright (then a Loro. of Appeal in Ordinary) sat for 12 and the President of the Probate Divorce and Admiralty Division for 39.23o        It has not been possible to constitute a third Court since Michaelmas Term 1936.      During the current year every attempt to do so has met with failure owing to the impossibility of obtaining any assistance from the King&apos;s Bench Division.      Now that the strength of that Division has been reduced from 19 puisne judges to 17 - at which figure it is apparently to remain - all hope of con-stituting a third Court for even a short period by borrowing judges from that Division must be abandoned.24.        The effect of what has been done can be summarised intwo sentences.(A) Acting on the recommendation of a Committee which(l) reported that the Court of Appeal requiredassistance to enable it to deal with its existing work.(2) recommended the transfer of County Court Appealsto the Court of Appeal in order to relieve theKing&apos;s Bench Division.-15-
(3) made this recommendation upon the basis thatthere would be a surplus of puisne judges (then 19 in number) in the King&apos;s Bench Division available to enable the Court of Appeal to deal with its work. Parliament transferred County Court Appeals to the Court of Appeal.(B) Notwithstanding the fact that with the number of King&apos;s Bench Judges at 19 the assistance which could be obtained was quite inadequate their number has now been reduced to 17.The only possible conclusion that can be drawn from these facts is that Parliament has completely failed to recognise the place occupied by the Court of Appeal in the judicial system of this country.25.       The resulting situation is unfair both to litigants and to the members of the Court.     Litigants are compelled to wait a quite undue length of time before their appeals can be heard.     The available time must be distributed as fairly as possible between the various lists and appeals which cannot be reached during the time allotted to their list have perforce to wait until their turn comes round again. The Chancery and King&apos;s Bench lists in which the more important appeals are to be found, have to suffer an additional delay owing to the priority which in accordance with a long standing practice is, wherever possible, given to Workmen&apos;s Compensation and Revenue Appeals.      There is little doubt that many litigants settle their appeals in despair of getting them heard within any reasonable time.26.       Prom the point of view of the Court itself, the position is no less unsatisfactory.      Its work has to be done under
a sense of stress caused &quot;by the arrears which confront it. It sits throughout the whole day for five days a week. Unlike the House of Lords which has one day a week free in which its reserved opinions can he discussed and prepared the Court of Appeal has to perfoim these tasks out of Court hours.     When a Court has on hand not more than two or three reserved judgments it is possible to cope with them without undue strain, except in the case of heavy judgments of the kind already referred to.     But when the number of reserved judgments begins to rise above these figures it is quite impossible to reserve more judgments without imposing an intolerable burden on the members of the Court and causing undue delay before judgments are delivered.      In the result,  judgments which it would be desirable to reserve in order that they might be expressed in considered language have to be delivered extempore. The majority of judgments which the Court delivers during a year do not, of course, need to be reserved.      But in view of the fact that the Court is now,  save in exceptional circumstances, the final Court of Appeal,  it is more than ever desirable that in cases of difficulty or importance which are likely to find a place in the Reports,  its decisions should be carefully discussed and prepared. In present circumstances this is often impossible and it is considered that it is not in the public interest that the work of the principal Appellate Court in this country should have to be conducted in so unsatisfactory a manner.27o        In the House of Lords and in the Privy Council there is no sitting on one day a week in order that judgments may be prepared.      The same is the case in Scotland.      Alone of all Appellate tribunals in Great Britain the Court of Appeal is expected to sit continuously for five days a week, dealing with cases of great difficulty and importance
and working under great pressure ana at the highest possible speed.      It is considered that the judgments of the Court of Appeal i-equire as much time and care in their preparation as those of the House of Lords;    and that a Court of the importance of the Court of Appeal should be able to do its work in circumstances which will enable its members to give their best both as regards the decision of individual cases and as regards the written record of their judgments which form authorities binding in future cases.28.        It is considered that no half-measures will meet the situation whicli it has been the object of the preceding paragraphs to expose.      To transfer the County Court Ap]. sals back to the King&apos;s Bench Division would of course relieve the pressure to a considerable extent.      But it is thought that this would be a retrograde step.      It would also have a discouraging effect upon the County Court Judges who feel that their status has been raised by the fact that appeals from their decisions go direct to the Court of Appeal.      It is a mistake to think that County Court Appeals are simple or unimportant..      Many of them raise difficult and important questions of lav/ and judgments in such cases require careful consideration and expression.      Cases often arise under social legislation the decision in which will affect large bodies of persons.29.        It is considered to be equally unsatisfactory to increase the number of Judges of the King&apos;s Bench Division with a view to providing a surplus on which the Court of Appeal could draw.   Apart from the fact that there is no guarantee whatever that judges would be available as often and for as long as required,  the system of making up a third Division in this way has all the appearance and all the disadvantages of a makeshift.      There is no means of
ensuring that the Judges available will be suited by temperament or experience to the work of an Appellate Court;    and it is both undesirable and distasteful for the responsible head of the Court of Appeal to be placed in the position of having to refuse to take some particular Judge who is offered to him.      Moreover a Court so constituted does not command the confidence of the litigant in the same waj/ as a permanent Court..      Litigants expect and are entitled to expect that what in the majority of cases is the last Court to which they can appeal shall be a true Appellate Court and not a makeshift.30o        It is considered therefore that if the dignity and prestige of the Court is to be up-held,  if it is to keep abreast of its work,  and if it is to have the opportunities which an Appellate Court ought to have of preparing its judgments with deliberation, the only solution is to constitute a permanent third Division of the Court by the appointment of three more Lords Justices .      Three Divisions sitting four days a week (the fifth day being occupied in the preparation of reserved judgments) would mean an addition of some 80 Court days a year.      Taking 55 days a year as the time required for hearing County Court Appeals this would leave 25 days which would be required for dealing with existing arrears and the excess of work (other than County Court Appeals) which normally exists as stated in paragraph 6 above.      It is of course not possible to forecast the future course of business with any accuracy.      It may be that when existing arrears have been dealt with there will be a certain number of free days for one of the Divisions,.      On the other hand if the existing delay in the hearing of appeals is removed it is more than probable that appeals will come to hearing which would otherwise be settled owing to the inability ofr    -19-
litigants to get their appeals heard.      If, however, any-free days prove to he available there should be no difficulty in making use of them.     The King&apos;s Bench Division will always be glad of the temporary loan of a Lord Justice, and the Privy Council is often in need of an addition to its strength.31.        This memorandum is based on the position as it was at the end of Michaelmas Term 1937.      It expresses the view of all the Lords Justices namely Greer, Slesser, homer, Scott and MacKinnon L.JJ. as well as that of the Master of the Rolls.January 1938.
