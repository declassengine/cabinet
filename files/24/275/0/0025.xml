THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   March 1.938.SECRET.CP. 61 (38).CABINET.QUESTION OE THE TRANSFER TO THE UNION OF THE GOVERN-MENT OF THE HIGH COMMISSION TERRITORIES IN SOUTH AFRICA.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.1. SINCE the Cabinet had before them on the 16th February my memo-randum CP. 28 (38) on this subject there have been the following further developments: (a) In reply to my letter of the 27th January (Appendix C in CP. 28 (38)),General Hertzog sent me a letter, of which I attach a copy together with copies of subsequent messages exchanged through the High Commissioner (Appendix I).(b) The Union Cabinet have now approved the terms of the proposed joint statement (Appendix D of my memorandum CP. 28 (38)) and also the texts of the memoranda which they propose to issue subsequently. A copy of these memoranda is attached (Appendix II).2. As regards (a), it will be seen that General Hertzog queried the phrase &quot; full acquiescence of the populations concerned,&quot; which occurred in the aide-memoire of 1935. The passage in which the phrase occurred is : &quot; The conclusion which we draw from the above considerations is that the policy of both Govern-ments for the next few years should be directed to bringing about a situation in which, if transfer were to become a matter of practical politics, it could be effected with the full acquiescence of the populations concerned.&quot; General Hertzog appears to have assumed that the phrase in question extended in some way the pledges which the United Kingdom Government have given from time to time regarding the conditions of possible transfer of the administration of the Territories. This, of course, is not the case. Our attitude has always been that it would be very difficult-if not quite impossible to arrange for transfer unless it can be carried through with the goodwill of the natives whom we are pledged to consult, though our pledges do not bind us to obtain the actual consent of the populations of the Territories. As will be seen from my message of the 25th February to General Hertzog (Appendix I), I told him that I was quite prepared to accept that the words &quot; full acquiescence &quot; in the context above should be interpreted as meaning &quot; goodwill.&quot; The General has now agreed that the wording of the aide-memoire of 1935 can stand, and as I do not think that the discussion on the point need be pursued, I have asked the High Commissioner to confine himself to thanking General Hertzog orally for his last message.3. With regard to (b), since the memoranda were originally prepared some of them have been revised in various respects as a result of certain comments offered by Sir William Clark.   The memoranda consist of : A. A document setting forth the system of government which would be established, in accordance with the terms of the Schedule to the South Africa Act, upon the transfer of the government of the Territories to the Union.Copy No.     ^ V
B. The Schedule to the South Africa Act.C. A document setting forth the advantages, economic and otherwise, whichmight be expected to result, particularly to the natives in the Territories, from transfer.D. A document setting out the special benefits likely to accrue to theEuropean inhabitants of Swaziland and the Bechuanaland Proteo-torate.E. A memorandum on the native policy of the Union Government.4. Document A is, in the main, a plain statement of facts, and no exception could, I think, be taken to its terms. Document B is a quotation and document D calls for no special comment. As regards document C, it would be possible to suggest some improvements of wording (e.g., to remove any possible implication that the United Kingdom Government is not already spending considerable sums of money on the economic development of the Territories), and I am considering the question of drafting amendments of this nature. In addition I consider that in the sentence reading &apos;&apos; Upon transfer of the Government, the Territories would, as near as possible, become part and parcel of the Union as an economic and political unit,&quot; the words &quot; and political &quot; ought to be omitted. Under the Schedule to the South Africa Act, the Territories would not become politically part of the Union.5. I feel considerable doubt about document E which, in the nature of the case, is only a one-sided statement of the Union Government&apos;s native policy. I never had it in mind that the Union Government should prepare any such document; they have added it only recently to the others; and it has not the same relevance to the question of the Territories as have the other documents. I regard it as in quite a different category to the others.6. In the proposed joint statement it is explained that it is intended that the memoranda prepared by the Union Government should be made available for the information of the Native and European inhabitants of the Territories. I am informed, however, that the Union Government do not propose to issue the memoranda until after the General Election in the Union, which will take place on the 18th May, and there will therefore be an opportunity to discuss with Sir William Clark (who is coming home on leave at the beginning of next month) the procedure to be adopted with regard to the circulation of the memoranda. My present view is that any facilities wrhich we might give for bringing the contents of documents A, B, C and D to the notice of the inhabitants of the Territories should not be extended to document E; but the whole question of the nature and extent of such facilities requires further consideration, and I will raise it later on with my colleagues, after consultation with Sir W. Clark.7. I would draw my colleagues&apos; attention to one point of special importance in document A. My colleagues will recall that I pointed out, towards the end of my letter to General Hertzog, which is printed as Appendix A in CP. 28 (38), that in view of the changed constitutional position since the South Africa Act was passed it was desirable to consider what alternative security should take the place of Sections 20 and 25 of the Schedule to that Act. These sections provided respectively that the King may disallow any law made by the Governor-General in Council by proclamation for any Territory after transfer, and that all Bills to amend or alter the provisions of the Schedule shall be reserved for the signification of His Majesty&apos;s pleasure. General Hertzog, in his reply (Appendix B in CP. 28 (38)), argued at some length that the practical effect of these Sections always was and would have been of negligible value to the inhabitants of the Territories, and that the administration of the Territories, when transferred, must be a matter purely for the Union Government. It will be seen that as a result of subsequent discussion, the Union have included in document A the following assurances: &quot; Upon transfer, His Majesty&apos;s Government in the Union of South Africa would institute the system of government outlined in the Schedule to the Sduth&quot; Africa Act, 1909, and no departure from the terms of the Schedule is contemplated by His Majesty&apos;s said Government. If, however, at any time after transfer any alteration in the terms of the Schedule should be contemplated by Plis Majesty&apos;s Government in the Union of South Africa in respect of the Territories referred to in the Schedule, or of any of them, His Majesty&apos;s said Government undertake to
consult with His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom in case the latter should have any observations to offer, and to give due consideration to such observations before making such alterations.&quot; This concedes the most important point, and may be regarded as a sufficient substitute for the Section in the Schedule relating to the power of reservation. As regards disallowance, I think it must be accepted that this was always of formal rather than practical importance, and that the responsibility for the general administration of the Territories after transfer must rest with the Union Government. In the light of the present constitutional position Ave have secured a considerable concession, and I do not think that we need press for anything to be added to the proposed undertaking.   I recommend that we should accept this.8. The Union Government desire to issue the joint statement forthwith, and I do not think that there is anything in the first four memoranda which need cause us to ask for further delay. As I explained during the last discussion of the question in the Cabinet, there are reasons why, from our point of view also, early publication is desirable. For example, it will allay a number of false rumours which are circulating in this country and in the Territories, such as that General Hertzog and I are negotiating for the immediate transfer of Swaziland. I hope, therefore, that my colleagues will agree to the issue of the joint statement on such date in the immediate future as may be agreed with the Union Government.
APPENDIX I.Letter from. General Hertzog to the Secretary of State.Prime Minister&apos;s Office, Dear Secretary of State, Capetoivn, February 16, 1938.I AM in receipt of your letter of the 27th January, 1938, and agree that we should now see in what practical ways we could make further progress.To revert, however, very briefly to the discussions in 1935 between Mr. Thomas and myself, I find it necessary to state that His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment in the Union of South Africa construe the last sentence of the second paragraph on page 1 of the Draft Joint.Statement as superseding the phrase &quot; full acquiescence of the populations concerned &quot; appearing in paragraph 4 of the Aide-Memoire of 1935.In other words, His Majesty&apos;s Government in the Union construe the said Aide-Memoire as containing no reference to the phrase &quot; full acquiescence of the populations concerned,&quot; and as not going further than the pledges which were given during the passage of the South Africa Act through the United Kingdom Parliament, the one relevant in the present context being that transfer should not take place until the wishes of the natives of the Territories had been most carefully &apos;   considered. ,With kind regards,Yours sincerely, (Signed) J. B. M. HEETZOG.The Rt. Hon. Malcolm MacDonald, M.P.(ii) Telegraphic Message from the Secretary of State to General Hertzog. (Handed to General Hertzog by Sir William Clark on February 25, 1938.)Sir William Clark has telegraphed to me the terms of your letter of 16th February.My understanding of the position is as follows. There is no question of altering or adding to the pledges which were given during the passage of the South Africa Bill in 1909. These are summarised in paragraph 3 of our proposed Joint Statement.What you and my predecessor were concerned with at the time of the aide-memoire of 1935 was consideration of the policy to be adopted during the next few years. This was expressed as &apos;&apos; directed to bringing about a situation in which, if transfer were to become a matter of practical politics, it could be effected with the full acquiescence of the populations concerned.&quot;In your letter of 29th December you said that you assumed that no more was meant by the word &quot; acquiescence &quot; than &quot; goodwill towards the idea of transfer to the Union.&quot; As Sir William Clark has explained to you, I am quite prepared to accept that the words &quot; full acquiescence &quot; in the aide-memoire should be interpreted as meaning goodwill. I should have no objection to your saying publicly that you so interpret the expression, and I should be prepared to do the same.On this understanding I hope that aide-memoire of 1935 can stand. Serious difficulty would arise here if we were now to seek to omit phrases in that document.(iii) Letter from General Hertzog to the Secretary of State, dated March 1, 1938.My dear Secretary of State,Sir W. Clark has handed me your message relating to my letter of the 16th February, 1938, and I note with much pleasure that there is no question of adding to or altering the pledges given during the passage of the South Africa Bill, 1909. With regard to the actual terms of the aide-memoire 1935, in order to avoid anything which might Have the semblance that I have at any time agreed to a modification of the 1909 pledges, I propose in future to stress measures of effective co-operation upon which His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United
Kingdom and of the Union of South Africa have agreed, rather than to deal with the significant phrase &quot; full acquiescence of the populations concerned,&quot; and possibly you may decide on a similar course of action.As I appreciate your difficulties with regard to this matter and have made my own position clear, I agree that no useful purpose could be served by insisting at this stage on an actual alteration in the terms of the aide-memoire 1935.APPENDIX II.Draft Union Memoranda. Document &quot; A.&quot;Document setting forth (a) the system of government which His Majesty&apos;s Government in the Union of South Africa would propose to institute, and the extent to which, if any, the Union system would differ from the present system;(&amp;) the readiness of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the Union of South Africa to take over serving European and native officials in the Territories;(c) The main principle upon which representation would be given to European inhabitants of Swaziland and Bechuanaland Protectorate in the Union Parliament.(a)&quot; Proposed system of A dministration.Upon transfer, His Maiesty&apos;s Government in the Union of South Africa would institute the system of government outlined in the schedule to the South Africa Act, 1909, and no departure from the terms of the schedule is contemplated by His Majesty&apos;s said Government.If, however, at any time after transfer any alteration in the terms of the schedule should be contemplated by His Majesty&apos;s Government in the Union of South Africa in respect of the territories referred to in the schedule or of any of them, His Majesty&apos;s said Government undertake to consult with His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom in case the latter should have any observations to offer, and to give due consideration to such observations before making such alterations.A copy of the schedule to the South Africa Act is hereto annexed marked &quot;B.&quot;The existing form of administration would substantially be maintained, except for minor necessary administrative adjustments, if any.Powers and status of the Chiefs would continue unchanged.While at present legislative power is vested in the High Commissioner, it would, upon transfer, become vested in the Governor-General in Council.At present administration is exercised by the Resident Commissioners under the direction of the High Commissioner. Upon transfer, the Resident Com-missioners would be appointed by the Governor-General in Council, and would exercise their administrative functions under the direction of the Prime Minister.The Prime Minister would be advised on matters of administration and legislation by a Commission of not less than 3 members, the constitution and functions whereof are dealt with in Sections 2 to 10 of the said schedule.There would be no impairment of native rights and interests and alienation of land in Basutoland or alienation of land in native reserves in Swaziland and Bechuanaland from the natives and sale of intoxicating liquor to natives would be prohibited.There would be free trade and intercourse between the Union and the Territories.(b) Position of European and native officials in Territories.Section 22 of the schedule in question provides that rights as existing at the date of transfer of officers of the public service employed in any Territories shall remain in force.
(Document &quot; B &quot; is the schedule to the South Africa Act and is not enclosed.)Document &quot; C.&quot;Document setting forth the advantages, economic and others, which might be expected to result to the inhabitants of the Territories from the transfer of the government of the said Territories.Introductory.Before setting out the advantages which might be expected to result to the inhabitants of the Territories from transfer of the government of the said Territories to the Union, it is necessary to emphasise that, by reason of their contiguity and of the fact that the Union Government have for many years succeeded largely in maintaining a policy of free trade and intercourse, the Territories have automatically participated in, and derived large benefits from, the economic, agricultural and industrial progress which is proceeding apace in the Union of South Africa.The markets of the Union, which, as a result of the Union&apos;s legislative measures and economic progress, have succeeded in developing and maintaining a satisfactory price level in respect of both primary and secondary products, are of vital importance to the Territories.notwithstanding continuous protests from Union farmers against competition from the Territories, the Union Government with, generally speaking, only one important exception, viz., the restriction relating to the introduction of cattle, have succeeded in maintaining a policy of free intercourse.Moreover, in spite of the weight restrictions and controlled markets on the Witwatersrand, the Union has afforded, and continues to afford, a highly remunerative outlet for large numbers of cattle from the Territories.Similarly, as a result of the Union&apos;s policy of free intercourse, no immigration restrictions are placed upon natives entering the Union from the Territories.In 1921 the number of these natives in the Union was 101,814. In 1937 the number was 215,519.None of the Territories can in the long run survive as independent economic units. As has already been pointed out, they are, in fact, to-day living largely on development which has taken place across their borders, and if they did not have easy access to the Union which they now enjoy, their position would long ago have become impossible.The question inevitably arises whether the position as it prevails at present can be maintained. ..As the territories produce largely for the Union markets and in competition with it, it may become merely a question of time whether it will be possible to resist the demands of the Union producers for the raising of tariff barriers against the products of the Territories and for the complete prohibition of entry of stock from the Territories.It is hardly necessary to be stated that only by means of transfer of the government of the Territories could the inhabitants of the latter permanently ensure to themselves equal treatment with the inhabitants of the Union.Upon transfer, His Majesty&apos;s Government in the Union of South Africa would undertake to take over serving European and native officials of the Territories upon conditions set forth in the said Section 22.(c) Parliamentary representation of European inhabitants of Swaziland and Bechuanaland.Upon transfer, His Majesty&apos;s Government in the Union of South Africa would undertake to ensure that representation in the Parliament of the Union of South Africa would be accorded to the European inhabitants of Swaziland and Bechuanaland, upon the same principle as governs the Parliamentary representa-tion of Union citizens.The position of the said Europeans would, for example, be the same as that of the European inhabitants of Transkei.
Document &quot; D.&quot;Document setting forth benefits which are likely to accrue to European habitants of Swaziland, and Bechuanaland from transfer.In addition to the advantages the European inhabitants might expect to derive under certain of the paragraphs appearing in document &quot; C,&quot; European farmers in the above two Territories would be entitled to the benefits of the many schemes that have been established for the relief of the farmers of the Union, among which might be mentioned : (i) Loans from the Land and Agricultural Bank of South Africa, includingadvances to farmers for the purchase of land, for improvement, redemption of bonds and others, for irrigation and water supplies, fencing, dipping tanks and silos; and general advances to Co-operative Bodies.(ii) Advance under the State Advances Recovery Act 1935 and the Farmers&apos;Assistance Finance Act, 1935, for the purchase of stock and for the rehabilitation of farmers who got into financial difficulties owing to the depression.A advantages which might be expected to result from transfer.In addition to securing for the inhabitants the maintenance of their present favourable position, the following advantages may be expected to result from transfer :  Upon transfer of the government, the Territories would as near as possible become part and parcel of the Union as an economic and political unit.Apart from securing absolute freedom in the Union markets and the removal of restrictions placed on the introduction of cattle, the Territories would be placed in a very favourable position to take their natural place in the economic structure and development of the Union.For example, the Bechuanaland Protectorate, as ranching area, would be granted a free movement of feeder-cattle to the maize area of the Union, and Basutoland might further develop the production of hard wheats, of which there is a scarcity in the Union.The present low land values prevailing in Swaziland may be expected to improve.Gradually, and as the process of economic and general adjustment takes place, it is likely that the Territories would derive full benefits which may be expected to accrue to comparatively undeveloped countries as a result of their closer association with and incorporation into an advanced and progressive state.Consequently it may be expected that in due course the Territories will share in the organised activities of the Union which has reached a far higher stage of economic development. This will result in considerable benefit to the Territories, for it must be accepted that the financial and technical resources of the Union will in the course of time, as required, be extended to these areas and that transport facilities will be increased in order to tap the resources of the Territories and hasten their development.The Territories will derive material benefit from medical, veterinary and agricultural services already extended by the Union to its natives and which will be further developed as time goes on.The Union&apos;s national policy of combating soil erosion, of water conservation, afforestation, veld-reclamation, and improvement of roads and bridges, are matters in which the natives of the Union and of the Protectorates cannot but share the general improvement in the advance of the white man.Native Agricultural Schools have been established in the Union at which native students receive instruction in the science and practice of farming, and these institutions also serve as training centres for native agricultural demonstra-tors whose function it is to prove to their people the advantages of improved methods of cultivation, selective stock breeding, &amp;c. Experimenal and demonstra-tion farms have been established in the native areas in the Union and numerous bull and ram camps have been established at suitable centres in connection with the grading-up of native live-stock in the Union. These facilities could be made available to the inhabitants of the Territories in addition to such provision as has already been made under these heads.
Document E.Memorandum on the Native Policy of the Government of the Union ofSouth A frica.The Union of South Africa contains a population of two million Europeans and over six million natives, while in the rest of the continent of Africa there is estimated to be a population of 130,000,000 Africans, including 60,000,000 of Bantu origin, who have strong racial and cultural affinities to the natives within the Union.In its ultimate native policy there were two roads which it was possible for the Union to follow, one, that of the development and assimilation of Black and White into a single community, the other, their residential separation and parallel development as two distinct communities. Politically, the Union had to adopt either the principle of a common citizenship for Black and White alike, ending ultimately in a coloured or black South Africa, or the white race had to face up to its responsibilities of leadership as trustees of a separate native community within the borders of the Union.Previous to Union different views of the policy which should be adopted towards this problem had been held in different parts of South Africa, and the position at the date of Union was complicated by the diverse character of legis-lation in the four colonies, and the varying degrees of civilised advancement to which the different sections of the natives had attained. Since 1910, however, there has been a gradual acceptance of the conception that residential separation and parallel development of the races provided the only solution, the white community retaining the position as the governing race and acknowledging its responsibility as trustees for the protection and advancement of the native races.The first step towards the adoption of this policy was the Natives Land Act of 1913, which tentatively made provision for the separation of European and Native interests in land. That Act was intended merely as a temporary measure to prevent any further inter-mixture of interest in land, until the whole question of what division of interests should be made could be thoroughly investigated and fully considered. It dealt only with the question in relation to rural areas. Its counterpart in respect of urban areas, the Natives (Urban Areas) Act, passed in 1923, provided for separate residential areas for Europeans and non-Europeans in the cities and towns of the Union, and for regulating the influx of non-Europeans into the cities and towns beyond the limits of their absorptive capacity.The complete acceptance of the policy of parallel development and trusteeship was foreshadowed in the Native Bills introduced into Parliament in 1926, and these bills have formed the basis of the policy of the Government of the Union since that date. For eight years they were under consideration by Select Com-mittees of both Houses of Parliament and the final Act adopted in 1936 was accepted practically unanimously. Some harmonisation between the different views has been achieved but, in essence, the legislation is an unequivocal national acceptance of the policy of trusteeship as opposed to that of a common political franchise.It was recognised from the outset that the provision of more land for the natives was indispensable to the foundation of such a policy, and this need has been met by the Native Trust, and Land Act, 1936.Land Policy.For many years the natives had been handicapped by the want of sufficient land, and South Africa&apos;s failuve in the past to set aside sufficient land in view of future native expansion is recognised as a mistake that is at the root of many of our difficulties in native policy. The object of the Native Trust and Land Act, 1936, is to set aside further areas where natives can maintain a reasonable standard of life and develop their own traditional institutions. The Govern-ment&apos;s policy of separating land held by natives and Europeans was recognised
Total     ............     10,422,935These areas comprised all the then existing native reserves or locations throughout the Union, and land privately owned by natives for tribal purposes, but were not sufficient to meet the growing needs of the natives. The Native Trust and Land Act, 1936, has added to the existing areas further areas of land described as &quot; released areas &quot; which will, it is hoped, meet the needs of the natives and give effect to the policy of institutional and territorial segregation. These areas are reserved for native occupation and no Europeans may acquire land in them without the permission of the Governor-General.The Act establishes a. corporate body called the &quot; South African Native Trust,&quot; with the Governor-General as Trustee, in which are merged all existing Native Trusts and special funds, and in which are vested the existing locations and reserves and most of the Crown land in the scheduled and released areas. The establishment of this Trust represents the extension to the whole Union of a policy of entrenching native interests by the formal establishment of a fiduciary body, the main function of which is to promote the material, moral and social welfare of the native people.The Trust administers a fund known as the &quot; South African Native Trust Fund,&quot; which derives its income from moneys appropriated by Parliament, and from rents and other profits accruing from the land under its control, and these funds are being used for the purchase and development of native land, for education, for the advancement of the agricultural and pastoral interests of the natives, and generally for the well-being of the native people.Within the scheduled or i&quot;eleased areas the Trust has power to acquire land for native settlement until the extent held by it amounts to seven and a quarter million morgen, distributed as follows :-Province. M or gen.Cape        ............... 1,616,000Natal       ............... 526,000Orange Free State       -......... 80,000Transvaal............... 5,028,000Total     ............      7,250,000It is a principle of the scheme that native settlement should be fostered on the land so acquired and that the white man should be excluded from it.Since the passing of the Act the Government has taken active steps to give effect to its provisions. So far, Parliament has provided grants amounting to  2 million for the purchase of land by the Trust, and the whole of this sum has already either been spent or committed to the acquisition of land for native settlement.  Further sums will be placed on the estimates for ensuing years.In addition to the purchase of more land for natives, far-reaching schemes are being undertaken for the improvement and economic development of native areas, and a total sum of  778,187 has been placed on the estimates for the coming financial year for these purposes and  888,300 for native education, apart from the ordinary expenditure on health services and district administration provided from the Consolidated Revenue Fund.Natives in Urban Areas.While the new policy under the Native Trust and Land Act provides large areas for natives living their tribal life and preserves to them their own institutions on land set aside for their exclusive occupation, the urbanised or-detribalised natives present a separate problem.   Indeed, the influx of nativesin the Natives&apos; Land Act, 1913, in terms of which certain areas were scheduled as native areas as follows : Province. Morgen.Cape        ............... 6,217,037Natal       ............... 2,972,312Orange Free State -      ......... 74,290Transvaal ...       ...       ......... 1,159,296
into urban areas, with its disintegrating influence upon native life, has during recent years become one of the most serious problems which the Native Administration has to face.The Natives (Urban Areas) Act of 1923 was (as already stated) the comple-ment of the Natives Land Act of 1913 in the application of the policy of &quot; segregation &quot; to urban areas as contrasted with rural. With its amending Act of 1930 it was an attempt to provide for the protection and control of those natives residing in the cities and towns of the Union. Tactful administration of the Act has secured a great improvement in the conditions in which the natives live in urban areas, but this improvement of conditions, together with the other attractions of town life and the demand for labour has only increased the complexity of the problem by accentuating the influx from the country.While the Act, with a measure of success, enabled the segregation policy of the Union to be carried out in the towns, it was not able to stem the influx of natives who have no prospect of employment and who become a source of embarrassment to the community and a liability to the local authority. This drift to the towns not only tends&apos;to throw the labour market into a state of chaos, but it is one of the things that is most seriously undermining the morality and family life of the natives.The Native Laws Amendment Act, 1937, contemplates the more efficient regulation and control of this undesirable movement from country to city.It strengthens the powers of the local authorities to restrict the influx of natives into their areas and empowers the Governor-General also to enforce such control where the local authority has failed to do so. In case of an undue influx in future the Act provides for the removal of surplus natives, either to the areas that are being acquhed under the Native Trust and Land Act, 1936, or to rural areas selected by the natives themselves and approved by the Minister.The employment of foreign natives in the towns (other than mines) can be restricted, but this restriction does not apply to natives from Basutoland, Swaziland and Bechuanaland Protectorate.Native Political Representation.Previous to the recent legislation the position as regards direct parliamentary representation of the natives was that, except in the Cape Province, it was practically non-existent, and even there, wdiere political equality of the various races was recognised, the number of natives on the Voters&apos; Roll barely exceeded 11,000 out of a total electorate of 410,300.The Representation of Natives Act, 1936, introduces a uniform system of native representation for the whole Union, the effect of which is a separation of political representation as between black and white. It allocates to the native population of the Union as a whole four European senators to be elected by them, in addition to the four nominated under the South Africa Act. For this purpose, the Union has been divided into four electoral areas :  (a) The Province of Natal,(b) The Provinces of the Transvaal and Orange Free State,(c) The Transkeian Territories, and(d) The Cape Province excluding the Transkeian Territories.Each of these electoral areas has the right to elect one senator, not by direct vote, but by means of electoral colleges consisting, in the case of the Transkei, of the native members of the United Transkeian Territories General Council, and in the other areas of the native chiefs and headmen, and the native members of local councils and other native representative bodies, the vote of each electoral college having a value according to the number of native taxpayers it represents.In so far as the House of Assembly and the Provincial Councils are concerned, in the Northern Provinces the natives have never had the vote, but in the Cape Province they have, and the Act therefore gives to the Cape native an independent voice both in the Assembly and in the Cape Provincial Council.With this object in view, the native franchise in the Cape Province has been preserved on a separate native voters&apos; roll and the Cape native voters have the right to elect three European members to represent them in the House of Assembly, and two European members in the Provincial Council.
In addition, the Act established a Natives&apos; Representative Council for the Union, which deliberates upon all matters of concern to the natives and upon all legislation specially affecting them. This Council consists of 22 members, with the Secretary for Native Affairs as Chairman. There are sixteen native members, twelve of whom are elected by the electoral colleges and four nominated by the Governor-General, and with them sit five Europeans, the Chief Native Commis-sioners for the Union. Except for the Chairman&apos;s casting vote, only the native members have the right to vote.It is the function of the Council to report to Parliament through the Minister of Native Affairs upon any proposed legislation affecting the natives, any matter referred to it by him, and any other matter affecting the interests of natives in general, and no bill or draft ordinance which, in the opinion of the Minister after consultation with the Native Affairs Commission, or the Administrator of any province concerned, contains provisions specially affecting native interests, may be introduced until it has been referred to the Council for its consideration.The Minister of Native Affairs is also required to place before the Council the financial proposals of the Government for the purchase of land and for education and other purposes in so far as they affect the natives. The Council will then report through the Minister to Parliament their views as to the amounts to be given and the way in which these should be spent for the various purposes of native education and development.The effect of this important innovation is to give the natives all over the Union a voice in their own affairs, which they have never had before.While the actual passing of laws still remains in the hands of Parliament and of the Provincial Councils, the Natives Representative Council will, through its powers of recommendation and suggestion, have an important influence as to what the provisions of those laws will be.The elections contemplated by the Act have been carried out and the Natives Representative Council held its first meeting at Pretoria on the 6th December, 1937.Tribal Government and Native Councils.As already stated, the natives have attained to various stages of development in their tribal life. In some parts, like Zululand, the old tribal system still continues Avith much of its former vigour, while in others again, like the Transkei, different degrees of disintegration have set in. In the latter areas the system of elective councils has been introduced and functions to the great benefit of native advance and development.It is the policy of the Government, in areas where the tribal system is still strong, to recognise the chiefs as a means of government of the people, and to confer upon chiefs of good character civil jurisdiction in native disputes and criminal jurisdiction in respect of petty offences committed by members of their tribes.In the areas, however, where there has been a gradual disintegration of tribal control, it is the policy to extend the council system which has already been applied with such marked success in the Transkei and other territories.
