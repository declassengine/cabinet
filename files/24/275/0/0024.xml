Memorandum by the Secretary for j lines. COAL DISTRIBUTION COSTS.1.    On 7th February, in the Committee stage of the Coal Bill, a proposal moved by certain supporters of the Government that there should be a public enquiry into the operation of the Coal Selling Schemes in force under the Coal Mines Act, 1930, was rejected by the House of Commons on a    division.    During the debate it was made clear that, generally speaking, the Committees of Investigation set up under the Act could deal effectively only with the prices charged by colliery owners to the first purchasers,  and net with the/prices charged to consumers by middlemen.    A number of Members thereupon pressed for an enquiry into the margins between the pithead prices of coal and the prices to consumers.    On 15th February, in answer to questions, such an enquiry was refused by me, but I called attention to the fact that the question of the margins between wholesale and retail prices of coal v/as at present being reviewed by the Selling scheme Authorities and by representatives of the distributors.    This statement did not stem the pressure from representatives cf all parties in the House for an enquiry into coal distribution costs, and on 17th February, the prime Minister stated that it was under the consideration of the Government.    A secondary matter, originally raised by a Conservative Member but now made much of by the Labour Opposition, concerns the subsidiary distributing companies of the collieries \ ; and the possibility that they might be able to make large profits by selling at high prices to consumers;    it is argued that some part of those profits should go into the colliery proceeds, on which the miners&apos; wages are based.2.    Part I. of the Coal Mines Act, 1930, provides for regulating and facilitating the production, supply and sale of coal by owners of coal mines;    hence, the application of the
Schemes in force under that Act is limited to owners of coal mines.      It is only in respect of functions exercised under the Schemes that the aid of Committees of Investigation can &quot;be invoked.3.  The present agitation in parliament and among consumers is in fact directed against the limitation that the 1950 Act imposes.      The critics point out that a large proportion of coal sold does not pass direct from colliery owner to consumer hut through intermediaries.      They say that the powers conferred &quot;by the Act have done away with competition in this industry and have tended to canalise coal distribution.      They claim that the opportunities for the intermediaries to make undue profits have consequently increased, hut the consumer has no means of redress nor even of having his grievances investigated.4. Although the 1950 Act provides only for the control of sales by owners of coal mines, certain provisions are included in some of the District Selling Schemes which would enable the Scheme Authorities in agreement with the distributors to exercise a measure of control over distribution costs on a first resale.      This would &quot;be effected through the establishment of a register of distributors, admission to which would he contingent on the acceptance of conditions and terms of resale prescribed by the Scheme Authorities and agreed with the distributors.      These provisions were approved by the Lav/ Officers as &quot;incidental to&quot; those controlling sales by colliery owners.      They rest on a very narrow foundation;    a foundation that is, indeed,  so narrow as to be quite insufficient to support a superstructure designed to control the whole of the distributive trade,5. Tho permissive provisions of the Schemes referred to in the previous paragraph, for agreements to &quot;be made between the Scheme Authorities and the distributors, would enable the
first resale prices to be brought within the scope of the Committees of Investigation.      A substantial proportion of coal sold passes, however,  through the hands of more than one intermediary;    and the control of the first resale price would not,  therefore, be sufficient to meet the present criticism by consumers:    moreover there is no statutory power to compel intermediaries to enter into any such agreements with the Scheme Authorities.      As the House of Commons has been informed, negotiations between some Scheme Authorities and representatives of the distributors are proceeding but the problems to be solved in connection with these agreements are many and complex, and it is doubtful whether, when they wereNcompleted, they would in all cases be in. such a form as would definitely bring the middlemen&apos;s margins within the scope of the Committees of Investigation.      The object of including provisions in the Selling Schemes to cover agreements with distributors was to prevent tinder cut ting by middlemen and thus to ensure the effectiveness of the schemes in increasing proceeds at the pit.      The agreements would not necessarily be of a type which would cover the converse -overcharging by distributors.6. Assuming, however, that a number of agreements were made between the Scheme Authorities and the middlemen which would bring distribution costs within the ambit of the Committees of Investigation,  the question that will doubtless be ashed in the House is:    &quot;What powers are there which would enable airy recommendations that the Committees may make with regard to those costs to be implemented?&quot;     Frankly, no satisfactory answer to this very pertinent question can &quot;be given.      The middleman can never have any function under a Selling Scheme;    hence,  the Committees of Investigation cannot make recommendations directly to those middlemen.      If a Committee considers that a margin fixed under a voluntary agreement between the Scheme Authority and the
distributor is too high and so informs the Scheme Authority,  that Authority cannot without the consent . of the other party to the agreement secure that the terras of the agreement are varied.    It could give notice of termination;    it coulu endeavour to negotiate a variation of the terms;    it could threaten to remove recalcitrant distributors from the register ana thus to force them out of business.      1&apos;his would enable the coal producers to deal with one distributor, or even a few distributors, who refused to fall in with the general scheme;    but it woula be quite useless for the purpose of dealing with the whole body of distributors if they insisted upon a margin which the Committee of Investigation considered too high.      As a distributor is not directly and legally bound by the provisions of the statutory Schemes,  and is not therefore directly subject to supervision by the Committees of Investigation,  it will be realised that no sanctions can be exercised effectively against the distributor;    nor can they at present be aevised,  since existing legislation is limited to the owners of coal mines. Moreover,  it is to be remembered that many distributors are not in membership with the organisations that claim to represent the distributive trade,  aud such plans as those organisations have discussed for putting the uistribution of coal on a better basis have been urawn up in the interests of the industry itself,  and have neither pretended to benefit nor have held out any hopes of benefiting the consumers.7.    So much for the possibilities of using either existing legislation or voluntary action by the distributors to control distributors&apos;  costs.      On the other haad, an enquiry into distribution costs is also not without serious difficulties. On many occasions since the War the question of distribution costs has been examined, either ad hoc or as part of a general enquiry into the coal industry.
The results of all these enquiries, some of which werecai ::ied out by professional accountants of standing(e. g.  in connection with the 3amu.el Commission, 1925),were inconclusive.    To quote the Samuel Report:    &quot;Theredo exist between producers and consumers substantial margins of profit or expenses which might be narrowed to theadvantage of one or other, or both of them ,................The practical measures that will secure this end of narrowing the distributors&apos; margins are not easy tosuggest&quot;.8.      Since the last formal enquiry in 1925 into the coal distributive trade there has been a major change in the industry:    the productive  side is now subject to statutory control.    That is, in effect,  the essence of the case of those who are pressing for an enquiry into coal distribution cost&apos;.;.    Their argument is presented in alternate--     forms: either that,  if coal as a basic industry requires statutory powers of regulation, it is illogical to limit that regulation to the productive side only - the distributive side of the industry is equally, if not more, in need of regulation;    or that the regulation that exists on the productive side is bound to operate  so as to remove competition,  and has therefore placed the distributor in a -position where he can without check surreptitiously increase his margin to the detriment of the consumer.-   If, under conditions, le ss favourable to the distributor, enquiries have consistently shown that his margin of profits and expenses ought to bo narrowed, the changed conditions of to-day are,  suggest the critics, prima facie evidence that those margins arc in greater need of reduction.    At all events, they say, the operation of those margins should be investigated.    The argument is a formidable one to moot in Parliament and in the country.
9. It is necessary at this stage to consider just what sort of enquiry could be given and how far it might extend, ho doubt it would be possible for a Committee to investigate the margins between prices at the pithead and those charged to the large industrial consumers.     An enquiry limited to this extent, however, would not have much value, since large consumers are in practice quite well able to look after themselves;    many of them buy direct from the collieries, and those who buy through factors know enough of the coal market to judge what the margin is, and are able to see that they get full value for the factorage charge.      And if this were suggested, it would, I fear, prove quite impossible to resist the demand that the enquiry should be extended to cover the domestic consumer and the small industrialist who buys through a merchant.10* An enquiry which covered the domestic consumer and the small industrialist would be extremely difficult, since there are such a large number of separate units in the distributive trade - many times greater than the number of those on the productive side of the industry.     Conditions vary so much between the different parts of the country; between a town and its outlying suburbs;    between one village and another;    and indeed even between one part of a town and another part.      It would seem, therefore, that it would not be easy for such an enquiry to make any definite suggestions on which the Government might act.     But, on the other hand, they would almost inevitably find that in some cases too great a margin exists between the pithead price and the price at which the coal reaches the small consumer. Effective legislation would be almost impossible to devise without assuming some measure of responsibility for the retail trade when it is remembered that experience in attempting to control commodities during the War convinced
most,  if not all,  of those directly concerned that it was not in practice possible to control the retail price of an article unless the article itself passed into the possession of the controlling authority immediately after production and was subject to control through every intermediate stage until it reached the consumer.11.    To sum up.   . The Government is faced with the following alternatives:(a) To resist the demand for an enquiry into the price margins in the distribution of coal, plausible and reasonable as such a demand can be made to appear,  and await the results of the present negotiations between the Scheme Authorities and the distributors (in spite of the fact that these are not on a national basis, are likely to take a long time, may not produce very satisfactory results and in any case would have no sanctions behind them).(b) To give way to the demand for a committee of enquiry into the costs between the Scheme selling prices and the prices to all consumers, which would in my view reduce,  if not eliminate, much of the opposition to the Coal Bill from the consumers1 point of view, but which might as the result of its recommendations involve the Government in great difficulties at a later stage. The terms of reference to such a committee of enquiry might be: To enquire Into the orgauisation and methods of distribution of coal, coke and manufactured fuel;    to investigate the various items which go to make up the differences between the prices received by the producers and those paid by the consumers,  and to make recommendations. Such an enquiry would be a public one, excepting when the committee itself decided that it was advisable for them to hear evidence from either firms or individual persons in private.In spite of the obvious risks which may emerge from the report of such an enquiry,  I feel that in present circumstances we have no option but to announce that a committee will be set up for the purpose, aud I recommend accordingly.H.
