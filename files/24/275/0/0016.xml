THIS DOCUMENT is THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S GOVERNMENT). SECRET.CP..  52 (38). COPY NO.cabinet.calcium  carbide, caledonian poker bill.Note by the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence.I am advised that the Second Reading of this Bill may be anticipated soon after the middle of MarchoThe result of the Cabinet discussion on the 17th November last (Cabinet 42 (37) Conclusion 7) on the various issues raised by it was stated in a question and .... answer on 18th November, of which a copy is appended tothis noto.i am advised that since the decision of the Cabinet, -the British Oxygen Company have (1) as regards the proposed factory in south Wales, been engaged in negotiations with the Railway Company concerned and with the owners of the limestone and hope to reach substantial agreement before the Second Reading debate - the desirability of this has been pressed on them.    Their plans for the factory are complete, awaiting only agreement a.? to the leases, and they propose to generate their own electricity;    (2) they have set on foot negotiations with the Scandinavian interests with a view to a future quota arrangement for imports of calcium carbide -the matter is understood now to be before the Governments concerned;    (3) they have continued attempts to conciliate local opposition in the Highlands - with substantial success &quot;v..        in the case of the County Councils of Inverness and of Ross and Cromarty; without success in the case of the Inverness * Town Council and the fishing and amenity interests.
It would appear accordingly that there may still he considerable opposition to the Second Heading of the Bill, though the grounds for that opposition seem to me to be mainly matters susceptible of a reasonable(measure of adjustment in Committee.    The Scottish members generally supported the last Bill.    The Welsh members opposed it, but I am advised by the British Oxygen Company that their attitude has been changed by the decision to establish a factory at Port Talbot and that they are not likely to oppose the Bill on the ground that the whole undertaking should be in South wales.The points on which I have to seek Cabinet guidance are(a) what arrangements should be made to state the Government case in support of the Bill in the debateNon Second Reading;(b) should any special arrangements be made as regards securing support of the Government view, the case being one in which the Government whip cannot be appliedAs regards (a), the case for the Bill is the defence interest, supported by the desirability of establishing a new and important industry in the Highlands.    On the last occasion the Secretary of State for Scotland spoke on behalf of the Government.    It is for consideration whether he should do so again or whether the matter should be treated as primarily defence, in which case it would seem fitting that I should support the Bill on behalf of the Government.As regards (b), it would be well that the Secretary of State and I should together discuss the position with the Chief Whip well before the debate, so that any action judged appropriate and useful can be taken in good time..(lnt*ld) T. W. H. I.Whitehall Gardens, S. W.1. 3rd March, 1938.
APPENDIX.PARLIAMENTARY D/iBATTJ.House of Commons - Official Report. Defence (Calcium Carbide ?-roduction) .CAPTAIN A. 3VANS asked the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defence if he is now in a position to make any statement with regard to the report of the Calcium Carbide Factory Investigation Committee;    and whether it will be possible to make arrangements to encourage the erection of such a factory in South Wales?SIR To  INSKIP&apos;:     Yes, Sir.     The committee after full consideration of a number of schemes submitted to them for the production of calcium carbide and allied products in the united Kingdom, recommended the scheme submitted to them by the British Oxygen Company-     This scheme provides for the erection of two factories, one at port Talbot in South Wales,  the other at Gorpach in the West fiighlands.     The company have assured me that pending their obtaining the necessary powers for the Corpach factory they intend to proceed at once with the erection of the factory at Port TalhotD      On this basis the scheme is regarded by the Government as satisfactory and I understand that the Compaq?&quot; are taking the necessary steps to re-introduce the Caledonian Water power Bill.
