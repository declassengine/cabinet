draft statement RELATING TO DEFENCE.I.The Statements relating to Defence, presented to Parliament in March. 1985 (Cmd. 4827), and March 1936 (Cmd. 5107), explained the circumstances which led His Majesty&apos;s Government to the conclusion that steps must be taken to make good the serious deficiencies which had accumulated in all the Defence Services, and outlined the objectives aimed at in the plan which had been drawn up for the reconditioning and modernisation of our defence forces. The Statement presented to Parliament in February 1987 (Cmd. 5874), dealt mainly with Defence expenditure consequent upon the wide range necessarily covered by the programme and the growth in the complexity and cost of new armaments generally, and gave an indication of the order of magnitude of the expenditure which must be contemplated.2. The scope of the present paper is necessarily different. The essential features of the policy underlying the defence programme remain unchanged, and what is needed is rather a survey of the progress achieved, with reference to such changes in organisation or to such special requirements as are likely to be of interest. The paper proceeds upon the assumption, now almost universally accepted, that the steps taken by His Majesty&apos;s Government to make good our defences are unavoidable, and that they furnish a steadying influence on the present state of international relations.It will be appreciated that for reasons of public interest, this survey must, for the most part, be expressed in general terms, and that it is impossible to give specific details as to, for example, the output of any particular type of equipment. In some particulars the information will inevitably overlap with that in the separate Memoranda accompanying the Estimates of the Service Departments.3. The general lines on which it was proposed to expand capacity for the production of armaments was explained in the White Paper of February last. A number of new factories have been brought into production, and others are under construction. Existing factories are working to a high level of output.4. It is not to be expected that no set-backs should be encountered in a programme of this magnitude, which, moreover, includes the development of a number of articles of new design. For example, the full expansion of production necessary to enable the programme to be completed within the time originally contemplated has made demands for certain types of skilled labour which could not be met without some delay, the more so as it has been the policy to avoid any interference with the requirements of private industry. The helpful co-operation of all concerned has done much to diminish the difiiculties of the situation.&apos; but constant attention to this aspect of the programme is required, if the best results are to be obtained from the very large outlays made on the erection and equipment of factories. Regarding the task as a whole, it can be said that, while delays and difficulties have been experienced, and deliveries have not, in some cases, come up to anticipation, progress has on the whole been satisfactory. The difficulties hitherto encountered have been largely met and the rate of production is now rapidly increasing.5. The supply position in regard to essential raw materials has been kept under continuous survey and further action has been taken as found necessary in the course of the survey to provide for reserves in certain cases.6. To turn to the Services ^individually, the speed with which the strength of the Royal Navy is being increased is shown s by the following figures of tonnage building at successive dates : II.January 1, 1985January 1, 1986January 1, 1987January 1, 1988189,845 281,925 875,740 547,014
(i)    Page 3, paragraph 7,  line 4;9This line should, read -&quot;concerned, of       Battleships, Cruisers and aircraft Carriers.&quot;,      / (Note:    The numbers are to be filled in later,)
During the year April 1988-march  1939 some sixty new vessels of all classes are expected to be put into service, representing a total of over 130,000 tons.7. The programme of new ships to be laid down in 1938 has been planned in accordance with the principles stated in the preceding White Paper, and will consist, so far as the larger types of ships are concerned, of Battleships, Cruisers and Aircraft Carriers.Modernisation of existing ships is continued expeditiously. The work on one capital ship has been completed; three others are in hand for this purpose.8. As regards the Army, the accumulation of the necessary war reserves is proceeding on a large scale. In the production of nearly all the major articles of armament and equipment for which new designs are being adopted, the stages of design and development are already ended, or are within sight of completion. The present year should see warlike stores of modern pattern in growing use and, what is equally important, the potential means for maintaining and replacing such stores in time of war will be keeping pace with actual issues.9. A certain amount of equipment, including vehicles, of modern pattern has already been issued to the Territorial Army, and it is expected that, later in the year, the situation will allow of these issues being substantially increased. As an interim measure, arrangements have been made for the loan of weapons and transport from Regular Army sources for use during the forthcoming camping season. The scale of vehicles for Territorial Army Units this summer will be largely increased.10. The new types of aircraft were for the most part placed in production before the construction and testing xif prototypes. This policy which was deliberately adopted in order to reduce delay to a minimum has involved certain initial difficulties, but it has enabled new types of aircraft to be delivered to squadrons much earlier than would have been possible under the methods used in the past. The types in question have shown a high degree of performance. The equipment, including many new and improved types of armament, and instruments, has come fully up to expectations, and deliveries are now proceeding satisfactorily. As a further step to ensure maximum production, the number of types of aircraft in the Service is being progressively reduced, so that not only can a clear run be obtained in each factory on a single type, but it is also possible to arrange for several factories to be engaged in the production of one type.11. Manufacturing capacity has been substantially developed to provide a sufficient supply of aircraft, engines and equipment. The six shadow factories for the manufacture of engines have already begun production. One of the two airframe shadow factories is expected to begin production a few weeks hence and the other later in the year. Other shadow factories for airscrews and carburettors have also started production, and a shadow factory for bombs is on the point of doing so.III..12. Concurrently with industrial requirements for armament production, the defence programme involves a large number of works services, many of them of considerable magnitude. An instance is the additional storage accommodation, entailing heavy expenditure, for the accumulating reserves of all kinds of the three Services.13. Good progress has been made with the Army Works Services for bringing barrack accommodation up to modern standards, and providing the workshops and buildings required for modern mechanised forces, both at home and abroad. A large building pro-gramme is also being carried out to provide the new type of accommodation which is necessary for the units and equipment of the two Anti-Aircraft Divisions; the majority of such units have now been provided with accommodation, either permanent or temporary.

14. The total number of new aerodrome sites acquired since the expansion programme started is 59; of which 30 are now occupied by units. The total number of new Air Force stations of all types con-structed or under construction since expansion started is 65, without taking into account large additions or alterations made to a number of existing stations.IV.15. The organisation of recruitment and training in all three Services lias received special attention. Not only are recruits being entered in greatly increased numbers, but the complexity of modern warfare requires the adoption of a higher standard of training.16. To keep pace with the growing strength of the Fleet, naval personnel has expanded at a steadily increasing rate. Additions were made to total numbers of approximately 3,000 during the years 1938 and 1934, and of approximately a further 10,000 during the years 1935 and 1936. In the year 1937 an increase of over 10,000 has been planned, a figure twice as large as has ever before been attempted in peace, the effect over the five years being an expansion of about 25 per cent.   In 1938 an increase of 7,000 is in contemplation.*17. There is every reason for confidence that the higher level of entries will be maintained. Actually, during the first three quarters of the year 1937, over 11,000 recruits have been entered for the Navy. Some difficulty has been experienced in the past year in obtaining skilled tradesmen, owing to the demands of the re-armament programme, but the position in this respect is showing most satisfaetory improvem ent.18. The rapid rate of expansion of naval personnel has taxed to the utmost the organisation for recruiting, training and drafting. At many naval training establishments building has been undertaken to accommodate the larger numbers receiving instruction. The Caledonia (late s.s. Majestic), the new boys&apos; training establishment at rosyth, has proved invaluable and her location has been followed by an increased entry of boys from Scotland.19. A number of measures have been taken to facilitate and encourage Army recruiting. These measures fall under two headings : revision of the qualifications for enlistment and improve-ments in conditions of service. Under the first heading, physical and educational standards have been adjusted to suit the duties of the various arms, and in certain Corps the age limit has been raised. Under the second heading there have been increases of ration allowance and of recruits&apos; kit allowance, the improvement of messing and accommodation, the abolition of &quot;holding&quot; for an extra year&apos;s service abroad and the granting of permission to soldiers over 21 years of age to sleep out of barracks. During 1937 3,000 more recruits were taken than in the previous year.20. Last August men serving in sections A and B of the Army Reserve were invited to rejoin the Colours; up to the end of January some 2.600 had done so.21, The year 1987 was a record recruiting year for the Terri-torial Army, 45,820 recruits being obtained and the strength of all ranks being increased by 17,690.22. In the Air Force, training facilities have been greatly extended both for pilots and technical personnel, and further exten-sions will be made. The number of Service flying training schools has been increased from four to eleven, and they have also been relieved entirely of elementary flying training which is now carried out at thirteen civil flying schools. The number of armament training camps has already been increased from three to seven, and others are to be opened later.28. Notwithstanding theuncrease of the numbers under training, experience shows that the new pilots are entering the service squadrons from the flying training schools with a higher standard of flying efficiency than formerly.. Since April 1985, approximately 4,500 candidates have been accepted for training as pilots, and* Tho figures are for financial years.
40,000 airmen (including 6,300 apprentices) mostly for training in skilled trades, as compared with a normal pre-expansion entry of approximately 350 pilots and 1,000 airmen a year. Recruitment both of officers and men must be maintained at a high level for some time to come, and it is essential that there should be no relaxation of effort and public support.24. The Eoyal Air Force Volunteer Reserve, which was recently established to create a reserve of pilots and other personnel, is working very satisfactorily and will be further extended. The estimated pilot entry for the year April 1937-March 1938 was 800, but this programme has already been exceeded, and over 1,000 entrants for the pilot reserve have been accepted, since April 1937. The number of centres so far opened is 21, and 12 more will be opened in 1938.V.25. Detailed plans are being worked out by the Admiralty and Air Ministry to give effect to the decision taken in July 1937 for the transfer to the Admiralty of the Administrative control of the Fleet Air Arm. The Air Ministry will be responsible for the training of pilots up to the point when their specialised training begins, after which the Admiralty will assume full responsibility.26. Of the four new infantry battalions and two new Army tank battalions referred to in the White Paper of February 1937, two infantry battalions and one tank battalion have been, formed, and very satisfactory progress made in building them up to establishment. It is hoped to raise the other tank battalion shortly. The Mobile Division is now in being as a formation, and will train as such this year. Arrangements have been made with the Government of India which will make it possible to continue the mechanisation of cavalry regiments.Certain of our overseas garrisons have been strengthened, and further increases are in contemplation; steady progress has been made in improving the defences of our overseas bases.27. In the process of building up an adequate home defence Air Force, the metropolitan strength was raised during the past year to 123 squadrons; the corresponding number in 1934 was 52 squadrons. The present force comprises 68 bomber squadrons, 30 fighter squadrons, 15 squadrons of general reconnaissance aircraft and torpedo bombers, and 10 Army Co-operation squadrons. The necessary organisation is being developed to enable the Force to operate with the maximum efficiency. Further stages of expansion will take the form of increasing progressively the number of squadrons, their size and establishment. Now that the initial stage of rapid expansion of the structure has been completed, it will be possible to plan the creation and expansion of squadrons in such manner as to conduce best to the operational efficiency of the Force as a whole.28. The development of active ground defence against air attack has continued throughout the year. More units have been converted to form part of the expanded second Anti-Aircraft Division, and others have been converted and reorganised for Coast Defence purposes. Between April and December, 1937, the two Anti-Aircraft Divisions increased their strength by 345 officers and over 9,000 other ranks. The new types of weapons and equipment to which reference was made in last year&apos;s White Paper will shortly be issued. Special attention is being given to the protection of vulnerable points.29. A successful start has been made with the balloon barrage scheme, most of the material for which has already been delivered. Sufficient regular personnel have been fully trained to enable them to supervise, and train in their turn the auxiliary personnel who will be primarily responsible for manning the barrage. Recruiting of the auxiliary personnel, which awaits the completion of the necessary stations, is expected to start in May.80. As regards the system of organisation, the Air Ministry is responsible for the air defence scheme as a whole and the anti-aircraft units of the Territorial Army, which provide the gun and searchlight\
defences, come directly under the Air Officer Commander-in-Chief, Fighter Command, for operations in war and combined training in peace. Plans are prepared in a joint Committee, the membership of which includes the Anti-Aircraft Divisional Commanders and repre-sentatives of the operations branches of the War Office and Air Ministry, the Air Officer Commander-in-Chief, Fighter Command, being Chairman. The latter has on his staff two General Staff officers from the Army. The Anti-Aircraft Divisional Commanders have their Headquarters with the Commanders of the Fighter Groups in peace. In all operational matters there is direct communication between Headquarters, Fighter Command, and the Anti-Aircraft Divisions.31. The measures for the protection of the civilian population against the consequences of air raids have been taken an important stage forward by the Air said Precautions Act, 1937, under which the duty of preparing comprehensive schemes for the purpose has been placed upon Local Authorities, with substantial financial assistance from the Exchequer in respect of approved schemes. The underlying principle is that while the schemes will be prepared under general guidance from the Home Office, and in respect of some parts of them under central direction, they will be framed for the require-ments of each Local Authority area, thus ensuring the action best adapted to the needs of the locality, and the flexibility without which the scheme might break down in emergency. Air raid precautions depend fundamentally upon a wide diffusion of knowledge among the people of the country, and upon the enrolment and instruction of large numbers of volunteers for the local organisation of public duties.32. The Local Authorities have already received information on the matters which they should include, both in general air raid precaution schemes and also in fire precaution schemes. Broadly, they are required to provide for the instruction of the public, the enrolment and instruction of voluntary personnel for air raid wardens, first aid parties, first aid posts, &amp;c, arrangements to deal with the dangers. of poisonous gases, a survey of accommodation locally available which could be used, with adaptation where necessary, for public shelters, the organisation of the hospital services for casualties, the organisation of emergency fire services, co-ordination with public utility undertakings, lighting restriction and warning systems, as well as the preparation of preliminary material on which the Secretary of State could, if the emergency arose, give directions as to evacuation.33. The Air said Precautions Department has been strengthened and additional numbers of regional Inspectors are being appointed, who will be able to give up-to-date information and advice to the Local Authorities in the preparation of the details of their schemes.34. A general training school for Air said Precaution Officers of Local Authorities is being opened in London. About 25 to 30 officers will attend each course which will last between two&quot; and three weeks. The two schools for anti-gas measures are now fully in operation and a course for superintending instructors in the measures for dealing with incendiary bombs is also beginning. In addition local schools or courses of instruction for air raid wardens and for first aid parties are being set up by Local Authorities in steadily increasing numbers.85. A large proportion of the gas respirators required to supply the whole civilian population is already available and the balance will have been obtained by the end of this year; these will be stored in a number of central stores, and quantities of them will be released for storage by Local Authorities as soon as the Authorities have made their arrangements for storage. Similarly the supply of protective clothing for volunteers who will be actively engaged in the schemes proceeds regularly, and arrangements are being made for its partial distribution to Local Authorities.86. Advice to industrial and commercial undertakings as to the simple and inexpensive measures which they can and should take in order to give reasonable protection to the persons employed in them, has been given in the form of handbooks and additional memoranda are nearing issue.   In addition, discussions are proceeding
18th February, 1938.with public utility undertakings as to the steps which can be taken for the maintenance of essential public services of power, light, water, &amp;c. As already announced, in respect of certain special measures additional to those which all employers will be expected to undertake, His Majesty&apos;s Government will be prepared to make a grant to the undertakings towards the cost.87. As regards the emergency fire precautions, the principal elements are a complete system of fire fighting patrols, i.c, working on regular beats and not dependent upon the ordinary fire brigade stations; they will be for the most part equipped with trailer pumps, with heavy machines in support for fighting the large fires and making use of water supplies of all kinds to supplement the supplies in the mains.38. The Home Office, working in conjunction with the Office of Works, is responsible for the design, production and issue of the equipment for the use of the Local Authorities as their schemes develop. As the result of co-operation with various manufacturers orders have already been placed for 8,000 light trailers; these are fire pumps coupled up to an engine and mounted on a light chassis which can be towed by an ordinary motor car. In addition, orders have been placed for 200 trailer machines of larger pumping capacity as patrol vehicles for areas of heavier fire risk in big buildings. Large-scale production of this type will be in progress this year.Further experiments have led to orders for five types of heavier duty machines primarily for station works, i.e., fighting conflagra-tions and as booster pumps. These types will probably produce radical changes in the design of ordinary fire engines; they cost about half as much as fire engines of comparable power. Investigation is also proceeding into the development of other types which will economise in the use of water.89. Defence planning comprises a variety of tasks beyond, though often closely related to. the work of the Home Office in the sphere of passive precautions, for organising our industrial and economic resources for operation in time of war. Schemes are being prepared to ensure the sufficiency and operation of the various transport services, the contingency being envisaged in the general plans of a possible diversion of sea-borne traffic from East Coast ports to West Coast ports. Supplementary to the military plans for the defence of trade and the protection of important points against air attack, the maintenance of adequate supplies of food and feeding-stuffs, including a proper system of control and distribution, has occupied a prominent place in the work. Schemes are proceeding for the maintenance of oil supplies, including measures for conserving the use of oil in emergency and providing alternative methods of propulsion.
