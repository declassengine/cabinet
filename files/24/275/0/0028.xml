This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government,Printed for the Cabinet, March, 1988SECRET.Con- No. zj 2CP. 64 (38).THE CABINETTHE ARMY AND AIR FORCE (ANNUAL) bill memorandum BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR1. I circulate herewith the Army and Air Force (Annual) Bill, with a prefatory     110 memorandum explaining the amendments of the Army Act and Air Force Act. General51652. As Clause 4 will have the effect of rendering inoperative a provision of the Indian and Burma civil law, I ought, perhaps, to explain more fully the reasons for it. Section 136 of the Army Act and the Air Force Act provides that the pay of officers, soldiers and airmen shall be paid without any deduction other than deductions authorized by Act of Parliament, by Royal Warrant, or by any law in force in India or Burma. Section 60 of the Code of Civil Procedure which applies to both India and Burma renders half of the pay of officers serving in India or Burma (less the first 100 rupees), liable to attachment under orders of a civil court, in satisfaction of debts. The military authorities in India have for a long time pressed that this provision should be annulled on the grounds : -(i) that in no other part of the Empire is the pay of officers liable to suchattachment;(ii) that the Indian Army Act and Burma Army Act protect the pay of all indian and Burman officers from such attachment (including the pay of the new Indian commissioned officers) ; (iii) that the activities of Indian money lenders, which are a menace to young officers and to their military efficiency, would be curbed if officers&apos; pay could not be attached in satisfaction of their debts.It is most unlikely that the Indian Legislature would agree to amend the Code of Civil Procedure, and I therefore propose, with the concurrence of the Secretaries of State for India and Burma, to achieve this object by amending the Army Act in the manner proposed in Clause 4. At the request of the Government of India a proviso has been included which will ensure that good notice of the change in the law is given in India.3. As regards Clause 5, under the Army Act at present a soldier must be appointed to a Corps, and once he has been so appointed he cannot ordinarily be transferred to another Corps without his consent. As we have now decided, in order to meet the case of a man seeking a career in the Army, to recruit a limited number of men for long service, it would seem advisable to take the power of compulsory transfer from Corps to Corps in such cases so as to allow a greater flexibility in their -employment. These amendments provide the necessary statutory authority for soldiers to be enlisted on these terms.4. As regards Clause 7, which regulates the situation as regards powers of cora-mand when Royal Air Force officers and airmen are attached to the Indian (or Burma) Air Force, no provision for a similar contingency is needed in the Army Act.5. As my colleagues are aware, this Bill must receive the Royal Assent by 30th April, but, owing to the incidence of Easter, it will probably be necessary for it to be passed by both Houses before the adjournment. I therefore desire to circulate it immediately after its First Reading, which follows automatically on the conclusion of the Report stage of Vote A of the Service Departments&apos; Estimates.L.

Army and Air Force (Animal) Bill.MEMORANDUM. Clause 4.The object of this clause is to prevent any part of the pay of officers, soldiers and airmen from being attached under orders of a court in India or Burma in satisfaction of debts contracted to tradesmen, moneylenders and others. Such attachment is not possible now outside India and Burma and even within India and Burma it is not possible in the case of persons subject to the Indian Army Act, the Indian Air Force Act or the Burma Army Act.The proviso contains a saving for the rights of creditors whose debts were incurred before the end of this year, by which time the provisions of this clause may be supposed to have become reasonably generally known.Clause 5.The object of this clause is to enable recruits enlisted in the Army for a period of twelve years, the whole of which is to be served with the Colours, to be so enlisted upon the terms that they shall have the right to re-engage at the expiration of the twelve years for a further nine years unless for particular reasons it is undesirable that they should be allowed to do so. At present, though re-engagement may be allowed, a man has no actual right to re-engage unless he has attained the rank of sergeant. Subsection (2) of the clause provides that persons who are enlisted on these terms shall be liable to be transferred from corps to corps.Clause 6.The object of this clause is to repeal the provision which declares that &quot; hospital apprentices&quot; in India and Burma are to be treated as warrant officers even though they hold no warrant. There is now no such thing as a hospital apprentice and accordingly the para-graph is obsolete.67-5 A
Clause 7.This clause enables the Air Council to attach Royal Air Force officers and airmen (but in peace time only with their consent) to the Indian Air Force, and to the Burma Air Force if and when such a force is created. The clause authorises regulations to be made requiring officers and airmen so attached to obey the orders of any members of the Indian Air Force who are their superiors in rank but they will in any case remain subject to the United Kingdom Air Force Act and will not become subject to the Indian Air Force Act.
