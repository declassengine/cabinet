CONFIDENTIAL.A.C.4QQ.BOARD OF TRADE ADVISORY COUNCIL. STATS OF TRADE - JANUARY 1958.   ,Summary of the reports submitted by Members of the Board of Trade Advisory Council (supplemented in some cases with statistical information from other sources).Overseas Trade.      Imports in January, at  85.0 million, were . 9.2 million  .more than in January 1937:      45,% of this rise was in food and raw materials.      Of the increase of  4.9 million in manufactured goods,&quot;  2.0 million related to iron and steel manufactures,  1.9 million to oils fats and resins, and  0.3 million to non-ferrous metals and manufactures. Exports of   United Kingdom products,  41.2 million,  were  2.1 million more,  and re-exports,  4.8 million, were  0.3 million less.Employment.      The estimated number of insured persons aged 16-64 jn employment (excluding agricultural workers) at 17th January was 11,309,000 - 128,000 less than in December but 87,COO more than in January 1937.      The decline in employment between December and January was most marked in the distributive trades, the textile, tailoring, furniture, engineering,  iron and steel,  tinolate and motor vehicles industries, metal goods manufacture,  dock and harbour service, hotel etc.  service, printing and bookbinding and certain food manufacturing industries.      Employment in the building, public works contracting and stone quarrying industries improved.The total number of unemployed persons on the registers at 17th January - 1,827,607 - was 162,200 more than at 13th December.      The changes in the various divisions were:
London  .............4-45,076   North Vest era...... 4-41,135South Eastern..... 4-21,428   Northern........... - 4,570South western..... 4-11,567   Scotland ........... - 1,272Midlands .......... 4-22,608   Wales .............. 4-13,108North Eastern.....4-13,120Railway Traffic.      In the 4 weeks ended 30th January, railway traffic receipts increased by  477,000 (4.35$) as compared with the  corresponding period of 1937,      The value of passenger traffic increased by 3.45%, merchandise, minerals and livestock by 1.85% and coal, coke etc. &quot;by 9.36$.      These increases were partly due to increased charges which become operative on the 1st October last.Shipping.      The minimum freight rates in all three regulated trades (the homeward   grain trade from the River Plate, Australia and St. Lawrence) are now the market rates, and in the unregulated trades rates fell sharply.      The Chamber of Shipping index number, (on the new basis 1935 - 100), was 2% lower than in December and 17.6?o below January, 1937.      The increase in lsid-up tonnage (75,000 tons net) as compared with 1st October was largely seasonal.Shipbuilding. Mercantile shipbuilding output for1937 was the largest for seven years. Contracts for cargo vessels were still being withheld owing to high costs and to the drop in freight earnings.Banking.      Money was very easy throughout January.Competition for Treasury Bills was acute the rates, d. s. d,varying between 9/lld.46-10/4,-20,        The price of gold remained steady between 139/5d. - 139/9g-d.      The price of silver rose and the market was firm.      The dollar fluctuated between 4.981 - 5.0ll.      The franc weakened considerably owing to labour troubles and a fresh
financial and government crisis, the spot rate falling from 1473/l6 to 155^ j the 3 months forward rate fluctuated &quot;between four and ten francs discount. Financial Conaitjons Abroad.Argentine.      After being steady around 17.00 the peso fell to 18.10 on January 31st, owing to a reduction in the surcharge on imports from certain countries.Belgium.      Partly in sympathy with the weakness of the franc, the efflux of gold was renewed.      Belgas weakened to 29.62, and forward discounts widened at one time, but final quotations improved.France.      There was a heavy adverse balance of trade in 1937 only partly offset &quot;by invisible exports.      The reduction of the Treasury&apos;s borrowing margin,  fresh labour troubles, and the political crisis caused violent fluctuations in the franc,  which closed at 152i-.      Bourse quotations shrank,  and rentes fell further.      Retail prices in 1937 rose by 23%.Germany.      The new 4^-$ internal loan was described as a complete success.      The free Reichsmark rate remained steady, but blocked marks depreciated heavily.Holland.      Government securities improved under the stimulus of the new conversion loan.     Conditions elsewhere on the stock exchange were quiet.     Funds continued abundant.      The florin moved between narrow limits.     Gold reserves have more than doubled since 1936.Japan.   . The adverse balance of trade fell substantially in January.      Increased taxation to meet the cost of war in China was announced.      Shipbuilding output in 1937 was the highest since 1920.NorwayGold and foreign exchange holdings continued to increase.     Industrial output and employment reached record figures in 1937.      Share prices declined early in December hut recovered later.
Sweden.    There was a slight recession in industry during the last few months,      Foreign trade for 1937 showed marked expansion,     Business on the Stock exchange was reserved, and bend quotations coafinled to rise.Switzerland.,    The Swiss franc moved quietly between 21,582 and 21,65.      There was a heavy influx of gold during the French cabinet crisis.U,3.A,    There was a slight improvement in orders in some industries but no forward movement,   the usual seasonal increase taking the form merely of a slowing up of the decline in production.      Some reductions in wages have now occurred. Stock exchange business improved at first but weakened later. The dollar after recovering to ,4*99 towards the middle of the month,    closed at 5,0lf.      Forwards were steady.Coal.      Conditions continued good, but foreign demand was slightly easier.      In the inland trade, mild weather adversely affected domestic consumption.      Industrial demand was still active.      Output for the 4 weeks ended 22nd January, (18.64 million tons; was 292*800 tons more than in the corresponding period of 1937.      This improvement was due mainly to increased home sales, as exports in the first 3 weeks of the year declined by 100,000 tons.      Saleable coal raised in 1937 was 5more than in 1936.Engineering.    The slight recession in activity caused by the decline in civil business continued in January but confidence is maintained by the volume of Government orders on hand and in prospect and no fundamental weakness in the general position has yet appeared.      Exports of machinery amounted to  4.78 in. as compared with  3.52 m.   in January, 1937,    Imports ( 1.99 m.) were  231.,000 more.Motor Industry.    The number of motor vehicles newly registered in December (33,595) was 3,237 less than a year
before;    the decrease in private cars was 2,027.    The production of private cars in ifovember was 27,034 (11.8-&apos;, less than in novemoer 1936; and of commercial vehicles 7,773 (15.9/j less).      Exports of new private cars and chassis in january^ 1938 amounted to 6,412 and of new commercial vehicles and chassis to 1,087 - decreases of 1.2% and 41.1$$ compared with January i937.  ,   Imports of new private cars were 2,526 compared with 1,716 a year ago.jffon-Ferrous Ivietals.    Metal markets improved shar^dy early in January owing to Japanese and Russian demand, but consumers in this and other countries did not respond and at the end of the month prices finished rather lower than at the beginning.      Copper&quot; continued to oe affected by the low level of American buying.      Tinplate operations in the U.S.  fell to 35%.Cotton.    The fall in activity continued in January and a number of mills were temporarily closed.      Sew business was scarce and there were no signs of any immediate improvement.      The daily yarn output index.    (193 5 - 100) was 102 as compared with 112 in December and there was a comparable fall in the manufacturing and finishing sections. Raw cotton prices were fairly steady and spinners&apos; margins were unchanged.      Yarn exports at 10.8 million lbs.  were slightly less than in December and 3 million lbs.  less than in January, 1937.      Exports of piece goods at 138.2 million square yards were 2.9 million square yards less than in December and 22.4 million square yards less than in January, 1937.      The main reason for the decline was the cocoa disturbance in V/est Africa.      Compared with December 1937 exports to India,  Canada, Australia, Denmark and Germany increased while exports to Malaya, Egypt, French West Africa and the Dutch East Indies (all primary producing markets) declined.
Wool.      There was a further decline in machinery activity in December.     Yarn exports decreased during January compared with a year before.      Exports of tops and tissues increased compared with December, but remained less than in January 1937.      Raw wool jirices weakened slightly.Silk and Artificial Silk.      Rayon.      The volume of business from most sections of the weaving trade continued on a diminished scale.      Demand for crepe and hosiery yarns remained quiet,  and trade in staple fibre showed no improvement.      Business in piece goods opened quietly, but the January sales at retail stores exceeded expectations. Yarn exports in January showed a considerable increase over a year before.     Exports of mixed fabrics increased over January 1937, and exports of all rayon fabrics were slightly more in quantity,  though less in value, than a year before. Silk.       Business as a whole was quiet, though the print season opened satisfactorily.      Trade in natural silk other than for lingerie suffered severely from rayon competition.Hides and Leather.      There was a reversal of the upward trend in raw msterials prices which began in December. Hide and leather prices in January were only slightly above the level  at the end of November.      Production generally was in excess of demand,  and prices of the finished product declined in sympathy with raw materials.Chemicals.      There was a marked decline in demand for heavy chemicals and trade in all sections was quieter than in December but the setback is generally regarded as temporary.     Deliveries of chlorine products declined, but remained higher than in January,  1937.      The demand for dyestuffs in the textile trades was still depressed, but foreign sales were maintained except to China.     Exports of fertilisers, showed increases especially to Japan, but demand for coal tar products was quiet.
Pottery. Unemployment in December was higher than a year before. Christmas trade in general earthenwa^t was disappointing and trade in china was about normal. There was a marked decline in demand in the tile section. Home and export sales of sanitary earthenware decreased compared with December 1936, and orders for electrical fittings were substantially less than a year before.Building.      The restoration of a degree of certainty in iron and steel prices and supplies and in cement prices caused some resumption in building programmes, in spite of higher prices and increased wage rates.      There appears to be no   halt in the decline of speculative building of houses for sale, but a small increase in houses built for letting.Retail Trade.      The money value of retail sales in December was 8.3,% higher than in December 1936.      Sales of food and perishables increaced in value by 10.0$ and of non-food merchandise by 6.8$.      Preliminary returns for January indicate a moderate increase, except perhaps in Central London.Canadian Trade.     High-grade bond prices rose during December, and wholesale prices,  while slightly lower than during November, were a few points higher than in December, 1936c      The index of the physical volume of business, after reaching in November the highest level since 1929,   was b% less in December.      Gold shipments were the largest recorded.      Exports of copper, nickel and lead showed declines.      Production of foodstuffs and -output of iron and steel decreased compared with November, but the seasonal recession in newsprint prodiiction was less than normal.     New construction business was greater than in any December since 1931,
Australian Trade.      Wool sold during the first six months of the season realised  6.49 m. (Australian currency) less than in the previous season.      Bales received into store were 2,488,000 compared with 2,376,000 a year before, the quantities sold or shipped being 1,176,000 and 1,376,000 respectively.    Between 1st December to the 25th January, wheat and flour shipments were equivalent to 19,02 m. bushel as compared with 17,04 in the previous year.     Butter export from 1st July to 29th January were 52,000 tons,  compared wit.&quot; 43,000 tons a year before.      Imports of merchandise in December amounted to  11.81 m. (Australian currency) compared with  8.95 m. in December, 1936.South African Trade,      Although full statistics are not yet available, there was clearly a striking expansion in trade during 1937.      Imports in November were 21.6$, and exports (excluding gold) 8.7$ higher than a year before. In December, imports and exports (excluding gold) increased in value by 11,3$ and 14.1$ respectively compared with December, 1936.      There were smaller exports of diamonds, wool, hides and skins, and wattle bark and extracts, while shipments of maize, fruit,  sugar and copper increased. Total exports for 1937 rose by 9.8%, imports by 19.9&amp;.      The visible export surplus ( 22,0 million) was  6.0 million less than in 1936.Indian Trade.      In view of the separation of Burma from India,  trade figures for the year 1937 cannot be strictly compared with those for earlier years, but after due allowance is made for the change in territory, it would appear that trade in the year 1937 was considerably higher than in 1936,     The balance of trade continued to be in favour of India.
