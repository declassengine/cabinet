secret  CP. 67 (58)Copy No,.. J.U    -j    o    o    cabinet.Austria and Czechoslovakia.In accordance with the Conclusions of the Cabinet at the last meeting (Cabinet 12 (58) Conclusion (d)) I circulate herewith for the information of my colleagues a paper on the 3ritish attitude towards Austria and Czechoslovakia and the League aspect of recent events.Three conclusions seem to emerge:-(1)   That we had no commitments to take action vis-a-vis Austria and that we have no such commitments vis-a-vis Czechoslovakia other than the general obligations of the Covenant.(2)   Yife were pledged to consultation in the case of Austria and have discharged that obligation fully with the French Government, and have made an approach to the Italian Government, from whom we have, however, received no formal indication of their views.(5)   We await information as to the French attitude on the question of an approach to the League;   if they evince a strong desire that such an approach should be made, I should hope to be able to persuade them to accept our view that such a course is undesirable.H.15th March, 1958,
BRITISH ATTITUDE TOWARDS AUSTRIA AND CZECHOSLOVAKIA AMD LEAGUE ASPECT OF RECENT EVENTS.Attitude towards Austria and Czechoslovakia0Probably the statement-which most nearly approaches to a specific coiMiitment in respect of Austria, subscribed to by His Majesty&apos;s Government, is contained in the tripartite com:runicpi6 issued by the French, Italian and United Kingdom Governments on the 17th February 1934-e     That coiiMuniqu6 stated that the three Governments &quot;take a common view as to the necessity of maintaining Austria&apos;s independence and integrity in accordance with the relevant treaties5&apos;0     (See Annex 1) 0(The antecedents of the 1954- declaration were as follows: Evidence of Nazi terrorism had accumulated in Vienna and Dr. Dollfuss informed the German Government of this evidence, adding that lie would appeal to the League if he did not receive a satisfactory explanation.     The reply was unsatisfactory and before appealing to the League Dr. Dollfuss approached the three Governments;   on the initiative of the Italian Government the joint statement was issued, and as a result the Austrian Govern-nient decided not to appeal to the Lea.gue.     Meanwhile the Austrian Government was engaged in putting down the Socialist revolt in Vienna)0The declaration of February 1954 was reaffirmed by the three Governments in September 1954 and also six months later at the Stresa Conferenceo     A resolution of that Conference dated the 14th April 1955, after confirming the 1954 declaration, made provision for the three Governments to consult together as to &quot;the measures to be taken in the case of threats to the integrity and independence of Austria.&quot;     (Annex 2,)On November 20th, 1936 the then Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Eden) made an important pronouncement atLeamington
Leamington regarding the foreign commitments of His Majesty&apos;s Government.    He said that our arms would never he used in a war of aggressicno     After citing the conditions in which those arms might and would &quot;be used, he added that &quot;our armaments may he used in bringing help to a victim of aggression in any case where, in our judgment, it would be proper under the provisions of the Covenant to do so.!!     No specific &quot;mention was made in this speech of Austria or Central Europe.     (Annex 50)However, when Mr.. Eden quoted this speech on June 24th, 1937 in the House of Commons he prefaced his words with a direct reference to ;:the general lines of our foreign policy towards Central Europe&quot;.     (Annex 4.)More latterly questions have been answered in the House of Commons on the subject of Austria, in the course of which, while we have referred back to the 1954 communique and the Stresa resolution, we have never gone beyond either.     We have however pointed out that we have been, and still are, prepared for the consultation fore-shadowed in the Stresa resolution. (See in particular Parliamentary questions of February 16th and February 17th 195S - Annex 5 and 6).     The only consultation which has taken place, however, has been between His Majesty&apos;s Government and the French Government.The latest and most succinct statement of our commitments towards Austria and Czechoslovakia is contained in the answer given on February 21st last by the Chancellor of the Exchequer to a question by Miss V/ilkinson in which he said that &quot;The obligations of His Majesty1 s Government towards Austria and Czechoslovakia are those which every Member of the League of Nations assumes towards all its fellow Members.     Apart from these, His Majesty&apos;s Government have given no special guarantees towards either count ry1&apos;.     (Annex 7).As
As regards Czechoslovakia, v/e have never gone beyond the Chancellor&apos;s reply.     A statement of Lord Plymouth in the House of Lords on February 16th made it clear that the special treaty relations existing between France and Czechoslovakia did not involve His Majesty&apos;s Government in any extra commitment in regard to Czechoslovakia.     (Annex 8).     It should perhaps be added that on the following day Mr. Eden assured the House that &quot;this country has always had the friendliest feelings towards the Czechoslovakia nation, and is fully aware of the treaties which bind Czechoslovakia to other Powers&quot;.     (Annex 8).The League Aspect.Under Article 80 of the Treaty of Versailles Germany acknowledged and undertook to respect the independence of Austria.     Under Article 88 of the Treaty of St. Germain Austria undertook, in the absence of the consent of the Council of the League, to abstain from any act which might directly or indirectly or by any means whatever compromise her independence. If, as a result of recent events in Central Europe, Austria&apos;s independence has been compromised, both Germany and Austria have violated the relevant provisions of the Peace Treaties.In both the above-mentioned articles it is stated that the independence of Austria would be inalienable except with the consent of the Council of the League.     In these circumstances, if they so desire, it would be for the parties to the Peace Treaties to take any action that-might be open to them on account of these violations.i^uite apart from the above-mentioned provisions of the Peace Treaty, the Austrian question could be brought before the League in virtue of the provisions of the Covenant.     Austria herself has made no attempt to bring the matter before the Leagueunder
under Article 17, as it is open to her to do (Dispute with non-Member State).     It would, however, be open to any Member of the League to bring the question before the League either under Article 3, which states that the Assembly &quot;may deal at its meetings with any matter within the sphere of action of the League or affecting the peace of the world&quot;;   or under Article 11, which says:   &quot;It is also declared to be the friendly right of each Member of the League to bring to the attention of the Assembly or of the Council any circumstance whatever affecting international relations which threatens to disturb international peace or the good understanding between nations upon which peace depends&quot;.The practical position is that unless the Council (which is very unlikely) were unanimously to give its consent to the alienation of Austria&apos;s independence - and this would be a humiliating step to take in present circumstances - any discussion of the Austrian question at the Council would merely result in acute embarrassment to all concerned and be of no practical utility.     For it should be remembered that the dis-cussion would take place certainly in the absence of a representative of Germany and most probably in the absence of a representative of Austria.In this connexion a telegram sent to Paris on March 12th puts forward the practical objections we, on our side, see to any submission of this question to the Council.     (Annex 9).March 13 th, 1938..ANNEX&apos; 1.
ANNEX I 5.&quot;The Austrian Government has enquired of the Governments of France, Great Britain and Italy as to their attitude with regard to the dossier which it has prepared with a view to establishing Germany&apos;s inter-ference in the internal affairs of Austria and communi-cated to them.&quot;The conversations which have taken place, on this subject have shown that they take a common view as to the necessity of maintaining Austria&apos;s independen&amp;e and integrity in accordance with the relevant treaties&quot;. (Communique issued &quot;by French, Italian and United Kingdom Governments, 17th February 1934).annex 2.
ANF3X 2.&quot;The Representatives of the three Governments examined afresh the Austrian situation.They confirmed the Anglo-Franco-Italian declarations of the 17th February and the 27th September, 1954, in which the three Governments recognised that the necessity of maintaining the independence and integrity of Austria would continue to inspire their common policy.&quot;Referring to the Franco-Italian protocol of the 7th January, 1955, and to the Anglo-French declarations of the 5rd February, 1955, in which the decision was re-affirmed to consult together as to the measures to be taken in the case of threats to the integrity and in-dependence of Austria., they agreed to recommend that Representatives of all the Governments enumerated in the protocol of Rome should meet at a very early date with a view to concluding the Central European Agreement&quot;. (Stresa, 14th Apri1 1955).^WEX 5
ANNEX 5.-------- 7.Extract from Speech by Mr. Eden at Leamington, November 20th, 1956.&quot;But, it may be asked, for what purpose will these arms be used?     Let me once again make the position in this respect perfectly clear.     These arms will never be used in a war of aggression.     They will never be used for a purpose inconsistent with the Covenant of the League or the Pact of Paris.     They may, and if the occasion arose they would, be used in our own defence and in defence of the territories of the British Commonwealth of Nations.     They may, and if the occasion arose they would, be used in the defence of France and Belgium against unprovoked aggression in accordance with our existing ob-ligations.     They may, and, if a new Western European settlement can be reached, they would, be used in defence of Germany were she the victim of unprovoked aggression by any of the other signatories of such a settlement. Those, together with our Treaty of Alliance with Iraq and our projected treaty with Egypt, are our definite obligations.     In addition, our armaments may be used in bringing help to a victim of aggression in any case where, in our judgment, it would be proper under the provisions of the Covenant to do so.     I use the word &quot;may&quot; deliberate-ly, since in such an instance there is no automatic ob-li gat ion to take military action.     It is, moreover, right-that this should be so, for nations cannot be expected to incur automatic military obligations save for areas where their vital interests are concerned.&quot;.   ANNEX 4.
Mr. Eden, in the House of Commons - June 25th, 1957.An honourable Member has complained that the general lines our foreign policy towards Central Europe were not clear.    I do not think that that accusation can be fairly levelled.   I hesitate to re-quote words of mine which the Prime Minister . has already quoted, but none the less, as they state our position, I would venture to do so.   The charge so often made against us is that we  ire rearming.   Most people think that that is right.   Even lion. Members who&quot; voted against us are beginning to think that that is right.    Certainly their friends in Europe are quite sure that it is right.    But in any event, the charge goes on.    &quot;You are rearming, but you have no other policy whatever.    You have no other policy as to what your arms are going to be used for&quot;.    I do not admit that that is true.    I will re-quote my words:&quot;Our arms will never be used in a war of aggression. They will never be used for a purpose inconsistent with the Covenant of the League or the Pact of Paris.   They could, and if the occasion arose they would, be used in our defence, and in defence of the British Commonwealth of Nations,   They may, and if the occasion arose they would, be used in defence of France and Belgium against unprovoked aggression, in accordance with our existing obligations&quot;,There is no dispute about that, nor that Germany will be included in that guarantee if Germany were included in a treaty of that character.In addition, our armaments may be used in bringing help to
ANNEX 5cto a victim of aggression in any case where, in our judgment, it would he proper under the provisions of the Covenant to do so.   I use the word &quot;may1 deliberately since in such an instance there is no automatic obligation to take military action.I submit that that is a definition which is generally accepted by this country and generally understood by the nations of Europe11.
Parliamentary Question, February 16th, 1956.Mo B2LLENGSR   asked the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs whether, in view of the fact that the integrity and independence of Austria are declared objects of British policy, he has any official information concerning the weekend conversations between the Austrian and German Chancellors;   and, if not, will he ask to be informed of the purport of those conversations?   -MR, EDEN:   Yes, Sir.   -I understand that the working of the Austro-German Agreement of July, 1956, has for some time past been under consideration by the German and Austrian Governments,   A meeting was eventually held at Berchtesgaden oh Saturday last between the Austrian and German Chancellors, and, as a result, a new agreement has been reached between the Austrian and German Governments,   This new agreement has not yet been published, but a communique was issued early this morning outlining what passed: and the reorganisation of the Austrian Government has been announced in accordance, so I understand, with the undertakings reached at Berchtesgaden.   There is reason to believe that other provisions of the agreement contain undertakings by both Governments on a variety of subjects, but until the actual text of the agreement is published I am not in a position to make any further statement.   His Majesty s Government are meanwhile closely following developments,MR. BBLLENGKR.:   While not seeking to press the right hon. Gentleman at the moment, may I ask him whether he would give an assurance that the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government in relationto
to the integrity and independence of Austria remains the same as that stated by him on a previous occasion in this House?MR. EDEN: My recollection is that what I said then was that His Majesty1 s Government desired in Central Europe, as elsewhere, peace and good understanding.    That certainly is our policy.MR. A HENDERSON:   Will His Majesty&apos;s Government stand by the joint declaration of February, 1954, to the effect that they reaffirmed the interest of this country in the integrity and independence of Austria?MR. EDEN:   I take it that the hon. Member is referring to the Stresa Declaration.   That is quite true.   Of course, that was a declaration by three Governments - Britain, France and Italy. Italy has not, as yet, consulted His Majesty&apos;s Government on the matter.ANNEX 6.
Parliamentary Question, February 17th, 1958.MR. ATTLEE (by Private Notice) asked the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs whether he has any further statement to make regarding the situation in Austria?THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS (MR. EDEN): Yes, Sir,     I have received certain information in regard to the new Austro-German Agreement.     As, however, the terms of this Agreement have not yet been made public by the parties to it, I am unable at this moment to give any detailed infor-mation to the House.     I hope, however, to be in a position to make a statement at an early date, perhaps to-morrow.     In the meanwhile, in view of statements in the Press, I should perhaps add that His Majesty&apos;s Minister in Vienna was informed of the proposed meeting between the Austrian Chancellor and Herr Hitler on 11th February;    that is to say, on the eve of the meeting itself.     The views or advice of Mis Majesty&apos;s Government were not invited in connexion with that meeting. While, at the present moment, I am not in a position to esti-mate the exact effect of this Agreement, His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment are following developments with close attention, and His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Berlin has already been instructed to indicate to the German Government the interest which His Majesty&apos;s Government take, and have always taken, in the Austrian.question.MR. ATTLEE:    Can the right hon. Gentleman make more clear the reply which he gave to a question on this subject yester-day, relative to the attitude of His Majesty&apos;s Government tofcl&quot;16     o o o e
the integrity and independence of Austria, as based oa the Declaration of 1954?MR. EDEN:   Yes, Sir.     That Declaration as the House will recollect, was reaffirmed by the Stresa Conference, where machinery was agreed upon for consultation,     Perhaps I should make it clear to the House that, so far as His Majesty&apos;s Government are concerned, they have been, and are still, pre-pared for such consultation.MR. ATTLEE:   In view of the methods which have been apparently employed with regard to Austria, can the right her.. Gentleman state the attitude of His Majesty&apos;s Government with regard to the position of Czechoslovakia?MR. EDEN:    I think that it is perhaps desirable that I should have notice of that;   but, straightaway, I would like to assure the House that this country has always had the friendliest feelings towards the Czechoslovakia!! nation, and is fully aware of the treaties which bind Czechoslovakia to other Powers.MR. CHURCHILL:   Apart from any national commitments or expressions which may have been used, has not the League of Nations at Geneva certain duties and responsibilities lying upon it in respect of the independence and integrity of Austria?MR. EDEN:    Yes, Sir.     My right hon. Friend is perfectly justified in his conclusion,,     At the same time, it is our view, in view of the particular circumstances of the Stresa Declaration, that we are willing to act with others as providedfOX*     o   o   o  0
ANNEX 7for in that declaration, &quot;but we do not think it lies with us to take the initiative.MR. MAND.ER:   Did the Austrian Government at any stage in the events of the last few days ask the British Government what measures of support, if any, would be granted to them if they resisted?MR. EDEN:   I thought my answer made that quite clear. No such suggestion was ever made to His Majesty&apos;s Government,,MR. BBLLENGER:   In view of the declared policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government towards Austria, is the right hon. Gentle-man in consultation with any of the other signatories to the Stresa agreement?mr. EDEN:   Yes, Sir.     I am in consultation with the French Government-.
PARE IAMENTARY QUESTION. February 81st, 1053,MISS WILKINSON asked the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs how many times Britain has guaranteed the independence of Austria since the Armistice;    and how many assurances that Britain will assist in the maintenance of the independence of Czechoslovakia have been given to that State since the same date?SIR J, SIMON:     The obligations of Mis Majesty&apos;s Government towards Austria and Czechoslovakia are those which every member of the League of Nations assumes towards all its fellow members. Apart from these, His Majesty&apos;s Government have given no special guarantees towards either country.EISS WILKINSON:   Do I understand from the right honourable Gentleman that if we give general guarantees we do not expect to keep our word?SIR J, SIMON:     1 do not know to what general guarantees the honourable Member is referring.MISS WILKINSON:     Does the right honourable Gentleman know what the general guarantees mean in the answer which he has given us?MR. VYVYAN ADAMS.: Have the Government any evidence to confirm the report that the German Government have asked for the withdrawal of Austria from the League of Nations?ANNEX 8.
lb.LORD PLYMOUTH, in the House of Lords, February 16th, 1958:The noble Lord has particularly stressed the dangers which in his view arise out of our commitments to France with particular regard to the Franco-Soviet Pact and France&apos;s commitments to Czechoslovakia.   He did in fact, as was pointed out by the noble Viscount opposite (Viscount Cecil cf Chelwood), argue in favour of a policy of isolation.     ,/ith all respect to him I must repeat what I have already said on a number of occasions - namely, that the view of His Majesty&apos;s Government is that such a policy is quite impracticable in -these days,    Apart from the principles involved, we believe it to be froM the purely material point of view or practical point of view an impossible thing.     As the noble Lord himself v/ill admit, this country throughout its history has found it impossible to disinterest itself from events which take place on the part of the Continent opposite our own shores, and to suggest that we should do so now would, to my mind, not only be a complete revolution in policy but would be quite unsound and illogical as well.   The noble Lord has argued that the invention of aircraft has made a very great difference;   in fact, has made the whole difference.   I quite honestly fail to follow his line of -argument when he says that the presence of aircraft has made it less objectionable for us to have a potential enemy outside our shores.     Indeed, I should have thought on the other hand that it was a state of affairs which supported the view that is held by His Majesty1s Government in this matter, that it is impossible for them to dissociate themselves from what occurs on the Continent opposite our own shores.I would like to point out that our commitments to France and to Belgium arise out of the Treaty of Locarno, supplemented as itwas
was by the proposals of March, 1930, after the reoccupation of the Rhineland.   The obligations that we undertook were in general terms to go to the immediate assistance of France and Belgium in the event of unprovoked aggression by Germany.   It should be remembered that the Treaty of Locarno was not an alliance but a treaty of non-aggression and guarantee concluded within the framework of the Covenant.   That guarantee still has this character.   Since then an assurance, as your Lordships are aware, was given by the French Foreign Secretary to the effect that all French forces would be immediately used in defence of this country against unprovoked aggression.   But what I wanted specially to point out to the House was that the only new element in fact since the time of the Treaty of Locarno was the Franco-Soviet Pact.   As a matter of fact the Franco-Czechoslovakian Treaty was part of the whole Locarno settlement, and the Franco-Polish Treaty was as well.   Therefore the only new element - the noble Marquess, Lord Lothian, shakes his head, but I am led to understand that that is so.The MARQUESS OF LOTHIAN:   I do not think any British Government ever took cognisance of any Frarico-Ozechoslovakian military alliance.     It never entered into the discussions I think,- The J5ARL OF PLYMOUTH:     I will look into that point; perhaps I have been misled on the mat-te-r-.-^,However that may be it seems to me that the greatest emphasis has been laid upon the Franco-Soviet Pact.     I must repeat that His Majesty&apos;s Government hold that the existence of that Pact (Franco-Soviet Pact) has not in any way increased our legal obligations towards France.   The noble Lord referred to a question put in the House of Commons in February of last year when Mr. George Lambert, who asked whether any commitment existed whereby under the Franco-Russian PactGreat   .
Great Britain could be involved in a European war.   That question was answered by viscount Cranborne, who said:&quot;The answer to the first part of the question is:  &apos;Ho, Sir.&apos;     As regards the second part of the question, I thin)-: the French and Soviet Governments are fully aware of the position.&quot; I do not think that answer can be swept away as if it had no significance whatsoever.     I may say that the same thing is true of the French Treaty-with Czechoslovakia as well.    I think that it puts the position as clearly as it could be put in present circumstances.   But the real point is this, that if war broke out and France became involved in hostilities, it is perfectly obvious that the action which His Majesty&apos;s Government would take would have to depend on the circumstances of the case in which those hostilities had arisen.annex 9...... .
IMTORfArM1.We shall almost certainly be asked whether in present circumstances we are taking any steps to employ machinery of League of Nations*In the view of His Majesty&apos;s Government, such procedur would be of no practical advantage in redressing present situation, and we fear that only result would be to expose League to open humiliation.     Moreover to place League in this position now must inevitably prejudice its eventualre const i tut i on..Please inform French Government that this is the feeling of His Majesty&apos;s government     We should be glad to know their views.annex 9oCode telegram to Sir E. Phipps (Paris)Foreign Office, 12th March, 1933,   8,45 p.mE No. 68   (R).
