THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   February 1938.SECEET. Copy No.CP. 46 (38).CABINET.CONTROL OF IMMIGRATION INTO PALESTINE.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.MY colleagues will recall that in paragraph 6 of the Statement of Policy issued as a White Paper in July last* it was laid down that a total Jewish immi-gration into Palestine in all categories of 8,000 persons should be permitted for the eight months&apos; period August 1937 to March 1938, provided that the economic absorptive capacity of the country was not exceeded. An early decision is now required as to the policy to be adopted when the present special restriction expires on the 31st March.2. It will be convenient in the first place to recapitulate the history of this question and the policy which has been followed by His Majesty&apos;s Government since the Mandate for Palestine was issued. The following articles of the Mandate are relevant: Article 2.The Mandatory shall be responsible for placing the country under such political, administrative and economic conditions as will secure the estab-lishment of the Jezvish national home.....Article 6.The Administration of Palestine, while ensuring that the rights and position of other sections of the population are not prejudiced, shall facilitate Jeivish immigration under suitable conditions.....Article 15..... No person shall be excluded from Palestine on the sole ground of his religious belief.3. While it is clear that the relevant articles of the Mandate do not require that economic considerations alone should be taken into account in the control of immigration into Palestine, His Majesty&apos;s Government have in practice adopted &quot;economic absorptive capacity&quot; as the sole criterion for determining the rate of immigration, and this principle was made explicit in paragraphs 4 (5) and 27 of the Statement of Policy of October 1930,t and in paragraph 15 of Mr. Ramsay MacDonald&apos;s letter to Dr. Weizmann of the 13th February, 19314 &quot;The con-siderations relevant to the limits of absorptive capacity are purely economic considerations.&quot; Copies of these two papers were laid before the Permanent Mandates Commission at their Twentieth Session in June 1931 and in their Report on the work of the Session the Commission evinced no desire to criticise the declared policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government.* Cmd. 5513. f Cmd. 3692[16755]% Colonial Office Paper Middle East No. 39.B
4. Mr. Churchill&apos;s Statement of Policy of the 3rd June, 1922,* which was communicated to the Permanent Mandates Commission at the time when the draft Mandate for Palestine was under consideration, contained the following passage : &quot; For the fulfilment of this policy (viz., the obligation to facilitate the establishment of a Jewish National Home in Palestine) it is necessary that the Jewish community in Palestine should be able to increase its numbers by immigration. This immigration cannot be so great in volume as to exceed whatever may be the economic capacity of the country at the time to absorb new arrivals.&quot;Taken literally, this passage appears to mean that while immigration might be restricted below economic capacity, it must in no case exceed that limit; but however that may be, there is no doubt that successive British Governments since the issue of the Mandate have been guided by economic considerations alone in controlling immigration into Palestine.5. Until special restrictions were introduced as a temporary measure last year, the Immigration Ordinance of Palestine, which was drafted in close consultation with the Jewish Agency, was based strictly on the principle that the rate of immigration was to be determined solely by economic absorptive capacity. In accordance with this principle, the Ordinance provides for numerical limitation in the case of only one category of immigrants, namely, labour immigrants, whose admission is regulated under the Ordinance by means of quotas fixed half-yearly by the High Commissioner after consideration of the number of labour vacancies, the extent of unemployment and other relevant facts. The other main categories, namely, persons of independent means (commonly called &quot; capitalists &quot;), dependants and students, if they comply with the conditions laid down in the Ordinance, have been admitted without numerical restriction; and it is difficult to see how such restriction could be justified on economic grounds in the case of (a) persons who have at their free disposal a sum of at least  1,000, whichis regarded as adequate to render them self-supporting;(b) dependants, who are only admitted if their relations in Palestine are willing and able to support them; or(c) students, who are only allowed to enter if assurances are given (i) that they will be admitted to an educational institution, and (ii) that they will be maintained until they are able to support themselves.6. It will be recalled that the Royal Commission in Chapter X of their Report (paragraphs 73-77 and 95-98) came to the conclusion that &quot; the principle of economic absorptive capacity, meaning that considerations of economic capacity and these alone should determine immigration, is at the present time inadequate and ignores factors in the situation which wise statesmanship cannot disregard. Political and psychological factors should be taken into account,&quot; and recommended that His Majesty&apos;s Government &quot; should lay down a &apos; political high level &apos; of Jewish immigration to cover Jewish immigration of all categories. This high level should be fixed for the next five years at 12,000 per annum, and in no circumstances during that period should more than that number be allowed into the country in one year. The political maximum having been fixed, the High Commissioner should receive insti-uctions to the effect that he may &quot;use his discretion to admit immigrants up to the maximum figure, but subject always to the economic absorptive capacity of the country.&quot;7. But this recommendation was based on the assumption of the continuance of the existing Mandate, and the Royal Commission describe it as merely a palliative, that is to say, it would&apos; not in their opinion remove the &apos;&apos; grievance &apos;&apos; of the Arabs in the matter or V prevent its recurrence.&quot; In Part II of the Report they recommend an alternative method by which definite limits might be set to the expansion of the Jewish National Home, namely, partition, which imposes a territorial instead of a numerical limitation, and this alternative has been, -accepted by His Majesty&apos;s Government as the &quot; best and most hopeful solution.&quot;
8. In Chapter XXII (paragraphs 48-49) of.their Report the Commission deal with the transition period &quot; in the immediate future if it should be agreed to terminate the Mandate and establish a Treaty System on a basis of Partition.&apos;y For this period they propose that &quot;Instead of the &apos; political high level&apos; .... there should be a territorial restriction on Jewish immigration. No Jewish immigration into the Arab area should be permitted .... the volume of Jewish immigration should be determined by the economic absorptive capacity of Palestine less the Arab area.&quot;The Commission have not, however, made any recommendation with regard to the control of immigration during the immediate interim period between the issue of the Statement of Policy last July and a final decision with regard to partition. As the prospective boundaries of the Arab and Jewish areas cannot now be predicted and must i^remain quite uncertain until a decision has been taken on the Report of the &quot;Technical&quot; Commission, it is impossible to adopt the Commission^ recommendation for the &quot; transition period.&quot;9. It will be remembered that in laying down an overriding limit of 8,000 immigrants for the eight months August 1937 to March 1938, in the Statement of Policy of July, 1937,* care was taken to avoid the implication that the Govern-ment had adopted the Royal Commission^ proposal for a &quot; political high level,&quot; and, if the principle of an &quot; over-riding maximum &quot; is to be retained after the 31st March, I should be strongly averse from relating the decision to that recom-mendation of the Royal Commission. The Commission^ recommendation of a &quot; political high level &quot; was, as already noted, definitely based on the assumption of the continuance of the existing Mandate, and any suggestion that we had already adopted it would be seized upon inevitably by both Jews and Arabs as yet another indication that the Government had changed its mind on the question of partition.10. Sir Arthur Wauchope, with whom I have been in close consultation, regards the maintenance of the principle of the present temporary restriction as a reassurance of Arab opinion not only within Palestine, but beyond its frontiers. He takes the view that the Arabs would regard the abandonment of this form of restriction as the result of Jewish persuasion and that such a step would not stimulate Arab opinion in the direction of partition, but rather in the direction of continued resistance, covert and overt, to the mandatory rule and the policy of a Jewish National Home or Jewish State.It should, however, be borne in mind that the recent imposition of an arbitrary quota of 8,000 immigrants for eight months has evoked no appreciative comment in Arab circles, and that there is so far no indication that any concession short of surrender to the impossible demand for the complete prohibition of Jewish immigration will have any effect on Arab opinion.11. The fundamental justification for a temporary and arbitrary restriction of immigration lies in the fact that the declared object of our policy is a scheme of partition under which Jewish immigration would be confined to a limited area. During the interim period of preparatory investigation it is obviously impossible to allow immigration to be determined by the economic absorptive capacity of the whole country.Recent speeches by Dr. Weizmann and other leading Jews foreshadow a forward policy in the matter of immigration. In a despatch dated the 26th January, our Ambassador at Washington reported the proceedings of &apos;&apos; The National Conference of Palestine,&quot; convened under the auspices of the United Palestine Appeal and other American-Jewish bodies which are attempting to raise funds for the settlement of Jewish refugees. This conference met at Washington on the 22nd January and adopted a resolution appealing to American Jewry to raise $4,500,000 in 1938 for a large scale Jewish colonisation programme in Palestine to assist refugees from Roumania, Poland and Germany. The conference also adopted a resolution calling upon His Majesty&apos;s Government to carry out the Palestine Mandate and the Balfour Declaration, and on the Colonial Office to permit immigration as determined by the economic capacity of* Cmd. 5513.[16755] b 2
Palestine and the necessities caused by increasing persecution in anti-Semitic European countries.I am advised that, while any estimate must be mere guesswork, immigration might increase to the rate of 2,000 a month during the present year and 3,000 a month next year if special restrictions were removed altogether. There is a serious risk that a reversion to the criterion of economic absorptive capacity would provide the Jews with an incentive to accelerate immigration during the interim period, thus gravely complicating the work of the new Commission and prejudicing the prospects of securing a workable scheme of partition.12. I have therefore come to the conclusion, which is accepted by Sir Arthur Wauchope, that the principle of restriction should be maintained for a further period of twelve months after the 31st March. This principle is embodied in a new Section (5 A) which was added to -the Immigration Ordinance last November, and a copy of which is appended to this memorandum (Appendix I).I am advised that the last paragraph of the new section allows of only one extension of the validity of Section 5 A; that is to say, that if more than one period of extension is desired an amending Ordinance will be necessary. It is for this reason that I have suggested an extension of the validity of the new section for as long a period as twelve months. It will be noticed that the new section is permissive, and I would propose that in the first instance the power of prescription should be exercised for a period of six months only from April to September 1938, leaving open for later consideration the procedure to be adopted after that date.   Sir Arthur Wauchope concurs.13. There is, however, no doubt that a decision to maintain the existing temporary restrictions will be bitterly opposed by the Jews, and that this opposition will meet with strong support in the House of Commons and at Geneva when the affairs of Palestine come under discussion next June before the Permanent Mandates Commission. The new section of the Immigration Ordinance has already been fiercely criticised by the Jews and their supporters on the ground that any departure from the principle of regulating immigration by the sole criterion of economic absorptive capacity (a) is inconsistent with the Mandate;(b) is contrary to the declared policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government, whichhas received the approval of the League of Nations; and(c) was declared to be contrary to the Mandate in the letter which lord Hailsham and Sir John Simon wrote to The Times on the 2nd November, 1930.14.   I suggest the following answers to these criticisms : (a) Examination of the Mandate shows that there is not a single article which requires the Mandatory Power or the Administration of Palestine to regulate immigration by the principle of economic absorptive capacity alone. There is no reference to that principle in the Mandate itself.(b) It is true that the temporary introduction last year of an overridingmaximum represents a departure from declared and consistent policy, but such a departure is entirely within the competence of the Mandatory Power, and any suggestion that a change of policy involving no departure from the provisions of the Mandate requires the prior approval of the Council of the League of Nations could, in my opinion, be resisted.When I attended as Accredited Representative the Thirty-Second Session of the Permanent Mandates Commission, the Chairman confronted me with the Jewish argument that it would be contrary to the Mandate to determine the rate of Jewish immigration into Palestine by any other criterion than the economic absorptive capacity of the country, and I dealt fully with this contention in my reply.In their Report the Permanent Mandates Commission commented as follows on the question of immigration : &quot; In connection with the examination of the Annual Report for 1936, the Commission notes the mandatory Power&apos;s decision to reduce Jewish immigration temporarily as from the 1st August, 1937, to
8,000 persons for the next eight months. The Commission does not question that the mandatory Power, responsible as it is for mainten-ance of order in the territory, may on occasion find it advisable to take such a step, and is competent to do so, as an exceptional and provisional measure; it feels, however, bound to draw attention to this departure from the principle sanctioned by the League Council that immigration is to be proportionate to the country&apos;s economic absorptive capacity.&quot;The resolution of the League Council approving the Report of the Permanent Mandates Commission included the following words in its preamble: &apos;&apos; Recalling the assurances given in that connection by the Repre-sentative of the United Kingdom on the subject of immigration.&quot;Mr. Eden&apos;s words were : &quot; The Permanent Mandates Commission have drawn attention to the reduction of Jewish immigration to a total of 8,000 persons in the next eight months. That, as the Commission recognised, is a purely temporary measure designed to meet temporary and excep-tional conditions. If, as they say, it is a departure from the principle sanctioned by the Council on a former occasion, my colleagues will, I am sure, appreciate the special circumstances in which this decision has been taken. What is to happen when the period of eight months is over, that is to say, after the 31st March, 1938, must necessarily depend upon the progress made in the meanwhile with the partition scheme. If the scheme has by that time reached a stage of provisional acceptance, the whole question of immigration as affecting both the Arab and the Jewish areas will clearly have to be considered on a fresh basis.&quot;It is clear that, so far as last year&apos;s proceedings at Geneva are concerned, we are under no obligation or commitment to revert to the status quo after the 31st March next.(c) Reference to the letter which Lord Hailsham and Sir John Simon wrote to The Times on the 2nd November, 1930, is quite irrelevant. At that time the Statement of Policy of 1930* had been attacked on the ground, inter alia, that it was alleged to imply that no further Jewish immigration would be permitted so long as there was a single Arab unemployed. The letter to The Times was based on this interpretation of the Statement of Policy and drew the obvious conclusion that if the complete stispension of Jewish immigration were contemplated, the Statement of Policy contravened the provisions of Article 6 of the&apos; Mandate. The letter was not concerned with the question whether the principle of economic absorptive capacity was enshrined in the Mandate and expressed no opinion on that point.In his reply in The Times of the 6th November, 1930, Lord Pass-field explained that the White Paper had been misinterpreted and that there was no intention of suspending Jewish immigration until every Arab in the country had secured employment. But the resulting controversy led to the formal reaffirmation of the principle of economic absorptive capacity in the MacDonald letter which was communicated to and taken note of by the Council of the League.15. If, as I recommend, the validity of Section 5a of the Immigration Ordinance is extended for a further period of twelve months, that decision should, I think, be defended on the ground mentioned in paragraph 11 above. Though the economic position of Palestine is at present far from satisfactory, I could not attempt to defend the decision solely on economic grounds, since it would be difficult to i&apos;efute the contention that, if economic considerations alone are relevant, the control imposed by the Immigration Ordinance (without Section 5a) has not in its main principles been proved inadequate. At the same time, I see no reason why reference should not be made to the present difficulties
of the economic situation in general justification of a cautious policy in the matter of the control of immigration.For the reasons given in paragraph 9 above, I would certainly not defend the decision by reference to the recommendation in Part II of the Report of the Royal Commission for the imposition of a &quot; political high level,&quot; which might and would be interpreted as involving the abandonment of the idea of partition and a return to a policy of carrying on indefinitely with the existing Mandate.With a view to mitigating Jewish hostility towards the maintenance of the form of existing temporary restriction for a further period of twelve months, I should like to announce simultaneously that it is the intention of His Majesty&apos;s Government, as soon as the boundaries of the various areas have been defined, and so long as the existing Mandate continues in operation, temporarily to regulate the admission of Jewish immigrants by the economic absorptive capacity of Palestine less the Arab area, as recommended by the Royal Commission.16. If this recommendation is approved, the next question for consideration is the specific application in respect of the six months&apos; period April to September 1938 of the restrictive powers conferred by Section 5a of the Immigration Ordinance. In this connection, again, for the reasons given in paragraph 9 above, I should like to avoid the retention of the present overriding maximum allowing an average immigration rate of 1.000 a month, which is equivalent to the &quot; political high level &quot; of 12,000 a year. If we are to fix an all-inclusive figure for the six months, I consider that it should be slightly more than 6,000, but I should prefer to diminish the element of arbitrariness as far as possible by discriminating explicitly between the various categories of immigrants, that is to say, labour immigrants, students, capitalists and dependants, and by imposing an arbitrary quota in respect of capitalists and labour immigrants alone.Recommendation.17. From the mass of Jewish propaganda which has been sent to me by Jewish bodies in many parts of this country and has come to my notice in the press and through correspondence, it is possible to single out two main arguments which are likely to carry weight with the general public at home and abroad, and in particular with Jewish supporters in the House of Commons. The first argument is that the economic situation, so far from justifying a restriction of immigration, demands its encouragement. Past experience has shown that the entry of immigrants of the capitalist class leads almost immediately to an increased demand for labour, and it will be contended with some force that the best remedy for existing Jewish unemployment lies in the generous admission of &apos;&apos; capitalist &apos;&apos; immigrants.The second argument is that the present system of restriction by means of an overriding maximum covering all categories of immigrants compels many immigrants to leave behind their wives and children, whose admission is barred by the quota, thereby creating cases of real hardship.The debating case for the maintenance of special restrictions would, I think, be greatly strengthened by the adoption of the following procedure : (a) Labour immigrants. According to official estimates at the end ofDecember last, the figure of Jewish unemployment (combining total and partial unemployment) was 12,000, and on the basis of an investigation into the labour situation in the seven most important towns, there were 21,000 unemployed Arabs. It is clear that at the present time the admission of additional immigrants of the labour class would be difficult to justify. I would propose, however, to fix, a quota of 1,000 for this category on the understanding that it would be left to the High Commissioner to decide, in the light of economic circumstances, whether any labour immigration shall be permitted during the six months&apos; period, and if so, when and to what extent.(b) Students to be  admitted without numerical  restriction  under theconditions imposed in ^the Immigration Regulations. Under the regulations, Category B (iii) includes &quot; any student whose admission to an educational institution in Palestine and whose maintenance is assured until such time as he is able to support himself.&quot;
(c) Capitalist immigrants. A quota of 2,000 to be fixed for the &quot; capitalist &quot;class. The High Commissioner has recommended that twenty agricultural settlers with capital of not less than  500 should be admitted, and I propose that they should be included in the quota of 2,000.(d) Dependants. Dependants, as defined in Section 2 (1) of the ImmigrationOrdinance, that is to say, wives and children both of new immigrants and of immigrants who have already entered the country legally, to be admitted without numerical restriction. It is estimated that on the average each immigrant will bring one dependant.As regards more distant dependants (parents, &amp;c), a quota of 200 to be allowed in order to meet exceptional cases of hardship in individual cases.18. The details of this proposal have been discussed with Sir Arthur Wauchope and are based upon information which he has supplied. If, as I propose, the categories of near dependants and students are left unrestricted by quota, any estimate of the total number of immigrants who may be expected to enter during the six months period April-September, 1938, can only be a rough one. Assuming the entry of the maximum of 2,000 capitalists and 1,000 labour immigrants, a rough estimate of total immigration can be made asfollows : (a) Capitalists       ..................... 2,000(b) Labour immigrants     ...      ...      ...      ...      ...      ... 1,000(c) Near dependants of immigrants who have already entered 600(d) Near dependants of 3,000 new immigrants under (a) and(b) at rate of one dependant per immigrant    ...       ... 3,000(e) Special allocation for &quot;distant&quot; dependants      ...      ... 200(/) Students          ..................... 1,5008,300As noted above, this estimate is a maximum figure. If the arbitrary quota of the last eight months were maintained, immigration would be limited to 6,000 for the six months&apos; period, and under my proposal total immigration might reach a figure either slightly above or slightly below 6,000 probably the former. Much depends on whether economic conditions improve sufficiently to allow of any labour immigration. I may add that, according to the Director of Immigration in Palestine, it is estimated that in order to maintain the present proportion of Jews to non-Jews a Jewish immigration of approximately 17,000 a year is required.   This is due largely to the higher Arab birth-rate.Procedure.19. When the global quota of 8,000 was fixed for the period August 1937 to March 1938, the High Commissioner divided this quota between the various categories of immigrants in consultation with the Jewish Agency. I may observe that, in accordance with Article 4 of the Mandate, which defines the position of the Jewish Agency in relation to the Administration of Palestine, it has been customary for the Government of Palestine to take the Agency into consultation not only in connection with the preparation of the half-yearly labour immigration schedules but in connection with the drafting of immigration legislation and immigration policy generally.If, as I propose, it is agreed that on this occasion no global maximum should be imposed as in the Statement of Policy of July last,* I feel that His Majesty&apos;s Government (not the High Commissioner) should accept responsibility not only for the decision on the major question of policy, viz., the extension for twelve months of the validity of Section 5&apos;A, but for the specific limitations to be imposed in the case of each category of immigrants, and I have informed Sir Arthur Wauchope accordingly. In the circumstances, there will be no scope for consul-tation between the High Commissioner and the Jewish Agency in Palestine, but I have taken the opportunity of inviting Dr. Weizmann, who has recently
returned from Palestine to England, to submit representations to me on behalf of the Agency. Dr. Weizmann s views are embodied in a letter which is annexed to this memorandum as Appendix II. It will be seen that he presses strongly for a reversion to the status quo as from the 1st April, employing the arguments which have been already discussed in earlier paragraphs of this memorandum.20. If my recommendations are accepted, I would propose to instruct the High Commissioner to convey the decision of His Majesty&apos;s Government to the Jewish Agency without delay and to take appropriate steps to give effect to that decision. I would propose at the same time to communicate the decision to the League of Nations and to Parliament.. W. O. G.Colonial Office, February 24, 1938.
APPENDIX I.Section 5a of the Palestine Immigration Ordinance.&quot; THE High Commissioner may, in his unfettered discretion, by Order in the Gazette, exercise all or any. of the following powers, that is to say, he may (i) Prescribe the maximum aggregate number of foreigners to be admitted to palestine as immigrants during any specified period; (ii) Prescribe categories of immigrants and fix the maximum number of persons to be so admitted in respect of any category.This section shall expire on the 31st March, 1938, or on such later date as the High Commissioner in Council, with approval of the Secretary of State, by notice in the Gazette may appoint.&quot;APPENDIX II.The Jewish A gency for Palestine,77 Great Russell Street, London. W.C. 1, February 21, 1938.My dear Ormsby Gore,YOU were good enough to invite my views on the question of immigration into Palestine after the period ending the 31st March, 1938, for which period His Majesty&apos;s Government have decreed a total Jewish immigration of all categories of 8,000 persons.2. Immediately after the publication of the July White Paper announcing-this decision, you may remember that I had an interview with you in which I informed you that it would come as a severe blow to the whole policy of the Jewish National Home, and would constitute a fundamental infringement of the Balfour Declaration and the Mandate as officially interpreted ever since 1922 by the British Government and the League of Nations. We could hardly avoid seeing in this decision a denial of our basic right of returning to our National Home &quot;as of right and not on sufferance,&quot; as well as a reversal of the positive obligation under the Mandate to facilitate Jewish immigration. It would amount to a political and economic catastrophe for us if prolonged beyond the 31st March, 1938.3. The White Paper of 1922, which served as the basis for the confirmation of the Mandate itself, explicitly laid it down that Jewish immigration should be limited only by reference to the economic absorptive capacity of the country, and this for purely economic reasons to ensure that the immigrants &quot; should not be a burden upon the people of Palestine as a whole, and should not deprive any section of the present population of their employment.&quot; Consequently it became the declared policy, as well as the established practice, of the Mandatory Power that Jewish immigration should be regulated by the economic absorptive capacity of the country, and this principle was sanctioned by the League of Nations.4. In the imposition as from August last of an arbitrary and artificial political high-level or rather low-level for immigration, we can scarcely help seeing the first, and decisive, step in the destruction of the Mandate, so far as it concerns the Jewish National Home. This decision was made simultaneously with a declaration that the Government accepted the major recommendations of the Royal Commission that partition would be the best and most hopeful solutionThe Right Hon. W. Ormsby Gore, M.P..Colonial Office, Downing Street, SW. 1.[16755] c
of the Palestine problem. But you yourself, as the Accredited Representative of His. Majesty&apos;s Government before the Mandates Commission, declared in Geneva in August 1937 that you &apos;&apos; certainly had no intention of conveying the impression that the Balfour Declaration was not still a binding obligation, both on the League and the. United Kingdom. Obviously, like the, Mandate, it was still a binding obligation, and would remain so until replaced by an independent Jewish State. It was only if the suggested plan of partition were accepted, and eventuated in the creation of a Jewish State, that the Balfour Declaration would reach its fruition and cease to be binding. Similarly, the Mandate was binding until it was replaced by another regime in Palestine.&quot;The Council of the League of Nations, at its session of the 18th September, 1937, declared that the Mandate of 1922 remained in force until such time as it might be otherwise decided.5. The view that the arbitrary limitation of immigration otherwise than by reference to economic capacity is contrary to the most authoritative interpreta-tions of the &apos;Mandate is not only our view; the Chairman of the Mandates Commission, at its last Session, recalled that in 1930 the League Council, on the advice of the Commission, &quot; had accepted the principle put forward by the Mandatory Power itself, namely, that Jewish immigration into Palestine should be authorised to the extent allowed by the country&apos;s absorptive capacity.&quot; The Mandates Commission adopted a resolution declaring that it &quot; notes the Mandatory Power&apos;s decision to reduce Jewish immigration temporarily, as from the 1st August, 1937, to 8,000 persons for the nexteight months.....It feels bound to draw attention to this departure fromthe principle sanctioned by the League of Nations that immigration is to be proportionate to the country&apos;s economic absorptive capacity.&quot;The Rapporteur to the Council of the League of Nations noted this decision of the Mandates Commission in his report, and the Foreign Secretary in his speech at the same Session said that &quot; His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom are prepared to accept the Rapporteur&apos;s report, and to undertake to give consideration to the suggestions that have been made.&quot;6. Not only is the imposition of a political high-level contrary to the. Mandate as officially interpreted, but it is also having a most injurious effect on both the economic and the political situation in Palestine. So conspicuous a departure from the Mandate, when the Government declares that the Mandate is still in force, can only be interpreted by the forces of destruction and anarchy in the country as a surrender on the part of the Government to terror and violence, and it is in effect an encouragement to further violence. It provides the Mufti with the best possible proof that, if terror is continued, there is nothing that cannot be extracted from the British Government. The continuation of a purely arbitrary control of immigration, in contravention of the Mandate and of former practice, means clearly that the Mandatory regime in Palestine has given place to a purely arbitrary regime, which subjects the fate of Jewish immigration and the future of the Jewish National Home to the free play of destructive forces.7. The economic effects of this unfortunate measure are no less serious than its political effects. The economic depression which is now being acutely felt in the country, while it is no doubt due in part to the lack of security and the political uncertainty as regards the Governments intentions, is very largely a direct result of the cutting off of the import of capital, as a consequence of the new measure. In dealing with the economic aspect of the question, I will mention only the three main categories of immigration : (a) immigrants of independent means; (b) labour immigrants; and (c) dependents of Palestine residents.8. The new Immigration (Amendment) Ordinance which was based on the decision of His Majesty&apos;s Government in July, 1937, empowers the High Com-missioner to prescribe not only the maximum aggregate number of immigrants to be admitted into Palestine in any specific.period, but also to prescribe categories of immigration, and to fix the maximum number of persons to be admitted under *each category.  This means that not only can the High Commissioner fix the total
number of immigrants to be admitted in any given period, but also the maximum number to be admitted under any of the five categories prescribed by the existing Regulations. -(a) The prescription of an arbitrary maximum for immigration of persons of independent means will be, especially at the present time, a grave blow both to the economic life of Palestine and to our people abroad. It means the artificial restriction of the import of capital into the country. As you know, Palestine&apos;s imports of commodities far exceed her exports, and this unfavourable balance of trade is largely compensated by the steady influx of capital brought in by the &quot; independent means &quot; immigrants. The immigration of &quot;capitalists,&quot; on the one side, increases the purchasing power of Palestine, and, on the other side, creates, through investment, new enterprises providing work. for Palestine labour. The artificial curtailment of this category of immigrants thus deals a double blow to the economy of the country. In answer to a question in Parliament the other day, you mentioned the economic depression now existing in Palestine: one of the root causes of this depression is the decrease of capitalist immigration brought about by the political high-level. While even during 1936, the year of the disturbances, more than 250 capitalist immigrants, on an average, came into Palestine every month, after the fixing of the maximum, the number fell to less than 100 a month. No greater distortion of the purpose of the Mandate can be imagined than such a policy, which is calculated to dry up vital forces essential for the upbuilding of the country.(b) The second main category of immigrants is the Labour Schedule. This type of immigration is limited under the ordinary immigration regulations of the country, and it is normally determined, as you know, every six months by the High Commissioner, in his full discretion, after the Immigration Department, in consultation with the Jewish Agency, has conducted a thorough investigation into the urgent requirements of the labour market. If, as a result of trade depression, the Government shoulckbelieve that it is desirable to take a very conservative view of the labour market&apos;s requirements, there is nothing in the existing law to prevent the Hj^**Commissioner from fixing a reduced labour schedule. No justification whatsoever can be found for adding to this discretionary power the further powTer to impose an arbitrary numerical maximum. While this maximum may be fixed in advance, the High Commissioner is in no way bound by the new Ordinance to admit even the number then fixed; if, in his view, the requirements of the labour market are smaller, he is fully entitled to cut down the figure. The fixing of a maximum in advance can only mean that, although the High Commissioner may be of the opinion, after careful investigation, that more workers are needed, he will be bound by a political maximum to prevent their entry. The result would be that urgent work actually in hand would not be carried out because of lack of labour, and instead of facilitating Jewish immigration as enjoined by the Mandate, the Government will be holding up necessary works, and preventing the arrival of fresh labour actually required in the country.(c) Dependents of residents in Palestine children, wives and aged parents  are normally admitted to the country if the resident in question can satisfy the authorities, in each individual case, that he is able to support them. Fixing a maximum for this type of immigrant, means that children will have to stay separated from their parents, wives from their husbands, although the respective parents and husbands are fully able to support them in Palestine, Tnerely because they happen to fall outside the maximum arbitrarily imposed. Such a measure is not only unjustified and contrary to the whole spirit of the Mandate, but is also cruel from the purely human point of view.8. At the last Session of the Council of the League of Nations, the Foreign Secretary stated that the limitation of immigration was &quot;a purely temporary measure,&quot; and added: &quot; What is to happen when the period of eight months is up, that is to say after the 31st March, 1938, must necessarily depend upon the progress made in the meanwhile with the partition scheme.&quot; We know very well that during these eight months no progress has been made with the partition scheme, for the simple reason that no action whatsoever has been taken by the Government, and it would really be unjust if Jewish immigration were to be penalised and to suffer still further because of the Government&apos;s inaction. With-out considering here the question of partition, I must point out,; that nothing
could be better calculated to strengthen and encourage Arab sabotage of the Governments new plans than the further curtailment of Jewish immigration. I cannot see how a single Arab can be found to co-operate with the Government in preparing its new plans so long as the Arab leaders, and the members of the Arab Higher Committee, can justly point out that the new measures taken with regard to Jewish immigration represent in fact the complete fulfilment of the main Arab demand, namely, the crystallisation of the Jewish National Home, and the condemnation of the Jews to permanent minority status. The extremist forces among the Arabs will be given the upper hand through any extension of the political high-level and they will thus have it in their power to prevent any &quot;progress with the partition scheme,&quot; and to continue indefinitely the present state of affairs.9. In conclusion, I must point out two general considerations which cannot, I think, be ignored : (i) The growing distress of the Jewish masses in Central and Eastern Europe. I need hardly tell you much about the position of our people in Germany, Austria, Poland, or Roumania, except to say that, if any departure from the principle of economic absorptive capacity might be justified on political grounds, it would be a departure on the side of increase, and not of restriction.(ii) In this distressed world, where disregard of international Treaties becomes ever more prevalent, it is vital to the interests of peace to strengthen general confidence in British good faith and in British attachment to the rule of law, and to international obligation.10. I would most earnestly urge that this temporary departure from the fundamental obligations of the Mandate, undermining, as it does, both security and economic development in Palestine, as well as the vital interests of our people, should be discontinued as from the 1st April, and that Jewish immigration pro-portionate to the economic absorptive capacity of the country should be restored from that date as sanctioned by the League of Nations.Yours very sincerely, (Signed) Ch. WEIZMANN.
