PART I.    , 1&quot;Mediterranean and General Subjects.General.In selecting the concessions we desire from the Italians, we should endeavour to include matters where French interests will also stand to benefit, particularly where Spain and the Libyan garrison are concerned,,     This is all the more necessary inasmuch as the French will not themselves be participating in the conversations and to that &quot;extent we shall, so to speak, be in charge of their interests.
2oSpain,It seems desirable that the question of intervention in Spain should remain within the province of the Non-Inter-vention Committee but that if, owing to Italian action, things do not go well in that Committee, the British Ambassador in Rome should be instructed in any particular case to draw the attention of Count Ciano to the difficulties and ask for his help in solving them.     In this way the action about inter-venuion in Spain would be parallel with the conversations in Rome but non-intervention would not be placed on their agenda.A reaffirmation of the Mediterranean Agreement of January 2nd 1937 regarding the maintenance of the territorial status quo in Spain should be obtained.     It should be noted that Count Ciano has already expressed willingness to agree to this (see Rome telegram No.85 of January 22nd)    His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador might make a personal suggestion when this point is discussed that, in view of public opinion, it would be very desirable if the Italian Government would make a gesture withdrawing their forces from the Balearic Islands and ceasing to use them as a base.     It is unlikely that the Italian Government will agree to such a sweeping pro-posal but they may well concur in withdrawal of at least a considerable number of these forces.
Libyan Garrison.In 1934, before the Abyssinian dispute, the Italian garrison consisted of about 20,000 native troops.    In the course of last year two army corps otf white troops were transferred to Libya, and it seems probable that the present garrison consists of about 55,000 white troops together with from 15,000 to 20,000 native troops.     In the last month tnere have been rumours that one or even two additional army corps were to be despatched to North Africa.     These rumours, however, have not received substantial confirmation and there&quot; is as yet no evidence that any units of these two further corps have yet either been despatch-ed to or landed in Libya.The existence of this large force constitutes a threat not only to the French in Tunisia but to Egypt.     We should certainly attempt to obtain a reduction of this garrison, but it is doubtful if the Italians would agree to withdraw more than one army corps.Count Ciano has taken for granted in differentconversations
conversations that the Libyan Garrison would form one of the subjects for discussion.   He must now realise that we shall require some reduction of that garrison and it seems probable that-he would, be willing to make a conciliatory gesture on this point. It might further be possible to obtain an undertaking that the Italian Government would construct no works and keep no troops other than frontier guards at a certain distance from the Egyptian frontier if Egypt would do likewise, i.e. a demilitarised zone.There would certainly be muchNdifficulty in obtaining Italian assent to any restriction of accommodation and supplies for any large air force.The question of how far Egypt should be consulted and kept informed requires consideration.   Up to the moment the Egyptian Government have been assured that they will be kept informed of any subject raised in the convers tions which affects Egyptian interests and that no deeisic on any such subject will be taken without prior consultati with them.   The question as to whether we should go any further than this (for example whether at any stage or in the discussion of any particular subject the Egyptian Government should be represented in the conversations - a course which In Lord Perth&apos;s view would considerably complicate matters) remains to be decided.
5.Exchange of Military (in the wj.dest sense of the term)Information.On this point the naval, military and air Attaches in Rome received instructions last September as to what they might divulge and what they should ask for in return.     The question of such an exchange of information is a desideratum of the Italians, having been raised by Count Grand! in the original instance without authority from Rome.     So far as we know, the Italian Government do not set any particular store by the inclusion of such an item in the agenda.     We should on the whole prefer that it should not be included;   but in our instructions to Lord Perth in October (Foreign Office telegram No. 315 to Rome of October 2nd) he was authorised to inform the Italian Government that Eis Majesty&apos;s Government were prepared to include the item in the agenda, and an aide-memoire to that effect was left with Count .Ciano.It seems doubtful whether Italy will wish to pursue this point, but if it is raised by Count Ciano it would be difficult for Lord Perth to demur in view of our previous commitments.     In that event he would refer home in order that appropriate instructions should be issued to him.
6.Limitation of Forces and Fortifications.The Italian intention was reported last year to fortify the island of Panteileria, v/hich lies halfway between the coast of Sicily and the African coast, as an aeroplane base.     It is for the consideration of the Service Departments whether we should make a point of requesting its demilitarisation.     There are several other Italian islands between Sicily and the African coast - Linosa, Lampione, Lampedusa (lying westward of Malta, halfway between that island and the African coast).     The Service Departments might advise whether these islands have any potential military value as air or submarine bases, regarding the demilitarisation of which it might be advisable to ask for assurances.In the Dodecanese it is understood that the Italians have made extensive developments in their fortifications on some of the islands, particularly Leros.Up till now no suggestion has been made-on the Italian side that any limitation of British forces and for Mediterranean would form one of their deside: to agree on our side to any limitation of foJ of our freedom of movement in the Mediterrane impracticable to ask for it from the Italians since they would at once urge parity of treatment.     The same holds good of fortifications. It is assumed that an arrangement by which no further fortifications should be undertaken by either side would not be acceptable from our point of view, particularly having regard to the possible development of Cyprus, Haifa and Alexandria.Subject to the views of the Service Departments it would, therefore, seem preferable to take no initiative in raising such -que-stions except where the Libyan garrison is concerned.nfications in theata.     If we aie unable ces or to restrictions an, it would be
-3 -*, r/The League of Nations.It was originally intended that Italy&apos;s resumption of co-operation in the League of Nations should be a sine qua non of any negotiations with Italy.   Recently, however, the Italian Government have definitely severed their link with the League and it unlikely that they will consent to return to it unless (a) Germany returns and (b) the Covenant (in particular Article 16) is revised.So far as can now be foreseen, there is no likelihood of Italy being willing to modify this position - and it would therefore seem to be a tactical mistake to include among our desiderata an item which we are, in this form at least, so little likely to secure.
110 1 i oRecognition of the Itglian^conquest of Abyssinia.We are commit ted in the, House of Commons to the attitude that a decision on this point rests not with His Majesty&apos;s Government alone, but is one for the League of Nations.    Iwhen the question of such recognition was first raised last year it was laid down that we should, when the time came, consider this Question on its merits and not make use of it as a lever to extract specific concessions from.the Italian Government in return.   The situation, however, has now altered since in his note of December 25rd the Italian Charge d&apos;Affaires was instructed to say that &quot;The Italian Government are still of the opinion that the problem of relations between Italy and Great Britain should be approached and solved in its entirety and not partially.   All the subjects should be discussed and amongst them naturally also that of the recognition of Italian sovereignty over Ethiopia.   This is a purely moral question, but it is a fundamental one for Italian public opinion and could not, therefore, be left out of a general settlement of Anglo-Italian relations.&quot;In view of Signor Mussolini&apos;s insistence, it is clear that recognition in some form or another will have to be included in the conversations, and it is a question of tactics as to how and when it should be granted.   If we are pressed on this point at the outset, possibly the best solution would be to give an undertaking, when the conversations began, that if agreement were reached on all the outstanding questions between His Majesty&apos;s Government and Italy, His Majesty&apos;sGovernment
9.Government will at the earliest opportune moment take steps at Geneva with a view to removing the existing obstacles in the way of the recognition of Italian sovereignty overEthiopia.Care, however, must be taken not to nut the French into the position of being forced to follow our example in conceding recognition without having had an opportunity of making use of this lever to secure a solution of the questions in which they are specially interested.
Central Europe.It had been originally intended to seek from Italy a re-affirmation of the Stresa Resolution regarding Austria (see Annex 2).    Recent events, however, have shown that as   things stand at the moment Italy is not prepared to move where Austrian independence and integrity are concerned.It seems certain that one of the principal objects in Signor Mussolini&apos;s mind in seeking to conclude such an early agreement with us is that his hands should be liberated in order to deal more effectively with the German menace to Austria and Central Europe.     Ee is bitter at the events of Berchtesgaden. It will, however, obviously be difficult to extract from him any pledge as regards his future action in the event of a further German threat to Austrian independence, though Lord Perth would not rule out the possibility that before the final conclusion of the conversations SIgnor Mussolini might be informed that we trust that he will for his part do his utmost to restrain Berlin from any further encroachments on Austrian independence, assuring him that he would have our support in so doing.     ivhile Signor Mussolini would not, in Lord Perth&apos;s view, be willing to risk an armed conflict with Germany over the Austrian question, he might well tell Herr Hitler that any further moves to diminish Austrian independence would be likely to lead to a weakening of the Berlin-Rome axis, thus leaving Germany isolated.Careful consideration has been given to the possibility that His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador should say something to Signor Mussolini in regard to Central and South-Eastern Europe on lines similar to those suggested in the case of Austria.     It is felt, however, that any such action at the present time would serve no useful purpose and would arouse suspicions as to the motives of His Majesty&apos;s Government.
-4 Cs A 1/1Jl    JLNaval Treaty..Ve should undoubtedly seek to obtain the accession of Italy to the London Naval Treaty of 1936 in the negotiation of which she participated but which she refused to sign at the last moment0     Up till Italy&apos;s adherence to the anti-Comintern pact between Germany and Japan it was always felt that this would present no difficulty when the actual time for the conversations arose     It is still possible that, not-withstanding the latter event, Italy will prove amenable on thi point.   In any event it should be pressed.One of the great advantages which would result from Italia accession would be that Italy would be technically prevented from disposing of her existing war vessels to other foreign powers, unless completely demilitarized;     this has particular importance with reference to Spain.
i- .\J .-JEconomic Quest:&apos;) ons.Count Ciano j.n conversation with Lord Perth gave no indication that Italy had any desire to put forward economic points in the forthcoming conversations.Negotiations started on February 22nd for re-allocation of the quotas under our trade agreement with Italy now that the old debts have been paid off and the quota allotted therefor is free.   This aspect of the economic relations between, the two countries will, therefore, solve itself presumably in the normal course of events.   Hitherto the Italians have let it be known that they were not seeking a loan.     It is always possible however, that they may endeavour to raise one in London and to obtain better credit terms generally in the City.   It is felt that we should take no initiative in this respect but leave it to the Italians to raise the question themselves. -There are, however, other more general fields such as currency reform, restriction on quotas, Danubian economic reform, the van Zeeland report, in which we might seek their cooperation.   On the whole, however, since the primary purpose of these conversations is to make, as it is hoped, early progress towards a better understanding, it is felt that it would be wiser to leave all these economic questions completely out of the agenda of the conversations and let them be raised in. the natural course of events rather than seek to complicate the conversations by their introduction at the beginning if at all.
Propaganda,)One of our chief complaints against the Italians is the propaganda which they have instituted oyertly and covertly against British policy, British character and British institu-tions.   It is unquestionably essential that this propaganda must cease, but there are two schools of thought on the subject of how to secure its cessation.     There are some who consider that it should form an integral part of the conversations and that we should come to no agreement with the Italians unless we can obtain satisfactory assurances as to its cessation. There are others who maintain that once the conversations begin., the propaganda will die down of itself and that there v/ill be no necessity to put the subject on the agenda unless there should be a recrudescence of it during the conversations themselves, when the matter could be promptly taken up with the Italian Government.We should desire that any final agreement should Include firm assurances as to propaganda generally, but the best method of approach is a question of tactics on which a decision is required.In arriving at that decision we should bear in mind that whereas the Italians, owing to their governmental control of all organs of propaganda, can give and implement assurances on the subject, His Majesty&apos;s Government have no such powers and are not in a position to give any reciprocal assurance (e.g. they are unable to control what is said by the opposition in  -Parliament or by any organ of the free press).Lord Perth thinks that when he informs Count Ciano of our readiness to start conversations at once, he might well saythat ...
that he trusted that in order to secure a favourable atmosphere for the conversations anti-British propaganda v/ould cease.   He believes that Count Ciano will take steps at once in this direction both as regards the Bari broadcasting and the Italian press.     He would prefer to deal with the subject of Italian agents in Palestine and the Mid-die East during the course of the conversations,,
PART II. , r.Near and Middle East Sub,-)ects. AraJrLa.The main concern of His Majesty&apos;s Government, who have themselves no ambitions in regard to Arabian territory, is thatno European Power, and particularly Italy, should establishitself on the Arabian shore of the Red Sea.   Apart from this,His Majesty&apos;s Government have no special desiderata in regardto the purely local aspects of Anglo-Italian relations in regardto Arabia.   British interests would be adequately safeguarded if his Majesty&apos;s Government could secure from the Italian Governmentsome form of declaration on the following lines:-&quot;That the two Governments agree in so far as they are concerned, to do nothing to disturb the territorial status quo in Arabia and that neither of them will seek to obtain for itself a privileged position on the Arabian coast of the Red Sea.&quot;In the course of any discussions to which the negotiation of this formula may give rise, it should be possible to allay any Italian . suspicions regarding our present intentions and activities in Arabia. (See Annex 1)There are also one or two minor questions such as the disposal of Kamaran (where His Majesty&apos;s Government maintain a quarantine station) and certain other Red Sea islands, the sovereignty of which was left open by the Treaty of Lausanne. But unless the Italian Government raise these questions it will almost certainly be better to let their settlement follow, rather than form part of the re-establishment of Anglo-Italian cordiality.
Palestine.It may be possible, as it is certainly desirable, to obtain from the Italian Government an undertaking that they will refrain from any attempt to create difficulty for His Majesty1s Government either in the framing of policy for or administration of Palestine, provided that His Majesty&apos;s Government on their side are willing to undertake to respect legitimate Italian interests in that country.
Syria.Although the Italian attitude-towards the alteration or abolition of the Mandate in Syria is not primarily a concern of His Majesty&apos;s Government, any difficulty which might eventually arise between France and Italy over this question could not fail to have an unstoadying effect upon Anglo-Italian relations, even after a general settlement had been effected..It is somewhat difficult to include any questions relating to Syria, in Anglo-Italian conversations, but His Majesty-&apos;s Ambassador has hopes of being able to &quot;do something towards securing French interests here.       It is therefore suggested that it be left to Lord Perth&apos;s discretion how and when to discuss the matter, the most hopeful method of approach being to raise the problem as arising out of the Mediterranean declarations, and say that we assumed that any arrangement concluded by the League for the termination of the present Syrian Mandate would not be objected, to by the Italians as an alteration of the status quo.In any event His Majesty&apos;s Government will bear in mind the necessity that any negotiations which we undertake should not result in prejudicing in any way French interests In this area, but rather that they should do their utmost to safeguard these interests.
PART III. Abyssinian Subjects.The question immediately arises whether it would be wiser to treat these in the conversations proper, i.e. before recognition of the Italian conquest of Abyssinia was accorded, or to wait till after the grant of such recognition and deal with them then.     Many of them are highly technical subjects because they concern boundary adjustments and it may well be that negotiations about them would last for many months,thereby postponing the conclusion of the agreement for a considerable time.     Count Cia.no clearly was opposed to the inclusion of boundary questions in the conversations.     He suggested that it would be sufficient to conclude an agreement of bon voisinage which would allov/ things to function smoothly until the final boundary arrangements had been settled between the experts. In Lord Perth&apos;s view Signor Mussolini is likely to be more generous after recognition than he would be if we tried to use it as a bargaining counter in these Abyssinian matters.The particular questions involved are:-(1)   Lake Tsana - see Annex 2.(2)   The Sudan-Abyssinia frontier, including Gambeila) - see annex 5.(5)   The Kenya-Abyssinia frontier - see Annex 4. (4)   The frontier between British Somaliland and Abyssinia -see Annex 5.(5)   The frontier between British Somaliland and italian somaliland - see Annex 6. (6)   General British interests (trade,etc. ) in Abyssinia -see Annex 7.(7)   Specific British interests in Abyssinia - see Annex 8. (8)   The surrender of extraterritorial jurisdiction in abyssinia - see Annex 9.(9)   Extradition - see Annex 10. (10)   Missionary work in Abyssinia - see Annex 11.        On ...
On Questions 2-9 inclusive, some of which are plain boundary questions and others are of technical and limited importance, it is suggested that it would be inappropriate to complicate the general conversations by the inclusion of discussions on these matters9It would, however, be desirable for political and other reasons that the Ambassador should secure in the conversations, assurances on the following:-(A) Lake Tsana,(B) the principle of fair treatment in matters of trade, (G) the treatment of missionaries in Abyssinia, and(D) the raising of native armies.As regards (A), it will be hoped to secure from the Italian Government a reaffirmation of their previous undertakings fully to respect our existing rights.As regards (B), we should desire to secure reasonable and fair opportunity for British trade, taking full advantage of any applicable treaty provisions that we may be able to claim.As regards (C), we should endeavour to obtain as assurance of Italian intentions to apply to Abyssinia Article 11 of the Convention signed at St. Germain on September 10th, 1919, concerning the work of missionaries0     In short the effect of this would be that the Italian Government would agree to afford facilities for missionary work, without distinction of nationality or religion, subject, of course, to its responsibility for the maintenance of lav/ and order,,As regards (D), on every ground it is desirable to prevent, if possible, the raising of such an army by the Italian authorities. It is suggested that Lord Perth should press the Italian Government strongly to reaffirm to His Majesty&apos;s Government the assurance which they gave in their note to the League of Nations on June 29th,1936, that Italy on her part was &quot;willing to accept the principle thatnatives ....I
natives should not be compelled to other military duties than local policing and territorial&apos; defence. &quot;His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador should also have discretion to discuss with the Italian Government the financial situation and future of the Emperor Haile Selassie.
PART IV,&apos;    ALIHEX 1. Mote on- Arabian Formula.If a formula such as that suggested in the draft is to be adopted it will be essential to avoid the possibility of disputes as to what the territorial status quo now is, and further to avoid giving scope for Italian interference in the internal management of territories which we consider now to be under our control and pro-tection.     It would appear to be necessary that the formula should bo accompanied by a man on which lines were drawn and that it should be laid down that the formula meant that His Majesty&apos;s Government would not extend their influence beyond these lines.     The lines would run round the southern frontier of Trans Jordan, include Koweit5 and the territories of all the Trucial sheikhdoms on the Persian Gulf, Muscat and Oman, and the whole of the Aden Protectorate including the Hadramaut.   The South-Eastern part of the line might follow, for the greater part of its course, the so-called blue and violet lines of the Anglo-Turkish Conventions of 1913 and 1914, if necessary as modified by recent negotiations with the Imam. Further, it would have to be agreed that, though His Majesty&apos;s Government would in no circumstances extend their influence beyond this line, they reserved the liberty, as the result of negotiations with Ibn Saud and the Imam, to surrender territory inside the line to these Rulers,     Finally, it would also have to be agreed that as regards territories inside our line we reserved our liberty to increase or extend the intensity of our influence, to change the boundaries as between the respective Arab States under our protection, and to increase or decrease the degree of independence at present possessed by any of those Rulers,AS    * o * a
ooAs regards the latter half of the phrase, referring to privileged positions on the Arabian coast of the Red Sea, it would have to be raade clear that the expression &quot;the Arabian coast of the Red Sea&quot; does not include on the south any part of the coastline of the Aden Protectorste (which is, in fact, to the south of the opening of the Red Sea and on the Gulf of Aden only), and does not include on the north the small portion of the coastline of the Gulf of Akaba which is at present covered by the Palestine Mandate.
amkkx 2,LAKE TSANAUnder an Anglo-Ethiopian Treaty of 1902, an Anglo-Franco-Italian treaty of 1906 and an Anglo-Italian exchange of notes in 1925 Great iri+ain obtained certain rights in respect of the Blue and White Miles, The effect cf these rights is that Italy must not allow any works to he constructed on the Blue or -white wiles or their tributaries or iffluents which might sensibly modify their flow into the main river, .Hits subject to that proviso, a reasonable use cf the waters in question by the inhabitants of the region may be permitted.   His Majesty&apos;s Government also have the right to obtain the construction cf a barrage at   Lake Tsana and a motor road for the passage of stores etc, from the barrage to the Sudan frontier,&apos; subject only (1) to an obligation to employ, so far as possible, locally recruited labour in the construction and operation of the barrage, and (2) to the proviso that the barrage must not raise the level of the waters in the Lake beyond the maximum hitherto attained during the rainy season-   His Majesty&apos;s Government are entitled to obtain a concession for the construction of this barrage and its operation by themselves or by persons appointed by them.   (The question of the importance and -urgency of a barrage scheme from the point of view of Egypt and the Sudan is at present under review).   It is a clearer definition of the above rights which His Majesty&apos;s Government now desire to secure from the Italian Government.Finally, His Majesty5s Government can make a case for the de-limitation for a territorial zone pertaining to Great Britain in the region cf Lake Tsana; but such a case is not unanswerable and it seems in the highest degree unlikely that the Ita.li.an Government would con-cider such an arrangement unless really adequate compensation were offered in return.It is considered essential that the Egyptian Government should participate from the very beginning in any discussions which may take clace with the Italian Government on the subject of Lake Tsana.
THE SUDAN-AEYSSINIA FRONTIER 1 INCLUDING- GALlsEILA) .It is proposed that the Italian Government should he approached with a view to an exchange of territory being effected as between the Sudan and Abyssinia on the south-west section of the frontier (which has never been the subject of an agreed demarcation) terminating at Lake Rudolph.     Under this exchange the Sudan would acquire the Baro Salient in Abyssinia (in which British protected tribes habitually graze and water) and Italy a triangular strip of Sudan territory to the south of that salient.     The position of Gambeila (a neighbouring post in Abyssinia which under the Anglo-Ethiopian Treaty of 1902 was leased, to the Government of the Sudan, to be administered and occupied as a commercial station so long as the Sudan was under the Anglo-Egyptian Government) would also have to be regularised. As in the case of Lake Tsana, the Egyptian Government would have to be brought into discussions at an early stage of the proceedings.In the event of the above modification taking place the Government of Kenya would wish to acquire a small portion of Sudan territory adjoining their frontier, which would, otherwise be ceded to Italy.     In this area, under an agreement with the Sudan, the Kenya tribes are already permitted to graze.
annex 4.THE KENYA-AEY3SINIA FRONTIER.A modification of this frontier is required so as to inclr.de in Kenya certain areas in Abyssinia in which the Kenya border tribes habitually graze and water their stock during the dry seasons.     Failing such a modification, a continuance of trans-frontier grazing and watering arrangements for those tribes would be essential:   but for reasons of administration a rectification of frontiers would be far preferable.       Grazing and watering rights in the areas in question were secured to the Kenya tribes under an Anglo-Abyssinian Treaty of 1907, by which the Italian Government are bound in law;   but in order to secure the necessary facilities for the time being we recently agreed to hold conversations with the Italian Government on this and certain Italian requirements of a similar nature.      It is probable that in the event of a frontier rectification in favour of Kenya, the Italian Government will request corresponding modifications in favour of Abyssinia;   and the Government of Kenya have earmarked certain areas in Kenya which they are prepared to cede for this purpose.The area which we wish to obtain is small relatively to its importance to the Kenya tribes.
THE FRONTIER BETWEEN BRITISH SOMALILAND AND ABYSSINIA.A rectification of the southern frontier of British Somaliland is required involving the addition to the Protectorate of the traditional grazing areas of British-protected tribes up to the limits agreed upon by the Anglo-Abyssinian Boundary Commission of 1935, including the important wells of Walwal and tardeir.   It is improbable, however, that the Italian Government would agree to the transfer of those two places;    and for practical purposes it would suffice if the revised boundary coincided v/ith the limits of the grazing of British tribes as recognised in the Anglo-Italian Agree-ment signed in Rome on the 27th January, 1957..  That Agree-ment, which holds good   for a period of two years from the 1st March, 1957, and is renewable, established a&apos; mcjius vivendi whereby British tribes are free, subject to certain conditions, to cross the frontier to the grazing grounds and wells in former Abyssinian territory - a right which is legally secured to them under the Anglo-Abyssinian Treaty of 1897.About three-fifths of the inhabitants of British Somaliland have for years past been accustomed to cross and re-cross the front:.er in search of grazing and water, and to exclude them from their grazing grounds would be bitterly resented, would involve severe hardship and might lead to a serious threat to the internal security of the Protectorate. To secure for the British tribes access to their grazing areas south of the frontier is thus a vital interest of british somali land ....
THE FRONTIER.Scmaliland.   If the Italians refuse to agree to a frontier rectification, then it will he   essential to aim at a permanent arrangement for trans-frontier grazing on the lines of the Rome Agreement.   This agreement is reported to have been working satisfactorily hitherto in a season when there has been ample grazing, but in a poor season the Italians might impose unreasonable restrictions on the British tribes and they are not likely to agree to making the arrangement permanent, seeing that it involves the annual migration of large numbers of British tribesmen into territory under their own control.   Nor would the arrangement be satisfactorj?&quot; as a permanent state of affairs to the British Administration, for it would do nothing to relieve the great difficulties at present experienced in administering tribes many of whom spend a large part of the year out of British control.     The only satisfactory permanent solution would be the rectification of the frontier already described,,
)No boundary rectifications are asked for in this case, and it is considered that, the frontier agreed upon by the Anglo-Italian Boundary Commission of 1931 should be confirmed. It is desired at the same time to obtain the agreement of the Italian Government that the frontier should no longer be closed (as it is at present owing to their attitude) but that British and Italian tribesmen should be free to graze their stock on either side of it up to the limits of their traditional areas as defined by the Boundary Commission,     The grazing interests of British tribes&apos; are, however, much smaller here than in the south;   and if, as is probable, the Italians are unwilling to change their attitude, it is not considered that the British point should be pressed to the extent of endangering the far more important requirements on the southern frontier.THE FRONTIER BETWEEN &quot;BRITISH SOMALILAND AND ITALIAN SOMALILAND.
GNERAL BRITISH INTERESTS (TRADE ETC.)   IN ABYSSINIA.Although British and Indian trade interests in Abyssinia are negligible, and although there are no large-scale British enterprises established in Abyssinia, every endeavour, it is submitted, should be made to secure that British subjects have, as they had in the former Abyssinian Empire, equal opportunities for trading in Abyssinian territory, i.e. efforts should be made to restore the &quot;open door&quot; in Abyssinia.     Steps should also be taken, if practicable, to safeguard the direct and transit trade between Abyssinia, British Somaliland and the Sudan - a trade of some importance in the economy of the two latter territories.This object appears the more easy of attainment in that, with the recognition by His Majesty1s Government of the Italian position in Abyssinia, the latter country would be included among the &quot;dominions and possessions&quot; of Italy to which the Anglo-Italian Commercial Treaty of 188S applies.     Thereby would be secured, inter alia, the right of British subjects to come with their ships and cargoes to Abyssinia and to enjoy there national rights in the matter of commerce and navigation;   most-favoured-nation treatment for United Kingdom goods in the matter of import and export duties and prohibitions;   and national rights for British shipping.     Moreover, the Italian Government, in a note to the League of Nations of the 29th June, 1936 stated that measures would be taken to guarantee freedom of transit and communications and a fair treatment for the trade of all countries.Care, however, should be taken to avoid a situation arising similar to that in Manchuria, whereby requests for equality oftreatment..
treatment are met with invitations to invest money in the area concerned, while no effective equality is accorded in matters relating to the sale of goods.Outstanding trade debts from Abyssinia to the United Kingdom are believed to be very small, but provision should be made for their liquidation within a reasonable period.     An arrangement may be necessary in respect of payments for current trade and import and export permits.British subjects and British protected persons belonging to India should be secured the same rights and privileges which may be granted to other British subjects and protected persons. The Government of India are particularly interested in this point in view of the comparatively large number of Indians in Abyssinia.     It should be noted that under an   Anglo-Italian Convention of 1914, the Anglo-Italian Commercial Treaty of 1883 was extended to British India.
ANNEX 8. .SPECIFIC BRITISH INTS^STS: IN ABYSSINIA nFull implementation of the agreement regarding the buying out of the Indian firm of Mohammedally (In regard to which there have recently been delays on the Italian side) should be insisted upon.     A satisfactory solution of the matter of the expropriation of the Sudan Interior Mission should, also&apos;be pressodo     Finally, the Italian Government -should be reminded of the importance we attach to a speedy settlement of the case of the Ethiopian Motor Transport Company, whose road from Gambeila to Baro Gala the Italian authorities last year declared to bo open free of toll.Other minor natters with regard to which it would also be desirable to achieve a settlement are the blocking of British official and non-official deposits at the Bank of Ethiopia owing to the liquidation of that Bank, and the status of certain British Consular properties in Abyssinia.
52. ANNEX 9.SURRENDER OF EXTRATERRITORIAL JUSIRDICTION IN ABYSSINIA.j n the former Abyssinian Empire British consular jurisdiction was exercised by His Majesty&apos;s Consular Courts in Abyssinia under the Ethiopia Order in Council, 1954, in respect of civil and criminal matters affecting British subjects and protected persons in Abyssinia.   The Italian authorities were informed some time ago that His Majesty&apos;s Government would present proposals for the winding up of His Majesty&apos;s Consular Courts, and draft heads of agreement for this purpose have been worked out.   These heads of agreement, inter alia, provide for safeguards against British subjects and -protected persons in Abyssinia being enlisted in the Italian forces, deprived of communication with their Consuls, and so forth.   It is desirable that a satisfactory solution of this subject should be included in any general settlement.It is known that the French Government are interested in this matter, their position being very similar to ours; and we are under a moral obligation to consult them with regard to any step we may be proposing to take.
annex 10.Extradition.With the recognition of the Italian position in Abyssinia the Anglo-Italian Extradition Treaty of 1875 would automatically apply to that country.   The Colonial Office, however, desire to arrive at some arrangement with the Italian authorities, apart from the provisions of the Treaty, under which British protected tribesmen who commit, or have committed, offences outside the boundaries of British Somaliland may be brought to justice.
MISSIONARY WORK IN ABYSSINIA.Article 11 of the Convention signed at St. Germain on September 10th, 1919, revising the General Act of Berlin of February 26th, 1885, and the General Act and Declaration of Brussels of July 2nd, 1890, was invoked in Parliament on the occasion of the expulsion by the Italian Government, in the spring of 1957, of British missionaries from Abyssinia. But it was doubtful whether the Article could be used in this particular case, owing to the fact that His Majesty&apos;sNGovernment did not recognise the Italian position in Abyssinia. With such recognition, however, Italy&apos;s obligations under this Article would become applicable to Abyssinia, and it might be considered desirable to remind Italy of this fact.ANNEX 11.
