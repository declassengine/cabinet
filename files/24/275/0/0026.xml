(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S GOVERNMENT).SECRET Copy No.. %*. - cCP.   62 (38) CABINETBAKEHOUSES BILL. Memorandum by the Home Secretary.This Bill (which is promoted by the Labour Party and proposes to prohibit night work in bakehouses) was, notwithstanding advice given by Mr. Lloyd on behalf of the Government, accorded a Second heading in the House of Commons on the 18th February, a reasoned amendment by Sir Assheton Pownall and Mr. Fleming against the Bill being rejected by a majority of 147 to 126.        Twelve supporters of the Government voted with the majority.      The Bill will shortly be considered in Standing Committee and the Government attitude has to be decided.Under existing practice men are employed at night every week and on every night of the week except Saturday without any alternation to day work, and the main argument for the Bill is that this deprives them to a large extent of the opportunities of family and social life enjoyed by other workers.On the other hand, the Departmental Committee under.-Lord Alness which reported in July last was against such legislation.      They found that no case was made out on the ground of injury to health and while they fully recognised the social disadvantages, came to the conclusion that pi*ohibition would not provide any satisfactory amelioration of the conditions. So fax1 as the Committee could judge, the result of abolishing night baking would be that about half the men who now woi*k all night would have to start work at 5 a,m. while the other half would be called upon to work an afternoon and evening shift
(Sundays included) and thus have even less opportunity for social life in the evenings and at the week-end than they at px*esent enjoy.      Further, the Committee found&quot;&quot;that the prohibition of night baking - though it would not materially affect the supply of fresh bread to the public - would cause considerable dislocation of the industry and work unequally amongst employers and would inflict hardship in many cases including a number of those where the best conditions prevail.At the same time the Committee were impressed by the need for better organisation in this industry and suggested that some representative body should be set up on which the representatives of both sides might meet together to thrash out their difficulties and devise means for improvement of conditions.      The Government accepted this suggestion and, after negotiation with the organisations of both sides and with their concurrence, the Minister&apos; of Labour announced in the House on the 1st February that he had decided to proceed with a draft Special Order for applying the Trade Boards Acts to the industry.The hours worked in this industry are scandalously long in many cases and the wages inadequate, and the view taken by my Department and the Ministry of Labour is that the main evil in this industry is not so much the night work in itself - which is the only matter dealt with in the Bill - as the conditions under which it is carried on;       that a Trade Board which will have power to declare a normal working week and fix special rates for overtime and also special rates for night workers, would be able to secure a vast improvement in the general conditions, and that while some legislative scheme for restriction of night baking may well be found desirable in the
future, it would be better to postpone dealing with this matter until the trade had been propex-ly organised and conditions as regards hours and wages put on a proper basis.It has to be kept in view that there is a great deal of night work in other industries and that, apart from mines, night wox*k has not been prohibited for adult males in any industry.      It is claimed by the supporters of the Bill that the practice of night work in the baking industry is unique in that there is no alternation to day work;    but this is by no means c.O rect - there are other industries and employments where night woxvk is cax*ried on without any such alternation.      It is also to be noted that the Bill proposes - and this is a cardinal point of the scheme - to give the Secretax-y of State powers by Or*der to extend the prohibition where necessax*y to the one-man baker who does his own baking without employing anyone.The organisations of Master Bakers have, I understand, intimated their intention to oppose the Bill in its further stages in every possible way, and       threatened*eaten that if the Bill makes progress they will withdraw their- support from the Trade Boax*d.      Thei*e is px*obably not much x*isk that they could be successful in stopping the establishment of a Trade board*d but it would be within their power&apos; to insist on an inquiry and thus hold it up for a considerable time, and the px&apos;ospects of effective co-operation on the Board when established would of course be sex*iously prejudiced.Dr. Haden Guest, the promotex&apos; of the Bill, has written to Mr. Lloyd saying that he gathers the Bill has a lot of Conservative support and thinks that with a little Government benevolence, the Bill could be easily put through,.     Every one, of coux*se, must feel a great deal of sympathy with the operatives in this matter but I think that our attitude is fully justified and that the action we are taking to impx&apos;Ove the conditions in the industx^y will be accepted generally as adequate.
4cThe Bill as it stands is, I am advised, defective in various respects.      For example,  it makes no provision for enforcement, though I understand the intention is that the Home Office should be made responsible through the Factory inspectorate, and the definition of the industry is drawn much too widely,I recommend -(1) that in Committee the Government should reserve complete freedom of action and should not take upon itself any responsibility for the Bill by moving amendments but$. subject to this, should lend such assistance as it can towards making the Bill a workable measure.      The position can, of course, be reviewed again if necessary after the Committee stage has been concluded.(2) that as far as the Government is concernedevery possible step should be taken to expedite the setting up of a Trade Board. I have consulted the Minister of Labour who concurs in this memorandum.S.H.11th March,  1938.
