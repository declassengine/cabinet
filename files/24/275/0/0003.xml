THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;3 GOVERNMENT.COPY No. &apos;W- I yCABINET. BACON INDUSTRY;    REORGANISATION AND ASSISTANCE. Memorandum by the&apos;Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries.1.   My colleagues will recall that the situation of the British bacon industry was considered last summer by the Agricultural Policy Committee of the Cabinet and, as a result, I was authorised (Cabinet 32(37)) to make a statement of policy in the House of Commons, which I did at the end of July, to the effect that the difficulties of the industry appeared to the Government to be attributable- in part, to the increase in pig feeding costs and, in port, to the high costs of bacon manufacture]    that the Government believed that if the industry were founded on a smaller number of efficient factories provided with regular supplies of good quality pigs, sufficient economies could be secured in the cost of curing to enable the- industry to be maintained during periods of high feeding costs;    that, subject to being assured that factory rationalisation would be put in hand, the Government were willing to propose that assistance should be given to the industry over a sufficient period to secure the restoration of the contract system for the sale of pigs by farmers to curersj and that the industry would be consulted as to the nature of the changes that would be required and the form which they should take.2.    Following this announcement, discussions were openedearly in September with the Pigs and Bacon Marketing boards and continued until the end of last month.3.    I am glad to be able to report that agreement has beenreached.with the industry on the structural and other changes that are required.     The agreement, which is conditional on theindustry being satisfied with our financial proposals, coversorganisation, marketing arrangements and factory rationalisation1.SECRET. CP.39(38) .
4.      As regards organisation,  it is proposed to centralise policy control over the more important functions of the two Marketing Boards in the hands of a new Bacon Development Beard which will contain a strong independent element.      It is proposed also to vest in this &quot;body certain powers additional to those.now enjoyed by the Marketing Boards,  in order to overcome difficulties w&apos;::.ich have emerged in practice.      The principle of self-regulation is, nevertheless, being preserved.5.      As regards marketing, adjustments are to be made to facilitate the working of the pig-csntract system.6.      As regards factory rationalisation, the curers recognise that there is an excess of curing capacity and, in particular,  in the number of units competing for the pig supply.      It is proposed that the initiative for framing a raticnalisation scheme shall rest,  in the first place, with the Bacon Marketing Beard, who have already referred the problem to a committee consisting of Sir Harold Howitt, F.C.A. ,-Mr. W.P. Spens, K.C., M.P.  and the Hon. Jasper Ridley (Vice-ChairmanLof the National Provincial Bank).      The bases of the scheme will be:-(a) the classification of curers in size groups with different rights and obligations;(b) the tightening-up of efficiency standards,particularly in respect of the larger factories;(c) the raising of funds &quot;by levies on the industry,out cf which to compensate curers whose licences have been cancelled voluntarily or compulsorily on the ground of redundancy. In order to encourage enterprise, provision will be made (i)    for new entrants into the industry, due regard being had to the rights of existing curers,
(ii) to enable curers to pass from one group to another. It is proposed to exclude from the contract system and from the risk of compulsory acquisition? small curers whose weekly output is below a maximum to be defined.7.      The proposals outlined above are.-  I think; to be commended as a method of approach to the problem of factory rationalisation, which holds promise of a useful scheme likely to give producers and consumers improved service at lower cost.8.      proposals for Exchequer assistance have been formulated and the details are under consideration with the Treasury.      The principles governing such assistance are as follows:    It is proposed (a)  to require curers to pay a fixed price for pigs which is remunerative to efficient producers at a given level of feeding costs, and (b)^to compensate pig producers, in respect of pigs sold on contract;, for all increases in feeding costs over that level.      It is assumed that something slightly under the current level of bacon prices would enable bacon curers to pay the fixed price for   pigs and. it is  therefore? proposed (c) to compensate curers against any fall in bacon prices below the critical point;    such a fall might be occasioned by the need to admit increased imports of bacon and hams from Dominion and foreign countries and; in particular? from Eire and the U.3.A.      Conversely? the benefit from any increase in   bacon prices would accrue to the Exchequer.9.      It is proposed that Exchequer assistance should be given in respect of a maximum in the first year of 2?200?000 pigs? in the second year of 2?4-00?000 pigs and in the third year of 2,600?000 pigs;    the figure of 2?200?000 is above the total of home-produced pigs used for bacon in 1937 but equal to the total so used in 1936.10.    Assistance would be for a period of three years only?
which is considered to he the minimum period necessary for tangible results of rationalisation to be realised;    full realisation will, however, take a longer period than three years and, in fact, the curers are understood to be preparing a five-year plan.11.      Inasmuch, however, as some.of the anticipated economies should be realised in the second and third years, the principle of a steepening taper is being introduced in those two years in order, firstly, to recover for the benefit of the Exchequer some part at the least of those economies and, secondly,  in order to demonstrate that the whole purpose of the plan is to bring the industry on to a lower cost basis.12.      The cost of these proposals to the Exchequer must depend on certain unpredictable factors, such as the prices of feeding-stuffs and of bacon.      It is unlikely that the present high prices of feeding-stuffs will persist without leading to a further diminution of breeding stocks in Europe and North America and therefore to a further increase in bacon prices, but on the unfavourable assumptions that food costs do so persist, that total bacon and ham supplies are maintained and that bacon prices do not hold their recent rise, the cost should not exceed in the first year  1,180,000* in the second year  1,220,000 and in the third year  1,120,000.      On the highly unfavourable assumption that,  in the given circumstances, total supplies of bacon and hams are not only maintained but increased by,  say,  500,000 cwt., the effect on bacon prices might be to increase the cost by about  330,000 in the first year and  240,000 in the second year; in the third year, the Exchequer liability would be unaffected. On the other hand, a fall in the prices of feeding-stuffs seems not unlikely;    a fall of 1/- a cwt. would save about  660,000 in the first year, over  700,000 in the second year and nearly  &amp;00,000 in the third year.4.* This figure assumes that 2,200,000 pigs are put on contract in Great Britain in the first year.      In view of the decline in home production that has taken place since 1936, this assumption is optimistic, although its realisation is possible and provision for it is politically desirable.
13,      These proposals will involve legislation, both as regards reorganisation and finance, and I should be glad if my colleagues would approve them in principle in order that I may be in a position to give the industry, without further delay, the reassurance that it needs.14.      With the assent of the Prime Minister, the greater part of the necessary Bill (i.e. the part dealing with reorganisation) has already been drafted, so that if my proposals are approved the legislation to give effect to them can be completed and brought before the Home Affairs Committee and Cabinet in the ordinary way at an early date.15,      The Department of Agriculture for Scotland has been associated throughout with the negotiations which have taken place and the Secretary of State for Scotland authorises me to say that he concurs in the proposals.(Intld.)    W.S.M.Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, 18th February, 1938.
