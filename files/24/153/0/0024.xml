The power of amending the Act of Union which was given to the Union Parliament by the Act itself is of course well known to the Nationalists, whose main idea in connection with their present visit is no doubt to improve their political position in South Africa.The increased facilities for repatriating those released from Imperial units will give much satisfaction.The Enemies Repatriation Bill has been strengthened in Committee. This and the anti-Bolshevik measures show an- appreciation of the danger of harbouring a certain class of alien in the Union.India.The news regarding disturbances continues to be satisfactory.Other Colonies, Protectorates, &amp;c.There is little to report from Egypt, where the outstanding feature appears to be that the students refuse to return to the schools.

BRITISH  EMPIRE   AND   AFRICA  REPORT.SELF-GOVERNING  DOMINIONS.CANADA.Imperial Preference. With regard to the British Budget proposals for Imperial preference, considerable interest has been aroused in the Dominion.Mr. S. It. Parsons, past President of the Canadian Manufacturers&apos; Association, said that the important thing was the adoption of the principle of preference, and he had the impression that in some lines United States manufacturers would bring their raw material iuto Canada to get the advantage of the preference for export trade with British countries.Mr. Thomas Fincllay, General Manager of the Massey-Harris Company, manu-facturers of agricultural implements in Canada, said that preference would undoubtedly help the company as the United States industries were it3 chief competitors.The Toronto Star says the British preference is upon tea, cocoa, and rum.   It is, therefore, of no importance to Canadian farmers.   Canadian manufacturers will be interested in the preference on watches, clocks, and musical instruments, but on the * whole the effect upon Canadian&quot; trade does not promise to be very great.The Toronto Times says that the proposals of Mr. Chamberlain should greatly stimulate both agricultural and industrial production in the outlying parts of the Empire. They will accentuate the tendency of American capital to build manu-facturing plants in Canada.The Toronto Globe writes : Any benefit that Canada may derive from the establishment by Great Britain of Imperial preference will &quot;be reaped by the Canadian manufacturers rather than by the Canadian producers of foodstuffs.The Montreal Gazette emphasises, as do so many other Canadian newspapers, that it Avas the privilege of Mr. Austen Chamberlain to announce that the Govern-rnent of the United Kingdom had adopted the iDrinciple which his father did so much to advance.   .The Montreal Star says that Canadians will watch with eager interest to see-how the proposals are received in the Motherland.Labour Unrest. In Toronto the metal trades, carpenters, painters, and decorators are on strike, affecting some 6,000 employees and 225 factories. In Ottawa 3,000 men in the building&quot; trades have struck and demand an. average increase of wages of 30 per cent., with weekly payment and an eight hour day. Labour unrest is also apparent at Halifax and Winnipeg.The Regina Trades and Labour Council have endorsed the &quot; One Big Union &quot; movement.Air Matters. The Government Bill to authorise the appointment of an Air Board for the control of aeronautics was presented in the House of Commons last week. The Board will consist of not less than five and not more than seven members, who will be appointed by the Governor-in-Council. The Chairman will be a Minister of the Crown, while the Militia and Navy Departments will be represented.The Board will supervise all aeronautical matters, study the development, uncler-take technical research, construct and maintain Government aerodromes, and investigate the proposals for a. commercial air service within or starting from the Dominion.In the House of Commons this week the Minister of Militia (General Mewburn) - stated that the perpetuation of the Canadian Air Force would undoubtedly be included in the forthcoming reorganisation of the Militia.Immigration Bill. The Bill to amend the Immigration Act is being considered in Committee of the House of Commons. The Minister of Immigration and Colonisa-tion stated that it aimed to improve the cptality rather than increase the quantity of the immigrants. Under the Bill numerous undesirables, such as alien enemies, drunkards&quot;, and mental and physical weaklings, would be barred. Generally, the measure sought to populate the farming areas rather than the manufacturing centres. There were billions  of  dollars,   said  the Minister, lying dormant in   Canadian
natural resources, and the Dominion was not paying enough attention towards getting in the people who would plough the land. Mr. Calder added that it was the intention to exclude all skilled and unskiUed labour from Asia. In conclusion, the Minister stated that though thousands of people wished to come to Canada from Great Britain, it was inopportune yet for them to do so, as the Dominion must settle her own soldiers first.Mr. Rodolphe Lemieux (0., Gaspe) remarked that he was informed there was a strong tendency on the part of many Belgians to come to Canada.The Minister said that was so. He agreed that the Belgians would make good citizens, but considered the time was not ripe for bringing people into the Dominion from Continental Europe. He was inclined to believe that within a year thousands of British soldiers would be glad to come.At a subsequent sitting of the House considerable discussion took place and the view was generally expressed that certain men who were unable to read or write made better citizens than educated foreigners, who were continually creating unrest. Mr. J. A. Calder explained that the system suggested was similar to that of the United States, but expressed his willingness to put a rider in the Bill giving discretionary powers in this matter to the Minister of Immigration.Soldier Settlement. Up to date 5,000 returned soldiers who have applied for the advantages of the Soldier Land Settlement Scheme of the Dominion Government have been approved. A total of 140,000 acres of &quot; Hudson&apos;s Bay &quot; reserve land has been thrown open for soldier settlement.National Railways.-The National railway^s Bill has been the subj ect of considerable dismission in -the House of Commons, but has now passed the Third Reading by a majority of 54. Mr. W. S. Fielding voted against the Bill and only one or two Western members of the Opposition were present when the vote was taken.Output of Silver. Canada&apos;s output of silver in 1917 was 22,200,000 ounces, or about one-seventh of the \world&apos;s production.Oil Schemes. Oil concessions in Western Canada are sought by two large corporations, one of which has applied to the Federal Government and the other to the B.C. Government.The Shell Transport and Trading Company have made application to Ottawa for the sole right of exploiting 250,000 square miles of territory in Northern Alberta and the North-West territories.The other application is from the D&apos;Arcy Exploration Company, Limited, and a subsidiary, the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, who seek permission from the B.C. Government to explore 3,600 square miles of land.AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH.Labour and Russian Internal Affairs.- At the sitting of the conference of the Victorian Branch of the Australian Labour Pai^ on April 20th, a resolution was carried protesting against any interference in the internal government of Russia.Labour and State Governors.-Members of the Labour Party in Tasmania are urging the abolition of the office of State Governor.Petroleum in Neio Guinea. The Melbourne Age reports the discoveiy of great petroleum wells of high commercial value in the portion of New Guinea captured from the Germans, and states that information obtained by a party of expert investigators from America has been confirmed and amplified since Australians occupied the territory.Pre-War Values for Sugar. Mr. Rnox, the General Manager of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company of New South Wales, while giving evidence before the Inter-State Commission, stated that the present indications were that there would be a reversion to pre-war values for sugar, probably in 1920.
NEW ZEALAND.Naval Affairs. The Minister of Defence (Colonel Sir James Allen), addressing the Navy League at Dunedin last week, is reported in the Press as saying that it was impossible to indicate the Dominion&apos;s naval policy, upon which Lord Jellicoe would advise, but he was satisfied that no cash contributions would be sufficient. It would&apos; be an everlasting disgrace if the Motherland engaged in naval combat with New Zealand&apos;s manhood unrepresented. If they valued freedom they must take a share, and train men for a unit in the Imperial Navy.Developments in the. Pacific. The Minister of Defence (Colonel Sir James Allen) stated on May 4th, according to Press cables, that he viewed developments in. the Pacific with some alarm. It was difficult, he said, to discover why Japan wanted the Marshall Islands unless she wished to-dominate the Pacific.Coal Shortage. -The Dominion Ministers have called attention to the serious position in the Dominion due to the coal shortage. The Acting Prime Minister has requested the Secretary of State fGr the Colonies to use his influence to arrange for overseas vessels to bring as much coal as possible from Newport News and Newcastle en route to New Zealand.Municipal Elections: Position of Labour. At the Municipal Elections on April 30th it is stated in the Press that Labour failed to capture the Christchurch and Wellington mayoralties, despite a split in the opposing votes. At Christchurch the. Labour vote was 2,306, and the anti-Labour 11,695. At Wellington, Labour polled 1,643 and the anti-Labour vote was 10,891. Labour secured six out of 15 seats on the Christchurch City Council (a gain of one seat), four out of 15 on the Wellington Council (all gains), and three out of 22 at Auckland. The women candidates mostly failed, but Auckland elected two on the Council.SOUTH AFPJCA.Nationalist Deputation. The Union Government have been informed that the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom has been asked by the Nationalist Deputation for an interview with the British Government, and that the Nationalists are being-told that as soon as pressure of business, allows they will be received by Mr. Lloyd George, who, however, desires to have first a statement of their case in writing.Repatriation of Soldiers in Imperial Units. The Union Government, have been informed that the Army Council regret the difficulties which have occurred in dealing with the repatriation of individuals released from Imperial units. It is pointed out that besides the great shortage of shipping the constant dock strikes made it impossible to guarantee any vessel sailing on the scheduled date. The Arrny Council add that as the organisation is being overhauled, increased accommodation has been recently placed at their disposal, and they expect the position this month to be satisfactory.Aliens&apos; Repatriation. -The Enemies Repatriation Bill (vide Report No. 113) has been returned to the Union House of Assembly from a Select Committee with its provisions considerably stiffened. The Minister is empowered to remove by warrant any interned person fouud by a Commission to have assisted the enemy&apos;s cause, hampered the British cause, or attempted to raise discontent in the Union. Provision is made for the repatriation of enemy subjects&apos;not domiciled in the Union or of those who, being in the service of an enemy State, were in the Union after the commence-nient of war. Denaturalisation is made to apply to persons who remained subjects of an enemy State. The Commission of Enquiry has been strengthened by the appoint-ment of a judge as chairman. Amendments to the Bill also give the option to wives . of enemy subjects who were British subjects before marriage, or domiciled in the Union, to remain in the Union.Anti-Bolshevik Measures. In the Union House of Assembly, in reply to a question by Sir Thomas Smartt with reference to a possible renewal of the troubles which occurred recently at Johannesburg between International Socialists advocating
Bolshevik doctrines and returned soldiers, the acting Prime Minister (Mr. Malan) announced that the Government would immediately introduce a Bill providing for the registration of all aliens and the removal of people participating in Bolshevik or other dangerous propaganda.Natives and the Pass Laws. A number of native meetings were held on May 2nd, at which the speakers urged adherence to the passive resistance movement as. regards the Pass Laws, some of them even advocating a native strike. No disturbances occurred.INDIA.Eioxs.The Viceroy has reported to the India Office as follows : Punjab. Telegrams of April 30th and May 1st stated that all was quiet at Lahore and Amritsar; In the Kasur case, 11 of accused had been sentenced to death and 4 to varying terms of imprisonment. In the Lahore case against Ganesh Das, the accused was acquitted.About 60 arrests had been made by the movable column at Patti; the arrests of Sadhus were continuing.At Lyallpur all was quiet, and the villagers were giving up accused persons on approach of movable columns. A telegram of May 1st reported serious dacoiting with a loss of Rs. 50,000 near Jaranwala. In Jullundur the movable column was accom-panied by an Indian Muhammadan magistrate, who explained the Rowlatt Bill at Darbars held by the officer commanding.Telegrams of April 30th and May 1st reported all quiet at Delhi, Ahmedabad, Bombay and elsewhere.Departure of Uorniman. The Viceroy reported on 28th April that, with the previous approval of Government of India, the Bombay Government had issued orders, under Rule 3 D, Defence of India Rules, requiring Horniman, editor of the Bombay Chronicle, to leave British India and proceed to England. He was placed on board the S.S. Tahada, which sailed from Bombay on April 27th. This action was taken in view of the inflammatory propaganda being conducted by him which was likely to be the cause of a recrudescence of recent trouble and. also of fomenting discontent among the troops by the free distribution to them of his paper/South African Indians and Rowlatt Bills. At a mass meeting of Indians held at Durban on April 28th. a resolution w^as jjassed protesting against the XDassing of the Rowlatt Bills and placing on record the confidence of the meeting in the principles of &quot;passive resistance.&quot;A mass meeting of Indians also took place at Johannesburg, when a resolution was adopted expressing disappointment at the passage of the Rowlatt Bills in India. The resolution declared that these measures were &quot; contrary to the spirit of the repeated promises and assurances of the Imperial Government and show the gravest ingratitude for India&apos;s sacrifices,&quot; and urged the repeal of the most humiliating piece of legislation enacted in the annals of the Empire.&quot;The resolution also urged the appointment of a member of the Royal Family as Viceroy of India.Famine.The Viceroy reported on May 4th that recently sanction had been accorded to the distribution of gratuitous relief in part of the Unao Baclaun and Moradabad districts of the United Provinces. Distress was still severe in the affected tracts of Etawah, but elsewhere in the United Provinces it was slight, and the prospects were good. The number on relief was increasing in Bombay Presidency. The numbers relieved were: Bengal: test works 1.329, district board works 4,430, gratuitous relief 757 (th); Bihar and Orissa : test works 81,472, gratuitous relief 4,625. Feudatory States : Orissa: test works 10,924, gratuitous relief 15,121; United Provinces: test works 14,886, gratuitous relief 1^,119 ; Rajputana : Karauli figures incomplete, relief works -180, gratuitous relief 160 ; Ajmer-Merwara report not received ;   Central India :
relief works 13,002, gratuitous relief 7,353 ; Central Provinces : relief works 8,702v test works 22,718, gratuitous relief 39,127;  Bombay:  relief works 72,908, villao-e^ works 7,029, test works 2,728, gratuitous relief 92,407 ;  Madras : relief works&apos; 15,806,. test works 1,137, gratuitous relief 43,739.OTHER COLONIES, PROTECTORATES, &amp;c.EGYPT.Development of the Sitiiation. No disturbances other than attempted demonstra-tions, wkick were easily dispersed, are reported during tke week. Terrorists ordered all shops to be closed on April 30th, but very few responded. The situation is much easier.The extremists are still agitating in favour of strikes in the hope of impressing the Peace Conference and the Commission which they hear is to be sent to Egypt. Minor strikes continue to occur, but the number of workmen on the railways is now rjractically normal. Government officials have returned to work and the only absentees are the students from the schools. Among other general political demands of the usual nationalist type, the students require the dismissal of English advisers and officials at the Ministry, of Education and of all English schoolmasters and the disuse--of the English language in schools. On the 5th, General Allenby issued a notice to the effect that students who do not return by May 7th will not be allowed to compete in examination this year.Attempts have been made to make capital out of the news of disturbances in India and of the departure of the Italian delegates from Paris. There are also signs that an effort may be made to start a campaign accusing British troops of brutality in putting down the disturbances. There should be no difficulty in countering this, as the great forbearance and good behaviour of trooj)s has won the appreciation of all but the worst elements of the population.The efforts of the Egyptian Nationalist delegation in Paris have been largely directed towards securing the sympathy of the French Press. They have, however, met with no success except with some advanced Socialist newspapers. The disapproval with which their advances have been received by French officials is calculated considerably to discourage them.
