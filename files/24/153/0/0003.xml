SECRET.13APPRECIATION Oh&quot; THE ATTACHED REPORT No. 97.BRITISH EMPIRE AND AFRICA.Imperial Affairs..The communication to the Dominion Governments regarding the development of civil aerial navigation is of considerable importance.A list of the Dominion Ministers and Indian representatives visiting England for the peace discussions, with short biographical details, is given in the Appendix to this Report.Canada.The statement of the President of the Privy Council regarding the importance of Canadian representation at the Peace Conference derives additional significance from the fact that Mr. Rowell is the leading representative of Liberalism in the Union Cabinet.There are indications of a tendency to revive party politics in the Dominion.The estimate that within a year every Dominion soldier should be back in Canada is interesting. The demobilisation plans of the Government are well advanced.The Conference between the Dominion and Provincial representatives apj)ears to have dealt mainly with soldiers&apos; setilement problems and has not apparently resulted in any increase of Provincial powers over land.Newfoundland.The ajapointment of a High Commissioner places Newfoundland in the same position as the four other Dominions regarding representation in London.Australian Commonwealth.Having regard to the manifestation of Australian feeling upon the cpiestioh of exacting an indemnity from the enemy (vide Report 96) , it is of particular interest that Mr. Hughes has been serving as Chairman of the Cabinet Committee dealing with the subject.New Zealand.The Prime Ministers latest speech indicates an appreciation of the importance to Australasia of retaining captured territory both in the Pacific and in Africa. The references also to the matter of an indemnity and to the utilisation of German cruisers should be noted. [p.t.o.

BRITISH. EMPIRE  AND  AFRICA  REPORT.IMPERIAL AFFAIRS.Shipping for Dominion Troops. The Ministry of Shipping reported on November 25th, 1918, that although demobilization had not commenced, arrange-in ents were being made to send home Dominion soldiers and families. It was stated that the following men of low medical category were being brought forward by the respective Dominion authorities for repatriation, viz. : Canada      - about 15,000Australian Commonwealth - -       ,,    20,000New Zealand - - - 9,000Civil Aerial Navigation. Tlle Dominion Governments have been informed that in view of the termination of hostilities the British Government are anxious that civil aerial navigation should be developed as soon as possible. It is therefore, proposed that discussion should proceed with the Allies, regarding the draft International Convention given on pages 27 and following of printed reports of the Civil Aerial Transport Committee. It is pointed out that the British Government have made certain alterations in the draft which have the effect of clearly asserting the principle of national sovereignty in the air usque ad eoelum over national territory and territorial waters, but that subject to that principle the Convention is so drafted as to involve the smallest iDossible number of restrictions upon the freedom of international aerial communication. The Dominion Governments are asked whether they agree to the principles of the draft Convention, and it is stated that the Air Council intend to discuss the matter with the Dominion Ministers in London.SELF-GOVERNING   DOMINIONS.CANADA.Representation at the Peace Conference. The President&apos; of the Privy Council (Mr. N. W. Powell), in a speech last week at Port Hope, made some important references to the representation of Canada at the Peace Conference. After declaring that no more important question than the relationship of Canada to the proposed League of Nations could arise in the lifetime of the present generation, Mr. Rowell said: &quot;It is essential in Canada&apos;s interest that she should be represented at the Peace Conference, and that her voice should be heard in the solution of these great problems. The people of Canada will not be content with anything less. The number of the British Dominions undoubtedly creates great difficulties in the way of representation at the Conference. All have done so well, and one would like to see them all represented. This may not be possible ; but if only one representative from the oversea Dominions can form a part of the British Delegation to the Peace Conference, that one undoubtedly should be from Canada. Canada is the oldest and largest of the Dominions, and the one which has made the greatest contribution to the war. Her political relationship with Great Britain and her geographical and intimate commercial association with the United States give her a peculiar oppor-tunity of interpreting the one to the other, and aiding in securing the largest possible measure of co-operation between the two great branches of the Anglo-Saxon race.&quot;Return of Soldiers and their Dependants. Since the armistice was signed there has been, according to information given out at the Headquarters of the Overseas Military Forces of Canada, great demands upon the Canadian military authorities for the return
to Canada of dependants of soldiers.   Large parties of these- have already proceeded, and others are &quot;being provided for.While it -is of course recognised that general demobilisation of the fighting forces cannot commence so long as the troops are required, it is the intention of the Overseas Military Authorities to send back in the meantime to Canada all the casualties fit for discharge from hospitals and convalescent homes and men in various branches of the service in England and in France whose services are no longer required by reason of the armistice. Through the carrying out of this policy, the fighting men can be returned with the least possible delay when the scheme of general demobilisation begins. It is considered that, allowing for every possible contingency, within a year every Canadian soldier should be back in Canada.Scheme for Demobilisation. In the scheme for demobilisation the Department of Militia has divided the Dominion into 21 dispersal areas. Irrespective of where the soldier enlisted he may choose the district to which he goes for the final act of demobilisation.Labour and the Government. Representatives of Labour had their annual inter-view last week with the Dominion Government with the object of asking Parliament to adopt legislation putting into effect many recommendations as set forth, at the yearly meeting-of the Trades and Labour Congress. The requests included the suggestion of pensions for widowed mothers and deserted wives, in addition to pensions for widows and children of sailors and civilians, compulsory sickness insurance, higher land taxation, and minimum wage regulations. The Government promised consideration of the proposals.Conference with Provincial Premiers. The Conference between the Dominion Government and the Provincial Premiers (vide Report No. 96) concluded last week. Mr. F. B. Carved, who presided throughout the sittings, announced that no formal resolutions had been adopted. Apart from the question  of the transfer of Western lands in the Prairie Provinces, in regard to which the Eastern and Western Provinces did not agree, there vras no need for any formal resolution. The primary object of the gathering, it was explained, was to exchange ideas as to the proper1 steps to be taken to grapple with problems which must be faced immediately as a consequence of the sudden termination of the war.The definite result of the Conference is that.for the present, at least, the Federal Government will continue to administer the natural resources of the three Prairie Provinces. The Conference discussed the land colonisation scheme proposed by Mr. J. A. Calder and the Soldiers&apos; Settlement plan put forward by Mr. Meighen. The demobilisation scheme was also brought before the Conference and explained by Mr. Meighen.Troops sent Oversea, &amp;c, during War. Official figures state that when Canada entered the war on August 4th, 1914, she had a permanent force of only 3,000 and an Active Militia of 60,0.00. When hostilities ceased on November 11th last, Canada had sent overseas 418,980 soldiers. On September 30th, 1918, the. Canadian troops in France numbered 156,250. Canadians engaged in the United Kingdom and France on railway and forestry work numbered about 50,000. Some-14,000 or 15,000 men were raised and trained for the R.A.F. in Canada, in addition to many who joined the Air Force after going overseas.Continuance of Red Cross Activities.--Th.e Canadian Red Cross-will continue to work with the same effort which has characterised their activities on behalf of Canada&apos;s soldiers overseas until Januury 1920, according to an announcement made by the Chairman. He said that so long as there is a sick or wounded Canadian soldier in England or France, the Society would render whatever comfort they could. &quot; The Society propose to look after the casualties as they are brought from England to Canada, and have also decided to offer assistance in restoring French and Belgian people to their homes.Party Politics. Following upon the speech of Sir Wilfrid Laurier (vide Report No. 96), there are indications of a revival of party politics in the Dominion. Mr. Walter Scott, ex-Premier of Saskatchewan, who has recently been in consultation with Sir Wilfrid Laurier, and who is prominently identified with Western Liberalism, has contributed a signed article to the Moose Jaw Times, in which he withdraws his
support from the Union Government and calls for the withdrawal of the Liberal members of the Government. . Mr. Scott says that the termination of hostilities leaves - him free to deal with the disappointing administration of the Government, and he proceeds to criticise the Governments policy.Mr. Robert Rogers, who as Minister of Public Works accompanied Sir R. borden to England in 1916, in the course of a public speech at Ottawa on November 29th&apos; said that the political truce was over and that the Conservative Party must be reorganised and strengthened under a revivified national policy.NEWFOUNDLAND.High Commissioner. The Government of Newfoundland have informed the British Government that they have decided to appoint as High Commissioner without salary Sir Edgar Bowring, M.L.C., who left Newfoundland for England on November 28th to take up his duties in London.australian  LIAN   COMMONWEALTH.Mr. Hughes and Question of Indemnity. At a meeting of the Imperial War - Cabinet on November 26th the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth (Mr. Hughes) was appointed Chairman of a Committee of the Cabinet to consider the question of an indemnity being exacted from the enemy with special.reference to the amount of such an indemnity, the means of payment, and the subsequent effect on the allied countries.Sale of Wheat. The Commonwealth Government have informed the British Government that in view of the conflicting rumours in Australia, as to the new sale of wheat to the British Government, the Acting Prime Minister (Mr. Watt), in order to allay financial unrest, found it necessary to make a statement in Parliament. The New South Wales Minister of Agriculture (Mr. Graham) had publicly stated that the Commonwealth had effected a sale of wheat to the British authorities of one million bushels at 4-s. 9d. a bushel, and to both of these allegations the Acting Prime Minister has given a; flat contradiction.NEW ZEALAND.Prime Minister on Pacific and Africa : Indemnity : and German Navy. The Prime Minister (Mr. W. F. Massey), speaking in the House of Representatives last week, is reported in the Press to have said that he believed there was no danger of Germany recovering the Pacific Colonies, but that retention solely by Great Britain was less certain. He strongly deprecated any divided control, which had failed in the. New Hebrides. The disposal of Germany&apos;s African territory vitally concerned Australasia owing to her strategic relations with the Suez route. He was unable to estimate Germany&apos;s capacity to pay an indemnity, but New Zealand was entitled to a proportionate share of whatever might be obtainable. He trusted that the German Navy would be retained, and a cruiser or two made available for New Zealand.The Liberal Parly and Sir Joseph Ward. -The Liberal Parliamentary Caucus, has, according to a published statement, recommended Sir Joseph Ward to accept the invitation of the British Government to represent New Zealand, with Mr. Massey, at the War Cabinet and Peace Conference, and has urged loyal adherence to the party compact till the leaders return.War Expenditure. It has been publicly announced that the total war expenditure of the Dominion amounts to 5I,400,000Z., of which 39,25O,OO0Z. was raised in New Zealand.SOUTH] AFRICA.Prime Minister and Hepublicanism. Before leaving South Africa by the Iyo Maru on November 23rd General Botha delivered a speech in which he appealed that nothing might be done to prejudice the relations between different sections of the population.   &quot;Many a difficulty,&quot; he said, &quot;has already vanished and my strong
INDIA.(Excluding External Affairs, which are dealt with in the Eastern Report.)Constitutional Reforms : Franchise and Functions Committees. The Committees on Franchise and transferred and reserved subjects are engaged in their work. The Viceroy informed the Secretary of State by telegram of November 27th that the following are the names of Provincial Additional Members of Reforms Committees : Franchise. Madras : Dewan Bahadurs Swamikannu PiUai and Subbarayrdu Reclcliar; Bombay : L. C. Crump and K. Natarajan; Bengal: Stevenson Moore and Dr. Sukrawardy ; United Provinces : L. M. Hopkins and C. Y. Chintamani; Punjab : P. J. Fagan and Sardar Sunder Singh Majithia ; Bihar and Orissa : H. McPherson and Rai Bahadur Krishna Sahay ; Central Provinces : C. U. Wills and Sitacharran Dube ; Assam :  Colonel Gurdon and Khan Bahadur Syed Abdtd Majid.Functions. Madras : M. E. Couchman and Khan Bahadur Muhammad Habibuliah ; Bombay : P. J. Mead and N. M. Samarath ; Bengal: Ironside and P. C. Mitter; United Provinces : Sir Verney Lovett and Raja of Mahmudabacl; Punjab : H. J. May-nard and Raja Norendranath ; Bihar and Orissa : E. H. Walsh and Raja of Kanika ; Central Provinces : J. T. Marten and M.. V. Joshi ; Assam : Dr. Reid and Rai Bahadur Ghanstwam Barua.The Delhi correspondent of The Times (London) telegraphed on November 23rd that &quot; an important question of principle arises from the committees&apos; work. It is whether the Montagu-chelmsford Report is to be considered as a basis for discussion, which was the avowed idea of its authors, or as a settled fact. There is a strong feeling in most progressive Local Governments that the scheme of administration proposed for the provinces is unnecessarily complex, if not unworkable, and should be improved by abolishing the distinctions between Executive Councillors and Ministers, rendering the Council a homogenous body, securing a unitary instead of the diarchical form of administration, reducing the number of reserved subjects, and simplifying the procedure to secure the ultimate will of the Government in the event of differences with the Legislative Assembly.&apos;&apos;Ruling Princes and Reforms. -The Maharaja of Patiala has written a letter in repudiation of Sir John Hewett&apos;s statement that &quot; if the Maharaja of Patiala correctly interprets the feeling of the ruling Princes, they will assuredly not be found enthusiastic supporters of the Reforms scheme.&quot; The Maharaja quotes the statement which he made to The Times, and refers to the speech which he made when admitted an honorary freeman of Cardiff. He adds that the recommendations of the Report regarding the Indian States are the outcome of a draft scheme prepared by a Committee of Princes of which he was a member, and both in the scheme and the personal discussions with the Viceroy and Mr. Montagu the Princes made it clear that they fully sympathised with the legitimate aspirations of the people of India. If they had been hostile their attitude would have found clear expression, and Sir John Hewett&apos;s statement exceedingly surprised him.Excess Profits Tax. The Government of India have reiterated their decision to impose an excess profits tax. This wiU be a charge of 50 per cent, on all excess profits earned in 1918-19, the average profits of the four preceding years being the basis of calculation. Businesses paying excess profits duty in the United Kingdom will be.exempt. - .7001-laBdesire is that present conditions may give birth to the spirit of cordial assistance and mutual trust that is essential to the upbuilding of South Africa.&quot;Regarding recent developments of Republican propaganda, General Botha said : &quot; I can only repeat that a Republic is only possible in South Africa in case both races desire it. Hence it is not in the realm of practical politics and any attempt at forcing it must culminate in bloodshed and disruption of the body politic.&quot;Result of By-Election. At the by-election for the Pietermaritzburg (South) seat in the House of Assembly, which was rendered vacant by the death of Dr. R. A. Buntine (South Africa Party), who was lost in the Galway Castle, the South Africa Party candidate (Mr. 0&apos;Brien) defeated his Unionist and Labour opponents.
