BRITISH   EMPIRE   AND   AFRICA  REPORT.IMPERIAL AFFAIRS.British Empire Delegation. At a meeting of the British Empire Delegation held on March 29th (B.E.D. 14) the question of International Labour Legislation was discussed in relation to the various articles of the draft of the Labour Convention. The sense of the delegation was that the Convention should be a separate Convention under the League of Nations and that it should be obligatory on all members of the League to adhere to the Convention, which should be signed separately and by separate parties.At a meeting of the British Empire Delegation on April 3rd the above subject was again discussed, and also the question of the future of Constantinople and the control of British burial grounds on the Gallipoli Peninsula.*Emigration of Ex-Serviee Men. In reply to a question in the House of Commons on April 8th, the Under Secretary of State for the Colonies (Lieut.-Col. Amery) announced that ex-service men who are accepted as approved settlers under any settlement scheme of the oversea Governments, or can show that they have assured employment awaiting them, and are otherwise acceptable to the authorities of the Dominion to which they wish to proceed, will be given free passages for themselves and their dependants to the nearest convenient port to their destination overseas. The same privilege, subject to the same limitations, will be extended to ex-service women, i.e., women who have served in one of the recognised women&apos;s service corps, including, for this purpose, the Land Army.SELF-GOVERNING   DOMINIONS.- CANADA.Industrial Investigation: Joint Control of Capital and Labour-Speaking in the Senate last week the Labour Minister (Senator Gideon Robertson) announced the appointment of a Commission composed of five or six members, including represen-tatives of labour and capital, to proceed to ail centres of industry in the Dominion to survey the situation in all its aspects, to ascertain all the facts and to report to the Government before May 15th next upon the possibility of joint control and operation of certain industries by capital and labour.Leading up to this statement the Minister gave a comprehensive review of the labour situation in the Dominion. There was an intense and growing desire, he said, * on the part of working men that there should be a greater measure of industrial democracj&apos;, by which was meant that working men felt that through some means of organised effort they should have a voice in the control and conduct of industries. This attitude was largely born of the fact that whereas in days goue by the vast majority of the emphwers were the proprietors of their industries, to-day they were confronted by a system which, by vast centralisation of capital, made contracts between the workers and their employers impossible, thus rendering co-operation between and - loyalty to one another extremely difficult. The result was that the employees were - compelled to organise and strike for fair conditions under Avhich to give their labour, and this, in turn, brought difficulties, disputes and frequent strikes.Referring to the Lemieux Act, Senator Robertson said that this legislation proved wise and beneficent, but it did not meet the new conditions. The Government felt to-day that what was reqttired was not so much the settlement of disputes and strikes, but their prevention.   The Government were working along the lines of. greater
106co-operation and understanding, and felt that by this means a more hopeful order could be secured.Public Health and Housing. The Governments Bill to establish a Department of Public Health/has passed its second reading in Parliament and the House afterwards went into Committee. &quot; After some discussion, the President of the Privy Council (Mr. N. W. Rowell) stated that it had been the settled policy of the country to spend large sums of money in bringing immigrants to Canada, and while they were doing this the health of their own people was neglected, and infant mortality and preventable disease flourished. He gave figures of medical examination under the Military Service Act, showing that out of a total of 180,440 men who passed through the doctors&apos;hands, 81,255 were rejected as unfit. The Government housing scheme, the Minister said, could be entrusted to the proposed new Department. In the course of the criticism of the Bill offered in Parliament, observations w-ere made as to encroachment on the rights of the Provinces and as to the infringement of the rights of individuals.Repeal of Military Service Act. In Parliament last week Dr. Belaud asked whether it was the intention of the Government to provide for the repeal of the Military Service Act as soon as demobilisation was completed.The Acting Prime Minister (Sir Thomas White) replied that the Act provided only for reinforcements to the Expeditionary Force, and that an announcement would be made in due course.Government and Grand Trunk Railway. The Grand Trunk Pacific Railway question was again brought before the House of Commons last week on a Government motion asking Parliamentary sanction for two Orders-in-Council appointing a Receiver. The Acting Prime Minister (Sir Thomas White) suggested that the ultimate solution to the present problem would be the acquirement of the Grand Trunk in addition to the Grand Trunk Pacific. The Minister asked members not to press him for further particulars, &quot;because negotiations with that end in view were not completed, adding that he thought the whole of the Grand Trunk concern would come under the control of the Government. A third reading was given to the Bill confirming the Orders-in-Council by which the Government placed the. Grand Trunk Pacific in the hands of the Minister of Railways as Receiver.Next Dominion Loan. The Finance Department.have announced that there is no likelihood of a Dominion loan until the autumn. It is added that there is no foundation for &quot;the report that there would be one in June.National Anthem: Compulsion in Ontario. A Government Bill in the Ontario Legislature requires the National Anthem to be played at the close of all performances in theatres.NEWFOUNDLAND.General Election. The Lower House of the Legislature on April 4th unanimously passed through all stages the measures necessary for holding a general election next mouth. The Upper House is expected to sanction the measures this week, in which case the Legislature will be dissolved next week.AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH.Pacific Islands, Indemnity, and Fiscal Freedom. The Acting Prime Minister (Mr. Watt), at the gathering of the Victorian Chamber of Manufactures on March 28th, said that the Federal Parliament would meet as early as the deliberations of the Peace Conference would permit, and deal with the tariff. Australia required to be made more replete in respect of necessary industries, both primary and secondary, than in the past. The future of the world for perhaps a century was being settled in Paris, things, pregnant with fate for the future of Australia were hanging in the balance.The Prime Minister, Mr. Watt proceeded, was there fighting with the full approval of the people of Australia for three things : one was the future of the German colonies in the Western Pacific in the interests bothol the safety of Australia and the well-being of the inhabitants of the islands. Australia should control these, he believed, because every indication pointed that way.   That struggle which Mr. Hughes had sustained
since November until now would work in their favour, and Australia would be granted at least a mandatory Government in those islands, the possession of which meant everything to the security of future generations in the country. The Prime Minister was also advocating Australia&apos;s legitimate claims against the broken German Empire and people for reimbursement of some of the cost of the war. If the claim were not advanced strenuously and successfully, Mr. Watt declared that two or three generations would have to bear the blighting effect of a huge burden of taxation. Mr. (Hughes was fighting also, the Acting Prime Minister continued, for the fiscal freedom of that part of the British Empire, and he (Mr. Watt), without the slightest hesitation, and speaking for a unanimous Cabinet, said that whatever might be the basis of peace, Australia could not surrender its fiscal rights, but must control its own destinies in this matter, and must have the right as an intelligent progressive democracy to determine under what conditions and standards of comfort its people should live.Mr. Watt on League of Nations and Bolshevism. In the speech to which reference is made in the preceding paragraph, the Acting Prime Minister (Mr. Watt) said that he made no prediction as to the success of the League of Nations, but it carried with it a gospel full of hope for the human race. Whether they believed the experiment would succeed or not, they must work for it. There was everything to gain and nothing to lose by a trial of this great experiment, but a League of Nations was not the only thing necessary. What Australia also wanted was a league of the whole nation to work unitedly for its welfare and safety. There was unfortunately arising in Australia a spirit that bid fair to challenge the spirit of Bolshevism. Many people, thoughtless and unheeding, believed this was a new doctrine involving the re-incarnation of man. Were they going to one of the least educated countries of the world-to learn lessons of liberty ? He did not believe history would read the recent outbreaks of Bolshevism in any country in the world as anything but an unforgiveable crime. After detailing the doctrines of the Russian Soviets as set forth in a pamphlet printed in Australia, which, he said, made one wonder how anyone outside a lunatic asylum could adopt them, Mr. Watt stated that the Commonwealth Government would use the powers it had to preserve law and order, and prevent Bolshevik excesses ; if necessary, it would go even to the length of deportation. The Government looked for strength in the community to put clown the illicit exercise of force. He ventured to think that the great heart of Australia would remain sound.Resettlement of Returned Soldiers. The State of Victoria has purchased up to the present date 86,706 acres of land for 1,092,563L for the purpose of the resettlement of returned soldiers.Influenza. The influenza epidemic has spread to many parts of New South AVales and South Australia. The New South Wales Government are closing the theatres and cinematographs, prohibiting racing throughout the whole State, and enforcing the wearing of masks in hotels and churches.SOUTH AFRICA.Events of the Strike. The Conference which was held at Johannesburg on March 31st between the Town Council and the Strike Committee resulted in a dead-lock, the Council refusing to rescind their resolution of March 28th ordering the dismissal of 30 men employed at the municipal power station.The General Purposes Committee and the Tramway Committee of the Town Qouncil subsequently resolved that in view of the stoppage of the municipal service and possible interference with the water and sanitary services, the decision to dismiss 30 men employed at the municipal power station be inoperative pending Government action dealing with the municipal position in Johannesburg.A meeting of the Municipal Employees&apos; Association then decided by a large majority in favour of an immediate strike. A guarantee was given that the water and sanitary services could be maintained. The Federation of Trades which supported the strikers submitted demands to the Town Council calling for the immediate rescission of the Counciks decision to dismiss 30 men employed at the municipal&apos;power station and for the resignation of the Council, adding that if the Council agreed the strikers would return to work. The strikers proposed on March 31st the formation of a Board of Control acting in conjunction with the
o-eneral manager of the power station and tramways and disregarding the Town Council entirely.   They announced that all services would he running the next day.The proposal to form a Strikers&apos; Board of Control to act in co-operation with the o-eneral manager of the power station and tramways and in disregard of the Town Council was duly carried put, and the Board issued a manifesto to the effect that the Joint Strike Committee &quot; being anxious to save the public from any inconvenience and with a desire to serve the best interests of the community,&quot; had decided, until the Town Council conceded its demands, to assume control and resume all the municipal services. -Mr. Bain, one of the deportees of 1914, as Chairman of the Strike Committee, addressed the strikers in the Town Hall on April 1st, and said that the provisional Board of Control would retain in their positions the heads of the municipal depart-ments who were willing to give loyal service, while those who refused would be relieved of their posts. The first act of the Board, he added, would be to rescind the resolution which the Town CounciL had refused to rescind, and to reinstate the men. The different departments would appoint departmental Boards of Control, and these in their turn would meet and appoint a general board of 21 members co-ordinating the activities of the whole and &quot; acting in the position which the Towm Councdlors formerly occupied.&quot; Thirteen heads of departments informed the Board that they were municipal employees and consequentPy could not place their services at the disposal of the Board.   Many other municipal employees came to a similar decision.The Board telegraphed to the Acting Prime Minister stating that it was carrying-on the services in the interests of the community and was inviting the co-operation of the Councillors.The main body of the municipal employees, while admitting allegiance to their Association, which was co-operating with the leaders of the strike, refused to recognise the authority of the strikers&apos; Board of Control. The employees in the offices refused to work, but the tramway men ran a full service. The Mayor issued a statement, declining to recognise the Board of Control.On the arrival of the Minister of Justice (Mr. Be Wet) and the Acting Minister of Defence (Colonel Mentz) at Johannesburg, they met the magistrate, then the Executive of the South African Party and the Town Council.The municipal strike was subsecjuently reported as settled on the initiative of the Administrator of the Transvaal. A number of the Town Councillors thereupon resigned, one of them, in a statement to the Press, giving as a reason that the wall of the majority no longer prevailed, and that a new authority had arisen which he was not prepared to recognise.Native Unrest.-The native position was reported as becoming more serious on April 3rd, but was stated to be quiet on April 7th. Reuters Agency telegraphed that the authorities had decided to arrest the ringleaders and groups of natives visiting the town stores who were gradually rounded up. A number of responsible chiefs in Johannesburg went into the questions agitating the native mind, and condemned the movement to resist the Pass laws. -After several isolated disturbances had taken place, the situation became quieter owing to vigorous police measures.Enemy Aliens. -The third clay&apos;s debate on the second reading of the Enemy Repatriation Bill resulted in an all-night sitting on April 4th.The Acting Prime Minister (Mr. Malan) early in the afternoon intimated that a division would be taken before the House rose. The Nationalists offered a deter-mined opposition, and talked freely of continuing the debate until Saturdav midnight. Ultimately Mr. Malan moved the closure at half-past 6 o&apos;clock on the morning of April 5th, which was carried&apos;by 62 votes to 20.The Bill was then read a second time and referred to a Select Committee.Woman Suffrage. A motion (proposed by Mr. Wyndham) in favour of woman suffrage has been carried in the Union House of Assembly by 44 votes to 42. The minority consisted mainly of members of the South African Party and Nationalists. Mr. J. X. Merriman and Mr. Van Heerclen were amongst the opposers of the motion.Railway Management. Pn the Union House of Assembly on March 25th, the Leader of the Labour Party (Colonel Creswell) moved a resolution in favour of reconstituting the Railway Board which should, he said, consist of an equal number of  Government   nominees   and   railway   servants.     The  Minister  of Railways77S6-2a. B
(Mi-. Burton) deelinecklo accept the motion which he declared meant giving 35,000 Tailway -employees equal representation writh all the rest of &quot;the community&apos;-, .JHe announced the establishment of a Conciliation-Board to deal-with the questions of hours and pay-and cognate matters, and referred to the recent developments in Great Britain in a similar direction. The Minister also quoted a British Labour journal as saying that partial control of the services was insufficient, and that the Trade Unions wanted exclusive control. Mr. Burton declared emphatically that such a proposal would mean ruin and disaster. If Democracy meant anything, lie continued, it meant the rule of the majority, and if that were denied there would be no alternative to brute force.Air. Patrick Duncan advocated a policy of co-operation before difficulties arose instead of conciliation after they had arisen, and he moved an amendment in favour of the establishment of an Advisory&apos;Council to advise on all questions regarding pay, hours, conditions of labour and kindred matters affecting the working of the railway and harbour services, such Council to consist of an equal number of Government nominees and Government servants.The debate was adjourned.INDIA.Riots at Delhi. The Viceroy informed the Secretary of State by telegram, dated March 31st, that some rioting had occurred at Delhi on Sunday, 30th March. Many shops were closed in sympathy with the passive resistance movement against the Rowlatt Bills, and some of the mob entered the railway station with the object of compelling sweatmeat sellers to stop business. The station staff failed to eject the mob. The police were called for and arrested one man, who was forcibly rescued outside the station. The mob then stoned the police, and the military had to be sent for. Owing- to the threatening- attitude of the mob the military were compelled to fire in Queeiks Gardens, and again somewhat later on in the day near the Clock Tower in Chandni Chowk. The total casualties, as far as can be ascertained, were five, or possibly six, killed, and sixteen others wounded and now- in hospital. All was quiet on Monday morning, though large &quot;crowds remained in the streets. Most of the shops, except those in Chandni Chowk, and the large bazaars have re-opened. The military remain on duty in the city.Delhi is now reported to be quiet, and there are no reports of trouble elsewhere.Legislation on Sedition Committee Report.

OTHER COLONIES, PROTECTORATES, &amp;c.EGYPT.Progress of Events. Early on the morning of April 2nd the cadets of the Military School of the Egyptian Army marched out of the School leaving their arms and equipment behind them. A number of cadets of the Police School joined them subsequently and demonstrated in front of the Sultan&apos;s palace.A detachment of Egyptian army troops under orders for service in Upper Egypt also broke barracks, taking with them their arms and equipment. These eventually all returned and proceeded to their destination. A partial strike of native Government officials began on this date&quot;.A telegram from the Sudan dated April 3rd reported that the situation might be regarded as normal there.A riot took place in Abdin Square opposite the Sultan&apos;s palace in Cairo, and was dispersed by troops, who inflicted casualties to the extent of 10 killed and 56 wounded. One British civilian official, Mr. Dykes of the Egyptian State Railways, lost his life. The strike of Government officials continued and the cadets of the Military School again made a demonstration.   The provinces were reported quiet.On April 4th fanaticism became evident and was particularly directed against the Armenians. The State telegraph employees went on strike, but the service was assured by the military as was that of the railways. The provinces were again reported quiet.On April 5th a mass meeting of Government employees decided to continue the strike, the situation in Cairo being quiet, with an undercurrent of hostility and some looting.   Renewed uneasiness was reported in the provinces.On April 7th a telegram was received to the effect that no incidents were reported in the provinces.No further reports were received up to 6 p.m. on April 8th.FOREIGN COLONIES, &amp;c. IN AFRICA.GERMAN COLONIES.Peace Conference. According to Wireless reports the German Colonial Adminis-tration will be represented at the Peace Conference by Dr. Schnee, late Governor of German East Africa, Dr. Marquardsen and Dr Ruppel. - The Colonial Minister, Dr. Bell, will take part in decisive negotiations concerning colonial questions. Senator Strandes and Director Daxenfeld will probably attend as general experts.The German Colonial Society has addressed an open letter to President Wilson in which attention is drawn to the 5th of his 14 points (a free and impartial adjustment of all colonial claims, &amp;c). The letter then proceeds to paint a glowing picture of the benefits which German Colonial Administration has conferred on the native population, and asks what other colonial power can show a similar record. Germany laid down her arms, trusting in President Wilson&apos;s good faith. Is she now to be disappointed ?
