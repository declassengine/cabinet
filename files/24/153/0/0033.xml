BRITISH   EMPIRE   AND   AFRICA  REPORT.SELF-GOVERNING   DOMINIONS.CANADA.Peace Celebrations. The Dominion Government have decided to hold general Peace celebrations throughout the country on July 19th. In publishing a circular despatch from the Colonial Office on the subject, the Government state that while they are of opinion that a later date would have been more appropriate, as war is still being waged in many countries of Europe, and the Treaty of Peace still remains to be ratified, yet in view of His Majesty&apos;s proclamation and the general desire, the date will be adopted in Canada.Preparations are being made in all the large centres of the Dominion to make the celebration a fitting one, and special efforts are being made in each locality to do honour to the part played in the war by men who enlisted in the vicinity.Work of Parliament:-Parliament was prorogued on July 7th after passing a Bill to confer oh women the right to Vote and to Sit in Parliament.During the session, 181 Bills were introduced, and approximately 150, including private Bills, became law, while a sum exceeding $834,000,000 was voted in order to cover the cost of repatriating and demobilising the army; pensions-, interest on the Public Debt and other expenditure for the fiscal year. Of this sum $350,000,000 were voted to provide funds for demobilisation and other purposes directly resulting from the War.An important feature of the session was the ResoKitioh requesting that no titles or honours, save those of a vocational or professional character , or military decorations, should be granted hereafter to Canadians. Another matter of importance was the Bill establishing Divorce Courts in the Provinces.Thanks to the Troops. Parliamentary recognition of the work of the Canadian Army was accorded when the Prime Minister (Sir Robert, Borden) moved., a resolution in the House of Commons offering thanks to the Canadian Army for their splendid achievements overseas. In moving the resolution, the Prime Minister commented on the glorious achievements of Canada&apos;s soldiers and of the thanks which were their due from the nation for gallantly in battle.The Premier then proceeded to praise the splendid work of Sir Arthur Currie. through the darkest hours and in the final flush of victory, and stated that in his opinion - no criticism could be more unjust than that recently made of the Corps Commander:The Premier then moved that the formal thanks of the House be conveyed to the Military and Naval Forces of Canada.Mr. D. D. Mackenzie, Leader of the Opposition, seconded, and the House unanimously concurred in the motion.Prohibition. Prior to the prorogation of Parliament a Prohibition Conference between the Senate and the Commons was again held, and resulted in a deadlock. It is probable that the measure will be shelved, which means that the Act will not become law, and national prohibition, covering the manufacture and importation of, and inter-Provincial trade in, liquor will end with the Peace Proclamation. The sale of liquor in Canada is purely a matter for Provincial jurisdiction.Government and Bolshevism. -The Federal authorities, continuing their intensive campaign against the spread of sedition and Bolshevism in Canada, have carried out further raids on the Labour Temple, and have also entered, the homes of 30 of Winnipeg&apos;s leading Social-Radicals, seizing a large quantity of documents, pamphlets and letters alleged to be of a revolutionary character. As a result of the evidence obtained, it is believed that further arrests will be made.Members of 13 building trades unions who were on strike for nine weeks have returned to work, and the Riot Act has been repealed. Normal conditions prevail as to parades, and mass meetings are again allowed.Pensions and Unmarried Women. A long debate took place in the House^ of Commons on the clause in the Pensions Bill providing allowances for the unmarried
wives of soldiers and tlieir offspring. THe debate finally developed into &quot;ah pbiectiorr to the. words &quot;unmarried wife&quot; as reflecting dh women who wefce legitimately married. The phrase was first-changed to &quot; wife, of habit and repute,&quot;, and finally the definitiona woman although not married to a member of the Forces, was publicly presented by him as &quot;his wife &quot;was allowed to pals.As the Bill stood for Third). Reading, the &quot; uiMarried wifewill be allowed to benefit by the pension, if her husband has made the supreme sacrifice, on the same scale as Hie legitimate wife.Industrial Relations: Unemployment. In addition-te the Majority Report already published (vide Report No. 126), the House of Commons Committee, on Industrial Relations issued a Minority Report signed by Senator Smeatoh.White and Mr. Frank Panze.   This report stated : -&quot;There does not appear- to be any serious unemployment in Canada, for though there is a considerable . number of unemployed, this condition is largely due to unequal distribution of labour.&quot;Progress of Repatriation. -With the sailing of the Carmania on Saturday with 2,495; troops, and the sailing of the Tunisian on the same day with &apos;268 troops, 255,413 Canadians have been repatriated since the date oi the Armistice.       . &apos;.&apos;The number of Canadians overseas, both in the British Isles and in France, is approximately 32,000. &apos;   -AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH.Seamen s Strike: The seanien-s strike is still continuing, and the loss in wages alone throughout Australia as a result of the strike was estimated on 23rd June to amount to 1,000,0002. :.&apos;   A   &apos; -Labour and Levy on Cajntal.-Tke Inter-State Labour Conference in Sydney on June 26th passed a resolution in favour of a graduated levy upon land and capital to enable the speedy repayment of War Loans. The Conference also -carried a resolution opposing compulsory military training.Overlapping of Income Taxes. The Acting Prime Minister (Mr. Watt) stated on July 9th that the Commonwealth Government would probably send an expert to London to assist at the Conference dealing with the overlapping of income taxes in the United Kingdom and the Dominions.Mutiny on the &quot;Australia.&quot;-Speaking in the House of Representatives on June 27th, in. re-ply to Mr. Tudor, the Opposition Labour leader, the Acting Prime Minister (Mr. Watt) said that only the British Admiralty.could review the sentences passed by court-martial in connection with the mutiny on board the flagship Australia at Fremantle. ... &apos;.The Labour News denounces the sentence as &quot;savage.&quot; &quot; Australians should demand,&quot; the paper declares, &quot; that no Australian soldier should suffer, disgrace or imprisonment as a result of court-martial in a foreign land.&quot;Natives of Nauru-A recent ballot among the natives of Nauru has resulted overwhelmingly in favour of British rule.NEW ZEALAND.National Prohibition: Final Figures. The following are the final figures for the votes taken in New Zealand on the licensing question : Civilian votes : for continuance 232,208, for prohibition 246,104. Soldiers&apos; votes : for continuance 31,981, for prohibition 7,72-3. The aggregate majority in favour of continuance amounted to 10,362 votes.SOUTH AFRICA.Peace Celebrations-Owing to the short notice received, the Union Government have found it impracticable to celebrate Peace on July 19th, but will adhere to the date already arranged, viz., August 2nd to 5th. Sunday, August 30th, will be a day of &quot; thanksgiving and prayer.&quot;Restrictions on Wool Exportation. In reply to a telegram from the Secretary of State for the Colonies the Union Ministers have informed the British Government that there are&quot;no restrictions on the exportation of wool to the United Kingdom. It is added that, although permits are required for the export of wool to British and. Allied possessions, they are issued freely to applicants.
- Diamond Gutting. In the Union House of Assembly on June 4th, the Acting-Prime Minister (Mr. Malan), replying in the debate on the Bill empowering the establishment of a diamond cutting industry in South Africa, emphasised the point that the Bill laid down that the cutter should pay the open market price for diamonds, and that the producer should not be in a worse position by selling to the local cutter than elsewhere. Mr. Malan believed that after the industry had been started a market in rough diamonds would be evolved in South Africa.. There was no reason, he declared, why there should not be a Hatton Garden in South Africa.An amendment referring the Bill to a select committee was withdrawn and the measure was read a second time. The motion to refer it to a select committee was afterwards renewed, but was negatived by the House.The Labour leader (Colonel Creswell), during the debate in the lTouse of Assembly, contended that the objections previously raised against the establishment of the industry had been exaggerated. He anticipated that the new industry would very soon be absorbed by the mining industry, and would thus constitute a virtual monopoly, whereas an opportunity should be given small men. Sir David Graaff stated that the Brighton experimental factory had convinced him of the practicability of the present enterprise, and he strongly advocated the establishment of a factory in South Africa in accordance with the ofer which had been made to the Govern-ment. He emphasised that if such an industrial enterprise was defeated then Parliament might as well root up the industrial planks of its programme.Indian Trading Licences. In the House of Assembly on June 4th the Indian Bill rjassed the third reading, including the clause proposed by Mr. Collins giving any issuing authority in any part of the Transvaal the right to refuse trading licences to Asiatics without reason assigned. This clause was retained in spite of an appeal by the Acting Prime Minister for its withdrawal.INDIA.Famine. In a telegram from the Viceroy (Revenue and Agriculture De]Dartmeut), dated 4th July, which has been received at the India Office, it was reported that, owing to the agricultural operations, the number on works had decreased in the Bankura district, Bengal, Bundelkhand Agency in Central India and in the Central Provinces. Distress in the Bhagalpur district of Bihar and Orissa showed signs of decrease, while distress in the Angul district of Bihar and Orissa and in the Etawah district of United Provinces was acute, and in the Karauli State of Rajputana it was increasing. The situation generally was unchanged in Bombay, but good rain had fallen in the affected districts of Gujarat and Deccan. also in Kathiawar. The numbers relieved were : Bengal: relief works, 7,305 ; test works, 2,456 ; gratuitous relief, 19,623. Bihar and Orissa : relief works, 3,498 ; test works, 6,079; gratuitous relief, 24,317.

It has been announced through ReuteFs agency that evidence is coming to light regarding a revolutionary organisation which was started in Kabul in 1917, by certain Indians who styled themselves &quot;The Provisional Government of India.&quot; The Indians were Obeidullah, Administrative Minister, A. H. Aziz, Assistant Administrative Minister, who comes from Kasur, and Burkatullah, the welL-known renegade. This group was later joined by Mahomad Hadlnohamad Sacli, a Turkish Colonel, who brought it into touch with other organisations, and finally with the Bolsheviks, who found the money which provided the conspirators with their opportunity.It is stated that the members of this group interfered actively in putting -Amanullah upon the throne.
