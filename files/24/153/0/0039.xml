SECRET,APPRECIATION  302 THE. ATTACHED  report No. L33.. BRITISH  EMPIRE  AND AFRICA. .Imperial Affairs. &apos;!. The suggestion that Parliamentary approval should be given to the Peace Treaty hy Resolution of both Houses has now been conveyed to all the Dominions, but the South African Ministers seem to favour procedure on the lines of the Bill submitted to the British Parliament. &apos; If the latter coursers adopted, the Bill would not be to ratify the Treaty but to empower the Government to carry out the provisions which required legislative authority.The telegrams to the Oversea Governments relating to the joint provision of an Imperial News Service deal with a matter of first rate importance to the Empire.Canada.With the practical failure of the &quot;One Big Union&quot; or revolutionary Labour programme, it may be expected that a serious effort will be made by organised labour to establish a Parliamentary Labour Party, and thus secure the adequate representation of legitimate Labour interests in the Dominion House of Commons.The National Conference on Industrial Relations which opens at Ottawa next month will have an interesting agenda before it. It will be noticed than many subjects will be discussed which are of great interest at the present moment in Great Britain.Australian Commonwealth.Some Labour representatives appear to be taking up the case of deported aliens.The telegram from the Commonwealth Ministers regarding the serious position of the meat export trade is of urgent importance. The comparison that is drawn with the exports of Argentine meat to the United Kingdom goes to show how greatly opinion in the Commonwealth is exorcised over anything which is thought to menace the consolidation of Empire trade.Negotiations are still proceeding in the protracted seamen&apos;s strike.New Zealand.The amount cf meat awaiting export is a matter of great concern to the Dominion, while the cost of storage is assuming large proportions.The lack of coal supplies is affecting industry, aud particularly the railway service.The telegram relating to Chinese labour for Samoa is important.

BRITISHEMPIREAND   AFRICA  REPORT.IMPERIAL AFFAIRS.Ratification of Peace Treaty. The British Government have informed the Governments of Canada, the Australian Commonwealth and New Zealand that the South African Government are of opinion that it would he desirable with a view to securing uniformity that suggestions should be submitted as to the form in which the Peace Treaty should receive Parliamentary approval in the Dominions. The reply of the Secretary of State for the Colonies /to the South African Government that the matter is one for local decision, but that in his opinion the best course would be to obtain approval of the Treaty by Resolution of both Houses (vide Report No. 132), is conveyed to the above mentioned Governments of the other Dominions, and it is added that it is important to bear in mind that the British Bill is not a Bill to ratify the Peace Treaty, but to empower the Government to take necessary steps to carry out&apos; those provisions of the Treaty which require legislative authority. The Secretary of State for the Colonies gives as the reason for suggesting a Resolution of both Houses that this procedure might enable ratification to take place without the delay that might be involved in obtaining Parliamentary powers for carrying out the Treaty. If the procedure by Resolution is adopted, the Secretary of State assumes that there will be no objection to His Majesty the King ratifying immediately a cable is received that the Resolution has been passed.   (Vide also under &quot; South Africa.&quot;)Imperial Neics Service. Telegrams have been sent to the Governments of the Australian Commonwealth, New Zealand and South africa regarding the arrange-ments in force since the beginning of 1917, whereby Reuters have supplemented their ordinary news service to. the Dominions by a special service on Government account. The latter service, it is pointed out, was designed to convey news of Imperial interest which in ordinary circumstances would not have been transmitted at all, or would have been sent only in a very condensed form.Recently, : it is added, negotiations have been proceeding with a view to con-tinuing this special service for a period of one year from October 1st, 1919, on similar lines to those in force during the war, ancl Reuters have suggested a scheme whereby special news service would be sent on Government account (a) to the Mediterranean and Eastern Colonies, .(b) to South and East Africa ancl to West Africa in a condensed form,(c) to Australia and New Zealand.* This special service would be supplied to newspapers free of cost, and would be in addition to the regular ReuteFs service. The total cost of the proposed services on the three routes would be about 9,300L per annum, and the British Government intimate that they would be prepared to pay part of this cost, but wish to ascertain whether the other Governments interested would be willing to contribute to the cost of the special service on the particular route with which they are concerned.SELF-GOVERNING   DOMINIONS.CANADA.Ministers, Leader of Opposition and Parliament. Dr. S. F. Tohnie, has been sworn in as Minister of Agriculture. It is believed that Dr. Tolmie, Sir Henry Drayton, and Mr. Alackenzie King will not be able to occupy seats in Parliament during the Session that opens on September 1st.1 The officers administering the Governments of East and West and Central Africa and Hong Kong have received similar telegrams, and also the Governors of Ceylon, Straits Settlements, Federated Malay-States, Gibraltar and Malta.
Labour Situation: One Big Union. In a recent statement upon the Labour situation, the Minister of Labour (Senator Robertson) said the Government were determined to destroy the influences working to overthrow industry and confiscate property, and were backing the international unions which believe in the sanctity of contract. &quot; We are prepared to see labour built up through the international unions, so as to make labour an asset, not a menace.&quot; Senator Robertson expressed the con-viction that the eight-hour day was coming, and declared that now the failure of the One Big Union movement was in sight greater attention should be paid to the need of Labour representation in the. Dominion House of Commons.In a joint statement issued by the Calgary Fuel Commissioner, Mr. Armstrong, the mine oj)erators and officials of the district, and IS mine workers, the &quot; One Big Union &quot; is held to be illegal under the Criminal Code of Canada, which declares it to be an offence to support any movement having for its object the overthrow- of constituted authority. By the orders of the Fuel Commissioner, 16 mines in the district were opened on August 16th to workers willing to accept the authority of the International Union.On August I5th, a mass meeting of miners in the Crow&apos;s Nest Pass mining district of British Columbia voted by a large majority to dissolve the &quot; One Big-Union,&quot; and to reorganise under the United Mine Workers of America.At Vancouver the local unions and the international longshoremen, shipwrights, pressmen, and press-feeders voted in favour of resigning from the &quot; One Big Union.&quot;Winnipeg Labour Leaders. After a trial extending over three and a half weeks the Crown has completed the preliminary hearing of the case against the eight Winnipeg Labour leaders charged with seditious conspiracy. The accused were committed for trial at the October Assizes.Among the evidence presented by the prosecuting Attorney was a number of extracts from notes taken in a raid at the house of the Rev. Mr. Ivens. In these notes it is contended that the Government through the AVar-Time Election Act had &quot; set the pace of lawlessness,&quot; that constitutional government was no longer possible, and that government by Orders in Council was a travesty of democracy.&quot; Still the workers cling to constitutional reform. This in spite of the fact that the capitalists control the military and use them against the worker. Tke only alternative is revolution, by any means necessary, bloody or bloodless.&quot;Further interesting extracts from the minutes of the Central Strike Committee Avere read. Other letters indicated that the &quot; One Big Union&quot; was not considered so much the basis of a labour organisation as a means of securing the control of industries.Industrial relations. The recommendations of the Royal Commission on Industrial Relations for a national conference in Ottawa of Federal and Provincial Ministers with representative employers and workmen on the subject of industrial relations has been accepted by an Order in Council, which outlines also the basis of representation, the proposed form of procedure, and the objects in view.The conference sessions will be held in the House of Commons Chamber, beginning on September 15th, and will probably continue for about a week.The following is the proposed agenda : 1. Consideration of the question of the desirability of unifying and co-ordinating the existing labour laws of the Dominion Parliament and of the Provincial Legislatures ; and the consideration of any new labour laws which are deemed necessary.2. Consideration of (a) employees&apos; right to organise; (o) recognition of labour unions ; (c) the right of employees to collective bargaining.3. Consideration of (a) the recommendations of the Royal Commission on Industrial Relations in favour of the establishment of a Bureau to promote the establishment and development of joint industrial councils ; (b) the further recommendations of the Royal Commission on Industrial Relations regarding the establishment of joint plant and industrial councils.4. Consideration of the recommendations of the Royal Commission respecting hours of labour.5. Consideration of minimum wage laws. *6. Consideration of the recommendations of the Royal Commission that the findings of the Commission be put into effect in all work controlled by the Government wkere the principle of democratic management can be applied.S709-3a A 2
7. Consideration of resolutions relating to any other features of the report ofthe Royal Commission on Industrial Relations. 8. Consideration of the labour features of the Treaty of Peace. 9. Consideration of any other proposals which may be introduced bearing onthe relations of employers and employees.1 Grand Trunk Railway. The Director of Information at Ottawa reported on August 14th that it was expected that negotiations between the Chairman of the Grand Trunk Railway Company and the Dominion Government regarding the final disposition of the system would be renewed in a few days.Exportable Wheat. The Director of Information reported on August 14th that the adverse Western crop conditions would keep down Canada&apos;s exportable surplus of wheat to probably 100,000,000 bushels.Vocational Training.  The Director of Information at Ottawa states that the United States Federal Board for Vocational Training reports that for vocational work for returned soldiers Canada has voted over two dollars for every one provided by the United States.AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH.Deported Aliens : Labour Demand. In the House of Representatives on August 16th in the course of an animated debate several Labour Members demanded an open trial for deported aliens.Serious Position of Meat Export Trade. The Acting Prime Minister of the Commonwealth has informed the British Government that the Australian Government view with alarm the desperate position into which the meat export trade is fast falling owing to inadequate refrigerated space being made available. Unless immediate drastic action is taken, it is stated that, disastrous results must follow.It is added that inquiry shows that whilst the Argentine has exported to the United Kingdom for the six months ended June 30th last frozen beef and mutton valued at over 12,000,000Z., Australian shipping of frozen beef and mutton was valued at less than 1,500,000Z. In view of the debates in the Imperial Conference regarding the consolidation of Empire trade and the Tariff preference given by Australia to the goods of the United Kingdom, it is inexplicable to the Government and people of the Commonwealth how it is possible for a South American Republic to send enormous supplies whilst vessels cannot be spared for Australia&apos;s meat. By way Of example it is mentioned that it is anticipated in Victoria alone 2,000,000 sheep and lambs will be slaughtered, the vast majority before&apos;December; and it is stated to be imperative that early relief be afforded to all the States of the Commonwealth.Shipping for A23ple Crop. The Commonwealth Government have telegraphed to the British Government stating that they would appreciate early consideration being-given to the question of providing shipping space for next season&apos;s apple crop.Seamen s Strike.-Th.ou.gh it was reported on August&apos; 14th that the Sydney , seamen had rescinded the Resolution regarding the release of Mr. Walsh (vide &apos; Report No. 131) and declared that the strike should end on the terms suggested in July, matters assumed a more serious aspect on August 17th, when the Sydney seamen, at a mass meeting, rescinded their previous decisions and notified the Minister for Repatriation (Senator Milieu), representing the Government, that they would not return to work unless they were specifically assured that the questions at issue would not be referred to the Arbitration Court.On August 18th Senator Millen stated that negotiations were still proceeding -with the seamen for a settlement.New South Wales Government Policy. The Premier of New South Wales (Mr. Holman) in a speech to the Nationalist Party defining his policy, said that it embraced the development of railway-s, irri nation works, soldier settlements,. anti-monopoly legislation on the basis of the American Sherman Act, the curtailment of -profiteering by fixing wholesale prices, the establishment of maternity hospitals and Test homes, the introduction of Whitlej7 Councils, and the promotion of profit-sharing and co-partnership.
NEW ZEALAND.Meat Awaiting Shipment:. Serious Position. The Prime Minister (Mr. Massey) has called the attention of the British Government to the seriousness of the position, both for New Zealand producers and the British Government, arising from the accumulation of approximately 8,000,000 sixty-pound weight carcases of meat awaiting shipment in the freezing stores of the Dominion. He points out that the rate for storage is probably amounting to l,O0O,000Z. per annum ; and he recpiests that an energetic effort be made to reduce the stocks before the season commences, about November 1st next.Goal Supplies. The Dominion Government have &apos; informed the British Government that a very serious difficulty exists in New Zealand regarding coal supplies, owing partly to strikes and partly to scarcity of shipping, and it has become necessary to cut down the railway services by more than one half. As the Prime Minister (Mr. Massey) has been informed that the British Ministry of Shipping have refused to allow ships under their control to be used for carrying coal from Australia to New Zealand, the New Zealand GoA^ernment would be glad, in view of the serious position, if the Shipping Controller wordd reconsider his&apos; decision.      *Labour for Samoa. Owing to the difficulty as to the provision of Chinese labour for the Samoan Islands arising from the action of the Chinese Government, the Prime Minister (Mr. Massey) has suggested that, if the British Government concur, repre-sentations should be made to the Chinese Government suggesting the course indicated in a previous telegram, viz., indenture for three years with repatriation at the end of that period. It is pointed out that some of the Chinese labour at present in the islands will be repatriated this year, and the same ship which conveys them to China could be utilised for bringing back a fresh contingent.SOUTH AFRICA.Ratification of Peace Treaty : Meeting of Parliament. -The Secretary of State for the Colonies has telegraphed to the Union Government expressing regret that it has not been found possible to convene the Union Parliament as soon as had been expected from a previous telegram. It is pointed out that severe pressure is being put upon the British Government from Paris to ratify &quot;the Treaty at the earliest possible date and French ratification is expected on September 2nd or. 3rd. The hope is expressed that procedure by joint Resolution will be adopted in order to avoid delay.In reply, the Union Government express regret that it was not found possible to convene Parliament before September 5th. The Ministers agree to adopt all necessary measures to expedite procedure, but tirey express a doubt as to whether it would be good policy to submit a Resolution for the purpose instead of proceeding by way of a Bill on the lines of the Imperial Act.British- Parliament and Domestic Affairs of Union : Generals Botha and Smuts.  At a dinner given in Johannesburg on August 14th, General Botha paid a high tribute to the British Navy and the Empire&apos;s sacrifices in the war. He declared that he had returned to South Africa animated with the sole object of establishing larger co-operation and strengthening and maintaining the constitution. All talk of the British Parliament interfering in South Africans domestic affairs was, he said, unadulterated nonsense. Incidentally, General Botha remarked that .the&apos; services performed by women in the war would, it seemed to him, compel the men to give them the franchise.General Smuts spoke upon the spirit of the British Empire, in which, he declared, the real greatness of Britain&apos;s war effort consisted. The Empire&apos;s aim, he said, was to achieve victory for certain principles and ideals. Such was the spirit in which the Empire had dealt with South Africa that even General Hertzog had acknowledged that, Great Britain had in no manner interfered in the administration of the Uniorf. It was in the same spirit that the Union Government had declined the Imperial Government^ offer of 30,000 troops to quell the rebellion in 1914, because freedom begat responsibility. He believed that South Africass -conduct during the war had done more for the ideals of liberty and freedom than, perhaps, anything in the whole ^rar. The wise people of the world were profoundly surprised at this achievement of British rule, which had formed a great precedent.
Position of Parties: General Election Prospects. The Free State Provincial Congress of the South African Party will open at Bloemfontein on August 20th, and General Botha, General Smuts, and Mr. Malan will attend.The Gape Times Bloemfontein correspondent indicates that new developments in the relationship between the South African Party and the Unionists will be announced. ReutePs correspondent telegraphs from Pretoria that the political situation is developing in interest with the return of General Botha and General Smuts, and there is a prospect of a General Election early in 1920. In view of the possibility of the Ministerial or South African. Party not obtaining a clear majority,, the alternatives of a reunion with the Nationalists or a coalition with the Unionists against, the disruptive aims of the former are being widely discussed. While, however, the parties may at present be regarded to a certain extent as in a state of flux, and it is impossible to foretell what working combinations will be required to carry on the administration after the elections, ReuteFs correspondent is reliably informed that the South African Party still occupies the general position which it took up at the last General Election, and that therefore it goes to the polls entirely on its own recognisances, asking for a clear mandate to govern independently.Other current talk.concerns the absorption of Rhodesia and Swaziland into the Union. *INDIA.Famine. The Viceroy telegraphed to the India Office on August 15th that famine had been declared in Palur, Biridi llumma and Ronabha estates, and in the Chatrapur subdivision of Ganjam district, Madras Presidency. Relief works in Gungarpur Native. States of Rajputana and test works in Merwara had been closed, and cheap grain shop relief in the Akola district of the Central Provinces had stopped. Distress in the United Provinces had greatly diminished and was decreasing in Bengal. The condition of cattle in Bombay had much improved. The numbers relieved were as follows :  Bengal : relief works, 4,001 ; test works, 83 ; gratuitous relief, 19,505. Bihar and Orissa: relief-works, 1,193; test works, 3,660; gratuitous relief, 44,305. Feudatory States of Orissa: test works, 7,330; gratuitous relief, 28,359., United Provinces: test works, 675 ; gratuitous relief, 13,012. Rajputana: test works, 362 ; gratuitous-relief, 75.
