SECRET.APPRECIATION: Ok THE ATTACHED REPORT. No. lOli.BRITISH  EMPIRE  AND AFRICA.Canada.The Quebec criticism that neither the mover nor the seconder of the Address will be a French-Canadian is hardly to. the point, having regard to the fact that there is only one entirely French-Canadian supporter&apos; of the Government in Parliament, and he seconded the Address last year.The alien question is receiving considerable attention in industrial centres, and there is evidently a strong feeling, particularly amongst returned soldiers, in favour of the immediate deportation of undesirable aliens.The scheme of the Canadian Pacific Railway for establishing farms in the West, on the community settlement plan, should enable many returned soldiers to take up farming with expert assistance.It is clear that total prohibition is not favoured by the general body of Canadian labour. The point raised as to the influence of the policy upon immigration is interesting.The importance of social hygiene is being thororighly realised, and the establish-ment of a Federal Board of Health may be the outcome.Australian Commonwealth.*Mr. Hughes&apos; action regarding the Pacific Islands is approved by the National Labour Party, which represents the labour section of the National Party. On the other hand the Official Labour Party, who constitute the official Opposition, have expressed themselves in favour of direct control and administration by the League of Nations.   The Press views on the subject show some divergence.There is still a stroug feeling being manifested in favour of an indemnity from enemy countries.Having regard to the rumours on the subject of the Leadership of the National Party, it is well that Mr. Watt has emphasised his intention of giving Mr. Hughes his entire support.The Commonwealth Cabinet are co-operating with the States in regard to public health.South Africa.It is interesting to note the desire of South African Ministers to receive a visit from the British naval squadron which is expected to visit Australia. [p.t.o.
The Government, have accepted the Opposition view as to the treatment of returned soldiers.In his latest speech, General Hertzog has probably exceeded his most violent utterances in advocating disruption Of the Union.It is natural that the Nationalists should endeavour to make the most out of the mandatory principle as applied to German South-West Africa.The question of South Africans in London awaiting passages has been raised in Parliament.India.(Excluding External Affairs.)The views expressed at the Conference of Ruling Princes regarding the Reform proposals should receive attention.H. d&apos;E.February 13th, 1919.

BRITISH  EMPIRE   AND   AFRICA  REPORT.IMPERIAL AFFAIRS.British Empire Delegation. At a meeting of the British Empire Delegation (B.E.D. 5) on January 28th the Mandatory system was discussed, particularly in relation to the applicability of the system in the Pacific.At a meeting of the British Empire Delegation (B.E.D. 7), held on February 7th, the question of the renewal of the Armistice and a further disarmament of Germany was discussed. The work of the Commissions was also referred to, and it was indicated that the Commissioners would not have their work completed for at least three weeks. Amongst other matters discussed were the future of Constantinople, the occupation of Syria, and the question of General Malleson&apos;s withdrawal from Transcaucasia.SELF-GOVERNING   DOMINIONS.CANADA.Meeting of Parliament. At the meeting of Parliament on February 20th, returned soldiers will move and second the Address in reply to the Speech from the Throne. The Quebec newspapers are complaining that neither the mover nor seconder of the Address will be a French Canadian.The Alien Question. The alien question is causing some unrest in several industrial centres in the Dominion and the Government have issued a statement on the subject. The statement points out that 2,200 prisoners of alien enemy nationality were interned in various camps, and of these 1,700 were Germans. Under an arrangement with the British Government 100 of these will be deported immediately, but the remainder will probabh^ have to be kept in Canada until the Peace Treaty is signed and the status of the alien is established. Meanwhile many aliens employed in the various industries of the Gountry are anxious to return to their homes and are willing to pay their own passages if they are allowed to go. Lack of shipping accommodation, however, as well as the fact that passports to enter their own land are hard to obtain, create a difficulty in this respect.The Minister of Labour (Senator Robertson) referred to the alien problem in a speech at Hamilton last week in the following terms :-&quot;What are we going to do with the alien enemies and workmen here of alien birth who have been engaged on lucrative employment while our men were in France? It is absolutely necessary that we should have had this labour, or else wo should not have obtained the shells that were needed. But this is no longer necessary, and I would respectfully and emphatically urge every emploj^er to fill the places of these men with returned soldiers.&quot;Labour Conditions. The Minister of Labour, in the speech referred to in the preceding paragraph, declared that there are fewer persons unemployed in Canada at the present time than during the winter of 1914-15.   The Minister added that
there was no need for alarm at the existing conditions, and that only the co-operation of the public was needed to restore the labour market to the normal. There was a great demand for labour in British Columbia and the other Western Provinces, and only in Ontario and Quebec was the situation at all pressing.Canadian Pacific Railway and. Scheme for Returned Soldiers. The President of the Canadian Pacific Railway (Mr. Beatty) has made an important statement regarding the plans of the Company for assisting in the work of reconstruction, particularly in relation to. returned soldiers. After stating that the company&apos;s steamships had carried 1,000,000 troops to the various theatres of war, had transported over 4,000,000 tons of freight, and had sent over 10,000 employees into the service, the President proceeded to say that now the purely war activities had ended the Company had decided to turn its attention to the problem of assisting the returned soldier. The first duty, of course, was to transport him quickly and comfortabh&apos; and as safely as possible to his home. The second duty was to absorb back into the system all the former emplojTees who went overseas, and were willing and able to resume their duties, and also to provide employment for as many other returned men as possible. Hie third duty was to adapt as much of the Company&apos;s land as could be made available for settlement purposes for the returned men.The Company was, he said, considering plans for the establishment of a large number of farms on the community settlement idea, if it were feasible to do so, in the Provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan. A start had already been made, and a number of farms of 160 acres each had been grouped in communities and prepared so that returned soldiers who wished to take up farming&apos;.might commence work under expert supervision.Under this plan the settler Avould be given a house of four or five rooms, together with a barn large enough to house eight or ten head of stock, as well as a pump. The land would be all wire fenced, and made read\* for cultivation. The plan involved an expenditure of S3,500,000.-Labour and Modification of Prohibition. A plea in favour of stronger beer for Canada was made to members of the Government last week by a delegation of Labour representatives, headed by the President of the Dominion Trades and Labour Congress (Mr. Moore).The delegation presented some 1,500 resolutions passed by that number of Labour Councils out of the 1.900 which exist in Canada at the present time. This, the delegation pointed out, was proof that total prohibition did not represent the thoughts and desires of the great mass of the workers in Canada.The Government wore requested to remove the existing restrictions relating to the manufacture and sale of beer, the Labour representatives contending that the Orders-in-Council embodying them were passed as a Avar measure, and not on their merits as social legislation. Another feature emphasised by the delegation was that thousands of men engaged in the brewing and allied industries had been thrown out of work at a time when it was difficult to assimilate them in other manufacturing industries.The recent action of the British GoArernment in acceding to the demands of the British workers for stronger beer involved, it was submitted, similar action on the Canadian side of the Atlantic, if Canada was to attract British immigration in future instead of undesirable aliens. Unless palatable beer Avas allowed to be manufactured and sold, the delegation declared that immigrants would be attracted to Australia, where prohibition Avas not in vogue.The Government, which was represented by Sir Thomas White, Messrs. F. B. Carvel I, J. A. Oalcler, and Senator Gideon Robertson, promised to give consideration to the representations.Representatives of organised Labour in the Province of Quebec Avaited upon the Premier (Sir Lomer Gouin) asking that the Provincial Temperance Act be amended so as to. allow standard beer, containing 6 per cent, of alcohol, to be brewed after May 1st, on which date prohibition comes into force. They also declared in favour of permitting the sale of wines, saying that Avhile it Avas not in much demand by working men, other people apparently desired it. The President of the Montreal Trades and Labour Council stated that prohibition would.have a big effect upon labour, as from 10,000 to 12,000 people were engaged in brewing and its auxiliary trades in the Province.
The Provincial Treasurer explained that brewing in Canada was absolutely forbidden by the prohibition legislation of the Federal Government. He promised art active programme of public works, including road construction, in order to relieve the unemployment problem.Federal Board of Health. The first step towards the establishment of a social hygiene programme was taken when representatives of a number of Provinces met in the Capital at the invitation of the Department of Militia to discuss legislation designed to control venereal diseases in Canada. The delegates passed a number of resolutions, the subject of which will be communicated to the Government placing themselves on record as favouring the establishment of a Federal Board of Health.Another resolution was in favour of the compulsory notification of venereal diseases, compulsory and standardised treatment, authority to examine persons suspected of the disease, and the prevention of quack treatment and remedies.The delegates also advocated an amendment of the criminal code so that a person suffering from any form of venereal disease in a communicable form, who knowingly or by culpable negligence communicates it to others, shall be guilty of a criminal offence.Minimum Wage. An attempt will be made by private members in the coining session of Parliament to secure the passage of a resolution for the establishment of a Minimum Wage Board in conjunction with the Department of Labour. It is sought to have a standard fixed for the cost of living below which no system of remuneration should compel people to live, and that no cheapness of labour or of labourers&apos; products elsewhere should be allowed to interfere with home conditions.A Bill to provide a minimum wage for women was introduced in the Quebec Legislature by the Government last week and given its first reading. The measure does not fix a standard for the various classes, but provides for the appointment of commissions to fix wages when representations are made to the Government calling attention to unsatisfactory conditions.AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH.Pacific Islands. The Executive of the National Labour Party in Melbourne has decided to place on record its admiration and appreciation of Mr. Hughes for his courageous stand for Australians rights at the Peace Conference, in that this advocacy has fully justified the confidence placed in him by the Australian people to represent them at the greatest conference ever hold in the world&apos;s history.Hie Directors of the Australian Natives&apos; Association in Sydney have passed a resolution congratulating Mr. Hughes on his stand with reference to the Pacific Islands.The Secretary of the Executive of the Official Labour Party has sent the following cable to President Wilson and Mr. Arthur Henderson : &quot; The Australian Labour movement views with alarm any departure from its expressed opinion that the captured Pacific Islands should be placed under international control, and administered direct by the League of Nations.&quot;The subject of the Pacific Islands continues to be discussed in the Common-wealth Press.The Sydney Herald says that, now that a compromise has been accepted^ Mr. Hughes&apos; influence may well, be used for the purpose of providing the League of Nations with a force which will make its mandatories safe.The Melbourne Age is of the opinion that the Empire and not Australia should be the mandatory nation to be in charge of the captured German colonies in the Pacific, and that it would be a calamity if they were ever given to Australia as a gift.The Melbourne Argus says that a mistake has been made in deciding upon the .mandatory system&quot;before the League of Nations is constituted.Indemnity from Enemy Countries. In the course of the Premiers&apos; Conference held at Melbourne last week, the Premier of South Australia (Mr. A. H. Peake) moved that &quot;in the opinion of the Premiers and Ministers now sitting in Conference, the
:-.   ::- .;-&apos;-       ^Na-;^^ W&apos;:        v&apos;. &apos;   &apos;Commonwealth is justly entitled to be indemnified by enemy countries of the monetary cost which the people of Australia have to bear by reason of war.&quot; Mr. Peake said he could not conceive anyone in the Conference holding the opinion that Australia should carry this cost and not claim to be reimbursed as other cotintries of the world had done- He did not suppose that Germany and Austria would be able to. meet the demands made upon them in hard cash at present, but he thought they could anticipate a time when Germany would regain a good deal of its trading power and would be able from its own resources to meet the claims.The Premier of Tasmania (Mr. Lee) seconded the motion, and said it was only fair that Australia should be compensated as far as possible for its losses. He was very pleased to see the fight put ,up by the Prime - Minister, Mr. Hughes, in this matter. He&apos; thought Australia owed a debt of gratitude to Mr. Hughes for the dominant note struck so; far as Imperialism was concerned ; also for his claim that Germany should be punished for its crimes.The Acting Prime Minister (Mr. Watt) said he thoroughly approved of the proposal. Mr. Hughes, with the full concurrence of the Federal Cabinet, had been pronouncing upon this matter in perfectly definite terms in the British War Cabinet, and amongst the Allied statesmen whom he had been privileged to meet, so that Australia^ claim should: be put in its proper place. The motion was carried unanimously.Labour Party and&apos; Bolsheviks. A report which has been published by the Australian Labour Party says that the sympathy of all fair-minded people must go out to the Russians in their struggle to throw off the yoke of capitalism, and that in the near future an extension Of the citizen-governed area, perhaps&quot; embracing all Europe, may be looked for.Leadership of National Party. Dealing with a remark of a Member of Parliament that the Acting Prime Minister (Mr. Watt) might replace Mr. Hughes as Leader of the National Party, Mr. Watt has issued a&apos;statement in which occurs the-following passage:- &quot;I accepted the temporary responsibilities of Acting Prime Minister at the recpiest of the Prime Minister and other members of the Cabinet. I would not be making this statement to-day but for the reason that I desire to make it perfectly clear that no question of any change in the leadership of the National Party has arisen during the absence of Mr. Hughes, and if it should arise I am not an aspirant for that position. Whatever some other folk may be thinking or hoping, I want to put them right by stating emphatically that when Mr. Hughes returns he will get from me assistance and not competition.&quot;Public Health Measures. The Federal Cabinet have decided to submit a scheme to the States for co-operation relating to public health on the American system ; the Federal Government providing means for the investigation of causes of diseases and for the prevention of death, with measures for subsidising the States&apos; efforts towards the eradication, of disease and co-ordinated measures generally in the interest of public health.Repatriation : Land for British Soldiers. The Sub-Conference of State Ministers for Lands and Works has presented to the Conference of Commonwealth and States&apos; Ministers a report showing that the States require 14,171,306Z. to cover land resumptions and works for opening up fresh holdings ; 1,192,5007. for advances to men already settled, and 21.100,625Z. for future advances at the rate of 625Z. for each settler for 35,500 holdings. The Commonwealth Government have agreed partially to recoup the States for losses.Mr. Watt, Acting Prime Minister, said he hoped special efforts would be made by Western Australia and Queensland to settle on their lands British soldiers desirous of emigrating to Australia. They shotdd advertise what they are prepared to do in order to attract surplus population.Departure of Senator Pearce for London. Senator Pearce left Melbourne on January 25th by the S.S. Marathon bound for London.Gold Production. Replying to a deputation from the Inter-State Conference on Gold-mining, the Acting Prime Minister (Mr. Watt) indicated that he was prepared to allow the export of gold, with safeguards against enemy countries.   A Renter7378-2a B
message adds that Mr. Watt stated that he was prepared experimentally to permit the export of gold for three months to enable them to test outside markets, though -certain restrictions would be necessary. He could not allow the banks to export sold because their circumstances were different.Influenza Epidemic : Compulsory Measures. As a safeguard against the influenza epidemic, the Cabinet of New South Wales have decided to make the wearing of masks compulsory.   The Australian Press reports of last week indicated that 700,000 .masks had to be prepared. before February 10th, after which date .persons without masks would be liable to arrest.Contrary to the decision of the Commonwealth Government, the New South Wales Government are stated in the Press to have established police patrols along the border to prevent overland passengers from the State of Victoria entering New South Wales. The Federal Director of Quarantine states that this action has raised serious issues.SOUTH AFRICA.Visit of British Squadron. In the House of Assembly on January 30th, the Acting Prime Minister (Mr. Malan) announced that a cable would be sent to the Imperial Government inviting the British Naval Squadron to visit South Africa on its way to Australia (vide Report No. 100).The cable to which reference was made in the House of Assembly was despatched to the British Government on February 5th, and called attention to the Press reports that a British Naval Squadron would shortly visit Australia. It was pointed out that the Union Ministers had no official information on the matter, but they trusted that . it would be possible to arrange for the squadron to visit South Africa either on the way to Australia or on the return journey. Such a visit, it was. added, would be welcomed by the people of the Union, who entirely recognised the great part taken by the Navy in bringing about the victory of the Allies.Soldiers&apos; Services in the War. In the Union House of Assembly on January 31st the debate was resumed on the motion of Sir Thomas Smartt in favour of a Select Committee to enquire into the services rendered by South Africans during the war and to make recommendations, especially with reference to enrolment, pay, discharge, pensions, vocational training, &amp;c. (vide Report No. 105).The Minister for Finance (Mr. Orr) announced that the Government accepted Sir Thomas SmartPs motion, together with the amendment of Mr. Ham man (Ministerialist) to include in any pensions scheme all those who had been wounded in previous wars, within the boundaries of the Union. Air. Orr urged that the whole question of returned soldiers should be dealt with as a solemn national duty and not in the light of party politics. The Minister of Defence (Colonel Alentz) stated that the Com-missioner for Returned Soldiers recommended a Government grant of 5.000Z. as a subsidy for vocational training. He announced that 600 returned, soldiers had been settled on the land up to December 31st last. * Eventually the motion, with Mr. Hamman&apos;s amendment, was adopted, after the amendment by the Labour Leader (Colonel Creswell) had been rejected and other amendments withdrawn.General Hertzog and Disruption of the Union.-Speaking at a demonstration in honour of the delegation to Europe (which has now arranged to leave by the Durham: Castle on February loth), General Hertzog is reported to have said : &quot; The South African Party is passing resolutions against a break up of the Union. Why ? Becairse the Union is represented as being the salvation of South Africa. It is true that if the path we are pursuing leads to success the Union will be broken up ; but which do you prefer ? Union with dependence on Great Britain, or separate Colonies with freedom &apos;? Give me freedom, and I will soon enough give you back unity again.&quot;Nationalists and Mandatory Principle. The leading Nationalist newspaper De Burger, in the course of an article upon the mandatory principle as applied to South-West Africa, says : &quot; Generals Botha and Smuts staked everything, even their political reputations, on coming into favour with the Imperialists and Jingos.   The
message adds that Mr. Watt stated that he was prepared experimentally to permit the export of gold for three mouths to enable them to test outside markets, though -certain restrictions would be necessary. He could not allow the banks to export gold because their circumstances were different.Influenza Epidemic : Compulsory Measures. As a safeguard against the influenza epidemic, the Cabinet of New South AVales have decided to make the wearing of masks compulsory.

Mr. Orr urged that the whole question of returned soldiers should be dettit with as a solemn national duty and not in the light of party politics. The -Minister of Defence (Colonel Mentz) stated that the Gom-missioner for Returned Soldiers recommended a Government grant of 5,0001. as a subsidy for vocational training. He announced that 600 returned soldiers had been settled on the land up to December 31st last. * Eventually the motion, with Mr. HammaiFs amendment, was adopted, after the amendment by the Labour Leader (Colonel Creswell) had been rejected and other amendments withdrawn.General Hertzog and Disruption of the Union:-Speaking at a demonstration in honour of the delegation to Europe (which has now arranged to leave by the Durham: Castle on February 15th), General Hertzog is reported to have said : &quot; The South African Party is passing resolutions against a break up of the Union.

The ,
INDIA.(Excluding External Affairs, which are dealt with in the Eastern Report.)Conference of Ruling Princes. According to the published reports there was considerable divergence of opinion manifested at the Conference of Puling Princes and Chiefs concerning the statement in the Moutagu-Chelnisford Report, that it would improve future relations between the Crown and the States if a definite line could be drawn separating the Rulers who enjoy full powers of internal administration and the others.A number of Princes advocated the limitation of membership of the &quot; Council of Princes,&quot; which the Report juoposes to set up, to States possessing full powers of internal administration ; others were in favour of giving some kind of represen-tatiou to the smaller States; and no unanimous recommendation was arrived at. The Conference warmly endorsed the principle of the creation of a &quot;Council of Princes, and proposed that it should be given an Indian name, the title suggested being Narendra Mandal, which was translated as Chamber of Princes. The Conference approved the idea of a Standing Committee of the Princes&apos; Council referred to in the Reforms Report, and of the recommendation for Commissions of Inquiry, where the A&quot;iceroy thinks these desirable, into disputes between States and cases of misconduct. It also endorsed the proposal that, as a general principle, all important States should be placed in direct political relations with the Government of India. The Conference also supported the recommendation that, when questions arise of depriving the Ruler of a State of his rights, dignities, and powers, or of debarring from succession a member of his family, they should always be referred to a Committee appointed by the Viceroy to advise him.The Maharajah of Gwalior, in his speech at the close of the Conference of the Ruling Princes and. Chiefs, referring to the Reform proposals, declared that these measures, which Were irrevocably&apos; promised, would bring in their train enhanced loyalty and contentment in India. The ampler they could be made, with clue regard-to existing conditions, and the quicker they could be enforced, the greater would be their result. &quot; &quot;He continued : &quot;The recent elevation of Sir S. P. Sinha to the peerage and his appointment to office in the British Government furnished an example of true insight, great political imagination, and genuine honesty of purpose.   The recognition of loss which, they suffered in their own party was, indeed, viewed with sad eyes, but they hoped to regain their lost prestige by enlarging Union territory with German South-West. Promises about the allotment of-farms in the conquered territory are proof of this. And what has now happened? According to the principle set forth and driven through by President Wilson, the territory of the Union will, not be enlarged by that of South-West the conquered colony will not become an integral part of the Union, but will be assigned to the Union for government at the mandate of the League of Nations under the supervision of-the League. Generals Botha and Smuts will return to the Union with empty hands. German South-West, whose government costs about 800,000Z. a year, they will still be able to govern, but nothing more. All their fine representations and the assertions of General Smuts about holding what we have all has gone by the board.&quot;South Africans awaiting Passages. In the House of Assembly on February 4th &quot;the Leader of the Opposition (Sir Thomas Smartt) moved the adjournment of the House to discuss the distress among the South Africans in England awaitino- their return to the Union- Sir Thomas Smartt, while expressing gratitude to&apos; the Distress Committee established in London, urged the Government to take over resiDonsibilitv in the matter. The Alinister of the Interior (Sir Thomas Watt) stated that there were 3,900 South Africans at present in London awaiting passage, and that the.Government was doing everything possible to expedite their departure. Mr. Jagger (Unionist) complained that South African mail steamers were conveying troops&quot; to Australia while South Africans were kept-waiting in London. The Acting Prime Minister (Mr. Malan) replied that the Government was pressing for the return of passeno-er vessels.
Tndia&apos;s rights was further emphasised by direct representation at the Peace Conference.&quot; The Maharajah, eulogising the King-Emperor, said the Princes of India rejoiced to find on all sides undeniable evidence of attachment to the British Throne, which was more secure than ever before. &quot; This security, which is broad-based upon the affection and goodwill of the people, is, we firmly believe, going shortly to find its counterpart in the adoption of liberal measures calculated to improve the machinery of governance in India.&quot;The Conference passed a resolution expressing sincerest gratitude to the Viceroy and Mr. Montagu for the- solicitude shown in their report for the welfare of the Ruling Princes and Chiefs, and for safeguarding their interests. They were specially grateful for the confidence that the Viceroy reposed in them where questions of Imperial interests were concerned, thus bringing the Princes and Chiefs into, closer touch with the Imperial Government and \ ncouraging them to take an active interest in the problems of the whole Empire.
