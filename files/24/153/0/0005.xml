K.B. Unless there should he any important and unforeseen developments, the British Empire and Africa Report will not be issued during Christmas week.SECRET.APPRECIATION  OP THE ATTACHED REPORT No. 99.BRITISH EMPIRE AND AFRICA.Imperial Affairs.The forthcoming visit of Lord Jellicoe to the Dominions and India in order to confer with and. advise the Oversea Naval Authorities, should prove of first-rate Imperial importance, and should go far towards determining the methods of co-operation in peace, so that co-operation in war may be made instantly effective.Canada.The statement of Mr. RoAveli, the leading Liberal in Sir R. Borden&apos;s Cabinet, shows a clear appreciation of the importance of sea-power and of the necessity for Dominion participation in world-politics. It should be noted that he emphasises the formation of a League of Nations and a closer union with the United States as essential results of the Peace Conference.In view of statements as to the probable split between the Parties forming the^ Union government, it is useful that a Ministerial statement should have been made as to the complete unanimity with which the present Cabinet is working.The announcement that it is the policy of the Government to keep the Permanent Military Force of the Dominion up to its full strength, on a voluntary basis, is of importance.The facts given in this Report regarding Labour matters show there is little unemployment in the Dominion, though industrial disputes seem to have involved more Joss of time during the last two months than in the corresponding periods of last year.Practical measures are being taken to meet the scarcity of housing accommodation in the larger centres.Australian Commonwealth.Further representative views upon  the importance of  retaining the Pacific Colonies and upon Commonwealth representation at the Peace Conference are given: this week.The visit of a fleet of captured war vessels to Australia would no doubt do much to stimulate interest in naval affairs, and would provide a practical illustration in far distant waters of the supremacy of British sea-powrer.     ; &apos;        ;[p.T.0.
The Cabinet are devoting careful attention to the question of establishing new-industries. The visit of the French Mission, which..has now concluded, will ma questionably promote trading interests between France arid Australia.The population of the Commonwealth is now authoritatively given as over 5,000,000.Though the name of Senator Pearce has been freely mentioned as the possible representative of the Commonwealth Cabinet in London, he is apparently coining to London solely to take charge of Repatriation and Demobilisation arrangements.It is interesting to note that in the democratic community of Australia the extensive powers given to the Government under the War Precautions Act will be continued for three morfths after Peace has been declared.The housing question is as acute in Australia as in other countries.New Zealand.It appears that the New Zealand Ministers cannot arrive in this country until about the middle of January.Amongst the interesting features of Dominion legislation during the Parliamentary Session is the prohibition of former subjects of enemy States (except those who served in the war) from acquiring land without a licence.South Africa.General Botha attended a meeting of the Imperial War Cabinet for the first time on December 18th.The Nationalist resolutions forwarded to His Majesty the King and President Wilson are only important as showing the determination of the Nationalists to press their campaign for independence with vigour. The claim to represent the vast majority of the Dutch population is, of course, a gross exaggeration.The statement by Mr. Burton of the Governments attitude regarding the repatriation of enemy subjects and trading with the enemy should receive attention.India.(Excluding External Affairs.)The Indian Representatives were present at the Imperial War Cabinet meeting on December 18th.The question of Indian desiderata for the Peace settlement is referred to in this Report. The influence of French administration at Chandernagore upon the internal affairs of British India should be specially borne in mind.The Viceroy&apos;s public references concerning the attitude of the Government: towards the Native States, and the measures taken to meet the food scarcity, should be noted.H. d&apos;E.&apos; December 19th, 1918.

BRITISH  EMPIRE  AND  AFRICA  REPORT.IMPERIAL AFFAIRS.Visit of Lord Jellicoe to Dominions and India. As an outcome of a Memorandum outlining a scheme for the naval defence of the British Empire, which was placed before the War Cabinet on May 17th last, the Dominion Ministers (except the Prime Minister of Newfoundland) forwarded a Memorandum to the Admiralty on August loth in which it was stated that it was recognised that the character of construction, methods of training, administration and organisation should proceed upon the same lines in all the Navies of &quot;the Empire, and that the Dominions would welcome visits from a highly qualified representative of the Admiralty who would be thoroughly competent to advise the Dominion Naval Authorities in such matters. The Admiralty, in a Memorandum dated December 17th, 1918, proposed that Viscount Jellicoe should proceed early in the new year to visit such parts of the Empire as expressed a desire to be included in his mission in order to confer with and advise the Dominion Authorities on naval matters. It was also thought desirable to include India.The Imperial War Cabinet at a Meeting on December 18th gave their approval to the proposal of the Admiralty, subject to the consent of the respective Govern-ments. This consent has already been given, except in the case of New Zealand, to which Dominion a cable of enquiry has been sent.SELF-GOVERNING   DOMINIONS.CANADA.Dominion s Peace Conditions. Speaking before the Canadian Club at Westmount the President of the Privy Council (Mr. N. W. Rowell) made a strong declaration last week in favour of Great Britain&apos;s retention of her supremacy at sea. Mr. Powell stated that he looked for three main results at the forthcoming Peace Conference. The first was a just peace ; the second a League of Nations to maintain and enforce that peace ; and the third a strengthening of the unity between the British Common-wealth and the United States. The Minister declared that Canada was vitally interested in the Peace Conference, that henceforth her interests were cast in with the World Powers, and that whether she liked it or not it was impossible for the Dominion to live her own life regardless of what was happening elsewhere.The Union Government. Following the statement in a Toronto newspaper to the effect that the Union Government were likely to break up soon, the Minister of Marine and Naval Service (Mr. C. C. Balkantyne) in an interview characterised the statement as &quot; an invention from beginning to end.&quot; The Minister declared that since the Union Government was first formed there had never been a shadow of dissension amongst the members of the Cabinet, who had worked as one man in dealing with the problems of the war, and, now that the problems of peace were to be faced, the Ministers were working with the same unanimity. Mr. Balkantyne added that the question of a General Election had neither been discussed nor thought of.Permanent Military Force. The Militia Department has decided to recruit the Permanent Military Force of Canada to its full strength of 5,000.
Before the war the force consisted of some 3,000 men, comprising the garrisons at Halifax, Quebec, Kingston, Toronto, Winnipeg, and Esquimalt.The recruiting will be entirely voluntary, and it is not expected that any difficulty will be experienced, as it is considered that a number of returned men will be desirous of continuing in the Army.New System for Returning Soldiers. A new system of returning soldiers to their homes in the Dominion, by which it is hoped to eliminate all delays, has been adopted by the Militia Department, and will be in operation early in the new year.Under the present system, immediately after landing in Canada, a soldier, if he so desires, is given two weeks&apos; furlough, the Department providing -him with money and a railway ticket. It is necessary at the end of the furlough to report to the Headquarters of the Dispersal Area for medical examination before discharge. This method often caused considerable delay.The new system, which will be set in operation as soon- as the necessary machinery is established in England, provides for the issuing of all papers before the men sail for Canada. On arrival in Canada, the men will not be given furlough, but will be sent without delay in batches of 500 to the dispersal areas chosen by the soldiers themselves, and wdll then be given their discharge certificates.Labour Situation. The plans for the establishment of a system of National Labour Bureaux -decided upon at the recent conference between the Provincial Premiers and Federal Ministers are being rapidly w-worked out under the direction of the Minister of Labour (Senator Gideon Robertson). The bureaux will be run by the Provincial authorities, with clearing houses established in Winnipeg and Ottawa under Federal officials. The surve)^ of the labour situation carried out bv the Ministry of .Labour is very encouraging. Only two cities report any unemploy-ment, and state that they are not yet able to absorb all the workers discharged from munition factories.The report of the Department of Lahour for the month of October showed that the labour market was much disturbed by the influenza epidemic. Employment was very good in all shipyards ; in the tanneries employment was better than in the preceding month, and the shoe factories were, in some cases, advertising for help. Employment was very good on the railways and in the repair shops. The loss of time on account of industrial disputes during October wras less than during September, but greater than in October 1917.The November report of the Ministry of Labour shows that the time lost through industrial disputes during the month of November (there being 23 strikes involving 4,300 people) was less than in October of this year, but greater than in November of 1917. The Report states that, of many hundreds of munition w-orkers discharged, the majority were at once absorbed by other industries.Reconstruction Work in France, &amp;c. A Trade Commission, which will take the place of the War Trade Board, has been appointed at Ottawa in order to co-operate with the Canadian Mission in London with a view to securing a share in reconstruction work in France and Belgium, and to developing the export trade of the Dominion.Housing Schemes. It is publicly announced that the Dominion Government have arranged to set aside $250,000,000 to be divided among the Provinces as loans on a population basis for the erection of houses. The Provincial Governments may undertake housing schemes directly or through loans to municipalities, and the Governments of Manitoba and Ontario are the first to take advantage of the Federal authorities&apos; offer. The Federal Loan plan is a direct result of the recent conference between the Provincial Premiers and Dominion Ministers, when it was pointed out that owing to the practical cessation of building operations there was a great scarcity of housing accommodation in the larger centres.Railway and Canal Construction. The directors of the Canadian Government railway system will lay before the Cabinet in a few days their reconstruction pro-gramme for the coming season. If the programme is adopted, it -will call for the expenditure of some f 50,000,000 and will give employment to between 10,000 and 50,000 men in the coming year.It is announced in the Press that it has been decided to complete the Trent Valley Canal connecting Lake Ontario and Georgian Bay ; Work on the Welland Ship Canal is being recommenced.
AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH.The Pacific Islands : Further Resolution. Following upon the debate in the Legislative Council of New South Wales dealing with the German Colonies in the Pacific (vide Report No. 96)&apos;a Resolution, on the lines of Resolutions passed by the Commonwealth and other State Parliaments (vide Reports Nos. 95 and 96) has now been passed by the Legislative Council as follows : &quot; That for the safety of Australia and for the security of the British Empire and the future peace of the world, as well as in the interests of native races, every effort should be made at the Peace Con-ference to ensure that in no circumstances should German possessions in the Pacific be returned to Germany, and that as far as possible, consistently with due regard to any equitable claim of other nations, those possessions should be permanently incorporated within the British Empire.&quot;Peace Conference: Representation of Australia. A conference of local governing bodies in Western xAustralia has passed a resolution that it is essential that Australasian interests should be accorded a prominent place in the peace terms discussion, and that Mr. Hughes, supported by the united voice of Australia, should be invited to take a place at the peace table.Captured Ships for the - Commonwealth. The British Government are to be asked to send to Australia a fleet comprising British and Allied captures of men-of-war and submarines.Establishment of New Industries. In view of the period of reconstruction after the war, the Commonwealth Cabinet have given prolonged consideration to the best means to encourage the establishment of new industries in Australia. Being alive to the fact that the particular conditions surrounding each project will probably require to be dealt with separately, the Cabinet have refrained from laying down hard and fast, rules, which might limit the scope of action. Instead, a broad declaration of policy has been made to the effect that all such proposals will be promptly and sympathetically considered. The Cabinet are anxious to hear from manufacturers and others contemplating the opening up of new industries in the Commonwealth,, and now invite definite proposals containing full particulars.French Mission: Trade with France. The French Mission, before leaving Australia for France on December 13th, were entertained by the Commonwealth Government at the Federal Parliament House. The Acting Prime Minister (Mr. Watt) said he hoped there would spring out of this visit, in addition to the closer union of kinship, the important tie of commerce. He continued: &quot;None of us want to see Germans or Austrians take any place in the future trade of this country. We do want to see the places they have occupied in our economic and industrial life taken by higher types of humanity, and of friendlier nations. I believe this visit will result in substantial commercial reciprocity of mutual advantage between France and Australia. It will induce a more intelligent recognition of identity of interest of the two countries in southern waters, that will make for the peace and stability of the Pacific in days to come.&quot; Mr. Tudor, Leader of the Opposition in the Federal Parliament, supported the toast, and said he was glad that two additional members of the Mission were arriving to study industrial conditions in Australia.The Mission will recommend the French Government to establish a trade bureau at Sydney.Population of the Commonioealth. The Commonwealth Statistician announces, that the population of Australia is now over 5,000,000.Extension of War Precautions Act. The Acting Prime Minister (Mr. Watt), in the course of an official statement in Parliament of the intentions of the Federal Government regarding future operations under the War -Precautions Act, said he-agreed with the view that it was not a sound principle in normal or safe times to allow the executive to usurp the functions of the legislature. All were desirous of returning to the constitutional form of government. But some powers and responsi-bilities which had grown up under the War Precautions Act could not be suddenly terminated without tremendous danger. He instanced phases of the moratorium provisions, also the control of shipping, sugar, cornsacks, wool, wheat, butter, cheese and other commodities.Regarding the censorship he said that action must still be enforced to prevent ill-considered publications likely to injure the relations between Great Britain and the
Allies during peace negotiations, and utterances calculated to injure Australia^ fiuancial credit. Other powers, such, as the control of aliens and internees, must still be maintained. These wcruld have to continue until the peace terms were settled. The Ministry was not in a position yet-to schedule the precise functions which must be continued, nor to fix a time limit, but it had no intention whatever to use the Act or regulations for political purposes. There would be a gradual removal of censorship conditions except in the two directions named above, also a steady removal of interference with commerce.The Second Reading of the Bill to extend the War Precautions Act for six months after the war was carried in the House of Representatives by 34 votes to 26. Five Ministerialists voted with the Labour Opposition. The Federal Ministry, however, in Committee amended the Act in order to fix its duration until July 31st nest, or three (instead of six) months after the cessation of the war.Treatment of Returning Soldiers. On the formal motion for the adjournment of the House of Representatives members made strong complaints of the treatment of returning men on troopships, particularly regarding food and accommodation. The Acting-Prime Minister (Mr. Watt) replying, said judgment should be suspended on some of the allegations until investigation had been made. Both sides should be heard before credence was given to extravagant or alarmist statements. The Government had cabled to Mr. Hughes as follows:-&quot;Re ship arrangements for return of Australian troops, in my judgment it is of utmost importance to see, in connection with embarkation from Great Britain, that seaworthy ships should be selected, that over-crowding should be prevented, that medical comforts should be sufficient, in addition to the food arrangements being on a generous scale. The Barambah incident indicates strong public feeling here against carelessness or niggardliness on board ship.&quot; Mr. Watt added that when the time came for the Commonwealth authority to take over transport arrangements the Commonwealth Ministry would become entirely-responsible and answerable.   At present they were not.Demobilisation Arrangements. The Minister for Repatriation (Senator Milieu), referring to statements by Captain Carmichael, M.L.A., alleging a lack of co-operation between London and Australia regarding demobilisation arrangements, said that Captain Carmichael knew nothing of the actual position. The Minister for Defence (Senator Pearce) refused to make any comment,- remarking that Mr. Hughes was looking after matters in England as the direct representative of the Federal Govern-ment, while a mixed committee of military officials and civilians was in charge of the demobilisation scheme.The Minister for Repatriation states that by December 31st of next year 19,000 holdings will be required for returned soldiers.Ministerial Representative coming to England. -Reports indicate that the Minister for Defence (Senator Pearce) will shortly leave Australia for England in order to take over the administration of demobilisation and repatriation arrangements for the Coinnionvveall.li. .Peace Celebrations. The Federal Cabinet have generally approved the proposals of the Peace Celebrations Committee for a three days&apos; programme on the official declaration of Peace. On the first day, thanksgiving services in all churches and chapels throughout Australia, uniform as far as possible, and speciah undenominational services in the parks and gardens with naval and military bands, and philharmonic and chora4 societies, will take place. Second day : Salutes, naval and military marches, processions, pageants, exhibitions of war trophies, decorated buildings, triumphal arches, bands and street choirs, led by philharmonic and choral and theatrical societies ; in the evening, illuminations, carnival processions in masquerade and charade costumes. Third day : childron&apos;s exhibitions in sports grounds and parks, tableaux, aquatic reviews, regattas, aeronautical displays ; in the evening, illumi-/nations, street carnivals, and fireworks displaj^s. A souvenir medal is to be issued to Wery child.Deputy Leader of Opposition. It is announced that Mr. W. G. Higgs, M.P., has been elected Deputy Leader of the Federal Parliamentary Labour Party.   Mr. Higgs7001-3aE
formerly held the office of Commonwealth Treasurer, before the split in the Labour Party occurred upon the conscription issue.Wool for Allies.-The British Government have telegraphed to the Common-wealth Government their regret that proposals made might have proved unsatisfactory to Australian wool growers, but have intimated that before the telegram was received from the Commonwealth Government [vide Report No. 98), the British authorities had decided, in consideration of altered circumstances, to modify the proposals. It is pointed out that&apos; it was never intended that the arrangement with the United States as to rebates on military wool should apply to the 240,000 bales shipped this year for unrestricted use.The  Commonwealth Government have also been informed that the British Government have telegraphed to the South African Government that the altered circumstances make it undesirable to offer the increased percentage in commutation : of the share   of expected   profits, and that the  Onion  Government  have   been authorised to repeat the offer of October 1917.(Vide also under &quot;New Zealand &quot; and &quot; South Africa &quot; and Report No. 98.)Housing Scheme. The Minister for Repatriation (Senator Millen), in moving the Second Reading of a War Service Homes Bill in the Commonwealth Senate, said that the housing problem was as acute in Australia as in other countries. The Bill, he said, would enable discharged members of the Australian Imperial Force, nurses, and members of medical services, who were married or about to marry, or the widow or widowed mother and other dependants, to apply for homes. The maximum loan to an individual was 7,000L Illustrating the working of the scheme, the Minister said that on a G001. house there would be a payment of 18s. 6d. weekly on 37 years terms, and of 15s. 4cZ. a week on 26 years terms. Possibly the Bill would involve an ex-penditure of 50,000,000Z.   The Second Reading was agreed to.NEW ZEALAND.The Prime Minister and Sir Joseph Ward.- The Prime Minister (Mr. Massey) and the Minister of Finance (Sir Joseph Ward) left for Colon on December 12th and they will be met at Colon on December 31st by H.M.S. Ophir, in which the two Mhiisters and their Secretaries will he conveyed to the United Kingdom. The other members of the party (Mrs. and Miss Massey, Lady Ward and Mr. Ward) will &quot;proceed from Colon to the United Kingdom by the Remuera.Work of Parliamentary Session. The legislation of the Parliamentary Session is stated in the Press to include the prohibition of former subjects of enemy States or their wives from acquiring land without a licence. Persons of this description who served in the war are exempt, but sons of former enemy subjects become liable if they refused or neglected service.The Repatriation Act provides for a Board with wide powers to establish a scheme of institutions for the educational, industrial, and vocational . training of discharged soldiers and for the care and maintenance of the disabled.The   Government  have   also   decided   (according   to   Press   announcements) retrospectively to increase separation allowances, officers&apos; pay, outfit allowance, and &apos; to make other liberal educational provisions for soldiers, totalling 2,000,000^.South African Wool Clip.- The Dominion Government have been informed that in view of the objections they had expressed, and of the altering conditions of the market, the British Government decided not to make the offer to purchase the South African wool clip on the lines suggested. The Dominion Government have been further informed as to the terms upon which the Union Government were authorised to invite the South African farmers to register their wool for sale (vide also under &quot;South Africa,&quot; and Report No. 98). It is pointed out that the arrangement is identical -with the British offer made to South Africa in October 1917.
SOUTH AFRICA.Arrival of Prime Minister. The Prime Minister (General Botha) arrived in London on December-16th, accompanied by Mrs. Botha, Sir David and Lady Graaff, &quot;Sir William and Lady Hoy, and other officials. General Botha attended a meeting of the Imperial War Cabinet for the first time on December 18th, and a cordial welcome washes tended to him by the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.Nationalists and Independence. The Leader of the Nationalists (General Hertzog) has forwarded to the Governor-General the text of Resolutions, addressed to His Majesty the King and President Wilson, which have been passed by the Central Committees of the Nationalist Parties of the Cape, Natal, Transvaal, and Orange Free State Provinces. The Resolution addressed to His Majesty, after giving expression to an expectation of a lasting peace based on the principles of right and justice, proceeds to give utterance to the feeling of gratitude at the recognition of the inalienable right of every civilised people to be free, and at the acceptance of the principle of the restitution of injured rights and liberties as cardinal principles to be applied both at the Peace Conference and in the future conduct of international relations. The Resolution then conveys to His Majesty the earnest appeal of the members of the Nationalist Parties for the application of these principles to the provinces of the Union and the confident expectation that the appeal will be granted. The Resolution goes on to express the conviction of the necessity of making clear the true state of affairs obtaining in the Union with regard to the claim for independence. The Committees therefore state that as there is a large and important section of the population, including the vast majority of the Dutch, whose desires would not otherwise be represented, a Congress will be held in Bloemfontein at the earliest possible date for the purpose of appointing a deputation to proceed to Europe, who will be instructed to convey the true state of feeling in the Qnion, and to urge the direct application of the above enunciated principles to the Cape, Natal, Transvaal, and Orange Free State Provinces.In the Resolution forwarded to President Wilson by. General Hertzog, the feeling of gratitude at the recognition of the right of every civilised people to be free, and the acceptance of the principle as to the restitution of injured rights and liberties, are referred to in similar terms to those quoted above, and the Resolution proceeds to convey to the President the sincere and deep-felt thanks of the Committees for his strenuous and noble efforts in enforcing the adoption of these high and humane principles, and their wish to convey to him the assurance that they rely on the full application of these principles to the Cape, Natal, Transvaal and the Orange Free State.An announcement has been published by the Nationalist leaders that the Congress will be held at Bloemfontein on January 16th for the purpose of appointing a deputation to proceed to Europe to secure the independence of the Cape, Transvaal, Natal, and Orange Free State Provinces. Subscriptions are asked for towards the necessary fund of 10.00QLThe Wool Clip. In reply to the telegram from the Union Government on the subject of the wool clip (vide Report No. 98), the British Government have agreed to extend the period for registration of acceptance of the offer to December 31st. As to the limit of quantity it is observed that the registration of only a small portion of the clip would show that the majority of farmers were not interested in the offer, which is made principally to satisfy the Union that the British Government are anxious to place South Africa in a position as favourable as that occupied by the other Dominions in relation to wool purchase. It is pointed out that the offers to Australia and New Zealand were for the total wool clip. However, the willingness of the British Government to reduce the limit of quantity to 150,000 bales is expressed. If this should not be acceptable, the British authorities would prefer to withdraw from the matter, which, it is observed, is now superfluous from a military standpoint.Repatriation of Enemy Subjects and German Colonies. Large meetings have been held at Johannesburg, Durban, Pietermaritzburg and various centres throughout Natal, at which resolutions have been passed strongly advocating the repatriation of . interned enemy subjects, particularly German, punishment for the ill-treatment of Allied prisoners of war and the retention of the former German Colonies.7001-3n c
Government Attitude on Repatriation of Enemy Subjects and Trading with. Enemy. The Union Minister of Railways and Harbours (Mr. Henry Burton), in the course of an address to his constituents at Ladysmith on December 8th, dealt with the resolutions recently passed in various parts of South Africa in favour of the repatriation of enemy subjects. Mr. Burton announced that the South African Government had decided, unless the peace terms precluded such action, to repatriate, firstly, all enemy subjects who expressed a desire for repatriation, and seconmy,**all enemy subjects and British subjects of enemy origin whose conduct had caused them to be regarded as dangerous to the State. All naturalised subjects, he added, who expressed a desire for denaturalisation would be denaturalised prior to their repatriation. While sympathising with the natural indignation and resentment at the enemy s conduct, the Minister emphasised that the Union Government could not be euided by sentiment alone, but must act in the best interests of the country. &quot;Victory, he declared, should be borne with dignity and national self-restraint and without committing any injustice or unfairness to any section of the population.; It was impossible for the Government to comply with the demand for wholesale repatriation of enemy subjects, as such action would undoubtedly be unjust and unreasonable and contrary to the spirit of the Constitution as well as the best interests of the country. Continuing, Mr. Burton recalled the fact that enemy subjects in South Africa were largely voluntary immigrants who had established themselves in British settlements and that they had generally proved themselves to be law-abiding and peaceful citizens, many of whom, he pointed out, had fought on the British side during the war. He also referred to the probability, and he thought he might almost sa)7 the certainty, that before long they would have to incorporate in the Union the new territory the inhabitants of which were mainly German. It would therefore be both wrong and most unwise, by adopting a policy savouring of revenge and hatred, to create a spirit complicating still further the already sufficiently difficult problems awaiting solution in South Africa. He had not yet had. the advantage, he also remarked, of hearing the line of policy which would be taken by the Allies, and especially by Great Britain, on this subject at the forthcoming joeace negotiations.Referring then to the resolutions opposing future trading with the enemy, Mr. Burton urged careful investigation, as in his opinion the only sound course was to take the necessary precautions to secure the future of South African trade, and develop the country&apos;s resources in conjunction and in co-operation with the other parts of the British Empire. Further than this it would, he considered, be both impolitic and foolish to attempt any specific State control of matters foreign to its regulation.Mr. Merrnnan and the League of Nations. Mr. J. X. Merriinan in a recent speech, dealt with the League of Nations in the following words : &quot; 1 do not suppose that newspapers would be writing, or politicians holding forth, on the need for a League of Nations if they had studied history. Let them go back to the Holy Alliance. That Alliance lasted just six months. Then its members formed a league against each other.&quot;Ex-Soldiers and Sailors and Tuberculosis Regulations.  With reference to the report from London that the Union Government had decided to waive the tuberculosis immigration regulations in so far as they affected ex-sailors and ex-soldiers, ReuteFs Agency has been authorised to state that the estimate by a London newspaper that 100,000 ex-soldiers and ex-sailors suffering from tuberculosis would probably benefit thereby, is not understood in South Africa. The Union Government have been obliged to refuse to support the scheme for the establishment in the Vryburg district of a sanatorium which would accommodate several hundreds of ex-soldiers and ex-sailors from England suffering from tuberculosis. The information in the possession of the Union Government is that the Australian Commonwealth has, for tne protection of its population, felt obliged to decline to receive ex-soldiers and ex-sailors suffering from tuberculosis. To prevent any misunderstanding in the United Kingdom, the Union Government have cabled to the High Commissioner for South Africa, that in granting permits to ex-soldiers and ex-sailors to come to South Africa regard must be had to the exclusion of persons suffering- from tuberculosis and other infectious diseases.
INDIA.(Excluding External Affairs, which are dealt with in the Eastern Report.)Imperial War Cabinet. Tile Maharaja of Bikaner and Sir S. P. Sinha attended the meeting of the Imperial War Cabinet on December 18th.   The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom welcomed them on their &quot;reappearance and referred to the source of strength which India had been to the Empire throughout the war, and notably during the present year.The Government of India and Native States. At the investiture of the Maharaja of Bharatpur the Viceroy referred to the attitude of the Government towards the Native States. He said the British minority in these administrations was sometimes criticised for aiming too much at the standard of British India and for anxiety towards reform, by which it was alleged that the old spirit of the State administration tended to become lost and the ties between Prince and subject liable to be loosened. He was happy to believe that nothing of the kind had happened at Bharatpur The reorganisation of the. more important administrations had made the administrative machine more suited to modern methods of government, but in the others old-world forms remained, and change had been limited to a reduction of. expenditure and closer control.Food Scarcity. -A Bombay Government Note to the Press shows that the existence of. scarcity has been declared in seven districts and in the Kathiawar Agency. While the general condition of the people does not immediately cause anxiety, it is apprehended that, in spite of the measures taken to repair the fodder deficiency, heav3? cattle mortality is inevitable. Efforts must be concentrated on the preservation of the more valuable plough and milch cattle, on which the agricultural prosperity of the country depends.Since the agricultural population throughout the Presidency have benefited by the series of good years, they are probably better able to resist famine than ever before, particularly in the cotton districts, and where market produce, such as sugar-cane, is grown, high prices clue to war conditions have enriched agriculturists to an unprecedented extent. The demand for labour has much exceeded the supply, and high wages have been obtained for even the most unskilled labour.The Director of Civil Supplies has arranged for the conve3rance of 97,000 tons of Burma rice to Bombay, and other measures are being taken for the sale of grain at controlled prices. The Government, are providing 50 lakhs of rupees (333,333L 6s. Sd.) for takavi (advances to farmers) during the current financial year, and are estimating for a further -60 lakhs next year.Desiderata for Peace Settlement. In a Note by the Political Department of the India Office (P. 42), dated December 4th, 1918, the question of Indian desiderata for the Peace Settlement is considered under two heads the disposal of conquered territories, and arrangements &quot;with Allied Powers.Under the first-named heading Indian interests in Mesopotamia, German East Africa, &amp;c, are considered. It is pointed out that German East Africa is of interest to India because, in the hands of a Power hostile, or potentially hostile, to Great Britain, it might afford a base for enemy naval activity in the Indian Ocean, and because of the advantages offered by the Colony for Indian immigration.In discussing arrangements with Allied Powers, the Note states that French territorial rights in India fall under two heads, viz. : (1) Settlements held in full sovereignty and administered by French resident officials, and (2) certain scattered patches of land known as Doges, the sites of former French factories, over which the French Government claim to exercise certain rights of jurisdiction. So far as the four Maclras Settlements (Pondicherry, Karikak Ma he and Yanaon) are concerned, the Avorst that can be said is that their continued existence constitutes an administrative inconvenience. But, it is observed, the question of really vital importance is Chandernagore, where the situation may fairly be described as intolerable on account of the town becoming, through the weakness of local French administration, a veritable hotbed of revolutionary conspiracy, directed against the British Government. It provides an anarchist centre within a few miles of Calcutta, where plans can be hatched, bombs manufactured, arms imported, &amp;c, with absolute impunity.    In
summing np the Note submits that it would be desirable to press for the complete extinction of French territorial rights of every description throughout India and failing that for the cession of Chandernagore and the abolition of the JLoges: As to Portuguese possessions in the Bombay Presidency, it is mentioned that the elimination of Portuguese territorial rights would be an administrative convenience but that it can hardly be put higher. Other important matters touching the interests of Afghanistan and Tibet, Persia and Arabia are dealt with in the Note. As regards arms traffic, it is observed that the recommendations- of the Sub-Committee of the War Cabinet which reported in March 1917 have the cordial support of the Government of India.
