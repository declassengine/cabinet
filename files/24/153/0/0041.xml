BRITISH   EMPIRE   AND   AFRICA  REPORT.SELF-GOVERNING   DOMINIONS...........CANADA.   &apos;Parliament and Peace Treaty. The Governor-General opened Parliament on September 1st. The Speech from the Throne referred to the visit of the Prince of Wales as renewing his happy associations with his comrades of the Canadian Army, and at the same time undertaking the important duty of making himself acquainted at first-hand with the resources and development of the country and with the ideals and aspirations of the people. - -The Speech pointed out that Parliament had been summoned to consider and approve the Peace Treaty, and added that it was felt that the Treaty ought not to be ratified on behalf of Canada, without the approval of Parliament. Referring to the difficult reconstruction period, the Speech said -that the labours of reconstruction might be difficult and even painful, but Canada must undertake them with the same united resolve and inflexible purpose as had sustained its efforts during the years of conflict.The Prime Minister (Sir Robert Borden) moved the Resolution in the House of Commons - asking Parliament to approve the Peace Treaty on September 2nd. He explained the Treaty and the attitude adopted by the Canadian Delegates at the Peace Conference. He referred to the constitutional development by which the Dominion representatives were given the full powers of plenipotentiary Delegates, including the power to sign the Treaty. The constitutional structure of the Empire, Sir Robert Borden continued, was imperfectly understood by other nations, even by a nation so close in kinship as the United States. On behalf of his country he stood firmly upon this solid ground, that in this greatest of all wars, in which the future of the world was at stake, Canada led the democracies of both American continents, and the same indomitable spirit that made her capable of that effort and sacrifice made her equally incapable of accepting the League of Nations or the Peace Conference with a status inferior to that accorded to nations of less advanced development and less amply endowed with wealth, with no more complete sovereignty, and with far less conscious sacrifice.It is anticipated that the Parliamentary Session will last about two months.The Grown and the People : Prime Minister and Constitutional Position. At the official luncheon at Ottawa given to the Prince of Wales, the Prime Minister (Sir Robert Borden) made some important references to the constitutional position of the Dominions. He said : &quot; With the growth and development of self-government in the great Dominions it has Come to pass that the tie of a common alliance is the chief bond which knits the nations of Britannia into a Commonwealth. For each of these nations there is but one Crown, acting in each Dominion and Province or State upon the advice of Ministers responsible to the people and invested by their mandate. Thus throughout the Empire there has been created a direct and perfect relation between the Crown and the people. The King, acting through his Ministers, is the executive head of the Government in each Dominion, fulfilling the will of the people in the selection of his advisers. He stands above party or faction, the acknowledged head of the State.&quot;Sir Robert went on to say that as the war proceeded it became necessary to have a more perfect co-operation between the component parts Of the Empire, and it was attained.   He continued : &quot; The guiding principle was laid down that, within our Commonwealth of . nations, the equality of nationhood must be recognised, preserving thus to each Dominion the full autonomous powers which it now holds and safeguarding ^to each by necessary consultation and in an adequate voice and influence its highest interests in the issues of the war or peace, for each nation the complete control of its own affairs, and for the whole Empire the necessary co-operation according to the will of the people in all matters of common concern.&quot;
General Gurrie and New Militia System.  General Currie, speaking at Toronto last week, declared that it was the greatest lolly for any country to be unprepared, and he believed that a miiitia system could be introduced into Canada which would give the people the worth of their money, and,.,if necessity should arise, would be able to do its duty promptly and effectively.Mineral Output. The total value of the output of the mines of Canada in 1917 reached the sum of $189,646,534, as shown in the annual report of the Department of Mines on the Mineral Production of Canada, recently issued. Compared with the total value of the production in 1916 which was $ 1.77,201,531, that of 1917 shows an increase of 7&apos;02 per cent., and in pbiut of value represents the largest output on record, as stated in the report.Trade with Australia. A report from Melbourne of the acting Trade Coinmis-sioner slates that despite the general decrease in imports from other countries, during 1917-18, trade with Australia in goods of Canadian origin was not only well maintained but increased by 258,977i. or $1,258,628, and attaiued a higher level than in any preceding year. - - .  - .The direct Australian exports to Canada are chiefly shipped by the Canadian-Australasian mail steamers under contract with the Canadian Government which load at Sydney for Victoria and Vancouver. Intermittent cargo steamers are also engaged in the Pacific coast trade. There are no direct shipments from Australia to eastern Canadian ports.AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH.Parliament and Peace Treaty. The Federal Parliament has adjourned until September 10th. One of the earliest questions to be considered after the recess will be matters concerning the Peace Treaty.Prime Minister and, Australian Gain by tjie War. The Prime Minister (Mr. Hughes), responding to a welcome on his return to Australia, said the country had got everything she fought for, and the people&apos;s salvation was not to be found in setting class against class, but in raising the whole structure of society by widely opening up the gateway of opportunity.Labour Criticism of Russian Policy. In the Federal House.of Representatives on September 1st the Labour member, Mr, Considine, was suspended for one month for refusing to withdraw his statement that the Government was supporting the greatest murderer in the world, Admiral Koltchak.Profiteering Legislation.. Summary profiteering legislation has recently passed through the Commonwealth Parliament.Peace Loan. The Peace Loan of twenty-five millions for demobilisation and repatriation opened on August 26th.Seamen s Strike : Removal of Coal Restrictions. With reference to the announcement in the last Report (vide Report No. 134) that the seamen&apos;s strike was at an end, it now appears from public statements in the Press, &amp;c, that a mass meeting of seamen on August 26th agreed to return to work immediately on the terms proposed by the Government at a round-table conference. Questions - not settled there were to be waived; and it was stipulated that there should be no reference to the Arbitration Court.The coal restrictions resulting from the shipping strike are being removed, and the round-table conference met on September 1st to consider claims for better accommodation, a six hours&apos; day in the port, insurance against sickness and death, an increase in wages and other matters.Commonwealth Ships. It is officially stated that the Commonwealth owns 76 ships, either in commission,&apos; under construction, or authorised. Eight wooden ships built in America have been commissioned, and six are still under construction.Wool Control. The Central Wool Committee will cease on June 13th next year, but it is stated that further control will be essential in the interests of all concerned unless some practical effort is made to speed up shipments.Queensland Railways. The Queensland Minister for Railways (Mr. Fihelly) states-that Queensland is building 114 miles of railway in the southern, 46 in the central, and 243 in the northern divisions, employing 3,114 men.SSS^la A 2
..... . NEW ZEALAND.Opening of Parliament: Status of Dominions, Legislative Programme. -The Governor-General, in opening the New Zealand Parliament, said that the status accorded to the Dominion by tbe Allied Nations marked tbe beginning of a new era in the national history.He outlined the legislative programme, which included the approval of the Peace Treaty, the acceptance of the Samoan mandate, the extension of various war emergency measures, including the mortgage moratorium. Referring to the coal shortage, he expressed anxiety at conditions which were making the Dominion dependent for supplies from elsewhere. Freezing chambers were full of meat, for which the Imperial Government had paid millions. Therefore every obligation of honour and duty required a supply of coal for the continuous working of the freezing machinery; The grants fur repatriation and the settlement of soldiers upon the land were wholly insufficient. Ministers who had far exceeded their authority had to ask for confirmation of their acts, and also for very large additional sums.Approval of Peace Treaty. The Resolution assenting to the ratification of the Peace Treaty has been carried by acclamation in both Houses of the Dominion Parliament. The Prime Minister (Mr. Massey) in introducing the Resolution, dealt specially with Samoa and Nauru, and in his peroration he referred to the Navy as the bulwark of the Empire and to New Zealancks obligations to increase her naval effort.Sir Joseph Ward said that the League of Nations was the greatest, work of the Peace Conference, but the League; must not interfere with the British Navy. He considered that Great Britain was a better mandatory for Samoa than New Zealand, especially owing to the coloured labour problem.New Ministry. The New Zealand Cabinet has been partly reconstructed. It is publicly announced that Mr. Massey, the Prime Minister, takes the Ministry of Railways, Sir J. Allen that of Finance, and Mr. Berries that of Native Affairs. To two new Ministers, Major Line and Mr. Nosworthy, portfolios are as yet unallotted.Position of Sir Joseph Ward. Addressing a Liberal meeting. Sir Joseph Ward said that he left the National Government because he was not asked to stay. He had no quarrel with Mr. Massey, the Prime Minister, but there were important matters on which he was not consulted and on which he was entitled to be consulted. This was, in his opinion, a sufficient reason for withdrawal from the Government.The Post says that. Sir Joseph Wards statement indicates strained relations and mutual mistrust, which were probably a greater obstacle to prolonging the partnership than any differences as to policy.Victory Loan. It is announced that the Dominion Government is issuing a 10,000,060L. Victory Loan immediately.Lord Jellicoe and Naval Policy for the Dominion. -It is reported from Wellington that Lord Jellicoe in replying to a deputation from the Navy League said he considered any great, reduction of Great Britaiiks naval expenditure impossible, and it was likely ,to remain at about 11. per head. New Zealand, if she desired to do her share in maintaining the Navy, should also contribute 11. per head, either in cash or in the form of a New Zealand unit maintained and trained in complete uniformity with the Imperial Fleet and in no way tied to the shores of New Zealand.SOUTH AFRICA.General Smuts as Prime Minister: Cabinet Reconstruction. -The British Government have been informed that General Smuts has accepted the invitation of the Governor-General to form an Administration.All the colleagues of General Smuts and the late Cabinet of General Botha have agreed to continue in their offices. General Smuts retains for the present the portfolio of Minister of Defence and will, in addition,, take that of Native Affairs. The Ministers are to be sworn in on September 3rd.Union Press on the late Genercd Eotha. ReuteFs correspondent in Cape Town telegraphed-on August 28th that the newspapers throughout the Union showed such remarkable unanimity in praising the late General Botha&apos;s honour, chivalry and
faith, that they might almost have been written by one hand. They all dwelt on their deep sense of personal sorrow at his death. These opinions are reiterated in the Transvaal, Cape,&apos;Natal and Free State papers, Dutch and British alike, and the two most frequent words used are &quot; irreparable loss.&quot; The Voltistem asks : &quot; 1 low will his loss react on the people? &quot; Will&apos; quarrels be intensified in the absence of-:his moderating influence ? &quot;Hallway Material and Aeroplanes : Parliamentary Resolution. AVith regard to the gifts of railway material and aeroplanes to the Union of South Africa, the following Resolution of the South African House of Assembly has been officially communicated to the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom by letter from the Clerk of the Union House, dated 19th June 1919, viz. : &quot; That the cordial thanks of this House be conveyed to His Majesty&apos;s Government for the munificent gift of railway material and aeroplanes which it has proposed to bestow on the Union of South Africa-gifts which are the more welcome because the Union is in urgent need of such material and aeroplanes, and has experienced great difficulty in obtaining the same -further that this House records its deep appreciation of the generous spirit which prompted His Majesty&apos;s Government in making these gifts.&quot; ,Chambers of Commerce and Enemy Subjects.-At the meeting of the Congress of South African Chambers of Commerce on August 27th, the Durban-;&apos; and Johannesburg Chambers moved drastic resolutions in favour of. restricting the,entry of subjects of tbe late enemy Powers and trade with Germany. Mr. Baxter,.: member of the Union Legislative Assembly and President of the Cape Town Chamber ;of Commerce, quoted M. Clemenceau&apos;s letter informing the Germans that the,Allies did not intend to starve Germany or prevent her taking her proper place in the world&apos;s commerce, provided Germany adhered to the Peace Treaty. Mr. Baxter contended that this undertaking was as equally binding as the Treaty. The matter was then dropped. &apos; :j;   &apos;&quot;&apos; &apos;INDIA.Economic and Famine Conditions. The Viceroy reported to the India: Office by telegram dated August 29th that, except for some damage by incessant, rain and floods in Bundelkhand, Central Provinces, Gujarat, Sind aaicl Rajputana, the condition and prospects of the standing crops continued satisfactory.
