APPRECIATION Oh THE ATTACHED REPORT No. 121.BRITISH  EMPIRE  AND AFRICA.Canada.Mr. Crerar has developed his reasons for resignation. These do not seem to have appeared convincing to many representative western grain growers. The tariff question, however, is likely to develop into a great issue, and the defections of Western Liberal Unionists will probably strengthen the growing party of in-depehdents who now occupy seats on the Cross Benches.The Liberals will construct their party programme at the August Convention. Mr. Martin has given some indication of the attempt that will be made to obtain the support of the farmers on the tariff question.The labour troubles in the West continue to be serious.Australian Commonwealth.The apprehension of Commonwealth Ministers as to the rumoured return of prominent Germans to New Guinea may be well understood.The shipping strike is exercising a very detrimental influence upon industry.New Zealand.The Ministerial statement as to political and social unrest no doubt indicates an early appeal to the electorate,South Africa.Notwithstanding pressure the Governor-General will not withhold his assent to the Bill dealing &quot;with Indian trading and land ownership.The matter of cable delays which has been raised in Parliament closely affects all South Africans who are anxious to follow the course of important events in Europe.German Colonies.The line now taken in Germany is to show the importance of Colonial territories, both as a support for home industry and as an outlet for the German people who are unable to find a living in Germany, in order to enable an indemnity to be paid.H. d&apos;E.June 19th, 1919-

BRITISH  EMPIRE   AND   AFRICA  REPORT.SELF-GOVERNING   DOMINIONS.CANADA.Budget Debate.-Jn the course of the Budget debate the retiring Minister of -Agriculture (Mr. T. A. Crerar) stated that he originally joined the Government from a sense of duty regarding the policies Avhich were necessary for running the war. But the war was now over, and when he came to consider the fiscal policy of Canada he found himself in sharp opposition to the Government policy, and he felt that the only honourable course to follow was to resign. The former Minister emphasised the fact that in his opinion the new Budget was Protectionist. If the Tariff was reduced, the question arose as to how it should be made up. Three methods were suggested in the platform of the Canadian Council of Agriculture. The first was income tax, the second a graduated inheritance,tax, and the third a direct tax on unimproved land values. Mr. Crerar thought it necessary that the Dominion fiscal policy should be modified in view of the tremendous events the country had gone through.The Minister of Immigration and Colonisation (Mr: J. A. Calder) disagreed with those who said the Government should bring down proposals for an immediate Tariff revision, and he stated that the present Government was formed on the war policy, and not on a Tariff question. None of the present members was elected because of his Tariff views. &quot; The question must be decided,&quot; declared the Minister, &quot;whether the Government as at present constituted shall be allowed to carry on. It hurst be decided whether the time has arrived for the present administration to retire and make way for another.&quot;Dr. Michael Clark, the Well-known exponent of Free Trade, continued the Budget debate, and&apos;announced that, had the rules of the House so permitted, he would have proposed a sub-amendment to that of Mr. Macmaster calling for the removal of the duties, not only on foodstuffs and implements used in their production, but on iron, steel, boots, shoes, cotton and woollen clothing and raw material entering into their production, and on coal. He said he steered a middle course between the positions , of Messrs. T. A. Crerar and J. A. Calder, and he thought that Westerners would be gratified, but by no means satisfied, with the tariff reductions granted.Mr. F. B. Stacey (U., New Westminster) combated Mr. CreraFs statement that the country was at peace. Regarding the Labour situation, he said : &quot; The situation in the West is not merely a labour strike, but is &apos;a direct blow at all government. It was therefore a serious thing for any Minister of the Crown even to appear to strike a blow or to embarrass the Government of Canada.&quot;The President of the Privy Council (Mr. N. W. Rowell) said that the present high cost of living was as inevitable as had been the casualties on the battlefield. The labour troubles were not due to this cause. Labour demanded a new deal, and the only basis of settlement possible was that of co-operation. Bolshevism must be stamped out, and Anglo-Saxon methods reintroduced. The country was now suffering from four causes, all directly due to the war a heavy public debt, high cost of living, industrial unrest and national nervousness. Mr. Rowell prophesied that the country&apos;s natural resources, combined with unity and courage, would make it possible for the debt to be met.Party Arrangements. The ex-Minister of Agriculture (Mr. Crerar) is now occupying a seat on the Cross Benches in the House of Commons. These benches are becoming occupied by members who have strong followings in the country but who are taking up an independent attitude. Amongst these members are Mr. W. S. Fielding, Mr. Pardee, Mr. W. F. Nickle, Major W. Andrews and Dr. Michael Clark.It is anticipated in Parliamentary circles that immediately on the close of the session, the Prime Minister (Sir Robert Borden) will deal with the question of reconstructing the Ministry. It is considered likely that before the close of the session a full caucus of the Ministerial Party will be held in order to consider the means of making the Union Party a permanent one.
oAt the Liberal Convention to be held in Ottawa in August a Liberal Party platform will be constructed. The question of the Party Leadership will also be most important. The Party seems uncertain as to whom they should choose, though it is considered likely that some Westerner will be appointed to step into Sir Wilfrid LauriePs place. Among the men who are mentioned as likely to succeed to the Liberal Leadership are Mr. D. 1). Mackenzie, the acting Opposition Leader; Mr. W. M. Martin, Premier of Saskatchewan; Mr. Mackenzie King, Minister of Labour in the last Laurier Government ; Mr. A. B. Hudson, former Attorney-General of Manitoba; and Sir Lomer Gouin, Premier of Quebec.Mr. W. M. Martin. Premier of Saskatchewan, has issued an appeal to the people to unite for free food, free fuel, and material tariff reductions. He declares that Canada is the most highly taxed country in the world, and that in the framing of the tariff the farmers have been the last to receive consideration.Attitude of Grain Growers&apos; Convention. It is announced in the Press that the Grain Growers&apos; Convention at Moose Jaw has approved the position taken up by the Minister of Immigration (Mr. Calder) as against that of Mr. Crerar, after a warm-debate.     The    Liberals   in   Alberta   constituencies   are,    however,    expressing -dissatisfaction with the tariff changes.Labour Troubles.-Though the Railwaymen belonging to the International Unions have not become involved in the strike, it is reported that the situation in Winnipeg and Western Canada is still grave. The advocates of &quot;one 13ig Union recognise that defeat in the present struggle will mean a permanent set back to their policy. No attempt has apparently been yet made to operate the Street Rail-way at YYinnipeg. On the morning of June 17th many leaders of the Strike movement were arrested in Winnipeg. Mounted police raided the Labour Temple and seized a considerable amount of literature which was described as of a Bolshevik nature.   Arrests were also made at Calgary and other places.Siberian Force. The final contingent of the Canadian Siberian Force has sailed from Vladivostok.Soldiers&apos; Land, Settlement. Five thousand returned&apos; soldiers made application in May for land through the Soldiers&apos; Land Settlement Board and a loan of $6,000,000 has been approved. Applications now total 15,00&quot;, and loans exceed $12,000,000. The largest number of applications is reported from Alberta.AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH.Germans and New Guinea.-r-The Governor-General lias informed the British Government that there is a rumour that Rudolf Wahlen and. Dr. 1 laid, Governor of German New Guinea until shortly before the war, are. arranging to return to -Rabaul in connection with German interests and&apos;possibly bringing plantation assistance.. They are considered as the two ablest Germans available, with great local knowledge of the former German possessions. The Commonwealth Ministers view the rumour with much anxiety, and therefore request the British Government to take the necessary steps to prevent any German leaving Europe at present for Australia or New Guinea.Industrial Situation.--At was reported on June 14th aud &apos; 16th that the shipping strike continued to cause increasing Unemployment and restrictions of industries in all States depending on seaborne coal. There were many signs of resentment against the strike by members of the SeameiPs Union who favoured reference to the Arbitration Court as against those who denounced arbitrations and favoured strike methods. The Adelaide Union steadfastly supported arbitration, and by legal methods resented the Federal Executive of the Seamen&apos;s Union using the Union funds. Strikers were making an effort to induce the waterside workers to make common cause, but so far unsuccessfully. Strikers were endeavouring to force the Federal Government to intervene, but the Government insisted that the seamen had relief ready in an appeal to the Arbitration Court, which, it would appear, the seamen refused to make.The Melbourne Waterside Workers&apos; Federation complain of unfair treatment, and the Federal Government have appointed a Ro3Tal Commission, which is now sitting,8194-3a - A 2
and is enquiring how far promises of support by the Government to Loyalists who intervened in the war-time strikes of the waterside workers have been kept, and other grievances of the Waterside Workers&apos; Union. The industrial situation is very serious.The Broken Hill strike continues. The Registrar of the Commonwealth Arbitra-tion Court has notified the miners&apos; executive that it is intended to call a compulsory conference of parties and he asked if the miners would be bound by the conditions. The miners&apos; executive replied that they would only accept a conference and resume work if all their demands were conceded.NEW ZEALAND.Minister and Social Unrest. The Minister of Customs (Mr. Myers), in a published interview, observes that the Prime Minister (Mr. Massey) ami- Sir Joseph Ward are expected in the Dominion about the middle of July, and that they cannot return too soon in face of the political and social-unrest and the grave financial problems with which New Zealand is confronted.SOUTH AFRICA.End of Parliamentary Session. The Parliamentary Session is likely to terminate on June 20th or 21st.Indian Trading and Land Ownership. The Governor-General has informed the British Government that with regard to the new clause which had been inserted in the Bill dealing with &quot;the ownership . and occupation of land and trading by Asiatics in the,proclaimed mining areas of the Transvaal (vide Report No. 123), the House of Assembly have acquiesced by 55 votes to 22 in the deletion of the new clause by the Senate. The minority consisted of Nationalists, three members of the South African Party, and one Labour member. .-Notwithstanding the deletion of the clause, the Transvaal Indian Association and other smaller Associations are urging the Governor-General to withhold assent. The Governor-General has informed the British Government that, on grounds of high policy, he feels, sure it would be very inadvisable to withhold assent or to reserve the Bill,   lie proposes, therefore, to signify assent.The Income Tax. In the Union House of Assembly on June 5lh during the debate on the income tax proposals, the Minister of Finance (Sir T. Orr) was criticised for failing to introduce special taxation on farmers&apos; incomes as he promised in his Budget speech. In reply to these criticisms, Sir T. Orr laid stress on the difficulties of imposing taxation equitably on farmers and business men. He announced that as the increase of expenditure was almost solely due to the war, he intended to continue the Excess Profits Tax only for the war and a period of six months after. There was, therefore, no ground for fear of the- new industries being permanently&apos;handicapped.Cable Delays. In the blouse of Assembly, the Leader of the Opposition (Sir Thomas Smartt) drew attention to the delays in press cables, ancl pointed out that the result of the Derby was transmitted in a few minutes, and consequently the Govern-meiit must expedite important news of events in Europe which were of the greatest interest to South Africans. The Minister of Finance said the Government had again strongly urged the speediug-up of the cables. Replying to vigorous representations by Sir Thomas Smartt, the Minister said the- Eastern Telegraph Company had pointed &quot;out the enormous increase in Government traffic. In order to reduce the Government cables as far as possible, a system of priority had been established, whereby only really urgent Government messages receive preference.Diamond Cutting Industry.  In the Union House of Assembly on June 6th a debate took place on the Diamond Cutting Bill, which had reached the Committee stage. The question under discussion was the supply of diamonds for cutting-purposes contemplated by the Bill in accordance with the provision mentioned by the Acting Prime. Minister (Mr. Malan) in his speech on the second reading of the measure
on Jnne 2nd, whereby the Government would enforce the sale of stones at current rates by producers in the event of cutters and producers failing to come to an agree-ment. Dr. Davies moved an amendment empowering the Minister to require the mines to make available for sale to cutters such qualities and descriptions of diamonds as were prescribed by the Minister at special prices. Mr. Malan opposed the amend-ment, which, he said, meant that the Government would have to establish a regular diamond-buying department, and also gave the cutters the opportunity of underselling cutters in other parts of the world. Mr. Malan argued that the effect of such a proposal, while benefiting the local cutter, would damage the mining industry as a whole, and he pointed out the practical difficulties in view of the system of selling diamonds in bulk.The Diamond Cutting Bill passed the Committee stage in the House of Assembly on June 10th. Dr. Davies&apos; amendment was negatived by 62 votes to 13. An amendment by Mr. Malan, enabling a small cutter to obtain stones, was adopted. Mr. Malan&apos;s amendment to a subsequent cbause debarring cutters from selling uncut stones, except under a permit whereby they would be enabled to sell to other cutters, was also adopted.Taxation in the Transvaal. The Transvaal Provincial Council has resolved to meet its deficit by an increase in trade licences and a tax on reserved mineral rights.FOREIGN COLONIES, &amp;e. IN AFRICA.GERMAN COLONIES.Defence Minister and Economic Need of Colonies. German Wireless of June 11th reported that, on the occasion of the promotion of a number of non-commissioned officers to the rank of Lieutenant, tke Imperial Defence Minister Noske made a speech in which he stated that, according to the foreign press, the idea was being discussed in Entente circles of giving back to Germany her East African possessions on the conclusion of Peace. In order to avoid all misunderstanding, he stated, it must be pointed out that the restoration of German East Africa alone would not mean an absolutely impartial settlement of the German colonial claims which the Entente assured to Germany on the conclusion of the Armistice by the acceptance of President Wilson&apos;s principles. If the Entente expected to obtain as large an indemnity from Germany as was offered in the German counter-proposals they would have to make a condition in the Peace Treaty, also, which would enable the German people to pay that indemnity. Extensive colonial territories were necessary, the Minister declared, as a support for home industry and as an outlet for that part of the German population which avouM be unable to find a living in Germany.
