BRITISH   EMPIRE   AND   AFRICA   REPORT.SELF-GOVERNING   DOMINIONS.CANADA.Date of Prorogation. It is expected that Parliament will be prorogued about July 1st.The Budget. Prior to the Budget division, the Minister of Finance (Sir Thomas White) took advantage of the Macmaster amendment to make a further comment on the Budget. He stated that of all the loans floated the last Canadian Victory Loan was by far the greatest success. Six hundred and ninety millions were raised, and the amount per capita compared very favourably with amounts raised in American cities of approximately equal size.With reference to income tax criticism, the Finance Minister said the tax was practically. on a similar basis to that of the United States. Were the taxation too high, the effect would be to debar many people from coming into the country.The Alinister attributed the high cost of living to diminished production clue to the war, and to increased consumption, and said that if proper steps were taken to induce the right peple to come to Canada, and if the country produced, worked and saved, they might look to the future with confidence.Following a long and continuous discussion lasting practically a fortnight, the Budget, as brought down by Sir Thomas White, was finally adopted by a vote of 120 to 70, giving the Government a majority of 50. The Macmaster amendment was defeated by. the-same majority.On the amendment the Government lost 14 votes and gained two, while on the actual Budget issue Mr. W. F. Cockshutt (U., Brantford), voted against the Govern-ment, after having previously voted against the amendment.Industrial Situation. The Minister of Immigration ancl Colonisation reported on June 19th that the industrial situation was still serious at Winnipeg, Edmonton, and Vancouver, where &quot; sympathetic strikes &quot; were taking place. Representatives of railway unions who acted as mediators between the Winnipeg strikers ancl the metal employers issued a statement intimating that the form of collective bargaining agreed to by the employers was practically the same as that enjoyed by the railway unions. A number of switchmen, firemen, ancl engineers went out on strike at Winnipeg in defiance of the order of their international officers, ancl the unions proceeded to fill the strikers5 places. Ten strike leaders, four of them foreigners, were arrested on the charge of making seditious utterances.   At Montreal ancl Toronto strikes were still in progress.On June 23rd it was reported from Winnipeg that, following the reading of the Riot Act by Mayor Gray, the city was declared under martial law. Armed mounted police, including the Fort Garry Horse, were called out, and charged a parade which had been forbidden by the Mayor. More than 30 persons were wounded, and one man was killed. The police were attacked with sticks, stones, ancl bricks. When the parade had been broken up, soldiers with fixed bayonets patrolled the streets, all citizens being ordered indoors at night. All the principal points in the city were guarded with machine-guns, while armoured cars were also held in reserve.On June 25th it was reported from Winnipeg that the. general sympathetic strike, which had been proceeding since May 15th, had been called off.Hie strike leaders are being proceeded against for seditious conspiracy, and, in addition, under the Immigration Act, which deals with the deportation of undesirables from, the Dominion.Permanent Force. Before the continuation of the Budget debate in the House of Commons, Major-General S. C. Mewburn, Alinister of Militia, introduced a Bill to amend the Militia Act to provide a permanent force not to exceed 10,000 men, instead of 5,000 as at present constituted.   The Bill was given its first reading.Manufacturers and Tariff Preference. Canadian manufacturers in Convention have strongly endorsed the proposals to increase the tariff preference accorded in
Canada to British goods. Mr. Lloyd Harris, Chairman of the Canadian Mission in London, who is now in Canada, impressed on the Convention the opportunity now existing for foreign trade and the necessity of securing it.Pending By-Elections. The Government and the Opposition are discussing the matter of the by-elections which are pending, in the hope of arriving at an agreement. There are five vacant constituencies, consisting of Glengarry and Stormont, North Ontario, Quebec East, Assiniboia, and one in P.E.I. Mr. Rodolphe Lemieux sits for two seats Gaspe and Maisonneuve-and he will relinquish one of them. Under the present discussions an idea of not contesting these seats exists, the proposal being that the nominee of the Party formerly holding the seat be elected by acclamation. Under this arrangement Glengarry, North Ontario and Assiniboia will be Government seats, while Quebec East, Prince Edward, and Claspe will be Liberal. The difficulty of such an arrangement is that the constituents may not agree.Quebec Elections. The results of the Quebec General Election show that the Liberal Government under Sir Lomer Gouin has been returned to power with a majority of 60.   For the first time two Labour candidates were elected in Montreal.A USTR ALI k N C OMM 0 N WE A LTH.Political Parties. The Acting Prime Minister (Mr. Watt) speaking on June 20th gave an interesting review of the position of political parties in the Commonwealth. He said&apos;: &quot;A great break occurred in the labour organisation in Australia over first conscription issue when Mr. Hughes and a number of other leaders left the Labour Party, putting their country before themselves or their political machine. They left the labour organisation to stand for the Empire. All that was best in the country at the time applauded that courageous action which resulted in the union of forces between the National Labour Party led by Mr. Hughes and the more numerous Liberal Party led by Sir Joseph Cook. For the last two-and-a-half years a Government composed of tho^e component elements has governed the country, and it will become a problem for the people of the country as to how long that union is to continue.&quot; Mr. Watt proceeded : &quot;After experience in Cabinet Councils of the parties and in temporary leadership for 14 mouths, I say that the union ought to be finally confirmed by the people and continued indefinitely. The leaclerless Labour Party is being counselled to its destruction and to the destruction of this country by the rank and file of men espousing Bolshevism. The only safety for the country is the re-affirmation of the union between the National Labour Party and the Liberal Party so that it may be a national party in fact as well as name, and that Australia, when she comes to the cross-roads again, will have only two parties, that which stands for the nobler institutions of the country, and for causes for which the Allies have fought, and on the other side those who worship at false shrines which endanger the peace and stability of the countiy.&quot;Industrial Disputes. In the speech to which reference is made in the preceding-paragraph, Mr. Watt also commented upon the problems ahead relating to the regulation of labour and the reward of labour in the Country. He stated : &quot; We invented, and were perhaps the first country in the world to invent, the machinery and a legislative process for the prevention and settlement of industrial disputes, so that the old barbaric method of striking and force, bringing suffering and misery to innocent as well as guilty, should be removed, and replaced by well-ordered laws, administered hy sound tribunals. For over a decade and a half this country has proceeded through State and Federal parliaments to administer systems of law to give the wage-earner adequate protection and reasonable reward for his labour, so that strikes might be abolished, or if they could not be prevented they might be quickly settled. But a class has arisen in the community that believes that this machinery Avas all wrong, merely because in every case where increased wages or reduced hours were demanded they did not get all that they wanted. Although the machine has made mistakes, the system is an infinitely preferable one to the old system of strikes, the system of trial hy brute force, in which not only the men engaged suffered, but thousands of women and children. The country must be asked to re-affirm the decision for the settlement of disputes by law and order instead of by brute force. The Government will stand for the decision of industrial disputes hy law and order8194-4a A 2
which was the desire of the people expressed by the laws of the country, and will allow no force, however arrogant or powerful, to usurp the functions of government, or to challenge the forces of government.&quot;Demobilisation and Repatriation. The Acting Prime Minister (Mr. Watt) has announced that as a result of the work of Senator Pearce and the staff of officers the whole of the Australian fighting forces now in Great Britain will have embarked for Australia by the end of July, and the depot and headquarters&apos; staff will have left by the end of September. Demobilisation was, however, he said, but the first stage in -the gigantic task of repatriation. The Government had begun a vast repatriation machine in Australia to provide for the re-absorption of the men into civilian life. It had been an entirely new undertaking of which the country had had no experience, and for which it had no precedents, and it had been planned on a wider basis than the schemes of Great Britain, or any of the Dominions. A staff had had to be trained for the work, and the Minister for repatriation had very nigh broken himself in founding the department. Ninety-seven per cent, of the officers engaged in the work of the repatriation department throughout Australia were either returned sailors or soldiers. Returned soldiers were being successfully placed in occupations, and incapacited men trained for new occupations. The arrangements which had been made for providing houses for soldiers and their dependants meant an estimated capital outlay of 25,000,000L Grants made to date to settle soldiers on the land represented a total estimated outlay of from 30 to 40 millions sterling. 190,000 men had been lauded in Australia or were en route. 79,000 were still to embark. The policy of sending Senator Pearce to London to control demobilisation had, he said, been fully justified.Seamen&apos;s Strike. The seamen&apos;s strike is causing widespread distress. There are some prospects of an early settlement.Mr. Ryan and Federal Labour. The Brisbane Labour Party have announced that the Premier of Queensland (Mr. Ryan) has been invited to accept the leadership of the Federal caucus.Labour and Conscription. The Labour Conference has instructed its Inter-State delegates to endeavour to secure the repeal of the compulsory clauses of the Defence Act. Messrs. Catts and Gardiner, Labour members of the Federal House of Representatives, opposed the motion.New South Wales and Repatriation. The New South Wales Minister of Lands (Mr. Ashford) has outlined what the Lands Department has done and proposes to do in settling returned soldieas on the land, in pursuance of the pledge given by the N.S.W. Government in 1916 to settle 5,000 returned men on living areas within a period of two years from the declaration of peace. He supplied the following-figures : 1,550 on intensive farming blocks, 850 on Crown Lands,. 600 on Closer Settlement Areas, and 500 on Irrigation Areas ; the remainder of the 5,000 to be settled by the end ok 1919.NEW ZEALAND.Cable delays. A deputation of the Associated Chambers of Commerce waited on the Postmaster-General on June 17th and protested against the delays on commercial cables. They declared that where commodities were subject to rapid fluctuations in price, business was impossible when homeward cables took seven or eight days and outward cables 12 days or even 24. The Minister held out no hope of an immediate improvement, but promised that the*Government would continue their efforts to bring about a remedy.   He denied that Press messages received undue preference.SOUTH AFRICA.&apos;Repatriation of Enemy Subjects. The Governor-General informed the British Government by telegram on the 20th June that the Repatriation of Enemy Subjects Bill has been withdrawn. The reasons given are twofold, firstly, because the Bill in select Committee was altered for the worse, especialby by the replacement of the
proposed Board by. a Judicial Commission under wbicb it would bare been very difficult to secure convictions ; secondly, the effect of the introduction of the Bill had been that a large number of interned enemy subjects had voluntarily applied for repatriation and had been repatriated, while enemy subjects sent from British territories outside the Union had also been, repatriated. In short the introduction of the Bill had resulted in about 1,100 male enemy subjects being repatriated, &apos; together with 200 women and 235 children. The margin left had been thus reduced to 60 or 70, and of those only a small percentage could be considered dangerous, and the chance of securing convictions against them under the Bill as it stood would have been small. The Union Government therefore concluded that the Bill was not-worth the time and irritation which would result from proceeding with it, and the Leader of the Opposition under the circumstances agreed to the withdrawal.Indian Trading and Land Ownership. The Governor-General has informed the British Government that on June 20th he received representatives of the Transvaal British Indian Association, who came to urge that assent should be withheld from the Bill dealing with Indian trading and land ownership. The Governor-General discussed the matter at great length, and gave it as his private opinion that if the Bill were disallowed, it would be greatly to the disadvantage of the present traders and their successors, and therefore to the community as a whole. The representatives seemed to be impressed, though it is considered that they will feel bound to make a protest of some gravity.The Governor-General has signified his assent to the Bill.Public Welfare and Moratorium Acts. In the Union House of Assembly on June 11th, on the second reading of the Bill amending and extending the operation of the Public Welfare and Moratorium Acts, the Minister of Justice (Mr. De Wet) said that the Bill provided for the continuance of the Governments powers under the Acts in question, including the control of imports and exports, for .12 months after peace. The original proposal for the registration of aliens had been withdrawn owing to Jewish hostility. The main objects of the Bill were to establish safeguards against violence and certain propaganda among the natives, among whom secret agencies were at work. The Minister emphasised the fact that the Government had no intention of hampering legitimate trade union activities.Parliament and Income Tax.: Pensions : Soldier Settlement. -In the Union. House of Assembly on June 1 6th the Income Tax Bill passed the third reading after strong protests against the Excess Profits Tax. A Nationalist amendment referring the Bill back to the Committee was negatived by 18 votes to 18. -The War Pensions. Bill also passed its second reading. The Labour members contended that the revised pension scales were still inadequate. The Unionists welcomed the Bill, but urged an increase of the benefits and also a more effective policy for the settling of ex-soldiers on the land. The Minister of Lands (Colonel Mentz) in the course of his reply pointed out that 611 soldiers had already been so settled.INDIA.Famine. Tire Viceroy reported on June 20th that famine had been declared in part of the- Bankura and Bhagalpur Districts of Bengal and in Bihar and Orissa, respectively. Distress prevailed in Ranadha Estate Ganjam District, Madras Presidency, and was apprehended in part of Murshiclabad in Bengal. Scarcity was reported from one circle in Chittagong Hill Tracts. The numbers on relief were decreasing owing to the rainfall in the Angul District of Bihar and Orissa and in the Bombay Presidency and owing to the agricultural operations in some districts of the Central Provinces and in the Bankura District of Bengal. The recent rain had improved the water supply in many places in the Bombay Presidency. The prospects of standing crops were hopeful in the United Provinces where distress was slight except in Etawah. The numbers relieved were as follows : Bengal : relief works, 7,077 ; test works, 2,650 ; gratuitous relief, .18,071. Bihar and Orissa : relief works, 1,885 ; test works, 6,395 ; gratuitous relief, 13,953. Feudatory States, Orissa : test works, 2,617 ; gratuitous relief, 20,618. United Provinces : test works, 20,423 ; gratuitous; relief, 17,111.   Rajputana, last week revised figures : relief works, 2,910 ; test works
5,582 ; gratuitous relief, 2,451. This week figures : relief works, 1,718 ; test works, 4;647 ; gratuitous relief, 2,400. Ajmer-Merwara (incomplete figures) : gratuitous relief, 37. Central India: Rundelkhand, relief works, 14,200; gratuitous relief, 9,500. Baghelkhand report not. received. Central Provinces : relief works, 18,438 ; test works, 18,232; gratuitous relief, 47,206. Bombay: relief works, 31,610; dependants, 18,939; village works, 5,860; test works, 929:; gratuitous relief, 94,189. Madras : relief works, 46,278; tests works, 1,495; gratuitous relief, 85,518.Home Rule.- The Bombay branch of the National Home Rule League has passed resolutions emphatically dissenting from the Government of India&apos;s reform proposals, which are described as : &quot; Highly retrograde in character, involving the practical abandonment of the more liberal proposals in the Montagu-Chelmsford scheme, denying to the people all control over the purse, nullifying, the spirit of the declaration of August 20th, 1917, and practically negativing the just demand of the people of India for an ample measure of responsible self-government made at three successive Congresses.&quot;
