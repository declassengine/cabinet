BRITISH  EMPIRE   AND   AFRICA  REPORT.SELF-GOVERNING   DOMINIONS.CANADA.Peace Terms in Parliament.-In the House of Commons last week the President of the Privy Council (Mr. N. W. Rowell) read the summary of the Peace terms. The clauses announcing the return to France of Alsace-Lorraine, the reduction of the German army and the trial of the Kaiser were particularly cheered by the members.Representative in United States.- -An announcement was made by Mr. N. W. Rowell in the House of Commons last week concerning the appointment of a permanent Canadian representative at Washington. The Minister said that the question of the status of this official was now being taken up with the Imperial Government, and it was expected that a Washington office would incur an expense of $4,000 and possibly $5,000 monthly. The proposal was a direct result of the success of the Canadian War Mission in the United States capital.Interned Enemy Prisoners. The Dominion Government have represented to the British Government that it is-desirable that 500 interned enemy prisoners should be repatriated as soon as possible. There is particular urgency concerning 200 of these at Vernon, British Columbia, as they may become a source of danger in the event of disturbances which are being organised in that province. There is not accommodation for the prisoners in the Eastern Camps, and the Dominion Ministers ask if they may send the prisoners for deportation by way of the-United Kingdom.Liberals and Protection. The Leader of the Opposition in the Dominion House of Commons (Mr. D. D. Mackenzie) has announced that a National Convention of Liberals will be held at Ottawa on August 5th, 6th and 7th. In a speech delivered on May 10th, Mr. Mackenzie is reported to have declared that he is a Moderate Protectionist and that he recognised that Protection had done much for many Canadian industries. While not in favour of high Protection, he was prepared to deal with facts and not theories.Western Members and Tariff Question. Western members who support the Government have presented the Minister of Finance with their views as to what should be done with the tariffs next session. Some of them speak of their propo-sition as an ultimatum, while others refer to it as the irreducible minimum. The Westerners estimate that what they have asked will affect the revenues to an extent of only $7,000,000. Their proposals, they say, have- had in view not only the farmers and their demands for free implements, but also the working classes generally. The reduction they seek is on the ordinary tariff, not on the tariff and the extra 7-\- per cent, war tax combined.Immigration Bill. The Government Immigration Bill (vide Report No. 118) has passed the Committee stage in&quot;the House of Commons. The amendment, moved by a private member, designed to shut out immigrants from the south-eastern portions of Europe for a. period of five years, was withdrawn, the Minister explaining that officials had declared that such a plan would be difficult to work out. New amend-ments by the Minister were passed, including one to prevent the bringing in of concealed weapons, and another which makes provision for officials to report direct to the Minister when an immigrant advocates the overthrow of any constituted Government by force.Defence Expenditure and Demobilisation. Appropriations to the extent of $350,000,000 will be necessary to defray Canada&apos;s military and naval expenditure during the ensuing year for the purposes of demobilisation and upkeep.
NEWFOUNDLAND.Maintenance of Aerodrome.- -The Newfoundland Government have been informed that the Air Council have been considering the question of the maintenance of Mount Pearl Aerodrome. Though the aerodrome can now be used by aircraft, the improve-ments are estimated to cost 2,000Z. As the annual rental is 600Z. and estimated purchase price 4/JOOZ., the Air Council think it is desirable to purchase. This appears to be the only site in Newfoundland warranting completion as a XDermanent aerodrome, and in view of the development of trans-Atlantic flying, the Council think tt of the utmost importance to maintain and improve this aerodrome. The Council, however, consider that the maintenance of aerodromes in the Dominions should be a matter for the Dominions concerned, and they therefore enquire whether the Newfotmd-land Government would be willing to maintain the aerodrome.AUSTRALIAN  COMMONWEALTH.Indemnity and Pacific Islands : Vieios of Cabinet. The Acting Prime Minister (Mr. Watt), in a statement in Melbourne on May 10th, referred to the Peace terms in relation to disarmament, the League of Nations, the indemnity, and the control of the former German possessions in the Western Pacific. Dealing with the indemnity, Mr. Watt said : &quot; The terms of the treaty as promulgated leave the Ministry in doubt as to how Australia is likely to fare in the financial clean up. The Prime Minister, Mr,. Hughes, as Chairman of the British Indemnity Commission, has carried enormous responsibilities, and has put up a fight-on behalf of the Dominions and British interests generally which I fear is not yet fully appreciated by Australians. No one in Australia can see what the eventual levy upon enemy nations is likely to be, and the Government is not able to judge what proportion of the immediate or7994-3a A 2Up to May 7th more than one-half of the Canadian troops who were in France and England at the. date of the armistice have been repatriated. The total number who have returned to Canada is 144,115, including 14,823 officers and other ranks of the 3rd Division, and 13,088 officers and other ranks of the 1st Division.Numbers in Hospital. During the course of a discussion on the second reading of the Demobilisation and Appropriation Bill in the House of Commons, Major-General S. C. Mewburn said that there are still 1,700 Canadian casualties in hospitals in France, 14,000 in England, and a similar number in the military hospitals in Canada. .New Trading Route.-The inauguration of a Government Montreal-West Indies -Steamship Service has been announced. On this trading route, it is stated, only Canadian-built vessels will be employed, and these will form the nucleus of a Canadian Mercantile Marine. The vessels will carry raw materials, and will immediatelv be placed on the West Indies and South America trade routes. On the return journev they will carry sugar from Havana to Montreal.Shipping and Mercantile Marine: The Minister of Marine, &amp;c. (Mr. Ballantyne) has informed the House of Commons that there are-at present contracts for building 45 steel vessels in Canadian yards, 25 of which are to be completed this year. Shipbuilding is now employing 40,000 men.    ....M.P.&apos;s and their Payment. According to the Ottawa Citizen many Members of Parliament are concerned with the refusal of the Government to comply with a request for an increase of the indemnity to members to 8 1,000. Several Members of Parlia-ment have intimated that they will not vote until the question is settled,Disfranchisement of Military Defaulters. The Government Bill disfranchising defaulters under the Military Service Act removes the franchise for a period of 15 years, and all defaulters are prohibited&apos;from holding office under the Crown, and from becoming members of the House of Commons or the Senate. The only excep^ tions are in cases where the punishment has been carried out and the defaulter has afterwards been made to serve&apos;with the Colours.
deferred payments to be wrung from Germany by the Allies will be allocated to Australia, but if the bill for war loss is not to include the full cost of the Avar, that is to say, if it does not include the war debt resting on us at the finish of the conflict then Australia will be grievously disappointed with the indemnity settlement. In order that there should be no misunderstanding as to what this means, let me sav that if the term &apos; reparation&apos; is merely to cover the actual physical losses in assets due to invasion, or similar forms of destruction plus the capitalisation of war pensions, the vast proportion of reparation payments will go to France. Belgium and Serbia.&quot;As to the former German Islands south of the Equator, Mr. Watt said : &quot; Our information is that we are to get control of the bulk if not all of them under what appears to the Government to be satisfactory mandatory conditions. Some difficulty apparently exists between Great Britain and Australia with respect to at least one of the islands, that is Nauru. Being desirous rather to assist than to intensify such a difficulty, I can only at the present stage say this, that if any distinction is made with respect to the islands in the military occupation of the Australian forces, the people of Australia can scarcely be expected to understand the reason. I believe that further discussion on this important issue may be safely entrusted to the Prime Minister, who is in cable consultation with his Cabinet in Melbourne, but I feel sure that the Australian Parliament will expect a full explanation from the British authorities concerning any attempted differentiation.&quot;Government Control of Coal Mines. In acquiring control of coal mines in New South Wales, the Commonwealth Government have now suspended all contracts of the coal mines for the supply of coal. Production and distribution throughout Australia are now closely related to the shipping supply, and also to Australian industrial needs. The Commonwealth action has prevented serious industrial trouble, and the stagnation of industry iu all Australian cities. The situation has been made more acute by separate influenza quarantine restrictions by the States, now in some cases abandoned, which seriously reduced the distributing efficiency of ships. AU difficulties have now disappeared, and coal production and distribution are proceeding to the full capacity.Shaw Wireless Transaction.- Senator Gardiner and Mr. Tudor (Leader of the Federal Opposition), Mr. Higgs and Mr. King 0&apos;Aualley, who were members of the Cabinet when the Shaw wireless plant was bought, have asked for an enquiry into the transaction by the High Court. The Chief Justice refused the request and said he could readily accept their assurance that each of them had nothing to conceal, but as the matters had been so fully investigated he felt there was no public advantage in accepting their invitation for a further investigation. He also made the comment that the ex-Ministers had made the request after Mr. Jensen, the ex-Minister, had left Australia,SOUTH AFRICA. -Industrial Congress : Control of Mines : Prevention of Strikes : Minimum Wage.  The Industrial Congress meeting at Bloemfontein on May 9th adopted a resolution on the motion of Mr. Bain (one of the Labour leaders deported after the Johannesburg riots in 1913) in favour of the joint control of mines by boards composed of equal numbers of representatives of the unions concerned and the State, while a rider was .also adopted applying the principle to all Government Departments. The Congress further adopted by 65 votes to 21 a resolution endorsing the principle that negotiations between all the parties should be carried to the pjoint of exhaustion before a strike is precipitated.The Congress also passed a resolution that the principle of sectional strikes should be condemned and recommending the withholding of support in cases of strikes not first endorsed or recognised by the Central Trades Union authority.The Congress further adopted a resolution demanding legislation for securing all white workers a minimum wage consistent with the necessary standard of comfort for whites and their families in South Africa. An amendment &apos;to include coloured -workers was negatived.British Subjects of Russian Origin. The Union Ministers have enquired whether the British Government object to the issue of passports for the United Kingdom to naturalised British subjects of Russian origin and whether passports issued by the
s130Russian Consul to persons Qf Russian nationality desiring to enter the United Kingdom may receive the necessary visa. It is pointed out that some of the applicants have served with the Union forces.Municipal Elections in Johannesburg. The Municipal by-elections to fill 12 vacancies caused by resignations following the strike of the power station employees were held on May 7th. In all, 9 Labour members were elected, and there are now 21 Labour members on the Council.INDIA.Riots. The Viceroy informed the India Office on May 7th that no further disturbances had been reported in the Punjab. . Further snowball postcards had been found addressed either,to Hindus .or Muhammadans or both. Hissar had reported that two student agitators were attempting to stir up disaffection among the dais. Agitation and spreading of false rumours continued, but quiet continued elsewhere. The Muhammadan situation remained as before. According to a report from an Afghan source, Indfan agitators had pledged themselves to incendiarism and attack on mechanical transport and aircraft. It was reported that Gandhi would order another black Sunday.In a telegram of May 9th the Viceroy reported that Lahore and Amritsar were quiet, and that a propaganda column had held six darbars with excellent effect. In the Lahore Mall case, the four accused had been sentenced to transportation for life, and forfeiture of property ; in the Aulakh case, three men had been sentenced to death arid-five to transportation for life. All was reported quiet elsewhere, though the Muhammadan situation gave rise to anxiety.Famine. The Viceroy reported on May 9th that famine had been declared in one more Taluka Koregaou in Satara District, and scarcity in the A mod Taluka of Broach District, Bombay Presidency. The distribution of gratuitous relief had been sanctioned on a small scale in part of Cawnpore -and Harcloi Districts, United Provinces. The numbers relieved were: Rajputana, last week figures : relief works 689, test works 2,127. Ajmer-Merwara, last week figures : gratuitous relief 2,997. Bombay : relief works (figures incomplete) 37,506, village works 7,950, test works 2,349, gratuitous relief 82,882. Madras: relief works 16,723, test works (figures incomplete) . 6,000, gratuitous relief 41,544. Reports from other affected provinces not received.The situation in Bombay had been aggravated by the inadequacy of rice imports consequent on the shortage of tonnage. The controlled price of rice in Rangoon h ad been raised in order to bring out the stock of paddy held up country.OTHER COLONIES, PROTECTORATES, &amp;c.EGYPT.Progress of the Situation. From Egypt itself there is practically nothing to report. The Extr eniist agitators continue to urge officials to strike again, but the latter show no signs of responding, and it is probable that they have learnt a salutary lesson. As.was to be expected, El Azhar continues to be the centre of agitation. The only active demonstrations recorded are those made by Azharites and students in the streets of Cairo. General Allenby reports that owing to the refusal of the students to return to work, he has issued an order closing the schools. He telegraphed on the 11th to say that unless the situation altered he should discontinue his regular daily reports. This affords gratifying evidence of the improvement in the internal situation of the country. The latest telegrams show that the recognition of the Protectoratcby the (united. States, and the publication of the peace terms, by which Germany is required to recognise the Protectorate, have thrown Extremists into the deepest depression.
In Paris&apos; &quot;the Egyptian Delegation&quot; (who, it must be remarked, are welt supplied with funds) have not met with much success although they have been very active. They have not been received in French official circles, nor have they received any encouragement from the leading French newspapers. They are; conducting a violent anti-British, campaign, alleging that British troops have committed atrocities in Egyptian villages, and have even produced faked photographs m support of their allegations. This is not escaping the attention of the competent. authorities, and General Allenby is being kept fully informed of the activities of the Nationalists inFOREIGN COLONIES, &amp;c. IN AFRICA.GERMAN COLONIES.Views of German Government. Sir W. Townley reported on April 29th that he had learnt that in the opinion of the German Government the German Colonial possessions should be returned to Germany but that the Government would be willing to admit certain alterations of territory. If the administration of the German Colonies by the League of Nations under a mandatory system meant that the Colonial possessions would be administered by other nations to the exclusion of Germany, the German Government were not authorised to discuss the question. It was understood that this involved that the German Government might be empowered to discuss the future administration of the German Colonies if Germany herself should have some part in administration under the League of Nations. While Germany was aware that she could not hope to recover German South-West Africa, she attached importance to the retention of East Africa, Togoland, and the Cameroons, and hoped later to purchase some of the Portuguese Colonies.
