BRITISH  EMPIRE  AND  AFRICA  REPORT.IMPERIAL AFFAIRS.The Transfer of German Colonies. Assuming that the conquered German colonies will be incorporated within the British Empire, a Memorandum has been prepared for the War Cabinet as a result of discussions at the Colonial Office at which Sir R. Garran and Sir D. Graaff at ere present, as representing Australian and South African interests. Suggestions are made in this Memorandum as to certain articles which should be included in the Treaty of Peace, and amongst other points the following are dealt with : As to the European inhabitants, it is suggested that all Europeans Avho were members of the military forces, or employed by the civil GoA^ernment at the outbreak of AArar, should&apos;be , returned to Germany at once; while other German inhabitants should be given 12 months to dispose of their immoA^able property, and then AvithdraAV from the territory. Those Germans who were formerly resident but not present in the territories at the date of peace should not be permitted to return. It is further suggested that&apos; notwithstanding the above, the authorities in control of any ceded territory should haA^e poAArer to exempt any persons affected. The reason for this suggestion is in order to leaA&apos;e the dispensing power in the hands of the Government which Avill be responsible for the administration of the transferred territory, e.g., the CommonAvealth in the case of German New Guinea and the Bismarck Archipelago, and the Union Government, in the case of South-West Africa.Regarding Government and municipal property, it is suggested that all property belonging to the German Government should pass Avithout compensation to the GoArernments acquiring the territories. The property belonging to a municipality or other public body Avould pass without compensation to the authorities appointed to carry on the work of such body. Private interests in railways, harbours, wharves, telegraphs, lighting and water undertakings, being the property of the GoA^ernment or municipalities, would&apos; be extinguished, and compensation, if any, would be the subject of a separate agreement. This suggestion is made in view of the fact that there are railways in South-West Africa, the British portion of Togoland, and German East Africa, which, though the property of the German GoA^ernment, are leased to private companies ; and it is desired that the leases should be extinguished. As the&quot; German Government hold the majority of shares in the Central Railway in German East Africa, Avhich is nominally a private undertaking, it is desired that this railway should be dealt with in accordance with the above-e-mentioned terms relating to private interests.As to financial liabilities contracted by the German Government, it is suggested that these should not pass to the Governments acquiring the territories, with the exception of liability for deposits in the Government Land Bank in South-West Africa, provided, hoAvever, that the assets of this Bank under the control of the German Government were transferred to the Government assuming liability.SELF-GOVERNING  DOMINIONS.CANADA.Meeting of Parliament: Forecast of Legislation. The Dominion Parliament will meet on February 20th. Forecasts of the Speech from the Throne contain important legislation relating to reconstruction in the Dominion, and include various measures designed to promote the material prosperity as well as the health of the people throughout the country.
No Prospect of Election. The Minister of Immigration and Colonisation (Mr. J. A. Oalder), speaking last week before the Canadian-Club at Toronto, referred to the prospects of a General Election in the following terms : &quot; There is not a single member of the Government who . does not believe it to be criminal to force an election on the people during the next few months. There is too much at stake. The immediate problems which the nation has to lace are too important for us to play polities just now, so far as the Government is concerned, and there is not the slightest tendency in that direction at this time. We hope to continue till the men are home, so far as Parliament permits. In my judgment, there should be no election in this country until the soldiers are back.&apos;1Sympathy with Sinn Fein Movement: Meeting in Montreal.- Strong praise for the Sinn Fein movement and ideals, and passionate demands that a full measure of national liberty be granted to Ireland were expressed at a meeting of Canadian-Irishmen held at Montreal last week. The demonstration, which was attended by a large number of representative Irishmen, unanimously adopted a resolution insisting that it was expedient, in the general readjustment of European affairs at the Peace Conference, that &quot; the cause of Ireland and her future should be taken into consideration, with a view to securing for her the same rights, guarantees and liberties as were enjoyed by the small nations of Europe,&quot; and demanding that &quot;such rights take the form of self-government.&quot; Copies of the resolution are to be forwarded to Sir Robert Borden, Mr. C. J. Doherty and Lord Shaughnessy in London, and also to President Wilson -and General Botha. The meeting was addressed by Mr. E. B- Devlin, M.P. for Wright constituency, Dr. J. K. Forau, of Ottawa, Mr. C. J. Foy, LLC, of Perth, and several others. Dr. Foran, who was the chairmanv read a letter from Sir Wilfrid Laurier, who said : &quot;You may be certain that whatever is satisfactory to you and your friends in Montreal will be eminently satisfactory to me.&quot; A message from Mr. Henri Bourassa, the Nationalist leader, was also acknowledged, but was not read. An extract from this letter given to the Press later stated : &quot; By principle, conviction and sympathy, I am heart and spirit with all true Irishmen who claim for their noble and heroic Motherland the fulness of her national independence.&quot;Grain Growers and Tariffs. At the annual meeting of the Manitoba Grain Growers&apos; Association held last week a considerable difference of opinion manifested itself during the debate dealing with tariffs.An attempt was made to force the Convention to declare in favour of the &quot; abolition&quot; instead of the &quot; revision &quot; of tariffs, as called for in the platform of the Canadian Council of Agriculture. This evoked strong opposition, many delegates expressing themselves as being opposed to the more drastic policy.Another matter over which sharp dissension occurred was that of the alternative taxation proposals, one of the speakers declaring that the taxation of unimproved land values and natural resources was equivalent to supporting the &quot; policies of Winnipeg Bolshevists.&quot;Resolutions passed by the Convention, however, expressed adherence by Manitoba farmers to much the same.policies as those contained in the platform, of the Canadian Council of Agriculture.Government Merchant Marine. Announcement is made of the incorporation of the Canadian Government Merchant Marine, Limited, with a capitalisation of f 1,000,000 and head offices in Toronto. &quot; .The company is authorised to own and operate steamships with necessary docks and equipment.   It will operate in conjunction with the Canadian National Railways.Delegates for International Labour Conference. Mr. Gustave Francq, of Montreal, has left Canada for England where he will join Mr. P. M. Draper (Secretary of the Trades and Labour Congress) both of whom will, represent Canada at the Inter-national Labour Conference. The Canadian delegates will join Mr. Samuel Gompers and other United States representatives in London, where a Conference will be held with the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress on January 20th.Women and Seats in Parliament.-At an executive meeting of the Canadian National Council of Women it was unanimously resolved that seats in the Federal Parliament should be open to women.
Unemployment and Employment Exchanges. The Director of the Provincial Labour Bureau at Montreal declares that the closing down of munition factories is resulting in considerable unemployment.&quot; So far as domestic labour is concerned,&quot; he says, &quot;there is always a call for it, and I can place anybody who wants a job, but the industrial market shows a surplus of labour in comparison with the demand.&quot;The Minister of Immigration and Colonisation reports that the Department of Labour is making a canvass of the Unemployment situation in the lumbering and mining industries, which are believed to be able to absorb much surplus unskilled labour during the present winter. The work of organising a Dominion-wide system of employment agencies is proceeding rapidly and. will be completed early in January. The authorities of the Maritime Provinces not having seen their way to co-operate with the Dominion Government, the Federal authorities are taking complete charge, and a chain of offices, with a clearing house at Halifax, Nova Scotia, is to be established by them.Earnings of Railways. The gross earnings in 1918 of the principal Canadian railways are reported by the Minister of Immigration and Colonisation to have set a new high level in the history of Canada, having reached a total upwards of $272,000,000. This represents an increase of $23,500,000 over the previous year&apos;s total, and of-nearly $ 100,000,000 over that for the year 1911. The figure for the Grand Trunk Railway System showed an increase last year of nearly 22 per cent. ; the Canadian Northern Railway registered a gain of over 14 per cent. ; and the Canadian Pacific Railway 3  per cent.Mineral Production. The total value of the minerals produced in the Dominion last year was $220,000,000. The total for the year 1917 was $189,000,000. The production of coal last year amounted to 15,180,000 tons as compared with 14,046,000 tons in 1917. The gold production was valued at $14,750,000 in 1918, and at $15,272,000 in the previous year.Plans for Demobilisation. The Acting Prime Minister (Sir Thomas White) states that &quot; Complete plans for demobilisation and the return to Canada of the Canadian Expeditionary Force, and the wives and other soldiers&apos; dependants overseas, have-been worked out between the Militia Department here and the Overseas Minister in consultation with Lieut.-Gen. Sir Arthur Currie and other military authorities overseas. Having regard to the available amount of shipping, the limitations of the railway facilities from the Canadian Atlantic ports, and the fact that in addition to the forces overseas there are women and children dependants to the number of 50,000 to be brought over, the task is both heavy and^ditficult.AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH.Ministerial Changes. The following Ministerial changes have been made in the Federal Government : Mr. W. Massy Greene succeeds Mr. J. A. Jensen as Minister for Trade and Customs ; Senator E. J. Russell administers the Department of Defence with the assistance of the Mr. G. H. Wise during the absence of Senator Pearce. Mr. Alexander Poynton assists with repatriation and continues to control shipbuilding. The Acting Minister for the Navj-, Mr. R, B. Orchard, voluntarily retires at the end of the month when recruiting comes to an end.Oilfields of Papua. A proposal has been made by the Government of the Australian Commonwealth that the British Government should co-operate in proving the oilfields of Papua which are believed to be of great value. At a recent meeting held at the Colonial Office, the Commonwealth Minister for the Navy (Sir Joseph Cook) emphasised the view.which is widely held in Australia that the territory should not be exploited by any of the large oil companies of which several have applied for permission to prospect. In the course of a Memorandum submitted to the War Cabinet by the Colonial Office, dated January 10th, it is recognised that the Govern-ment should not, except in special circumstances, engage in speculative undertakings, but it is considered that this objection does not necessarily attach to the preliminary
investigation of the potentialities of a held of prime Imperial importance where corn-petition with private interests would not be involved. After consultation with the Admiralty, Board of Trade, and the Treasury, the Colonial Office Memorandum states that it was agreed to recommend the Government to co-operate to the extent of 50,000L on the understanding that a similar sum should be provided by Australia. The whole question would be considered de novo if and when oil should be found in&quot; commercial quantities.Gold Production : Proposed Bounty. The Acting Prime Minister (Mr. Watt), interviewed regarding the proposed bounty to encourage the production of gold, said : &quot;I observe from the Press report that the municipal mining interests of Bendigo have cabled to the Prime Minister, asking him to support a movement for the grant of a bonus of 1Z. an ounce on gold, and that Mr. Hughes is siipposed to have replied in the following terms : &apos; Your cable re gold-mining industry received, quite appreciate gravity of position, will make immediate representations along lines urged.&apos; &quot; Mr. Watt continued : &apos;&apos; I have no official information other than what the Press affords of this correspondence, but in July of last year the Cabinet con-sidered what appears to be the same request, then made by the Chamber of Mines of Victoria, and decided that it could not approve of the proposition. Nothing has occurred, since then that I am aware of to warrant the Government amending its view, but I think there are still very, many economic, financial and political considerations against the proposal.&quot;Equipment of A.I.F. -The Commonwealth Minister for Defence (Senator Pearce), contends that the A.IF. is the best equipped, fed and clothed force raised for war service in any part of the world. It was transported over a greater distance than any other army, excepting that of New Zealand.Aerial Service beticeen London and Australia.-A company named &quot;The Aerial Services, Limited,&quot; has been registered for the purpose of establishing a service between London and Australia. An expedition is forming a chart route via Darwin, the Dutch East Indies, India and Baghdad (vide Report No. 100).Control of Wool. The Acting Prime Minister (Mr. Watt) states that the Commonwealth Ministry is not likely to extend the control of wool bevond June 1920.NEW ZEALAND.French Mission. The French Mission received a warm welcome on their arrival at Auckland.By-Eleciions. The results of the by-elections for Wellington South and Palmerston North, rendered vacant by the deaths from influenza of Mr. A. H. Hind-marsh, M.P., and Mr. D. Buick, M.P.,&apos;are as follows :  Wellington South, R. Semple (Labour), 2,412 ; F. Frost (Govt.), 1,281; J. Castle. 397. Palmerston North, J. A. Nash (Govt.), 2,229 ; A. Galbraith (Labour), 1,914- ; E. H. Crabb (Prohibition), 1,119.SOUTH AFRICA.Prime Minister on German Colonies and Republicanism. Before leaving for the Peace Conference the Prime Minister (General Botha) made some important public references to the future of the German Colonies and to the Republican movement in South Africa. He said: &quot;So far as South Africa is concerned we believe that the German Colonies ought not to be given back to Germany. The Germans, even after long occupation, have never developed them. There is next to no European popu-lation, and German treatment of the natives, especially in German South-West Africa, endangers the whole position of the Union. The repetition of this cannot be tolerated in South Africa, where we have a vast population of natives who must be treated fairly ^and decently, and who must haA^e the opportunity for that development which was quite out of the question under German domination.&quot;As to the Republican movement in South Africa, General Botha saicT: &quot; With regard to this matter, -General Hertzog has himself said in South Africa that it is impracticable without the assent of the British section, and he added that he would ask his followers not to press the point, but to wait iuntil the British section were at one with them.   This was about a j^ear ago.   The standpoint I have taken
from the beginning is that it is impossible to have a Republic of South Africa without? a bloody war,, unless you get all sections to agree to it. As far as I can see there is not the least likelihood of an agreement on this question, and I am quite sure of this, that there is nothing to be gained by war in this direction. We are living to-day under a Constitution not forced upon us, but drafted by South African statesmen, and agreed to by the Imperial Parliament, a Constitution where we can deA^elop our free will in the best way for our country.&quot;Gold Production. In the course of a statement issued at the beginning of the month, the President of the Chamber of Mines (Sir E. Wallers) observed that the summary of the report of the Committee on Gold Production, so far as it advised against an increased price for gold, or the grant of a subsidy for its production, was in line with the views placed before the Select Committee of the Union Rouse of Assembly by the Transvaal Chamber of Mines. He continues : &quot; It will be remembered that the Chamber&apos;s evidence was opposed to either method, but it did urge and I want again to emphasise this point that a reduction of the charge of 25s. per cent, made by the Bank of England for freight and insurance on the transport of gold from South Africa should be arranged. The Chamber contended that as other producers of essential war requirements such as wool, mealies, &amp;c, were given special facilities and rate for their products, it was only reasonable that gold, which, as has been stated repeatedly by the Imperial Government, was a vital war requirement, should receive similar consideration. The Chamber did not suggest that the rate of 25s. per cent, was necessarily an excessive rate under the conditions prevailing, but it did suggest that the peculiar disabilities under which the gold-mining industry has laboured during the war should be recognised in the manner proposed.&quot;Sir E. Wallers adds : &quot; At certain stages of the war it might have been possible for the mines, if they had so desired, to sell their gold direct to America in the same way as certain Australian gold has been sold, but for all practical purposes it is obvious that the mines had no alternative but to accept whatever terms were laid down by the Bank of England, which presumably acted with the authority of the Imperial Government. The Imperial Government did not take advantage of the restriction of markets for the wool growers of Australia and South Africa to penalise these producers, but in the case of the gold-mining industry less was paid for its products by reason of the Bank of England&apos;s 25s. rate. Practically every other essential industry obtained more for its services during the war.&quot;INDIA.(Excluding External Affairs, which are dealt with in the Eastern Report.)National Congress. In continuation of the account of the proceedings at the National Congress which appeared in the Report of last week (No. 101), cables sent to the Press on December 31st reported that the session of the Congress concluded on that date. At this last meeting Messrs. Tilak, Gandhi and Hassan Imam obtained a nominal xnajcTrity for their appointment to represent India at the Peace Conference. The Congress, after exjuessing disapproval of the excess profits tax, appointed a committee to draft an address of congratulation to. the King-Emperor on the successful termination of the war and a petition to the British Parliament demanding self-determining rights for India. The committee was also charged with the selection of the members of the deputation to Great Britain. The President, in his reply on the discussion, appealed for Hindu and Moslem unity. The proposal to hold the next Congress in London was abandoned.Strike at Bombay. The Viceroy informed the Secretary of State by telegram of January 9th that the Government of Bombay reported that mill hands had started an extensive strike that morning, the number of strikers being estimated at 100,000. The proceedings had been orderly vip to that time except that in the north of the island some disturbances had occurred between Hindu and Muhammadan strikers. On January 13th it was reported that the strike was spreading, and that a collision with the police, resulting in some injuries, occurred on January 11th. The mill area Avas piqueted with troops. -
