BRITISH  EMPIRE   AND   AFRICA  REPORT.SELF-GOVERNING   DOMINIONS.CANADA.Labour Troubles. Although messages during last week-end indicated that the strike trouble in Winnipeg had taken a more hopeful turn, later cablegrams announced that Calgary trade unionists had called for a general sympathetic strike, while the Labour Union at Edmonton had voted for a strike on May 27th. There is also labour unrest in. Montreal, where a general cessation of work is threatened unless the metal workers are granted an eight-hour day. It is reported that in Toronto a vote has been given in favour of calling a general strike on May 28th.The Militia Minister stated in Parliament that the troops in Winnipeg would not be used as strike-breakers, but would only act in conformity with the Militia Act in case of rioting.   The military units there are filled with volunteers.The Great War Veterans&apos; Association, which had offered to arbitrate in the strike, demand the deportation of all men wielding Bolshevik influence in the Unions.The Brotherhood of Railway Trainmen, in convention at Cleveland, Ohio, have prohibited their members at Winnipeg from voting on the strike question.On his return to Ottawa, the Prime Minister (Sir Robert Borden) indicated in the course of a statement in the House of Commons that the Government were determined that law and order should be maintained and that the public services must not be dislocated under the conditions now obtaining at Winnipeg.Question of Titles. The House of Commons have voted in favour of sending an address to His Majesty the King requesting him to refrain hereafter from conferring any title, honour or titular distinction upon Canadians, save appellations of a professional or vocational character.The resolution also asks for the extinction of hereditary titles heretofore conferred on subjects ordinarily resident in Canada on the death of the present holders. &quot; .Accepting the Report of the Special Committee on the titles question, the House did not recommend the discontinuance of the awards of military or naval decorations, such as the Victoria Cross or the Military Cross. It did, however, cad for legislation to prohibit the acceptance or the use of titles or titular distinction conferred by foreign rulers or Governments.The members rejected by a vote of 96 to 43 an amendment which would have confined the address to a request that the conferring of hereditary titles be discontinued, and that existing titles be extinguished upon the death of the present holders.Neio Shipping Route.  Operating under the title of the &quot; Compagnie Canadienne Trans-Atlantique,&apos;; a new shipping route is being established between France and Canada.The new company is jointly controlled by the Canada Steamship Lines in conjunction with the Compagnie Generale Trans-Atlantique. The latter company undertakes to secure Canadian business throughout France, while the Canada Steamship Lines will supply through their Canadian organisation the necessary East-bound traffic.The new company will inaugurate a service of- six freight steamers, of which number three will be supplied by French interests, the Canadians providing the remainder.&apos; Tne first vessel to sail will be the Bilbster, which will leave Montreal on May 25th.   Bookings will follow every 10 days.It is also understood that a passenger service will be inaugurated in 1920.Trade Conditions. The Minister of Immigration and Colonization reports that wholesale-and retail trade conditions continue excellent, and the favourable Western crop outlook gives confidence to business. The prevailing strikes are, however, causing a feeling of depression in industrial circles.
Mr. Lloyd Harris, Chairman of the Canadian Trade Mission in London, declares -that the prospects for Canada&apos;s foreign trade are very bright, but that the need for the provision of ships is imperative. The Canadian Trade Commissioner in Australia also reports a fine opening in that country for Canadian trade.Cost of Food. The Dominion Minister of Labour (Senator G. D. Robertson), speaking in the Senate, at Ottawa, said that the high cost of food in the Dominion is due chiefly to the scarcity of food in the country, and that relief was to be expected only from greater production on the farms, his figures showing that there are not large food supplies in storage.Settlers from United States. The Minister of Immigration and Colonization (Mr. James A. Calder) expresses the opinion that between 75,000. and 100,000 American settlers will enter Canada during the present year.Technical Education. A Bill has been introduced into the Dominion Parliament to distribute among the various Provinces 10,000,000 dollars to promote technical education.Goal Supplies. According to the Report on the Coal Trade of the Dominion for the year ended March 31st, 1918, issued by the Dominion Bureau of Statistics, Canada is abundantly supplied with good coal, but its central areas, in which the country&apos;s larger industrial organisations have been developed, are practically devoid of either bituminous or anthracite deposits, the coalfields lying at the extreme ends of a line 3,000 miles, one on the Atlantic coast and the&quot;other in the Par &quot;West. The result is that the great mass of the country&apos;s industry and the bulk of its population are dependent for fuel upon the United States.NEWFOUNDLAND.Cabinet Changes. The Governor of Newfoundland telegraphed on May 23rd that, the National Government had been dissolved by the resignation ot Sir W. Llojd as Prime Minister (vide also Report No. 120). The resignation had been accepted on May 22nd, and the late Minister of Finance (Sir M. Cashin) became the new Premier, Mr. Bennett Colonial Secretary, and Mr-. Mori no Minister of Justice. The other offices, it was stated, remained unchanged.AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH.Japan and the Commonwealth. In a speech delivered in connection with the Empire Day celebrations, the Acting Prime Minister (Mr. Watt) said that before the war there was a prejudice in Australia against the Japanese who were regarded as an inferior race. That feeling was not fully eradicated even now. Mr. Watt continued :  &apos;: With a full sense of the responsibility of the position I hold, I say that we do well to cherish the friendship of Japan and to acknowledge it publicly in the halls of this country. All through the four years and more of the war Japan, on the wide waters of the Western Pacific, was the only sentinel of our boys on their way to the battle-field. Any man who says that such friendship can be brushed aside with a sneer pays no attention to the accumulated experience of the ages.&quot;Imperial Partnership. Referring in the above-mentioned address to the organisation of the British Empire, Mr. Watt said that whatever happened to the League of Nations the power would still be in the hands of the British, French and American peoples, whose reported alliance was welcome. Never had there been a. nation so loosely linked together as the British Empire. Mr. Watt proceeded :  &quot; There is no organic tie, but now we have been admitted as partners at the peace table it is our duty not merely as Australians, but as Britishers, to do everything in our power to help in the solidification and the making permanent of that partnership. It may be said that we are breathing the spirit of the organic federation of the Empire. What if we are ? Is there any reason why we should not be linked organically with the mother who bore us ? If we are to continue to be a great nation we must draw more closely together the ties of affection, of commerce, of finance and of Government. For our self-preservation we depend on the partnership with Great Britain. The British Empire will ever be the sheet anchor of education and civilisation.&quot;
Seamen&apos;s Strike. The seameii&apos;s troubles which have been smouldering -in Brisbane for some time have now developed into a strike in which the Sydney and . Melbourne seamen are joining. The strike affects only the Australian coastal trade and the Commonwealth line. The seamen of the coastal trade work under an Arbitration Court Award which the seamen now denounce.All inter-State shipping is under Government management with Admiral Clarkson controlling it. Admiral Clarkson refuses to negotiate with the seamen on the grounds that an Arbitration Court Award is current, and that grievances should be submitted to the Court.The Acting Prime Minister (Mr. Watt) declines to intervene, but is prepared to receive a statement of the seamen&apos;s grievances. Unionist opinion is divided. The Sydney and Melbourne Unions have been over-ruled by extremists. The Adelaide Union resents the strike and seeks by legal remedy to prevent the use of Union funds for strike pay.The stoppage of shipping seriously affects industries owing to the shortage of coal in all centres outside New South Wales caused by war conditions and influenza, quarantines.   There were hopes on May 23rd of intervention by the Court and that the divided opinion of the seamen would shorten the strike.   The Broken Hill mines continue completely closed.      - .Flax Crop.--The Commonwealth Government informed the British Government on May 15th that they had decided to accept the offer of the War Office to purchase the 1919 flax crop at 170Z. per ton, c:i:f., United Kingdom ports.NEW ZEALAND.&quot; National Government : Liberals and General Election. The result of a meeting of all the liberal Members of Parliament, over which the acting leader (Mr. W. I). S. Macdonald) presided, has been announced in the Press. It is stated that the meeting-resolved unanimously that, while lo37ally abiding by the existing party compact, the Liberals will contest the General Election separately from the Reform Party with a definite progressive Radical policy.Referring to the decision of the Liberals to resume a separate existence before the elections the Dominion says that public opinion is against dragging politics hack to the old ruts and grooves. There is a rising demand for great reforms, which are impossible without a union of the national forces.The New Zealand Times says that the National Government rendered valuable-war service, but the necessities of post-war reconstruction forbid further compromise. It welcomes the decision as proving that the coalition has failed to impair the Liberals&apos; loyalty to Liberal principles.The Post says that the door has been definitely banged, not merely against an extension of the compact, but also against negotiations for political reconstruction, to which the reformers&apos; advances pointed. The public, wdio dislike a reversion to party strife on the old lines, are likely to enforce some measure of reconstruction, whatever the politicians decide. The dissensions of the old parties promise to give increased power to Labour.Some Features of the Licensing Referendum.- An analysis of the unofficial figures of the Licensing Referendum, which was published in the Ghristchurch Press of April .1 I i,b, shows that 43 electorates voted in favour of No-licence, and 33 in favour of Continuance. This majority of electorates in favour of No-licence was largely secured in Otago, where not a single electorate voted in favour of Continuance, though two of the Southland electorates Wakatipu and Wallace- did so. Another feature of the poll was that four of the &quot;dry&quot; electorates-Ohinemuri, Masterton, Wellington South, and Ashburton cast majorities against Prohibition.SOUTH AFRICA.Gold Mines. The Union Ministers have informed the British Government that the figures of working profits and losses for the three months ended February 28th disclose a most serious situation on the Witwatersand Gold Mines. This position is due to the rise in costs and decreasing- supply of native labour in 1918, which was
much accentuated during the last few mouths. The closing down of a number of important mines is therefore imminent; this would involve a large reduction of gold output and serious local unemployment. The co-operation of the British Government is therefore asked on the lines of a previous suggestion in favour of paying to the Onion Government for the assistance of the poorer mines 7s. 6d. percentage of 11. 5s. on the value of the bullion retained by the Bank of England in respect of freight and insurance. The Union Ministers also wish to know the views of -the British Government as to whether the industry might obtain better prices by selling . direct to the United States or other markets.Indian Trading and Land Ownership.-!!! the House of Assembly on the second reading of the Bill dealing with the ownership and occupation of land and trading by Asiatics in the proclaimed mining areas of the Transvaal (vide Report No. .120), Mr. Patrick Duncan admitted that the Bill brought no&apos; finality to the Asiatic question but said finality was impossible and the Bill was a compromise. He could not advocate unrestricted Asiatic trading, and it was their duty as trustees for future European generations to take safeguards in this connection, while recognising the European and Asiatic to the advantage of both. He supported the measure as inflicting the minimum hardship on other inhabitants of the Transvaal, and urged that the provisions should be widened with a view to restricting the spread of Asiatic traders to the country districts.The second reading of the Bill was passed unanimously.Views of Transvaal Indians. With reference to the Bill dealing with Indian Trading, &amp;c. (vide preceding paragraph and Report No. 120) the Transvaal British Indian Association have expressed great alarm at the prospect of the imposition of further liabilities upon Indians at this stage of their history. They had hoped, it is stated, that the time was ripe for the removal of old disabilities instead of the imposition of new ones, and they appeal for support and co-operation.Soldiers and their Dependants Provision of Pensions, &amp;c. The Select Committee of the Union House of Assembly which has been considering the provision to be made for the South African forces, has presented a draft Bill consolidating the recent and past pension laws. The most noteworthy feature of the Bill is that though primarily intended for the benefit of. returned soldiers concerned in the present war and their dependants, the Dutch burghers and all who participated on either side during the Boer or other wars in South Africa are included on an equal basis. The details of the Bill are elaborately worked out. The Committee in a further report recommends, firstly, the formation of a Standing Commission on the lines of the Cost of Living Commission to deal with unemployment; secondly, the convening of a congress comprising both employers and employed to consider questions relating to disabled soldiers who have undergone vocational training and apprenticeship ; and, thirdly, the extension by the Government of vocational training institutions.INDIA.Effect of Afghan Menace. In a telegram dated May 21st from the Viceroy (Foreign Department) to the Secretary of State an appreciation of the problem of the Afghan menace to India is given. In the course of the observations it is observed that it would be difficult to exaggerate either the degree of Afghan provocation or (had it not been grappled with resolutely) the seriousness of the Afghan menace. The peculiar gravity of both the provocation and the menace lay in Amanulla&apos;s attempt to secure unity at home by combining Jehad and Indian agitation against the Rowlatt Bill into an anti-British conflagration embracing Afghanistan, the frontier, and India.Dealing with other matters affecting the internal conditions of India the Viceroy remarks that the rapidity with which Peshawar responded to the Afghan postmasteFs machinations is some indication of the situation with which the Government would have been confronted if Northern India had become flooded with seditious propaganda such, as the Afghan postmaster and envoys, and doubtless other Afghan agents in India, had been officially instructed to distribute.7994-do B
So far as the effect on Moslem India is concerned, the following passage occurs in the &quot;viceroy&apos;s telegram : &quot; The Afghan war has not affected it prejudicially, but distinctly the reverse. We cannot answer for the effect of prolonged hostilities, but it is safe to say that nothing could be more calculated to prejudice feeling in India than any policy which in the face of public challenge and the inherited dread of Afghan invasion could be interpreted as weakness.&quot;Famine. The Viceroy reported to the India Office on May 23rd that scarcity had beemdeclared in Janjgir and Baihar Tahsils of Bilaspur and Balaghat districts in the Central Provinces, and famine in the Kallikota and Atagada estates in Ganjam District, Madras Presidency. Khondmals Sub-Division, Angul District, Bihar and Orissa, had been put under test. Distress was stated to be spreading owing to the high prices and contraction of credit and private charity in Bankura District, Bengal Presidency. The number on relief was increasing in Bundelkhand Agency in Central India and in most of the districts of Central Provinces on completion of harvest operations. Distress was still acute in the affected tracts of Etawah and was increasing in Mirzapur districts of United Provinces. The water supply was failing in part of several districts of the Central Provinces and.deficient in most districts of Bombay and Madras.The number relieved was as follows : Bengal : test works, 6,255 ; gratuitous relief, 12,545. Bihar and Orissa : relief works, 3,554 ; test works, 40,213 ; gratuitous relief, 14,891. Feudatory &quot;States of Orissa : test works, 20,468 ; gratuitous relief, 15,599. United Provinces : test works, 17,732 ; gratuitous relief, 14,473. Rajputana Karauli State : relief works, 100 ; gratuitous relief, 2,300. Ajmer Merwara report not received. Central India, Bundelkhand : relief works, 14,600 ; gratuitous relief, 7,900. Central Provinces, last week figures: relief works, 11,928 ; test works, 25,412; gratuitous relief, 41,047. Bombay : relief works, 78,984 ; village works, 8,568 ; test works, 1,771; gratuitous relief, 90,924. Madras : relief works, 15,634 ; test works, 991 ; gratuitous relief, 63,463.OTHER COLONIES, PROTECTORATES, &amp;c.EGYPT.The Situation. No disturbances of any kind have been, reported during the week, though the economic strike at Port Said still continues.After an interregnum, which, with the exception of a few cla\7s in April when Rushdi Pasha returned to office, has lasted since December, a Ministry was formed on May 21st.   It is composed as follows :-Prime Minister and Minister of theInterior     - - - -   Mohamed Said Pasha.Minister of Public Works - -   Ismail Sirri Pasha.Alinister of Finance   - - -   Vusef Wahba Pasha.Minister of Education       - -   Ahmed Ziwar Pasha.Alinister of Agriculture        - -   Abd El Rahim Sabri Pasha.Minister of Justice - -   Ahmed Zulficar Pasha.Alinister of Pious Foundations (Wakfs)   Mohamed Tewfik Nessim Bey.Alohamed Pasha Said preceded Rushdy Pasha as Prime Minister. Sirri Pasha, &quot;Wahba Pasha and Ziwar Pasha were Ministers in the last Cabinet.So far there has not been much comment on the new Cabinet. General Allenby reports that it has received the approval of moderate opinion and that the Extremists are disappointed at such a strong Government having been brought together. It is hoped that normal conditions of administration will speedily return.News from the Sudan continues to be good. The mass of the poprdation is contented, and the leaders of educated opinion have all along been opposed to the agitation in Egypt. They realise that the success of the Nationalists would mean the increase of Egyptian a-t the expense of British influence in the Sudan, and they are very much averse to this. A delegation of Sudan notables will proceed to London early in July to congratulate the King on the conclusion of a victorious peace and to convey the expressions of their loyalty.
14RHODESIA.Future Government. The British Government have been informed that on May 20th the Legislative Council of Southern Rhodesia adopted a motion (by nine votes to seven) by Sir CCoghlan, Col. Grey voting in the minority with the administra-tion. The Resolution read as follows : &quot; That in view of the forthcoming General Elections for the Legislative Council of Southern Rhodesia and the issues which will arise thereat as to the desirability of terminating the administration of the British South Africa Company and replacing same by a form of Government more suited to meet the needs and requirements of the country, this Council resolves that in order to enable the country properly to consider and determine the said issues in the best interests of the country (a) His Majesty&apos;s Secretary of State for the Colonies be respectfully requested to state for public information what proof of fitness &apos; financially and in other respects &apos; will be considered sufficient to justify the grant to Southern Rhodesia of the form of administration commonly known as responsible Government as provided for under section 2 of His Majesty&apos;s Supplemental Charter, 1915; (b) His Excellency the High Commissioner be requested to convey this Resolution to His Majesty&apos;s Secretary of State for the Colonies with this councils humble request that the information asked for be given at an early date.&quot; .The Council divided on an amendment moved by the Attorney-General in favour of omitting in the preamble the words &quot;more&quot; to. &quot; country,&quot; and making the end of the sentence read &quot; another form of Government.&quot; The Attorney-General intimated that, if this amendment was made, the Administration would accept the motion.The following Resolution moved by Col. Grey was also adopted by 10 votes to 3, viz., &quot; That in the interests of this territory some means should be devised for providing money for capital expenditure from sources other than public revenue, and that His Majesty&apos;s Government be requested to allow the people of the territory to borrow reasonable sums of money on security of the public revenue for the purpose of carrying on the necessary public works.&quot;
