SECRET.APPRH !TATION Ok TMK ATTACH EL REPORT No. 9b.BRITISH  EMPIRE  AND AFRICA.Imperial Affairs.The decision temporarily, to suspend recruiting and the despatch of reinforce-ments will enable the Dominions to concentrate their efforts in other vital directions.Canada.The important speech of Sir W. Laurier outlining Liberal policy indicates that the veteran statesman intends to retain his leadership of the Opposition. The speech shows that a serious attempt will be made to bring back to the Liberal fold those who split off on the conscription issue ; that the Liberals maintain reciprocity with the United States as a plank in their platform ; and that Liberal policy does not favour a general scheme of Imperial Preference.The arrival of Mr. Dohertj^, the Minister of Justice, should do something to silence the Quebec criticism as to the non-representation of French Canada in peace discussions. - Mr. Doherty was one of the two Ministers, and one of the three Union Government supporters, who were elected to the Dominion House of Commons from Quebec Province. It will be recalled that the two Ministers who were actually French-Canadians were defeated at the General Election; though Colonel Bl on din subsequently secured a seat in the Senate.It is interesting to note that a list of Canadian, claims against the enemy, arising out of illegal methods of warfare, is being prepared.The Conference between Federal and Provincial authorities may result in an increase of Provincial powers in connection with land.Other items of interest in this Report relate to the return of soldiers to civil life, the British offer to purchase timber for reconstruction, the treatment of military defaulters, railway management, eve.Newfoundland.

BRITISH  EMPIRE   AND   AFRICA  REPORT.IMPERIAL AFFAIRS.Suspension of Reinforcements from the Dominions. The Dominion Governments have been informed that the Army Council consider that the military position justifies the temporary suspension of recruiting- and of the despatch of reinforcements. It is added, however, that it is not the intention to abandon the despatch of reinforcements from the United Kingdom which are necessary to maintain the oversea forces in France.Australasian Wool for Allies. The Governments of the Australian Commonwealth and Dominion of New Zealand have been informed that with regard to the wool allocated for Allied military purposes, the United States have not agreed to pay a higher price than that which is paid for British military wool. For diplomatic reasons and on account of the facilities given hy the United States in supplying other commodities to the British Empire, the British Government have agreed to the principle thus enunciated, and. in order to protect Australasian sheep farmers from loss it is proposed that a fixed bonus should be credited to the Dominion Governments on American and Italian military wool in place of the half share of anticipated profit. Instead, therefore, of the British Government obtaining profit on the wool, the proposed bonus will constitute an addition to the cost of the military wool taken by all the Allied Governments, so that the British Army and Navy votes will bear their share of the bonus.SELF-GOVERNING   DOMINIONS.CANADA.Minister of Justice. The Minister of Justice (Mr. C. J. Doherty) arrived in London on November 24th and joined his ministerial colleagues now over here (vide Report No. 95). It is understood Mr. Doherty will advise the Prime Minister on legal matters arising out of peace discussions.Liberal Policy : attitude towards Government. An important speech was delivered by the Leader of the Opposition (Sir Wilfrid Laurier) last week at London (Ont.) when he announced that a National Convention of the Liberal Party would be called in order to examine the problems resulting from the war and to endeavour to settle them &quot; on the lines of Liberal principles.&quot; According to published reports, Sir Wilfrid Laurier referred to the leadership of the Party and said that he had been urged some j^ears ago to abandon his position as leader, but that, being of Celtic race, he did not like to quit in times of clanger. Dealing with the split in the Liberal Party on the conscription issue, Sir Wilfrid said : &quot; We were all in favour o  the view that Canada should go into the conflict with the best she had in her of treasure and blood. From the very first we supported all the war measures of the Government, and we supported these measures until the day when it was announced that the voluntary system of recruiting would be given up in favour of a system of compulsory military service.&quot;The Opposition Leader then proceeded to criticise the Government for promising during the election to exempt&apos; the sons of farmers and breaking (as he alleged) that promise after the election.   Dealing with trade relations with the United States he
denounced those in Canada who had said that there should be no truck or trade with Yankees, and added - that if Americans were good enough &quot; to mix their blood with &apos; that of our Canadian boys in France,&quot; never again should such talk be heard in Canada.On the. point of the responsibility of the. German people for the atrocities., committed, Sir W. Laurier said he could not agree that the German people could be held responsible for the atrocities committed by their armies. That responsibility rested on the commanders of the German armies. Were we, he asked, to believe that the German people, one of the noblest races in the world in the past, could not reclaim themselves, as so many other nations had been reclaimed, through the teaching of democracy &apos;?As to Great Britaihs part in the war, the Liberal Leader said that, to her eternal honour, the war found Great Britain unprepared, and agreed with M. Clemenceau that but for the support given to France by Britain the former would have been crushed and dismembered. He then paid a sincere tribute to King George, and asked the audience to rise and give three cheers for the King, and himsejf led the cheering.Dealing with the matter of Imperial Preference, Sir Wilfrid denounced those who &quot; to-day are conspiring to force Britain to abandon Free Trade for Protection for the benefit of the overseas Dominions.&quot; The Canadian Parliament had not consented to any principle of Imperial Preference, so far as the Liberal Party was concerned. &quot; We will never ask to go back upon our policy of preference, nor shall we ask England to give up some petty or big favour for it. We do not desire in Canada to tax&quot; the food of the working people of Great Britain. By serving the interests of Canada we shall serve those of Great Britain and the Empire. If the British Empire is to continue it will not be by reconstructing any law of freedom, but by extending it all over the world ; and this policy we. hope will be adopted.&quot;Regarding the visit of Sir Robert borden and his ministerial colleagues to England, Sir Wilfrid Laurier criticised what he termed the hasty departure of Canadian Ministers for the Peace Conference, and suggested that it .would have been the part of prudence and patriotism for the Prime Minister to have first called Parliament together to hear the views of the Canadian people, so far as these views could be expressed by the present Parliament.As to demobilisation and reconstruction, the Liberal Leader declared that the Government had neglected, to prepare for the return of the soldiers and had done nothing towards reconstruction, and urged that suitable employment for soldiers, with adequate pensions, must be provided, and the relations of capital and labour iniproved.Mr. W. S. Fielding, the veteran Liberal,, who was Finance Minister under Sir W. Laurier, and who supported the Union Government in their conscription policy (vide Report No. 40), has contributed a letter to the Halifax Chronicle on the future of Liberalism, in which he makes an appeal for a united Liberal Party. As to the continuance of the present Government in office, Mr. Fielding states his belief that it will be better from every point of view that the Union Government be permitted to cany on the w*ar effort of Canada, and continues : &quot; In this work they should have the co-operation of the Opposition, coupled, of course, with legitimate criticism. When the war and its immediate business is over, new situations will arise. Then, I think, that Liberals may reasonably ask for a new deal, and in the event of a united party, the probabilities are that a Liberal Government could be placed in power.&quot;Representation of ^French Canada in Peace Discussions. Senator L. 0. David, of Montreal, who represents Mi He lies in the Dominion Upper House, has contributed a signed article to the Press in which he refers to the representation of French Canada in peace discussions. - He says : &quot;Unfortunately we are not. to be represented in London and cannot therefore discuss with the Imperial authorities grave questions concerning the Empire at large. Why is there not one French Canadian on the Delegation, and why was not Sir Wilfrid Laurier called upon to accompany them in order that they might have the benefit of his long experience ? Have not French Canadians done enough and shed blood enough to merit one of their own people being heard among the representatives of the Empire? &quot;The French Canadian paper La Vatrie, of Montreal, says that Quebec Province &quot;has the right to know why M. Blondin was not called upon to form part of the Canadian Mission, and if this was impossible, .could not Sir Wilfrid Laurier or&quot;Sir Homer Gouin have done honour to the French Canadian name ? &quot;
Claims for Indemnities. -The -Government have directed the preparation of a list of claims by Canadians against the Central Powers arising out of the illegal methods of warfare practised by the enemy during the war. The claims arise chiefly-through the torpedoing of ships and relate to loss of life as well as to loss of proper^. A further list will also be made out, covering claims for damages following breaches of contracts, with neutrals owing to the action of the enemy.Timber for Reconstruction. The Dominion Government have been informed that it is expected that there will be considerable shortage in the timber supply in European producing countries, and that the British Government have under consideration the matter of placing orders in Canada for about one million standards for delivery during the next two years, one half of the amount being dealt with in the first year after peace. It is pointed out, however, that the arrangement cannot be sanctioned unless the Dominion Government can provide the funds necessary to meet possibie adverse exchange conditions. The estimated cost of the timber purchase would be 15,000,000L, spread over the two years, and the British Treasury would not draw upon the credit unless the exchanges were adverse to the United Kingdom when the payments became clue. It is pointed out that the proposed order is of great importance in relation to building programmes and other social purposes arising out of after-war problems in the Unitad Kingdom, and the hope of the British Government is expressed that the Dominion Government can give the contingent guarantee.In reply the Dominion Government state their willingness to find credit for the purchase of timber in Canada, up to an amount of about $50,000,000, extending over the next two years, subject to the condition mentioned as to drawing upon the credit. The Dominion Government consider [it essential that the purchases should be made throush the Commission which is about to be established in Canada on similar lines to the Imperial Munitions Board.Committee on Repatriation. A Committee of the Cabinet has been formed to co-ordinate the efforts of the various departments which are giving close attention to the problems of reconstruction arising out of the conclusion of the war.The Committee is composed of Sir James Lougheed, Mr. N. W. Powell, Mr. T. A. Crerar, Senator Gideon Robertson, Mr. Arthur Meighen and Mr. J. A. Calder. It will be known as the Repatriation Committee, and, while it will not be charged with the responsibility of demobilisation, which is the function of the Department of Militia, questions relating to the return of the soldiers to Canada will be given the fullest consideration in working out the problems of reconstruction.Soldiers returning during November. The Militia Department has announced that 10,000 soldiers of the Overseas Military Forces will sail for the Dominion before the end of November. The men, who are mostly those in a low category, are being returned during the armistice period in order&apos;* to assist in clearing the way for the movement of the main Canadian army when it is not required any longer in Europe.Conference with Provincial Premiers. A Conference between the Dominion Government and the Provincial Premiers connected with the re-establishment of soldiers in civilian life and other important matters was.opened at Ottawa last week. The initial discussion at the Conference centred round the transfer of the natural resources of the Prairie Provinces from Federal to Provincial control. One of the -subjects vmich will be discussed at an early date is that of land settlement.The Premier of Alberta announced before the Conference met that his Province intends to ask at the Conference for the control of the whole of its land. The Premier of New Brunswick stated that his Province&apos; would not offer any objection, but would ask to be compensated as a partner in the Dominion.Soldiers and the Land. According to the National Service cards filled in by members of the Canadian Forces in the spring of 1917 (vide Report No. 93), over 105,000 soldiers have expressed a definite Avish to take up farming on their return to Canada. The number of cards signed totalled 230,000, indicating that nearly 44 per cent, of the men desire to settle on the land. Of the 105,000 who wish to go on the land, 74 per cent, stated that they have had previous agricultural experience, 58 per cent, have had three or more years&apos; training, while nearly 11 per cent, have had 20 years or over. Of the 124,000 members of the Overseas Military Forces who do-not wish to follow agriculture, over 50,000 say that the positions they held before enlistment are open to them on their return 1
Treatment of Defaulters: suggested Disfranchisement. An official statement -which has just been issued indicates that the Government clo not intend to permit those defaulters who refused to come to the help of their country in the hour of her greatest need to escape ^punishment. The statement goes on to say : &quot; The whole question of how the defaulters are to be dealt with is now engaging the serious attention of the Government in connection with their other plans for demobilisation. Various alternatives have been suggested as to how these -men should be dealt with, and one of them is that they should be disfranchised for a definite period.&quot;Federal Employment Offices. A national system of employment offices is to be established in the Dominion, co-ordinated through the Department of Labour, and the Minister of Labour proposes to undertake the work of organisation immediately. At a series of conferences held during the last week, questions of policy, plans for organising the system, and details of office routine were discussed, and a general scheme was decided upon. The system will have as a basis the employment work which has already been done in Ontario and Quebec, as well as the agricultural employment system adopted in the Western Provinces. The relation of the Employ-ment Organisation to the work of the Department of Soldiers Civil Re-establishment has been practically agreed upon.The Government Railways. An Order-in-Council has been passed transferring the management and operation of the Canadian Government railways, which comprise the Intercolonial and its branch lines and the National Transcontinental, to the Board of Directors appointed to manage the Canadian Northern system. This transfer will place all the railways owned by the people of Canada under this Board.Victory Loan. Though the maximum which the people of the Dominion were asked to subscribe to the Victory Loan Avas fixed at $500,000,000, the results show that the total subscribed amounted to over $676,000,000.NE WEOUNDLAN D.Prime Minister. The Prime Minister (Mr. W. E. Lloyd) is now&apos; expected to. arrive in London on November 28th.AUSTRALIAN COMMON WEALTH.President Wilson s Peace Terms : Cabinet&apos;s Action. The Acting Prime Minister (Mr. Watt), replying to Mr. Higgs in the House of Representatives, said the Common-wealth Government, on October 15th, before the Armistice was arranged, cabled to Mr. Hughes drawing his attention to points two, three and five of President WilsoiVs terms, and suggesting he should carefully consider their bearing on Australian interests.Peace Terms: Question of Indemnity and Pacific Islands. The Premier of New Scuth Wales (Mr. W. A. Holman) in a speech delivered about TO days ago said that if a scheme can be devised whereby Australia is assured that there will be no more war it becomes an entirely secondary and unimportant consideration whether she gets any indemnity. The best commercial treaty, he said, would be worth nothing under the liability of another war.In the New South Wales Legislative Council Mr. Black said that if the German Colonies were returned to Germany the slender threads of kinship would be severely strained, if not wholly snapped. Mr. Meagher gave notice of motion that the Legislative Council, recognising the serious menace to Australia in the attempted world domination by Germany, hereby affirms that the restoration of German: possessions in the Pacific, especially in New- Guinea, would imperil future generations by giving vantage posts to a treacherous and unscrupulous foe, and that the peaceful development and destiny of xDeoples whose shores are washed by the Pacific would be best consummated by such possessions being placed under either British domination or International control.The House of Assembly of Western Australia has passed a motion similar to that of the Commonwealth Parliament (vide Report No. 95) declaring against the restora-tion of Germany&apos;s Pacific Island possessions, and urging that Australia be consulted regarding their future control.6817-40 B
The House of Assembly of South Australia has passed the following motion:  &quot; That in the opinion of this House the Dominions must be permitted the fullest constitutional freedom to solve their own economic problems and to secure the same. Australia should be directly represented at the Conference called to settle the terms of peace.&quot;The Council of the Melbourne Chamber of Commerce has passed the following-resolution : &quot; This Council &quot;is of opinion that in the settlement of tei-ms of peace, the ends of justice demand restitution, reparation, and compensation.&quot;The &quot;Newcastle (N.S.W.) Chamber of Commerce has expressed the opinion that the peace terms should include the reparation to which Australia was justly entitled, and further that the former German Colonies in the Pacific should not, in the interests of Australia and of peaceful conditions for the great ocean highway, be handed back to Germany.The Australian Executive of the United Commercial Travellers Association has unanimously adopted a resolution as follows : &quot; While rejoicing at the prospect of an early declaration of peace, this Association extends its hearty support to the Australian Prime Minister in his contention that Germany, in addition to making-reparation for property destroyed, should be compelled to pay a general indemnity covering at least a substantial portion of the Allied war expenditure, and that the German Colonies should not in any circumstances be returned.The Sydney Morning Herald; referring to the Pacific Islands cpiestion, said : &quot; It is not for the sake of any exclusive rights that Australians desire the retention of the islauds, but for their own protection, and for the fulfilment of the trust which they have undertaken towards the white and coloured races.&quot;The Bendigo Advertiser, on the same subject, said : &quot; It is difficult to understand how any representative Australian can be found so indifferent regarding the welfare and safety of the Commonwealth in clays to come as to refuse to accord support to a proposal which aims at the final removal from these waters of what everybody must know now to have been a deadly menace to Australia&apos;s peace and security.&quot;The Melbourne Argus said: &quot; The notorious fact is that Germany took possession of her Colonies for strategical reasons, not for the purposes of development. All her colonisation work has been clone in recent years. It was developed along with and as part of her plan to dominate Europe, and displace Great Britain from her mastery over the seas. Her first task in the Pacific was to create important naval bases, and she erected in the Cameroons, West Africa, and at Rahaul, New Guinea, what will probably be the most powerful installations of wire-less telegraphy in the world.&quot; The Argus also said : &quot; To the people of the Common-wealth the final exprdsion of Germany from&apos; the Pacific Islands is a. matter of vital importance.&quot;The Melbourne Herald said: &quot;There can be no peaceful future for Australia or New Zealand if the enemy is once more installed within a few hours or even a few days&apos; sail of their coasts.&quot;Preferential Voting. An electoral Bill establishing preferential voting for the House of Representatives, and restoring postal voting has been passed by both Houses of the Commonwealth Parliament after strenuous opposition from the Labour Party, which sought to delay the measure and thus prevent preferential voting operating at the bve-election for the Corano-amite seat. The Labour Partv hoped to capture this seat on a split vote, similarly to that won at the recent Swan bye-election. The Bill was forced through the House of Representatives by the guillotine after an all night sitting. In the Senate the Labour Leader, Senator Gardiner, made the record speech for Australia of II hours and 45 minutes, speaking all night. In the final stages of the Bill a ministerial amendment was made extending the Franchise to include members of the Australian Imperial Forces between 18 and 21 years of age. This amendment affects about 130,000 voters.Extension of War Precautions Act. The Federal Ministry has introduced a Bill to extend the War Precautions Act for six months after the war.Disposal of Commonwealth Wheat. The Acting Prime Minister has cabled to Mr. Hughes the following resolution of the Australian Wheat Board :: &quot; In view of the fact that another wheat harvest is due, which will require at least 10,000,000Z. for payments to growers of Australian wheat, the Board thinks it desirable that you
should endeavour to sell 1,000,000 tons of wheat to the best advantage, being the balance of the 1916-17 and a portion of the 1917-18 wheat, with a minimum price of 4s. 9d. per bushel ; that the above be on condition that Australia is permitted to compete in the world&apos;s wheat markets, subject only to such war conditions as may be in operation. The Board further thinks that the whole of the Eastern and South African markets should be reserved to the Australian Wheat Board, for the disposal of the balance of the wheat. The Board is strongly o  opinion that you should do your best to preserve our interests in Norway and Sweden.&quot;Enlistments, and Casualties.&apos; -Replying to a question in the Senate, the Minister for Defence, Senator Pearce, stated that Australian enlistments to October 31st, 1918, totalled 415,685, comprising, New South Wales 163,528, Victoria 112,207, Queensland 57,542, South Australia 34,854, West Australia 32,165, Tasmania 15,389. Dealing with casualties (vide Report No. 93), the Minister stated the deaths numbered 55,554, while other casualties, missing, &amp;c. (including re-admissions to hospitals), were 256,576.   He said 79,984 men had returned to Australia.Commonwealth Lead Supplies. In the course of a Report to the War Cabinet by the Australian Purchases Committee dated November 6th, 19 IS, it is pointed out that of the lead supplies of the world no less than 17*01 per cent, is supplied by Australia, the percentage supplied by the whole British Empire being 20&apos;37, by Allied countries 45 &quot;23, by neutral countries 19 * 26, and by enemy countries 15&apos; 14. The Board of Trade Non-Ferrous Metals Committee, which with the similar Committee of the Ministry of Reconstruction and Mr. W. Long&apos;s Committee reported in favour of a purchase by the British Government of the surplus output of Australian lead, is quoted in the above-mentioned Report as stating on February 13th, 1918, that &quot; In lead a world shortage has to be faced, but the position of the lead industry in this country may be practically assured by definitely securing the surplus Australian supply.&quot;Wool for the Allies. Arrangements proposed by the British Government regarding wool for Allied military purposes will be found under &apos;; Imperial Affairs.&quot;NEW ZEALAND.Prime Minister and Indemnities. The Prime Minister of the Dominion (Mr. Massey) has made a public statement to the Press upon the question of indemnities, in which he is reported to have said: &quot;With regard to the question of indemnities,-! do not know what Germany is financially capable of, but so long as Germany is able to pay for injuries inflicted, Germany ought to be compelled to pay. Anything less would be unjust to those who have been injured and to those left behind.&quot;Wool for Allied Purposes. Arrangements proposed by the British Government regarding Australasian wool for Allied military purposes will be found under &quot;Imperial Affairs.&quot;SOUTH AFRICA.Ministerial Party coming to England.  The Prime Minister (General Botha) who is now on his way to England with Mrs. Botha, is accompanied by Sir David de Villiers Graaff (Minister without Portfolio) and Lady Graaff. Sir William Hoy, the General Manager of the Union Railways and Harbours, is also in the party, accompanied by Lady Hoy.Mr. Burton and Imperial War Cabinet Development. The Union Minister of Railways and Harbours (Mr. Henry Burton) made his first speech after his return to South Africa on November 14th. In this he referred to the work of the Imperial War Cabinet, and he declared that he did not know of a single step taken that could be construed, by even the wildest effort at misrepresentation, as being injurious to South Africa. &quot; The Dominions representatives,&quot; Mr. Burton continued, &quot; sat in the. War Cabinet on a footing of absolute equality with the British, and there is a sincere and deep-seated desire to see that a status of actual working reality shad be established.&quot; The idea of a Parliamentary Federation had been abandoned, ire  said, as being too complicated, but Mr.  Burton   approvingly  described  the
scheme recently adopted of creating closer and permanent contact between the Dominions and the British Cabinet. He considered that this was the best and most practical solution for securing a voice in Imperial affairs without hampering the operations of the peoples of the various Dominions. The new departure, he said, by which Prime Ministers of &quot;the Dominions would have, &quot; as a right,&quot; liberty to communicate direct with the British Prime Minister, while each Dominion could have a Minister permanently resident in London with the right of entry to the British Cabinet for the discussion of all Commonwealth concerns, would ensure that constant touch which would enable the Dominions in future to have a voice in shaping a foreign policy for the consequences of which they are in practice, inevitably liable. Mr. Burton then gave an emphatic denial to assertions or insinuations that, in general, South African interests had been compromised by the South African delegation behind the back of the Union Parliament. &quot; A matter on which the Dominions had been fully consulted,&quot; the speaker continued, &quot; and on which they will be consulted to the very end, is the matter of peace terms. There has been the fullest consultation with the Dominions representatives, and nothing could be more unfortunate than the creation of an impression that this vital principle has been departed from. I am perfectly certain that it has not been departed from by one jot or one tittle.&quot;Interned Enemy Civilians. In reply to the enquiry of the Union Government as to the policy of the British Government regarding interned enemy civilians (vide Report No. 95), the Union Government have been informed that the policy is substantially in accordance with the Report of the Aliens Committee. The British Government state that they see no objection to the proposed relaxation in South Africa. The question of whether a distinction should be made between Germans and Austro-Hungarians is one to be determined by local considerations. It is added that repatriation under the Hague agreement recently concluded is over-ruled by the terms of the armistice.Mining Industry : After War D ifficidties. Sir E. H. Wallers, President of the Chamber of Mines, in a speech which he delivered at Johannesburg on November 16th, juedicted a difficult industrial aftermath to the war as far as the mining industry Avas concerned. It would be a long time, he said, before they would be able to adjust themselves to more normal conditions. The views of extremists on both sides required to be submerged in the considered ox3inion of all parties. The Secretary of the Miners&apos; Union said that he hoped the workers would one day take over the industry, but that there was no objection whatever to Sir E. Wallers retaining his position at their head.INDIA.(Excluding External Affairs, ichich are decdt with in the Eastern Report.)War Cabinet Telegram of Congratulation. The telegram from the War Cabinet offering cordial congratulations to the Government of India and to the Princes and people of the country at the close of the victorious operations against the armies of the Ottoman Empire, in which it was observed that in every theatre Indian troops had enhanced the fame of the Indian Army, that the martial races of India had been supported by the cheerful endurance and devotion of Indian labour behind the lines, that the economic resources of the country had been successfully organised by the Munitions Board of India, and that capital had been freely forthcoming, was published in India upon its receipt, together with one associating the Council of India and the Secretary of State with the message, and the Viceroy has informed the Secretary of State that intense gratification has been caused in India. The Viceroy has conveyed deep appreciation of the terms in which the message was couched.Internal Situation. The Viceroy informed the Secretary of State for India on November 18th that the agricultural situation was bad, and that bazaar looting had
been reported from Bengal, Beliar and the United (Provinces. It was stated that ^   influenza was abating.Home Tiulers and Labour Unions. The Viceroy has informed the Secretary of State that home Rulers in Madras are endeavouring to organise labour Unions which may give rise to trouble.Reforms Committees. The Committees dealing with Reforms held&quot; preliminary meetings at Simla, and then proceeded to Delhi and Patna; It is stated in the Press that they expect to conclude their investigations in February.Communal Electorates. The South Indian Non-Brahmin Confederation have sent a telegram to Lord Sydenham, dated November 19th, in which it is stated that the Confederation, &quot; in an extraordinary session held at Madras on October 20th, delegates from all parts of the Presidency attending, unanimously passed a resolution recording unswerving loyalty to the British Crown, and rejoicing in Allied successes ; emphasising also that any Reforms without communal electorates will arrest progress, injure the interests of a large population, and undermine British rule ; and declining an opinion upon the Reforms till communal electorates are guaranteed ; emphatically protesting against the constitution of the Franchise Committee, consisting of Brahmin Congressmen inimical to non-Brahmin aspirations, opponents of communal electorates, who are posing (as possessing ?) a special knowledge of social conditions, and being-likely without non-Brahmins to prejudice the Committee against, the non-Brahmin classes ; expressing indignation and dismay at the indifference towards numerous influential protests against the deliberate inclusion in the Franchise Committee of men excepted supporting the Viceroy&apos;s and Secretary of State&apos;s opposition to non-Brahmin communal electorates, and excluding non-Brahmin leaders.&quot;The telegram continues ; &quot; The nomination of Mr. Sastri is an open encourage-ment to an agitation whose idtimate object is the re-establishment of the political Brahmin supremacy so detrimental to the continuance of the British Imperial connection and the advancement of the non-Brahmin communities, whose interests are identical with the maintenance of the British character of the administration. We solemnly resolve that we decline to appear before, or co-operate with, the Reforms Committees unless non-Brahmin representatives are appointed on each committee ; and record the deejo gratitude of the non-Brahmin communities to Dr. Nair, their accredited representative and leader, for his self-sacrificing labours on their behalf.&quot;Enemy Missions in Madras. The quinquennial Report on Education has been published in India and according to extracts given in the Press the Report dwells on the extensive part played by enemy missions in India before the war. In the Madras Presidency alone there were one college and 477 schools with 31,000 pupils wholly or partly under German management, while measures were taken to continue these educational activities by other agencies. &apos;Indian Revolutionaries at Moscow. Russian Wireless of&quot; November 16th reports that the delegates of the Indian National Mussulman League, after having been nine months on the journey, have arrived at Moscow, bringing a letter containing an appeal to Soviet Russia which is as follows : &quot; Leaders of the Russian Revolution ! India congratulates you on the great victory won by you in the&quot; interests of the peoples of the whole world. India admires the humanitarian ideal which you set forth when you took poaver in your hands. The Indian people prays ProAodence to strengthen and to harden you in this ideal, but at the same time the Indian people entertain fears for the duration of your poaver, because as long as England keeps in servitude 350 millions of Indian people your universal aims cannot be realised. In the name of the success of your noble task, we warn you not to resume friendship with England. You have to choose betaveen the tavo, taking in anew that it is impossible to keep one&apos;s own house clean, while you have an unclean neighbour, and that England will never tolerate, at the side of the Colonies enslaved by her, a Republic based on your principles. You may be sure that England will stop at nothing in order to strangle your young Socialist Republic, and if you want to obtain any success you must refrain from making any compromise, regardless of the number of years that may be required for the achievement of your aims. The independence of the Indian people must be an integral and the most important part of your rjrograrnme,6S17-4a - .        C
however difficult this may appear. The existence of no People&apos;s Government in any part of the world is possible without the liberation of the Indian people, as such a liberation would mean the destruction of British Imperialism. You know yourselves which policy is the best for the welfare of Russia. With cordial salutations. The Indian People.Contribution of Men and Casualties incurred.

Attention is called in this Memorandum to a Board of Trade paper (G.T. 3313), which was circulated on January 11th, 1918, regarding a scheme of international control for Equatorial Africa, in the course of avhich it avas stated that an international status had already existed in germ in the regime set up by the Berlin and Brussels Acts. As to the Berlin Conference, the Memorandum points out this AAras the outcome of the scramble among the Great European poavers for A*frica, and its chief purpose was to arrive at an understanding with reference to the Congo Basin. After referring to the system of concessions introduced by King Leopold (entirely contrary to the spirit of the Berlin Act), and to other facts showing that as regards the administration of the Congo and freedom of trade, inter-nationalism proved a failure, the memorandum states that the Berlin Act furnishes but cold comfort to the internationalists and that the experience of the working of tire Brussels Act has hardly been more encouraging. After referring to the results of the conferences  AAdrich  attempted  to   deal avith  the West Africa  liquor trade, the
memorandum states that although nearly 30 years have elapsed since the main conference met at Brussels, the Powers, acting together, have on by advanced half way towards the minimum duty which Great Britain suggested at the outset; but that since 1906, acting independently, and with no assistance from any conference, the Powers principally concerned have increased their duties to amounts far in excess of what they failed to agree upon. It is then shown that in the case of the arms traffic the results of international action have been even more unedifying.After dealing with the Declaration of July 2nd, 1890, fixing a maximum duty of 10 per cent, ad valorem for imports into the Conventional Basin, the memorandum states that the Colonial Office would see without regret the disappearance of the Berlin Act and the declaration of July 2nd, 1890; and with regard to the small remnant of the Brussels Act which is still operative, the strong opinion is expressed that the time has come when it should be laid down as a guiding principle for future action that the only Powers reasonably entitled to a voice in the arrangements for the welfare of African natives are those which have territories in the African continent.It is suggested in the memorandum that even if it were desirable to institute a system of free trade and ecpial Customs duties throughout the whole of Tropical Africa, it is quite unnecessary to set on foot a new and cumbrous international organisation for the purpose. As to the proposed establishment of a single Customs&apos; tariff for the whole of Tropical Africa, the memorandum submits that, having regard to the varying conditions of development, race, &amp;c, throughout, the vast area, any scheme of the kind must appear to those who have had practical experience of the administration of these territories to be quite unworkable; while the establishment of an &quot; equalisation fund&quot; under an International Customs Board is described as chimerical. The experiences of the International Commission established in 1876 for the Egyptian Caisse de la Dette are referred to, and it is commented that it may be well wondered what the result would be of throwing the Customs&apos; revenue of Tropical Africa, with its numerous administrations, its vast territories in varying stages of development, and all its racial economic and other differences, into the &quot; dead hand &quot;of an International Customs Board consisting of the representatives of some tAvelve Powers. Factions, it is pointed out, would be formed among the different Powers, intrigue would be rampant, and even if Germany were excluded, she might still be able to use some friendly Power to further her designs.In conclusion, the Memorandum states that internationalism in a mild form, and assisted by humanitarian considerations has proved, on the whole, a dismal failure in Tropical Africa, and neither past experience nor the logic of things gives any ground for anticipating better results from a more developed form of this regime.GERMAN COLONIES.Popular Feeling in Germany. A memorandum on German Colonies and popular feeling in Germany has been circulated by the Political Intelligence Department of the Foreign Office, in the course of which it is pointed out that it would seem that among the great mass of the German middle class the interest in the Colonies faded during the war, but that a certain sentimental attachment to the idea of a Colonial Empire still remained. In the early days of Germany&apos;s Colonial activities the Social Democrats took up a hostile attitude, but when later on the German Empire seemed to have an Oversea Empire in the tropics firndy attached to it and attempts were made to make German methods more consonant with humanity, it became more difficult for the German Social Democrat to keep up- a purely negative attitude to the Colonial question.As an example of the more recent attitude, an extract is given from an article by Dr. Adolf Koster in Die Glocke, the Social Democrat weekly of September 21st, 1918, in which it is stated : &quot; The German working class would willingly abandon Lithuania to the Russians if we could gain a secure position in Africa by the peace. The fact that the restoration of our economic position in the world is far more important than any war-aims on the European Continent this, through all the course of the Avar, w^e have neA^er grown weary of reiterating. . . . And to-day, Avhen America&apos;s effective entry into the war has sobered the intoxicated of yesterday, Colonies have once again become the common AArar aim of the whole German jieople.&quot;
. , It is stated in the Memorandum that the attitude of the bulk of the Socialist Party seems to have wavered between the old suspicion of Colonial Imperialism and the championship of a Colonial policy characteristic of the Right Wing. In 1917 in the Stockholm Memorandum of the German Majority Socialists it was explained expressly that &quot; the rejection of forced annexations clearly implies the restoration of colonies which have been taken.&quot; It is observed, however, that the Minority Social Democrats have adhered to their old policy of opposition and continue to maintain that the desire to have oversea Colonies is reprehensible Imperialism. In the Minority Memorandum issued at Stockholm in 1917 they affirmed that Germany could not ask to have her Colonies back on any ground of justice.The Memorandum points out that the demand for colonies which has grown weaker in bourgeois circles has grown stronger in Labour circles ; the Social Democrats do not justify the demand, however, on the ground of German world-power, but on the material needs of the working class. In short, the fear of German. Labour regarding the loss of the colonies is stated to be based upon the belief that it would involve economic miseiy at home. If the new arrangement of the world be so devised that the fear is removed, it seems questionable, the Memorandum states, whether the German working class will continue to feel any strong interest in the possession of oversea dominions.
