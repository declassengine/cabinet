SECRET.APPRECIATION OK THE ATTACHED REPORT No. 123.BRITISH  EMPIRE  AND AFRICA.Canada.From a political standpoint the Finance Ministers statement regarding tariff policy is of the first importance. The concessions to the Western low-tariff attitude and the announcement that a tariff enquiry will be held in the autumn will probably maintain for the Government the support of the general body of Western Liberal Unionists, though no doubt several will vote against the Government on the Budget, The resignation of Mr. Crerar and the declaration of Mr. Carvell, however, illustrate the difficulties of the position.The intention of the Government to take a larger proportion from individual incomes to assist in meeting the nation&apos;s obligations is*one of the outstanding features of the Budget.The Labour troubles are not yet at an end, and there is now no room for doubt as to the Bolshevist character of the disturbances.Australian Commonwealth.The visit of Lord Jellicoe is serving to stimulate thought upon the naval policy of the future. The statement of Mr. Watt as to the position of the Commonwealth in relation to the naval defence of the Empire will be read with interest.The extremist section has not apparently succeeded in capturing the Labour Party Conference.South Africa.A summary of the main points of the reply to the Nationalist Deputation is given in this Report,British Indians in the Transvaal are continuing to protest against the Bill dealing with Indian trading rights and ownership of land. The Bill has received some amendment in the Senate.India.The attitude of the Ruling Princes and chiefs towards the Afghan menace has been particularly gratifying.Other Colonies, Protectorates, &amp;c.There is nothing special to report as to the situation in Egypt, The Resolution of the Southern Rhodesian Legislative Council regarding mineral rights should be noted.H. d&apos;E.June 13th? 1919.

BRITISH  EMPIRE   AND   AFRICA   REPORT.SELF-GOVERNING   DOMINIONS.CANADA.Budget Proposals. The Budget proposals introduced into the House of Conrrnons by the Minister of Finance (Sir Thomas White) indicate the intention to grant to Great Britain a larger preference than has heretofore been given in the markets of the Dominion.Other features are a reduction of the duties on agricultural implements of from 27 to 15 per cent., and a reduction of railway rates on agricultural implements.A number of other important changes include the free importation of wheat flour and potatoes, and a heavy increase of income taxation. The Business Profits War Tax was renewed for the current calendar year, but a partial revision makes it no longer applicable to foodstuffs of various kinds, clothing, leather goods, agricultural implements, petroleum, oils and bituminous coal.It is proposed to increase income taxation to make up an estimated loss hy tariff reductions of probably $17,000,000 and other anticipated losses to Customs revenue.A normal rate of 4&apos;per cent, will apply to all incomes exceeding $1,000 up to $6,000 in the case of unmarried persons, and on incomes from $2,000. to $6,000 in the case of married persons.The surtax will commence at $5,000 instead of $6,000, and will gradually increase to 65 per cent, where the net income exceeds SI ,000,000. A normal tax of 8 per cent, is imposed on incomes exceeding $6,000.The Business Profits War Tax calls for a 25 per cent, tax on profits in excess of 10 per cent., and by businesses having capital from $25,000 to $50,000. The tax on businesses having capital over $50,000 is graduated to 75 per cent, on profits exceeding 20 per cent.Exemption is granted to incorporated companies up to a profit of 7 per cent., and for other than incorporated companies up to 10 per cent.The Budget disclosed Canad.a&apos;s financial condition as follows : Pre-war national debt, $325,996,850; estimated debt at the completion of demobilisation $1,950,000,000.It was estimated that the total expenditure for the current pear would be $620,000,000, and the revenue $280,000,000, leaving a deficit to be covered bv loans of $340,000,000.Ministerial Differences on the Budget. The Minister of Agriculture (Mr. T. A. Crerar) has resigned from the Dominion Cabinet, and the Minister of Immigration and Colonisation (Mr. J. A. Calder) has been appointed temporarily as his successor.In explaining his position Mr. Crerar stated that his resignation was clue to his inability to support the Budget. He disagreed with the proposal to continue a protective policy which raised immediate revenue largely by customs and excise taxation. The Western Provinces were thereby, he considered, discriminated against. Mr. Crerar generally advocated free trade and reciprocity with the United States.The Minister of Public Works (Mr. F. B. Carved) has outlined bis position regarding the Budget, stating that he will support it, though he is of the opinion that it does not represent what the settled fiscal policy of the country should be, and he reserves the right to say so.Labour Troubles. The Minister of Immigration and Colonisation reported on June 3rd that through sympathetic strikes last week in the cities west of Winnipeg and in Toronto the strike situation became much more serious ; during the last few days the position had become easier and the Government was hopeful regarding the outlook.
Since the above statement was issued, the: report of the Secret Service investi-gations on the origin of the strike have been published. These show that the strikes1 at Winnipeg originated at-the Calgary Convention in March,&apos;directed by the I.W.W. of the United States, at which resolutions were passed greeting the Russian Soviet ^ Provernment and the German ,Spartacists and asking all the unions of Canada to drop international affiliations and craft organisations and join the &quot;One Big Union&quot; movement.It- was reported on &apos; June 12th that 40. per cent, of those involved in the Winnipeg strikes had returned to work, and that the strike was broken so far as danger to the safety of the general public was concerned. Some street fighting, however, has occurred resulting in injuries to special constables (including Corporal Coppins, V.C.), and others. It was reported that returned soldiers were divided over the question of the general strike, and separate demonstrations were held by those in favour of and against the strike. .&apos;&apos;In the House of Commons last week the Minister of the Interior (Mr. Meighen) dealt with the Winnipeg strikes on his return from that city. Mr. Meighen said that the general strike took place after an assertion that it would take place whether collective bargaining was acknowledged &apos; or otherwise. In order to render the movement successful, the strike leaders removed a great many necessaries of life from the people, and attempted to usurp the Government&apos;^ authority. Moves of this nature aroused the citizens, who, when they were organised, caused a rapid retreat on the part of the strikers. Declaring that Winnipeg citizens had done a good service, not only for their own city but for the whole of Carrada, the Minister stated that if further evidence that Soviet Government was attempted were necessary, oneneed but consider the Labfjur press of the city ancl read statements emanating from the strike-leaders, who declared that they were exercising Governmental authority. Before any. other issues were considered, Mr. Meighen, in conjunction with Senator Robertson, found it necessary to destroy all attempts at the usurpation of constitutional rights.A general strike in sjunpathy with the Winnipeg strike commenced in Vancouver last week. Certain exemptions from the strike were made in the case of firemen, policemen, &amp;c, and it was reported that the strikers included only seamen employed in the coastal trade of British Colombia, the workers in five shipyards, the Union of Longshoremen and the employees of the Northern Iron Works.In Toronto, the President of the Metal Trades Council issued a notice advising the men who struck in sympathy with the metal trade workers to return to work. The general strike in Toronto is stated to have collapsed.Parliamentary Session.: It is now considered probable that the Parliamentary Session will end about the last week in June ancl that another Session will be held in the autumn.Cost of Living. The Parliamentary Committee chosen for the purpose of enquiring into the high cost of living has commenced its daily meetings.Mr. G. B. Nicholson (U., Algonia E.), who was elected chairman, stated that in order to settle the unrest caused by the cost of living, it would be necessary to reach the causes of the present high prices and to inform the population of the Dominion what these reasons were. He also said that the inquiry would be wide though It would confine itself to definite lines.Demobilisation. Demobilisation is proceeding smoothly. In May 41,000 returned soldiers arrived and 55,000 are expected in June. Large numbers are taking up land (chiefly in the Western Provinces) through the Soldiers&apos; Settlement Board Scheme.AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH.Naval Policy and the League of Nations. At the -Navy League dinner to Lord Jellicoe, the Acting Prime Minister (Mr. Watt), referring to the League of Nations, said that everyone trusted that the compact would end war, ancl would lead eventually to disarmament. &quot;I will say,&quot; he said, &quot;with a full sense of responsibility for the Government, that in this particular matter we can take no risks. The League of Nations may succeed, or it may prove but a beautiful dream, transient and un-substantial.   The British Nation cannot afford to wake up from such a dream having-
lost supremacy of the seas. Until the League of Nations is functioning and operating wifli a success indicating permanence, then the Anglo-Celtic Empire must continue. The only form of insurance that is worth anything to us is a powerful and vigilant Navy backed by the full support and efforts of the peoples and territories which it is^ designed to guard.&quot; Mr. Watt declared that Australia had got to think on these lines! Its duty was to guard itself so far as its resources and the determination of its people permitted. Local sentiment surrounded the Australian fleet. He was for the unit and the preservation of the unit. He continued. &quot;If we can build the necessary ships in Australia, all the better ; but let us have the ships here for the protection of this country officered and manned as far as possible by Australians. Australia has grown to the full strength of manhood, and to the full responsibilities of manhood. The people of the Commonwealth do not intend any more that Australia should be a mendicant within the Empire.&quot; Mr. Watt then expressed his belief that Australians could best show their determination to share co-operatively the burdens of Empire by doing their utmost to increase the Australian Navy and according to the best advice that the British authorities could give them on this matter. Australia was not going to drop her partnership in the firm of John Bull &amp; Co. She was not going to drop out of that partnership, even if it meant considerable sacrifice to keep in it. The partnership in that firm, he said, meant everything to Australia, both from the sentimental and national point of view.Lord Jellicoe said it was very dangerous for people to suggest that certain classes of vessels were likely to disappear in future naval warfare. Thej^ could only look some 12 years ahead nowadays, as ships became obsolete in about 12 years. Great developments were going to take place both in the air and underwater craft, but he uttered a note of warning against listening too seriously either to the enthusiastic air-man or the enthusiastic submarine officer, both of whom were of the opinion that their particular arm of defence was going to be the beginning and the end of future warfare. Everyone realised how important tot the British Empire was sea command, which meant the control of the sea and the communications of the Empire.Labour Extremists.- The Labour Party Conference which is being held at Sydney has rejected (according to published reports) by 127 votes to 112 a motion substituting the extreme Socialist objective for the present policy of the Australian Labour Party.SOUTH AFRICA.Nationalist Deputation. The deputation of the Nationalist Party of South Africa was received by the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom (Mr. Lkryd George) in Paris on June 5 th. The Nationalist case was presented by General Hertzog, who put forward a claim for the restitution to the former South African Republic and Orange Free State of the national status obtaining before the South African war.In the course of his reply Mr. Lloyd George stated that he could not see how it was possible for the British Government to re-open a great settlement because of political issues which had arisen between different sections of the South African people themselves. He continued, &quot; If the British Government were to intervene it would, in my judgment, constitute an interference with those rights which were once for all conceded to South Africa when the Imperial Parliament ratified the Act of Union drawn up by a Convention of the South African people and approved by the freely elected Parliaments of the four South African Colonies.&quot;In further expressing the view of the British Government, Mr. Lloyd George emphasised that the Union of South Africa rests on a fundamental understanding and agreement between the British and Dutch elements of the people of South Africa, in which both made sacrifices and surrenders for the attainment of a great common ideal, and that the people of South Africa had exercised a free, deliberate and final choice.In dealing with some practical difficulties, Mr. Lloyd George asked whether, assuming that it was the wish of the Dutch-speaking people of the Transvaal to break away from the Union, the equally numerous British-speaking people of that Province were not entitled to any choice in regard to their status? &quot;Shall we have,&quot; he asked, &quot; then, to proceed to the partition of the Transvaal ? And if the predominantly native parts of South Africa exercise a choice in favour of separation from the Union, shaU we have to cut off native territories from the Union and its provinces ? &quot;
S194-2aBFinally, Mr. Lloyd George pointed to the status which South Africa now occupies in the world, remarking that the South African people controlled their own nationa destiny in the fullest sense, and that in the greatest Conference in history, South Africa is represented by two statesmen, of indubitably Dutch origin, who have won for South Africa an extraordinary influence in the affairs of the world. He added : &quot;In the future League of Nations, South Africa will have the same membership and status as, and far more influence than, any of the other States which are outside the ranks of the few great Powers.&quot;Diamond Cutting Industry.-The Acting Premier (Mr. Malan), in moving the second reading in the House of Assembly of the Bill empowering the establishment of a diamond cutting industry in the Union, remarked that the war had opened their eyes to the desirability of working up their own products. The three difficulties previously urged were, firstly, the cost of labour, which had largely been removed under present economic conditions; secondly, the difficulty of obtaining skilled cutters, which the Brighton experiment had shown to be exaggerated; thirdly, obtaining sufficient supply of uncut stones, on which point the Bill made a provision whereby the Government would enforce the sale of stones at current rates by jnoducers in the event of cutters and producers failing to come to an agreement.Mr. Malan emphasised that the present opportunity -was most favourable and the Government were at present negotiating with those who are ready to establish the industry.Mr. Oliver moved that the Bill be referred to a Select Committee.   The debate was then adjourned.Finance. -In the Union House of Assembly the Minister of Finance (Sir T. Orr) gave notice of the income tax proposals continuing the normal and super-taxes and increasing the Excess Profits Tax from 5s. to 10s. in the pound. The proceeds of the latter will be applied to the ordinary funds instead of to special war expenditure.Indian Trading and hand Ownership. The Governor-General of the Union of South Africa has hmvarded to the British Government for submission to His Majesty the King a message from the British Indian League of the Transvaal. This points out that as regards the Transvaal, Parliament is passing a Bill depriving British-Indian subjects of the right to hold landed property and to obtain trading licences. The message states that the Bill is based on trade jealousy and racial differentiation, and asserts that it is for the first time in the history of the Empire that such drastic legislation has been imposed on British subjects. It is also alleged that the Bill creates a dangerous precedent, practically disregards the fundamental principles upon which the Empire is based, and is destined to prevent by law Indian national industrial development. The League, therefore, beseeches His Majesty to exercise his prerogative by withholding his sanction to an unjust and unheard of piece of legislation against His Majesty&apos;s own loyal subjects.On the report stage of the Bill dealing with the ownership and occupation of land and trading by Asiatics in the proclaimed mining areas of the Transvaal (vide Report No. 122), the Governor-General of the Union has informed the British Government that a few drafting amendments were made in the Bill. As regards a new clause which had been inserted after Committee, the Acting Prime Minister expressed the hope that it would not be insisted upon owing to the objections that it imposed disability on Asiatics by name and that Asiatics had not been heard. He renewed the promise to appoint as soon as Parliament rose a strong Commission to go into the whole question of Asiatics in the Union and not merely in the Transvaal. In view, however, of the attitude of Sir Abe Bailey and others, it was not thought prudent to risk a division by moving-deletion, lire Bill passed the third reading and went to the Senate, where &quot;the new -clause was deleted by 18 votes to 7. There is a strong probability (the Governor-General adds) that the House of Assembly will acquiesce.
INDIA.Punjab. The Viceroy reported on May 29th, in continuation of previous telegrams regarding the Punjab, that in the Chakarkhana case the six accused were sentenced to death and 17 to transportation for life; the remainder were acquitted. The Lieutenant-Governor reduced to 10 years&apos; rigorous imprisonment the sentence of transportation for life passed on the seven accused in the Lahore Gate case and remitted all sentences of forfeiture. Death sentences on the two accused in the fiafizabad case were commuted by the Governor-General to transportation for life. The restrictions on the use of Padshah i Mosque, Lahore, have been removed. The Punjab Government had relaxed precensorship orders on newspapers in all but seven cases. On Sir Michael 0&apos;Dvvyer&apos;s representation martial law was abrogated on May 28th in Gujrat District and in most rural areas in the Punjab. Generally speaking martial law continued only in headquarters of four districts, a few outlying towns and all railway lands and Lyallpur. Sir Edward Maclagan assumed charge of Lieutenant-Governorship in the afternoon of May 26th./ Famine. The Viceroy reported to the India Office on June 6th that distress was spreading in the Bankura District, Bengal, owing to high prices and contraction of credit and charity. Distress was stated to be still acute in the affected tracts of Etawah District, United Provinces, and fairly severe in Kallikota and Atagada estates in Ganjain District, Madras Presidency. Water was becoming deficient in the upland tracts of Mirzapur and Banda districts of United Provinces, and was insufficient in some districts of Berar and Nerbudda Divisions of Central Provinces. The numbers relieved were as follows : Bengal : Tipperah District, this week&apos;s figures : test works, 990. Bankura District, last week figures : test works, 5,675 ; gratuitous relief, 15,284. Bihar and Orissa (incomplete figures; : relief works, 3,086 ; test works, 7,813; gratuitous relief, 8,342. Feudatory States, Orissa : test works, 23,603 ; gratuitous relief, 16,554. United Provinces : test works, 19,451 ; gratuitous relief, 16,049. Rajputana : relief works, 1,778; test works, 5,764; gratuitous relief, 2,400. Ajmer-Merwara : test woidis, 171 ; gratuitous relief, 368. Central India : Bundelkhand, this week figures : relief works, 1,440 ; gratuitous relief, 9,000. Baghelkhand, last week figures : relief works, 544 ; gratuitous relief, 59. Madras : relief works, 17,577 ; test works, 1,484 ; gratuitous relieh 50,741. Central Provinces and Bombay figures not received.The last month has seen a sharp rise in prices in Bengal and Bihar.Ruling Princes and Afghanistan. The Viceroy reported to the India Office on June 4th that when the trouble began in Afghanistan he sent a personal letter to all Ruling Princes and Chiefs explaining the situation. In their replies all important Rulers offered their resources to the Government, expressing detestation of Amir&apos;s action and their unswerving loyalty to the throne. The Nizam of Hyderabad, Begum of Bhophal, and other rulers took neeessa^- measures to ensure that their Muslim subjects should be fully enlightened as to the real circumstances of the Afghan attack, and should realise that no religious question is involved. The Nizam in placing his Imperial Service Troops and resources at the disposal of the Government of India specially asked tke Viceroy to convey his respectful and hmnbie offer to His Majesty. From among offers of personal service the rulers of Patiala, Dholpur, Ratlam, Baria, and the two sons of the Nawab of Loharu, including the heir apparent, were appointed to the staff in the field. Sir Partap was eager to go, but the Viceroy discouraged him on the grounds of the importance of his duties as Regent of Jodhpur. Other offers were tinder consideration: All the ruling Princes and Chiefs who maintain Imperial Service Troops offered their units, which in some cases had only just returned from the front. Contingents of cavalry, infantry, artillery, sappers , an cL transport from Faridkot, Gwalior, In do re, Jaipur, Kashmir, Khairpur, Maler Kotla, Patiala, Rampur, Sirmur aud Tehri had been selected for active service or garrison duty in India, and the employment of Imperial Service Troops of Bikaner, Kapurthala and Nabha was under consideration. Offer of camels, motor cars, and of money for provision of comforts for troops engaged in the campaign were being-received and accepted. Loyal messages and offers of assistance had also been received from the Chiefs and Governors of Gilgit Agency, from the Khan of Kalat and tribes in Baluchistan.
OTHER colonies, PROTECTORATES, &amp;c.EGYPT.   -The Situation. The strike in the Suez Canal area appears to continue, but otherwise there is no change in the situation in Egypt.RHODESIA.Mineral Rights in Southern Rhodesia. The British Government have been informed that a further Resolution has been passed by the Legislative Council of Southern Rhodesia (by seven votes to six, the latter being all nominated members), on the proposal of Mr. McChlery, viz.: &quot; That in view of the recent decision of His Majesty&apos;s Judicial Committee of the Privy Council as to the ownership of the unalienated land in Southern Rhodesia, and in view of the fact that the considerations on which that decision has been based do or may apply to the title to mineral rights in this territory asserted and acted upon by the British South Africa Company, this council respectfully requests that His Majesty&apos;s Imperial Government take steps to cause the alleged title of the Company to the mineral rights referred to, to be enquired into and determined, and that His Excellency the High Commissioner be respectfully requested to transmit this resolution to His Majesty&apos;s Secretary of State for the Colonies with the CounciLs humble petition that the same be given effect to as soon as possible.&quot;
