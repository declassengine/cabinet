SECRET.APPRECIATION  Oh THE ATTACHED REPORT No. 116.BRITISH  EMPIRE  AND AFRICA.Canada.The Debate in Parliament regarding the conferment of titles has shown a general feeling against class distinctions.The credit arranged for the Rumanian Government shows that the Dominion is fully alive to the importance of obtaining a share of reconstruction work in every direction. Items, in this Report indicate a definite determination that Canada shall take a prominent place in the world of industrial effort.The disfranchisement of military defaulters will be carried out in Ontario.Australian Commonwealth.The removal of restrictions as to the employment of capital and as to the erection of buildings will no doubt give satisfaction to the public and the State Governments.Efforts relating to the fostering of trade relations within the Empire and with the Allies will shortly be co-ordinated in the Commonwealth.The resignation of the Western Australian Premier does not involve any alteration in the Party complexion of the State Government.New Zealand.The Referendum figures still show a majority against Prohibition.South Africa.The Nationalist Delegation, having arrived on this side, will no doubt soon begin to make their voices heard. Fortunately the answer that can be given them is a particularly easy one. Meantime, the Nationalists in South Africa are endeavouring to keep up the anti-British sentiment.It is interesting to note that the treatment of natives on the Rand has been the subject of a keen debate in Parliament.India.The latest information regarding the riots leads to the belief that the disturbances have received a good- deal of artificial stimulation. The public explanation of the Rowlatt Act may serve to remove one of the pretexts for the trouble.Other Colonies, Protectorates, &amp;c.The outstanding features of the situation in Egypt are the continued strike of Government employees, the resignation of Rushdy Pasha, and the publication in Egypt of the recognition of the British Protectorate by the United States. Generally speaking the country remains outwardly quiet, but the political agitation is as strong as ever.H. d&apos;E.April 25th, 1919.

BRITISH   EMPIRE   AND   AFRICA  REPORT/SELF-GOVERNING   DOMINIONS..* ;-   CANADA.        &apos; :       -   -      .   -Conferment&apos;of Titles. After a long debate in the House of Commons, on the question of titles, a vote was taken on a sub-amendment proposed by the Acting Premier (Sir Thomas White) to the effect that the whole matter be referred tea Select Committee, with power to investigate and present a report. Seventy-one members voted in favour of this course, and 64 against.Mr. W. F. Nickle (U., Kingston) moved that an address be presented to the King praying that no further titles be conferred on British subjects domiciled in Canada. He argued that in a democratic country class distinctions should be done away with as far as possible, and equality of citizenship established. &quot; Mr. Nickle traced the institution of knighthood from its beginning,, saying that in feudal days the privilege carried with it an obligation to give military service, and it was not possible to apply the conditions of the Middle Ages to the England and Canada of to-day.Mr. R. L. Richardson (U., Springfield, Man.) followed, saying the country was practically unanimously opposed to titles. Finally, he moved, and Mr. Robert Cruise (U., Dauphin, Man.) seconded, an amendment to the effect that hereditary titles be clone away with in Canada on the decease of the present holders.Mr. Fred Parclee (U., Lamb ton W.) said titles were not good for the country. &quot; In these days of reconstruction,&quot;-he proceeded, &quot; my Liberalism is perhaps better than ever, because I believe the country needs it, but, when this matter was up last session, I sunk my convictions and voted against in order to support the Government in war time.&quot;The Acting Premier (Sir Thomas&apos;White) explained the Governments attitude. He reviewed the position of past Governments in the matter, including the initial action of Sir Wilfrid Laurier in 1902 and the further advance made, on the recom-mendation of Sir Robert Borden, to the effect that no titular honours be granted in Canada without the consent of the Premier of the Dominion.Credit for Rumania. A return which has been tabled in the Dominion Parlia-meut gives some details of the credit for S 25,000,000 which has been arranged in Canada for the Government of Rumania, and which will enable that country to purchase goods in Canada for reconstruction work. The Order-in-Council authorising the credit provides that any unemployed portion of the credit shall be cancelled on December 31st, 1919, unless a new contract be entered into with the Rumanian Government. The credit is guaranteed by debentures of the Kingdom of Rumania at an interest of 5-J- per cent, payable half-yearly, and is to be repayable after the expiration of five years both as to principal and interest.Trade Relations : Expansion of Exports. The President of the Dominion Steel Corporation (Mr. Mark Workman) has just returned, to Canada after a two months&apos; trip to Great Britain and France, and has stated in an interview that he was greatly impressed.with the possibilities of future Canadian trade relations with Great Britain, France and Belgium, although for the time being the uncertainty of conditions brought about by the lack of definite Peace news had created a want of confidence on the part of buyers who would be in a position to place large orders. Owing to the condition^ of the labour market he considered that Great Britain had lost some of her former great advantages, and added : &quot; Consequently Canada is in a much more favourable position to reach out for the .export trade which is an absolute necessity to-day in order to permit the Dominion to provide for her war debt.&quot; Mr. Workman said further : &quot; The paramount necessity is shipping facilities. For many years to come transportation wdll be the most vital factor in export trade. Accordingly Canada must carefully consider the problem, and concurrently must organise an elastic export banking system with special facilities for taking care of commercial paper, as practised in the United States.&quot;
Revenue. When Sir Thomas White, the Canadian Minister of Finance, presents his&apos;Budget shortly,&apos;he will be able-to announce a revenue for the year ended March last in excess of the estimate.. In the last Budget the revenue was estimated at $270,000,000&apos;. The Statement of the Department of Finance shows total revenues received&apos; during the fiscal year just past amounting to $305,230,000. AThe greatest increase is due to direct taxation such as the Income War Tax and the Business War Profits Tax. - s - &apos; * - -.v      - -    &quot;   - . -   &apos;   .    - ,.&apos;:New Steamship Lines. The inauguration of new steamship lines is announced. The Canada steamship lines, working in conjunction with La Campagnie Generale Trans-Atlantique, are organising a subsidiary company for the purpose of operating a service between Montreal and Le Havre, with St. John as the winter-port. Six vessels will serve this line, and a weekly service will be provided. - Messrs. McLean and Kennedy announce the inauguration of a service between Montreal and Buenos Aires and Monte Video by the Houston Line.   St. John will be the winter port.Coastal Patrol Fleet.-The Dominions coastal, patrol . fleet increased from 11 vessels in 1913 to 133. at the end of 1918,,according to a return tabled in Parlia-ment.   These vessels include only those flying the Naval White Ensign.Ontario Cabinet and Labour. Recognising the importance of labour in the present period of. reconstruction, the Premier of Ontario (Sir William Hearst) has decided to take into the Cabinet a Labour representative who has the full confidence of working men. . . &apos;. -Necessary legislation to this end will be introduced and the- appointment will take place wdien the work of the Department of Labour has developed to a point which needs the supervision of a member of the Government.Disfranchisement of Military Defaidters. A measure has been introduced into the &quot;Ontario Legislature by the Attorney-General, providing for the &quot;disfranchisement of Military Service Act defaulters and others guilty of seditious and treasonable offences during the war.. Under the measure all such persons will be deprived,of the vote for a period of 10 years. .AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH.Removal of Restrictions on Capiiat.-Th.e Cabinet has decided to amend the War Precautions Regulations in order to. provide for greater, liberality in connection with the Government control of capital issues.       .Empire-Trade:- A Conference held in the Melbourne Town Hall, of 10 organisations interested in Empire trade has -unanimously resolved to create new industries and to foster existing industries in Australia ; also to buy no enemy goods but to give preference firstly to Australian and British manufacturers, and secondly to establish reciprocal trade, with the Allies. A committee has been formed to co-ordinate these efforts.Aerial Transport. The Federal Treasury has granted permission for the registration of a limited company for aerial transport. It claims to be backed by leading financiers, and proposes to make immediate surveys of routes, the arrange-ment of aerodrome sites and other preliminaries. The company expects to commence flying services between the capital and cities about July 1920. The. shareholders, are all of British birth.Removal of Restrictions on Building. The Acting .Prime Minister (Mr. Watl) has announced that it is intended to amend the War Precautions Regulations in order to make Treasury consent.&apos; unnecessary for the erection of new buildings for amuse-ments, churches, schools, hotels or liquidation companies, except where it is intended to remove registration elsewhere.Deportation of Bolsheviks. The Federal Cabinet have approved of the deportation of certain Bolsheviks to Odessa.Quarantine Restrictions on Shipping. The Acting Prime Minister (Mr. Watt) has sent an ultimatum to the Queensland, West Australian and Tasmanian Governments to withdraw their quarantine restrictions on shipping, which is causing a coal shortage, or. he will transfer the tonnage employed on their coasts to more -remunerative trade routes. &quot;V^v^i --
Soldiers&apos;Homes: Government Assistance. The War Service Act, nOw in force, provides facilities for Australian soldiers, sailors and -nurses who have served abroad, to obtain&quot; homes&quot;&quot;, also soldiers&apos; and sailors&apos; widows, the widowed mothers of unmarried deceased soldiers and sailors, and mothers whose husbands have been incapacitated. The maximum assistance will be TOOL, and eligible persons may acquire a dwelling and land from the Commissioner oil the rent-purchase system at cost price, pins 51., to be repaid in weekly or monthly instalments within a period which may extend over 20 to 37 years. The Act also provides&apos; for advances on mortgage on similar terms for the erection of houses on applicants&apos; land, the taking over of existing mortgages, and for pensions. -West Australian Premiership. The ballot for the leadership of the Nationalist Party at Perth resulted in Mr. Lefroy, the Premier, tying with Mr. Colebatch, Minister for Education, with 15 votes each. Mr. Lefroy subsequently resigned the Premiership.The Government has been constituted as follows: Mr. Colebatch, Premier and Treasurer and Minister for Railways and Education ; Mr Mitchell; Lands and Repatriation ; Mr. George, Works and Water Supply ; Mr. Robinson, Attorney-General and Minister for Mines arid Industries; Mr. LIudson, Colonial Secretary; Mr. Baxter, Agriculture ; Mr. Wilmott, Minister without portfolio.Prohibition in South Australia.-The South Australian Premier (Mr. A. H. Peake) on April 13th announced that he strongly opposes prohibition without compensation. In any.case, the Premier declared, he is opposed to the taking of a referendum on the ground that in his opinion such a course is undemocratic.NEW ZEALAND.Prohibition Referendum. The latest returns sent by cable of April 19th show that in the referendum a majority of 14,600 has been given against prohibition.Absence of Political Leaders: Work of Reconstruction. The Minister of Internal Affairs (Mr. G. W. Russell) in a recent speech is reported to have said that the leaders of the country, Mr. Massey and Sir Joseph Ward, were away rendering the Dominion important service, but he could not shut his eyes to the fact that the Government were tremendously handicapped by their absence at a time when the country required every possible effort to meet the position which has arisen out of the war. No sooner would the leaders be back than the country would be faced by a general election. It would be a&apos; disaster if through any political developments the country did not undertake before Parliament meets in the ordinary course in June 1920, the work of reconstruction arising out of the war. Many things required consideration, but in the absence of the leaders he could not speak out. The position had given him the greatest anxiety, for he felt that now was the time when the country&apos; should be using every effort to assist development.SOUTH A ERICA.Nationalist Delegation.  The Nationalist Delegation have arrived in London, and are staying at the Imperial Hotel, Russell Square.The Delegation have addressed a letter to Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s private secretary asking the British Government to receive a deputation. This letter has been forwarded to Paris.Nationalists and the Navy. In the debate in the House of Assembly on April 23rd, the Nationalist Deputy Leader (Mr. Wilcoeks) moved the omission of the contribution of 85,000Z.. for the British Navy from the Estimates, contending that the Union owed nothing to the protectiori of the Navy. Mr. Merriman reminded the House that the late Mr. Jan Hofmeyer and Mr. Theron, leaders of the Afrikander Bond, supported the original naval contribution of the Cape, and that General Bertzog had also adopted a similar attitude as a member of the Conference on Imperial Defence.Treatment of Natives. On April 10th, Mr. J. W. J agger raised in the Union House of Assembly the question of the recent treatment of natives in Johannesburg. The Leader of the Opposition (Sir Thomas Smartt) said the reports tended to show a great deal of unnecessary hostility towards the natives, and he-expressed apprehension
lest the natives should obtain the impression that a different justice existed for Europeans and natives. Mr. Merriman advocated tbe abolition of the colour-bar on the Rand Mines and giving the natives a fair chance of advancement.. The Labour Leader (Colonel Creswell) opposed Mr. Merriman&apos;s attitude, contending that the colour-bar was a bribe made by the mine-owners, who told the miners they must not degrade themselves by doing manual labour. He questioned whether the natives Avould benefit if the bar were removed, and accused Mr. Merriman when he Avas Premier of the Cape of Good Hope of fostering the supply&apos; of native labour for the mines. The Labour Members, Colonel Creswell declared, had consistently favoured the policy of encouraging the natives to develop themselves in their own territories and of working the mines by free white labour.The Minister of Justice (Mr. de Wet), who has recently returned from Johannes--burg, where he specially dealt with the native trouble, acknowledged that order existed in the native territories, but pjointed out that Johannesburg had a large floating-population, including a number of criminals, who were always in the forefront of disturbances. Three hundred natives had been arrested including 30 criminals with long records. He had received a deputation from the South African Native Congress and had assured it that the Government would consider an amendment of the Pass Law and would maintain its sympathetic attitude towards the natives. Incidentally Mr. de Wet remarked that it was impossible to bring a criminal charge against the recent Board of Control at Johannesburg. He also expressed sympathy with the coloured workers in the building trade at Johannesburg who had been prevented from working by the strike of white workmen. Measures were being taken to assist them, but it was impossible to provide police to protect them against molestation while at work.INDIA.Riots.The Viceroy has reported to the India Office to the following effect: Punjab. A telegram of April 20th indicated that five rioters were killed, and 12 arrested in the collision already reported with rioters at Chuharkama. At Basal in the Campbell pur District [near Gujerat] unrest was reported on the 19th. Mobs burnt Sangla Hill [in Gujranwala district] railway station and Sidhwan flag station and damaged Iiaithal station [65 miles southwest of Ambala]. In several districts wire cutting continues.On the 15th a mob wrecked Gujerat station and had to be fired on. All quiet there now ; also at Amritsar and Lahore ; but students tore down notices as to martial law and were arrested in consequence. A telegram of April 22nd reported that schoolboys and Saclhus took a very prominent part in the riots at Kasur. A telegram of April ^3rd showed that arrests there and at Amritsar were numerous.A telegram of April 23rd reported strikes at Gogra and Lyallpur. In the Lyallpur district martial law had been proclaimed in view of anti-British propaganda and the cutting of telegraph wires.North-West Frontier Province. Peshawar movement is essentially Hindu; a Committee calling itself the Committee of Union has been organised from outside. A telegram of i^pril 22nd reported all was quiet, and that further demonstrations were being discouraged by the Union Committee as a result of their interview with the Chief Commissioner.Delhi. Quiet, but reported that merchants elsewhere are having pressure brought upon them by Delhi merchants by refusal to honour hundis (ietters remitting money), and that trouble is being stirred up in neighbouring districts of Punjab by emissaries, from Delhi.Bombay.-All quiet. An excellent effect has been produced by the ready-volunteering at Deolali of demobilising troops. Muhammadan feeling was stated to be setting against Gandhi. The Satyagraha Committee on April 18th resolved to suspend temporarily civil disobedience . to the laws. Gandhi said he had underrated the forces of evil and advised his followers to co-operate with the Government.   A
telegram of April 23rd reported that in -the Northern Division and in Sind there had been extensive promulgation of seditions pamphlets.Calcutta. Nothing reported.United Provinces. -A railway strike has been threatened, but there is no trorible as yet. The leaders so far have successfully restrained the Moslems, though they have strong feeling as regards Turkey and cognate questions.The return to Lucknow of Abdul Bari and bis companions is reported.At Meerut inflammatory notices have been posted addressed to the troops.Hoivlatt Act. Owing to reports that Bidian officers and men had been questioning their British officers in regard to the Rowlatt Act, the Government of India, with the approval of the Commander-in-Chief, have prepared a pamphlet, a translation of which will be read by commanding officers to the Indian troops.After a clear explanation of the scope and objects of the Act, the pamphlet states that the law is absolutely necessary to protect the lives and propertjr of faithful officers and peaceful subjects, and continues : &quot; You who have seen something of the world and helped to win the great war know the principles for which the Sirkar [Government] fought-to promote liberty and justice and to stop the oppression of the weak. You know the Sirkai would never pass an unjust or repressive law.&quot;Dealing with the disturbances, it points out that passive resistance having been understood by the ignorant and inflammable sections of the population and professional budviash.es to justify murder, loot and arson, mobs have attacked the troops and police, murdered many Europeans, and burnt and destroyed valuable property. In several places the troops or the police, after patient endurance of these attacks, have been forced to fire on the crowds, and, as is inevitable, the innocent have been killed or wounded with the guilty. This is deeply to be regretted, but it is the paramount duty of the Government to preserve law and order and protect- peaceful citizens. No Government failing in this duty can continue to govern, and the Sirkar will not flinch from any action to ensure that that duty is performed.The Government suggest that Local Governments should prepare vernacular leaflets on the same lines and circulate them in all their towns and districts.It was reported on April 13th, from Bombay, that Rai Bahadur Bishan Dutt Shukul had resigned his membership of the Yiceroy&apos;s Council as a protest against the Rowlatt Act,Famine. The Viceroy reported to the India Office on April 20th that famine had been declared in part of Satara District, Bombay Presidency, and scarcity in part of Basti and Mirzapur Districts, United Provinces, Drug District, Central Provinces, and Broach District, and Rewa Kantha Agency in Bombay Presidency. Test works had been started in Bikaner State and in nine feudatory States of Orissa, and relief&apos;works were being started in Kallikota and Attagacla Estates in Ganjam District. Distress was very slight in Saugor and the situation easier in Jubbulpore. The number of works in most districts of the Central Provinces had been temporarily reduced owing to labourers going to gather mahua crop. The number of persons on works were increasing in Bombay. Distress was still acute in Jumna Ckambal tract, Etawah District, United Provinces. The numbers relieved were as follows : Bengal : test works, 1,429 ; District Board- works, 4,555 ; gratuitous relief, G,G08. Bihar and Orissa : test works, 12,823 ; gratuitous relief not reported. Feudatory States, Orissa : test works, 15,651; -gratuitous relief, 9,445. United Provinces : test works, 12,128 ; gratuitous relief, 13,590. Rajputana : relief works, 5,084 ; gratuitous relief, 101. Ajmer-Merwara : test- works, 8 ; gratuitous relief, 309. Central India : relief works, 12,445; gratuitous relief, 5,755. Central Provinces : works, 31,818 ; gratuitous relief, 33,273. Bombay: relief works,-64,034 ; village works, 3,672; test works, 2,169; gratuitous relief, 75,625.  Madras : works, 10,172 ; gratuitous relief, 23,516.European Association. The Council of the European Association has deputed its secretary to proceed to London to lay the Association^ views before the British jDublic.
other COLONIES, PROTECTORATES, &amp;c.118EGYPT.Development of the Situation. On April15th General Allenhy telegraphed that the strike of Government officials showed further signs of spreading to the provinces. In Cairo, strikers on the tramways had thrown vitriol at fellow employees to prevent their working, great inconvenience was being caused to the railway and postal services by the strikes. The foreign communities were somewhat uneasy, but steps were being taken for their protection should it prove necessary.No further incidents occurred up to the 21st, when General Allenby reported that an attempt had been made to damage the railway near Mansura.In the meantime, the Egyptian Nationalist Delegation had reached Paris, where they had represented to the French Press that the movement in Egypt was directed towards obtaining the independence of the country, that it had no religious or anti-foreign character, nor any connection with Young Turk or German agents. Great stress was laid by them on the fact that French property in Egypt was being-protected by the Nationalists.On the 2-2nd, General Allenby telegraphed that he had issued a Proclamation under Martial Law ordering all Government officials to return to their posts forthwith. He warned them that they would receive no pay for the period during which they had been absent, and if they had not returned to work on the following day they would be struck off the list of Government officials. Any person attempting to prevent officials from resuming work would be liable to arrest and prosecution before a Military Court.Previous to the issue of this Proclamation, Rushdy Pasha had asked to be allowed to resign the Premiership. General Allenby had advised the Sultan to accept his resignation as he had obviously lost his influence over the country and his colleagues.On the same day the American Consul-Generai in Cairo handed an official note to General Allenby stating that he was directed to acquaint him with the fact that the President recognised the British Protectorate over Egypt. In according this recognition the President must reserve for further discussion the details thereof, together with the question of the modification of any rights belonging to the United States which might be entailed by this decision. The latter added that while the President and the American people had every sympathy with the legitimate aspirations of the Egyptian people for a further measure of self-government, they viewed with regret any effort to obtain the realisation thereof hy a resort to violence.FOREIGN COLONIES, &amp;c. IN AFRICA.GERMAN COLONIES.Germans and French Colonial Policy. German Wireless of April 16th commented as follows : &quot; The Journal Officiel published in November and January last a list of Germany&apos;s misdeeds in the administration of Cameroon and Togoland, the object of which was clearly to prove that these territories must be confined to more tender hands. The German Ministry of Colonies has replied to these charges in a voluminous memorandum entitled &apos; German and French Treatment of Natives.&apos; After proving the baselessness of the reproaches brought against German administration in Cameroon and Togoland, the memorandum deals with the mistakes and faults of French Colonial policy, e.g., militarism, drink, maladministration in Indo-China, violence and oppression in Madagascar, and a policy of exploitation and demoralisation in Northern Africa. An article by Morel in the Contemporary Pleviexo of December 1911, is quoted to show how French intrigues in the Colonies were condemned in other countries.&quot;
