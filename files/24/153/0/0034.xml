SECRET.APPRECIATION OP THE ATTACHED  UK PORT No. 128.BRITISH  EMPIRE  AND  AFRICA.Canada.Some indication of the work which lies before the Government is given in this Report.While there is a distinct effort being made to secure the farmers&apos; support, for the Liberals on the tariff issue, there seems to be more probability of the farmers forming a party of their own.Representative men in the Trades and Labour Congress appear determined to root out the Bolshevist element.The Conference upon Industrial Relations may prove of considerable importance and value.Australian Commonwealth.4t The efforts of the Opposition to carry a motion of want of confidence in the Government have apparently led to disorderly scenes in Parliament, All indications point to a campaign of some bitterness between the National and Labour Parties prior to the General Election next year.The persistent refusal of the seamen to enter the Arbitration Court is likely to make the position regarding the strike still more- difficult.An important telegram has been sent to the British Government relating to the deferred rebate system of the Shipping Conference.OrriEii Colonies, Protectorates, &amp;o.The decision to abolish the Military Courts set up to try persons implicated in the recent disorders in Egypt show how completely tranquillity has now been restored.Foreign Colonies.It would be interesting to see in what way the German authorities endeavoured to obtain the opinion of the people of Uuala regarding German rule.H. d&apos;E.July 17th, 1919.

BRITISH  EMPIRE   AND   AFRICA  REPORT.SELF-GOVERNING   DOMINIONS.CANADA.Minister and League of Nations. The Dominion Minister of Justice (Mr. C. J.: Doherty), on arriving in Canada, has made a statement regarding the Peace Treaty and the League of Nations. The Minister considers that the League of Nations is a great boon, in that it gives to the world an organisation which will bring co-operation between the nations for the preservation of peace and the establishment and main-&apos; tenance of justice in international relations. Speaking of Canada&apos;s admittance to the League, Mr. Doherty said this was the most formal recognition of her status among the nations.Government and Parliament. Much work remains to be done by the Government in the interim before the Autumn Session. A Public Health Department will be established, and the Canadian National Railway directorate will be organised. The Health Department Bill iDermits the appointment of a new Cabinet Minister, but it is probable that a present member of the Cabinet will be assigned the new department. It is expected that the railway directorate will remain practically as it is at present constituted.Amongst the rumoured legislative probabilities of the next Session is a Bill which will place the Senate on an elective basis. Cabinet reconstruction is expected when Sir Robert Borden returns from his holiday. The task of reconstruction kas been rendered more difficult by the decision of Sir Thomas White to retire from the Ministry of Finance.Liberal Convention. On the rising of Parliament the Opposition Leader (Mr. D. D. Mackenzie) left for his Nova Scotia home, but he will return shortly to commence his campaign for the Liberal Party Convention. It is expected that 800 delegates will attend this Convention. The National Liberal Committee meets at Ottawa on July 31st to arrange the agenda of the great Liberal Convention which takes place on August 5th to August 8th. Provincial Premiers and Leaders of Opposition will compose the Committee. Notification has been received that the Canadian Council of Agriculture will not send a representative to the Convention, although a memorandum elaborating the Farmers&apos; platform will be sent for con-sicleration.Tariff and Next Election. At the first of a series of 16 Liberal conventions being held in Saskatchewan, Mr. Martin, the Premier, declared that the next election would be fought over the tariff, and that the East would have to make substantial concessions before a compromise would be considered.Mr. H. Mackenzie, Vice-President of the Canadian Council of Agriculture, and one of the most powerful supporters of the movement to form a Farmers&apos;Political Party in Canada, has predicted that SO farmers will be members of the House of Commons after the next General Election.Mr. Mackenzie states that these 80 members will represent, ridings scattered from coast to coast, and will be pledged to the farmers&apos; platform whose strong plank is tariff reduction. Botk Dr. Michael Clark and Mr. T. A. Crerar are mentioned as possible party leaders.Labour Congress and One Big Union. The Dominion Trades and Labour Congress are taking vigorous action against the &quot; One Big Union &quot; movement, and the opening of the campaign has already been launched at Winnipeg under the leadership of Mr. William Varley, of Toronto, and Mr. R. A. Rigg, a former secretary of the Trades and Labour Council, and the recently appointed general organiser of the Western Canada Trades and Labour Congress. It is intended that organised labour, not only in Winnipeg but throughout the West, shall be swept clean of revolutionary doctrines. Every local Union will be called upon to prove loyalty to the principles of Labour in the past and to show their genuineness by any reorganisation that may be necessary.
The struggle between the Socialists and the Trade Union element will be fought, out at the annual meeting of the Dominion Trades and Labour Congress at Hamilton in September. The low tariff group among the forces of labour, which is almost identical with the Socialist element, will oppose any movement towards Protection, while the Socialists will try to secure a vote in favour of the One Big Union.Industrial Relations. The Prime Minister (Sir Robert Borden) has communicated to the Press an important manifesto regarding industrial and Labour conditions. In part, the manifesto reads as follows :  &quot; As announced by the Governor-General in his speech at the prorogation of Parliament, the Government intends to summon in a few weeks a representative Conference for the purpose of holding a friendly and intimate discussion between employers and employed in order to. consider the report of the Industrial Relations Committee.&quot; The Provincial Governments will be invited to send representatives, and the various organisations of employees and employers will be requested to appoint . committees.    It is hoped  that tbe Conference will be  productive of  a  better understanding and more co-operation.&quot; .   &quot;   ,The Labour Sub-Committee under the Minister of Labour (Senator Gideon Robertson) is making arrangements for the coming National Industrial Conference. It is first deciding how the various associations and unions of employers and employees shall be represented, and the method by which the representatives will be chosen. The date of the Conference is likely to be early in August, and it is confidently expected that as a result of the proceedings the way will be p)aved for a permanent Council, which will Handle all industrial disputes.The Conference will probably consist of 400 members 200 employers, and a similar number of working men&apos;s representatives. The Conference will be the first of its kind in the Dominion&apos;s history.Federal Court of Commerce. -A Federal Court of Commerce will soon be instituted to inquire into combines and trusts injuriously controlling trade and enhancing tbe prices of commodities.Shipbuilding. Another 10 million dollars has been voted for the Canadian Governments shipbuilding programme, making a total of 40 millions during the past session of Parliament.Business with the Enemy. An Order in Council was issued on June 23rd per-mitting, under certain license restrictions, the resumption of trade between Canada and rjersons resident or carrying on business in an enemy country or occupied territory.AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH.Confidence in the Government. In the Commonwealth House of Representatives, on July 2nd, Mr. W. G. Higgs (who was Treasurer of the Commonwealth in a former Labour Government) moved a vote of want of confidence in the Government on various grounds. The Acting Prime Minister (Mr. Watt), in replying, said that&apos; the charge that the Government had tried to delay demobilisation was false and malicious. In the course of the debate on July 4th disorderly scenes occurred which resulted in the suspension of the sitting. Two Labour Members (Messrs. Mahony and Considine) were suspended.^Seamen s Strike. The Government having decided to institute proceedings under the Arbitration Act, a summons was served on the Secretary of the Seamen&apos;? Union on July 14th.It is announced in the Press that Mr. Walsh and other extremists intend appealing to British .seamen to declare a general strike within the Empire if the Federal Government persists in prosecuting the strike leaders. Mr. Walsh openly declares that he means to throw Melbourne into darkness and secure a settlement by force. Mr. Riley, the organiser of the wharf labourers, referring to the terrible distress now prevailing, suggested that none need starve while millions of carcases in cold storage, the property of the British Government, could be secured by direct action.   The extremists have persuaded the men to refuse to enter an Arbitration Court.Victoria and Land Settlement. The Governor of Victoria (Sir A. Stanley), in opening the Victorian Parliament on July 8th, said he anticipated that the land8426-3a A 2
settlement of soldiers would cost the State 10,000,000Z. Recognising the urgent need of increased population, he said the Government would encourage the immigration of suitable settlers from the Imperial armies.Shipments by Government Line. The Acting Prime Minister (Mr. Watt) has telegraphed to the British Government with reference to shipments by vessels of the Government of the Commonwealth of Australia Line in relation to the deferred rebate system of the Shipping Conference whereby full freight is to be paid in the hrst instance, and, at the end of 12 months, if the shipper declares that he has not departed from the Conference lines, he obtains a rebate equal to 10 per cent, on freight paid during the first six months of the 12. The shipowner, it is pointed out, thus retains the right to cause the shipper to forfeit 12 months&apos; rebate if lie wishes, and the shipowner further has always in hand six months&apos; rebate.It is therefore suggested for the consideration of the British Government that with a view to protecting Commonwealth funds, legislation should be introduced by the Imperial Government similar to the Australian Industries Part I. Act 1906/10, which provides that any person who, in relation to trade or commerce with other countries or among States, either as principal or agent in respect of dealings with any goods or services, gives, offers or promises to any other person, any rebate; refund, &amp;c, for the reason or upon the condition&apos; that the latter person deals exclusively with any person, shall be guilty of an offence, and every contract entered into of the kind referred to shall be illegal and void.If such legislation is not practicable, the Commonwealth Government suggest that advantage might be taken to include in the functions of the proposed Investi-gation Board, the duty of enquiring into complaints from persons or bodies interested with regard to ocean freights, facilities and conditions in inter-Imperial trade.NEW ZEALAND.Labour Party and Peace Treaty.-The New Zealand Labour Party have issued a manifesto condemning the terms of the Peace Treaty will Germany.INDIA.Famine. The Viceroy telegraphed to the India Office on July 11th that scarcity was reported from the Sirajganj Sub-division in Pabna district, and from two circles in the Chittagong Hill tracts of Bengal. Distress was generally slight in the United Provinces where prospects had improved owing to the recent rains. - There were no special developments elsewhere. The numbers relieved were as follows : Bengal: relief works, 6,492 ; test works, 2,536 ; gratuitous relief, 20,039. Bihar and Orissa : relief works, 5,207 ; test works, 5,173 ; gratuitous relief, 25,648. Feudatory States of Orissa report not received. United Provinces : test works, 17,362 ; gratuitous relief, 19,652. Rajputana : relief works, 884; test works, 4,853; gratuitous relief, 2,400. Ajmer-Merwara : test works, 435; gratuitous relief, 408. Central India: relief works, 12,974; gratuitous relief, 11,275. Central Provinces : relief works, 12,173; test works, 9,811; gratuitous relief, 45,443. Bombay: relief works, 27,673 ; test works, 906 ; gratuitous relief, 94,756 ; dependants, 14,226 ; village works, 5,498.&apos; Madras: relief works, 52,592; test works, 1,848; gratuitous relief, incomplete figures, 85,279. Exportable surplus Burma rice was stated to have exceeded expectations, and the reduction of shipments to India in next two months was unlikely.Viceroy^ Executive Council. Bis Majesty the King has approved of the appointment of Khan Bahadur Mian Muhammad Shafi, C.I.E., as successor to Sir Saakaran Nair on the Viceroy&apos;s Executive Council.
OTHER COLONIES, PROTECTORATES, &amp;c.EGYPT.Situation. General Allenby reports that as tranquillity has now heen completely restored in Egypt it has been decided to abolish the military courts set up to try persons implicated in the recent disorders. After july 15th all cases wid be dealt with by the civil authorities, except offences against members of the British forces. Persons interned in Egypt as a result of the recent troubles are to be released.The Press censorship was removed on the day peace with Germany was signed, and has now also been abolished on letters from Egypt to abroad.FOREIGN COLONIES, &amp;c. IN AFRICA.THE GERMAN COLONIES.Duala and German Rule. German Wireless of July 11th stated that the people of l)uala have joined in the general protest against the robbery of Geimiany&apos;s colonies. In a communication to the National Assembly it is asserted that they swore unswerving loyalty to Germany, with whom they wished to live in sincere friendship. The message continues: &quot; It is observed officiaUy in this connection that the communication affords fresh proof of the falsity of the English statement that the natives of Africa had no other wish than to be freed from Germany, and to be received into the protecting arms of England.&quot;
