SECRET.APPRECIATION OF THE ATTACHED REPORT No. 101.BRITISH EMPIRE  AND AFRICA.Imperial Affairs.The further information given as to proposals for Dominion and Indian representatives-sentation at the Peace Conference should be read in connection with the paragraph under this heading appearing in the Report of last week.Canada.The fact that the total casualties in the Canadian forces closely approximate to a quarter of a million affords eloquent testimony regarding Dominion effort and more than a justification of the national claims for an effective voice in the settlement.The plea of the Premier of Alberta in relation to the conflicting interests of Eastern and Western Canada may be said to represent the Free Trade attitude of many of the Western farmers. It should be remembered that Mr. Stewart has been frequently spoken of in connection with the future leadership of the Liberal Party.The proposals for the establishment of a Central Institute for Industrial and Scientific Research are indicative of a determination to place Canada in as favourable a position as the United States in the work of applying science to industry.Australian Common wealth .The facts unofficially given as to the work of Australians in France lead to the hope that a full official account will be available before long.New Zealand.It no\v appears that the Prime Minister and Sir Joseph Ward cannot arrive before January 18th.South Africa.The impossibility of any official recognition being given to the Nationalists has been again made clear.The coloured people have shown their determination to support the natives in claiming political rights in the Union and in captured African territory.The land settlement scheme which Sir P. FitzPatrick is coming to England to promote will probably be found to appeal to a good type of English settler who, through
injuries or other causes, is prevented from undertaking heavy work. South Africa, with its supply of native labour, will be found specially suitable for wounded officers with some capital.German Colonies.The remarkable article appearing in the organ of the German Social-Democrat Party indicates that a Socialist Government will be cjuite ready to claim a Colonial Empire, though on somewhat different grounds to those which have hitherto prevailed.H. d&apos;E.January 9th, 1919.

BRITISH  EMPIRE  AND  AFRICA  REPORT.IMPERIAL AFFAIRS^Dominion and Indian Representation at Peace Conference. With reference to the decision of the Imperial War Cabinet regarding the representation of the Dominions and India at the Peace Conference, which was communicated to the French Government [vide Report No. 100), the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom informed the Imperial War Cabinet at the meeting which dealt with the subject that in all discussions it had been intended to include in the five delegates representing Great Britain one representative of the Dominions and India. The Imperial War Cabinet, besides agreeing to the measures outlined in Report No. 100, decided that the Prime Ministers of the5 Dominions and the representatives of India should be placed on a panel from which part of the personnel of the British dele-gation could be filled, according to the subject for discussion.SELF-GOVERNING   DOMINIONS.CANADA.Total Casualties. The total casualties from all causes in the Canadian forces during the war were 220,182.&apos; The deaths reached a total of 60,383. Of these, 35,666 were killed in action, 12,420 died of wounds, and 5,405 died of disease. The total wounded was 155,799.Cost of Pensions. An actuarial calcidation, which has been furnished by the Dominion Minister of Finance (Sir Thomas White) estimates the total cost of the Canadian pensions on a three per cent, basis at $440,000,000. It is calculated that the maximum of pensions will not be reached for 18 months or two years. It is further estimated that the maximum will remain for a period of five years, and that it will then gradually diminish until pensions entirely terminate.Free Trade: Interests of East and West. The Premier of Alberta (Mr. Stewart) made some important references to Free Trade and the interests of the Eastern and Western Provinces of the Dominion at the closing meeting of the United Grain Growers Convention. Mr. Stewart predicted that in less than 10 years the greatest part of the population of Canada would be living west of the Great Lakes. He advised the East to stop and consider their treatment of the West, as they would deplore retaliation on the part of the West when the latter was able to repay the. injustices of the past. He declared that he would like to see Canada a united nation within the British Empire, and urged the East to give the West a square deal. Continuing, Mr. Stewart said : &quot; We are not satisfied to continue to remain under the burden of carrying the Government. . Never was the time better to discuss the question of Free Trade and to settle it. There must be a reasonable reduction in the burdens of the farmers of the Dominion, and it must be loaded on the shoulders where it belongs.&quot;Western Conservatives. Mr. Robert Rogers, the former Minister of Public Works, attended a gathering last week of over 1,000 Conservatives, representing many parts of Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta, at Winnipeg. The former Minister reiterated his sentiments expressed at the recent Toronto banquet, calling on
the old-time Conservatives to prepare for the coming struggle. He declared that Unionism would end with the signing of peace terms. He stated that the Liberals were reorganising along the old lines, and that it behoved Conservatives to prepare themselves for the coming tussle.Institute for Industrial and Scientific Research. At a meeting of the Recon-struction and Development Committee of the Cabinet held recently, Dr. A. B. Macallum, Administrative Chairman of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, advanced the long-considered proposal of the Council for the establishment of a Central Institute for research. The scheme contemplates the immediate erection, at or near the capital, of a central laboratory building costing approximately $500,000. The building, as planned, will provide room for expansion as the needs develop, but will at first -have accommodation for some 50 laboratories covering all the essential industrial research subjects. In a general way it is designed to fulfil for Canada the functions now performed for the United States by the Bureau - of Standards at Washington and the Mellon Institute at Pittsburg. It will provide modern scientific equipment and methods for investigations of Canadian raw material, industrial processes, and manufactured products. It will serve as a national laboratory for standards of all sorts, for the testing of materials, for the discovery of methods of utilising by-products of manufacture hitherto wasted, and generally for experimental work in the application of science to industry. The proposed national research laboratory will also be of incalculable value to the various trade guilds now being promoted by the Research Council in the leading Canadian industries.Disbanding of Naval Air Service. Notices were issued last month by the Department of Naval Service for the demobilisation of the Royal Canadian Naval Air Service. Steps were taken to organise this division some time ago, and a number of cadets were entered for training. Some of these were sent to England and some of them to the United States to take a preliminary course in the special schools and then take up the flying training. The need for the coast protection which was to be given by these men having disappeared, it was. arranged that the training of- the cadets should be discontinued and that they should be brought back to Canada, with a view to demobilisation and return to their homes.Timber Purchase. With regard, to the purchase of Dominion timber by the British Government (vide P^eport No. 96), the Dominion Government have tele-graphed that a credit of fifty million dollars has been authorised. Advances up to this amount will therefore be made for the period ending April 1st, 1921, at such time as the British Government may request, and these wall be repayable at Ottawa on January 1st, 1922, and bear interest at 5-J- per cent, per annum, payable half-yearly. The British Government will have the privilege of repaying the principle amount in whole or part at any time, but it is stipulated that the credit shall not be drawn upon unless the exchange should be unfavourable to the United Kingdom when the payments for the purchase of timber become due.AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH.Work in France.-The Australian Press publishes an unofficial report from General Sir John Monash of the Australians&apos; work in France from March 26th last to October 5th. The report sets out the main achievements of the Australians. It is stated that they took 28,655 prisoners, 332 guns, many thousand machine guns, mortars and vehicles ; millions of rounds of ammunition, and also recaptured 116 towns and villages, apart from many fortified farms, mills and woods, releasing 251 square miles of French soil.Conference of Premiers. With the approval of the State Governments, the acting Prime Minister (Mr. Watt) has convened a conference of the Premiers and Treasurers and Ministers of Works for January 22nd, chiefly for the purpose of considering how far the respective public works policies fit in with repatriation requirements.
: Customs Revenue.-The Federal Customs Revenue for the last six mouths amounts to more;than 8 millions, and shows an; increase of 1,408,6741. over the corresponding periodof lastyear.   TLePdstal Revenue-isT3i076,960Zi, an increase- of 320,17!/. : - &apos;r :.:NEW ZEALAND. \Arrival of Prime Minister and Sir Joseph Ward. A telegram has been received-from the Prime Minister (Mr. Massey) and Sir Joseph Ward, dated January 5th, stating that they expect to arrive in England on January 18th.SOUTH AFRICA.Nationalists and Independence: Position of British Government. The South African Nationalists have been informed by Lord Buxton, the Governor-General, that their resolution in favour of sending delegations to Europe with a view to securing the independence of South Africa was laid before His Majesty the King who referred it to his advisers, but was not pleased to give any direction regarding it. The Secretary of State for the Colonies, when communicating this information, explained that the reply of. the Imperial Government last April to the manifesto issued by the Transvaal Nationalists applies in this instance, namely, that under the South African Constitution, the Government and Parliament of the Union can alone be regarded by His Majesty&apos;s Government as authorised to speak on behalf of the people of South Africa. His Majesty&apos;s Government cannot therefore undertake to enter into discussion with any private body or persons./ Coloured Men and Political Rights: Resolution for Peace Conference.-Tim agitation for the removal of the colour bar from the Union Constitution has found strong support from coloured people and others in a series of meetings held in the Cape Peninsula under the auspices of the African Political Organisation. This body has been working on similar lines to the South African Native Congress, which on December 21st last adopted an address to His Majesty King George on the subject (vide Report No. 100). The Peninsula campaign terminated at Cape Town on December 28th, when a resolution was adopted for transmission to the Peace Conference urging that in the event of the concpaered German territories being handed over to Great Britain, no part of them should be incorporated in, or be placed under the control of, the Union until the political disabilities of the coloured people of the Union had been removed. The resolution further emphasised that no rights or privileges in the concpiered territories should be withheld from any section of His Majesty&apos;s subjects on account of colour, race, or creed.Labour and Russian Expedition. The South African Trades Union Congress adopted on December 18th, by 32 votes to 14, a motion in favour of the withdrawal of Allied troops from Russia.Land Settlement: Sir P. FitzPatrick&apos;s Mission. Sir Percy FitzPatrick sailed on December 31st for England on a mission, connected with the promotion of land settlement in South Africa. In the course of an interview with ReuteFs representative Sir Percy emphasised the fact that he had been working at express speed for four years against the time when the soldiers should be leaving the battlefields and making for the land, and that thus the framework of land settlement had been in process of erection. He said that what had. been accomplished on the Sunday River settlements was only a small beginning because South Africa, with its certainty of continued low taxation for land, and the possibility of getting selected areas direct from the owners, afforded perfect suitability for European settlement and an ideal home for settlers. A great factor, he added, was the abundance of good native labour. Thus a man who was able to work and. was willing to learn and with sufficient capital to own a small farm had excellent prospects. Sir Percy FitzPatrick explained that he was especially desirous of finding settlers for fruit-growing, including citrous fruits, as well as for dairying and sheep and cattle farming, and pigs and poultry farming.Wool Clip. The Union Government telegraphing to the British Government on January 3rd, stated the belief that up to that time there appeared to be little . likelihood of 150,000 bales of wool being registered for sale.
INDIA.(Excluding External Affairs, which are dealt with in the Eastern Report.)National Congress. The National Congress opened at Delhi on December 26th, when the Moderates for the most part abstained from attendance. According to various reports cabled to the Press it appears that the Pandit Malaviya, who is a member of the Viceregal Council, in his presidential address offered loyal and dutiful greetings to His Majesty upon the successful termination of the war. Indians, he said, were particularly glad to think that while despotic monarchs were disappearing, the King-Emperor sat even more firmly in the affections of the people. He suggested a Congress message should be sent to &apos; the Peace Conference to the effect that India was prepared to contribute in every way possible towards its success and to support the idea of the League of Nations.: He thought that India&apos;s representation at the Conference, should be more numerous. He said Sir S. P. Sinha represented the Government and not the Indian public. The Governments views might or might not be those of the people, but the Government might have consulted the Congress and the Moslem League or the elected members of the Legislative Council in regard to the appointment.Discussing self determination, he said that what they asked for Was the measure of self-government adopted by the Congress and the League in 1916. The proposals of Mr. Montagu and Lord Chelmsford fell far short of the scheme, and were inadequate. It was for them, to decide whether, in view of events that had taken place since the special Congress, they would let its decisions stand.. In view of the grave and momentous issues involved, he would reconsider them and welcome any suggestions for improvement. The Pandit asked that the measure of self-government to be given them should be judged in the light of the principle of. self-determination which had emerged triumphant out of the devastating war. In order that that should be done it was not necessary that the proposals of reform which had been elaborated by Mr. Montagu and Lord Chelmsford should be laid aside and a brand new scheme prepared. Let the Government give effect to the principle of self-determination in India by embodying it in a preamble to the reform statute and providing that the representatives of the people should have an effective voice in determining the future steps of progress towards complete responsible government. This would produce contentment and gratitude, and strengthen attachment to the British Empire.Referring to the Rowlatt report, he said that the Committee themselves stated that all the plots had been successfully encountered with the support of Indian loyalty. This should be enough to silence the calumniators of India. Let not the misdeeds of a small number of misguided youths be pitted against the unswerving loyalty.of Indians millions. It was not repression but liberal reforms that would provide a remedy for conspiracies.At the second day&apos;s meeting of the National Congress the proceedings were brief, and the Congress adjourned after passing a resolution of loyalty to the Throne and appreciation of the gallantry of the Allied forces, and of the achievements of the Indian troops. It also reaffirmed the resolution of the special Congress demanding self-government, a declaration of rights, and commissions in the Army for Indians.There was an interesting development when the President announced that he had received amendments to the resolution on the agenda stating that full responsible government should be granted to the provinces at once, that non-official Europeans should not be allowed a separate electorate on the ground of representing the mining or tea industries, and that, if given representation, it should be limited to their pro-portion to population. The Pandit Malaviya, after consultation with his friends, decided that this resolution should be sent back to the Subjects Committee for reconsideration.At the meeting of the Congress on December 29th it was suggested that Mr. Tilak should be nominated as delegate to the Peace Conference to claim the right of self-determination for India, and full provincial autonomy. The sitting was fully occupied with a discussion of the latter subject. *Mr. Sastri moved an amendment to &quot;delete the words &quot;disappointing and unsatisfactory&quot; in respect of the Reforms Report. He objected to full provincial autonomy. Mr. Sastri claimed a diarchy government for India; and demanded fiscal autonomy.   Mr. SastrFs amendment was directed also against the proposal, for fixing&quot;185-2a B
a period of 15 years for the full conferment of responsible-government upon India. He warned the Congress that the resolution took them into daugerous waters, and emphasised the fact that the time limit was to be fixed by Parliament. He doubted whether anyone would be able to convince Parliament that within a certain period, no matter what happened, definite forward steps should be taken. Mrs. Besant approved the words &quot; disappointing and unsatisfactory,&quot; but urged that disunion would lead to annihilation separately by &quot;the enemy.&quot; She stated she would rather wait for responsible government than part with those who. helped them at the Bombay Congress. The President-elect of the Moslem League said that after what he saw at the Calcutta riots, the bureaucracy must go at once: He objected to a diarchy, and moved an amendment (which was negatived) urging the grant of full autonomy or nothing. Mr. Sastrfs proposal to amend the resolution was rejected by a large majority.A motion in favour of full provincial autonomy, and against special European electorates, was carried by acclamation.A resolution on the agenda of the Congress protests against the alleged attempt to place the Punjab in an inferior position in the Reforms Scheme.Indians in South Africa. The Cape British Indian Council has sent a message to the Indian National Congress at Delhi conveying its heartfelt congratulations to India on the noble part it has played in bringing the&apos; world war to a successful conclusion, and also requesting the Congress to insist on the granting of full responsible Government to India and full British citizenship to Indians in South Africa.GERMAN COLONIES IN AFRICA.German Labour and Colonial Policy. In connection with an extract from a memorandum on &quot; German Colonies,&quot; appearing in Report No. 96, a translation of an article entitled &quot; Colonial Policy and Labour,&quot; appearing in the weekly organ of the Social-Democrat Party, Die Neue Zeit, for &quot;November 22nd, has been prepared by the Political Intelligence Department of the Foreign Office. In the course of this article the following passage occurs :  &apos;&quot; One of the most difficult tasks which will confront our negotiators at the Conference table will be to obtain from England and France the return of the German African Colonies. True, AVilsohs peace programme does not contain any demand to the effect that German colonial dominions are to pass into English hands. Nevertheless it is certain that the British Government will resist to the utmost anv suggestions that it should give up German East Africa and South-West Africa. The propaganda campaign against alleged German atrocities in the colonies has been got up by England for no other purpose than that of giving her pretensions to German colonial territory a kind of moral justification.&quot; The attitude of the German working class to the colonial question had changed more and more, even in the last years preceding the world-war. Under the influence of war experiences and of the English efforts to unite Great Britain Avith its colonies in one economic league, and to make it harder for German industries, even when the war is over, to procure raw materials from overseas, this change has proceeded further. That the Social-Democrat Party formerly took up to the colonial question an attitude essentially different from its present one is quite understandable in view of the differences in the political and industrial situation then and to-day.&quot;The article proceeds to point out that the absence of ardour for Colonial policy that existed in the past was due, in a certain measure, to the red tape and bureau-cratic methods adopted in relation to the Colonies, to the abominations committed by people like Leist, Wehlau, and Arenberg, and to the fact that the internal conditions of Germany were not of a kind to direct men&apos;s eyes to distant countries, the task of settling men on the land at home being of more immediate concern.
It is, however, pointed out that various alterations have taken place in the conduct of Colonial arrangements such as the improvement of the sanitary service,^ the advance of German science in the direction of ethnological and geographical research, scientific exploration and educational work.Finally, the economic side of the question is dealt with in the following-passage : &quot;In our case what we have to determine is whether the balance of-national economy would be disturbed, if those particular industries which depend exclusively or mainly upon tropical raw materials were eliminated or prevented from working to their full capacity. Such dependence upon colonial products exists in the case of many of. our most important branches of industry. Now supposing we could have security that the market for colonial raw materials would in future be open to all countries on equal terms, that the Mother Country xoould be given no preferential advantage over other countries, we might perhaps waive our demand to have firm possession of the German Colonies. But where are such conditions offered ? And in this connection it is by no means always simply a question of a customs tariff giving a preference to the Mother Country. The industries of foreign countries can always be put at a disadvantage, as against those of the Mother Country, by the introduction of particular harbour and warehouse privileges, special facilities for export and transport, direct or indirect support of private rings and associations for the produc-tion or purchase of raw materials. It is therefore certainly untrue to say that Germany&apos;s industrial population has no interest in Germany&apos;s possession of colonies. Just because they have an interest in home industries remaining able to compete and expand, it is their interest to see that it is not made more difficult for these industries to procure colonial raw materials than it is for other countries.&quot; The absolutely negative attitude which the Social-Democrat Party at one time took up towards the colonial question is thus no longer justified.&quot;The article terminates with the declaration, &quot; In the new democratic Germany it will be the task of social democracy to shape colonial policy more and more in stick, a way as to make it truly serve the cause of civilisation.&quot;
