BRITISH  EMPIRE  AND  AFRICA  REPORT.IMPERIAL AFFAIRS.Imperial Statistical Conference. The Dominion Governments have been informed that with reference to Resolution VIII, of the Imperial War Conference, 1918; His Majesty&apos;s Government will be glad to make arrangements for the Imperial Statistical Conference at a date generally convenient, and preparations are in hand for the circulation of memoranda bearing on the wort.It is added that the earliest possible date for the Conference seems to be November 1919, but it is thought that this may be inconvenient owing to pressure of work on the principal Statistical Officers in connection with demobilisation and reconstruction work. In that event one of the early months of 1920 maybe preferred. The Dominion Governments are asked to telegraph as to the date thought most suitable for Dominion representatives.SELF-GOVERNING   DOMINIONS.CANADA.Peace Day. Peace Day was celebrated by a general holiday in the Dominion. Amongst the measures taken were the firing of a salute from 21 guns, processions of marching veterans, band concerts in the public places, and addresses on what Peace means, together with a full clay of sporting events.As Acting-Premier while Sir Robert Borden is away on vacation, Sir George Foster issued a Peace Manifesto, in the course of which it was stated : &quot; As Canadians we are devoutly thankful that no enemy force has profaned our soil, and that we have been spared the horrors of,, war within our territory. If by unselfish sacrifice and service the war was won, surely, by the same paths, we, as a people, must approach and perform our task of community and nation building.&quot;Overseas Forces and the Peace Procession. The Headquarters of the Dominion Overseas Military Forces- in London issued the following statement with reference to the Peace Celebration Procession :  &quot; It is a matter of deep regret that it has been found impossible to accept tbe invitation extended by the War Office to the Canadian Forces to take part in the Peace Celebration Procession in London.&quot; Owing to the success of the Canadian scheme of demobilisation all organised units have already been repatriated. Some Canadian soldiers still remain in this country, but wffiile they individually represent a number of fighting units, the circumstances of departure prevent their being given a.ceremonial formation.&quot;A Canadian contingent from Witley Camp was, however, eventually represented in the procession, and comprised men from various branches of the service including Artillery, Infantry, Engineers and the Canadian Army Service Corps.There has been some criticism in the Canadian Press regarding the arrangements for the rjarticipation of Canada in the Peace Procession.Prime Minister and Cabinet Reconstruction. The Prime Minister (Sir Robert Borden) accompanied by Sir Henry Drayton, Chief of the Railway Commission, is taking a holiday on the Lower St. Lawrence. There is a rumour that Sir Henry Drayton will be the new Minister of Finance, and another report is that the Premier of Quebec (Sir Lomer Gouin) will meet the Prime Minister, and arrangements will be made for him to enter the Cabinet.Grain Growers and Liberals. At a recent meeting of the grain growers of Manitoba great enthusiasm was shown for independent political action, especially as
AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH.Peace Day. In the course of the Peace Celebrations throughout the Common-wealth it is announced in the Press that the Governor-General at a Lord Mayors&apos; dinner at Sydney warned the people that the Covenant of the League of Nations did not give complete security, and therefore the obligation of national defence still rested with the nation. A speech was made by Sir Edmund Barton, who as Father of the Federation, implored all sections to cast out the devil of discord which was active in Australia.   &quot; Of the problems of peace,&quot; he said, &quot; the first is the restoration ofS426-4a A 2regards the coming Liberal Convention. The party pledged itself to support the farmers&apos; platform.Calgary and &quot; One Big Union.&quot; The officers elected by the Calgary Trades and Labour Council are, according to Press announcements, strongly opposed to the &quot; One Big Union&quot; movement. Mr. R, A. Rigg, Western Organiser of the Dominion Trades Congress, who is reorganising the Winnipeg Trades and Labour Council, has declared: &quot;I am satisfied that it will be a strong Council, and-able to hold its own in the field of organised labour. The principles of internationalism have a firm hold on the bulk of labour men, and there is no doubt in my mind as to the ultimate triumph of the international organisation.&quot;Failure of Crops in the West. The drought in Southern Alberta and in parts of Saskatchewan has seriously affected the crops. Mr. J. H. Wood, President of the United Farmers of Alberta, declares that the present situation is nothing short of calamitous. He adds that the optimistic reports that have been sent out in an attempt to buoy up the spirits of the people have brought about serious conditions. Remedies, he says, must be found quickly, for the crop is an absolute failure, and in many districts the farmers have deserted their holdings and gone to work in more fortunate districts.Soldiers and the Land: Choice of Employment. Of the 273,000 members of the Canadian Army who filled in the demobilisation questionnaires, issued by the Department of Soldiers&apos; Civil Re-establishment, 87,000 desired to make agriculture or stock-raising tkeir future avocation. Of this number. 72,000 were previously engaged in tkese pursuits,Wkile 4,000 who were previously employed on the land expressed a wish to enter new occupations, over 20,000 intended to desert other occupations and settle on the land.. The total desertions from professional and general occupations were recorded as 12,000, while the accessions under this head amounted to 21,000.The questionnaires indicate that one out of every five soldiers desires to change his occupation on returning to civil life.The Report of the Soldiers&apos; Settlement Board up to June 24th shows that the total loans issued to returned men now aggregate S 14,467,974.Soldiers&apos; Education. Financial assistance for those soldiers who, having served overseas, desire to continue their education and prove their capability of doing so, has been asked of the Government by the Universities of the Dominion, a notable Committee of which met at Toronto under the presidency of Mr. R. A. Falconer, President of the University of Toronto.The Committee stated that the memorial sent to Sir Robert Borden was as follows : &apos;: Canada must not lag behind Great Britain, and Australia, in this matter. Our proposal is that the Government should grant every returned soldier, who can prove his need and capability, maintenance and fees for at least one year. The sum of $350 would he required for subsistence, and at the highest, the fees should not average more than $150.&quot; In view of the fact that there are now at least 1,000 returned soldiers in Higher Education institutions throughout Canada, and that the same number are undergoing instruction at the Khaki University or in British Universities, it is probable that at least 3,000 men will seek education next winter in our Canadian institutions. The amount necessary to carry out the scheme is estimated at $1,500,000.&apos;*&apos; The machinery for putting the scheme into operation need not be elaborate, as. the Government could deal direct with the Universities.&quot;
harmony between man ancl man. To both sides in Australia my cry is &apos; Leave off denouncing each other.   Let each look to its own faults.&apos; &quot;Riots in Melbourne. According to cables to the Press riots took place in Melbourne-on July 21st, It is stated that nearly 8,000 repatriated soldiers, together with a mob of hooligans, sought an interview with Air. Lawson, the Premier, in&quot;order to submit their grievances. Mr. Lawson at the time was in the public offices. The mob swarmed into the offices, but mounted police charged ancl dispersed them. Later 5,000 collected in Russell Street with the object of releasing soldiers in gaol, and wild scenes ensued.Seamen&apos;s Strike (vide also Report No. 128). The position of the seamen s strike was reported on July 15th to be still serious. Endeavours were being made to foster a general strike throughout the Commonwealth in sympathy with the seamen. The feeling in union circles in Sydney was that a general strike would not be declared in New South Wales. The Secretary of the Coal Miners&apos; Federation personally thought&quot; the miners would be acting unwisely in ceasing work. The Secretary of the Seamen&apos;s Union said the men would not resume work until they were granted their claim for a six hours&apos; clay in port, an increase in wages and overtime, and compensa-tion for injury or death arising out of their employment. The Federal Government have instituted proceedings in the Arbitration Court against the Seamen&apos;s Union in connection with the strike. Endeavours are being made to man ships by volunteer labour. There is much distress prevailing- through unemployment resulting from the strike.The President of the Seamen&apos;s Union, addressing a meeting last week, is reported to have said that he hoped he would be deported so that he would be able to start a maritime strike in England.Shipment of Copra. The British Government having asked the Commonwealth Government for the reasons why the United States barque Aurora, which proceeded to Sydney early in June to load copra for a Pacific port, has been detained owing to an export license not being issued, a telegram has been received from the Australian Government stating that applicants for shipments of copra by the Aurora were informed that as copra was required to meet local necessities applications could not be approved. It is further explained that the Commonwealth Government have refused permits to export copra from late German New Guinea, except to Australia ancl in British ships, pending the issue of the Mandate, the reason being that copra is needed for Australian requirements. It is added that applications have recently been received for permission to tranship in Australia for America copra from the Dutch East Indies, and on the understanding that copra is for transhipment to America and not for local consumption in Australia, permission for such transhipment has been given.It is considered by the Commonwealth Government that the effort of the Japanese to capture the trade can for the present be frustrated if copra from the Pacific Islands can be confined to Australian ancl English channels.NEW ZEALAND.Labour Party and Peace Treaty.-Regarding the manifesto issued by the New Zealand Labour Party condemning the Peace Treaty (vide Report No. 128) the terms of the manifesto have now been cabled to the Press, from which it appears that the Peace Treaty is condemned in unqualified terms as not representing the voice of the peoples, as tending to war ancl not to peace, and as violating almost all the Fourteen Points. &quot; It is impossible,&quot; it says, &quot;to make the world safe for humanity while capitalism, with its adjuncts, Imperialism and militarism, remain.&quot;The Dominion says : &quot; Contemptible in other respects, the manifesto is valuable as a further revelation of the sympathies and outlook of the Labour Party.&apos;&apos;Addressing the Labour Party Conference, Mr. Paul,.member of the Legislative Council and President of the Conference, said Labour had a great opportunity, which might not-recur in the delegates&apos;lifetime.SOUTH AFRICA. ...South African Party and Nationalists. The Union Minister of Railways and Harbours (Mr. Burton), in referring recently to the efforts being made to effect a
rapprochement between the Nationalists and the South African Party, declared that before this was possible the clearest undertaking must be expressed that the Eepubbcan programme would be definitely abandoned, and that the Union Constitution and the British flag would be fully accepted as the basis of the State. Upon this vital and cardinal point, he said, there could be no compromise, neither could there be any underhand arrangements or undertakings that left the Republican project temporarily shelved for the pobtical purposes of the day. That was the deliberate attitude of the Government and the South African Party as at present constituted.The reference of the Minister of Railways to the efforts that were being made in the Union to effect a rapprochement between the Nationalists and the South African Party has provoked a good deal of discussion. The Cape members of the two parties have held an unofficial conference at Somerst East to discuss the matter, and this is regarded in some quarters as a step towards co-operation, but whereas in the Cape Province the Ministerialists oppose tbe project on similar grounds to those put forward by Mr. Burton, viz., that for the fusion to be possible the Republican programme would have to be definitely abandoned and the Union Constitution and the British flag fuUy accepted as the basis of the State, the Nationalist leaders in the Transvaal are opposed to any reunion that is not based on independence.The Volkstem, the organ of the Pretoria Government, criticises Mr. Burton, and asks &quot; Cannot he join us in rejoicing over those points which appeal to both parties ? &quot;It is announced in the Press that the Somerset East Conference was not attended by any responsible members of the South African Party, and the NationaHsts were in a large majority. The basis of reunion proposed at the Conference carefully avoided any allusion to Repubhcanism or any other of the fundamental questions which now divide the two parties. In the Transvaal Mr. Tiehnan Roos, Chairman of the Nationalists, has, expressly declared that there can be no reunion unless the South African Partj7 accept the principle of Republicanism.British Indians in the Union.-It is announced in Johannesburg that an Indian Congress, which will include delegates from all the provinces, will open on August 3rd. The notice convening the Congress says that the community as a whole stands on the brink of final destruction unless concerted action is immediately taken. In the meantime the Indians are signing a solemn league and covenant agreeing to abstain from complying with or conforming to the civil laws of the Union of South Africa as long as any law imposing any class distinction or disability upon British Indians remains on the Statute book and pledging themselves to suffer every consequence-which such disobedience of the civil laws may entail.
