The grant of titles to Canadians is again&apos; to be raised, and the proposal is now still more drastic.The Census of Manufactures has disclosed some interesting facts as to the influence of the war upon industrial activity.The figures relating to advances byway of credits to the United Kingdom are instructive.- Australian Commonwealth.The Resolutions that continue to be passed in the Commonwealth (outside strictly Official Labour circles) indicate a strong opinion in favour of Mr. Hughes&apos; attitude regarding indemnities and the Pacific Islands.The naval gift is apparently creating much satisfaction and will be treated as a generous tribute to the work of the Australian Navy in the war.The influenza epidemic shows signs of abatement.South Africa.Before making the offer to convey the Nationalist delegates on H.M.S. Minerva, the Admiral obtained the full approval of the Acting Prime Minister and the Governor-General.. The warning of one of the Natal members as to the possibility of his Province desiring to secede from the Union if the RepubHcan movement, should continue, cannot be wholly disregarded.The natives of the Free State Province are naturally opposed to Republicanism.The Union Epidemic Commission have made an interesting suggestion as to the establishment of an International Bureau.The Budget Statement has illustrated the improvement in the trade of the &quot;Union. [p,t.o.
India.(Excluding External Affairs.). The Indian opposition to the legislation on the Sedition Committee Report has been made apparent in the Council.

BRITISH  EMPIRE   AND   AFRICA  REPORT.IMPERIAL AFFAIRS.Dominion Universities and Service - Men&apos;s Studies. The Governments of the Dominion of Canada and the Commonwealth of Australia have been informed that the British Board of Education are furnishing financial help up to an annual maximum of llhl. to enable suitable service men to carry out University studies.It is believed that some of the above, for various reasons, including perhaps eventual settlement, may wish to complete their studies at Dominion Universities or Technical or Agricultural Colleges. It is pointed, out that the Board of Education would extend financial support to such cases provided the Universities and Colleges in the Dominions favoured the idea. Enquiries are therefore being addressed to the Chancellors of the over-sea Universities as to any concessions they are prepared to make regarding entrance, examination, fees, and residence.SELF-GOVERNING  DOMINIONS.CANADA.Opening of Parliament: Speech from the Throne. Parliament was opened, on February 20th by the Governor-General. After the Speech from the Throne had been read in both languages, the House of. Commons adjourned until February 25th as a mark of respect to the memory of Sir Wilfrid Laurier.In the Speech from the Throne, references were made to forthcoming legislation, which, contrary to anticipation, included a Bill conferring on women the right to sit as members of Parliament. Other legislation foreshadowed in the Speech included the following subjects, viz., construction of highways, assistance to enable returned men to settle on the land, the promotion of desirable immigration, vocational training, better housing, creation of a Department of Public Health, the validation of Orders-in-Council respecting pensions and prohibition, a new Elections Act, and the establishment of credits for the purchase of the cOuntry&apos;s products by the Allies.As to Imperial relationship and the League of Nations, the following observations occurred in the Speech : -&quot;The deeply loyal and earnest co-operation of the Overseas Dominions and Dependencies with the Mother Country must more firmly cement for all time those ties which bind the Empire in an indissoluble union.&quot; The spirit born of common sacrifice, suffering and heroic endeavour will permanently unite the Allies by the bonds of a great memory and tradition, and will effectually promote the formation of a League of Nations which will ensure for all time the peace of the.world.&quot;Motions in Parliament: Titles, Divorce, Returned Soldiers, &amp;c. Many notices of motion Inrve been placed on the order paper of the House of Commons.Mr. W. F. Nickle, M.P. for Kingston, Out., intends to again bring up the question of titles, which produced a notable debate last session. He has given notice of motion on the Adclrsss to the effect that &quot; Your Majesty may be graciously pleased to refrain from conferring any titles upon srdrjects domiciled or living in Canada, it being understood that this humble prayer has no reference to professional or vocational
appellations conferred in respect of commissions issued by Your Majesty on persons in the Military or Naval Services of Canada, or persons engaged in the administration of justice in the Dominion.&quot;The same member has a motion down that a committee inquire into the divorce procedure in the Dominion.Mr. H. M. Mowatt, M.P. for Parkdale, Toronto, has given notice of a resolution asking the Government to erect a village in the neighbourhood of a city in each Province, to afford residences and workshops where returned soldiers may engage in the production of goods not hitherto made in Canada, as well as objects of art and literature, so as to afford a permanent source of means for these men, in addition to their pensions.Sir Sam Hughes is asking for a Select Committee of the House to inquire into the circumstances surrounding the raid by the military authorities on the Guelph Novitiate, and the former Minister of Militia also has a motion on the paper calling for a uniform administration of the law respecting deserters.The Minister of Railways has given notice of a resolution to provide an annual appropriation of $200,000 for a term of 10 years to aid in construction work for the protection of the public at highway crossings.Leadership of the Opposition. Pending the calling together of the National Convention which will choose the official Leader of the Liberal Party, the Liberal caucus held on February 24th selected Mr. 1). D. Mackenzie, K.C., to lead the Opposition in the House of Commons as a temporary measure. It is announced that Mr. Mackenzie will act with an Advisory Committee of Management, of which the Chief Opposition Whip (Air. Robb) will be chairman. Air. Mackenzie was born in 1859, and is a Barrister and Attorney-at-Law. He was Mayor of North Sydney for five consecutive years and Judge of a County Court District in Nova Scotia from 1906 to 1908, when he resigned. He was first elected to the Dominion House of Commons in 1904 and was re-elected at the elections of 1908 and 1911. He represents Cape Breton North in the House of Commons.Work for Aliens. Aliens in the cities of Eastern Canada are to be. sent to the West by the Government, according to a statement made by Dr. W. A. Riddelf to a deputation which  waited on him. He stated that the Government were working out a plan by which all enemy aliens would be employed on work allotted by the Government and paid such wages as the Federal authorities decided. Officials would be appointed to look after the aliens. These foreigners would principally be employed in clearing work, and building highways and railways. Some had already^ been despatched to the West.Industrial Activity. A considerable growth in Canadian industrial activity is disclosed in the Census of Manufactures recently completed by the Dominion Bureau of Statistics. The returns cover 34,380 establishments and compare wdth &quot;the census of 1915 as follows : Capital invested (1917) approximately $2,773,000,000, as against $1,941,000,000 in 1915 ; the total number of employees in 1917 is given as upwards of 693,000, as compared with less than 515,000 in 1915 ; while the amounts paid out in salaries and wages have almost doubled. The gross value of goods produced in 1917 reached more than $3,000,000,000 as compared with $1,407,000 two years previously. The flour milling industry reached the head of the list in the matter of production, the gross value of products being given as $224,000,000, and the steel industry, meat packing, lumbering, munitions, pulp and paper, followed in the order named.Trade Returns for January. The Dominion Minister of Immigration and Colonisation reports that in view of the anticipated slowing down of business in the Dominion following the cessation of the manufacture of munitions and the lighter buying of foodstuffs on account of the Allies, the Canadian trade returns for the month of January show surprisingly good results. Exports and imports and the favourable trade balance all stood at the highest level ever reported in a January statement. In addition, the total exports, amounting to upwards of $116,000,000,. represent a gain over the month of December of some $9,000,000, while imports are also higher at a total of nearly $74,000,000. The balance of exports over imports in January was $42,600,000, an increase over the same month last year of $8,500,000.
Credit Advances. The Dominion Minister of Finance announces that Treasury Bills aggregating $175,000,000 negotiated with Canadian Banks have been paid off in full Tut of the proceeds of the last &quot; Victory &quot; Loan. Taking into account these Bills, the following sums have been advanced by way of credits to the Government of the United Kingdom for the purposes named below : $To the Imperial Munitions Board, Ottawa, for tnuni-tions, ships, aeroplanes and timber, since June last 132,000,000 To purchase Canadian wheat and other cereals - 55,000,000 To purchase dairy products  - - - -    35,000,000To purchase British Columbia salmon pack -      8,000,000For other foodstuffs   -. - - -     10,000,000AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH.Resolutions on Indemnities and Pacific Islands.   The Australian Natives Association Directors at their quarterly meeting at Melbourne passed a resolution congratulating Mr. Hughes on his work in Paris, particularly regarding the main-tenance of a white Australia, and safeguarding Australian interests in the South Pacific, and as regards an indemnity for the costs of the war.The Executive of the Corio Branch of the National Federation Association has passed a resolution of admiration for Mr. Hughes&apos; highly capable representation of Australia at the Peace Conference, whole-heartedly approving his attitude regarding indemnities and the retention of the Pacific Islands, expressing every confidence in the success and reward of his splendid fight and hoping that his health will enable him to return and receive the thanks of the grateful people of the Commonwealth.British Naval Gift. With regard to the Aclmiralty&apos;s offer to the Commonwealth of a flotilla of six destroyers and six submarines, ReuteFs Australian correspondent telegraphs that the Australian Navy Department highly appreciates the Imperial Governments magnificent gift of the flotilla, worth 2,000,000Z. This, it is observed, will enable Australia to concentrate on the construction of cruisers, and it is felt, moreover, that the gift should prove an inducement to young Australians to enlist in the Navy.Release of Interned Persons. The Federal Cabinet have decided to appoint a committee to deal with applications for release by persons now interned in Australia.The Influenza Epidemic. Owing to the influenza epidemic the Government, of Western Australia recently stopped trans-continental trains at the border, and the Commonwealth Government therefore cancelled all trains to Western Australia. The Western Australian Government then pleaded for a restoration of traffic. The Government of Queensland are seeking a High Court injunction to prevent the Commonwealth landing troops in the Northern State.New South Wales prohibited inter-State traffic owing to the intensity of the disease. Victoria, by its policy of landing troops from other States, became a centre of infection. Severe restrictions continue, the closing of schools, churches, theatres, and hotel bars being made compulsory. The wearing of masks and inoculation are also obligatory.Many persons have been fined, in Sydney for not wearing influenza masks. Dr. Fox, a Sydney physician, who refused to wear an anti-influenza mash, and who was committed for trial for disobeying the regulation, has declined to accept bail and has been sent to prison.South Australia has been declared an infected State.The Labour Party&apos;s suggestions for combating influenza include the mobilisation of doctors.The latest reports indicate an improvement regarding the spread of the epidemic.Defence Minister in South Africa. The Australian Minister of Defence (Senator Pearce), who is on his way to England in connection with the demobilisation of Australian soldiers, arrived at Durban on February 18th. He is proceeding overland via Johannesburg and Pretoria to Cape Town, where he will rejoin his ship and continue his journey to London.
SOUTH AFRICA.Nationalist Delegation. With reference to the offer to the Nationalist delegates of a passage on II.M.S. Minerva, the Governor-General has informed the Secretary of State for the Colonies that the idea of making this offer occurred spontaneously to the Admiral, who had heard on February 15th that the ship was ordered home. Before taking action, however, the Admiral consulted the Governor-General, and the offer was made to General Hertzog with the full approval and knowledge both of the Acting Prime Minister and of the Governor-General.It is announced in the Press that the Nationalists, on finding that they could not sail by the Durham Castle, made all efforts to secure passages on non-British ships.Speaking in the House of Assembly on February 17th, the Acting Premier (Mr. Malan) stated that he had got into touch with the Portuguese Consul-General and found that the Portuguese steamer Africa was expected at Cape Town on March 5th. The Consul-General had agreed that if the Union Government requested them to take the Nationalist Delegation they would make a special effort to do so.Republicanism: Debate in House of Assembly. The Debate, in the House of Assembly on Republican propaganda was continued on February 17th. The Minister of the Interior (Sir Thomas Watt) denied Nationalist allegations to the effect that the Government wished to flood South Africa with hundreds of thousands of tuberculous ex-soldiers and sailors, and he also denied that the Union Government had received any orders from the Imperial Government with reference to its attitude towards enemy subjects. Sir T. Watt claimed that English-speaking inhabitants had made good their footing in South Africa by co-operation with the Dutch-speaking inhabitants in the native wars, and he declared it would be impossible for any League of Nations to treat South Africa more considerately and sympathetically than Great Britain had done.Mr. C. P. Robinson, Member for Durban (Umbilo), expressed a serious fear lest a movement to secede from the Union should arise in Natal as a result of the Republican agitation. Mr. Fichardt, the Nationalist Member for Ladybrand, admitted that while the Nationalists w^ere not pro-German they were anti-British, but he maintained that circumstances had forced them to be anti-British.The Minister of Lands (Colonel Mentz), speaking as an ex-Transvaal Republican, declared that as long as Great Britain kept faith he would keep his word given at Vereeniging. They must show, he said, that they intended honourably to stand by the pledges given at the time of the Union.The debate was again adjourned.Opposition to the Republican Movement. The citizens of Cape Town on February 18th held the first of what will be a series of meetings of protest throughout the -country regarding the Republican movement. This meeting passed an emphatic resolution condemning the agitation for the disruption of the Union and the severance of the connection with Great Britain. The Union Minister of Railways and Harbours (Mr. Burton) was the principal speaker, and referred to the Nationalist Mission to England as &quot; a foolish, childish, and mad enterprise.&quot; Sir Frederick de Waal, the Administrator of the Cape Province, emphasised that the loyal Dutch were in determined accord with the British element in maintaining the Union.7378-4abTroubles in Naval Shipbuilding. The Government decided to stop work in the naval dockyard at Cockatoo Island, Sydney, owing to the deliberate go-slow policy of -a section of the men. By this breach of an agreement guaranteeing continuity of piecework the output was so seriously diminished as to make the work unprofitable. The boilermakers had reduced the riveting rate from 295 to 73 per day per man, but the latest messages show that they have resumed work after guaranteeing unrestricted output.NEW ZEALAND.Dominion Press and Pacific Islands. According to a Renter message the New Zealand Press is divided on the subject of the decision of the Peace Conference with regard to the Pacific Islands, though the weight of newspaper opinion favours the acceptance of the decision as a reasonable compromise in a difficult situation.
Natives and the Republican Movement. The Native Congress of the Oranoe Tree State Province has passed a; resolution that the movement to change the Province into a Republic would, if successful, prove a serious menace to the Avell-being of the coloured races in it. The Resolution asserted that until the ruling whites showed a disposition to govern the natives more human eh&apos;-, all such secessionist movements must be stoutly resisted by the native population. The Congress further enthusiastically passed a resolution of loyalty and congratulations to the King and the Union Government on the victory of the British arms and the triumph of the Allied cause.Epidemic Commission. The Union Epidemic Commission, after widespread investigations, has submitted numerous recommendations as to how best to combat future epidemics in South Africa. The recommendations aim at the institution of a highly efficient Public Health Service, under which provision would be made for a semi-military organisation to secure the complete mobilisation and requisition of medical stores throughout the Union in case of emergency. A rigid maritime quarantine as well as the restriction of railway travelling are among the means advocated for the prevention of the introduction and spread of an epidemic. A strong-recommendation is made that the Union should enter immediately into negotiations with the Governments of other countries with a view to establishing and participating in -an international bureau for the collection and dissemination of all data bearing-upon epidemics. ;Budget Statement. In the South African House of Assembly on February 19th the Minister of Finance (Mr. Orr), delivering the Budget statement, said the estimated revenue for the financial year 1918-19 was 21,270,000Z., or an increase of 2,014,000Z, over the original estimate, while -the expenditure was 21,339,000Z., or 1,481,000/. over the original estimate. The increased, revenue included 1,352,0001. increase in Customs returns. The estimated expenditure for 1919-20 was 22,164,000Z., and the revenue 20,629,000Z., leaving a deficit of 1.535,000Z.Mr. Orr proposed an increase in the duties on imported spirits of from 23s. tid. to 30s. per gallon, while the excise on Colonial spirits should, he proposed, be increased by 2s. fid. per gallon. He further suggested an increase in the excise on beers, which would give 375,0001. from increased customs and expise. He further proposed an increase in the export tax on diamonds up to 10 per cent, and the inclusion of alluyials, yielding 420,000Z. If the raising of the duty tended to encourage local diamond cutting he would not quarrel with it. He also intended to apply the excess profits duty, which would yield 600,000Z., to Revenue Account instead of to Loan Account; thus the deficit would be reduced to 140,000Z., at which it would remain. \The Minister gave exhaustive statistics showing the improvement of the Union in the matter of imports and exports, and also the establishment of new industries. The public debt, as at the end of March, would amount to 166,274,000Z. The total amount of local stock issued during the war was 20,9S7,O00Z., and the number of individual holders 10,000. Mr. Orr proposed that Parliament should be asked to empower the issue of War Savings Certificates to enable the small investor to partici-pate in loans. He also announced the amendment of the law dealing with the taxation of farmers&apos; incomes, in respect of which a Commission had recently been carrying on an investigation.Bij-Election at Cape Town. At the by-election at Cape Town for the Union House of Assembly, for the suburban division of Newlands, Mr. Buchanan (Unionist) obtained 1,072 votes and Mr. Lomax (Labour), 712. Mr. Buchanan succeeds Mr. Withinshaw (Unionist), deceased.INDIA.(Excluding External Affairs, which are dealt with in the Eastern Report.)Legislation on Sedition Committee Report.-With reference to the Bills which were introduced in order to give effect to the recommendations of the Sedition Committee (vide Report No. 104), Sir William Vincent announced at a meeting of the-
Imperial Council on February 10th. that the Emergency Powers Bill, which had been referred to a Select Committee on February 7th, should be in operation only for a period of three years after the conclusion of the war.. Sir William Vincent then introduced the other Bill which proposes permanent changes in the regular criminal law. In the discussion which followed a number of Indian members expressed gratification at the decision of the Government in regard to the first Bill, and urged that the second Bill shmdd also be limited in its duration or withdrawn. All the Indian speakers opposed-the new Bill, especially the provision that persons found in possession of seditions documents for an unlawful purpose should be liable to two years&apos; imprisonment. Sir William Vincent declared that the legislation was solely intended to deal with anarchical and revolutionary crimes, and would not be used to interfere with political action. The Bill was ultimately referred to a Select Committee.It is stated in the Press that it is improbable that the extremists will abandon their violent campaign against the Bills, and it is even considered possible that they will be encouraged by what they may regard as the partial surrender of the Government;Some of the Press comments as to the voting on the first Bill emphasise that if the Reforms had been in operation the Government would have been in a minority on the measure affecting peace and good order.Bombay Strikes. It w^as reported on February 14th that the labour troubles in Bombay had subsided, and that though strikes at individual mills occurred frequently, the great majority of the mills were working steadily. A recrudescence of the strikes is stated to be probable when the operatives realise that they will receive no pay for the strike period, as to which the mill owners are resolute.COLONIES,   &amp;c. IN AFRICA.Pan-African Congress in Paris.  The Pan-African Congress of representatives of the coloured races of Africa, under the Presidency&apos;&apos; of M. Diagne, French Deputy for Senegal, ended its sittings on February 21st. The resolution passed at the end of the meeting has been published as follows : The Governments of the Allies and their Associates should establish an inter-national code of laws for the protection of natives. A permanent secretariat in the League of Nations should see to the application of thesg laws.The coloured races of the world desire that henceforth the natives of Africa and peoples of African origin should be governed everywhere in accordance with the following principles : (1) The Land. The soil and its natural resources shall be reserved and safe-guarded for the natives, wdio shall have effective ownership of the lands they cultivate.(2) Capital. -A system of concessions shall be so fashioned as to prevent the native from, being exploited and the natural riches of the country from being drained. These concessions should be only temporary, and be under State supervision. Note should be taken of the growing- needs of natives, and part of the profits should be used for the moral and material development of the native.(3) Labour. The abolition of slavery and corporal punishment of any nature. The abolition of forced labour, except as a penal procedure for the punishment of crimes.   The promulgation of official labour rules.(4) Education. Every coloured child shall be taught its mother tongue and the language of the trustee nation.   Professional education shall be available.(5) Health. A service of medical assistance, composed of hospitals and- doctors, shall be established by the State which shall be responsible for the welfare of the inhabitants.(6) The State. The coloured races of Africa shall be allowed gradually increased participation in the State, as their intellectual development improves, by virtue of the principle that Governments exist for peoples and not peoples for Governments.
