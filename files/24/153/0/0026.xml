Attention is called to the proceedings of the British Empire Delegation.Canada.The return of the Prime Minister will no doubt involve developments in directions indicated in this Report.The-forthcoming Liberal Convention is arousing considerable interest amongst the Provincial leaders of Liberalism.The Winnipeg strikes seem to show a tendency towards Bolshevism, though the situation will probably soon improve.References to the industrial situation and the decline in the purchasing value of the dollar are important.Newfoundland.The National Government,-formed to meet war conditions, is apparently coming to an end.Australian Commonwealth.The &quot; One Big Union &quot; movement appears to be collapsing, and Trade Unionists are apparently realising that the whole policy involves I.W.W. methods of government.The interview with General Hertzog should be noted. The points made illustrate so clearly the hollowness of the Nationalist case that publicity will probably do good rather than harm.The financial position in the Union is satisfactory.Trading and ownership of land by Indians is receiving consideration in the House of Assembly.India.Information relating 1o the disturbances and to the Home Rule League should receive attention.There is little to report regarding Egypt this week. There are indications that cultivators are beginning to realise the loss which the recent disturbances will entail; in Paris the Nationalist Delegation is not meeting with any greater success. It has been decided to despatch a Commission to Egypt, over which Lord Milner has been invited to preside.South Africa.Other Colonies, Protectorates, &amp;c.H. d&apos;E.Mav 22nd, 1910.

BRITISH  EMPIRE   AND   AFRICA  REPORT.IMPERIAL AFFAIRS.British Empire Delegation.-At a meeting- of -the British Empire Delegation held on May 17th, 1919 (B.E.D. 31) the situation in Afghanistan was considered, and the terms of a telegram, which it was proposed to send to the Viceroy, were approved.SELF-GOVERNING   DOMINIONS.CANADA.Prime Ministers Return. The return of the Prime Minister (Sir Robert borden) to Ottawa from Paris is creating much interest in political circles. It is expected in Ottawa that amongst the events likely to take place on Sir Robert Borden&apos;s return are the immediate introduction of the delayed Budget, the reorganisation of the Cabinet, and a movement towards the formation of a definite Unionist Party.Liberal Convention. The Leader of the Opjoosition (Mr. D. D. Mackenzie&quot;) issued an invitation to Provincial Leaders to attend a meeting in order to discuss the preliminaries of the National Liberal Convention (vide Report No. 119). The Premier of Quebec (Sir Lomer Gouin) was present at the first meeting, and the Premiers of Saskatchewan (Mr. Martin) and New Brunswick (Mr. Foster) accepted invitations. Amongst others accepting were the Ontario Opposition Leader (Mr. W, Proudfoot) ; and. other Provinces (except Manitoba) were represented. The Premier of Manitoba (Mr. Norris) was unable to attend owing to Labour troubles. *Winnipeg Strikes. A general strike at Winnipeg took place on May loth, when 27,000 workmen from the Trades and Labour Council walked out in accordance with instructions. All street cars were taken to the barns, the&apos;building elevators stopped running, postal employees went home, the deliveries of milk, bread and foodstuffs ceased, and 3,000 clerks, bookkeepers, and stenographers employed in the city stopped work. With the exception of an organised emergency crew, the men of the Fire Department walked out, but the Strike Committee ordered the policemen to remain on duty, although members of the force voted solidly in favour of a strike. The walk-out was conducted in an orderly manner ; the Strike Committee arranged for the continuation of the water supply, and for a sufficient staff of hospital operators to ensure an adequate service.A committee of 1,0*00 citizens has been organised with the object of aiding the maintenance of order in the city, and to arrange for the operation of the essential public utilities.The strike conditions are bringing the city completely to a standstill, and the telegraphists have joined the movement.The city is without its telephonic communication, and householders are purchasing-family supplies on the siege basis, expecting that the present state of affairs will continueTor some time.The Minister of Labour (Senator Robertson) and the Minister of the Interior (Mr. Meighen) have left Ottawa for Winnipeg in order to help in dealing with the strike situation. There have been no disorders ; and the Winnipeg City Officials have invited the Trades Union representatives to a Conference which it is hoped will result in a settlement.New Loan. The  Dominion  Minister of  Finance   (Sir  Thomas White)  has &apos; announced that the new Dominion Loan will be issued in the fall of this year. The amount to be called for, and the terms of issue, have not yet been decided upon.
3133Overseas Military: Forces Report. The Dominion Minister of Overseas Military Forces in London (Sir Edward Kemp) took his seat in the Dominion Parliament on May 12th. The Report of his Department states that over eight thousand Canadians held commissions in the Royal Air Force, and that when the Armistice was signed the Canadian Construction Troops in the field numbered nearly 15,000. There were also 4,400 Canadian Railway Troops in England and France, as well as over 26,000 Canadians in the Canadian Forestry Corps. Canadian troops received 17,000 medals, honours and awards, including 53 Victoria Crosses, 1,185 Military Crosses, 19 Distin-distinguished Flying Crosses, 1,200 Distinguished Concl uct Medals, and 6,600 Military Medals.Industrial Situation. The report of Chief Justice Mathers, of the Royal.Commis-sion on Industrial Relations, indicates that the declining purchasing value of the dollar, the existing unemployment and the&quot; fear of unemployment  are the chief -contributing causes of the present industrial situation, which is regarded in certain parts of the country as decidedly serious. -The Minister of Labour (Senator Robertson) is showing great interest in the cjuestion of the cost of living, and states that the Government is giving serious -consideration to the matter..Soldier Settlement. The Minister of the Interior (Mr. A. Meighen) has introduced -the new Soldier Settlement Bill in the House of Commons and the Bill has been given its First Reading, - -The Bill makes provision for the Soldier Settlement Board to carry out the principles adopted in order to place returned men on the land, to assist them in making a start in agricultural occupations, and also to open up new territory where agricultural progress has been retarded. Under the new measure the Soldier Settlement Board may purchase compulsorily. if necessary, such lands as are deemed necessary, and the Act, as a whole, will provide for the relief and assistance of returned soldiers who decide to take to the land. Soldier farmers will be instructed in their new work by being placed under successful farmers, while agHcultural training stations will also be provided.Immigrants entering the Dominion. During the fiscal year ended March 31st last 57,000 immigrants entered Canada, of whom 40,000 came from the United States and 9.900 from the United Kingdom. Thirty-five per cent, of the immigrants arrived in the month of March.Prohibition Legislation. The feature&apos; of the new prohibition legislation intro-duced into Parliament, which has now passed the Committee Stage of the Commons, is the fact that the Dominion Government will maintain a hold on the transportation of alcoholic liquors. While recognising the rights of Provinces regarding the enactment of Provincial laws for the manufacture and sale of beer and wines in the several Provinces, the Federal Government continues to control the transportation between the Provinces which remain prohibited. As at present&apos;constituted, the Bill will not permit of the importation of native wines from Ontario into Quebec, but Sir Thomas White announced that an amendment will be introduced governing this matter.NEWFOUNDLAND.Cabinet Crisis. It is announced in the Press that the National Government has broken up and that the Minister of Finance (Mr. Cashin) resigned on May 20th. The Prime Minister (Sir W. Lloyd) is stated to have tendered his resignation..AUSTRALIAN  COMMONWEALTH.One Big Union&apos;&quot; Movement.- The Federal Council of the Australian Workers&apos; Union have decided to reject the scheme for the fusion of all labour organisations m &quot; one big Union.&quot; The movement is being opposed by representative trade unionists on the ground, that it is associated with the methods of the Industrial Workers of the World and, if successful, would.result in the disruption of the trade -unions.
Premier of Western Australia. Mr. Cole batch having resigned the Premiership-of Western Australia, Mr. Mitchell, Minister of Lands and Repatriation, has been appointed Premier and Leader of the Nationalist Party in the State.Arrival of Lord Jellicoe. Lord Jellicoe arrived at Albany on May 15th and proceeded eastward where warm welcomes were arranged. Press reports indicate that in his speeches Lord Jellicoe is referring to the larger responsibility which Australia must take in naval affairs since she has increased her possessions in the Pacific.Returned Soldiers and Compulsory Service. Returned soldiers have been exempted from compulsory service under the Defence Act, Many are joining the special reserve voluntarily.Council for Northern Territory. An Advisory Council for the Northern Territory consisting of seven members has been approved of : it is to consist of three-officials and two representatives of Labour and one of the mining and pastoral interests respectively.Coal Industry. As a result of the intervention of the Acting Premier i&apos;Mr. Watt) in regard to the threatened strike, the coal-mining agreements have been fidly accepted by mine owners and miners and the trade unions are operating peacefully. Broken Hill mines continue closed, although the conflicting, unions have composed their differences. A shortage of coal owing to industrial disturbances and the refusal of carpenters to work because of unsettled grievances prevents the mines re-opening.Exportation of Hides and Leather. The Federal Government have released hides and leather from all restrictions on exportation. For some time open market prices have been higher than Australian fixed prices. Exportation is conditional on the Customs authorities being satisfied that the tanners and boot manufacturers in Australia have had an opportunity of buying such supplies at market prices. The Minister for Customs has refused a request to recommend an export duty on untreated -wool in the interest of Australian fellmongers.Export of Meat and Butter. A conference of Victorian farmers has demanded an open market for the export of meat and butter. The farmers say they have made sufficient war sacrifices in accepting less than the worlcfs prices.SOUTH AFRICA.Nationalist Mission. In an interview recently given to the Press, General Hertzog stated that the object of the Nationalist mission to England was in the first instance to obtain the reparation of the injustice which was clone to the Orange Free State and Transvaal in 1902 when &quot; we were deprived of our freedom and our independence.&quot; The advocacy of independence for other parts of South Africa, he said, was a matter of secondary concern. He continued : &quot; We have been supported in our mission by the fact that since our departure the Provincial Council of the Orange Free State have adopted, unanimously but for one vote, a resolution claiming the complete independence of the Orange Free State.&quot; General Hertzog proceeded to point out that the Nationalist party came into existence in 1913 as a protest against &quot; the Imperialistic policy of General Botha and his Government.&quot; The main principle, he observed, of the Nationalist programme has been, from the beginning, that it is the duty of the Government and the right of the people that in the con-sideration of any problem in which South Africa is involved the interests of South Africa should be the deciding factor. This principle stood in direct opposition to the policy now as always pursued and proclaimed by the Imperialists of South Africa, viz., that in all questions existing between England and South Africa the interests of - the Empire must override those of South Africa,Giving reasons why no national policy can be consistently carried out &quot; while we remain in our present position of dependence,&quot; General Hertzog says the following may be mentioned : &quot; First there is the allegation by the Imperialists, supported by General Botha and his Government, that our self-government is of the nature of a mere conditional grant, and that it can be withdrawn at any time if the British Parliament so desires, or if it is exercised in a manner contrary to the will of the British people.   The disadvantages to our national interests of such a state of
affairs, if correct, are obvious. Those who are charged with the duties of government are as likely, under such circumstances and during times of stress, to keep their eye on what may be considered the wishes of the British Government, as they would be to look after the true interests of South Africa.&quot; Then this- so-called.self-government stops the moment it comes to the question of war or peace ; the moment England becomes involved in a war we are automatically dragged into it, as has just been the case. As it is with war, so it is with peace-we may be consulted with regard to the terms of peace, but the decisive voice we have not got; that belongs to England.&quot;Financial Position. In the Union House of Assembly on May 12th the Finance Minister (Sir T. Orr), after moving that the House go into Committee on Ways and Means on the taxation outlined in his Budget statement of February 19th last, gave figures showing that for the year 1918-19 there would be a surplus of 411,000Z. instead of a deficit of 69,000Z. as had been anticipated. The Customs returns had increased by 1,684,000Z. The total estimated revenue for 1919-20 was 20,833,000Z. and the expenditure 22,860,000Z., leaving a deficit of 2,027,000Z. The proposed taxation, said Sir T. Orr, would produce 1,395;000Z., leaving 632,000Z. still to be met. The Minister foreshadowed the necessity of further taxation to meet the deficit.Pay of Overseas Contingent. The loan estimates for 1919-20, totalling 10,105,000Z., which have been laid on the table of the House of Assembly, include provision for making up the pay of members of the South African Overseas contingent to Union rates for service prior to January 1st, 1917.Convention of Returned Soldiers. It has been announced in Canada that a Con-vention of be turned Soldiers&apos; organisations will be held in 1920 in South Africa, when delegates from all parts of the British Empire will be present.Exports to Neidral Countries.- The Union Ministers have informed the British Government that exporters in South Africa are anxious to take advantage of the present opjjortunity to open neAv avenues of trade. It is pointed out that delay is experienced in the issue of permits for export to neutral countries owing to the reference of applications to the British Government. In view of the sweeping modifications made by the Board of Trade, the need for the delay is not understood in the Union, and the South African Ministers state that Portuguese East Africa buyers of Union produce find no difficulty in exporting from Portuguese East Africa. As the Ministers are considering a Bill to control imports and exports when peace is declared, they desire that a procedure should be adopted which will minimise criticism, and they therefore enquire whether there is now any necessity to confer with the British Government in cases of export to neutral countries and whether they may exercise their discretion in the matter.Indian Trading and Land Ownership. In the House of Assembly on May 15th Mr. Eooth moved the second reading of the Bill dealing with the ownership and occupation of land and trading by Asiatics in the proclaimed mining areas of the Transvaal. The Bill embodies the report of the Select Committee of which Mr. Rooth was Chairman, which recommended that the vested trading rights of Indians carrying on business in June 1914 at the time of the Smuts-Gandhi agreement be respected, also the vested rights of Indians who have since obtained trading licences ; further, giving Indians the right to transfer businesses to other Indians residing in the Transvaal, but rendering it impossible to obtain further trading licences or to open new businesses. The Bill also embodies the Committee&apos;s suggestion to extend the prohibition against Asiatics owning fixed property to companies in which Asiatics have a controlling interest. The last-named recommendation was due to the discovery that while Asiatics are prohibited from owning land it is legally possible for them to form companies and own land. Mr. Rooth stated that at the beginning of 1919 there were 370 such companies, 24 more have since been registered, while between 40 and 50 applications were being considered.Sir Abe Bailey, while agreeing Avith the recognition of the vested rights, opposed permission being giA^en to transfer businesses which, he said, would be simply giving Indians the goodwill of business in the TransATaal. He also advocated the cancellation, of companies AAdtere it Avas found that they had circumvented the law.
INDIA..   Blots -The Viceroy reported by telegram on May 12th that-Lahore and Armitsar were quiet.At Ferozepore, it was reported that a public meeting had been held at Fazilka on 2nd May, when regret had been expressed for Hartal and the Rowlatt Bill agitation had been condemned.The Lahore Gate riot case, a sequel of the Lahore Mall riot case,&apos; resulted in the conviction of seven and acquittal of two of the accused. The seven convicted men were sentenced to transportation for life and forfeiture.On May 13th the Viceroy reported that at a representative gathering of Moslems, Sikhs and Hindus at Lahore, the lieutenant-Governor of the Punjab received from all communities convincing&quot; assurances of support to the Government in the present crisis.      &apos; &apos;Home Bale League.- The National Home Rule League has decided to send a deputation to Great Britain to advocate, the objects of the League and support the Mon.tagu-Ohelmsfo.rd Reform Bill with such modifications as may be obtainable in co-operation with the other, deputations. They will also submit a petition to the King-Emperor to raise India to the position of a free nation upon an equality with the self-governing Dominions and to refuse to sanction the Rowlatt Act.Furthermore, while suspending their agitation against the Rowlatt Act and forming a Committee of Public Order to support the Government in preserving peace during the present troubles, the members of the League pledge themselves to take up a law-abiding attitude for the repeal of the Act when the dangers are completely over.Famine. The Viceroy reported to the India Office on 16th May that famine had been declared in the Sadar sub-division of Angul district in Bihar and Orissa. Test works were being opened in Nandigama Taluka of Kistna district in Madras Presidency. Distress continued severe in the affected tracts of Etawah. The number of persons on relief were increasing in Bundelkhand. The numbers relieved were Bengal, last week figures: test works 1,014, district board works 5,336, gratuitous relief 8,149. Bihar and Orissa, last week figures : test works 9,922, gratuitous relief 4,442. Feudatory States, Orissa : test works 12,411, gratuitous relief 16,169. United Provinces of Agra and Oudh, last week figures : test works 15,171, gratuitous relief 13,679. Rajputana: relief works 1,582, test works 4,661, gratuitous relief r4,943.

Bombay: relief 84,264, village works 7,705, test works 1,964, gratuitous relief 84,809.   Madras report not received.It was expected that recent developments on the frontier might reduce the quantities of wheat and grain which could be drawn for deficit juovinces from the -Punjab.OTHER COLONIES,s PROTECTORATES, &amp;c.EGYPT.The Situation &apos; Hesult of Disturbances : The Nationalists. The country continues quiet, and there&apos; is nothing to report except a strike of the employees of the Suez Canal Company, which has led to a more or less general strike at Port Said. The naval and military authorities have maintained the canal and commercial services. There is no reason to connect this strike with the recent disturbances, but it appears to be due to economic reasons. There is evidence that the small cultivators are beginning to blame the lawyer and student classes for promoting an agitation which
lias not succeeded, and has resulted in grave material damage and restriction of railway facilities for passengers and agricultural produce. Communications are beginning to open up in the Delta, but it will be a long time before they return to normal, owing to the damage done to rolling-stock and to the prolonged strike of workmen which has only recently ended.. In Upper Egypt a tri-weekly mail service to the Sudan has been opened. The damage to the State railways alone is estimated at a quarter of a million pounds.Further information is now available as to the loss sustained by foreigners in Egypt. The loss to the Greek community is estimated to exceed 600,000L Ten Greeks have been killed and as many wounded ; the casualties to Armenians, in Cairo only, are 15 killed and 11 wounded. Full reports&apos;- of casualties to foreigners in the Provinces have not yet been received, but General Allenby has reported that the total British civilian casualties in the recent disturbances amount to four killed only. The Nationalists are continuing to spread reports of atrocities committed by British troops, and a body described as &quot; The Egyptian Association of Great Britain,&quot; writing from the Imperial Hotel, Russell Square, London, has recently distributed a scurrilous circular, in which it is asserted that British soldiers have burnt villages, murdered the inhabitants, violated women, and stolen money and jewellery from the fellahin wholesale.&quot;The Egyptian Delegation&quot; in Paris are not making much progress, and complain very much that no one wishes to hear them.Commission of Enquiry: future. Constitution.-It has been decided to despatch a Commission to Egypt, over which Lord Milner has been invited to preside. The Commission will enquire into the causes of the late disorders in Egypt, report on the existing situation in the country, and the form of Constitution which, under the Protectorate, will be best calculated to promote its peace and prosperity, the pro-gressive development of self-governing institutions, and the protection of foreign interests.It is not possible to state as yet the date of departure of the Commission, or its exact composition.
