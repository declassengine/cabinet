SECRET.3APPRECIATION OF THE ATTACHED REPORT No. 100.BRITISH EMPIRE AND AFRICA.Imperial Affairs.The proposals relating to the representation of the Dominions and India at the Peace Conference and Allied Preliminary Conference are of considerable Imperial importance.&apos;   . Canada.; - .&apos;The statement of the Minister of Public Works as to the importance of the representation of Canada at the peace table by the Prime Minister, provides a further view of a prominent Liberal on a matter of vital interest to the Dominion.The review of the first year&apos;s work of the Union Government is an interesting record of achievement.Criticism upon the expedition to Siberia still continues, and the Minister of Militia&apos;s defence of the Governments policy will perhaps hardly appeal to those who adopt a somewhat restricted outlook.Mr. Rowell has explained that the differences between Englishrspeaking Liberals and Sir W. Laurier centred mainly round war policy and the bi-lingual question.The pronouncement of the Ontario farmers in favour of Free Trade with the United States is significant, but it should be remembered that both these and the western farmers have declared themselves in favour of Free Trade with Great Britain.Other items of interest in the Report dealt with labour claims, unlawful associations, housing, &amp;c.Australian Commonwealth.The importance of the forthcoming visit of Lord J ellicoe in relation to future Australian naval preparations is fully recognised in the statements of the Minister for the Navy and the Acting Prime Minister. While realising the need of uniformity in construction and training, the Commonwealth standpoint contemplates the control of their own ships by the Dominions.The work of the Ministerial representative in London as regards the training of men during demobilisation is outlined.The steps being taken to survey the air route between England and Australia are of interest.The statement of the Premier of Queensland on Labour policy derives additional interest from the fact that Mr. Ryan may before long take a prominent part in Federal politics.[p.t.o.
South Africa.It has now &quot;been made clear to the public of South Africa that the Union Governments policy is to press for the incorporation of German South West Africa in the Union, but to claim no more than consultation as to the disposal of German East Africa.The Native Congress resolutions are of significance mainly by reason of the objections raised to the disposal of territory, or alteration in forms of government, without reference to the native inhabitants.In three recent by-elections there has been one Nationalist gain, the other two seats remaining to the South African and Unionist parties respectively.India.The reform scheme put forward by the Burma Government aims at creating machinery for complete local self-government. The communal representation proposals are of interest.The extremists appear to be still agitating against the recommendation^ of the Rowlatt Committee.The Government of India are consulting the local governments on the proposals of the Industrial Commission.H. d&apos;E.January 2nd, 1919.

BRITISH  EMPIRE  AND  AFRICA  REPORT.IMPERIAL AFFAIRS.Dominion and Indian Representation at Peace Congress. -The French Govern-ment have been informed that with regard to representation at the Peace Congress, the Imperial War Cabinet agree that the Allied Great Powers should appoint five plenipotentiaries, but they consider that the panel system should be adopted for the selection of the five. It is thought that none of the smaller Powers should have more than two representatives each. The agreement with the French Government (reached at the recent inter-Allied conversations in London) as to the representation of the Dominions and India is recalled, and it is stated that the Imperial War Cabinet assume that Dominion and Indian representatives will have the same powers as and be on an equality with the representatives of Belgium and other smaller Allied States, and that they will be present at the opening and other Sessions of the Peace Conference or the Allied Preliminary Conference (if held), at which Belgium and other smaller Allied States are represented.SELF-GOVERNING   DOMINIONS.CANADA.Prime Minister and Peace Discussions. The Minister of Public Works (Mr. F. B. Carvell) in a speech at Montreal last month made the following statement, regarding the representation of the Dominion at the Peace Conference. He said : &quot; At this, the most important Conference in the history of the world, in which the British Empire is intensely interested, the Empire must be represented not only by the British Government but by the Oversea Dominions, and especially by Canada, whose contribution of blood and treasure entitles her to a prominent seat at the peace table. It is not only proper but imperative that Canada be represented to the end by her Prime Minister.   He should stay just as long as anything remains to be done.&quot;Work of the Union Government. The Acting Prime Minister (Sir Thomas White) has issued a review of the first year&apos;s efforts of the present Union Government. The statement refers to National Registration last June as having provided valuable information for the work of reconstruction. It points out that the munitions industry of the country was maintained at a high degree of efficiency largely through the establishment of extensive credits arranged by the Government, while the agricultural output of the Dominion was substantially increased owing to the Governments efforts in this respect. The Acting Premier refers in the statement to the splendid success of the Victory Loan as evidence of &quot;nation-wide prosperity,&quot; and he directs attention to the assistance given by the Federal Treasury in the matter of providing better trading accommodation in the various provinces, as well as to the additional taxation of war profits and incomes, the consolidation of the Government Railways, and the successful operations of the Canada Food Board in the effort to save food for overseas consumption. In reference to the Military Service Act, Sir Thomas White points out that owing to the vigorous and impartial enforcement of the Act by the Government, over 80,000 men were obtained as reinforcements in addition to some 25,000 others who were released on compassionate grounds.Men provided for the War. The Minister of Militia (Major-General S. C. Mewburn) has announced that during the period of the war a total of 611,741 men have passed through the hands of the Canadian military machine in one form or another. The exact number enlisted up to November 15th last was 595,441, but an additional 16,300 were struck off the strength by the recruiting authorities. The voluntary enlistments totalled approximately 466,000, while 83,355 were secured under the Military Service Act.
Demobilisation by Units. The Minister of Overseas Military Forces (Sir Edward Kemp) states that plans have now been made and approved providing for the demobili-sation of the Canadian Corps by units. Every unit of the Corps will be allotted to a dispersal area in Canada. The personnel of existing units will be redistributed to units of their own arm of the service, in accordance with the dispersal area to which they desire to be returned. The remainder of the Canadian Overseas Forces, such as the units employed on lines of communication in France and England, will be returned home on the draft system in accordance with the system of priorities laid down in the general scheme of the Demobilisation Committee.Value of Siberian Expedition. The Minister of Militia (General Mewburn) in replying to a protest from the Wentworth County Council against sending Canadian soldiers to Siberia, has explained that the expedition is necessary in fulfilment of the pledge given to the British Government. One result of Canadian participation, the Minister states, Avili be to raise Canada&apos;s prestige in Russia, and the effect will be felt when commerce is extended to Siberia. General Mewburn adds that it may be possible to withdraw the forces in the spring.Liberals and Sir W. Laurier. The President of the Privy Council (Mr. N. W. Rowell) in a speech just before Christmas in Ontario, replying to criticism as to the disloyalty of those Liberals who had entere*d the Union Govern-ment, pointed out that there were two questions of paramount importance upon which the Liberals who were associated with him were unable to agree with Sir Wilfrid Laurier, namely, bi-lingual schools and Canada&apos;s war policy. He proceeded : &quot; Every Liberal was anxious beyond measure that Sir Wilfrid should continue to lead a united party, and every effort was put forth to induce him to take up a position upon which the English-speaking Liberals could stand, and at the same time be true to their convictions, but without success. It was onlv after the fullest and frankest discussion and repeated conferences with Sir W. Laurier, extending over not only weeks, but months, that it became evident that an agreement was impossible. Then it was that a group of Liberals from the different Provinces agreed to the formation of the Union Government.&quot;The Bi-Lirigual Question. In the course&apos;of a debate in the Saskatchewan Legislature upon the School Act amendment, the Premier of the Province (Mr. Martin) made a strong appeal for the special treatment of French. The Opposition Leader (Mr. Maclean) demanded that no such exception be made, and moved an amendment to the effect that no language other than English be taught in the schools. Mr. Motherwell, who recently resigned from the Government, argued that it would be unfair to put the French tongue on the same basis as other non-English languages.Labour Claims in Saskatchewan. Delegates representing the Saskatchewan Executive of the Trades and Labour Congress of Canada met the Provincial Cabinet at Regina recently, and put before the Government the legislative requests of organised labour in the Province. The requests made were for free dental and medical services in the schools;, free text-books and supplies; the provision of employment during the period of demobilisation by the execution of necessary public work ; compulsory payment of wages in currency ; minimum wages for women ; free hospitals ; and a compulsory half-holiday weekly for all employees.Farmers and Free Trade loith the United States. -The United Farmers of Ontario in their Convention at Toronto have adopted free trade with the United States as one of the planks in their platform, but this attitude is contingent upon similar action being taken on the part of the United States. The Convention also adopted without discussion the resolution recently approved by the Western farmers at Winnipeg calling for free trade between Great Britain and Canada by the gradual reduction of the customs tariff within five years. The farmers propose to make up the loss of revenue by means of a direct tax upon unimproved land values, including all natural resources, by a graduated personal income tax, by a graduated inheritance tax on large estates, and a graduated tax on the profits of corporations.The farmers approved of prohibition, but condemned the Siberian expedition.
Inter-Provincial Conference and Immigration Arrangements. In the course of a memorandum submitted to the recent Inter-Provincial Conference it is recommended that the Federal Government remain responsible for the admission of immigrants, but it is suggested that the case of settlers from Great Britain and friendly countries be placed in the hands of Provincial authorities. The appointment of a Federal Land Settlement Board with provincial representation is also suggested.Rousing Scheme. In furtherance of the Dominion Governments housing scheme a Sub-Committee of the Cabinet has been appointed, and will be known as the Housing Committee. It will be composed of Mr. N. W. Powell (Chairman), Senator Gicl eon Robertson, Mr. A. T\. Maclean, and Mr. T. A. Crerar. The Committee is authorised to take up with the several Provinces without delay the need for additional housing accommodation. The Government recently set aside $25,000,000 for advances to the Provinces to assist them in their efforts to secure better housing accommod ati on.Unlawful Associations. The Order-in-Council which placed a war-time ban upon the I. WAV. and similar organisations in the Dominion has been amended and the general clauses have been so extended as to include, among others, an association which advises that any class should forcibly take possession of all property, &quot; or forcibly abolish all private ownership of property,&quot; or &quot;which teaches, advocates, advises or defends the cheating or defrauding of employers of labour by accepting employment with the secret purpose and intention of slackening or retarding production, and thereby decreasing the profits of such employers or of otherwise interfering with and injuring their trade and business.&quot; &apos;Amongst the Associations named as unlawful in the amending Order-in-Council are (in addition to the I.W.W.) the Russian Social Democratic Party, the Finnish Social Democratic Party, the Social Labour Party, the Revolutionary Socialist Party of North America, the Chinese Labour Association, &amp;c.Reconstruction and Trade Expansion Abroad. The Minister of Immigration and Colonisation (Mr. J. A. Calder) reports that a further indication of the imminent expansion of Canada&apos;s export trade is the fact that two. of the largest Canadian Chartered Banks, the Bank of Montreal and the Royal Bank of Canada, have announced the forthcoming opening of branches in Paris, in order to assist in financing the trade of the Dominion in connection with the reconstruction of the war devastated areas of Europe. The Royal Bank of Canada has also opened a branch office at Barcelona, Spain, in connection with the extensive West Indian interests of the Bank.AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH.Fleet Visit to the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth Government have now formally conveyed their request to the British Government that a visit may be arranged to Australian waters of a fleet comprising British, Allied, and captured men-of-war and submarines to join in the peace celebrations (vide Report No. 99). It is pointed out that this visit wordd enable the people to see the vessels which have played so great a part in securing victory, and would also have a considerable educational effect.In reply the Admiralty have expressed their sympathy with the proposal and have promised to do all they can. It is added, however, that until the international situation is more settled, it will be impracticable to give a definite decision.Visit of Lord Jellicoe. The Minister for the Navy (Sir Joseph Cook) made some interesting references last month to the forthcoming visit of Lord Jellicoe to the Dominions. He said : &quot;I am naturally gratified that the Board of Admiralty and the War Cabinet have acceded to my request, first made several months ago, that Lord Jellicoe should be permitted to help us in this way. Lord Jellicoe will be able to speak with an authority which all must recognise, and, with Iris help and advice, we hope to develop a policy which will make the best of our resources.. I venture also to hope that Lord Jellicoe&apos;s visit will lead to a more general appreciation of the value and significance of the Royal Australian Navy. A naval officer who joins or otherwise assists the Royal Navy is still serving the Empire Avhich is the mother of
us all. AVhat is required is a constant circulation of the best naval ability through the Empire, coupled with a full recognition of the principle that an officer who goes abroad to a Dominion should be entitled to special recognition on that account. Lord Jellicoe will advise us on the whole naval position-ships, personnel, bases, and the general naval policy which must determine the nature and extent of our naval preparations.&quot; fief erring to the general principles of Australian co-operation, Sir J. Cook said: &quot;It is fundamental to the idea of Empire naval defence that, though the Dominions retain the control of their ships, there should be a complete standardisation of personnel and ships and equipment, and that this should be up to the level of the best.&quot;Speaking upon Lord - Jellicoe&apos;s visit in the House of Representatives on December ,24th, the Acting Prime Minister (Mr. Watt) said :. &quot; Members will recollect that some time ago, when speaking on the Loan Bills, I intimated that the Government desired to revise the whole question of the Fleet and Naval Base programme of the Commonwealth, and was endeavouring to secure the services of an eminent expert. Sir Joseph Cook, Minister of the Navy, has been in constant touch with the Admiralty authorities in London. Now that the demobilisation of the Navy is in prospect, he has been enabled to accomplish a thing which will gratify the people of Australia. Last evening I received a cable from Sir Joseph Cook, intimating that it had been definitely decided that Lord Jellicoe would leave for Australia in February to review the whole naval position. This news will arouse feelings of confidence and pride amongst the people of Australia. It is an indication of our increasing importance that the Imperial authorities should have selected a man who has served his country so illustriously during this war, while it vail also ensure that wre will obtain the best advice that modern science and shipcraft can give us.&quot;   The announcement was received with loud cheers.Training during Demobilisation: W-ork of Minister in London. On the motion for the adjournment of the Federal House of Representatives on December 24th, the Acting Prime Minister (Mr. Watt) made an important statement upon the work of training men during demobilisation, - and the necessity of sending a responsible Minister to London in view of the probable movements of the Prime Minister and Minister for the Navy. Mr. Watt said: &quot; Since the termination, of hostilities, demobilisation, embarkation, and- repatriation of Australian&apos; overseas forces have received the unremitting attention of the Govern-ment. Intimate consultation by cable has been conducted between .the Prime Minister and the Cabinet, with the result that a scheme for the handling of the im-portant problems involved has been adopted. This necessitates the creation in Britain of a control embracing military and civilian personnel. The work to be accomplished at the other end includes, in addition to shipping, feeding, and clothing our men between the period of actual demobilisation and embarkation in Britain, the great task of providing suitable training for so extensive a force during the inevitable period of idleness. This period, it seems, will cover from nine to 12 months, however excellent may be the shipping arrangements to return our men to Australia. The Governments design is to see that for men.who desire, during this period of waiting, to secure training in primary or secondary industries in which they formerly had been engaged, or wish to be engaged, the opportunity will be available for them. This phase of the question must be regarded as preparatory to repatriation. After reviewing the whole matter the Government have now decided that this, work must be presided over by a responsible Minister. The Prime Minister will return as soon as the duties of the Allied Conference and Peace Conference permit. It is, of course, impossible to fix the date at the present moment. The Minister for the Navy must return for the visit of Lord Jellicoe. It will therefore be necessary to despatch a Minister to London to arrive in sufficient time to take over the organisation and administration. This will be arduous work with little opportunity to learn the elements of the business. The Cabinet have therefore requested Senator Pearce, Minister for Defence, to proceed to London to discharge this important undertaking. Senator Pearce has consented, and his departure will be conditioned by the receipt of more definite information as to the movements of the Prime Minister and Minister for the Navy at the other end of the world.&quot;    -Cost of liecruiting. The Minister for Defence (Senator Pearce) has supplied a return to the Senate, showing that the cost of recruiting from January 1st to October 31st was 316,308L7185-la B
Air Route from England to Australia. The Air Ministry have been ashed by General Salmond at Delhi for their approval of two officers proceeding, by sea to reconnoitre the air route to Australia via Burma, Singapore, Java, Flores Island to Timor or other suitable route. It is suggested they should travel hy coasting steamer, storing oil and petrol at the lauding grounds suggested, and return by air. The Air Ministry are asked to arrange with the Commonwealth Government for reconnaissance of landing grounds at 350 to 450 miles intervals from Melbourne to Port Darwin.The Dutch authorities are being asked to give every assistance.Labour Policy. The Premier of Queensland (Mr. T. J. Ryan) who is one of the leading representatives of Labour in the Commonwealth made a statement on Labour policy before leaving Australia for England last month. He declared that the Nationalist Party was composed of reactionary factions which the Labour Party expected to defeat, and he expounded the Labour Party&apos;s policy as one of cheap prices and generous insurances and compensations for workmen. He urged that there should be wider Federal powers, with the sub-division of the larger States into smaller local governments. Asked whether he intended to enter Federal politics, Mr. Ryan said that there were 50 reasons why he should do this, but the one reason agaiast it was that he had not yet been asked.NEW ZEALAND.Labour Situation. The Annual Report of the New Zealand Employers&apos; Federation contains some interesting references to the Labour position in the Dominion. The Report says that while there have been no outstanding labour troubles during the year, a movement on the part of militant Labour to destroy the system of conciliation and arbitration has been obvious. The Arbitration Court, the Report continues, established contrary to the wishes of employers, has consistently strained its powers to grant every legitimate concession to the workers. Nevertheless, the seamen, coal-miners, and tram way men broke its awards. The Report urges prompt action to ensure the due observance of industrial laws, and advises employers to be reasonable and Labour carefully to consider the alternative before abandoning the system.SOUTH AFRICA.Government Policy regarding German Colonies and Enemy Subjects. The Minister of Justice (Mr. De Wet), speaking last month at the Diamond Diggers&apos; Congress said that he welcomed the Resolution asking that the German Colonies should be retained within the British Empire. The Union Government, he said,-had taken up the attitude that German South-West Africa should be handed over to the Union Government, and that the Union Government should be consulted regarding the disposal of German East Africa! That policy was supported by the whole of South Africa, even by the Nationalists, although the latter might not admit it. Mr. De Wet also endorsed the statement made by Mr. Burton, Minister of Railways, at Ladysmith a few days ago to the effect that the Government had decided to repatriate firstly, all enemy subjects who desired to leave, and secondly, all enemy subjects whose conduct had caused them to be regarded as dangerous to the State.Meetings upon German Colonies. A representative public meeting which was held in the City Hall at Cape Town on December 14th passed unanimous resolutions demanding the retention of the German African Colonies, protesting against the inhuman treatment of British and Allied prisoners of war, and urging the Imperial Government to punish the responsible parties irrespective of rank.The Administrator of the Cape Province, in moving the first resolution, declared that the retention of German South-West Africa and German East Africa was one of the most essential conditions of the peace settlement. The German menace in Africa was past, but if they allowed the Germans to retain a foothold in the continent the danger must recur. He was convinced that if Germany had won the war, the German flag would eventually have flown over Cape Town.    Mr. Jagger, member of the
House of Assembly, seconding the resolution, said he thought the restoration of the German Colonies in Africa would be the biggest crime against humanity ever perpetrated, while from the point of view of safety, their return was impossible.A large meeting at Port Elizabeth adopted resolutions similar to those passed at East London regarding the retention of the German Colonies, with the additional demand that the German inhabitants of South-West and East Africa should not be enfranchised for a period of ten years. &apos;        ;Native Congress and Disposal of Territories. The South African Native Congress on December 21st adopted an Address to His Majesty King George which, after expressing satisfaction at the victorious termination of the war and loyalty to the Throne,&quot;mentions the various services rendered by the natives in the prosecution of the war, adding that they have also contributed cattle and money to the best of their means and maintained the supply of labour for the gold mines and other of the -country&apos;s industries. The Address further petitions His Majesty that the Basutoland, Swaziland, and Bechuanaland Protectorates shall not be handed over to the Union until the consent of. their respective peoples has been obtained. It further urges that it is unfair that 6,000,000 natives, constituting the backbone of the country, shall remain without a voice in its affairs and administration, and asks for a revision of the -South Africa Act so as to remove the colour bar from the franchise. The conquered territories of South-West and East Africa should not, the Address proceeds, be disposed of without consulting the inhabitants of those territories, and in any event should not be handed over to the Union until the South Africa Act has been amended as previous mentioned. In the event of the white races of the Union coming to an agreement in favour of the establishment of a Republican Government, His Majesty and the Imperial Government should not sanction such a step unless a majority of the native population of the Union and of the Protectorates consented.At a previous meeting of the Congress it wTas decided to send a delegation of nine to England to place before the Imperial authorities the disabilities of which the coloured and native people complain.By-Elections, The by-election at Ladismith (Cape Province) to fill the vacancj? caused by the death of the Chief Government Whip (Mr. Becker) resulted in a Nationalist victory. The Nationalist obtained 1,169 votes as against 1,196 cast for the Ministerial candidate. At the b3?--election for the Harbour Division of Cape Town, which was a Unionist seat, the- Unionist candidate obtained a clear majority over two Labour candidates. At Riversdale (Cape Province) which had been represented by a :South African Party supporter, the seat fell again to General Botha&apos;s supporter, the Nationalist being defeated by 1,577 votes to 1,486.General De Wet and Nationalist Delegation. The report that the Government had refused a passport to General De Wet to accompany the Nationalist delegation to Europe (vide Report No. 99) in connection with the Peace Conference is officially denied. The embargo imposed on General De Wet after- the rebellion is still operative and thus there is no question of a passport being given.Unity of Africander People. General Lemmer, who was one of the Republican leaders in the Boer War, in a speech at Riversdale, Cape Province, appealed to the Nationalists not to divide the Africander people but to unite in developing South Africa as a great nation under the present free Constitution. General Lemmer admitted, previous regrets at the loss of the independence of the two Boer Republics, but he and others had long ago followed the great leader, General Botha, in the belief that from the ashes the Africanders would rise as a great nation. A striking part of General Lemmer&apos;s speech was a criticism of the Nationalists who, he said, had not assisted to win the war, but now the war was won, expected to get something out of it by sending a deputation to the Peace Conference to obtain independence. -Woman Franchise. The Women&apos;s Enfranchisement Association of South Africa has asked General Botha to convey to the representatives of the British Empire at the Conference which is to deal with inter-Imperial relations and reconstruction a ^request that the women of South Africa be granted full citizen rights similar to those
now enjoyed by the women of&apos; Great Britain and the other self-governing Dominions. The Association also urges that any amendment to the naturalisation laws of the Empire shall include the granting to all women of the Empire the right to retain their British nationality on marriage with an alien.INDIA.(Excluding External Affairs, which are dealt with- in the Eastern Report.)Reform Scheme for Burma, The Burma Government have put forward a reform scheme which aims at creating the machinery for complete local and provincial self-government. All the local boards are wholly unofficial. Elective district councils are to be formed, each electing one representative to the Legislative Assembly. The latter will consist of 75 members, 52 being elected, Communal representation is provided for Europeans, Anglo-Indians, and Chinese-Indians. Instead of advisory councils, four boards are constituted for home affairs, finance, development, and self-government. The Province surrenders representation in the Indian Assembly for three members of the Indian State Council and a Secretary for Burma Affairs.Extremists and Rowlatt Gommittee.-The extremist newspapers are continuing their agitation against the measures recommended by the Rowlatt Committee to take the place of the Defence of India Act. Mrs. Besant&apos;s organ has declared that every member of the Legislative Council who votes for coercion will be branded as a traitor to his country.Hindus and Muhammadans. The annual police report of the Province states that the result of the Bihar riots is to widen the gulf between Hind as and muhammadan-madans and to establish a very bitter estrangement whiuh promises to be lasting and portends similar disturbances in the future.Government and Industrial Commission. The Government of India have had the proposals of the Industrial Commission under consideration. They accept the principle that the improvement of Indian industries is an urgent necessity which must form an important part of Government policy. The local governments are being consulted on the recommendations.
