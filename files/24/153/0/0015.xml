SECRET.APPRECIATION OF THE ATTACHED- REPORT: No. 109.BRITISH EMPIRE  AND AFRICA.Imperial Affairs. .Attention is called to the matters discussed by the British Empire Delegation.Canada.The appeal by the new Opposition Leader to the Liberal-Unionists to return to their original allegiance was of course to be expected ; indeed, the choice of an English-speaking Canadian to lead the Liberals may have been considered as likely to assist in this direction. The Liberal-Unionists in the Government, however, have intimated that their immediate work is more important than party controversy.While the Western Grain Growers do not apparently wish to identify themselves with either party, they intend to support their tariff programme by representation in Parliament.The observations of the President of the Trades and Labour Congress as to the connection between prohibition and labour unrest are interesting.Not only does the Dominion Parliament intend to welcome women members, but the Ontario Legislature is taking similar action.Australian Gomai on wealth.Mr. Hughes has made clear to the public his attitude towards the mandatory system. His references to the &quot; open door &quot; no doubt relate mainly to the importance, from the Australian standpoint, of &quot;controlling immigration into the captured territory in New Guinea. It will be interesting to see how the Official Labour Party treat this, having regard to their pronouncement in favour of international administration. (Vide Report No. 106.)The observations of Senator Pearee as to the revision of the Constitution and the study of the South Africa Act of Union, hiutat the desire for a larger measure of Commonwealth control.South Africa.A point of importance has been brought out in the Debate on Republicanism concerning Imperial responsibility for the interests of the natives.-Though from the point of view of logic, it may be difficult to reconcile the refusal of the Nationalists to travel by the Minerva with a belief in the importance of their
mission, there is little doubt that the younger Nationalists considered that the identification of the Deputation with a British warship would be difficult to defend in the country districts. Unfortunately It 1 s in s llc h quarters that the obligations of the people to British sea power are not understood.Foreign Colonies in Africa.The German National Assembly and the Government representatives are naturally trying to make the most of Point 5 of Mr. Wilson&apos;s programme as to Colonial conditions of peace.Attention is invited to an interesting lecture in Berlin relating to Colonial policy.H. d&apos;E.March 6th, 1919,

BRITISH  EMPIRE   AND   AFRICA  REPORT.IMPERIAL AFFAIRS.British Empire Delegation.-At a meeting of the British Empire Delegation on February 27th (B.E.D. 10) the matter of the Supreme Economic Council was under discussion, and it was agreed that as regards the British Empire, the Council should he constituted on the panel system with five representatives for Great Britain, the Dominions and India. It was also agreed that instead of haying two Committees, one British and one for the Dominions and India, to advise the British representatives on the Supreme Economic Council, there should he one British Empire Economic Committee with Lord Robert Cecil as Chairman.Questions relating to the Inter-Allied Economic Commission were also discussed at the. above meeting.At a meeting of the British Empire Delegation held on March 3rd (B.E.D. 12) the subject of equality of trade conditions was discussed.SELF-GOVERNING   DOMINIONS.CANADA.Proceedings in Parliament: Position of Liberal-Unionists: Tariff Question: Soldiers&apos; Pensions : Government Programme. Following, the moving&apos; and seconding of the Address in reply to the Speech from the Throne by the two returned soldier members, Mr. D. D. Mackenzie, the temporary Leader of the Opposition, addressed Parliament. His speech covered a wide field, but his criticism of the Government was confined largely to party politics, and he concluded with an invitation to the Liberal-Unionists to return to the Liberal fold. Mr. Mackenzie assured the Liberal-Unionists &quot; the light is in the window for you, the latch string is on the outside ana you are all welcome.&quot;The Acting Premier (Sir. T. White) told in detail the efforts of the Government to provide employment during the reconstruction period, to cope with the many problems confronting the country and to look after the interests of returned soldiers, to whom the Dominion - owed so much. Lie declared that the present was not the time to talk party&apos; politics, and he did not thin k that the invitations issued by the speakers on the Opposition side to Liberal-Unionists to return to thefold would result in any defections from the Government side of&quot; the Chamber. The problems which the -country was called upon to face &quot;were so vast that the mere matters of party politics assumed secondary importance. Possibly when the ship of State was sailing in smoother waters they might again come to the fore.     .Speaking later on the same subject, the Minister of Immigration and Colonisation (Mr. J. A. Calder) said : &quot; I think 1 am voicing the feeling of every Liberal-Unionist in this House and thousands in the country when I say that we acted as we did because we believed we were doing the right thing. The work immediately in front of us is greater and more-important than the work before us prior to the signing of the armistice.&quot; He declared that this was no time to distract the attention of the countay by controversy over tariffs. Speaking as a Westerner, he said that the tariff issue was one which must be faced, but he did not think that the people expected the Government to deal with a question which had been under consideration for 40 years, whem there were so many other more important problems to solve.
: ...... O -.--0.-.; - ; -:.The Minister for Public Works (Mr. F. B. Carvell) explained what the Public Works Department was doing to help in the problem of. the reconstruction period. He favoured an increase in the income tax in order to meet the heavy financial requirements of the country, and said that $30,000,000 would be required in the current year for soldiers&apos; pensions, which would ultimately be increased to $50,000,000 annually. Mr. Carvell gave the following details of the Governments programme of expenditure, which will -provide employment on a large - scale :-$25,000.000 for shipbuilding this year and $30,000,000 next year; $20,000,000 for highway construction over a period of five years ; over $20,000,000 in loans to Provinces for a housing programme ; $ 70,000,000 to $80,000,000 on railways; $25,000,000 for the re-establishment of soldiers in civilian life.Indemnity: Motion in the Commons. One of the Quebec members of the Dominion House of Commons (Mr. du Tremblay) lias given notice that he will move that Sir Robert Borden be instructed to claim an indemnity from Germany for Canada&apos;s war outlay, or to claim from the British Government a share of Great BritainVpart of the indemnity.Irish Canadians and Home Ride. At a large Irish meeting held at Ottawa last week a resolution was passed and forwarded to. Sir Robert Borden asking that he &quot; use his powerful influence with his colleagues at the Peace Conference to the end that the people of Ireland shall have a voice, in determining how they shall be governed and in framing and fashioning their own destiny.&quot;Western Grain Growers : Politics and, Tariffs. The Grain Growers&apos; Association decided at their Convention at Regina that as an Association they would not enter the political arena, but would provide facilities which would enable farmers in any Federal constituency in the Province to organise for the purpose of electing to -the House of Commons a representative prepared to support the farmers&apos;national political programme. In the opinion of the Convention Committee, it is undesirable that the Association be used as a distinct political organisation.The Grain Growers&apos; Association subsequently gave approval to the farmers&apos; platform as revised last November. This demanded practically unrestricted reciprocity between the Dominion and United States. Discussing the platform at the Convention, a delegate urged that the tariff against United States goods be gradually reduced until it stood at 10 per cent., in order to give some degree of protection to Canadian manufacturers, but the speaker was howled down by the Convention.A resolution demanding that the importation and sale of liquor be prohibited by Federal legislation was passed with one dissentient vote.Price of Wheat. The Grain Growers at the Convention referred to above adopted a resolution by a large majority asking the Government to fix the price of the wheat crop for 1919.&quot;Returned Soldiers and Land : Supply of Foodstuffs. The Canadian Minister of Agriculture (Mr. T. A. Crerar, ALP.), speaking at Montreal recently, gave an outline of the legislative proposals of the Government to assist returned soldiers to settle on the land. It is proposed to secure undeveloped land recently owned by individuals and corporations and situated near lines of railway. The Minister declared that the Government would assess a fair value on every acre of land in Canada, whether mineral, forest or agricultural, which is now-being held out of use through private ownership, and would tax it-accordingly. He added that the Dominion was in a good strategic position to supply foodstuffs to the world and was bound to develop enormously in agriculture.Housing Scheme. -The Dominion Governments housing scheme, under which a sum of $25,000,000 has been set aside for the use of the various Provincial Authorities, is receiving a good response throughout Canada. The necessary -machinery to develop the plan is now in process of construction by the Governments of the several Provinces, and it is hoped by the Federal Government that advantage will be taken of the loans soon enough to provide for starting building operations early in the coming-spring. It is hoped that the additional work arranged for in this way will be an important factor in the labour situation of the country.
Labour and Prohibition-The President of the Dominion Trades and Labour Congress (Mr. Tom Moore) addressed members of the Canadian Manufacturers&apos; Association at Montreal last week. He declared that the time had arrived, after all the sacrifices of the war, when the two great forces of labour and capital should get together and create a spirit of greater union than had prevailed in the past. &quot;The prohibitory measures which have recently been introduced into Canada,&quot; said Mr. Moore, &quot; have produced in the minds of working men much disquietude, and they feel that things to which they have been accustomed have been suddenly and arbitrarily taken away. T make this statement because I know that the workers of Canada want to be able to have light beer and wines as part of the solid enjoyment to which they are entitled. It is a remarkable feature that some of those who are preaching the doctrine of hard and fast prohibition are also preachers of Bolshevism and revolution.&quot;Quebec and&apos;Prohibition. It is stated in the Lobbies of the Quebec Provincial Legislature that a new Licence Bill is about to be presented by the Provincial Treasurer. The measure will provide for the taking of a referendum before May 1st next, in order to give the people an opportunity of choosing between total prohibition of liquor and the sale of light beers and wines.Canada Food Board. The statement of expense and revenue of the Canada Food Board, as given in the review of the Board&apos;s work for 1918, shows that the Board has a surplus of $39,751*19, due chiefly to the balance of revenue from licences. The total expenditure made by the Food Controller from July 1st, 1917, to January 31st, 1918, was S131,143&apos;34.Ontario and Women Members of Parliament. The Ontario Legislature are preparing to open the door to women members, and a Bill to this effect will be presented during this session. In connection with the right of women to sit in the Legislature it is also understood that the Government will extend the suffrage allowing women to hold municipal office on the same conditions as men.Other subjects introduced in the Speech from the Throne include housing and prohibition.AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH.Mr. Hughes and the Mandatory System in the Pacific. In the course of his speeches to the Australian troops in Belgium recently,&apos; Mr. Hughes is reported to have stated that in regard to German New Guinea and the other neighbouring islands, which had been captured by Australian troops, he had fought with all his might that they should be given outright to Australia. But he had fought against overwhelming opposition, and he had been defeated. The Peace Conference had decided upon the mandatory system. He would have had no objection to the islands being given to Great Britain, but if there was to be a mandate that mandate must he held by A australia. And Australia must have the same powers to make law for the ex-German colonies as she now had for the Commonwealth. It had been proposed that an open-door policy should be maintained in regard to those islands. He could not agree to &quot;that. There could be no open door in regard to the islands near Australia. There should be a barred and closed door, with Australia as the guardian of that door.   Nothing less would suffice.Influenza Epidemic. Telegrams of last week stated that the epidemic of pneumonic influenza was abating. Doctors were stated to be studying the effect of inoculation with a special Australian serum. The Melbourne Hospital reported that the experience of the medical and nursing staff showed that inoculation minimised the -complications and definitely loAvered the death rate.Commonwealth and South Africa: Trade and Shipping Matters. The Minister for Defence (Senator Pearce), while passing through South Africa en route to England, spoke at Pretoria on February 20th, and advocated more active commercial relations and the establishment of a fast steamer serAdce between Australia and South Africa, which he believed would be of the utmost advantage to both Dominions especially in
580regard to the.trade in perishable commodities. Speaking later at Kimberley, Senator Pearce said that with the advent of bigger ships, especially of those fitted with cold storage, he considered that trade by the Cape route would again come into its own, making the mutual interests of Australia and South Africa all the closer and keener.&apos; He forecasted the appointment of a representative to look after Australian trade interests in South Africa.Commonwealth Constitution. Referring to constitutional questions in the speech mentioned in the preceding paragraph, Senator Pearce said that the war had shown Australia the advantages of a more united system of government. He thought that many now desired a constitution more akin to that of South Africa, and that in any case there would be a close study of the South African legislative machine.It is announced in the Press that State Ministers have been discussing in Melbourne the necessity of refraining the Constitution. It was suggested that a Convention should meet to consider the question.NEW ZEALAND.Births and Deaths. The published figures for births and deaths in the Dominion during 1918 show considerable abnormality, due, it is stated, to the war and the influenza epidemic. The births numbered 25,687, the fewest since 1907, making a rate of 23 - 45 per 1,000, tke lowest recorded. There have been 16,364 deaths, the previous maximum being 10,596 in 1916. The deaths give a rate of 14&quot; 84 per 1,000, not exceeded since 1875.SOUTH AFRICA.Republicanism: Debate in House of Assembly. The debate on Sir Thomas Smartt&apos;s motion condemning Republican propaganda was continued in the Union House of Assembly on February 21st. The Transvaal Nationalist leader (Mr. Tielman Roos), in the course of a full statement of the Nationalist point of view, declared that, if the mission to Europe failed, they would go on agitating with a view to obtaining a majority in Parliament and gaining the independence of South Africa constitutionally. He denied the sanctity of the Act of Union, which he said merely perpetuated pre-Union conditions with the substitution of one Government under the British Crown for four Colonial Governments. Mr. Roos asked the Acting Premier whether the Government amendment (favouring the development of autonomy, while deprecating the present agitation and any tendency to outside interference) meant the granting of the fullest development under the British Crown. Mr. Malan replied in the affirmative.The debate was again adjourned until February 24th.On the resumption of the debate, Sir E. H. Walton emphasised that the Union was based on mutual faith and confidence. Notwithstanding recent events, he was still sure of the faith of the great majority of the Dutch-speaking people. Sir E. H. Walton complained that the Nationalists never faced the question of the attitude of the natives because they knew the natives were bitterly opposed to a Republican government. He declared that Great Britain could not relieve herself of her obligations as protector of the natives.Nationalist Deputation. At a meeting of Nationalist members of Parliament, held on February 20th, it was decided, according to a Reuter telegram of that date, to intimate to Admiral Fitzherbert their acceptance of his offer to convey the Nationalist deputation to England. However, a later message announced that at a party meeting held the next day the Nationalists reversed their decision to sail in the British cruiser Minerva. The reason given in Parliamentary circles for the Nationalists&apos; reversal of their former acceptance of the Admiral&apos;s offer was the increasing outcry from the country districts against the Nationalists travelling in a British warship. It is understood that the majority of the members of the deputation were anxious to sail in the Minerva, but the pressure of the older Nationalists became increasingly stronger, and the Nationalist caucus therefore became divided on the. subject.&apos; 7570-la B
The Nationalist official reason for not sailing in the Minerva was that there was not sufficient accommodation on board. A message from Simons Town stated that the Nationalist deputation visited the Minerva while she was coaling in a strong south-east wind, which afforded the worst possible conditions for an inspection.Railioay Budget. In the House of Assembly on February 2 ] st the Minister of Railways and Harbours (Mr. Burton), submitting the Railway Budget, stated that in spite of the effects of the influenza epidemic the railway receipts for 1918-19 were expected to amount to 650,0001. more than the original estimate and the harbour receipts to 103,000L more than estimated. The combined expenditure exceeded the estimate by 714,000/. and the net result of the working of the railways and harbours for 1918-19, was a deficit of 1,062,000/. which was being carried forward to the year 1919-20. However, notwithstanding the inclusion of this deficit Mr. Burton reckoned that the loss for 1919-20 would only be 877,0001., showing an improvement of 184,000Z. on the preceding year. The average weekly earnings in 1918-19 totalled 276,000/., and it was estimated that the average for 1919-20 would be 331,000/-., which had already been exceeded during the month of February.INDIA.(Excluding External Affairs, which are dealt w-ith in the Eastern Report.)Delegation of Moderates. It is announced that Mr. Surendranath Banerjee will preside over a delegation of Moderates who have been selected to proceed to England in order to promote the cause of Indian reforms. The delegation includes Sir Narayan Chan davarkar, Sir B. Mitter, Sir C. Semalvad, Sir Vithaldas Thackersey, Dr. Sapru,. Dr. Suhrawardv, Mr. Sastri, Mr. N. Samarth, Mr. C. Chintamani, Mr. P. Mitter,. Mr. Roy, Mr. it. Sahar, Mr. M. Shafi, Mr.&quot; M. Joshi, Mr. W. Chambers, and Pundit Kunzru.Sir Dinshaw Wacha condemned the suggestion that a Parliamentary Committee should be appointed on Indian reform as an unnecessary and uncalled-for waste of time, when Indians were anxious to see Bills pass both Houses at an early date for the advantage of England and India.FOREIGN COLONELS, &amp;c. IN AFRICA.GERMAN COLONIES.National Assembly and Return of Colonies. According to German Wireless of March 2nd, the National Assembly adopted a resolution, which was supported by all parties with the exception of the Independent Social Democrats, to the effect that Article 19 of the draft of the League of Nations relative to the German Colonies could not be reconciled with Point 5 of the Wilsonian programme regarding colonial conditions of peace. The Resolution continued : &quot; The National Assembly lodges the strongest protest against the one-sided alteration of those conditions, which were accepted by Germany and her Allies as the joint basis for peace, and demands the restoration to Germany of her colonial rights.&quot;The Imperial Colonial Minister, Dr. Bell, said : &quot; Germany&apos;s demand for the restoration of her colonial territory is irrefutable. Free from the lust of conquest and annexationist Imperialism, we demand our own colonial possessions, which we regard as being vitally necessary to a people of 70 millions. Our forcible exclusion from co-operation in the colonial sphere, which would involve an insufferable moral degradation for Germany, would be utterly irreconcilable with the world&apos;s peace and would be as great an injustice as the severing of our economic arteries by the stoppage
of colonial exports and imports which are necessary for the gradual restoration of)   our economic life . . . .&quot;&quot; I am confident that I am expressing the feelings not only of the National Assembly, but also of the whole German people, when I say that our urgent hope is that the colonial problem will be adjusted at the peace negotiations in the sense of the Wilsonian message of January 8th, 1918, which was accepted both by the Entente and by ourselves, and is in accordance with the standpoint of right and justice, and offers a guarantee for an unshakable League of Nations and the lasting peace of the world.&quot;German External Policy.&apos; In a Memorandum by the Political Intelligence Department of the Foreign Office, dated February 20th, 1919, attention is called to a lecture in Berlin by Adolf Grabowsky, one of the younger publicists who seems to command attention in Germany. In the course of the abridgment of the lecture the following passages occur in relation to colonial policy : If Germany develops all its cultural forces, it has a right to claim a share in developing the backward parts of the earth proportionate to its cultural power. If the League of Nations is a reality, it will have to assert the right of all civilised nations to have colonies. Especially must Germany not be passed over in the new partition of Africa.As a manufacturing State Germany needs foreign markets. This gives Germany a right to oversea trade. If the League of Nations is a reality, the supply of raw materials must be regulated by international agreement, the most-favoured-nation clause must be made general, and there must be universal freedom of trade. - This means that the freedom of the seas must he recognised, always provided that account is taken of the special necessities of England.Emigration from Germany on a large scale is inevitable under the hard economic conditions of the near future.
