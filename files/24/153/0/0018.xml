SECRET.APPRECIATION OF THE ATTACHED REPORT No. 112.BRITISH  EMPIRE  AND AFRICA.Canada.The tariff question is becoming one of acute controversy. The announcement that there will be a general revision of the tariff directly normal conditions are restored may help to steady the conflicting claims of East and West.The estimated population of the Dominion, as not far short of 9,000,000, shows a large increase over.the census results of 1911.The year&apos;s estimates provide some interesting figures.The financial claims against the enemy have been announced by the Enemy Debts Committee.The &quot; one big Union &quot; scheme for the Dominion is receiving support in the West. This proposal has, of course, a distinct Bolshevik flavour.Australian Commonwealth.Mr. Hughes has made clear the desires of the Commonwealth as to the control of Nauru. It should be remembered that the phosphates in this island are essential to the agricultural interests of Australia.It is of interest to note that a tariff revision is to take place.The responsible leaders of Labour are repudiating Bolshevik tendencies and the &quot; one big Union &quot; movement.Sooth Africa.The Union Ministers have indicated their desire that immediate progress may be made in settling the main principles of Imperial Defence as applicable to South Africa.The Bill dealing with enemy aliens is of importance. It will, no doubt, be strenuously opposed by the Nationalists.Other Colonies, Protectorates, &amp;c.The latest telegrams from Egypt show that the situation has considerably improved. The native police and army have happily contributed much to the maintenance of order. In Cairo the students from the schools and the University of El Azhar seem to have been the material on which the Nationalist agitators have chiefly worked. Alexandria has been less disturbed than was to be expected. Again in Tanta, a hotbed of fanaticism, serious trouble does not appear to have occurred. It is, however, in the Provinces, where it is so difficult to exercise an adequate control, that the most violent outbreaks have happened. The systematic attack on communications demonstrated the existence of a carefully prepared organisation. Generally speaking, the state of affairs in the Delta is better, except in the Northern districts. The Bedouin incursions into the Western districts show the usual readiness of these people to seize any opportunity of marauding expeditions. Reports from Upper Egypt have revealed a more serious state of affairs, but until communications are fully restored it is not possible to estimate the damage.H. d&apos;E.March 27th, 1919.

BRITISH   EMPIRE   AND   AFRICA  REPORT.SELF-GOVERNING   DOMINIONS.CANADA.Tariff Questions. :At a caucus meeting of Unionist supporters of the Government held last week at Ottawa, the question of tariffs was discussed. It was afterwards announced that there would he a general revision of the tariff as soon as normal conditions are restored in Canada. The revision will be carried out after enquiry by the Finance Minister, assisted by members representing the East and the West, and after all the business and commercial interests have been given a full opportunity of presenting their grievances to the Government.During the debate in Parliament Colonel J. A. Currie insisted that the protective system should be maintained, in contradistinction to Mr. J. A. Maharg, President of the Saskatchewan Grain Growers, who on the previous day demanded an immediate and substantial reduction in the Customs tariff. The latter argued that the AVest had been prepared to support the Union Government during the progress of the war and to place the tariff issue on one side, but now it was determined to secure concessions. -At a later sitting an Opposition amendment to the motion of the Acting Prime Minister (Sir T. White) to go into Committee of Supply was moved by Mr. McMaster, and this called for the repeal of the War Tariffs Act of 1915, which imposed an additional duty of 5 per cent, ad valorem on all commodities coming into Canada from Britain and of 1\ per cent, on all commodities entering from other countries; the immediate adoption of the Reciprocity Agreement with the United States, which was rejected by the people in 1911 ; the abolition of duties on staple foodstuffs and domestic animals coining from countries which admit similar Canadian articles free of duty; the placing on the free list of farm and garden implements, machinery and tools, including farm tractors, all mining, flour and sawmill machinery and repair parts, as well as lubricating fuel and oils, cement and fertilisers.Sir Thomas White, in replying, pointed out that the amendment amounted to a declaration of want of confidence in the Government, and if carried it meant the, defeat of the Government. He then expressed confidence that the announcements to be made in the Budget Speech, probably early in April, would commend themselves to the majority of the members of the House and the people of the country.Mr. T. A. Crerar said that he did not disguise the fact that he always believed in a low tariff policy for the Dominion.Mr. F. B. Carvell stated that regardless of any opinion he held on the tariff question he would support the Union Government until demobilisation was completed. He considered it little short of a crime to bring on a general election at this time.Dr. Michael Clark (Red Deer) accused the Opposition of forgetting the problems of demobilisation and reconstruction in their eagerness to &quot;play purely a party game.&quot;At the end of the debate the first division of the present Session occurred, when 61 members were in favour of the amendment and 115 against. All the Liberal-Unionists voted against the amendment, including Mr. W. S. Fielding. Two Liberals voted against their party.The Years Estimates. On March 20th the main estimates for the fiscal year commencing April 1st were tabled in the House of Commons by Sir Thomas White. The estimated expenditure is $437,679,071, an increase of j $137,996,832 on the previous year. These estimates are exclusive of war expenditure, which is covered by a special vote. Railway expenditure is estimated at $50,896,681, which is an increase of $23,000,000 over the expenditure for the current year. The amount provided for pensions is $30,000,000, an increase of $14,000,000.
The vote for the laud settlement of soldiers totals $25,000,000, while for the Department of Soldiers&apos; Civil Re-establishment a sum of -$22,763,420 is set aside.Claims against the Enemy. Canadian claims against individuals and corporations for indebtedness and property held in enemy countries, as reported to the Enemy Debts Committee, total $1,525,000. Claims against enemy Governments for damages due to&apos; illegal methods of warfare total $30,000,000. Canadians owe the enemy nations $1,660,000, and enemy property held in Canada has a total value of $38,000,000.On the motion in Parliament of Mr. dn Tremblay (vide Report No. 109) the Acting Prime Minister (Sir T. White) said he had grave doubts as to the possibility of collecting from Germany the full amount of the Avar expenditure of the Allies. &quot;He expressed confidence that if Germany was found able to pay an indemnity, Canada would be placed in precisely the same position as Britain and the other Allies.Mr. Lemieux on Liberal Policy. Speaking in Parliament last week, Mr. Rodolphe Lemieux said there had been a &quot; Quebec situation,&quot; but time was a great healer, and already)&apos; there were signs that the estrangement between Quebec and the other Provinces was &quot;coming to an end. He said that the Liberal Party could agree with the farmers&apos; platform; although differences and distinctions&apos; existed, they were onlv slight ones. He announced himself to be a Canadian, placing the programme of Canada first. &quot; When I say I am a Canadian,&quot; Mr. R. Lemieux explained, &quot; I speak as a Britisher, and am not suggesting independence or annexation.&quot; He predicted that a great nationality would arise in Canada.After Mr. Reid had spoken, the debate on the Address closed, and the House proceeded to consider Government Bills.Labour and &quot;One Big Union&apos;&quot; Proposal.--The Vancouver Trades and Labour Council have endorsed by an overwhelming majority the principles for the formation of &quot; one big union &quot; for the whole of Canada, and the severance of relations with international unions.This programme was initiated and endorsed recently at Calgary by the Western Labour Conference, consisting of representatives from all the Unions in Western Canada. The Western Labour Conference also sent felicitations to the Bolsheviks in Russia and the Spartacists in Germany. This action, too, was endorsed by the Vancouver Council.Population of the Dominion. Replying to a question, Mr. Arthur Meighen stated in the House of Commons last week that the estimated population of the Dominion was 8,835,000. The figures at the last census in 1911. showed the population to be 7.206,643. Therefore the number of people in the Dominion has increased by 1,628,357 in the last eight years.Grand Trunk Pacific. Legislation which aims at giving Parliamentary assent to the appointment of a Receiver of the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway was introduced in the Iiouse of Commons last week by the Acting Prime Minister (Sir Thomas White). The Minister explained that this action was taken by the Cabinet when they were informed that the railway was unable to continue beyond March 10th. It was decided that great inconvenience would be caused if the railway was allowed to cease operation, so the Cabinet promptly decided to apply the powers of the War Measures Act. He could not state definitely the future policy, but he could assure the House that it would be in the best interests of the country. He outlined the past conferences between the Government and the representatives of the Grand Trunk regarding the possibility of taking over the Grand Trunk Pacific and the Grand Trunk itself. There was a considerable difference of opinion between the Government and the directors regarding the amount to be paid in annual rental for the older road.Sir Thomas White asserted that the Grand Trunk was responsible for the fixed charges, but stated that there was no desire on the part of the Government to exact its &quot; pound of flesh &quot; in connection with the Grand Trunk, with whom, nevertheless, the future action depended. The present legislation w-as necessary, he explained, because the powers of the Exchequer Court were insufficient to appoint a Receiver in the case of a railwa3r system of this magnitude. He said that the policy of the Government was not &quot;to give further aid under present conditions, and asserted that the attitude of the Grand Trunk directors was unreasonable because they refused to recognise the just liabilities of the Grand Trunk Pacific towards the Government-
The Grand Trunk wanted the Government to relieve them of the incubus of the whole transcontinental system from Moncton to Prince Rupert. At the end of a keen debate the resolution was carried.Cable from Vancouver to Australia. The Dominion Minister of Immigration and Colonisation reports that Canadian and United States business interests are Urging the construction of a duplicate cable from Vancouver to Australia. The &quot;existing cable is considerably overtaxed by the present business.Value of Farm Lands. The average value of Canadian farm lands in 1918 was the highest yet recorded, according to a Report issued recently by the Dominion Bureau of Statistics. The average value of farm land, including improved and unimproved land and buildings, was $46 per acre, as against $44 in 1917.International Exposition. The question of the establishment of a great Inter-national Exposition in Canada, with headquarters at Montreal, has been raised in the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Quebec, and the Prime Minister (Sir Lomer Gouin) has expressed his sympathy with the proposal.Sir Lonier Gouin and the Dominion Cabinet. La Tribune, a newspaper published at Sherbrooke, Quebec, states that before June next Sir Lomer Gouin, the Premier of Quebec, will enter the Federal Cabinet.AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH.Covenant of the League of Nations. The Prime Minister of the Commonwealth (Mr. Hughes) has circulated a Memorandum entitled &quot;Notes on the Covenant&quot; (W.C.P. 346)!Control of Nauru.-The Prime Minister of the Commonwealth (Mr. Hughes) has circulated a Memorandum (W.C.P. 345); which states that since the circulation of his previous Memorandum (W.C.P. 240) relating to the future of Nauru (vide Report No. Ill under &quot; Imperial * Affairs &quot;) he has received a further telegram from his Government strongly emphasising the desire of Australia that the island of Nauru should be under the control or mandate of the Commonwealth. Mr. Hughes refers to the arguments in support of the claim put forward in his previous Memo-randum, and especially to the fact that the island was captured and held by australian -lian naval and military forces, and that it is the only one of all the captured islands from which the returns will exceed the expense of administration.Parliament and League of Nations. It is announced that the Commonwealth Government have decided to consult Parliament before finally agreeing to incor-poration in the League of Nations.Tariff Revision. The Acting Prime Minister (Mr. Watt) has announced that early next session the Government will undertake a revision of the Tariff.Recruits for the Navy and Naval Policy. It is stated in the Press that the Naval Department is hoping to attract crews for Australian warships by offering pay equal to 31. a week. Recruits are not forthcoming, and it has been publicly suggested that a way out of the difficulty is not to commission some of the destroyers and submarines recently presented to the Commonwealth.The Press is urging that Mr. Hughes should clearly define the proposed future naval policy that is to accompany the control of new possessions in the Pacific.Cause of Declining Birth Rate. Official statistics which have recently been published show that the declining birth rate is, in a large degree, attributable to the fashion of late marriages. Of 1,000 women married in Victoria in 1918, only 496 were under 25 years of age, as compared with an average of 642 per 1,000 for the previous decade.Labour leaders and Bolshevism. Mr. Storey, the State Labour leader, speaking on behalf of the New South Wales Federal and State Labour members, has, according to published reports, repudiated any sympathy with the methods of the Bolsheviks and Spartacists. The &quot; One Big Union &quot; advocates were not entitled, he said, to speak for the Australian Labour movement, and the efforts of a number of men to reorganise trade unionism must not be confounded with the constitutional foundation of the Labour Party.
The Acting Premier of Queensland (Mr. Theodore) has endorsed Mr. Storey&apos;s &quot;challenge to the extremists. Mr. Theodore regards Mr. Storey&apos;s utterances as wise and timely, and says that the recognised Labour movement must make a definite stand through its accredited leaders and elected executives.Labour Proposals. The proposals of the New South Wales Labour members for submission to the Inter-State Labour Conference iu June include a Commonwealth guarantee against unemployment, compulsory voting and a 30-hours&apos; week for miners.Bolshevism. The Social Democratic League of New South Wales declares its aims to be identical with those of the Bolshevik and Spartacist movements, which, it declares, &quot;stand for emancipation from serfdom and wage-slavery.&quot;SOUTH AFRICA.Imperial Defence. The Union Ministers have informed the. British Government that their attention has been directed to the future naval and military defence of the South African coast and&apos; harbours, and ocean trade routes round Southern Africa. It is recognised that this matter forms part of the&apos; larger problem of Imperial Defence, and that any scheme must depend on the nature of the Peace Settlement and the international position, but the Ministers assume that the whole question will necessarily be reconsidered in the light of the new conditions brought about by the war, especially by the defeat of Germany and the removal of the menace associated with German colonisation. The Ministers therefore have expressed their hope that the British Government will utilise the advantage of the presence in London of the Prime Minister of the Union and the Minister of Defence to discuss those aspects of naval and military defence which are particularly applicable to the Union. In view of the importance to the Union of the consideration of questions of policy and finance, the Ministers hope that a discussion of the kind suggested may take place at the earliest moment at which the British Government think it probable that a settlement can be arrived at consistent with general security.Enemy Aliens. The British Government have been informed by the Governor-General of South Africa that the Union Ministers have introduced into Parliament a Bill providing for the repatriation of enemy subjects, who, being interned in the Union, (1) have asked to be repatriated, (2) have not acquired domicile in the Union, (3) have during the war shown themselves hostile to the Allied cause. The proposed legislation will also provide for the denaturalisation of British subjects of enemy origin who/being interned in the Union, (1) have expressed a desire to revert to their former nationality, (2) have during the present war shown themselves hostile to the Allied cause. Persons so denaturalised wrould also be repatriated. The Bill makes provision for an advisory Board of. Appeal, the final decision resting with the Minister of the Interior.It having been reported to the Union Ministers that the Government of the Australian Commonwealth have released from internment all German prisoners of war, the Union Ministers enquire whether this is correct, and whether the Common-wealth Government intend to introduce legislation similar to that outlined above. If this is not contemplated, the Union Ministers wish to know the policy that it is proposed to adopt in connection with alien enemies.The Nationalists have indicated their intention of opposing the passage of the Bill dealing with enemy aliens, and, according to Press announcements, they have already lodged petitions against the Bill. On the other hand, it is reported that a section . of people, mainly in Natal and the Eastern parts of the Cape Province, regard the provisions of the Bill as lacking in stringency.Budget Debate : League of Nations and Labour Unrest. On the resumption of the debate on the Budget, Mr. Patrick Duncan contested Mr. Merriman&apos;s views on the League of Nations, whereupon Mr. Merriman interjected: &quot;It is as dead as mutton.&quot; Mr. Duncan described the functions of the League as being essentially an interference in the private affairs of nations to compel them to settle their differences otherwise than b3^ violence or war. Europe, he declared, had failed to keep the peace owing to its reluctance to interfere, and to the absence of any international organisation strong7570 -4a B
-enough to forward its interests. Mr. Duncan was not over sanguine regarding the practical results of a League of Nations, hut he considered the proposal was never-theless a basis on which to settle an age-long difficulty. Discussing the labour unrest, the speaker emphasised the fact that although the country would never be free from labour troubles, they should not make matters worse by a slavish adherence to the prejudices of the past.Speaking in the Union House of Assembly on March 10th, the Leader of the Opposition (Sir T. Smartt), drew- the attention of the House to the way in which the Nationalist newspapers had incited the Dutcli members of the defence force not to fire on the strikers in the event of tire military being called out. The Minister of Defence (Colonel Mentz) replied that the Government were determined to maintain law and order and to preserve life and property.   &quot;Replying to the Leader of the Labour Party (Colonel Creswell), the Acting-Premier stated that he had given instructions that a warning and an appeal should be issued to all concerned in the strike to maintain law and order and to confine the dispute to the parties actually concerned.Strike Progress. In the Union House of Assembly, on March 13th, the Acting-Prime Minister announced that the Pretoria tram strike had been settled.The building trade delegates of the South African Industrial Federation rejected the recommendation made by the building trades joint board and decided, on March 13th, to adhere to their original demand for a 44 hours&apos; week at the rate of 3s. 5c?. per hour.INDIA.Legislation on Sedition Committee Report. The report of the Select Committee on the Pill providing for an amendment of the Penal Code and the Code of Criminal Procedure, shows that the Government have agreed to the elimination of the clause making the unlawful possession of a seditious document with intent to publish punishable by two years&apos; imprisonment.In the debate on the introduction of the Bill the Legal Member emphasised the importance of preventing the mischief caused by the dissemination of such documents among the youthful and impressionable public.Mr. Banerjee, Mr. Sastri, and Mr. Shall, the three Moderates, have signed the report, but have published a minute of dissent in Avhich they state that their objection to the principles underlying the Bill still remains. The three Extremist members withdrew from the Committee at an early stage.Indian Seditionists. In order to prevent Indian seditionists from returning to Japan, British representatives in America have been instructed to cause the passports of Indians known to be seditious, whether resident in the United States, Mexico or elsewhere, to be endorsed to the effect that the passport is valid only for a continuous journey to a specific British port and is issued subject to the condition that the bearer does not break his journey on the way.OTHER COLONIES, PROTECTORATES, &amp;c.EGYPT.Development of the Situation.&apos;- Telegraphing on March 19th, Sir M. Cheetham reported that the Provinces of Behera, Gharbia, Menulia and Dakahlia were in open revolt, and that senior police officers had been hilled in other places, while railway stations had been sacked and burnt. News had been received from Beni Suef, where a detachment of Indian troops was besieged by Bedouins, that a train had come in from the South in which were found the naked bodies of six murdered British officers, and that at Cairo it was reported that the El Azhar leaders were trying to induce the Coptic Patriarch and community to join the movement actively. -Sir M. Cheetham reported on March 19th that General Bulfin had paid an official visit to the Sultan and explained that he had the forces necessary to repress the
agitation, but that from the extension of the outbreak no repression would be effective unless of the severest kind. The Sultan enquired whether some action could be obtained from London which would prevent this calamity. Sir M. Cheetham added that the present movement is anti-British, anti-Sultanian and anti-Foreign, and has a Bolshevik tendency. .-On March 20tir it was reported that the Commander-in-Chief had repeated the warning addressed to the Sultan, and asked for the help of Egyptian public men in restoring tranquillity, stating his intention to stamp out terrorism at all costs. The leaders showed no signs of abating their demands, though they were understood to be nervous and anxious. The Egyptian officials in Cairo were stated to be behaving satisfactorily, but those in the Provinces, if not terrorised, had no influence.The Foreign Office instructed Sir M. Cheetham that the first consideration was to restore law and order, and that if any proposals were made to him from responsible quarters, he should state that they could not be expected to receive consideration until after law and order had been entirely re-established.On March 20th Sir M. Cheetham reported that British refugees from Beni Suef had reached Cairo the night before, and had reported a very serious situation from the 14th to the 16th. The Bedouins were using firearms, including Mausers. In Menufia, Gharbia, Behera and Dakahiia anarchy was still rife, and North Gharbia was cut off by rail and telephone.The Foreign Office informed Sir M. Cheetham on March 21st that General Allen by was. on his way to Egypt, and that he should inform the Sultan that in view of the grave situation, and in the absence of the High Commissioner, the King had appointed General Allenby to be His Majesty&quot;s special High Commissioner for Egypt and the Sudan, with supreme authority in all military and civil matters.On March 22nd serious rioting was reported to have taken place four days before in practically all the towns and villages between Minia and Deraw. The damage done at Zagazig was stated to have affected Greek shops exclusively, but he said that the conditions of the town were reported as becoming normal.On March 22nd Sir M. Cheetham reported that a number of Egyptian notables of good standing, including a number of wealthy landowners from Upper Egypt, had approached the Residency to express their anxiety to see a solution of the question. The evidence showed the growth of more moderate influence.On the evening of March 22nd a telegram from Sir M. Cheetham stated that four days before, the railway, telegraph, and telephone wires were cut at Assuan, and the mob locked the Mudir in his house and closed the Court.On March 23rd Wasta town and district &quot;was reported qxuet, the police having behaved excellently. The day had been quiet at Cairo. At Zagazig it was reported that the Nationalist Committee had declared a Republic.On the same date the vigorous language and action of the Commander-in-Chief was stated to have had a reassuring effect, and that discouragement was visible amongst the extremists. In certain districts the movement had the character of a peasants&apos; rising against landlords. On the same date Sir M. Cheetham reported that the Ministry of the Interior was working in close touch with General Headquarters where intelligence was centred and that other officials were placed at the disposal of the Commander-in-Chief in order to strengthen the military staff, to provide a civil adviser at each occupied town and to attach to each body of troops moving in the delta au Englishman speaking Arabic and with local knowledge.A telegram of March 24th indicated that the Assuan dam had not been touched, and that while occasional disturbances had occurred south of Cairo, conditions on the whole were quieter. The evacuation of Europeans was proceeding satisfactorily, and in some cases Egyptian troops were being used for this purpose. Cairo was reported quiet, though the original extremist leaders were not yet able to face the loss of prestige involved by unconditional surrender.A telegram of March 27th conveyed the information that order was spreading southwards, that evacuated police outposts in the Fayoum had been re-occupied, and that railway communication with Assuan and telegraphic communication with Haifa had been re-established.
