BRITISH  EMPIRE   AND   AFRICA  REPORT.IMPERIAL AFFAIRS.British Empire Delegation. At meetings of the British Empire Deleo-ation held on May 30th, 1919 (B.E.10^ 32),&apos; and on June 1st, 1919 (B.E.D. 33), the German observations on Peace conditions were discussed.SELF-GOVERNING   DOMINIONS.CANADA.Labour Troubles. The Winnipeg strike is still unsettled, although many strikers have gone back to work. Sympathetic strikes have now begun at Calgary and Edmonton, while the Unions at Toronto and Regina have also voted for a general strike. The President, &quot;Vice-President and Secretary of the Toronto Trades and Labour Council have resigned as a protest against the extreme proposals of the Strike Committee. Tke retiring officers represent the party which is opposed to the &quot;One Big Union&quot; idea. The leaders of the Toronto strikers are in alliance with the Winnipeg Strike leaders.Replying tp a question in the House of; Commons by the Opposition Leader, the Prime Minister (Sir Robert Bordenk after announcing that a conference was to be held between the workers, employers and the Government in the hopes of the arrival at a settlement of the Toronto situation, made the following statement:-&quot; A great many proposals have been brought forward, with the final result that the employers made a proposition in writing which was to be submitted by the repre-sentatives of labour organisations to their men in Toronto. I believe it was so presented, but labour did not see fit to accept it.&quot; The chief question at issue was that of a 44-hour week, and on this point the employers finally decided to offer arbitration.&quot;At Winnipeg, the metal trades employers offered to discuss labour problems with the striking employees, with the Canadian Railway Brotherhood members as mediators. Large numbers of civic employees have returned to work or have applied for reinstatement, and the striking postal clerks have returned to their positions.The Edmonton street car service has been resumed, and reports from Calgary indicate that business is practically normal. At Moose Jaw the motion in favour of a sympathetic strike was withdrawn, and action was deferred pending a discussion with the City Council. Police and fire protection throughout the West is practically as usual.Naval Policy. The Canadian Minister of Marine (Mr. C. C. Ballantyne, M.P.) announces that the Dominion Government will next Session introduce a new Naval Policy.Liberal Convention. With the consent of the Liberal Advisory Committee, the Opposition Leader (Mr. D. D, Mackenzie) has appointed a National Liberal Convention Committee which will arrange the necessary preliminary details for the. Liberal Convention in August. The Committee is composed of Mr. D. D. Mackenzie, Senators Bostock, Edwards and Belcourt, and 11 members from the House of Commons. In addition, the Committee will also include the seven Liberal Provincial Premiers and the Opposition Leaders of Prince Edward Island and Ontario.Unionist Organisation. It is reported from Ottawa that a movement for the consolidation of the Unionist Party on broader lines is expected before the termination of the present session. It is felt that the serious problems confronting the country daily, the burden of debt, and the perplexity of the general outlook call for a maximum of union and a minimum of politics.Quebec General Election. The Quebec Legislature has been dissolved, and the Provincial General Election is fixed for June 23rd. .Overseas War Effort: Future of Air Force. The Dominion Minister of Overseas Military Forces (Sir Edward Kemp)&apos;gave a summary of the work of his department
o Oto the House of Commons last week. When war was declared, Sir E. Kemp said, Canada plunged into the conflict on the basis of &quot; The last man and the last dollar.&quot; At that time it was thought that 50,000 men would be adequate, but a total of 420,913 men finally answered the call and served overseas.Sir Edward thought it advisable to maintain the present existing Canadian Air Force in two squadrons, as Canadians had proved unbeatable airmen. The British Government were presenting Canada with 93 aeroplanes, and the Dominion would also receive about 80 German machines. In addition, 50 Curtiss planes now in the country had been retained.AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH. -Meeting of Parliament.- The Commonwealth Parliament will re-open on June 25th.Industrial Troubles. The Acting Prime Minister (Mr. Watt), speaking recently at a political meeting, referred to industrial troubles, and said they showed that the Arbitration Law had either failed or that there was a substantial section of indus-industrialists who were determined to have the double weapon of resort to Courts, and if they failed to get all their demands, also to strike. The political victories which established the Arbitration Courts had been won by Unions of skilled trades, but the fruits had been gathered by unskilled labour which had swamped the Craft Unions, and decreased the margin of wages between skilled and unskilled labour&apos;until it was scarcely worth while to learn trades. Skilled workmen were now being classed with capitalists and attacked. The Craft Unions observed- the law ; the leaders of the unskilled labourers were determined to break down legal methods of settlement of disputes with a definite Bolshevik objective. He urged the public and the Press to resist the dangerous movement, otherwise insidious forces present would plunge Australia into political and industrial turbulence.Seamen s Strike, The seatnen&apos;s strike continues. The Arbitration Court has ordered a plebiscite of ail members of the Seamen&apos;s Union on the question-as to whether the strike should continue.Trade Commissioner for United States. Mr. Mark Sheldon, Vice-President of the Chamber of Commerce in Sydney, has been appointed Australian Trade Commissioner to the United States.   He sails at the end of July.Lord, Jcllicoe in Victoria. S.M.S. New Zealand anchored in Port Phillip on May 30th and Lord Jellicoe landed at St. Kilda the following day amid general rejoicings. He approached the city through the broad avenue of St. Kilda Road, which was thronged with cheering crowds, and entered the city proper over Prince&apos;s Bridge, where dense crowds cheered him. Lord Jellicoe was received by the Lord Mayor and welcomed by the Acting Prime Minister. The main streets were lavishly beflagged and decorated.SOUTH AFRICA.Finance of the Union. In introducing the Loan Estimates in the Union House of Assembly on May 29th the Finance Minister (Sir T. Orr) gave figures showing that the total revenue on Loan Account for the year 1918-19 amounted to 10,033,0007-., whilst expenditure was 8,083,000L, leaving a balance in hand of 1,950,0007. Sir T. Orr estimated the revenue for the year 1919-20, with the balance brought forward from the previous year, at 3,642,000Z., and the expenditure at 10,105,0007., leaving a total of 6,463,0001. to be raised. In connection with War Expenditure the capital liability of the Union on account of Imperial advances totalled 16,630,0007.Anti-Bolshevik Measures. The Bill extending the operation of the Public Welfare Act, which was read a first time in the Union House of Assembly on May 22iid, contains important amendments directed againt Bolshevism. It prohibits the publication of matter, or membership of associations advocating violence for the purpose of effecting changes in political, industrial, or economic conditions, or the publication of matter inciting natives. It also provides for the registration and identification of aliens.Future of South-West Africa.-Jn the House of Assembly on May 30th the Acting Prime- Minister (Mr. Malan) in reply to a suggestion that German South-WestS19i-la A 2
Africa should, be opened to prospecting and settlement, especially with a view to the employment of returned soldiers, said that the Government would submit a Bill, but not this session, to give effect to the principles of the mandate conferred by the League of Nations and to provide a civil Government. It might be necessary to call a special session to deal with the matter. It would, he added, have been inadvisable during the war to allow people to prospect and settle, but perhaps the time would come to permit mineral prospecting. The Government, however, had allowed permits from a magistrate to visit the country for the purpose of spying out the land for settlement. Also the survey of farm land had been continued. It was a very fine, big territory. A great deal of land had, Mr. Malan said, been held by companies, ancl the Com-missioner was going into the titles of these companies and concessions, so that when the time came the Government would have all the necessary information before it.It is announced in the Press that Parliament will probably be prorogued at the end of June, but that it will reassemble in special session in October to consider the Peace settlement and to pass, the Bill foreshadowed by Mr. Malan.Labour Party and Price of Necessaries.-A crowded and.enthusiastic public meeting held recently at the City Hall, Cape Town, under the auspices of the Labour Party, urged the Government to fix the prices of necessaries, to compel the limitation of profits, and also to fix rents on a fair basis ancl to assist in municipal housing schemes. The Leader of the Labour Party (Colonel Creswell) and Messrs. Boydell and Sampson, Members of the House of Assembly, strongly appealed for reforms owing to the high cost of living.Indian Trading and Land- Ownership. In the Committee stage of the Bill dealing with the ownership and occupation of land and trading by Asiatics in the proclaimed mining areas of the Transvaal further lengthy discussion took place. Amendments were moved for the non-recognition of any rights acquired since the Smuts-Gandhi agreement of 1914 ancl for the extension of the trading restrictions to the whole province. The Leader of the Opposition (Sir Thomas Smartt) and Mr. Merriman deprecated what they described as the anti-Indian attitude of Sir Abe Bailey and others, Sir Thomas Smartt dwelling on the co-operation of the Indians in the war and Mr. Merriman urging the desirability of preserving the goodwill of the Asiatic races. The Minister of Justice (Mr. N. J. de Wet) pointed out that Asiatic trading had hitherto not been restricted. The debate was adjourned, and on the resumption later the main point at issue was whether the proposed restriction of trading licences was to elate from 1919, as provided in the Bill, or from 1914 when the agreement between General Smuts and Mr. Gandhi was effected. An amendment in the latter sense was rejected by 49 votes to 37. Supporters of the amendment urged that the India invasion of South Africa already gravely threatened parts of the Union as a &quot; white man&apos;s &quot; Country owing to Indians underselling Europeans, ancl contended that the issue of licences since 1914 was an evasion of the Smuts-Gandhi agreement. The Acting Premier (Mr. Malan) pointed out that the Smuts-Gandhi agreement had not the force of law ancl that a number of Indians, while they had not broken the law, had broken the spirit of the agreement... Mr-. Malan also pointed out that Indians who had obtained licences since 1914 had not obtained them in contravention of the law, and he urged that in view of the huge coloured populations the House should act with meticulous justice. He feared the amendment might be considered an injustice in view of the circumstances, ancl finally announced that a commission would be appointed during the recess to enquire into the whole question.A new clause was moved by Mr. Collins (Ministerialist), giving any issuing authority in any part of the Transvaal the right to refuse trading licences to Asiatics without reason assigned. The clause was strongly supported by the Transvaal members but was opposed by the Government. Nevertheless the clause was adopted by 45 votes to 31. On the clause prohibiting future ownership of land by companies in which Asiatics held a controlling interest Mr. Papenfus moved an amendment, the effect of which would be to prohibit the existing ownership by such companies. Sir Abe Bailey moved an amendment rendering illegal a transfer of land by such companies to other companies in which Asiatics held a third interest.The Bill emerged from Committee with amendments prohibiting the holding of mortgages by Asiatics on property except as security for a bond fide loan, or investment, ancl providing that any Asiatic company, which acquired fixed property after the 1st instant should dispose of the same within two years, or a further period as fixed by a. competent court, with a rider that in the event of failure to do so the property might-be sold by order of the Court.   A further amendment dating the operation of the
proposal from the date of the Smuts-Ghandi agreement was rejected by 53 to 29 votes.Gold Mines and Coloured Labour. In the Onion House of Assembly, replying to a suggestion by Mr. Jagger, that with a view to averting the closing down of a number of Transvaal gold mines, the colour bar (involving the restriction of all stilled and semi-skilled occupations to whites) should be abolished, Sir Abe Bailey declared that the white population on the Witwatersrand was averse to the abolition. The Minister of Railways and Harbours (Mr. Burton) recognised that the question of&apos; coloured labour was one of necessarily increasing difficulty. The coloured bar was causing resentment among the coloured population. He recognised the seriousness of the situation for the gold industry but there was no royal road to a solution which would be gradual. Therefore he earnestly appealed to the co-operation of the Labour Party, otherwise they were approaching a precipice. Speaking later, the Labour leader (Colonel Creswell) strongly advocated a white South Africa as the only solution embodying permanence. He declared that in view of the numbers of soldiers returning from the war and the difficulties of finding work, it would be a calamity if any mine closed, and it would be a crime if any were unnecessarily shut down. The Acting Prime Minister (Mr. Malan) said that inasmuch as the Government recognised the importance of consulting the workers he suggested the constitution of a corn-mission composed of three workers and three employers and three representatives of the Government. It was proposed that mines could be compeUed to continue working on this Commission^ recommendation. Among the remedies proposed for the present situation were, firstly, the Imperial Government had been asked to endeavour to obtain a refund of the accumulated insurance on shipments of gold ; secondly, permission to ship gold direct to America ; and, thirdly, the establishment of a gold refinety and mint in-South Africa capable of supplying other countries.INDIA.Famine. In a telegram dated 30th May the Viceroy reported to the India Office that scarcity had been declared in the Sakoli Tahsil of Bhandara district, Central Provinces. Distress was stated to be still severe in the affected tracts of Etawah and increasing in Mirzapur and Moradabad districts of the United Provinces, but the agricultural prospects in those provinces were reported favourable. The number on relief was also increasing in Bundelkhand Agency, Central India. The numbers relieved were as follows : Bengal : (incomplete figures; ; test works, 966. Bihar and Orissa : relief works, 3,165 ; test works, 5,097 ; gratuitous relief, 10,907. Feudatory States, Orissa: test works, 20,586 ; gratuitous relief, 16,103.
