SECRET,APPRECIATION  OK THE ATTACHED REPORT No. 138.BRITISH  EMPIRE  AND AFRICA.This is the last issue of the    British Empire and Africa&quot; Report in itspresent form..        Canada.The holding of the Industrial Conference has marked an important stage in the development of co-operation between Capital and Labour. Though failing to reach agreement on some important points, such as an eight-hours day and collective bargaining by unions, the Conference came to some useful decisions on other matters.The proceedings at the Trades and Labour Congress are important and will show how far the One Big Union advocates will receive support.The War expenditure of the Dominion is still considerable.The development of the Dominion as a manufacturing country is emphasised by the latest order from Greece secured by the Trade Mission.Changes now being effected in the political complexion of certain Provinces will afford an indication of tendencies in the wider spheres of Dominion politics,Australian Commonwealth.The telegram from the Prime Minister as to safeguards in the event of the ultimate incorporation of mandated territory, and as to the right of entry of missionaries, indicates a desire to be protected against possible Japanese action in the Pacific.The Federal House of Representatives have approved the Peace Treaty. The Official Labour criticism is apparently designed to appeal inter alia to the natural Australian prejudice against Asiatics.The telegram from Mr. Hughes regarding a new contract for meat supplies touches upon an important aspect of the policy of Imperial Preference.New Zealand.The Budget contains some interesting items, including the Estimated cost of Samoan administration.It seems that the amount of gratuities to soldiers is being made a Party question. The division on the subject illustrated how closely the two main parties approximate in strength.[p.t.o.
South Africa.References are being made to an early- appeal to the electorate, though this is hardly likely&apos;to take place much before March.The South West Africa Mandate Bill has passed through Parliament and received the assent of the Governor-General. The system of law, administration and taxation in the mandated territory will be gradually assimilated to that of the Union.The close of the special session of Parliament produced another remarkable appeal by General Smuts to abolish racialism and to. co-operate in making South Africa a great industrial nation.The Gape Nationalists are evideutly concentrating upon the advocacy of the smaller matters that are likely to injure the British connection rather than upon the out and out advocacy of independence which the Transvaal and Free State Nationalists always keep wejl to the fore.India.The Martial Law Indemnity Bill has given rise to - a warm discussion in the Legislative Council.II. i/E.September 25th, PJ19.

BRITISH  EMPIRE   AND   AFRICA   REPORT.SELF-GOVERNING   DOMINIONS.CANADA.Industrial Conference: Capital and Labour.-The Dominion Industrial Con-ference began its session in Ottawa on September 15th with over 200 delegates representing Capital and Labour from all parts of Canada, making it one of the most notable gatherings on the continent. Senator Robertson, Minister of Labour, is President of the Conference. Sir Robert Borden, who was expected to welcome the delegates, was prevented by illness from doing so.The Conference met for the purpose of dealing with the recommendations of the Royal Commission on Industrial Relations, and concluded its sessions on September 20th, having failed to reach an agreement upon the questions of the eight hours&apos; working day and recognition of collective bargaining by the unions. The employers, who brought in a separate report, conceded the justice of the principle of the eight hours&apos; day, but demanded the appointment of a Royal Commission to report on the special, conditions appertaining in Canada before legislation was entered upon. The Labour representatives, on the other hand, urged that the eight-hour day should be legalised throughout the Dominion, but that farming, fishing, and lumbering should be exempted if it could be established that the application of the law to those industries was impracticable.The Conference agreed upon the necessity of a minimum wage for women and children, and requested the Commission to investigate the need for legislation providing a living wage for unskilled workers. In regard to industrial councils there was a long discussion, and the Conference recommended the appointment of a bureau, being a branch of the Department of Labour, to investigate, furnish information, and assist in the establishment of councils.Resolutions were passed asking for an investigation into the,subject of State pensions, unemployment insurance, and proportional representation.Trades and Labour Congress : One. Big Union : Ireland, &amp;c. Eight hundred delegates are attending the Trades and Labour Congress which opened at Hamilton, Ontario, on September 22nd. \Mr. -Moore, President of the Congress, who is a candidate for re-election, is opposed by the Socialists and the One Big Unionists, and strongly supported by the unions which are affiliated with the American Federation of Labour.At the opening of the Congress, Mr. Robertson, Minister of Labour, pleaded for moderation and order. He urged the Congress to endeavour to affiliate itself with other labour organisations. Referring to the work of the Labour Bureau, he said they had more vacancies than men available. Unfortunately, however, this was not true of the centres of population. He urged single men without dependants to move to less congested centres where employment was more plentiful. In order [to assist, this movement lower railway fares, he said, would be granted. Applications were being-handled by the Labour Bureau at the rate of 1,000 a day, and 190,000 men and women had been placed in. positions since the Bureau was established.Addressing the Congress later, Mr. Tom Moore, the President, declared that the Canadian public was resolutely opposed to autocracy and would not tolerate it from a section of labour more than from any other section of the community.&quot;Such a strike,&quot; he said, &apos;&quot; may succeed for a moment, but in a democratic country like ours nothing can last for long that is done by force and against the mass of opinion in the country. Those who nse such methods are merely laying up for themselves a great deal of trouble, coupled with complete loss of public sympathy with anything they may subsequently do.&quot;The Congress adopted a resolution in favour of the same measure of local autonomy for Ireland as is enjoyed by Canada and the other Dominions. As introduced, the resolution provided that a copy should be sent to Mr. De Valera. There was much opposition from the Toronto and other delegates, but, as amended, the resolution was carried by a decisive majority.
The Congress has approved the action of&quot; the United States steel workers in support of the principle of collective bargaining, and a telegram was sent to tbe Executives of the Steel Workers to that effect.War Expenditure. The war expenditure of the Dominion still amounts to $500,000 per day.Soldiers sent Overseas. The report of the Minister of Overseas Military Forces states that the total number of Canadian soldiers sent overseas was 490,913. Of this number, 364,599 were alive at the end of the war.Indemnity from Germany. The Dominion Government have refused to give an estimate of the indemnity expected from Germany.Manufactures for Greece, An order has been secured from Greece by the Canadian Trade Mission for $25,000,000 worth of manufactured articles.Prince Edward Island. Mr. Murdoch McKinnon has been appointed Lieutenaiit-Governor of Prince Edward Island. The Premier of the Island (Mr. Aubiu E. Arsenault) has resigned and Mr. John H. Bell, the Liberal Leader, has formed a new Administration.Ontario Elections.-The Ontario Legislature has been dissolved, and the General Election is fixed for October 20th. On the same day the people will vote under the Liquor Referendum.At the time of its dissolution the Legislature contained. 76 Conservatives, 30 Liberals, and two United Farmers, with three seats vacant. For the new election 44 Conservatives, 47 Liberal, and 57 Farmer candidates have been nominated. Twenty seats will also be contested by Labour candidates.AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH.Form of Mandate. The Prime Minister of the Commonwealth (Mr. Hughes) has telegraphed to the British Government strongly urging that para. 6 of the earlier draft dealing with the ultimate incorporation of mandated territory in certain events should be reinserted, particularly the. proviso that safeguards as to military bases, fortifications, &amp;c, should continue in the event of incorporation. This is considered of special importance as a&apos; similar proviso would then apply to islands north of the Equator which might otherwise be fortified in the future. The Commonwealth Prime Minister also strongly objects to the wording of the draft of organ four, which, he says, gives an absolute right of entry to any person who calls himself a missionary. He suggests the substitution of words to the following effect : undertakes to allow all reasonable facilities to accredited missions as regards access of missionaries yho are the subjects of or citizens of auy member of the League of Nations.&quot;In reply, the Secretary of State for the Colonies (Lord Milner) states that as Chairman of the Mandates Commission he did his best to obtain a form of mandate most favourable to Australia, and he thinks it would be unwise to reopen the question now. Lord Milner points out that it was evident the Commission were not prepared to insert the provision for the incorporation of the islands in the Mandate and to continue to press for it would have been useless. The fact that no provision for incorporation is included in the Mandate will not in the least prohibit an appeal to the League of Nations to allow such incorporation, if there is a bond-fide demand on the part of natives in the future ; and the League would be pretty certain, if agreeing to it, to insist that the reservation as to fortifications be maintained.As to the point regarding the admission of missionaries, Lord Milner observes that the expression &quot;all reasonable facilities&quot; would make it possible to appeal to the League whenever it was considered that reasonable facilities had been withheld. Further, he does not agree that the absolute right of entry is given to persons who are not bond-fide missionaries or to whom legitimate objection could be taken. The rights conferred, he states, are conferred on missionaries as such, and, further, are &quot; subject to the provisions of any local law for the maintenance of public order and morals.&quot; It seems to him most undesirable that any narrow interpretation should be placed upon this proviso, the powers which Australia will possess under it being very wide.Parliament and Peace Treaty. In the course of the debate on the Peace Treaty in the House of Representatives on September 18th the Prime Minister (Mr. Hughes)
announced that the Imperial Government had intimated that the ratification of the Treaty was urgent, and the debate would therefore have to terminate by September 24th.On September 19th the House of Representatives approved the German Treatv and the Franco-British Treaty without a division. It was arranged that the Senate should meet on September 24th to consider the Treaties.During the debate in the House of Representatives the Minister for the Royal Australian Navy (Sir Joseph Cook) stated his belief that Australia was rid for ever of the German menace in the Pacific.Labour Party and Peace Treaty. -The Australian Labour Party have issued a statement asserting that Mr. Hughes is again trying to conscript Australia by -stampeding through Parliament a treaty which will compel Australia to deport its young manhood to foreign battlefields, probably in support of Asiatic interests against the white race.Irish Home Bute. The New South Wales Legislative Assembly on September 17th carried a motion by 29 votes to 28 in favour of the British Parliament granting self-determination to Ireland.The Premier of Queensland (Mr. Ryan) will preside over the Irish Convention at Melbourne on November 3rd.Meat Contracts:. Foreign Nations and Empire Products.  The Prime Minister (Mr. Hnghes) telegraphed to the British Government on September 18th that representatives of the State Governments of New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia and of the principal producers and exporters had authorised him to conduct negotiations with the British Government for a new meat contract from the expiry of the present contract to June 30th next, and to suggest that the Argentine contract with the British Government for meat supplies on civilian account should be adopted as a basis for prices for the new contract for Australia^ exportable surplus. It is pointed out that, with the exception of New Zealand, Australia was the only Dominion which, during the war, did not get the world&apos;s parity for her products. Now that the war is over it is contended that Australia is entitled to this parity. To pay higher c.i.f. prices for Argentine and American meat is, it is argued, to give foreign nations a preference over Empire products and so is the very negation of the policy of Imperial preference to which Great Britain and the Dominions are alike committed. The matter, it is added, is both urgent and important, as the Common-wealth cold stores are full to overflowing, and now that the season is coming on the exchequer is empty and the products must be sold. Great Britain wants these products and the Prime Minister says that Australia asks her to buy them from her own kinsmen at a fair price.Australian Spelter: Imperial Aid. The Prime Minister (Mr. Hughes) has announced in the House of Representatives that the Imperial Government has promised to advance 500,000Z. for the purpose of fostering the treatment of spelter in Australia.NEW ZEALAND.Budget: Samoan Administration: Taxation : Settlement of Discharged Soldiers, ccc The Minister of Finance (Lieut.-Col. Sir James Allen), in introducing the Budget on September 23rd, said the revenue for the year ended March 31st, 1919, amounted to 22,352,372Z., and the expenditure to 18,673,599Z., showing increases of 2,146,150Z. and 3,553,311Z. respectively as compared with the figures for the previous year.Besides raising the Education Estimates by 200,0001. in order to increase the salaries and allowances of teachers, the Government ask for authority to borrow 500,000Z. forthwith for land and building, for educational purposes, and 3,000,OOOZ. during the next four years. Samoan administration is to cost to the end of July 513,300Z. NTaxation wfll not be reduced for the present. The estimated revenue for the current year is 22,919,165Z., and the estimated expenditure 22,441,057Z. The loan moneys required during the year begun September 1st amount to 30,325,000Z., of which ad but 1,000,000Z. is required for soldiers. A sum of 12,500,000L for the settlement of discharged soldiers is to be provided from the accumulated surplus, which exceeds 15,000,000Z. Other credits proposed are 600,000Z. for the Govern-ment&apos;s hydro-electric scheme, and 100,00QZ. for a war memorial.
Gratuities to Soldiers : Party Division. The House of Representatives had an all-night sitting on September 25th for the purpose of discussing the Governments proposal of a gratuity to soldiers of Is. 6d. daily. The Leader of the Opposition (Sir Joseph Ward) proposed that the amount should be 2s., and moved to refer the matter back to the Government. The motion was rejected by 37 votes to 30. The majority included two Liberals, though five were absent. The Labour amendment for a gratuity of 4s. was rejected by 37 votes to 5 after the Liberals had retired.Women and Parliament. By the Governments Parliamentary Rights Bill the disqualification of women from appointment to the Legislative Council or from election to the House of- Representatives is abolished.Prime Minister and Shipping of Meat. According to reports cabled to the Press, the Prime Minister (Mr. Massey) in addressing the Conference of the Farmers&apos; Union, said he expected that 28 vessels would leave New Zealand in September, October, and November, carrying 2,700,000 carcases, leaving 4,250,000 in store.SOUTH AFRICA.Mandate for South-West Africa. Bill and Debate in Parliament. The Governor-General has informed the British Government that he has assented to the South-West Africa Mandate Bill. He states that it is a short provisional measure expiring on 1st July 1920 unless extended by Resolution of both Houses. It gives the Governor-General in Council wide legislative and administrative powers, but protects native reserves. The Prime Minister (General Smuts) in the House of Assembly gave a pledge that if the Mandate in any material respect went beyond or deviated from Article 22 of the Treatj^, the Union Government would reserve acceptance till Parliament had been consulted.In the Union House of Assembly on September 15th, during the Committee stage of the Mandate Bill, the Minister of Justice (Mr. de Wet) stated that the system of administration and taxation in the South-West would be gradually assimilated with that of the Union.The Alinister of Mines (Mr. Malan) declared that the diamond output in the South-West would be compulsorily handed over to the Union Government for disposal. The Government would be guided in this matter by the Advisory Board, on which the diamond producers would be represented.The Minister of Lands (Colonel Mentz) moved an amendment, which was adopted, limiting the Governments powers of disposing of land and mining rights during the provisional regime till Parliament passed legislation on the subject.The Leader of the Opposition (Sir Thomas Smartt) raised the question - of the native reserves, to which Air. Malan replied that the pre-existing reserves had been maintained, and two others had been added under the present military regime. Mr. Merriman urged the Government to exercise caution. He said that he believed that native interests would be closely watched under the Mandate.The House of Assembly passed the third reading of the Mandate Bill for South-West Africa on September 16th, and the Senate passed the third reading on September 17th.Governor-General and South-West Africa. The Governor-General informed the British Government by telegram of September 18th that he proposed to visit the South-West Territory, starting on September 18th, returning to Pretoria about October 8th. He added that the Prime Minister of the Union and the Administrator of the Territory favoured his visit.End of Parliamentary Session : Appeal by Prime Minister. The special session of Parliament concluded on September 17th with another speech by the Prime Minister (General Smuts), who appealed for a new start in South Africa without racialism and in a spirit of co-operation among the white races to ensure the great industrial future of the Union. The Premier at the out-set hinted at the possibility of early elections by saying it was not yet certain whether they would meet again in this Parliament. He emphasised that his appeals for better feeling and a greater spirit of unity had not been without marked effect, both in the House and in the country. South Africa, he said, could only be saved by the wholehearted co-operation of the old and new population, and division would be fatal to the country.   The ImperialSSS4-la b
Government and the world had agreed to recognise the Union as a young sister nation among the States of the world, and by closing up the ranks as a great white community South Africa would become worthy ,of the great honour conferred upon her. &quot; Woe to the man or party who stands in the way,&quot; the Premier exclaimed.. Continuing, he said it was their solemn duty to-day to reconsider and revise the * whole political situation in South Africa. The Premier asked for recognition of three fundamental positions. &quot;Firstly,&quot; he said, &quot;we agree to abide &quot;by the British connection. The British League of Nations and the new world system give South Africa ample scope as a free nation. Secondly, let us have the frank, honest, and wholehearted co-operation of the white race. I will never again be a partv to dividing South Africa on racial lines. Our primary object is to develop the powerful sentiment of a distinct South African nationhood, to bind the whites together, and to ensure the stable progress of South Africa as a free nation. Thirdly, the great task ahead is no longer racial, but has become industrial. Let us honour and preserve our sacred national traditions. Let us also go beyond that and join in the workTs great work.&quot;The Premier concluded hy pointing out that the great task of union was not yet completed and earnestly appealed to all to recreate the great spirit of 1909 and make a new start towards a united and prosperous future.The Leader of the Opposition (Sir Thomas Smartt), on behalf of the Unionists, and the Labour Leader (Colonel CrCswell) endorsed the spirit of General Smuts&apos; appeal, but no Nationalist spoke. The session then concluded and the formal prorogation of Parliament took place the following day.Nationalist Policy. At a Nationalist meeting held at Cape Town on September 20th, General Hertzog, replying to General Smuts&apos; recent appeal in the House of Assembly for unity, declared that even if the Nationalists] abandoned their secession policy there remained the Imperialist policy of the Government which led to the formation of the Nationalist Party. Moreover, he said, the Nationalists unanimously desired eventual complete independence from Great Britain and could not co-operate with General Smuts if it meant the abandonment of this their dearest ideal.Dr. Malan, the leader of the Cape Nationalists, endorsed General Hertzog&apos;s statement, and asserted that Sir West Ridgeway, when asked by Mr. Lloyd George whether South Africa had the right to secede, did not deny it. Dr. Malan urged- the Nationalists to work, firstly, for the annulment of the Colonial Laws Validity Act; &apos; secondly, for the abolition of titles ; thirdly, for the removal of Great Britain&apos;s right to station troops in South Africa ; and fourthly, for securing that the appointment of Governors-General should only be made after consultation with the South African Cabinet.Commission on Low-Gradc Mines.-The interim report of the Government Commission on Low-Gracle Mines states that, whereas there were 11 Witwatersrand mines at the end of 1917 working at a loss or a profit of 2s. or less per ton, three of these mines have since closed down, and the number has increased to 21, representing, roughly, half of the Witwatersrand industry as regards employment and expenditure. Other factors rendering the position more serious are the greatly iucreased assess-ments under the new Miners&apos; Phthisis Act, and the fact that the mines are working an unduly large proportion of their better-grade ores.The Commission make three recommendations, which they urge should be carried out as soon as possible ; firstly, greater co-operation between the mine managements, and the employees should be secured by works committees and joint committees following the lines laid down by the British Ministry of Labour ; secondly, the re-arrangement of underground work in order to increase the effective working period of natives without lengthening the time spent underground; thirdly, the experi-mental temporary employment of 5,000 natives from north of 22D South Latitude.The Commission are satisfied that the present sources of native labour are inadequate, more especially in the event of industrial expansion.The report makes no recommendation in reference to the question of retaining or abolishing the colour bar in the higher grades of labour, being of opinion that the total of natives employed will not be affected, whatever course is followed.
Martial Law Indemnity Bill. The Martial Law Indemnity Bill was introduced in the Legislative Council on September 18th by Sir William Vincent. He urged the passage of such a measure in accordance with constitutional practice, and declared it to be an act of gross injustice to refuse protection to officials who acted in good faith and who had no option but to carry out orders, and whom the Government, in a resolution during the disturbances, had solemnly promised to countenance and support. He asked non-official Indian members with a stake in the country ho w long they would retain their lives and property if disorders were not suppressed. Sir-William announced that, in view of the apprehension of perfectly responsible loyal Indians regarding the martial law convictions, the Government&apos; had decided that the cases of persons sentenced by summary courts in the Punjab would be revised by two judges one European and one Indian.Mr. K. K. Chanda, the Indian member for Assam, moved as an amendment that Sir William Vincent&apos;s motion be deferred until the report of the Committee of Inquiry had been received.The amendment was supported by Pundit Maiaviya in a speech which lasted nearly four hours and which was not concluded when the Council adjourned. Pundit Maiaviya attacked Sir Michael 0&apos;Dwyer, alleging that his action in interfering with Mr. Gandhi was responsible for beginning the troubles. He also assailed the officers of the Punjab, asserting- that peaceful crowds were fired on before any violence was committed. He described the Amritsar firing as an atrocity, and denied that a state of rebellion existed or that the acts of a few individuals constituted a national danger. He asserted that there was unnecessary panic at Government House, Lahore, and maintained that it was altogether unnecessary that European women and children should have been kastiR despatched to the hills.In the adjourned debate speeches were delivered by Sir William Vincent, Sir George Lowndes (who said that members who argued that no rebellion occurred, came from distant parts of India, and that not a single representative of the Punjab would make such a statement), Mr. J. P. Thompson, Umar Hyat Khan and General Sir H. Hudson.   The amendment was not pressed to a division.Economic Conditions. -The Viceroy reported to the India Office on Sep-tember 19th that the condition of crops was generally satisfactory, except where damaged by excessive rain, as in the United Provinces, Central India and Rajputana ; or by insufficient moisture, as in Bombay, Madras and Hyderabad. Relief operations had ceased in Ahmedabad. The numbers relieved were as follows : Bengal: works, 11,355; gratuitous, 13,870. Bihar and Orissa: works, 6,069; gratuitous, 53,286. Feudatory States : works, 6,826 ; gratuitous, 33,323. United Provinces : works, 31 ; gratuitous, 3,420. Ajmer-Merwara not reported. Central India: works, 5,600; gratuitous, 6,200. Central Provinces : works, 19,585 ; gratuitous, 27,709. Bombay : works, 8,530 ; gratuitous, 36,712. Hyderabad : works, 35,000; gratuitous, 35,000 ; Madras : works, 55,036 ; gratuitous (incomplete), 94,519.INDIA.
