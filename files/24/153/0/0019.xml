SECRET.APPRECIATION OF THE ATTACHED REPORT No. 113BRITISH EMPIRE AND AFRICA.Canada.The statement of the Prime Minister will set at rest the rumour regarding his suggested appointment at Washington ; his observations regarding an indemnity from Germany should silence Parliamentary criticism in this connection.Mr. Fielding&apos;s comments as to the Liberal attitude towards Empire questions is in accordance with the Government view that Canada should be an autonomous nation of the British Commonwealth.The War Mission at Washington will apparently be continued.The figures relating to the Bolshevik movement should receive attention.Australian Commonwealth.The announcement regarding a revision of the tariff shows that the Common-wealth Government realise the necessity of trade development cn more self-reliantlines.The disturbance in Queensland appears to have been due to Russians. Other points of interest in this Report relate to the Shipping Ring, Common-wealth shipbuilding, &amp;c.South Africa.The Ministerial statement regarding enemy aliens in the Union is of interest. As expected, the Nationalists are vigorously opposing the Bill providing for the . repatriation of enemy subjects.The Johannesburg strike seems to afford distinct evidence of a Bolshevik movement, and this is rendered more serious on account of the large alien element on the Rand.The Parliamentary debate on the proposal to start a Government fleet of ships is oE interest.India.The Moderate attitude towards the proposed legislation dealing with revolutionary crime cannot be disregarded.The food scarcity in various districts is disquieting. [p.t.o.
Other Colonies, Protectorates, &amp;c.There is. a steady improvement in the situation both north and south of Cairo due to the march of mobile columns through-the disturbed areas. A satisfactory feature has been the offer of assistance from the Beduin to the east of the Nile. The heavy casualties suffered by the Beduin has had the immediate effect of clearing them out of the Fayoum. It is probable that, with the restoration of communications, the situation is now well in hand, and that with the exception of a few areas which it has not yet been possible to visit with troops, any recrudescence of insurrection is not to be apprehended, as long as sufficient troops are available.. &apos; II. d&apos;E.April 3rd, 1919. .. &quot;

BRITISH   EMPIRE   AND   AFRICA  REPORT.SELF-GOVERNING   DOMINIONS.CANADA.&apos; , - ,Sir R. Borden and Washington. The Acting Prime Minister (Sir Thomas White) announced in the House of Commons last week that he had received a cablegram from Sir Robert Borden announcing his intention to return to the Dominion as soon as his work at Paris permitted.The message read as follows : &quot; You are authorised to state publicly that I am not considering the position as British Ambassador at Washington and that it is my intention to return to Canada to resume my duties as Prime Minister as soon as my work with the Peace Conference permits.&quot;.This announcement was received with cheers from both sides of the House.Question of Indemnity. In the House of Commons last Week the Acting Premier (Sir Thomas White) referred to statements made in the London Press that Canada was not in favour of demanding indemnities from Germany, and said that he had taken the liberty to cable to Sir Robert borden on the subject.The Premier at once cabled the following reply :- &quot; The report alluded to is absolutely without foundation, and, indeed, it is absurd. You are authorised to give an absolute and explicit denial to any such statements. We are making every effort to secure from Germany the,fullest indemnity that she is able to pay.&quot;Liberals and the Empire.-With reference to the statement recently issued by Mr. John S. Ewart, regarding the attitude of the late Sir W. Laurier towards the status of Canada within the Empire, Mr. AY. S. Fielding has addressed a letter to the Ottawa Citizen. In the course of this letter Mr. Fielding says : &quot; I want Canada to have all the freedom possible in the management of Canadian affairs, all unity with the Mother Country that is possible without sacrifice of the freedom we now enjoy ; and I want Canada to be all the time part of the British Empire. That is my conception of the Canadian Liberal policy, and that was the conception of Sir Wilfred Laurier. I believe that it is the conception of Canada&apos;s status that will be approved by practically the whole of the Canadian people.&quot;Ministry of Public Health. The President of the Privy Council (Mr. N. W: Roweli) has presented a Bill in Parliament for the purpose of creating a Federal Department of Public Health, with a Minister, deputy and the necessary departmental officers. Among other features, the purpose of the Department will be to pay special attention to the preservation of child health and the medical care of immigrants. It is proposed to form a Dominion Council of Public Health, of which the Deputy Minister will be chairman and the members will be the chief health executive officials in the Provinces.Bankruptcy Bill. A Bankruptcy Bill has been introduced into Parliament by the Government. It was&apos; given a First Reading last week. Mr. Hugh Guthrie explained that Canada and China were the only countries in the world not in possession of a Bankruptcy Act. The Act provides for an expeditious and inexpensive liquidation of insolvent firms, &amp;c.British Gift of Tioo Submarines. In connection with the Admiralty offer of two submarines to the Canadian Naval Forces, the Despatch from the Secretary of State for the Colonies contained the following passage :  &quot; The Lords Commissioners trust that this gift will be accepted as some recognition of the great contribution made to the defence of the Empire by the Canadian Naval Forces in the course of the war.&quot;
A later Despatch stated that Sir Robert. Borden had accepted the Admiraltyoffer. &apos;.&quot; : . .....Credit for Siberian Trade -Credit of $1,000,000 was recently established by the Government for&apos;Canadian trade in Siberia, and one of the&apos;Trade Commissioners at Vladivostok was appointed to act with the Siberian Supply Company, who have served as the British official agents for the distribution and sale of goods.. War Mission at Washington. In connection with the recent visit to Ottawa of Sir Charles Gordon, acting Chairman of the Canadian War Mission at Washington, it was announced that the Mission is now operating with a small staff, owing to the removal of many war trade restrictions between Canada and the United States. It is the intention of the Government to continue the Mission for the present with a small organisation to look after Canadian interests in Washington. The President of the Privy Council announced in Parliament on ApriL 1st that the exact form of Canadian representation at Washington was now under consideration and a matter of consulta-tion between Canadian and British Ministers.Bolshevik Movement. -The Dominion Director of Public Safety (Mr. Cahan\ speaking last week at Toronto upon the Bolshevik movement in Canada, is reported to have stated that over 63,000 Russians were now resident in Canada, while out of 70,000 Austro-Hungariaus registered as enemy aliens, few were not affected by the movement. The leaders of the movement, he stated, were Irish and Canadian, and although in Montreal there were probably 15,000 to 20,000 adherents of Radical Socialistic associations, the French and Catholic populations of Quebec Province had never been inoculated with the virus.Fixed Wheat Price. The Prairie members are continuing their efforts to get the Government to fix the price of wheat for the 1919 crop. A motion to this effect was introduced into Parliament by Mr. E. T. Myers (Kindersley), who argued that a fixed price was in the interests of both the producer and the consumer.The Minister of Immigration and Colonisation (Mr. J. A. Calder) had previouslv announced that it was not the intention of the Government to fix the price.Daylight Saving. Although Parliament has refused to adopt the Daylight Saving-scheme this year, in deference to the rural communities, the matter is not settled. In addition to the railways changing to summer time last Sunday in accordance with the schedule of the United States roads, the Post Office authorities announce a plan for the collection of letters an hour earlier than the time mentioned on the boxes, owing to the necessity of conforming to the changed train times. Cities will make the change locally, so that indications point to a confused situation throughout the Dominion.The Winnipeg Grain Exchange announces its intention to open an hour earlier in agreement with the New York and Chicago markets.AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTII.Tariff Question. The Acting Prime Minister (Mr. Watt) has stated that in. accordance with the definite pronouncement made by the Prime Minister in the House of Representatives in February 1917, which was reaffirmed and amplified in Mr. Hughes&apos;s policy speech at Bendigo in March 1917, the Federal Government have recently given careful consideration to the tariff problem and intend as early as practicable next session to undertake a revision of the tariff with a view to the development of Australian production and industry. The following important considerations will be kept in view : (1) The necessity for the preservation of industries which have been brought into existence during the war ; (2) the encourage-ment of new industries which ai-e in contemplation ; (3) the extension and diversifica-tion of existing industries. &quot; The great world conflict,&quot; . Mr. Watt said, &quot; has taught many lessons, and amongst them is that Australia, in view of its geographical isolation and of the long ocean distance, must develop itself on more self-reliant lines. The Government therefore have in view, in the proposed tariff amendments, the promotion of those great key industries, the raw material of which is within the confines of the Commonwealth, and upon which so many other industrial enterprises, are based.
inieBolshevik Movement.-Delayed telegrams- to the Press, dated March 24th, announce that Bolsheviks in Brisbane, including a number of Russians, marched in procession through the streets and overpowered the, police. They finally entrenched themselves at the Russians&apos; headquarters armed with revolvers. Returned soldiers have asserted that they will expel the Russians from-the city.Oilfields in Papxia: The Minister for &quot;Home and Territories (Mr. P. M. Glytih) has announced that an arrangement has been completed whereby the Imperial &quot;Government and Commonwealth shall each contribute 5(),O0OZ. to expedite the development of &quot;the oilfields in Papua (vide Report No. 102).Attitiule towards Shipping Ring:--The- Victorian State Treasurer, Mr. McPhersoii as head of the firm Of W. W. McPherson Proprietary, Ltd., recently commented on the remarks of Mr. Tredweri, the Chairman of the&quot; Australian Merchants&apos; Association regarding the sympathetic attitude of the Association to Wards the Shipping Rino-. He had been in touch with leading merchants in Melbourne, Who Tesented the Inference that Mr. Tredwen represented the views of Australian merchants. The Australian Merchants&apos; Association in London is an association of commission houses who buy for Australian merchants, and who for many ye&apos;ars &quot;have found it advantageous to work with the London Shipping Ring. Mr. Tredwen&apos;s views are not to betaken as representing hierchants who buy goods in Australia. Australian merchants consider that the Shipping Ring has &quot;treated thehi with the reverse of friehdlihess and &quot;consideration, proof of. which the bill of lading issued by the Ring may be cited, which contains tl most unfair and unjust clauses.The Australian Minister for Shipping, Mr. A. Poynton, has stated that there is no place in the world likely to suffer more than Australia by the action of &quot;the Shipping Ring. The great bulk of its primary products must find a market overseas, and the Commonwealth Government would not allow themselves to be squeezed out. The suggestion, that merchants would not ship by the Commonwealth Line is completely answerecl by Mr. McPherson personally. Mr. Poynton believed that Australian merchants are much more patriotic than Mr. Tredwen seemed to indicate.Commonwealth Shipbiiilding. The S.S. Delungra, the first ship completed in Australia under the Commonwealth shipbuilding scheme, was successfully launched in the presence,&quot;of the State Governor and Lady Davidson, and members of the New South Wales State Ministry. The &quot;Deluhgra is a steel ship built on the Isherwood principle, arid is the largest Australian-built ship afloat.Bye-Election. At. the bye-election for Petersham, New South Wales, the Nationalist candidate (2,633 votes) has been elected. The Labour candidate polled &apos;2,377 votes.SOUTH AFRICA.Enemy Aliens. The Minister of Interior and Public Works (Sir T. Watt) moved the introduction of the Bill providing, in certain circumstances, for the repatriation of enemy subjects and the revocation of the naturalisation certificates of former enemy subjects (vide Report No. 112). The Nationalists vigorously opposed the introduction - of the Bill. . In the course of his statement Sir T. Watt said that on Armistice Day there were 2/358 Germans, or enemy subjects, interned, most of them at Pietermarilz-burg. Seventeen naturalised British subjects of enemy origin were also in internment camps, and there were 1,660 eriehiy subjects on parole in various parts of the country. Internment Was applied, for various reasons : some &quot;were enemy agents or spies, others tried to assist the- &quot;enemy; others endeavoured to stir up trouble in various ways. Referring to the section of the British population who had been strongly demanding the repatriation of all/enemy subjects, and also of all persons of enemy descent, Sir Thorilas Watt declared that this Would be a great injustice, and he referred more particularly to the fact that the sons of many German immigrants had fought in the field hgainst;Pfhssian militarism. The Minister claimed that the Government had endeavoured to.steer a middle Course between the extremists of either side.Johannesburg Strikes. It is reported that the strike at the Municipal Power Station, arising from the decision of the Town Council&quot; to dismiss 30 mechanics, has extended to all parts of the municipal service. The situation is stated in the Press to be complicated by unrest amongst the natives. The Ministers of Defence and Justice deft Cape Town on April 1st in connection with the Rand situation.
government Fleet of Ships. In the Union House of Assembly on March 18th4 P 0 Mr. Madeley (Labour) moved that the Government should consider the advisability or&quot;^ securing, its own fleet of ships. .   &apos; \ :The Minister of Railways and Harbours (Mr. Burton) said that the Government had been considering the advisability of such a step, but the result was not encouraging and the question was not one of practical politics: .. Criticising a reference by Mr. Madeley to Australia s example, Mr. Burton declared that if ever anyone profiteered, it was the Australian Government, which carried wheat to England at twice the freight of the ordinary British requisitioned steamship. He considered the Australian precedent was not a good argument. Australia was fortunate when she bought the ships, because immediately afterwards the price of vessels rose enormously. -Whatever might be thought of the Australian venture during war time, the problem of a com-mercial line of State-owned ships in peace time was entirely out of the question. The British Government had displayed more readiness for the nationalisation of services . than any Government, but it drew the line at shipping.The leader of the Labour Party (Colonel Creswell) wholeheartedly supported the motion, emphasising the successful character of the Australian State enterprises. He appealed for a similar policy in South Africa.Mr. Black well (Unionist) commented at length on the success of State projects in Australia, while Mr. Jagger (Unionist) pointed out that the Australian shipping-venture was made in war time, when shipping was at a premium, and contended that the profits came out of the pockets of the British taxpayer. .   *Mr. Charles Malan (Nationalist) introduced an amendment demanding that the Government should take immediate steps to secure its own fleet.The debate was adjourned.Budget Debate.- In the Union House of Assembly, the Budget Rebate was concluded on March 17th. Mr. Fichardks amendment referring the Estimates to a Select Committee, and that of Colonel Creswell urging a more just distribution of wealth were negatived. Inclosing the debate Mr. Burton announced that owing to the continued buoyancy of the Customs Revenue there would probably be a surplus for the year 1918-19 of 110,O00L instead of a deficit of 60.000Z.Amnesty for Rebels. In the House of Assembly on March 19th, a Bill for granting an amnesty to the rebels of 1914 passed its second reading.Indians in the Transvaal. The House of Assembly has adopted a motion to appoint a Select Committee to enquire into the grievances of the British Indians in the Transvaal including the amendment of the Minister of the Interior (Sir T. Watt) providing for an enquiry into the alleged evasion of the 1885 law (which prohibits Asiatics from holding property), through the Indians becoming property owners by forming themselves into limited liability concerns. The mover (Mr. Alexander) asserted that the Transvaal Municipalities discriminated against Indians in the issue of licences. Sir T. Watt said that- since the Smuts-Gandhi agreement, the law had been circumvented and land valued at i&apos;00,000Z. had been acquired by Indians under the cloak of companies.Soldiers in England. On the motion for the introduction of a Partial Appro-priation Bill in the Union House of Assembly on March 19th, Mr. Merriman drew the attention of the House to the position of South African soldiers in England, and urged an enquiry into the conditions of their treatment and the alleged hardships involved. He complained of the treatment of South African airmen who had enlisted under conditions.which were altered when they arrived in England by the new Air Ministry. Mr. Merriman further urged that everything possible should be clone to send back the South African soldiers as quickly as possible.Cost of Living. The report of the Cost of Living Commission on profiteering-has been published. Regarding the specific terms of reference the Commission finds that undue profits were made in certain necessary commodities like foodstuffs, boots, soft goods and hardware, while bakers, butchers, and grocers had made smaller profits than before the war. On the general question the Commission advocates the reform of the present system by the substitution of co-operation for the present uncontrolled competition. The Commission recommends investigation into the meat trade, the appointment of an expert adviser for the sugar industry, and also the reorganisation of the native trade on the -Witwatersrand by the establishment of a.7786-1* b   .
Government central buying agency with subsidiary stores. The Commission further recommends encouragement and financial assistance being given, under licence, to co-operative enterprises with a co-operative bank to finance and control the societies, and also the imposition of a heavier excess profits tax.INDIA.Legislation on Sedition Committee Report. The discussion in the Legislative &quot;&apos;Council on March 12th on the Bill to cope with revolutionary and anarchical crime showed that the hostility of the Indian members was unabated. Most of the time was spent on the delaying amendment by Mr. Surendranath Banerjee, and in the division every Indian member present voted against the Government. The debate was characterised by protestations against coercive legislation and pleas for delay. Mr. Emerson, the official member from Bengal, related his personal experience of revolutionary crimes, and declared that recruiting by seditionists among young men was still proceeding in that province. There remain 173 amendments still to be discussed.After a. further day&apos;s debate during which opposition still contimred the Bill dealing with anarchical and revolutionary crimes passed hy 35 votes to 20.Mr. Surendranath Banerjee and Mr. Dinshaw Wacha appealed to the Viceroy to withhold his assent until it was proved that the Bill was absolutely necessary. Several members again.threaten a passive resistance campaign.Sir William Vincent replied that the Government would be abrogating its functions if it allowed itself to be influenced by such considerations. He warned members that though Mr. Gandhi might exercise self-restraint, hot-headed young men would be led into violence if the movement spread.Mr. Sastri denounced the European Association&apos;s statement respecting the Bills, which he characterised as a reflection on the loyalty of the opponents of these measures.The Bill to introduce changes in the penal code and criminal procedure code, as modified by the Select Committee, is being referred to the local governments and other bodies for opinions.The Moderate Party have published a manifesto stating that the only course open to get rid of the.Revolutionary Crimes Bill is to secure disallowance of the measure by the Crown. They accordingly sent a telegram to the Secretary of State praying the Crown to disallow the legislation, on the grounds that it had been hurried through the Council against the unanimous opposition of the Indian members, that the country is absolutely peaceful, and that there exists no need for legislation, the present powers being ample for all unexpected emergencies. They also urge that the atmosphere created by the Bill is absolutely prejudicial to the successful working of reforms and to effective co-operation between the people and the Government.At a mass meeting held at Madras on March 17th Mrs. Sarojini Naidu spoke in favour of passive resistance, and said that to every nation in its onward progress there might come a time when it should defy the law.The passage of the Bill -for dealing with seditious conspiracies has led to various developments of the passive resistance movement in Bombay. On March 19th the market was closed as a protest against the passage of the Bill. Posters were displayed throughout the city, in English and the vernacular, urging the non-payment of taxes, and asking the people to resist the orders of a tyrannical Government.In the Legislative Council on March 21st, the Viceroy, in closing the session referred to the Bills and the undoubted existence of definitely revolutionary organisations in India. &quot; P/uring the final debate,&quot; he said, &quot;I was asked to with-hold my assent to the Bill; in other words I was asked in my position as Viceroy to withhold my assent to measures which in my capacity as Governor-General I had regarded as essential. I think hon. members will see what an impossible position they wanted me to take up.&quot;Famine. The following telegram has been received by the India Office from the Viceroy, dated March 21st :  &quot;Famine has also declared itself in Goomsur and the Ubayagiri Agency, Ganjam District, Madras Presidency, and in parts of Aurangabad, Bir and Medak Districts of
Haidarabad. Scarcity has been declared in parts of Mahbubnagar, Nalgonda, and Warangal Districts, Haidarabad.&quot; Distress is still reported to be acute in the Jumna Chambal tract of Etawab, and is increasing in Bundelkhand. It is also deepening in Panch Mahals and Broach and is likely to increase from April.&quot; The &quot;following are the numbers on works and in the receipt of gratuitous relief : 	Relief Works.

Gratuitous Relief.Bombay                 -                 -	50,718	2.408	54,767Rajputaua	554	30	93Bengal	- 4,160		Central India -	6,700		2.190Bibar and Orissa   - .             , -	-      -	1,091	8,119United Provinces	&apos;    ; --:-       Nl	15,121	17,917Madras		5,725	2,290&quot; Central Province figures have not been received. The decrease in the numbers on works in the United Provinces and Central India is due to the harvest. Provincial demands for rice-are heavy.&quot;OTHER COLONIES, PROTECTORATES, &amp;c.EGYPT.Development of the Situation. Delayed telegrams dated March 21st and 23rd from Khartum reported that black and Arab troops in the Sudan were unaffected by the disturbances in Egypt, but that the younger officers of the Egyptian Army were in a state of considerable excitement.A delayed telegram from Cairo dated 21st, received 28th, stated that rail and telegraphic communication with Cairo, Alexandria, and Port Said was re-established.A Beduin force which attacked Medinet Fayum suffered 700 casualties, of which 100 were killed. Europeans south of Cairo were brought in by boats, and aeroplanes were patrolling to Luxor.A telegram despatched on 24th and received on 30th reported an improving situation in the Delta, but an absence of reliable information as to the area between Assiout and Luxor,The situation at Assiout was reported satisfactory on 26th and all quiet at Assuan, repairs to the railway south of Cairo being in progress.On 2,5th mobile columns left Tanta Damanhur and Salhia for a round up of the Ivafr-el-Sheikk, Hosh Issa, Delingat, and Facus areas, the first of which still remained a centre of disturbance and was surrounded by troops while arrests were being made.On 27th a large number of refugees were evacuated from Fayum to Cairo. Assuan was quiet, as was the Western desert and the oilfields at Hurgada, which were under guard. Cairo was quiet, and in the Delta a return to the normal was apparent.Only slight damage to irrigation works in the Delta is reported.The Beduin to the East of the Nile are reported to have offered assistance in quelling disturbances.A telegram dated March 28th reports the arrival at Luxor of a force which had &apos; been despatched from the Sudan. 146 European civilians are safe at Assiout. The area north of Assiout as far as Mallawi was still rather disturbed.The active measures taken in the Fayum have now cleared that district of Beduin bands.Cairo is said to be quiet and very little disturbance now remains in the Delta.
SECRET.APPRECIATION OF THE ATTACHED REPORT No. 114.BRITISH  EMPIRE  AND AFRICA.Imperial Affairs.Attention is called to the proceedings of the British Empire Delegation. The decision to provide free passages for suitable ex-service settlers in the Dominions is of considerable Imperial importance.Canada.The announcement regarding industrial investigation and the possibility of joint control of certain industries by representatives of capital and labour, may have considerable influence upon the labour situation in the Dominion.The information given in connection with the Bill to establish a Department of Public Health is of interest.Newfoundland. The General Election may be expjected next month. .Australian Commonwealth.The -statement of the Acting Prime Minister as to the importance of Australia being the mandatory Power in the Western Pacific no doubt indicates the view of the vast majority in the Commonwealth.The references to the question of indemnities and fiscal freedom for the Common-wealth should be noted.The Government have declared their intention to use all power necessary to pfevent Bolshevik excesses.    Deportation is indicated as a possible measure.South Africa.The events relating to the strikes in Johannesburg are worthy of attention as sh owing the development of Bolshevik principles. The methods oh settling the difficulty do not seem to have met with universal approval.Other Colonies, Protectorates, &amp;c.The restoration of order in Egypt was to be anticipated as soon as communica-tions were sufficiently repaired to admit of the movement of troops.   Sixteen mobile
columns are. now operating in Upper and Lower Egypt. In Cairo a notable fact is the animosity displayed towards Armenians. This indicates that the C.U.P. have exercised an influence, as in ordinary circumstances Egyptians show no particular feeling against Armenians. The students, cadets, and members of El Azhar University continue to keep the general feeling of unrest alive.As order has been in a great measure restored, General Allenby has decided that the restrictions on travelling may be removed and Egyptians who so desire will thus be able to proceed to Europe. The four Nationalists who were originally deported to Malta are to be released.H. d&apos;E.April 10th, 1919.
