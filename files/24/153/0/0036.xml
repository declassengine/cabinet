SECRET. I 7 tAPPRECIATION OF THE ATTACHED REPORT No. 130.BRITISH  EMPIRE  AND AFRICA.Imperial Affairs.Attention is called to an interesting communication from General Smuts on the vital importance of maintaining a full service of Inter-Imperial information.Canada.The return of the Prime Minister to Ottawa will, no doubt, involve the speedy reconstruction of the Cabinet.The suggestion made in the United States to exclude the Dominion from distinctive representation in the League of Nations has been vigorously taken up by the Minister of Justice.One result of Tariff Preference for certain products has been that United States manufacturers are establishing their plants in the Dominion.The question of tariffs continues to form a leading subject of discussion amongst the farmers. The attitude to be adopted at the Liberal Convention next week will be watched with interest-There seems to be a strong tendency to favour Mr. W. S. Fielding as the choice for the Liberal leadership, but Mr. Martin no doubt will secure the support of many leading men in the Party.The Labour difficulties in the Dominion are now passing away.The sweeping Liberal victory in the Prince Edward Island Provincial elections is significant, more especially as the majority of returned soldiers must have voted for the Liberals.South Africa.The speech of General Botha at Cape Town is of considerable importance. It will be noted that the Prime Minister is. reported as having stated that South Africa for the first time has been recognised by all the nations of the world as an inde-pendent nation. Too much significance should not be attached to this phrase, as apart from the fact that the cabled reports may have omitted references to the Imperial connection, it should be recalled that many years ago the late Mr. Joseph Chamberlain referred to the status of the Dominions as practically amounting to that of independent sister nations.India.The observations of &quot;the Maharajah of Bikaner on the representation of India at the Peace Conference and the recognition of India&apos;s important position in the Empire should be noted.Foreign Colonies, &amp;c, in Africa. The views of the President of Liberia as to the position of the United States in connection with the negro Republic should receive attention.H. d&apos;E.July 31st, 1919.

BRITISH  EMPIRE.&apos;..AND&quot; AFRICA  REPORT.IMPERIAL AFFAIRS.Inter-Imperial Affairs. Before leaving for South. Africa, General Smuts addressed a letter to the Secretary of State for the Colonies (Lord Milner) upon the great importance of maintaining a full service of Inter-Imperial information. In the course of this letter General Smuts observed : &quot; I believe this work is now being done by Renter, and. that it costs less than 20,&apos;OQOZ. per annum. Nothing could be &quot;more -important in keeping the scattered members of the Empire together than a full and efficient information service, and the 20,000L is probably doing more good than miUions of pounds spent in other directions. I therefore venture to hope that in a matter of vital Imperial policy like this, the narrower Treasury point of view will not be made to prevail.&quot;SELF-GOVERNING   DOMINIONS.CANADA.   ,Return of Prime Minister. The Prime Minister (Sir Robert Borden), who has been spending a vacation on the Lower St. Lawrence, returned to Ottawa on July 28th.Dominion Representation in League of Nations, The Minister of Justice (Mr. Doherty), discussing the proposal of Mr. Taft absolutely to exclude Canada from distinctive representation on the Council of the. League of Nations, since the British Empire as a whole will at all times be represented, has publicly stated : &quot; The right of Canada as a member of the League to be eligible for repre-sentation on the Council under the provisions of the Covenant was insisted upon by her representatives, and that those provisions conferred that right was clearly understood and unequivocally recognised by all concerned. A reservation in effect negativing that right Avould involve a change in the contract after its acceptance and signature by all parties in regard to a matter which from the Dominion&apos;s point of view is of its essence. As such it is clearly inadmissible and not distinguishable from a refusal to ratify.&quot;Tariff Preference omd United States Plants. Following the recent extension of tariff preference in Great Britain to certain products of the Dominions, there has been a marked disposition on the part of the United States automobile and tire companies to establish plants in Canada.Farmers and Protection. The Convention of the Western Farmers&apos; Political Party, at Calgary, has passed a resolution declaring a practical boycott of goods manufactured in Canada under a Protection tariff. Another resolution condemned the methods being applied to the trial of aliens at Winnipeg, demanded the resumption of trial by jury of all offenders, repeal of the amendment to the Immigration Act which gives immigration &quot;officers power to deport British subjects born outside Canada, and approved a 400Z. gratuity to individual soldiers.Mr. R. C. Henders, Member of Parliament for Macdonald, who has resigned his position as President of the Manitoba Grain Growers&apos; Association, has issued a public statement saying that the time has not arrived to plunge the country into political confusion in order to demonstrate to the rest of Canada that the West is concerned in nothing but immediate tariff reform. The directors of the Grain Growers&apos; Association, in accepting Mr. Henders&apos;s resignation, reaffirm their adherence to the principles of the farmers&apos; platform. Mr. Henders voted against other Western Members on the tariff section of the Budget.
Liberal Convention. The Ottawa Citizen reports that there is a strong movement in favour of Mr. W. S. Fielding for the leadership of the Liberal Party.The Liberal Provincial Premiers are beginning to arrive at Ottawa for the Oon-vention, which officially opens on Monday, although the preliminary meetings will be held on Friday and Saturday.   It is estimated that 1,400 delegates will be present.New Dominion Loan. Preliminary arrangements are now being made for launching a new Dominion Loan next autumn.Prosecution of Strike Leaders. Eight of the leaders of the recent Winnipeg strike (R. B. Russell, William Ivens, W. A. Pritchard, R. J. Johns, Alderman John Queen, Alderman A. Heaps, George Armstrong, and R. Bray) have appeared before the Magistrate at the Law Courts charged with conspiracy.and sedition. Informa-tions have also been laid against several other leaders who were prominent in the recent disturbances.According to local opinion the Government intend to press for convictions that will allow, under the amended Immigration Act the deportation of the strike leaders, whether British subjects or not.Labour  Difficulties. The  labour  difficulties throughout  the  Dominion  are rapidly passing away.   Sir Robert Borden has made a general appeal to the Labour -men of Canada to co-operate with other industrial elements so that the business life of the country may be speeded up and the work of recovery from the effects of the war hastened.Soldiers and LancL-Up to July 12th the applications from returned soldiers for farms numbered 23,147, and of these 17,271 were approved. Over $20,000,000 have been advanced to date.Seventy-two thousand acres of land in the Indian Reserves have been made available for soldier settlement.Liberal Victory in P.E.I. The Liberals have swept the Province of Prince Edward Island in the Provincial Elections, getting 2(3 seats out of 30, the only Conservative survivors being the former Premier, Mr. A. E. Arsenault, Mr. James McNeill, former Minister of Public Works, Mr. Murdock MacKenzie, and Mr. J. D. Stewart. When the House dissolved the parties stood as follows : Conservatives 18, Liberals 11, with one seat vacant. The present election was one of the most one-sided elections since Confederation, and the result was unexpected by both sides. Although in the Federal Election of 1917 several Liberals got a majority of the home votes, they were defeated by the returns from soldiers overseas. It is stated that the majority of returned soldiers voted Liberal on this occasion.Visit of United States Editors. The Department of Immigration and Colonisation has extended an invitation to some 300 newspaper men from the United States to tour Western Canada this summer. The party will be in Canada about 25 days ; it is being arranged in connection with the National Editorial Association.Visit of de Valera. It is not believed at Ottawa that de Valera, the Sinn Fein leader, will make an attempt to cross the Canadian border, as he could be turned back or arrested and handed over to the British authorities.In any event, it is stated, he will not be allowed to carry on his propaganda in the Dominion.A recent meeting of Irishmen in Montreal was divided over the advisability of inviting Mr. de Valera to visit Canada. Some fear was expressed that if he spoke in Montreal he would expose himself to the danger of arrest. It was&quot; finally resolved that an invitation be sent to the International Committee at New York, and to leave in its hands the decision whether de Valera should visit the Dominion.Trade Development Overseas. Nine Canadian Trade Commissioners from all parts of the globe have arrived in the capital for a conference with the Minister of Trade and Commerce.Post-war conditions are to be discussed, with a view to bringing about an extensive trade development overseas.SOUTH AFRICA.General Botha and Nationhood of South Africa. Great numbers of people assembled in the streets of Capetown on July 24th to welcome General Botha on hisS426-5aA 2
return from Europe. All tire -ships in the harbour were beflagged and the streets decorated. An imposing processiou was formed and marched from the docks to the City Hall. Hundreds of mounted burghers, together with mounted returned soldiers, and a banner of honour, worked by the/women of South Africa to commemorate General Botha&apos;s and General Smuts&apos; mission to Europe, were outstanding features of the procession.Replying to addresses General Botha warmly acknowledged the magnificent welcome given him.Referring to the Peace Treaty, the Premier said there were many points in it that he regarded as srrperfluous and impracticable. Everything now depended on the . Germans themselves. If the latter honourably tried to carry out the Treaty, he was certain the difficulties would be removed. The Allies were determined that peace should be established and maintained. He spoke most hopefully of the advantages of the League of Natidirs which it was the duty of every right-thinking man to support with all his influence.The Prime Minister proceeded to emphasise the fact that South Africa for the first time was recognised by all the nations of the world as an independent nation and placed on the- same footing as Belgium, Greece, and the other smaller nations. He regarded South Africa&apos;s recognition as a milestone in its history along with the establishment of the Hnion.The confidence reposed in South Africa by the League of Nations in giving her a mandate for German South-West Africa entailed a larger share of responsibility. He urged that South Africans should consider the problems which were bound to arise calmly and deliberately.General Botha paid a tribute to the moderate note which had been struck by British statesmen in the midst of the bitterness arising from conflicting claims at the Peace Conference. He stated that &quot; the important position South Africa holds to-day we owe to the way in which those statesmen brought the matter forward.&quot; British statesmen to-day, General Botha asserted, were leading the world, particularly Mr. Lloyd George, who had shown himself a man of the highest ability, tactful, but with a strong strain of the bulldog breed.-Referring to the South African situation, General Botha appealed to all to approach-the problems facing them in a spirit of determination, but with tolerance and calm. South African prospects had never been so rosy. Einally, in a tribute to general smuts, he declared that he had made a great name among.the nations, and no one had given such an impetus to the League of Nations.INDIA.Representation at the Pea,ce Conference, The Maharajah of Bikaner, interviewed on his arrival at Bombay on July 17th., stated that he was gratified by India&apos;s repre-sentation at the Peace Conference, as it placed India on the same footing as the Dominions and other countries.The recognition by the world of India&apos;s important position in the Empire, he said, was a matter of sincere satisfaction, and India&apos;s inclusion in the League of Nations was a step the significance of which could not be over-estimated. The attitude of His Ma.jesty&apos;s Government was one of goodwill and sympathy, and the fine part played by India in the war had evoked warm feelings in the hearts of the populace of Great Britain. It now only remained for India to continue to play her part in the future equally weU and to act with moderation and restraint.
FOREIGN COLONIES, &amp;c. IN AFRICA.Position of Liberia. Having concluded his mission to Europe, President King of Liberia gave an interview to ReutePs representative before leaving for Monrovia. He stated : &quot; Liberia.was Germany&apos;s last hold on West Africa. For strategic reasons she was driving a wedge there between the British and French Colonies, and her trade was 90 per cent, of the total. Germany has now disappeared from the field, and the British have a great opportunity if they will only seize it, for the field is open. Germany&apos;s strategical possibilities are a thing of the past, but the commercial situation needs closely watching. Liberia has suffered much from German action, and the questions arising from this are now before the Paris Reparation Commission.&quot; A most important matter is that of financial control. I feel strongly that the. present system of American, British, and French control does not work well. Proposals are now being considered by the British and French to withdraw from the receivership leaving the whole of the financial control of the Republic in the hands of the united States. I believe that England and France will raise no objection so long as British and French commercial interests are guaranteed. The United States has just concluded a loan of five million dollars for the payment of outstanding claims on Liberia. .&quot; The Government is determined to take a strong line with regard to existing concessions. We refuse to be made the sport of mere speculators, and are determined to insist on a policy of sound and honest development. . Where concessionaires are neither able nor willing to carry out their obligations, the concessions will be cancelled.&quot;
