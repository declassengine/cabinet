BRITISH  EMPIRE   AND   AFRICA  REPORT.SELF-GOVERNING   DOMINIONS.CANADA.Parliament and Peace Treaty. The Prime Minister (Sir R. Borden) has announced an Autumn Session of Parliament to ratify the Peace Treaty. It is intended that the Session shall begin early in October and shall last about six weeks.Legislative Programme. In the House of Commons last week the Prime Minister (Sir Robert Borden) announced the Governments programme for the remainder of the present session. The legislation to be introduced includes a Bill to amend the Dominion Lands. Act, another which will slightly amend the Criminal-Code, and a further Biil to enable Indians who served with the Expeditionary Force and who are desirous of taking up land to be provided with such lands on Indian Reserves. The Premier said that the Cost-of-Living Committee which was now sitting might make certain recommendations, and when these were made it would be necessary for the Government, to consider them,, and possibly to bring down a measure for the consideration of the House. He said that the forthcoming Labour legislation was purely conjectural, as the report of the Industrial Relations Commission had not been received, but when it was tabled this report might create a need for immediate legislation (see below).Future of Unionist Party.-The Government caucus have almost unanimously endorsed the proposal for the continuation of the Unionist Government, and there is little doubt that the next election will again be fought on the basis of Unionist versus Liberals.The Prime Minister (Sir Robert Borden), while expressing a desire noPto continue in office, strongly advised the continuation of the Unionist Party.Mr. F. B. Stacey proposed the motion to continue the Unionist Party, and when a standing vote was taken, very few present remained seated.Of the Westerners who stood against the Budget, nearly all were present at the caucus. The most notable absentees were Dr. Michael Clark and Mr. T. A. Crerar, who appear to have definitely broken with the Government.Industrial Situation. - The general sympathetic strike at Winnipeg ended last week.   The Strike Committee issued the following announcement : &quot; The general sympathetic strike is called off on Thursday, June 26th, at 11 o&apos;clock in the morning on condition that the Provincial Government appoint a Commission to make a thorough investigation regarding the reinstatement of all workers.&quot;In addition to the question of reinstatement, which presents one of the most-difficult problems, the. Commission.will also, investigate the causes of the sympathetic strike. The situation created by the latest move is that all workers&apos; return to their posts except the metal trade workers, whose dispute with their employers led to the original dispute and to the subsequent sympathetic strike.The Provincial Government wiU commence an immediate enquiry into the cause of the origin and conduct of the strike by means of a Commission consisting of one man Mr. H. A. Robson, ICC. The inquiry, beginning on July 2nd, will be as full as provincial jurisdiction will allow, and the prosecution of the arrested strike leaders will not be affected in any way.The Edmonton strike has terminated, and in Calgary the workers have returned to their posts with the exception of the postal employees, who have forfeited their positions by order of the Federal Government. In Victoria the&apos; metal trade workers have curtailed the strike and returned to work.Industrial Relations. The Report of the House of Commons Commission on Industrial Relations was issued on July 2nd.The Commissioners recommend an eight-hour day, with a weekly rest of not less than 24 hours, a minimum wage, Government action to relieve unemployment, the establishment of a bureau for promoting industrial councils, an immediate enquiry into proportional representation, and State insurance against unemployment, sickness invalidity and old age.
Other recommendations include the recognition of collective bargaining and the right of the workers to organise, the recognition of unions, the extension of educational opportunities to poor workers&apos;&quot; children, and, further, that the recommendations of the Commission be carried into effect in Government works.Permanent Militia Force. The Government Bill to increase the permanent Militia Force to 10,000 Was given a Second Beading in the House of Commons last week and was then discussed in Committee. On the &quot;Third Reading, which was carried, Mr. Robb (one of the Liberal Opposition Whips) proposed an amendment with a view to keeping the Permanent Force at the present strength, but this was defeated.Temporary Air Board. -A temporary Air Board has been formed as an Inter-Departmental Committee, and will- draw up rules governing flying activities of every nature in Canada.The members include Messrs. J. A. Sifton and S. C. Mewburn, Colonel Biggar, Dr. Coulter (Deputy Postmaster-General), Mr. J. A. Wilson (Deputy Minister of Naval Affairs), ancl Mr. E. F. Busby (Chief Inspector of Customs and Inland Revenue).Prohibition Bill: Senate and Commons. -Last week the House of Commons again considered the Prohibition Bill, which Was brought in some weeks ago, connrming the Order in Council prohibiting the import, manufacture, and inter-provincial trade for a year following the proclamation of peace.The Bill passed three readings in the Commons, but the Senate so amended it as to kill the 12 months&apos; clause, so that national prohibition would end on the proclamation of peace. On the return of the Bill to the Commons, the Premier presented a motion in which it was stated that the Senate amendment destroyed the principles ancl purposes of the Bill, and that in view of the difficulties facing the country during the readjustment period, and having regard to the dangers of unemployment and unrest throughout the Dominion, the House urges that the Senate amendment be not permitted to live, and that the Bill go through in its original form.The House decided against the Senate amendment by a vote of 105 to 34.Naturalisation Bill. During the discussion of the Naturalisation Bill in Committee of the House of Commons, Mr. W. D. Euler (&apos;()., North Waterloo) said the power given to the Secretary of State might possibly be used unfairly, ancl cited cases in his constituency, mentioning 95 men of Waterloo who in 1917 applied for naturalisation, and the Judge of the county approved, but the Secretary of State refused the papers. These men, he said, had lived in Canada from 25 to 50 years, and understood themselves that they were British subjects, but they were unable to prove their naturalisation. Some of them had sons fighting in France, and Mr. Eider asked what was the position in regard to these cases.The Solicitor-General (Mr. Hugh Guthrie) replied that if these men were Germans ancl unnaturalised prior to the war they must wait for 10 years, unless they could prove war service with one of the Allied armies.&apos;When the matter was further questioned the Minister indicated that he was unable to recede from, the British attitude.In the consideration of further clauses a discussion arose over the question of German citizens. Certain members pointed out that, whereas a German might come to Canada and be desirous of becoming a Canadian subject, ancl was opposed to everything German, just because he was considered a German citizen under the laws of the country, he was, under the present Act, unable to secure naturalisation.Mr. G. W. Jacobs (O., St. George and Etienne Carrier) moved that the clause covering this be struck out, but the Solicitor-General stated that he was unable to accept the amendment.The Opposition members objected to the Bill on the grounds that it was an Imperial measure, but the Government maintained their attitude throughout. The discussion was still continuing when the House adjourned.Soldier Settlement. In a speech on the Soldier Settlement Bill in the Canadian House of Commons the Minister of the Interior (Mr. Arthur Meighen) stated on June 23rd that between f 14,000,000 and $15,000,000 had been advanced to returned soldiers for land, stock, buildings, and implements. Over 17,000 appli-cations had been received for loans up to June 7th, the largest number for any province being 4,1900 from Alberta, and the smallest 210 from Prince Edward Island. The average amount of the loans granted is S3.393.8426-la A 2
AUSTRALIAN COMMON WE ALTILReopening of Parliament: Government Policy. The Commonwealth Parliament: was re-opened on June 26th. The Acting Prime Minister (Mr. Watt), in his statement on the Governments policy, said that the Peace Treaty and the Covenant of the League of Nations would be presented to Parliament when Mr. Hughes arrived. At the request of the Imperial Government, executive authority had been conferred upon the Australian Ministers to sign the Treaty on behalf of the Commonwealth, but its-adoption was dependent upon the will of Parliament. The Government felt that the powerful and sustained efforts of the Prime Minister for the presentation of Australia^ interests, entitled him to the unqualified approbation of the people and Parliament.Mr. Watt proceeded to say that the demobilisation and return of the armies was proceeding swiftly and satisfactorily, and confirmed the action of the Government in placing the working in the hands of a responsible Minister in London. Notwith-standing the serious effects of the influenza epidemic and the seamen&apos;s strike, returned soldiers were being successfully employed. An expenditure of 1,023,939L, he said, had been incurred in direct assistance to returned men and their dependants. The total liability of the Commonwealth in respect of land settlement was estimated at between 30 and 40 millions. Further money was being spent by the States. The initial stages of the housing schemes for returned soldiers were complete, and operations had been started. The benefits of the scheme would be extended to munition and other war workers who undertook service abroad under contract. The conditions of employment of returned soldiers in the public service had been modified in the interests of the soldiers. The repatriation machineiy was running smoothly and the system had already achieved gratifying results.The Government, Mr. Watt continued, had sent a scheme providing for the administration, conversion and extinction of the Avar debts of the Empire to the-Governments of Great Britain and the Dominions for consideration.As to shipbuilding, Mr. Watt stated that, the policy would be continued. Two-steel vessels had been launched in Australia, 10 more were under construction, and contracts had been made for another 10. Contracts for the building of wooden ships-in Australia had been cancelled, and it was intended to sell the wooden ships now being built on the Pacific coast of America. The policy of the Government was to continue the Commonwealth line of steamers and to build larger and faster vessels for oversea trade, and so assure satisfactory shipping at reasonable rates to exporters of primary products.   Negotiations in that direction were progressing.The Australian Wheat Board had 2,000,000 tons of wheat on hand, and 8,700,000 tous were being held for the Imperial Government. The Wheat Board overdraft was 18,800,000Z.Vigorous efforts were being made by the Prime Minister, Mr. Watt announced,, to sell the Australian output of base metals, but so far he had been unsuccessful. Negotiations were still proceeding to relieve the position of tlie Australian mines, and the Government were making advances to producing companies on the copper produced to March 31st, 1919. Proposals to relieve stagnation in the mines were being made by the Commonwealth to the States Governments.Forthcoming Legislation. In the speech of the Acting Prime Minister referred to in the preceding paragraph some indication was given of forthcoming legislation. Amongst the Bills foreshadowed was that dealing with the tariff (which will aim at preserving manufactures started during the war, encouraging basic industries upon which the national safety depends, and developing Australian production); improve-ment of the Industrial Arbitration Act ; legislation respecting naturalisation to better safeguard national interests ; the closer inspection and control of immigrants ; and other domestic measures.Industrial Disputes. The shipping strike continues, unemployment is increasing daily in the States depending on seaboard coal. The seamen still refuse to recognise the Arbitration Court.In the House of Representatives the Acting Prime Minister said that despite elaborate legislation and machinery designed to prevent or settle industrial disputes, Australia was faced with grave industrial troubles. The seamen&apos;s strike caused much unemployment amongst dependent industries, but as the SeamenV Union had challenged authority and the laws of Parliament the Government could offer no concessions.National Party : Confidence in Ministers. The Federal Ministerial Party, at the meeting preliminary to the opening of Parliament, showed general goodwiR towards-
Ministers, and passed resolutions that having heard the official statement of the Acting Prime Minister, embracing the actions of the Prime Minister and the Minister for the Navy, as Australians representatives at the War Conference add during the peace negotiations in Great Britain and France, expresses its entire approval and appreciation of the splendid work they have done and of the fact that their great efforts were put forward in the interests of Australia, and &quot;we hereby express our continued confidence in Mr. Hughes as our leader, that, this Party desires to express its hearty approval of the admirable manner in which the Acting Prime Minister and his colleagues have administered affairs in Australia during the absence of the Prime Minister, and approves of his policy for the coming session.&quot;Labour Party and Extremists. The Australian Labour Party have issued a manifesto warning the workers against the enemies within the gates, who aimed at destroying the authority of the Labour movement. The manifesto congratulates the party on the fact that the organised conspiracy to destroy it was decisively defeated at the recent Conference.SOUTH AFRICA.Parliamentary -Session.-The Union Parliament concluded its labours for the Session on June 20th. The last business was to pass the Bill granting an amnesty to the 1914 deportees and the 1914 rebels.Treatment of Aliens. The Public Welfare Bill has passed through Parliament, the House of Assembly approving it without a divisiou. The Minister of Justice, Mr. De Wet, announced, prior to the approval of the House of Assembly, that he was prepared to withdraw the contentious clauses, including the registration of aliens.The Acting Premier (Mr. Malan), in the course of his statement in Parliament with reference to the Enemies&apos; Repatriation Bill (vide Report No. 125) said that the Government^ policy had been while the war lasted to repatriate enemy subjects who bad applied for repatriation without awaiting legislation. Most of the enemy subjects who had been reported as a danger to the State had been repatriated at their own repeated request. He considered it unlikely that the Commission on the proposed Bill would recommend the repatriation of the remainder, and the Governm ent - had therefore decided not to pnoceed with the Bill.War Pensions. In the Union House of Assembly the War Pensions Bill passed the Committee stage on June 17th. There was considerable debate on the clause laying clown that all awards should be paid out of Union funds and on the amendment of Mr. Van Niekerk (Nationalist) limiting such awards to amounts supplemental to Imperial pensions, the Minister of Finance (Sir T. Orr) and the Leader of the Opposition (Sir Thomas Smartt) strongly emphasised the Union&apos;s liability, the latter declaring that it would be a disgrace if the Union declined to pay its just debts. The Minister of Lands (Colonel Mentz), replying to Nationalist criticism, called attention to the burdens which defeat would have brought on South Africa.   The amendment was ultimately rejected by 53 votes to,11.South African Mint. A South African mint to coin the whole gold output is proposed in a &quot;Bill which came before the House of Assembly on June 18th. The gold refinery will be on the Rand, almost the only point at issue being whether the mint itself should be situated at Pretoria or Johannesburg. The Minister of Finance advocated Pretoria, because the garrison there could afford protection to -the mint, and because the central gold reserve should be situated in the Union capital. The Treasury would be responsible for the financial arrangements and Jdie issue of coin required by the banks.Mr. J agger in a speech affirmed that the establishment of a mint in South Africa would save the gold industry half a million annually, which at present was paid in. freight and insurance of gold shipments. The gold output of some 30,000,000/, would be minted in the Union, and the gold mining companies would pay coins into their banks. The surplus gold of South Africa would largely benefit the South African exporter and the exchange rate of 6s. 3d. to-day from South Africa to London would advance to 12s. 6c/., or 15-s. Every saving would also help the low-grade mines.The Acting Premier (Mr. Malan) emphasised the importance of the Bill as establishing a new industry and announced the composition of the Commission upon
D-old industry It would have an equal number of representatives of mine owners-and labour, besides other representatives: It would not be an ordinary Commission of enquiry but more an advisory board for the practical solution of pressing problems of low-grade mines and labour conditions. The Bill authorising the establishment of a South African Mint was read a third time in the Union House o Assembly on June 19th An amendment in favour of the Mint being established on the&quot; Witwatersrand instead of Pretoria was rejected by 46 votes to 20.INDIA.Famine. The Viceroy reported to the India Office on June 27th that famine had been declared in the Deoghar sub-division of Southal Parganas in Bihar and Orissa. The numbers on works were decreasing in the Bombay Presidency and in the Bunclelkhand Agency of Central India, but a break in rains was causing anxiety in some Bombay districts. The numbers relieved were as follows : Bengal, relief works, .7,874 ; test works, 2,602 ; gratuitous relief, 18,918. Bihar and Orissa : relief works, 7,388 ; test works, 1,693; gratuitous relief, 18,411. -Feudatory States, Orissa: test . works, 28,963 ; gratuitous relief, 25,000. United Provinces : test works, 18,807; gratuitous relief, 18,631. Eajputana : relief works, 1,410; test works, 5,287 ; gratuitous relief, 2,400. Ajmer-Merwara -: test works, 275 ; gratuitous-relief, 371. Central India: relief works, 14; gratuitous relief, 9,459. Central Provinces: relief works, 9,716; test works, 12,366; gratuitous relief, 48,902. Bombay: relief works, .27,019; dependants, 24,651 ; village works, 5,000; test works, 740; gratuitous relief, 95,686. Madras: relief works, 4,793; test works, 2,726 ;. gratuitous relief (incomplete figures), 67,613. Owing to the large arrivals-of Burma rice in the past six weeks, the food position in the Bombay Presidency had materially improved. The food position in Bihar and Orissa was serious, but it was hoped to provide sufficient sullies to avoid a crisis before the end of August, when the Bhadoi crop should be ready. early  rice crops at Bihar were reported to be doing well.
