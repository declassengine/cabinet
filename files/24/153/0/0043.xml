SECRET.APPRECIATION  Ok THE ATTACHED REPORT No. 137.BRITISH  EMPIRE  AND AFRICA.Canada.Both Houses of Parliament have now approved the Peace Treaty. The Opposition amendment indicated a fear of interference with Dominion autonomy.. Mr. Fielcling&apos;s belief that the recognition of the status of the Dominions at the Peace Conference means the beginning of the break-up of the British Empire, is probably not shared by many representative men in Canada. Mr. Doherty&apos;s defence of the Government contained some striking references to the position which Canada has attained as a nation.The telegram regarding an Imperial News Service indicates a desire to maintain the selection of news in Canadian hands.The Canadian Government Mercantile Marine is of growing importance.Australian Commonwealth.Mr. Hughes has again emphasised the necessity of a Monroe.Doctrine for the Pacific. His references to White Australia will receive the practically unanimous approval of the people of the Commonwealth. The observations concerning the indemnity will probably cause disappointment.Mr. Hughes has announced the conditions for the mandate in the Pacific Islands.Questions ore again being asked as to the representation of the Opposition at the next Imperial Conference.The One Big Union movement continues to excite strong opposition.New Zealand.The reported references of the Prime Minister to the New Hebrides Condominium should receive attention.South Africa.Both Houses of Parliament have approved the Peace Treaty. The debate in the House of Assembly has been rendered noteworthy by reason of the striking utterances of the Prime Minister. The relation of the Union Parliament to the British Parlia-ment was dealt with in a manner calculated to meet the Nationalist standpoint; while the references to the position of the Dominions as members of the League of Nations contain the important statement that the British Empire is no longer a unit but a group where the Dominions have exactly the same rights and voice as England. [p.t.o.
General Hertzog has naturally been quite ready to plead the cause of the German residents of South-West Africa. The Prime Minister has announced that Roman Dutch law will be introduced into the territory which the Union will administer.The Minute of the Union Ministers as to the reasons for postponing the despatch of Imperial troops for garrison duty in the Cape Peninsula is significant. It is not difficult to appreciate that the Nationalists would stir up a great deal of racial prejudice regarding the proposal, and would endeavour to make much political capital out of it at the forthcoming elections.India.The debate in the Legislative Council on the Punjab riots has shown a desire that a non-official Indian and a non-official European should be added to the Committee of Inquiry.H. d&apos;E.September 18th, 1919.

BRITISH   EMPIRE   AND   AFRICA  REPORT.SELF-GOVERNING   DOMINIONS.CANADA.Ratification of Peace Treaty.-Both. Houses of Parliament having passed, the Resolution approving the Peace Treaty (vide next paragraph and Report No. 136), the Governor-General has telegraphed to the British Government the following Order in council approved on 13th September, viz. :  &quot; At Government House Ottawa Saturday September 13th 1919 present Deputy Governor-General in Council Whereas at Versailles on June 28th 1919 Treaty between United States of America British Empire France Italy and Japan and Poland was concluded and signed on behalf of His Majesty for and in respect of Dominion of Canada by plenipotentiaries duly authorised for that purpose by His Majesty on advice and recommendation of Government of Dominion of Canada.&quot; And Whereas Senate and House of Commons of Dominion of Canada have by resolution approved of said Treaty.&quot; And Whereas it is expedient that said Treaty be ratified by His Majesty for and in respect of Dominion of Canada.&quot; Now therefore Deputy Governor-General in Council on recommendation of Secretary of State for External Affairs is pleased to order and doth hereby order that His Majesty the King be humbly moved to approve accept confirm and ratify said Treaty for and in respect of Dominion of Canada.&quot;Parliament and Peace Treaty. The Dominion House of Commons passed unanimously the Resolution approving the Peace Treaty in the early morning of September 12th.In the course of the debate in the House of Commons, Mr. W. S. Fielding (who was Finance Minister in Sir W. LaurieFs Liberal Government) moved the following amendment to the Resolution, viz. : &quot; That, in giving such approval, the House in no way assents to any impairment of the existing autonomous authority of the Dominion, but that the question what part, if any, Canada shall take in any war, actual or threatened, is one to be determined at all times, when occasion may require, by the people of Canada through their representatives in Parliament.&quot;Mr. W. S. Fielding, in moving his amendment, said that, in the main, it was a good treaty, and having regard to the vastness of the problems, he was surprised that the statesmen of the Conference had been able to reach an agreement. The League of Nations was open to criticism and reservation, but it was a noble effort to put an end to the horrors of war and give to a distressed world the blessings of peace. Air. Fielding strongly took the ground that there was no necessity for Canada to be represented at the Conference, because it.had no particular interests, and he described the proposed ratification of the peace by the Canadian Parliament as all humbug. Canada had only remote interests in common with the citizens of Fiji at the Peace Conference, and Canadian Ministers w-ere only wasting time in being present at Paris. He said they would have been much better employed looking after serious Canadian domestic problems.Colonel Peck, V.C., interrupting, asked if the sacrifices Canada had made on the field and the loss of 60,000 men did not entitle Canada to a say in the conditions of peace.Mr. Fielding^ replied that if there were any Canadian interests they had a right to be present, but it was only making one&apos;s self ridiculous to claim that there were. He regretted the demand for recognition on the part of Canada. He feared it was the beginning of the break-up of the British Empire. When no Canadian business or interest was affected, it was unwise to insist on representation.   He1 A similar Order in Council was passed regarding the Treaty of Peace with Germany and the Agreement for the military occupation of the Rhine territories.
1oridiculed the part played by Canadian Ministers at Paris, and said they did futile work on committees in which Canada had not the slightest interest. He feared that the recognition of Canada as a member of the League would cause trouble in the future, and already the United States was objecting. As a matter of cold logic he believed that the American Senate was right when it objected to the British Empire having sis representatives to their one. The State of New York was as much entitled to representation as Canada. When all was said and clone, Canada was not a nation, but only a Dependency of the British Crown. As for the procedure of having the Canadian Parliament approye the treaty, it was merely humbug.The Minister of Justice (Mr. C. J. Doherty) spoke on behalf of the Government in reply to Mr. Fielding, ana expressed&apos; surprise at the Colonial attitude taken by Mr. Fielding as to the position of Canada. His attitude that Canada should not have been represented at the Peace Conference was one which belittled the country. Regarding the claim that Canada was not a nation, he said : &quot; Canada went into the struggle as a nation and played a nation&apos;s part. We did not run to cover as a Colony and ask the Mother Country to do our fighting. We sprang to the front as a nation among the world&apos;s nations. Canada took her place at the side of other nations and did her share in winning the victory. Nationhood is a matter of fact, not a question of what is written on the Statute Book.&quot;Mr. Dokerty announced that the Government could not accept the amendment. Dealing with the argument that Canadian Ministers should not have been at Paris, he said he was not lacking in respect for the statesmen of Great Britain, but if Canadian affairs dealing with the outside world were to be carried on along democratic principles, then Canada&apos;s participation must be through representatives who held authority from the people of Canada. Continuing, he said the Opposition^ fear of Canada signing away any Parliamentary control over their military forces through becoming a signatory of the League was groundless. The Council of the League could only exercise an advisory function and was unable to order any nation. The Council had no power to interfere between a GoArernment and its citizens, or to order a single soldier from Canadian shores without the consent of Parliament. He-pointed out that the Covenant could be amended later if the present plan proved unsatisfactory.The amendment of Mr. Fielding was defeated by a vote of 102 to 70, after which the Resolution approving the Treaty was carried without a division.Imperial News Service. With reference to the telegram from the British Govern-ment as to arrangements for an Imperial News Service (vide. Report No. 134). the Dominion Government have telegraphed to the British Government that they have given careful consideration to the proposal for the continuance of ReuteFs service, but they point out that the Canadian Press, Ltd., control the operations of the Canadian Associated Press, which has an office in London and supplies British news to Canadian papers. Both organisations are subsidised by the Domiuion Government. The Canadian Press, Ltd., intend to discuss an extension of their cable service at their annual meeting in October, but in the meantime decline to enter into any arrange-ments for the carrying or distribution of news unless they have entire responsibility for the selection of the news. As under the proposal the responsibility for the news would be left to Reuteks, the Canadian Government regard the proposed arrangement as impracticable at present.Mercantile Marine. The Canadian Government Mercantile Marine will have, before the close of navigation on the St. Lawrence, a fleet of 24 freight vessels on ocean routes, and the Canadian Pacific Ocean Services will have a fleet of 14 vessels on the North Atlantic &quot;alone.Wheat Crop in the West. Sir Frederick Williams Taylor, President of the Bank of Montreal, after touring in Western Canada, states that this veaks wheat croo in the West will be worth $350,000,000.Soldiers&apos; Re-establishment.-The President of the Privy Council (Mr. N. W. Roweli) announced in the House of Commons on September 12th that a special Committee of the House would be appointed to consider the cjuestion of the re-establishment of soldiers in civil life. Veterans have been carrying on a vigorous agitation for $2,000 (400Z.) additional gratuity. Mr. Powell read a statement explaining why the Government could not consider such a proposal, and why they-refuse a Commission to investigate its feasibility. They were willing to refer the Bill before the Commons, forming a Department of Re-establishment, to a special Committee&quot;
to consider all suggestions as to tire best methods of assisting soldiers. Mr. Rowell stated that Canada had already given its soldiers the most generous gratuity of any country. &apos;AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH.Parliament and Peace Treaty. The Prime Minister (Mr. Plughes) mov^ed in the-&apos; House of Representatives on September 10th that the House approve the Peace Treaty.   He recapitulated at length the doings at Versailles, and declared that the League of Nations was the foundation of the temple of civilisation.   The Monroe Doctrine, he remarked, on which America relied, forbade European interference in American affairs.   A parallel   case was the Pacific,  where America  should   not interfere,   Australia had. to face a new burden of debt amounting to 360,000,0001.  greater than Great Britaims pre-war debt.   While he and Sir Joseph Cook had fought for the principle of a White Australia, he told the Japanese he hoped they would remain friendly with  Great Britain and. Australia.    The amount of the Australian indemnity was uncertain, but at the utmost it would be 50,000,000/-., and Australia might get by 1921 from 3,000,0001. to 8,000,000Z.   After that the payments, would be spread over 30 years.   Mr. Hughes said he hoped  to see Australian rejuesentatives sent to the Labour Convention in Washington.The debate Avas adjourned.With regard to the amount of the indemnity to which Mr. Hughes alluded in his speech, a communication has been issued to the effect that Federal Ministers deny the report that Mr. Hughes had stated that Australia&apos;s share of the indemnity would amount to about 60,000,000Z.   They declare that the question has not been discussed..Mandate for the Pacific Islands. The Prime Minister (Mr. Hughes) announced in the House of Representatives that the conditions of the mandate for the Pacific Islands included the same right to make laws for the islands as on the mainland, subject to the following reservations : (I) Firearms must not be sold to the natives ; (2) a native army must not be raised except for defence of territory ;- (3) alcohol must not be sold to natives ; (4) fortifications must not be erected ; (5) there must be no slavery. Mr. Hughes emphasised the important victory gained at the Conference against the open door, thus preventing thousands of potential enemies from swooping down upon islands in close proximity to the mainland.Opposition and next Imperial Conference. rThe Minister for the Royal Australian Navy (Sir Joseph Cook), readying to a question whether the Opposition would be represented at the next delegation to the Imperial Conference, said that whoever went it would be a calamity if Australia were absent.Leadership of Opposition. -The Premier of Queensland (Mr. Ryan), having been, asked by xhe Queensland Labour Part.y to enterj?ecleral politics, replied that he was prepared to do so if he could thereby best help Labour.   (Vide also Report No. 136.)Trades Hall Council and One Big Union. At Melbourne the proposal for One Big Union has been thrown out by the Trades Hall Council.New South Wales and Whitley Councils. New South Wales boot manufacturers,. with the approval of the employees, have established Whitley Councils, but the Labour Council has decided to oppose the scheme as a most objectionable form of labour exploitation.NEW ZEALAND.Neib Hebrides Condominium. The Prime Minister (Mr. Massey), referring in. the New Zealand House of Representatives to the New Hebrides condominium, is reported to have said that New Zealand, should join with Australia in pressing the Imperial Government to try to secure a better arrangement with France.Coal Output. The Coalmine Owners&apos; Association has declined any further conference with the Miners&apos; Federation. While deploring the &quot;go slow&quot; policy, which has reduced the output by about one-third, the coal owners consider it best to keep the mines open.and increase the price of coal.The Posf says die feeling is growing that the requirements of economics and the miners&apos; demands are irreconcilable.
SOUTH AFRICA.Parliament and Peace Treaty : Text of Resolution.-The Union Government have informed the British Government that the following Resolution has been adopted bv both Houses of Parliament, viz. : &quot; Whereas a Treaty of Peace was concluded at Versailles on the 28th June 1919 between the Allied and Associated Powers and Germany and was duly signed by the Prime Minister and the Minister of Defence&apos; in their capacities as plenipotentiaries for the Union of South Africa ; and whereas it is expedient that the said Treaty (cojnes of which have been laid on the tables of both Houses of Parliament) should be ratified or ratification thereof exchanged on behalf of the Union of South Africa; the Parliament of the Union of South Africa resolves that a humble address be presented to His Majesty praying that His Majesty may be graciously pleased to ratify and exchange ratification of the Treat)7 on behalf of the Union of South Africa.&quot;Parliament and Peace Treaty : Debate. In the Union House of assembly, the Prime Minister (General Smuts) replied on September 9th to criticisms of the motion for the ratification of the Peace Treaty. He said that he did not ask the House to approve the Peace Treaty, but to ratify it. The Germans had been told that if there were parts of the Treaty which could not be carried out the)&quot; had the means in the League of Nations of obtaining modifications. He foresaw that at no distant day the enemy countries would become members of the League.Discussing the position of South Africa, the Premier declared that the Union&apos;. Parliament stood on exactly the same basis as the British House of Commons regarding the ratification of the Treat)7. The Union Parliament-was the legislative authority for the Union, and the British Parliament could not, without the Union&apos;s consent, pass any law binding upon South Africa. General Smuts quoted Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s reply to the Nationalist Delegation as the highest authority of the Empire emphasising the impossibility of agreeing to the disruption of the Union.Continuing his speech later, General Smuts dealt with the constitutional position of the Dominions within the Empire. He emphasised the fact that the great self-governing States in the last few years had received greater legislative powers, so much so that if the British Parliament were to-day to pass legislation concerning one of the Dominions it would be a revolutionary action. The Dominions in future, as far as foreign affairs were concerned, would deal through their own representatives and would stand on a basis of absolute equality. Until last year, he said, British Ministers had signed all documents and dealt with all matters affecting the Dominions. A change had come at Paris when the Dominion representatives had, on behalf of the King, for the first time signed that great document. The change was that in future the representatives of the Dominions would act for the Dominions. A precedent was now laid down for all time. In future Ministers of the Union would act for the Union. The change was a far-reaching one which would alter the whole basis of the British Empire.Regarding the League of Nations, it was incorrect to say that in the League the British Empire was a unit. The Empire was a group, but South Africa had exactly the same rights and voice as England. Though England was a permanent member of the Central Council, South Africa could be elected to that Council. On the League of Nations all the Dominions would be on an equal footing with Great Britain. Therefore, in the future, all parts of the Empire would be equaUy consulted in matters of war and peace. General Smuts was enthusiastically cheered when he declared that he thought General Hertzog and his friends would have rejoiced at this new status. He warned the Nationalists that, in America, millions of lives had been sacrificed on the altar of secession.Two courses, he said, were open mutual co-operation or the path to secession. The)-, continued the Prime Minister, wished to stand by Vereeniging, by their word of honour. On the other hand secession was the path leading to a broken South Africa, a discredited South Africa with a native population far outnumbering the white population. After declaring that &quot; only along the road of co-operation can we hope to continue the present course of progress, honour and prosperity,&quot; the Prime Minister compared the work of the two South African deputations in Europe. The results of the Government deputation, he said, would be recorded in the annals of history, for it had secured for South Africa equality with the other nations of the world!   The Nationalist deputation in favour of secession, on the other hand, evokedSSS4 3a B
from Mr. Lloyd George the reply that the movement brought nothing but misery and bitterness to South Africa.At a later stage tbe Premier challenged General Hertzog to say whether, as Mr. Beyers had said, the Nationalists no longer insisted on separate independence for the Transvaal and the Free State, or whether their policy now was for secession from the Union, as a whole.General Hertzog replied that the Nationalist Congress must decide.General Smuts emphasised the evasiveness of General Hertzog&apos;s reply, and gave it as a &quot; positive, absolute and decisive statement, that South Africa has not the right to secede from the Empire. Under Clause 19 jjof the Constitution, secession is impossible and unconstitutional.   The Assembly cannot secede from the King.&quot;At this point General Hertzog asked: &quot;Can it renounce the King ? &quot; General Smuts replied, &apos;&apos; No ! It is not a question of status, but of the Constitution. In the terms of the Constitution, the King cannot give up the Assembly,&quot; General Hertzog interjected: &apos;&apos; At the request of the people?&quot; General Smuts replied &quot; No. Of course by a revolution it can be done, but you cannot do so by constitutional means. As regards the veto, it exists, but where ordinary laws are concerned it is obsolete.&quot;General Hertzog interrupted, saying : &quot; There you are right, but wrong on the constitutional point.&quot; To which General Smuts replied : It is the duty of the King-to veto any lav,- under which the Union would secede from the Empire.&quot;, Protests came from General Hertzog and Mr. Beyers, whereupon the Premier referred them to Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s reply to the deputation.General Smuts declared that it was his aim and object to re-unite the Whites in the Union. He then proceeded to deal with General Hertzog&apos;s criticisms of the British connection, showing that the danger for South Africa was of standing alone in the world. Why, he asked, had the United States come together ? They had done so, he said, for their own protection. To-day not only had South Africa the protection of the greatest and the most powerful Empire in the world, but it had also a financial position and the advantages of a great and rich traffic. &quot;,Shall we,&quot; he asked, &quot;throw away these advantages, and get back to our Old ant-heap ? &quot;The announcement of the figures of the division (84 for ratification and 19 against) was greeted with loud and prolonged cheering. The minority were all Nationalists.The Union Senate adopted, by 30 votes to 5, a motion hq favour of ratifying the Peace Treaty similar to that passed by the House of Assembly.The Mandate for German South-West Africa, Debate in Parliament. The debate on the Bill conferring a Mandate upon South Africa to administer German South-West Africa under the League of Nations was opened on September 10th in the Union House of Assembly by General Smuts immediately after his speech on the ratification of the Peace Treaty with Germany. General Smuts&apos; declaration, which was largely explanatory of the application of the Mandate of South-West Africa, dealt with the two principles of the Mandate ; firstly, that there should be no military training of the natives, and secondly that equal opportunities should be given to members of the League of Nations for trading in the mandated areas. General Smuts also pointed out the safeguards introduced on behalf of the natives. He announced that the actual terms of the Mandate had not yet been actually approved by the Supreme Council, but that it would be necessary for the Government to have provisional interim powers pending an Act passed by Parliament.The Leader of the Opposition (Sir Thomas Smartt) eulogised the great services which General Botha and General Smuts had rendered to the Empire, saying that Ire desired to associate himself with the Prime Ministers appeal for the unity of the Whites.Sir Thomas denounced the attitude of the Nationalists, who, he said, were for ever trying to find fault with the Allies, but never uttered a word against the wranton destruction committed by the Germans in France and Belgium. South Africa was proud of what General Smuts had clone towards the formation of the League of Nations. The peace settlement, he said, meant the re-establishment of the small nations; consequently he utterly failed to see why the Nationalists objected to the Treaty. Sir Thomas Smartt, turning towards the Nationalists, then asked them whether they were prepared to refuse&quot; the Mandate, lie urged the Government to consider the Acts under which the Cape had acquired Kaffraria, Pondoland and Bechuanaland with a view to applying some of their provisions to South-West Africa. In giving General Smuts full powers till Parliament should meet again they were giving a large order, but they knew that General Smuts would act with impartial
7 o&amp;justice. The speaker concluded by emphasising the fairness, justness and excellence of the work of Sir E. 11.. L. Georges, tke administrator of the former Grman colony, and his magistrates.General Hertzog strongly protested against these proceedings when the House was quite unaware what exactly the Mandate was. He asked whether the Union was going to spend large sums of money in South-West Africa for love. He maintained that the Germans in German South-West Africa had been innocently dragged into the war, and he would not object to South Africa taking over the guardianship of the South-West provided it was understood that everything would be clone to meet the people there. The Nationalist Leader expressed his regret that the Germans in the South-West had not been consulted on the subject of the proposed Mandate.Mr. Merriman said he feared that the League of Nations would be the seed of many future disputes and wars if the settlement of questions were left to the small nations. He pointed out that India would enjoy an equality of status-with South Africa, and that if the Indians here had grievances they would take them to the League of Nations. The speaker particularly objected to tke trial of the ex-Kaiser and appealed to the Government to provide a Bill for the preservation of the native reserves.Mr. Jagger said it was estimated that the assets which would be acquired by the Union in the South-West were worth 12,000,000Z., including the railways, which were worth 9,000,000Z.The Prime Minister (General Smuts), in reply to the Nationalist arguments, declared that he thought that the German people of South-West Africa would prefer the Union administration to any other such as that of the British Imperial Govern-ment. He believed that in the interests of the Union and the native population the territory should be administered by the Union. He announced that Roman Dutch law would be introduced, that all public assets which had belonged to the German Government would be handed over to the Union, and all costs of administration charged against the Union.There had been deficits in the territory during the war, but it would not be necessary to keep up a large military establishment, while the revenue from diamonds would increase. He therefore anticipated a satisfactory surplus. The country would quickly develop under the Union and could accommodate a large population. There was no intention to interfere with the peaceful.German settlers, and.he trusted that they would become a great asset. It was to the interests of all that the country should be opened up for settlement.The Bill regarding the Mandate conferred upon South Africa to administer South-West Africa under the League of Nations passed the second reading in the House of Assembly by 70 votes to 23.Imperial Troops for Garrison Duty: Position of Union Government. With reference to the proposal to send Imperial troops to the Cape Peninsula immediately to take over garrison duty there, the Union Ministers have written a Minute commenting upon the War Office telegram to the General Officer Commanding the South African Military Command. The Ministers express their feeling that it would be inopportune under present circumstances to prejudge the issues involved by re-establishing the pro-war position of the Cape Peninsula Garrison, Regular Imperial Troops, until the Union Government and the British Government have exchanged views, and have arrived at definite conclusions on the problem as a whole. It is pointed out that the early return of even a portion of the Imperial Garrison would present certain practical difficulties and would create local embarrassment. The problem oi the employment of returned soldiers specially enlisted for garrison duty in the Union Defence Forces would be rendered more acute, and the very grave shortage of housing accommodation would be materially accentuated, while the pressure on the available shipping for returning soldiers and other South Africans would be increased. It is added that there are also highly important constitutional political aspects upon which Ministers at this juncture and during the special session of the Union Parliament do not feel in a position to state the attitude of the Union Government. Under these circumstances the Union Government request that any proposal to send Imperial troops to the Cape may be held in abeyance until consultation has taken place between Union Ministers and the British Government, and a course of action agreed upon covering the general scheme.sssi-3sc
INDIA.Punjab Riots. Debate in Legislative Council. A debate was initiated in the Legislative Council on September 10th by Pundit Malaviya, proposing a commission of persons not connected with the Government to investigate the Punjab disturbances, with power to annul sentences inflicted under martial law. -The Pundit asserted that the Indian public was disappointed with the consti-tution of the Committee announced by the Viceroy, and also with the terms of reference. He said he was grieved at the fate of the Europeans done to death by the fury of. the mob, and was also grieved for the hundreds of Indians who fell victims to the fury of those responsible for maintaining order.Sir Edward Maclagan, who followed, declared that people outside the Punjab did not realise the gravity of the disturbances. But for the rapidity with which the disturbances were met, the lives and property of all classes in the Central Punjab, and. possibly beyond that province, would have been in imminent danger. Regarding the martial law cases, he had examined many, and could not find one in which he could impugn the decisions of the Courts. The question of punishment, however, was different, as in many cases the Courts were compelled by law to inflict severe sentences. Sir Edward explained his policy regarding the reduction of the sentences, which was to prove that the Government was not vindictive, and to restore confidence between the authorities and the people.A vigorous speech was made by Mr. W. E. Crum, president of the Bengal Chamber of Commerce, on behalf of the European community, in which he said that they possessed the same rights of citizenship as the other communities in India. It was Europeans who were murdered, in the Punjab, European churches which were burned, European property which was destroyed. He appealed to the Viceroy to add a non-official European to the Committee of Inquiry, ancl maintained that the terms of reference should be altered, not in order to reduce or annul the sentences passed on persons guilty of murder, arson, ancl sacrilege, but to provide reparation for European victims and protection for the scattered European community against a. recurrence of the outrages.Major Urnar Plyatt Khan complained of the interference of outsiders in the Punjab.   He had been working in that province during the disturbances, ancl also serving on the Frontier during the recent war, and said that he would at a future date bring forward facts to prove the connection between these events. The debate was adjourned.Replying to a question, Sir William Vincent stated that the number of persons killed in the Punjab during the disturbances was : 14 at Lahore, 301 at Amritsar, 17 at Gujranwala, and two at Gujrat.In the adjourned debate on September 12th Mr. K. K. Chanda bitterly attacked the Punjab Administration, asserting that the charges against Sir Michael 0&apos;Dwyer (Lieutenant-Governor of the Punjab) were scarcely less grave than those against Warren Hastings. He described the proceedings under martial law as a travesty of justice, and quoted the statement of a released prisoner, whose sentence has been reduced, to show that the clemeiKry of Sir Edward Maclagan in reducing sentences had failed to strike a responsive chord among those remaining in gaol.Pundit Malaviya, in a second speech, heatedly declared that Indians were massacred at Amritsar, ancl that inquiry would probably show that those who had attacked the Europeans were not to blame as they had received provocation.Sir William Vincent strongly condemned these statements, pointing out that the European victims at Amritsar were inoffensive people who were not connected with, the Government. He said it was unreasonable, after the British Government had agreed to the appointment of a Committee, to demand a Royal Commission to report to the Secretary of State. The Committee appointed by the Government of India could only report to the Government of India.&apos; Besides, the Government had grave responsibilities, and, if it divested itself of these, it would show its incompetence to maintain order and protect its own officers.Sir Dinshaw Wacha urged that the result of the inquiry be awaited, and. expressed his confidence in British justice.The resolution was ultimately rejected without a division.
Washington Labour Congress. A Simla telegram states that the delegates from India to the Washington Labour Congress will be Mr. L. J. Kershaw, of the India Office ; Mr. A. Chatterjee, Indian Civil Service, Government, members ; Mr. A. Murray, Chairman of the Indian Jute Association, member for the employers ; and Mr. Narayan Joshi, of Bombay, member for the emploj-ed. The composition of the . delegation has, however, not yet finally been settled.Economic Conditions. The Viceroy telegraphed to the India Office on Sep-tember 12th that the prospects of crops were good or satisfaetoiy, but that the damage by excessive rain and floods was again reported in parts of Bihar and Orissa, the United Provinces, Central India, and Bombay. A much needed break occurred in the Central Provinces, and light rain had fallen in Deccan, where it was much needed. Relief works in the Poona District and. relief in Panch Mahals, Kaira, and Rewa Kantha Districts of Bombay Presidency had been closed. The numbers relieved were as follows : Bengal : relief works, 8,923 ; test works, 32 ; gratuitous relief, 14,721. Bihar and Orissa : relief works, 2,571 ; test works, 3,307 ; gratuitous relief, 5S,633. Feudatory States of Orissa : test works, 5,997 ; gratuitous relief, 29,517. United Provinces : test works, 166 ; gratuitous relief, 4,963. Ajmer-Merwara : gratuitous relief, 169. Central India: relief works, 5,500; gratuitous relief, 4,400. Central Provinces: relief works, 10,752; test works, 5,454; gratuitous relief, 28,676. Bombay : relief works, 11,641 ; dependants, 5,889 ; village works, 1,121 ; gratuitous relief, 37,167. Hyderabad report not received. Madras : relief works, 49,640 ; test works, 188;  gratuitous relief (incomplete figures), 93,608.The foodstuffs position was improving except in Bengal. The demands for Burma rice had practically ceased except in the south of the Peninsula and Bengak The prices in Bengal had risen rapidly, and large supplies of Burma rice were being-imported.   Elsewhere the prices showed a tendency to fall.
