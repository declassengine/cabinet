SECRET.APi-ltPiOTATJLON OF THE ATTACHED fuel ?OUT No. 132.BRITISH EMPIRE AND AFRICA.Canada.The acceptance of Sir R. Borden&apos;s suggestion that Sir Herbert Ames should be appointed Financial Director in the Secretariat of the League of Nations, will guarantee that the post will be filled by a highly capable and experienced man, who has performed admirable administrative work during the war.The election of Mr. Mackenzie King as Leader of the Liberal Party means that the Liberals will be led by one of the younger men of proved capacity, who will, moreover, be acceptable to Quebec. The election was not altogether expected, but was rendered possible by the withdrawal of Mr. i\lartin&apos;s candidature.; The virtual acceptance by the Liberal Convention of the tariff position of the Dominion Council of Agriculture will involve ail increase of support from the farmers and a strong opposition from industrial and financial interests.The Resolution of the Liberals upon Empire relations shows the usual caution regarding interference with autonomy.The view of the Dominion Government concerning ships owned in Canada but registered in the United Kingdom will probably be reflected in Parliament during the coming session unless some action is taken in the meantime.AustJialian Commonwealtii.Parliamentary approval of the Peace Treaty will presumably be obtained soon after Mr. Hughes&apos; arrival in Australia, as, unlike the other Dominions, the Common-wealth Parliament is now in session.There seems to be a better prospect of settlement of the seamems strike.New Zealand.The General Election may be expected to take place this year. The allocation of the naval subsidy to the upkeep of a cruiser will no doubt appeal to local sentiment.South Africa.The enquiry from the Union Ministers as to the form in which Parliamentary approval should be given to the Peace Treaty affects all the Dominions.The summoning of Parliament for September may have the effect of hastening the General Election.The preponderance of the British Empire in the councils of the world, and the influential position occupied by South Africa as a member of the British Common-wealth of Nations, has provided General Smuts with an effective answer&apos; to Nationalist propaganda.India.The crop prospects continue favourable.The report of the Calcutta University Commission is important.H. d&apos;E.August 14th, 1919,

BRITISH  EMPIRE   AND  AFRICA  REPORT.SELF-GOVERNING  DOMINIONS.CANADA.Financial Director of the League of Nations. In pursuance of the invitation to the Canadian Prime Minister to suggest a suitable person for the post of Financial Director in the Secretariat of the:League of Nations, Sir Robert Borden put forward the name of Sir Herbert Ames, Member of Parliament for the St. Antoine Division of Montreal. Sir Eric Drummond thereupon&quot; offered the position to Sir Herbert Ames, who has accepted it. It should be added that the appointment of all members of the Secretariat are provisional and subject to&apos; confirmation by the Council of the LeagueA       .. New Liberal Leader. Mr. Mackenzie King has been elected by the Ottawa Convention Leader of the Liberal Party at the third ballot. Four candidates were nominated.:-Mr. King, Mr. Fielding (ex-Minister of Finance), Mr. Graham (ex-Mihister of Railways), and Mr. MacKenzie (the temporary Leader). Mr. King led on the first ballot, with Mr. Fielding second. In the&apos; third ballot, Mr. Graham and Mr. Mackenzie retired, and Mr. King won by a vote of 476 to 438. It is stated that out of 297 Quebec delegates only 75 voted for Mr. Fielding, and the Toronto Mail and Empire describes Mr. King as Quebec!s choice.William Lyon Mackenzie King, who was born in 1874, is a grandson of William Lyon Mackenzie, the Reformer Leader in Upper Canada in the first half of last century, who was associated with the French-Canadian- patriot, Papineau, in the rising of 1837. The new Liberal Leader has devoted special attention to questions affecting, the relations between capital and labour, and to general social and economic problems, and He has many times acted as-Government Conciliator in big strikes. From 1914 to 1918 he was Director of the Industrial Relations Department of the Rookefeder Foundation. In 1900 he became Deputy Minister of Labour and editor of the Labour Gazette, and he held these posts until 1908.&apos; He sat as Liberal member for North Waterloo. Ontario, from 1908 to 1911, and he was Labour Minister in. the Laurier Administration from 1909 to 1911.It is not yet known where Mr. Mackenzie King will obtain a constituency. In Ontario, Glengarry and North Ontario are vacant, while Quebec East, for which Sir Wilfrid Laurier sat, has been unrepresented since his death. There are other vacancies elsewhere, but it is thought that Mr. King will desire to be elected in Ontario... Liberals and Imperial Relations. -At the Liberal Convention on August 6th one of the first resolutions moved by Senator Dandurand (Quebec), dealt with the question of Imperial relations, declaring that no organic change in the relations between the Dominion and the Empire should come into effect until ratified by a vote of the Canadian people.An amendment moved by Mr. W. D. Gregory (Toronto) suggested the insertion of words to the effect that, the Convention objected to: any attempt to centralise Imperial control, and this was carried.Mr. Lemieux, ex-Postmaster-General, supported the amended resolution, and said he wished to explain the attitude of French Canadians towards the Empire. French Canadians were proud of being British subjects. Although the conquered race, they had achieved responsible government. They had seen the time when Canada was governed from Downing Street, but now a free and responsible Government had been installed in the Dominion. They were all subjects of the same King, but Canada had its own Government, and must run its own country. He said there had been an insidious movement to destroy Canadian autonomy, but it had received a check when the last Parliament passed a resolution providing for the abolition of titles. The war-had proved that the Mother Country need attach no; strings to her Dominions. When it was a question of maintaining the highest principles of liberty and democracy, Canada could be relied upon to rally to the cause. A good motto to adopt would be to leave well enough alone in Imperial relations.
Liberals and the Tariff. At the Liberal Convention much discussion has taken place over the platform to be adopted by the Liberals on the question of the tariff. The resolution ultimately adopted pledged the Party to increase the British Preference to 50 per cent., and to put on the free list wheat, wheat flour, principal articles of food, farm implements and machinery, flour and saw mill machinery, farm tractors, mining machinery and repair parts, rough and dressed lumber, gasolene, illuminating, lubricating, and fuel oils, nets, net twines, and fishermen&apos;s equipments cements and fertilisers.The Party also pledged itself to substantial reductions of the tariff on wearing apparel and footwear and articles of general consumption, as well as raw materials.Mr. Oliver, the Premier of British Columbia, strongly opposed the resolution, claiming that the platform should be in general terms and not specific. He moved an amendment to the effect that all necessities of life, together with all tools, implements, and machinery necessary for the ^development of the natural resources, should be placed in the free list. The amendment was defeated by an overwhelming majority.Mr. Langley, the Minister of Agriculture in Saskatchewan, supporting the resolution, said that the Western farmers had borne all the burdens of the tariff in the past and received none of the benefits. There was no doubt that the tariff was one of the chief causes of the cost of living.An additional tariff platform of the Convention reiterated belief in reciprocity, and a resolution was moved by Mr. Fielding, who negotiated the pact of 1911 with the United States, expressing regret that the Borden Government had not accepted the agreement, which he believed was in the best interest of the country. The Convention placed on record its appreciation of the objects of the agreement audits faith in the principles of the friendly international relations underlying it. The hope was expressed that a favourable moment might come when there would be a renewed manifestation by the two Governments of the desire to make arrangements.Imperial Sea Communications. In reply to a telegram from the : British Government, the Canadian Government have telegraphed that they agree to the expediency of appointing a Committee to deal with Imperial Sea Communications, and they have nominated Mr. A. K. Maclean (Minister without Portfolio) as their representative.Canadian-owned Ships: Dissatisfaction in Dominion.- The Prime Minister of the Dominion (Sir Robert Borden) has called the attention of the British Government to the dissatisfaction existing in Canada regarding the policy and action of the British Ministry of Shipping, particularly in respect of ships owned in Canada but registered in the United Kingdom. The case of the Bilbster is specifically mentioned; and it is submitted that any necessity for refusing transfer to the Canadian registry of British registered ships owned in Canada (which existed during the war) no longer prevails, and that permission for the transfer to Canadian registry of ships owned by Canadian interests should be given at once.United States Industrial Concerns. The Director of Information at Ottawa reported on August 7th that there was still a marked tendency for United States&apos; industrial concerns to locate branches in Canada.Trade with United Kingdom and United&apos;-States. Imports into Canada frOm the United Kingdom during the 12 months ended June 30th were $75,000,000, as compared with $72,000,000 for the year ended June 1918. Imports from the United States amounted to $ 696,000,000, a decline of $64,000,000 during the same period.Capital and Labour. A Conference of representatives of employees and employers will be held in the capjital at an early date to consider questions relating generally to capital and labour.Trades Congress and &quot; One Big Union.&quot; In reply to a protest against the selection of the Labour delegates for the Industrial Conference at Ottawa in September by officers of the Dominion Trades Congress, Mr. Tom Moore, the President, said: &quot; The International Trade Unions and the Trades and Labour Congress of Canada do nOt recognise the &apos; One Big Union &apos; as a Labour organisation, and, so far as we are concerned, would refuse absolutely to sit in such a conference if repre-sentatives of organisations not affiliated with the International Trade Unions, the American Federation of Labour, or the Trades and Labour Congress of Canada were officially represented.&quot;8709-2a A 2
AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH. &apos;Parliament and Peace Treaty-la reply to a telegram on this subject, the Prime Alinister of the Commonwealth (Air. Hughes) informed the British Government bv telegram from Durban, dated August 6th, that he proposed to lav the Treaty of Peace before Parliament for ratification. The Governor-General of the Commonwealth has been requested by the British Government to telegraph the earliest date on which the formal assent of Parliament to the ratification may be expected.Seamen&apos;s Strike. Negotiations are in progress between the Seamen&apos;s Executive and the Federal Government for settlement of the strike. The prosecutions of union officials have been adjourned pending the expectation of an early resumption of work.Government of Pacific Islands-It is publicly announced that the Common-wealth Government have appointed a Commission to visit New Guinea and to report on the best system for the future Government of German New Guinea, based on the system oritlined by the Federal Government. The Commission will also make similar investigations regarding the other ex-German islands.A- A NEW ZEALAND.I Parliament and Elections. It is announced that Parliament will meet on August 2.8th and the elections are expected to take place later in the year.Naval Defence. Speaking at Auckland, the Prime Alinister (Mr. Massey) is reported to have said the Dominion&apos;s subsidy of 100,000Z. to the British Navy would henceforth go towards the upkeep of the cruiser Canterbury, which the Admiralty had promised. A sloop of about 3,000 tons for training purposes was also arranged. He added that the Admiralty had practically decided to station several light cruisers near the Dominion as a sub-squadron to the China fleet, with probably New Zealand as the headquarters. .... . . .  .&apos; Dominion Press and Party Truce. In welcoming Mr. Massey ancl Sir Joseph Ward on their return to Wellington, the Dominion says:--&quot; The imperfect truce which party ambitions and artificial animosities unduly limited during the war needs broadening into an effective working union. The first essential condition for averting the danger threatening New Zealand is a plain and unequivocal declaration by the leaders recognising the need for a new political order.&quot;The Post observes:   &quot;Conditions have materially changed since May, when Liberals resolved to discontinue the compact. The peace appears to be more unstable than was expected, and economic and political unrest is rampant everywhere. Great Britain&apos;s troubles are alone sufficient severely to strain our endurance ancl statesman-ship unless speedily checked. Similar troubles may be expected here unless Parliament offers relief, which is impossible under conditions of party strife. A Unique crisis offers our leaders a unique opportunity.&quot;SOUTH AFRICA.Parliament and Peace Treaty. The Union Ministers informed the British Government by telegram received on August 7th that they considered the Peace Treaty should be submitted to Parliament for approval, and that they were prepared to summon Parliament before the end of August for the purpose.&quot; The Ministers expressed the hope that, with a view to securing uniformity, it might be possible to submit suggestions as to the form in which the Peace Treaty should receive Parliamentary approval in the Dominions, viz., as to whether approval should be given in the form of a Bill (on the lines of that submitted to the British Parliament) or a motion. In reply, the Secretary of State for the Colonies by telegram of August 7th pointed out that the matter was one for the decision of the Local Government, but that he considered the best course was to obtain approval of the Treaty by Resolution of both Houses.   He added that if (as-was probable) legislation
on the lines of the British Bill should he required, in order to give effect to the Treaty, this would naturally follow&apos; as/a-con sequence oi such Resolution.It is announced in the Press-that the&quot; Union Parliament has been summoned to meet on September 5th. . --. c-&apos;     - &apos; -; : &apos;-----&apos;--/-/,General. Botha and Need of Ships: Suggested Conferences-General Botha-and General Smuts were entertained to luncheon on August 5th by the Administrator of the Cape Province, Sir F. de Waal, the guests numbering 400. General Botha, in his speech, emphasised that South Africa&apos;s great need Avas ships. He suggested that the time had come for&quot; a conference of Dominion representatives regarding a Dominion shipping line, and&apos; announced that three German prize ships had been allocated to South Africa. These ships, which were cargo vessels, would be utilised for the conveyance of coal from South Africa. He hoped that the Imperial Government would allow South Africa to retain the 13 prize ships taken in South African waters. Referring optimistically to the future development of South Africa, General Botha appealed to the captains of industry who made money in the&apos;countly to spend It in-South Africa. In this respect he warmly commended the&apos;recent example of -Messrs/ .I agger and- Garlack in making a donation of 30,00()L and 20,000?.&apos; respectively towards the extension of the work in the&apos; University of Cape Town. &apos;&quot;&apos;-*&apos; !General Smuts and World-PosHion of British Empire. -General &quot;Smuts in his speech at the function to which reference is made in the preceding paragraph, laid particular emphasis on the three outstanding;impressions which he had received at the Paris: Conference.   Firstly, he referred to the immense preponderance of the British Empire in the world.    &quot;They who in days gone-by had felt its mighty hand,&quot; the General said, &quot; always- had -a respect for the British Empire, but the Conference brought out most clearly not only the material but also the political and moral preponderance of the Empire, which was- the most potent instrument for, good or evil existing in the world.&quot;     When they were thrashing out the League of Nations; he continued, it was the precedents of the British constitution which gave; the best guidance.   The second impression was of the rising power of America,; which he described as the only great power to emerge from the-war unscathed and: -even with resources vastly increased.   Thirdly, the decline of old Europe; not only relatively but intrinsically owing to war exhaustion.    General Smuts added that the clay of the young peoples had arrived, and no one had greater prospects for the future than South Africa. &quot;Soidh Africa as a Republic: General Smuts&apos; Comparison.- Generals Botha and Smuts received an enthusiastic welcome on their arrival at Pretoria.General Smuts&apos; commenting on the Republican propaganda, emphatically declared: that though he loved the late Republic, of which he had been a servant, South Africa&apos; stood to-day much higher than in the lifetime of the Republic. &apos;     -&apos;;.&apos;&quot;    &quot;   &apos;Indian Grievances. The Indian Congress at J ohannesburg terminated on August 8th. Twenty-one resolutions were passed dealing with various Indian grievances and disabilities, including the immigration laws, franchise railway regulations, trading rights and education, and particularly demanding the withdrawal of the proclamation declaring that Asiatics are prohibited immigrants, and the removal of the restrictions on the movements ot Indians with in: the provincial boundaries. ,INDIA.Economic Prospects. The Viceroy reported to the India Office on August 8th that the condition and prospects- of the crops continued favourable. The relief operations in Barabanki, Budaun and the Jhansi districts of the United Provinces, the test works in the Bikaner State of Rajputana, and the relief works in the Panch Mahals district, and village works in the Ranch Mahals and Rewra Ivantha districts of the Bombay Presidenc3&apos;- had been closed. The numbers relieved were as follovfs :-Bengal: relief works, 6,346; test works, 90; gratuitous relief,  0,445. Bihar and Orissa : relief works, 1,010 ; test works, 3,093 ; gratuitous relief, 41,876. Feudatory States of Orissa: test works, 9,895 ; gratuitous relief, 29,309. United Provinces.: test works, 286; gratuitous relief, 20,157.

Bombay : relief works,  22 293-dependants, 13,122 ; village works, 2,066 ; test works, 630-; gratuitous relief, 76.396&apos; Hyderabad figures not, reported.   Madras: relief works, 30,621; test works, I486-    i gratuitous relief, 85,225 (incomplete figures). &apos; %. Calcutta University Commission. Tbe report of tbe Calcutta University Corn-mission, presided over by Sir Michael Sadler, published on August 9th, reviews the present state Of secondary, university and professional education in Bengal, with a population of 40 millions.The report is divided into two parts. Part I., which occupies three volumes gives a detailed survey and criticism of existing conditions, while Part Ik, in two volumes, works out a far-reaching programme of reform.Among the outstanding features of tbe reforms XDroposed are :  -(1) The establishment of a wholly new system of administration for secondary and higher secondary education, calculated to bring into effective co-operation the chief interests concerned.&apos;(2) The creation of a new type of institution to be known as the Intermediate College, which will take over the work now covered by the first two years of the university course, dealing with, it by^school and not by university methods of teaching, and providing not only preparation for the university but vocational training. This the Commissioners regard as the pivot of their whole scheme.(3) Far-reaching changes in the organisation of the teaching profession both for school work and for university work ; changes which may result in the gradual supersession of the service system of recruitment (save for special branches of work) by a professional organisation of teackers in Government a&quot;d privately managed schools.(4) The immediate establishment of a new university at Decca.(5) A complete reorganisation of the resources for university teaching in Calcutta on lines which will make possible the creation of a genuine-teaching university.(6) A special organisation for the encouragement of women&apos;s education.(7) Improvement of the conditions of student life and a systematic handling of the problem of finding- more ample sites for educational work in Calcutta.Tke fiftk volume contains a chapter on the relations which should be established between the universities of Bengal and the Imperial and provincial Governments, together with a suggestive discussion of the possibility of developing inter-university relations between the various parts of the British Empire.. Private Imports of Gold and- Silver. At the annual meeting of the Bank of Bombay the chairman urged that the ordinances prohibiting private imports of gold and silver should be revoked, as their continuance creates a demand for money in silver instead of bar gold and bar silver, which people want, but are unable to get. This demand, said the chairman, resulted in an unnecessary and uncalled-for addition to the rupee currency, with an inflating influence on prices. India as a creditor country could easily draw the bar gold and silver she wants.
