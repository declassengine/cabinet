BRITISH  EMPIRE   AND   AFRICA  REPORT.IMPERIAL AFFAIRS.British Empire Delegation. At a.meeting of the British Empire Delegation held on March 13th, 1919 (B.E.D. 13), the League of Nations Covenant was discussed more especially in relation to the Admiralty Memorandum regarding clause 8 of the Covenant.The subject of mandates was also considered at this meeting in special relation to Lord Milner&apos;s Memorandum (W.C.P. 211). It was decided that clause 6 of Appendix I. of the Memorandum should be deleted, and that Mr. Hughes should propose a draft in substitution.The future of Nauru was also considered, and Mr. Hughes undertook to circulate a Memorandum on the subject. (This Memorandum was subsequently circulated (W.C.P. 240) and in the course of it the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth pointed out that he had received a cable from his Government referring him to a previous cable of December, very strongly urging him to press the claims of Australia to the control of Nauru.)The subject of indemnities and reparation was also considered by the Delegation at the above meeting. It was decided that the British representatives on the Reparation Commission should not commit themselves to the proposition that Italy or Poland should come in for a share of the German indemnity.SELF-GOVERNING   DOMINIONS.CANADA.League of Nations. A Memorandum on the Covenant of the League of Nations by the Prime Minister of the Dominion (Sir Robert Borden) has been circulated (W.C.P. 245).Dominions Status as a Nation: Voice in External Affairs. The external relations of the Dominion and her status among the nations of the British Empire was referred to at some length by the President of the Privy Council (Mr. N. W. Rowell) in the course of the debate in Parliament last week. Mr. Rowell recalled the fact that the German Empire and the Dominion of Canada came unto being on the same day, July 1st, 1867, and mentioned that while Germany with a large population and small area adopted an autocratic form of Government, Canada, on the other hand, with a large territory and a small population, devoted her energies to subduing natural obstacles. The conclusion of the great struggle, he said, found Canada in the position -of one of the really effective nations of the world at the Peace Conference, while Germanj&apos;&apos; was of no moment.Mr. Rowell then pointed out that at the first Imperial Conference in 1897 Canada was represented by Sir Wilfrid Laurier, Avho on that occasion first claimed for Canada the status of a nation. He said that there had been a belief by a large number of people previous to 1911 that Canada was merely a colony. In 1911 representatives of the Dominion were admitted for the first time into a full knowledge of the foreign affairs of Great Britain.
After explaining the functions of the Imperial War Cabinet, the Minister proceeded to say that Canadian autonomy had been enlarged, remarking that Canada had reached the status of a nation, not in name but in fact. It was inconceivable that Canada should continue in a position where she had no voice in the affairs of the Empire.Sir Sam Hughes asked where were the responsibilities of the Colonies.Mr. Rowell answered : &quot; In the Imperial War Cabinet, which was created to deal with questions affecting war. The question of constitutional relations will be settled at a conference after the war.&quot;Mr. E. W. Nesbitt asked if in the case of. the Canadian representative not agreeing with other representatives he would not have to return to secure the consent of his own Parliament. &quot;Absolutely,&quot; replied Mr. Rowell. &quot;Representatives are re-sponsible to their own Governments.&quot; Continuing, he said that Canada had been claiming the status of a nation since 1897, but did not get that status till. 1917. Under the old style, if the Premier, of Canada wished to communicate with the Premier of Britain, the despatch had to be handed to the Governor-General, who sent it to the Colonial Office, from where it was sent to the British Premier. At the Conference of 1917, a change was agreed upon as the result of a resolution proposed by Mr. Hughes, the Prime Minister of Australia. Now the Prime Ministers of Britain and the Dominions could communicate direct on matters of Cabinet importance. That was another recognition of Canada&apos;s status as a nation resulting from the war. He declared that the British Empire was the greatest experiment of free democratic Government which had ever existed. It was composed of a number of autonomous nations owing allegiance to a single King.The late Sir Wilfrid Laurier and the &quot;Status of the Dominion. -The Canadian Statesman publishes a statement from Mr. John S. Ewart, K.C., the leader of a movement to make Canada an independent kingdom under the British Sovereign, in which he quotes from two letters written by Sir Wilfrid Laurier.. In one letter, dated September 1st, 1906, referring to a speech by Mr. Ewart at Winnipeg, Sir Wilfrid Laurier said: &quot;You have taken what seems to me the true line in the complicated problem with which you have dealt.&quot; Writing again on June 17th, 1918, in reference to Mr. Ewart&apos;s book The Kingdom of Canada, Sir Wilfrid Laurier said : &quot;Need I tell you how gratifying it is to me that my views are so much akin to yours.&quot;Mr. Ewart describes the alleged efforts of Mr. Joseph Chamberlain and other British statesmen to involve Sir Wilfrid Laurier in Imperial projects, and says : &quot; Repeated objection to such proposals was, of course, very difficult. The Premiers of other Dominions were not equal to the task. Sir Wilfrid Laurier alone presented an impregnable defence behind the barricade of self-government for Canada.&quot;Mr. Fielding and the Union Government. Mr. W. S. Fielding, formerly Minister of Finance in the Laurier Administration, who was elected for Queen&apos;s and Shelbume constituency in 1917 on pledging himself to support the Union Government during the war, spoke in the debate on the Address in the House of. Commons.The former Minister, whose speech lasted for three hours, declared himself to be an independent supporter of the Union Government, but stated he was prepared to criticise certain of its policies. He advocated a reduction in the tariff and condemned the War-time Elections Act, which he characterised as &quot; un-British.&quot; He also took strong exception to the absence of Sir Robert Borden. at the Peace Conference, declaring that Canada had no territorial axe to grind, and that the Prime MinisteFs place was at home.He declared that he did not think a change of administration in Canada was desirable under existing conditions, adding, &quot; I don&apos;t think my Liberal friends have brought about that degree of unanimity which I believe to be essential to success.&quot; He believed the Union Government was sincerely endeavouring to meet the difficulties at the present time and he announced his intention of voting against any amendment to the Address should the Leader of the Opposition decide to present one.He did not see the need of a Dominion referendum on the subject of prohibition,, saying that the plebiscite should be left to the Provinces.Demobilisation Problems. -In surveying some of the problems of demobilisation in Parliament last week, the Minister of Militia (General S. C. Mewburn) outlinecL
what the Government had done in anticipation Of the end of the war, instancing the establishment of the Military Hospitals Commission&apos; early in 1916, the Department of Soldiers&apos; Civil Re-establishment and other branches that assist the soldiers back to health and comfortable employment. Every effort, he said, was made by the Militia Department to provide transportation facilities to bring home as many men as possible, but lack of ocean tonnage and the fact that during the winter months the railways were declared to be unable to handle more than 30,000 men a month, were deterrent factors in the situation. When the summer set in, General-Mewburn stfted they would be able to increase the number returning to 50,000 a.month- bv utilising the ports of Montreal and Quebec. &quot; Everything is being speeded up, and it is hoped to have everyone home by early in August,&quot; the Minister added.He referred to the marriage&apos;of over 25,000 Canadian soldiers overseas, and said that all possible was being done to secure the maximum of comfort for the brides of the men. .. . ., - -   .   . ; -. -Returned Soldiers and Land. The Chairman of the Settlement Board (Mr. W. V. Black) has informed a meeting of Members of Parliament that many returned soldiers are taking advantage of the Government scheme of land settlement. Mr. Black said that the applicants were of a fine type, generally possessing farming experience, and provided with a fair amount of capital. Three hundred and seventy men had been placed in Manitoba during the last three weeks, while 1,200 had sought loans averaging $1,400 each. A total amount of $1,680,000 had been advanced in this manner. A large percentage of the men possessed capital ranging from $ 500 to $2,000 each.Immigrants entering Dominion. Immigrants to the total of 79,074 entered Canada during last year. Of these, 71,314 came from the United States, the balance arriving at the ocean ports. The highest point in immigration was reached in 1913, when 402,432 persons entered the Dominion, and of this number 150,542 were British citizens and 139,900 United States citizens. &apos;From the United States three men entered the Dominion for every woman, but at the ocean ports more women arrived than men.Asiatic Immigration.-!^ is reported in the Press that an agitation is beginning in British Columbia to restrict Asiatic immigration. It is alleged that Chinese are entering the Province at the rate of 300 a month, while, despite the agreement with Japan which permits no more than 400 Japanese to enter Canada in a year, during the last two years 1,700 Japanese entered the country. It is stated that even the Chinese Consul at Vancouver is advising that no more Chinese be admitted, and that the head tax be returned to all those deported since the signing of the Armistice.Prohibition. The Acting Prime Minister (Sir Thomas White), in replying to a deputation which waited upon him on March 15th to urge the policjr of prohibition, is reported to have stated that the Government would validate by legislation the war measure of prohibition, banning the manufacture and importation of intoxicating liquors-- for one year after the official declaration of peace. He said that the Govern-ment were considering the question of then submitting the matter to a referendum.British Citizenship.-Certificates of naturalisation and of re-admission to British citizenship were granted in Canada to 9,029 persons during the fiscal year ended March 31st, 1918. This number included 471 Austrians, 43 Germans, 240 French, 170 Belgians, 107 Japanese, 406 Norwegians, 1,163 Russians, and 5,192 Americans.Restrictions on Imports. The Dominion Minister of Immigration and Colonisation reported on March 14th that the announcement in the Canadian House of Commons by the Acting Prime Minister (Sir Thomas White) to the effect that all restrictions on imports from Canada had been lifted by Great Britain was received with applause from both sides of the House and with the liveliest satisfaction throughout the Dominion. The Acting Prime &quot;Minister, in making the statement, said he was glad to say that he was in a position to satisfy the House that there had been no intention on the part of the Mother Country to discriminate against Canada.Demand for Returned Soldiers. According&apos; to a statement issued by the Toronto Branch-&apos;of- the Canadian Manufacturers&apos; Association, the demand by members of the Association for returned soldiers now exceeds the supply.   This is quite the reverse
Crorn what was thought a few weeks ago to be likely to develop into a somewhat serious problem. The Association, in order to meet the situation,&apos;some time ago invited the. co-operation of the soldiers&apos; organisation, which was\ readily extended,/ with satisfactory results.- AUST italian COMMONWEALTH.Claim to Control Nauru.- A reference to the claims of the Commonwealth to the control of Nauru will be found under the heading &quot; Imperial Affairs.&quot;Vocational Training. The Federal Cabinet have approved the extension o  vocational training and sustenance to soldiers who enlisted under the age of 20. The scheme has previously been applied only to men unable to follow their pre-war employment. It is estimated that the scheme covers 17,000 men, but that only half are likely to participate, and that the cost of training and sustenance is 1501. per head, a total of 1,300,OOOl. in a three years scheme.Fruit Pool.-The Federal Government have refused to form a fruit pool, and shipments are being left to private agents.Rainfall. There has been a good general rain in Victoria, Tasmania, North-East New-South Wales and Queensland. In the far inland districts of Queensland the drought has been broken up. The heaviest rainfall recorded in Melbourne for 50 years has taken place. Alore than 100 houses have been flooded and damaged, and streets have been torn up.SOUTH AFRICA.Proceedings in Parliament : Budget: League of Nations : Industrial Problems.  In the course of the Budget debate on March 7th Mr. Merriman vigorously criticised the increase in the personnel of the Civil Service. He condemned the inclusion of the proceeds from the super tax, which was a war measure, in the ordinary revenue instead of its being applied to war expenditure. He also opposed the extra taxation of the diamond industry, especially at a time when the Government had set up a rival in the shape of the company recently formed to dredge for diamonds round Pomona Island, the contract regarding which was recently the subject of considerable criticism. He advocated retrenchment instead of taxation which was inopportune. The Govern-ment&apos;s policy, he declared, would frighten away capital, and it was ruining the prospects of the country. Mr. Alerriman proceeded to ridicule the League of Nations, saying : &quot; We are handing over our allegiance to a nebulous body, composed of all kinds of fellows never heard of until six months ago who are to have the power to issue a mandate to say how we are to govern the country. Mr. Wilson is a remarkable man brim full of lofty ideas, but just ask him to take over South-West Africa or German East Africa and he won&apos;t touch it. He, like most of us, is sitting down telling people what they ought to do.&quot; Mr. Merriman also dealt with the industrial position, declaring that if the workers thought they were going to dominate the country they were mistaken. He viewed the present state of affairs with the gravest alarm. The Acting Premier (Mr. Malan) followed wdth a statement on the industrial position. He urged that more attention must be devoted to industrial problems than in the past. Although the Conciliation Bill of 1914 had failed to pass the House, the Government had urged its principles on employers of labour, and with a considerable measure of success. The time had come, he said, seriously to consider the questions of hours and wages, the colour bar, and the conditions of employment generally. The Government had decided to appoint a small Corn-mission to investigate closely these questions, issuing interim reports to jorevent delay. Mr. Malan emphasised that the colour bar was the result of public opinion. The only legal colour bar wras in certain classes of mining. The sole result of the present situation would be that the coloured people would form their own Trade Union. The right wav was for the Government to recognise the Trade Unions, and bring the labour leaders into contact with the employers. Referring to the present disputes. Mr. Alalan stated that there was hope that the contending parties in the building trades would come together at another round table conference. The Conciliation Board had been working most satisfactorily for a considerable time, and disputes wrere being amicably settled when, the machinery suddenly broke down.7570-3a B     - ,
In conclusion Mr. Malan referred to the small coterie at Johannesburg which was-stirring up a class war and also utilising the coloured workers to this end. He strongly emphasised that it was incumbent upon the leaders cf organised labour to assist the Government in rooting out the agitators who were creating so much mischief.The debate was adj adjourned.Earlier in the debate the Nationalist member, Mr. Fichardt, moved an amendment referring the estimates to a Select Committee for the purpose of the equalisation of revenue and expenditure. The Leader of the Labour Party (Colonel Creswell) moved a further amendment urging that the distribution of wealth should bear a more just - proportion to the services rendered by citizens, and also urging the discharge by the country of its obligations in seeing that none of its members who were willing to work should be allowed to fall below civilised standards of living&quot;Nationalist Deputation. The Nationalist deputation have forwarded to the Governor-General a reply (which has been published) to Admiral FitzHerberts memorandum. This reply disclaims responsibility for the decision to refuse the offer of a passage to Europe by H.M.S. Minerva. It states that no imputation was ever made or intended that Admiral FitzIIerbert&apos;s original offer of passages hy the Minerva was not genuine, but maintains that there was evidence of a desire that the deputation should not act upon the acceptance of the invitation. The letter-admits that Admiral FitzHerbert mentioned to General Hertzog a desire&apos; that the ship should be inspected, but this was not regarded as a condition precedent to acceptance. In any case General Hertzog informed Admiral -FitzHerbert that the question of personal comfort did not count so long as the deputation reached its destination. The letter states that no request to visit Admiral FitzHerbert was conveyed to them, and maintains the assertion that the delegates were informed that Admiral FitzHerbert was too busy to see them. The deputation concurs with the report; of the visit to the Minerva in every respect, but the secretary does not understand how his letter of February 20th could be construed as an intimation that the accommodation proved inadequate, and considers that the only fair meaning of the le tter was that the delegates undoubtedly would not intrude /their presence where it appeared not to be desired. The Admiral&apos;s assumption was therefore incorrect. The letter adds that as Rear-Admiral Hill and Captain Raikes were specialty deputed to act for Admiral FitzHerbert, and as the latteks offer was undoubtedly regarded as genuine, the necessity or expediency of General Hertzog seeing him finally is not apparent. - .-It is-stated that as the Dutch steamer Baioean with the South African Nationalist deputation on board steamed out of the harbour three cheers were given for the delegates, and a Dutch Nationalist song was sung, to which a number of dock-workers responded by giving three cheers for the &quot; Union Jack &quot; and three cheers for the &quot; Union Constitution.&quot;European Strikers and Coloured Workers. A development of the strike situation occurred on March 6th at Johannesburg, when the European strikers compelled 100 coloured men to come out. The Trade Unions did not support the coloured men, with the result that they went to the City Hall for food. A packed meeting of coloured workers called by the African Political Organisation was then held, and passed a resolution recording its profound sense of disappointment at the hostile spirit and attitude of members of the white labour unions towards unorganised coloured labour. It was resolved to discuss ways and means of organising&apos; coloured labour with a view to securing for coloured workers their just rights and privileges in the arena of skilled and unskilled labour.INDIA.Legislation on Sedition Committee Report. The report of the Select Committee on the Emergency Powers Bill (vide Reports Nos. 104 and 108) was presented to the Imperial Legislative Council on March 1st! The report was not signed by the Pundit Malaviya, Mr. Khaparde, or Mr. Patel three National Congress members of the
Committee. Mr. Siirendranath Banerjee, Mr. Sastri, arid Khan Bahadur Shan, three Moderates, though signing the document, submitted a minute of dissent, stating that they still disapproved of the policy and principles of the Bill and reserved&quot; their right to oppose it altogether. It is stated that the Government concession to limit the duration of the Bill to three years has not conciliated opposition. The Committee propose that, the title of the Bill should be &quot; Anarchical and Revolutionary Crimes Act,&quot; and that its various parts should be applied only when the Governor-General in Council is satisfied that anarchical or revolutionary movements are beino- promoted or are involved, A number of amendments are made, but it is maintained that the main scheme of the Bill is not materially altered.A number of members of the^ Legislative Council have issued a manifesto dissociating themselves from the passive resistance movement set on foot against the Sedition Bills. They state that they take this action in the best interests of the country, and especially of the reform- proposals. The manifesto, however, condemns the Bills as drastic and unnecessary, and the signatories declare that they&apos; think that they must oppose them to the end.OTHER COLONIES, PROTECTORATES, &amp;c.EGYPT.Features of the Situation-Sir M. Cheetham reported on March 11th that there had been a recurrence of rioting in several parts of Cairo, but that troops had effectively dealt with the trouble. He also reported that a strike of advocates had occurred, which prevented the Native Courts in the Provinces from sitting. On March 12th the condition of Cairo was reported as normal, though there had been disorder in Tantah, but on March 13th there was more rioting.On March 15th disturbances in Cairo continued, and some loss of life resulted ; the telegraph lines were cut, apparently with the object of isolating Cairo and the railway line from Tantah to Monoid&apos;. Sir M. Cheetham said that the members of the late Cabinet, with whom he had discussed the reconstruction of the Ministry, all put forward the suggestion that the delegates of the advanced party should be free to accompany those Ministers who might proceed to London. He reported that the leaders of Azhar were opposed to the movements of the students, but that the Sheikh of Azhar was finding it difficult to assert his authority and that, religious excitement, if aroused, would probably spread to the Fellaheen, who had not hitherto been in the movement. Under the circumstances, and in view of a probable memorial from the Sheikhs and Ulemas of Azhar, Sir M. Cheetham asked for guidance as to whether His Majesty&apos;s Government could contemplate the possibility of the extremist leaders being allowed to leave Egypt. A later telegram of the same date from Sir M. Cheetham. reported that all communications with Upper Egypt were interrupted, that the men in the railway repair shops in Cairo had struck work and that the refusal of the native Bar to attend in the Courts had become- general. The facts, he said, pointed to a grave situation, and the General Officer Commanding in Egypt agreed that a large number of troops would be necessary to maintain communications and guarantee the food of Cairo. The great danger was an outbreak of fanaticism, and Sir M. Cheetham asked for an urgent answer to the question of the departure of Egyptians to England.On March 16th Tantah and Cairo were reported quiet, but disturbances had occurred in ZagazigyMansura and Beni Suef. Railway and telegraphic communica-tious were interrupted in the Delta and Upper Egypt, and the mibtary were endeavouring to restore the line. Alexandria Cairo, which had been again cut. British and Egyptian observers stated that the agitation, combined with sabotage and destruction, was unlike any previous outbreak. Sir M. Cheetham believed there were not enough troops to ensure the necessary communications. General Bulfin proposed to safeguard railway communications with Alexandria, and, if possible, to keep up the line to Port Said, though it was impossible at the same time to restore communication with Upper Egypt, from whence there was practically no news. General Bulfin expressed the view that it was necessary to form an Egyptian7570-3o c
Ministry to co-operate with the Army in pacifying the country, but it was explained by Sir M. Cheetham that the difficulty was to get Egyptians to take office under present circumstances.On March 16th Sir M. Gheetham arranged that the extremists should receive another warning, aud General Watson sent for the extremist leaders and said he must hold them responsible for organised violence and sabotage resulting from their propaganda.Amongst the alternative courses submitted by Sir M. Cheetham to His Majesty&apos;s Government occur the suggestions of the publication of a statement that the Peace Conference recognised the British Protectorate over Egypt, or that all restrictions on the departure of Egyptians should be removed. He admitted the possibility of, grave objections to the latter course, but suggested that it was impossible to ignore the strength of the sentiment which supported the deputation. He said that he was impressed by the militaiy situation and the fact of having to abandon Upper Egypt.In a telegram of March 17th the Foreign Office pointed out to Sir M. Cheetham that the question of the Nationalist leaders coming to Europe was not so much one of inconvenience but of the present and future effect in the country. It was observed that these leaders had committed themselves to the policy of severing the British connection and that there was, therefore, no common ground for discussion. Further, to permit them to proceed after recent events would make it appear that His Majesty&apos;s Government were yielding to force after persuasion had failed. Sir M. Cheetham was instructed to concentrate efforts on the restoration of law and order, and to do his utmost to rally reasonable elements.On March 18th Sir M. Cheetham reported that there was no communication with Upper Egypt beyond Wasta where the trouble was serious. The natives were constantly destroying railway lines and telegraph wires in numerous districts. Between Cairo, Alexandria, and Port Said various stations were burnt, signal-boxes destroyed, and rails removed. The only communication between Cairo and the Provinces is by wireless and aeroplane.FOREIGN COLONIES, &amp;c. IN AFRICA.GERMAN COLONIES.Views of General von L-Mow-Vorbech. -General von Lettow-Vorbeck has given an interview to the Rotterdam correspondent of the Vossische Zeitung. Referring to the past and future of German East Africa, the General said that for several reasons he found it difficult to believe that Germany&apos;s enemies would deprive her of the colony. In the first place, it would be a distinct case of robbery. It would mean depriving the German planters of all they possessed. He did not believe that the English were capable of this.In the second place, he did not think that the Entente would be so short-sighted as to deprive Germany of every outlet for her superfluous population. Such a policy would be productive of.serious unrest due to want of employment.As an excuse for their line of action, Germany^s enemies maintain that the Germans are not capable of governing the natives and treat them with brutality. Existing facts prove this assertion to be false. If the natives had been oppressed by the Germans, would they have continued fighting for them when the latter were no longer in a position to oppress them ? But they fought well for the Germans, not only the Ascari, but all of them. They fought on even when it was clear that the Germans must succumb to the superior numbers of their enemies.In reply to those who say that the Germans are incapable of colonising, the -General referred to the state of the country, to the rice plantations and crops of sweet potatoes. Although the country was now devastated, there was a good future before it, and he could not believe that Germany was to be deprived of her honest work.Other Views. Franz Kolbe in Deutsche Politik, February 14th, says : &quot; The German nation need not despair of recovering her colonies. Dr. Richard Hennig has discovered by historical investigation that in all her wars England has robbed her
enemies of a greater or less part of their colonies, but that there has never been a peace in which she has not altogether or partially restored them. Accordingly we hope that our negotiators at the Conference will remember this and work for the recovery of our colonies with the energy of their predecessors.&quot;In Der Tag oi February 25th Professor H. Grossmann strongly protests against the idea of robbing a seventy million people of its colonial activity, &quot;and in opposition to Point 5 of President Wilson&apos;s programme.The Socialist attitude is&apos; represented by Hans Grim in Vossische Zeitunq of February 25th. He gives two reasons why General Smuts and England are so anxious to obtain the union of German South-West Africa with the Dominion, a union which the Dominion itself, he says, is far from desiring. The first is that the South African Dominion does not possess sufficient land for all its inhabitants and that a landless, discontented class,&apos; both black and white, is developing, and showing marked anti-capitalist tendencies which are at the same time anti-English. If this class could be supplied with new land, social conflict might be delayed in South Africa.But the writer asserts that the desire to separate South-West Africa from Socialist Germany is more especially urging England to acquire the German colony. There must be no colonies for Germany because she is socialist, and particularly none on the border of the richest gold country in the world. England has always hated German socialism, even more than the phantom to which she gave the name of German Imperialism. Therefore it is not the South African State which demands the former German colony, but English capitalist interests.
