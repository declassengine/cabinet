SECRET.APPRECIATION OF THE . ATTACHED -REPORT No. 1J5.BRITISH  EMPIRE  AND AFRICA.Imperial Affairs. Attention is called to the proceedings of the British Empire Delegation.Canada.The appointment of the Canadian Delegates at. the Peace Conference as pieuipo-tentiaries to sign the Peace Treaty on behalf of Canada marks a new epoch in the political status of the Dominion.The figures relating to war expenditure should be noted.The position of the Dominion as a lending country and the financial relations with the British Government have been&apos;made clear in the Dominion Parliament.The discussion in Parliament, with regard to military defaulters showed some considerable differences of opinion.The Quebec attitude towards prohibition may have the effect of modifying legislation in the Dominion.Newfoundland.It appears that the General Election will not take place until the autumn.Australian Commonwealth.Ministerial comments upon English shipping companies in relation to Australian trade should receive attention.The attitude of Labour towards Peace celebrations and other matters in New South Wales indicates the influence of extremists.The &quot; One Big Union&quot; scheme is apparently not receiving sufficient support to involve its acceptance in the various States.   .New Zealand.It seems that the soldiers&apos; vote in the referendum will turn the scale against prohibition.India.The rioting discloses a more serious state of affairs than was at first anticipated. The llowlatt Bills can only be considered as forming a convenient pretext for the disturbances.Other Colonies, Protectorates, &amp;c.The telegrams from Egypt show that while order has in a great measure been restored, local disturbances still occur.    A serious feature is the strike of Government
employees. There is distinct evidence of a growth of Bolshevism in the movement and an insidious propaganda is obviously being carried on. The new Ministry are alive to the dangers of a continuance of the present unrest.Foreign Colonies in Africa.There is clearly an effort being made in Germany to stimulate interest in Colonial matters.H. d&apos;E.April 16th, 1919.

Convention ^j^D % *ubiectwas again considered at the meeting of the delegates on Apnl 9th (B.EX19) and aSoaTtlie meeting on April 12th (B.E.D. 20). Other questions discussed a, the d-^tt^SSti^ixiclufed the disposition of the P^rf^m^m territories belonging to the Allies, or territories transferred to them undei tlie Treaty of Peace ;and the draft Convention on International Air Navigation.SELF-GOVERNING   DOMINIONS.. - .     CANADA.Signatures for Peace Treaty. In the House of Commons last week an Order-in-Council was presented naming Sir Robert Borden, Sir George Poster, Mr. 0. J. Doherty, hnd Mr. A. L. Siftoh as plenipotentiaries to sign the Peace Treaty on behalf of Canada. The Order states that the plenipotentiaries are named &quot; to sign for and in the name of His Majesty the King in respect of the Dominion of Canada everything agreed upon and to conclude and transact all such other matters as may pertain thereto.&quot;The Acting Prime Minister (Sir Thomas White) was asked if he had any information as to when the Treaty would be signed and he answered in the negative. He also intimated, in reply to a further question, that the Treaty would not be submitted to the Canadian Parliament before it was signed.Cost of the War.-In Committee of Supply last week the Dominion House ofCommons was informed that the total war expenditure of the Dominion was $1,277,273,848.The amounts expended in each of the years that hostilities lasted were as follows : -1914-15   -      -   60,750,476 1917-18   - -   343,836,8011915-16   -      -166,197,755 .1918-19   - -   4TO,t3O0/0U0 1916-17   -      - 306,488,814The 1918-19-amount includes an actual expenditure of $347,824,274, but it is stated that the adjustment of accounts with Great Britain will probably increase the total to $400,000,000. The Acting Premier (Sir Thomas White) said that at present the Government was in funds, but he added that it may be necessary later on to float a domestic loan. The Minister paid a tribute to Great Britain for the great courage with which she had faced the task of financing the war-, -and said that Canada had much to be grateful for to the Mother Country.Credit in Great Britain. During a debate in the House of Commons on the Governments -proposals regarding the Grand Trunk Pacific, the Acting Prime Minister (Sir Thomas White) referred to a recent despatch to a Canadian newspaper from London hinting that the feeling there was that Canada would be expected to meet the loan in London on $25,000,000 when it became due in June.He regarded that as peculiar in view of the fact that he at that moment was using his efforts as.Minister to renew the loan of $100,000,000 to the Imperial Government
by Canadian, banks. He thought the view expressed could not be that of the Imperial Government, because his relations with it could not have been more satisfactory than they had been. He had, however, cabled to Sir George Per ley as to the truth of the Press despatch, and received the following reply, dated London, March 21th : i &quot; The Chancellor of the Exchequer states that the Treasury^ greatly appreciate the assistance given by Canada in financing the war, as the Dominion was able to loan the British Government more than she borrowed from it. In regard to the loan matiiring in Juiie-, the Treasury will Oh request immediately grant permission for a fresh issue to be placed here to replace it, or will consider favourably the proposal that they pay it off arid set off the same against a portion of their dollar indebtedness to you &quot;if you prefer that course.&quot;This statement was received with applause in the House.New Immigration Bill. -The Dominion Minister of .1 nun ignition and Colonisation (Mr: HA. Calder) has presented the Governments Immigration Bill in the House of Commons. The measure is designed to extend immigration restrictions, and it also extends the time under which undesirables may be deported to five years.Parliament and Deserters. In the House of Commons last week, Sir Sam Hughes presented a motion-, reading :-&quot; In the opinion of this House a uniform system should be adopted in the administration of the law with regard to penalties in relation to defaulters, deserters, slackers, evaders and others amenable to the well-being and good of fire country, and that-such a method is due to soldiers who have voluntarily marched to the front, arid who have fought so well in the great cause of human liberty.&quot;Sir Sam Hughes had no comments to make &quot;on the motion.The Minister Of the interior (Mr. Arthur Meighen), in explaining the attitude of the Government in the matter, said that the motion called for the uniform administra-tion of the law, but this was vested in the Provinces and not in the Dominion. The resolution was too wide to commend itself to Parliament. It couicl not . be affirmed with any hope of success that each Province should provide penalties alike.The Leader of tke Opposition (Mr. D. D. MaeKenzie) thought that defaulters should be relieved of uncertainty. He stated that he had no sympathy with slackers, but he thought that the Government should not be vindictive.The Minister of Militia (General Mew-burn.) remarked that there had been few deserters shot at the front, but there had been none since he had entered the Ministry. He favoured the disfranchisement of all defaulters for a period of years.Mr. Martin Burred pointed out that defaulters were offered a -general amnesty last August, and he supported the proposal for their disfranchisement.Mr. Lucien Cannon, the French-Canadian member for Dorchester, suggested that some Ministers promised farmers that they would not be liable to conscription, and he added that when defaulters were brought to court, these Ministers should stand beside them.Mr. W. F. Coekshirtt (Brantford) said that if Quebec had furnished her fair share under the voluntary system it Would never have been necessary to establish conscription.The motion was still under debate when the Houseudijournecl, and the probabilities are that under the Parliamentary procedure the subject will be taken, up on die next private members&apos; day.Industrial Commission. -The composition of the Royal Commission constituted at the request of the Minister of Labour to investigate the industrial relations in the country, arid to subriiit a report to Parliament on the subject as to how the conditions may be improved, is announced -as follows : -Chairman, Chief Justice Mathers, of Manitoba ; Senator Smeaton White, Messrs. C-has. Harrison., Labour M.P. for Nipissing ; Carl Riorda-n, of Montreal ; F. Pauze, of Montreal; Toni Moore, of Ottawa, President of the Trades and Labour Council; and J. W. Bruce, of Toronto, member of the Labour Appeal Board.The first two will act as representatives of the public, while the second two represent the employers, and the last-named two will look after the interests of the employees.Quebec arid Prohibition. -The Province of Quebec has voted on the referendum as to whether the sale of beer and light wines shall be permitted or not. At a late hour the vote gave a large majority in favour of the sale. - The cities all voted &quot; wet,&quot;
including Montreal, Quebec, Sherbrooke, Hull and St. Hyacinth e. The figures will not be available for some days, owing to the extent of the territory and the poor communication at this season oh the year. ^      -Ontario and Prohibition. Sir William Hearst has announced in the Ontario Legislature that the promises of the Ontario Government relative to its temperance policy would be carried out soon by the presentation of Bills. The electorate will be offered a referendum, probably in the coming fall, when four questions will-be submitted to them as follows :  .(1) Are you in favour of repealing the Ontario Temperance Act ? (2) Are you in favour of the sale of light beer, containing not more than 2 &quot;51 per cent, in alcoholic weight ; sale through Government agencies; and amendments to the; Ontario Temperance Act to permit such sales ? (3) Are you in favour of the sale of light beer in standard hotels in local municipalities that by a majority vote favour such sale ? (4) Are you in favour of the sale of spirituous and malt liquors through Government agencies ?No provision is made for the sale of wines.-   N - v, &apos;Dominion Goat of Arms. Consideration is being given by the Government to a new Dominion coat of arms.The subject has been referred to a committee, consisting of Mr. Thomas Mulvey, K.C. (Under Secretary of State), Sir Joseph Pope (Under Secretary for External Affairs), Major-General Gwatkin (Chief of the General Staff), and Dr. A. G. Doughty (the Dominion Archivist).The present coat of arms is representative of the Provinces of Quebec, Ontario, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia, and was adopted.in 1868, before the other Provinces had entered the Confederation. When a design emblematic of the nine Provinces of the Dominion has been selected it will be submitted to the Heralds&apos; College and registered.NEWFOUNDLAND.General Election. In the House of Assembly on April 10th, the Premier announced that, owing to the doubt whether sufficient time had been allowed for the General Election, the subsequent meeting of the new Parliament, and the enactment of various financial measures, the Government had decided to abandon the idea of an election next month, and to extend the life of Parliament until the autumn.The election will accordingly be held in November..   AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH.London Shipping Conference and Commonwealth Trade. -The Acting Minister for the Navy (Mr. Poynton), commenting on the contention of the London Shipping Conference that the agreement between English shipping companies is not a combine unfairly to exploit Australian trade, said he was unaware that such combines were established for the benefit of the public or that the refusal of rebates was in the interests of producers. He asked what right had the London Shij)ping Conference or any other body to claim the control of the high seas. Such statements would not deter him from doing the proper thing in the interests of the people of Australia. He would be very sorry to see a state of affairs arrive which would leave producers to the tender mercies of the combine, even if run on philanthropic lines, attributed to the London Shipping Conference. - .Government Steamship. The second steel steamship constructed under the Commonwealth Government scheme was launched at Williamstown in the presence of the Governor-General, the Governor of Victoria, the Acting Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition, and a gathering of leading citizens. Lady Munro Ferguson christened the vessel Dromana.The Acting Minister for the Navy (Mr. Pojmton) said he hoped three more vessels would be launched in a few months with the steel and engines made in Australia,Supply of War Material. The Manager of the Commonwealth Arsenal (Mr. Leightoii), who has returned to Australia, states that observations abroad satisfied him
that Australia was niagnificentby placed,.as regards raw materials for war purposes. Should the Government decide to make. Australia, self-contained, Australia could supply all defence requirements from the rifle to the biggest field,gun.New South Wales Labour and Legislative Council. The New South Wales Labour Party is renewing its. agitation for the abolition of the Legislative Council.Labour and Peace Celebrations.--The Labour Council in Sydney has decided not to participate in the peace celebrations, expressing the opinion that it wotdd be better to spend the money on building soldiers&apos; homes. The Council is starting an agitation for a shorter working day.Trade Unions and &quot; One Big Union.&quot;- After a two days&apos; conference the supporters of the &quot; One Big Union&quot; scheme have failed to secure support from a substantial section of the Trade Unions.Bolsheviks in Brisbane. The military authorities are prosecuting, with a view to deportation, 10 leaders of the demonstration held in Brisbane on March 23rd by a large crowd, chiefly composed of Russians. Acting on instructions from the Re turned Soldiers&apos; League, the returned soldiers have now desisted from associating themselves with the anti-Russian demonstrations.Returned soldiers broke up a Socialist meeting at Richmond (Q.), at which Bolshevism was preached. A. Socialist editor has been sentenced to six months&apos; imprisonment for publishing a blasphemous article on&apos; Bolshevism.NEW ZEALAND.Referendum on Prohibition. The latest figures yet announced in the referendum upon prohibition are as follows: Civilians, for continuance of licensing, 226,397; for prohibition, 238,745. Soldiers, for continuance, 15,875 ; for prohibition, 3,955. There is thus a continuance majority of 428, with 25,000 soldiers&apos; votes still to be returned.Control of Samoa. Dealing with the question of New Zealand acting as the mandatory Power for Samoa, the Nero Zealand Times considers that the Dominion cannot afford the expenditure required for development, and also that its achninis-trafion of the Cook Islands proves its incapacity for the task, whereas the Imperial Service has the traditions and men suitable for the government of such dependencies. New Zealand, the journal states, wants neither annexation nor additional burdens for her people or duties for her statesmen.SOUTH AFRICA.Strike Settlement.-Prior to the settlement of the Johannesburg strike (vide Report No. 114), the strikers presented a long list of demands to the Majority Section of the Municipal Council. The latter framed replies conceding practically all the points, chief among which were : (1) No retrenchment except.by the Heads of Departments in consultation withthe Advisory Committees. (2) The Strikers&apos; Board of Control shall cease to exist.(3) The appointment of Advisory Committees of the men to co-operate with the management on questions of wages and conditions of labour.(4) The appointment of a Provisional Committee of Enquiry to investigate into local government.(5) The removal of anomalies in the case of municipal employees.(6) A 48 hours maximum week 4or all municipal employees.(7) Payment of employees during the strike.(8) An indemnity clause for all contracts or payments, &amp;c, during the strike.A subsequent meeting of the Town Council conformed the terms of settlement. The Chairmen of the Finance, Health and Public Works Committees and four other Council!qrs resigned. The Acting Prime Minister (Mr. Malan) made a statement in Parliament confirming the settlement between the strikers and the Municipal Council.7786-3aB
INDIA.Riots. The Viceroy reported to the India Office by telegrams dated April 11th and 13th that grave disorders had occurred in various parts of India. It was anticipated that some outbreak would result about April 6th, which had been set apart as a clay of &quot;humiliation and prayer&quot; in.protest against the Rowlatt Bills by the extremist society knowu as the Satyagraha Sabha (see below). Little disturbance,, however, occurred on that day, which, the Viceroy&apos;s reports show, passed quietly in most places, though there were many meetings - and demonstrations. It was not till the 10th or 11th that the news of serious rioting, accompanied by loss of life, was received.The trouble occurred principally in the Punjab, particularly at Amritsar, the sacred city of the Sikhs, and in Bombay Presidency at Ahmedabad, the second city of the Presidencj^. The mobs burned banks, Government buildings, and railway premises. They also cut telegraph wires, and at Amritsar they burned to death three bank managers.Troops -were called in to restore order, and there were casualties on both sides. In the Punjab five Europeans were killed and nine rioters, while 21 were wounded.. At Kasur one British soldier was killed and one wounded, and from Ahmedabad &quot; slight loss oC life &quot; is reported.The latest information is to the effect that order has been restored in the areas of disturbance.Day of Humiliation and Prayer. In an earlier communication the Government of India reported that a manifesto ordaining that Sunday, April 6th, should be observed as a day of humiliation and prayer had been issued in Bombay by a society known as the Satyagraha Sabha.The manifesto- stated that owing to the Delhi tragedy demonstrators had been enjoined that there should be no talking and no noise, and that absolute silence-should prevail. No yjressure Qf any kind whatsoever should be put on these who do not fast or suspend work, and those not participating in the national mourning should be left absolutely undisturbed. Persons taking part in the demonstration were asked to obey aU police instructions.Delhi Riots. The Government of India have telegraphed to the Secretary of State the text of a communique issued by them in India with the object of contradicting certain misrepresentations which have been spread. The communique is as follows :  There is reason to believe that misleading-accounts of the effects of the Anarchical and Revolutionary Grimes Act, commonly known as the Rowlatt Bills, are being-circulated among the more ignorant sections of the poprdation.Thus in Delhi it is reported that large sections of the populace believe that the Act empowers any police officer to arrest without warrant any three Indians seen engaged in conversation and to enter and search without warrant any house. These beliefs, sedulously propagated by evilly disposed persons, and allowed to pass un contra dieted by others, doubtless account largely for the high state of excitement prevalent among the crowds that came in conflict with the police and military at Delhi on March 30th with fatal results.It is hardly necessary to state that the Act contains no provisions of the nature indicated. It confers no powers of arbitrary arrest or search on the police, and the only reference which it contains to arrest or search is in section 31 (1), which authorises the arrest on the written order of a local government of any person where reasonable grounds exist for believing that he has been, or is, concerned in -certain serious offences in any area to which Part 3 of the Act has been extended. The same section permits the search under similar authority of any place in such area believed to have been used by such person for any purpose connected with .an anarchical or revolutionary movement-No part of the Act is yet in force, nor can any part be brought into force in any province or area unless and until the Governor-General of India in Council is satisfied that an anarchical or revolutionary movement is being promoted in such province or area.Famine. The Government of India in a telegram to the India Office dated April. 11th stated that famine had been declared in Baghelkhand Agency, Central India.-
Distress was announced as subsiding in Saugor and relief measures and harvest operations were easing the situation in Jubbulpore.   The numbers relieved were as ^SVS :,-5enSal; ^nitons relief, 5,885 ; District Board work, 4,369 ; test works 1.58J.   Bihar and Orissa : gratuitous relief, 8,831 ; test works. 8 482 - United Pro vinces: gratuitous relief, 12,428; test works, 12,327.   Raj p u tana : Velie   works&quot; 728; test works, o 039; gratuitous relief, 253.   Ajmer Merwara:  test works  24^ gratuitous relief, 324.   Central India: relief works, 11,445; gratuitous relief, 6,055 Central Provinces; works 33 204 ; gratuitous relief, 27,793.. Bombay : relief works&apos; 59,021 ; gratuitous relief, 68,299; village works, 1,867; test works 2 9*4 *MaS&apos; works. 3,098; gratuitous relief, 22,753. &apos;   &apos; Madras.OTHER COLONIES, PROTECTORATES, &amp;c.EGYPT.Development of the Situation.  General Allenby reported in a telegram dated April 7 th that the announcement that restrictions on travel would be removed had been received with enthusiasm. Among other permits, he had given permission for all the members of the original Extremist Committee to leave Egypt for England, instructions being given for the release of Saad Pasha Zaghlul and the three other agitators interned at Malta. They are now on their way to England as private individuals accorded no political recognition by His Majesty&apos;s Government.On April 9th General Allenby telegraphed that he had formed a new Ministry composed as follows : Prime Minister - -                 - Sir Hussein Rushdy Pasha, G.CM.G.Minister of Finance -             - Yusef Wahba Pasha.Interior -                - Sir Adly Yeghen Pasha, KO.M.G.,,       Justice -            - Abdel Khalek Sarwat Pasha.,,        Wakfs -                - Gaafar Waly Pasha.,,        Agriculture -             - Ahmed Midhat Yeghen Pasha.,,        Public Works and War     - Hassan Hassib Pasha.The first four of these were members of the late Cabinet Gaafer Waly Pasha has been Under Secretary of State for the Interior, Ahmed Miclhat Yeghen Pasha was Governor of Alexandria, and Hassan Hassib Pasha was Monelir of Gharbia Province, the capital of which is Tanta.Bushdy Pasha will take the Ministry of Education for the present.On April 10th General Allenby reported that the new Ministry had been well received, and that they were doing all that they could to induce Government officials who had struck work to return to their posts. The staff of the State Railways had-for the most part resumed work.He stated that the provinces were quiet, but that peasant demonstrations had occurred in some districts. In Cairo hostilitj- was still shown to Armenians and, to some extent, Greeks.On the 11th the general state of public feeling in Cairo was said to be somewhat calmer: attacks on Armenians had practically ceased. A collision between roughs and troops occurred in Alexandria resulting in some casualties anrongst the natives, but a deputation of lawyers had waited on the General Officer Commanding, Alexandria, to express their regret at the incident and their appreciation of the manner in which the British troops had behaved under great provocation.The provinces continued quiet, with some local attacks in outlying districts on telephone lines.On the 12th the Ministers had still been unable to reach a settlement with the Government officials who were on strike. The new Ministry had issued a public notice deprecating violence and insubordination, and calling upon strikers to return to work.On the 13th an insurrection broke out in Tura prison, situated some 10 miles south of Cairo. A number of convicts broke out; some were shot by the Sudanese guard, others escaped and are still at large.
On the 13th General Allenhy telegraphed that the Ministers had not succeeded in bringing about a cessation of- the strike. They were alarmed by the growing Bolshevism of the movement.The Armenian colonj7 had been placed in a concentration camp under British protection. The origin of the anti-Armenian movement proved to be due to a disreputable body of Young Turk-sympathisers, possibly in collusion with students.Telegraphing on the 14th, General Allenby said that the strike was still in full force, and that, although there was an undercurrent of resistance to the strike on the part of the Moderates, the Extremists were as powerful as ever.The provinces remained quiet, but a strike of Government officials had. occurred at Zagazig.FOREIGN COLONIES, &amp;e. IN AFRICA.GERMAN COLONIES.-Herr Erzberger and Mandatory System. Dealing with President Wiison&apos;s draft relating to the League of Nations, Herr Erzberger in a recent speech said that the colonial question in Article 19 was notoriously framed to exclude Germany. Handing over South-West Africa and the South Sea Islands to the Mandatory Nations was J merely a veil covering a policy of annexation. But Germany had an indisputable moral right to colonial possessions. Moreover, he claimed that Germans were successful colonisers. It would be an insult to the entire nation were its colonies taken away and placed under the guardianship of another nation, as if Germany were incapable of the task. If the colonial claims were to be freely and unconditionally adjusted according to Wilson&apos;s fifth point, this nation ought to be admitted to the discussion. They would wait and see if this was done. If it was not, they would anxiousby see by what process of reasoning the Allies would bring their deliberations into line with Wilson&apos;s fifth point.Public Interest in Colonies. The Preussische Zeitung says that the National Assembly at Weimar is being snowed under by petitions for the retention of the German colonies. It is stated that there is a daily increase in the number of protests from all parts of the Empire against the proposal of the Allies to retain the German colonies. So far as can be ascertained at the moment, there have been mass meetings in over a hundred of the principal towns at which resolutions have been passed urging the Government to sign no peace that removes Germany from the list of colonial Powers. Over three million Germans have signed a petition based on - President Wilson&apos;s fifth point as to the impartial consideration of all colonial questions.Dr. Bell, Minister of Colonies, in an interview at Weimar, said that people should not be pessimistic about the colonies. They were only lost if the German people acquiesced in their loss.A meeting of members of the Assembly and citizens at Weimar on Thursday demanded the restoration of Germany&apos;s colonies, without which no peace could be just.
