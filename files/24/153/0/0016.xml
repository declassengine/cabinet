SECRET.APPRECIATION -OK THE ATTACHED REPORT No. 110.BRITISH  EMPIRE  AND AFRICA.. Canada.The criticisms of the Government in Parliament do not seem to have amounted to anything substantial. There appears to be an increasing determination to maintain the stability of the combination between the Conservatives and Liberal-Unionists. /    .   , .. -    .,   ..,The speech delivered by a well-known Freuc.h-Canadian;Senatorupon the necessity of an Imperial Parliament can-&quot;hardly be said to represent the present attitude of the majority of either French or English speaking Canadian politicians. . Fear oLinter-ference with local autonomy is the dominant feature in the Canadian attitude towards this important subject, but thoughtful politicians are beginning torealise that the future may demand that a Cabinet of Governments should have collective responsibility to a single representative body.The remarkable increase of the trade of the Dominion with Japan should be noted.It is satisfactory to observe that the Acting Prime Minister has made a clear statement upon the British treatment of Canadian trade.Australian Commonwealth.Apparently the decision of the Trade Union delegates to form a single Industrial Workers&apos; Union for Australia has not received the sanction of the Trades and Labour Council.   (Vide also Report No. 105.)An interesting comparison of the condition of Australian workers as compared with the workers of France has been made by the French Labour representatives, who have just terminated their visit to the Commonwealth.The financial success of the Government cargo steamers augurs well for future enterprise in this direction.South Africa.The debate on Republicanism in the House of Assembly terminated some days ago. It is fortunate that the Government amendment was accepted by both the Opposition and the Labour Party and that a clear-cut decision was thus obtained upon the necessity of the maintenance of the Union and the British connection. A remarkable fact emphasised by Sir Thomas Smartt is that General Hertzog is the only leader of the present agitation who is an ex-Republican. [p.t.o.
The Nationalist deputation will. apparently find its way to Europe ahout the middle of April. The additional members of the delegation, whose names are given in this Report, are both strong Republicans. With regard to Dr. Reitz (son of the President of the Senate) it is interesting to remember that the brother of this delegate is a strong supporter of the British connection, and as a Colonel in the British Army has been wounded in France.The report of the ministerial inspection of H.M.S. Minerva has served to clear up the position regarding the Nationalist refusal to travel in the warship.The East London by-election involves a Labour gain.India.The Financial Statement for 1919-20 deserves careful attention, more especially the Observations of the Finance Member as to the Outlook for the future. ......

BRITISH  EMPIRE   AND   AFRICA  REPORT.SELF-GOVERNING   DOMINIONS.CANADA. &quot;Proceedings in Parliament: Position of Liberal-Unionists: Criticism of Govern-ment. -One of the speeches in Parliament that attracted attention last -week was that delivered by Dr. Michael Clark, the Liberal-Unionist Member for Red Deer (Alberta), who previously represented that constituency in the Liberal interest. In the course of his observations Dr. Clark, said : &quot; Now that we have reached the end of the war, I -want to claim for the Union Government the place which I believe history will give it in an increasing degree, and to claim for the Government which preceded the Union Government that they knew from the beginning and until the end what the objective was. The Union Government knew the difficulties and did not shrink by one hair&apos;s breadth from the sacrifices that were necessary to reach that objective.&quot; Dr, Clark proceeded to ridicule the offer of the Opposition to the Liberal-Unionists to return to the Liberal fold, and he stated that when he left the ranks of the Opposition he did so for his country&apos;s good, and when another alignment was made it would be for the same reason, declaring: &quot;We joined these others, and if we can stay we shall do so. If we cannot stay we shall leave, but whenever this is necessary it will only be for the good of our country.&quot;Air. Ernest Tremblay (0., Kamouraska), who followed Dr. Clark, criticised the absence of the Prime Minister, saying that Canada was his place at the present time. On the point of the absence of Dominion Ministers at the Peace Conference, Mr. A. K. McLean (Minister without portfolio) replied for the Government and pointed out that this was the judgment clay of the nations and their institutions, and that the Conference now sitting was the greatest ever held in human history. If would be strange, he said, if Canadians were not allowed to participate. If Canada was not represented thei-e, why should the United States be ? Canada&apos;s war effort was as great as that of the country to the south of her, and she had fought as a nation. In a previous debate, Dr. Edwards (U., Frontenac) found complete justification for the presence of Sir Robert Borden and the other Ministers at the Peace Conference. He said the war had shown that Canada was vitally interested in European matters. He thought they should be proud to have a Prime Minister whose advice was considered of value by other great nations.In the course of the debate earlier in the week Sir Sam Hughes (ex-Minister of Militia) condemned the War Measures Act and urged the return to the old Parlia-mentary form of government, including the resumption of patronage by the dominant party. He stated that he was an Independent in politics and anxious to see the establishment of democratic government.Press and Liberal-Unionists. An interesting reference was made in the Toronto Globe last week to the probable permanency of the alliance between the Conservatives and Liberal-Unionists as follows : &quot; From out of the throes of caucus after caucus, conference upon conference, is emerging more and more a well-defined determination to supersede the present union of Liberals and Conservatives, effected under the pressure of a great national crisis, by a permanent Unionist Party.&quot;Need of an Imperial Parliament: a French-Canadian View. A remarkable speech was delivered last week in the Dominion Senate upon the necessity of an Imperial Parliament by Senator J. P. B. Casgrain, who is one of the Liberal represen-tatives of Montreal and a member of one of the oldest French families in Canada. Senator Casgrain declared that Canada was not a nation, and had never declared her independence; she was a Colony of the British Empire, and they should stop deceiving themselves.   It was true that they had a certain amount of autonomy, but
It was limited-&quot;by.-British goodwill.; He continued : &quot;We are uot British citizens, we are British subjects, and the Prime Minister of the Dominion, the Leader of the Opposition, and the whole House of Commons have no more influence over the decisions of the Imperial Parliament than the wildest Indian of the North-West, the dirtiest Eskimo of the Arctic Circle, or the darkest Kaffir of South Africa. A British citizen is a man who pays taxes, is on the lists and votes. One British citizen has more power than all our politicians put together. In a close election he can elect a Member of Parliament who may decide for peace or war for the whole Empire, Canada included, and we have no say in the matter. I think it is time that we had.&quot; In reply to questions, Mr. Casgrain said his dream was an Imperial Parliament in London where all the people of the British Empire would be represented, and in which the populations of Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa would entitle the Dominions to one-third of the representation. Mr. Casgrain added that he Avas surprised to find how many Members of Parliament and the Senate were ready to unite and to foster these ideas.Increase of Trade until Japan. The Canadian Trade Commissioner at Yokokama has issued a report which states that before the outbreak of the war Canada was very little known to tke average Japanese, but he observes that from the time Canada sent her first contingent to France in 1914 Japan has been giving more attention to the Dominion. The Trade Commissioner continues : &quot; When Japan heard of our production of munitions and ships, she began to inquire into our resources, and was surprised to find that we were a manufacturing country, and. there were many things we made which she was importing from other countries. As a result, many Government officials and business men journey7ed to Canada to learn more about us. They wanted to find out what they could buy from Canada and also what things the.y could sell to us. These men have come home imbued with the great possibilities that Canada has to offer as a market for Japanese goods. They also found out that there were many things which Japan could import from Canada to advantage. As a result, the trade between Canada and   Japan has increased greatly, in spite of the many barriers which were in force as a result of the war.&quot; After giving the figures relating to trade between the two countries, the Commissioner sums up the position as follows: &quot;During the first 10 months of 1918, Canada increased her exports to Japan by over 146 per cent., while Japan increased her exports to Canada by some 70 per cent.&quot; .   .Dominion Representative for Commercial Intelligence. An Order-in-Council passed on January 30th provided for the appointment of the Chairman, of the Canadian Trade Mission in London (Mr. Lloyd Harris) as a member of the Advisory Committee on Commercial Intelligence (British) on the recommendation of the Acting-Secretary of State for External Affairs. This action was taken as the resxdt of a despatch from the Secretary of State for the Colonies of August 26th, 1918, respecting the appointment of an Advisory Council to assist the Department of Commerce and Industry.British Treatment of Canadian and United States Trade. The question of the alleged discrimination by Great Britain against Canadian trade in favour of the United States was discussed in Parliament last week when the Acting Prime Minister (Sir Thomas White) stated : &quot;I have had a good deal to do with the finance and trade of Great Britain with respect to this country since the outbreak of the war. I have known the great difficulties under which she has Itiboured and the trying situations with which she has been confronted from, time to time, and I desire to say that I believe that to the utmost of-her power she has endeavoured to assist Canada in her trade, and her intentions to us have been of the most friendly and generous character.&quot; &apos;Daylight Saving. The United States Congress having failed to repeal the Daylight Saving Act, the measure will again be in force there from the end of March to the beginning of October. It is stated that Canada must necessarily follow the lead of the United States owing to the inconvenience which wrould arise from having two sets of time on the Continent. Manyt public bodies in Canada have expressed opinion in favour of, or contrary to, the scheme, but it is understood that it will, again be adopted in the Dominion.
The Manitoba Legislature, with one dissenting voice,.placed themselves on record as against the re-adoption of the measure.Numbers released from Army.-Senator Gideon Robertsou, speaking at a meeting under the auspices of the Army and Navy Veterans&apos; Association, discussed post-war problems, and expressed his confidence that they would be mastered before many months were passed.The Minister stated at the outset that 300,000 men and 50,000 dependants had to be brought back to Canada, and the plans which had already been made were being carried out smoothly. Over 100,000 soldiers had been discharged since hostilities ceased.AUSTRALIA N COMMONWEALTH.Industrial Workers&apos;. Union.-It is announced that the Australian Trades and Labour Council have rejected the scheme for the formation of one large Union, to be termed the Industrial Workers&apos; Union of Australia, by 28 votes to 27 (vide Report No. 105).Returned Soldiers: Provision of Work and Land. The Commonwealth Government, through the Repatriation Department, have given 500,000?. to 1,071 local government bodies for the purpose &quot;of starting public works to afford returned soldiers immediate temporary employment, pending the completion of a larger loan scheme to provide work on more permanent lines. The proposal embraces only men who are not absorbed promptly in the ordinary activities of the community. The local bodies will deal direct with applicants. No portion of the grant is available for the regular employees of the local government authorities, nor for administrative expenses.The monthly return of the Victorian Closer Settlement Board shows that ptirchases of land on behalf of returned soldiers aggregate 77,189 acres at a cost of 1,007,519Z. The Queensland Settlement Committee reports that 591 soldiers have selected land comprising 210,961 acres, and that 416,415 acres are available; 415 soldiers and widows have been provided with homes; 441 applicants have received assistance to develop their holdings ; the State Government has advanced 299,732L for settlement purposes.Australian Workers : Comparison with French. The Labour members, Messrs. Thomsen and Hodie, on a mission to Australia from France, have left Australia for France. M. Thomsen, in the course of an interview, said that his impression was that Australian workers enjoyed better conditions than the workers of Europe. The eight-hour day was a great advance, and wages were relatively higher in Australia than in Europe, excepting for highly skilled labour, which was better paid in France than in the Commonwealth. The Australian worker was better housed and dressed than the French, due to taxation not falling heavily on the working class, but was not so well off as the French regarding food, owing to French women&apos;s good qualities in housekeeping. Australia possessed the necessa^ legislative powers to effect the transformations in social conditions the majority desired. The future depended on reciprocal good feeling between employers and employees.Government Steamers : Financial Success. The Canadian Trade Commissioner in Australia has reported upon the Australian Governments enterprise in the owner-ship of cargo steamers. The following passage occurs in this report : &quot; In June 1916 the Commonwealth Government purchased 16 cargo steamers at a cost of approximately 2,080,000?&quot;. The first years operations of this fleet showed surplus earnings of 986,3821. A cable was recently received from the general manager in London that the original cost of the steamers has been paid and that over 16,000?. remained to the credit of the vessels. Two of the steamers have been torpedoed. The Commonwealth Government have also controlled the operations of a large fleet of enemy steamers interned in Australian ports at the outbreak of the war, two of which have been torpedoed. While the ruling rates of freight have been demanded by the Commonwealth line of steamers on goods shipped at oversea ports, it is emphasised that they carried exports of Australian wheat and products at considerably less than war freight rates.J
SOUTH AFRICA.Republicanism : Debate in the House of Assembly. Trie anti-Republican debate was continued in the House of. Assembly on March 1st, when the Leader of the Opposition (Sir Thomas Smartt) replied on the debate. He again emphasised that, when the English-speaking people entered the Union, they accepted the promises of the Dutch-speaking population wholeheartedly, but those promises had been broken by the Nationalists. The Union, he said, was a solemn compact between the two white races ; it had been ratified by four Colonial Parliaments and further- ratified by the British Houses of Parliament and the King. That was a compact which could not be broken even by a vote of that House. Sir Thomas Smartt commented on the extraordinary fact that apart from General Hertzog, not one of the leaders of the present agitation was an ex-Republican. He believed the debate would do a lot of good, because there was no hope for South Africa if racial animosity continued. Sir Thomas Smartt accepted the speeches delivered by ex-Republicans and others on the ministerialist side of the House in all sincerity and without a scintilla of suspicion, and announced his readiness to accept the Acting PremiePs amendment which was the&quot; same as his motion in substance, but he did not accept the amend-ment submitted by Colonel Ores well, the Labour Leader, on February 12th, as it was necessary to have a clear-cut issue. Sir Thomas, proceeding, deprecated Dr. Colin SteyiPs reference to Dutch dominance, and emphatically&apos;declared that anybody who tried to establish racial dominance in South Africa after all they had gone through was a curse to the country. Continuing, Sir Thomas Smartt said that the whole future of the Union of South Africa depended on the unity of the two white races, and under no circumstances would they allow the Union to be broken up. They would maintain the British connection at all costs.When Sir Thomas Smartt had finished, the Leader of the Labour Party (Colonel Greswell), while adhering to the sentiments of his amendment, withdrew it because he realised the country wanted a decision on the clear-cut issue of the British connection. The Leader of the Opposition having also withdrawn his motion in favour of the amendment submitted by the Acting Premier (vide Report No. 107), the latter was then adopted by 78 votes against 24, the minority consisting wholly of Nationalists. The result of the division was received with loud cheers and counter-cheers.Departure of Nationalist Deputation. The Governor-General informed the Secretary of State by telegram, dated March 6th, that the Nationalist Delegation having declined the offer of passages on. H.M.S. Minerva, sailed on March 4th for New York by the Dutch Steamship Bewean of Sfcoomvaart Maatschappij, Nederland. This vessel is returning to South Africa from the United States and therefore it will be necessary for the delegates to arrange for their journey from New York, where they expect to arrive on April 1st, to Europe. In addition to those already mentioned (vide Report No. 105) the delegation includes Dr. PI. Reitz (a son of the President of the Senate) and Dr. Gey Van Pittius (Secretary).Nationalists and HALS. &quot; Minerva.&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos; The reversal by the Nationalists of their decision to accept the Admiralty&apos;s offer to transport the Nationalist delegation to Europe on board the Minerva has attracted much attention in South Africa. It is generally accepted that the reasons for the change were the result-of pressure from the Backveld. In the course of the statement as to the circumstances issued by the delegation, it is declared that, as a result of a visit to the Minerva, at the instance of the Admiralty, to inspect the accommodation, it became clear that the Admiralty considered it practically impossible for the deputation to sail with the ship and, in any case, deemed it positively inadvisable. The Nationalists maintain that the offer shows that the Republican movement is regarded by the authorities as constitu-tional.In the course of the anti-Republican debate in the House of Assembly on February 26th, General W, M. My burgh (South African Party) ridiculed the official statement issued by the Nationalist organ describing the visit of the delegates to the Minerva.. This statement mentioned, inter alia, that the Minerva had no bathroom and no refrigerator, that those on board would have to exist on canned foods after the first few days at sea, while the deputation would also be required to bring their own
-cook and servants, who, however, could not be properly accommodated. The state&quot; ment declared that everything was painted as black as possible in order to discourage the deputation. General Myburgh stated that he and two other Ministerialists had visited the Minerva after the Nationalists and had noticed the presence of footbaths in every cabin, besides the daily sailbath. General Myburgh ridiculed these leaders of the people, some of whom had fought for years in the field for independence and were hesitating from undertaking the present mission because they had no bath. Admiral Hill had told him (General Myburgh) that he had spoken to the delegates as man to man, and not in his official capacity, so that the delegates should know the exact position as regards accommodation, and not afterwards say they did not know on what they were embarking. Tkeir host had offered his hospitality like a gentleman, and General Myburgh -denied as the basest and meanest insinuation the Nationalist assertion that the Captain of the Minerva and Admiral Hill had done their best to dissuade the deputation from going on the Minerva.The. report of the Ministerial deputation of inspection to H.M.S. Minerva, to which General Myburgh referred in the above extract, has been published.. It states that the Captain of the warship in order to safeguard himself against possible complaints after the journey, frankly emphasised that the Nationalist delegates must not expect all the conveniences of a first-class passenger steamer. Admiral Hill also spoke to the delegates and never for a moment had in mind any objection to taking the delegation. The Captain further stated that when the delegates left after inspecting the ship, his relations with them were most cordial, and he certainly was given the impression that they would sail in the ship as they stated they were looking forward to a pleasant voyage with him. The Captain was so convinced of this that he immediately requisitioned material to perform the necessary alterations on the ship, and the Ministerialists found that these operations had actually been begun. The report then describes the accommodation and adds that the Nationalist delegates would have received exactly the same treatment as the ship&apos;s officers. - It concludes by stating emphatically that after hearing all the evidence, and after thoroughly inspecting the accommodation the Ministerialist deputation would never for a moment have hesitated to accept a passage on the ship in the circumstances. The report is signed by General Myburgh, Commandant Collins and Colonel Hamman.-Admiral FitzIIerbert also sent a memorandum to the Governor-General detailing the circumstances of the offer. In this memorandum, which has also been published, the Admiral states that on the morning of February 17th he offered verbally to General Hertzog a passage for the delegates in the Minerva, provided suitable accommodation could be found for so large a party without disturbing the officers from the cabins to which they were entitled. Admiral FitzHerbert explained that the - accommodation could not be good, and condition that General Hertzog or his representative, before accepting the offer, should visit the ship. General Hertzog thanked him cordially for the offer and accepted the conditions. Messrs. Beyers and Van Pittius interviewed Admiral FitzHerberts Secretary on February 19th and were informed that the voyage Avould take about a month, but the route depended on the Admiralty. The delegates would not pay for their passage but food would cost 9s. daily. The Secretary also showed them H.M.S. Hyacinth, which is approximately the same size as the Minerva. The Minerva arrived at Simonstown at 7 in the evening on February 19th. At 8.30 the same evening the deputation-telephoned accepting the offer and stating that a confirmatory letter had been posted. As this acceptance did not comply with the stated condition, Admiral FitzHerbert telephoned saying he considered that the accommodation should first be inspected. The delegates agreed to this and carried out the inspection in the forenoon of February .20th, in the presence of Rear-Admiral Hill and Captain Raikes, the representative of Admiral FitzHerbert, who requested that the delegates should call on him at Admiralty House before returning to Cape Town. Admiral FitzHerbert awaited them there, bat was informed by Admiral Hill that the delegates wishing to catch their train had no time to see him. Notice of the refusal of the offer was received at 11.30 in the morning of February 21st, and was subsequently confirmed by letter.Referring to the delegates&apos; report on the inspection of the Minerva, Admiral FitzHerbert states that he referred the translation of the report to Captain Raikes and Admiral Hill from which he gathered that several statements in the report were incorrect while others were grounded on facts which had been much distorted. Captain Raikes stated that his attitude was to put the delegation iu possession of facts&apos; and to avoid influencing them in any way.   He did not wish to give any
impression that they were not welcome. Admiral Hill remarked that several state-ments he had never made were attributed to him. Admiral FitzHerbert adds that Captain Raikes was evidently anxious for the delegates to know the worst in order to obviate as far as possible any subsequent complaints. Rear-Admiral Hill gave his friendly advice as a private individual that the delegates would be more comfortable with moderate accommodation&apos;on a mail steamer. &quot;I need hardly add,&quot; remarks Admiral FitzHerbert, &quot; that my offer to General Hertzog AAras a genuine one, and that the idea of discouraging&apos; its acceptance never entered my head. When I heard the delegates had declined my offer my assumption was that they did so because the accommodation was inadequate, not because: they considered their presence on board not to be desired.&quot;By-election, The result of the by-election in East London for the seat in the House of Assembly rendered vacant by the resignation of Brigadier-General Sir C. P. Ore we (Unionist), is as follows :-&quot;Mr. Stewart (Labour), 1,221 votes. Mr. Lewnds (Unionist), 1,203 votes.Aerial Route from Cape to Cairo. Major Court Treatt, the officer in charge of the Southern Survey of the aerial route from Cairo to Cape Town, stated on February 28th, in the course of an inteiwiew with ReuteFs representative, that aU the sites for aerodromes from Abercorn southwards Avere being surveyed preparatory to the erection of the aerodromes. In the meantime, supplies of petrol, oil, distilled water and other necessaries had been got together at Pretoria for distribution. The distance betAveen the sites is from 300 to 400 miles. With a large Handley-Page machine the 5,300 miles from Cairo to Cape Town should be accomplished, Major Treatt says, in about 50 flying hours. The survey of the region from Victoria Nyanza to Abercorn has been entrusted to Major Emmett, a South African officer who landed at Mombasa about the middle of January.INDIA.Financial Statement, 1919-20.The Financial Statement of the Government of India was presented in the Viceroy&apos;s Legislative Council by the Finance Member (Sir J. S. Mestorj) on March 1st. The chief features of his speech were as follows : General Characteristics of 1918-19.  Reviewing the closing year, the Finance Member observed that all other features of the year Avere dominated by the cessation of hostilities in November. The first seven months were a period of great and widespread activity largely connected with InchVs Avar efforts, reflected alike in Government revenues and trade prosperity. The later months ay ere marked by a sharp reaction due to the collapse of speculation and accompanied by unfavourable agricultural conditions and the influenza epidemic. To the painful process of descending to the more normal plane of trade and business the chief obstacle at present is the persistently high range of prices. After discussing agricultural and trade conditions, removal of restrictions on trade, and India&apos;s Avar effort, the Finance Member at length referred to the course of currency and exchange during the year, particularly to the silver crisis in the opening months and the manner in which this was met by the co-operation of the United States. He then touched on the great increase in the Paper Currency circula-tion and its incidental results in the shape of the discount on Currency Notes and the shortage of small change. Happily signs are not wanting, he said, that people are acquiring greater confidence in the note&apos; currency, evidenced by the fact that the circulation of 1-rupee notes   now amounts to over Rs. 9,00,00,000.    The Finance7570-2a -.&apos; C
Member then referred to the marked change in exchange in the latter part of the year, paying tribute to the assistance of the commercial community in maintaining the stability of exchange, and in ensuring the finance of exports of national importance during the war.2. Current year Revenue Estimates. The financial statement contemplates that the Imperial section in the present year will close with a deficit of 4,500,000Z. as against a surplus of 2,500,000Z. estimated by Sir W. S. Meyer, the total revenue being now estimated at 85,500,000Z., and the expenditure at 90,000,0007. The revenue improvement amounts to 11,000,000Z., due to Exchange 4,250,0007.,- Railways 2,333,000Z. Customs nearly 2,000,000Z., and Mints 4,250,000. Expenditure is 18,000,0007. more than anticipated, mainly on account of the additional liability accepted by India in September last towards the maintenance of the cost of the additional troops raised in India amounting to 12,750,000Z. in the current year. The position was also affected by scarcity, the Imperial share of relief measures costing about 400,0007. apart from the loss on Land Revenue receipts of over 1,000,0007.3. Ways and Means during 1918-19.^ It is stated that the difficulties arising from- the lock-up of Government resources in London continued in an acute form during most of the year, and the total disbursements in India for which it was necessary to provide, apart&quot; from expenditure debited to Indian revenues, amounted to 141,000,0007., more than half of these representing war, outlay on behalf of the Home Government. These disbursements were financed mainly by the receipts of the Indian war loan, receipts of.silver, and the issue of currency notes against additional investments. In referring to the striking success of the War Loan, the subscribers to which numbered 228,000 against 155,000 to the preceding loau, Sir J. S. Meston emphasised the importance of fostering the development of the investing habit, both in order to provide capital for the development of the country&apos;s resources and to minimise its demand for silver, and to divert money from hoards. Progress in this direction must go hand in hand with the very necessary development and extension of banking facilities.4. Revenue Estimate, 1919-20, Imperial Account. The forecast of resources for requirements during reconstruction are no less difficult than in the war period owing to the lack of experience in calculating the legacies of the great war. On the civil side, external trade is largely governed by shipping, which makes it difficult to estimate confidently Customs revenue, or gains or loss from Exchange, while internal trade may be affected by scarcity or a slump in prices ; hence the uncertainty regarding railway earnings and other important heads of revenue. The Government have, however, felt justified in taking an optimistic view of revenue prospects. As regards expenditure, military estimates are 41,200,0007. including 8,700,0007. for the cost of the additional contribution under the September resolution. The total Imperial expendi-tttre is 85,35 7,3007. On the Revenue side the Railway estimate anticipates that the current year&apos;s revenue will be counterbalanced by heavy expenditure on repairs and renewals. Improvement is also anticipated under Customs, Stamps, Excise, and Posts and Telegraphs, set off by a falling off mainly under Mint and Exchange gains. Hi view of the great hardships caused by the present range of prices to persons on low salaries, the Government have decided to raise the minimum taxable limit of income tax from Rs. 1,000 (677.) to Rs. 2,000 (1337.), entailing a loss of 500,0007., but affording relief to 237,000 assessees out of the total number of 381,000. On the existing basis of taxation modified by this concession, the Government have to meet a deficit of over 5,000,0007. To fill the gap and to give a small surplus, an Excess Profits Duty is proposed. . Allowing for losses, the net estimated receipts from the Excess Profits Duty are placed at about 6,000,0007. Subject to the above the taxation imposed during the war is maintained. The estimated total revenue amounts to 86,225,4007.-, leaving a surplus of 868,1007.5. Provincial Finance during the Current Year. The Provinces collectively are expected to show a surplus of 1,000,0007. in spite -of the loss of land revenue due to scarcity. For 1918-19 the Provinces are authorised to draw on their balances for educational and industrial development, &amp;c, and to budget for a collective deficit of about 1,500,000Z.6. Ways and Means, 1919-20.   The outstanding feature is the capital expenditure of 17,570,000Z. on the Railway Capital Programme, aparx from the
special Revenue Renewal Programme of 6,500,000?., making a total Railway-Programme expenditure of over 24,000,000Z. The Budget provides for a new loan of 10,000,0007,., it being explained that this is an estimate only. The sum provided for Irrigation is 400,000?., it being impossible to push preparations of schemes during the war. owing to the depleted conditions of the Engineer Cadre apart from the financial stringency. The grant for New Delhi is fixed at 300,000?. The estimate for the Secretary of State&apos;s Council Bill drawings is 10,300,000?.7. Outlook for the Future. In conclusion, the necessary task before India on the financial side is coping with the reaction inevitable after the great war. The first obvious necessity is to get currency habits back to a sounder basis. The addition of 120 crores to circulation in the last four years has involved the using up of the world&apos;s current production of silver and depleting its accumulated stocks. Two conclusions are inevitable :-(a) The huge sums paid for silver bring home the wasteful and extravagant nature of what we have been doing; (6) the continuance of a demand on this scale must react, violently on the currencv and exchange policy of the Government of India, If absorption continues at the present rate it may be physically impossible to purchase sufficient silver, in which case the internal currency policy would have to be fundamentally recast. On the other hand, if by superhuman efforts the requisite amount of silver could be obtained it is more than likely that the operations would force the price up to a giddy height and throw the whole exchange policy in the melting pot. On this side the problem is being carefully examined with a view to defining the exchange and silver policy of the Government. The second task is the contraction of the note currencj&apos;. While it may not seem consistent to deplore the high figures of the Currency Note circulation after extolling the superiority of paper over metal currency, it cannot be regarded as satisfactory for the Government to finance itself by borrowing from the Paper Currency Reserve, and the time has come to make a start in the desired direction by the retiring of portions of our fiduciary issue. The third and most imminent phase of the problem is the redemption of the heavy temporary war obligations. If we cannot fund these on reasonable terms it will be necessary to redeem them as they mature. Simultaneously the Government will have irresistible claims on them for raising capital for the internal development of railways, industries, forests, and the like. Again, during the same period it will be necessary to launch into very heavy expenditure for education and the welPbeing of the people, without which political progress would be largely nugatory. In indicating the tasks ahead the Finance Member disclaimed pessimism, expressing the belief that India;s control of raw materials, for which the whole outside world will be contending, places her in a position of exceptional strength, and will exempt her from many discomforts and sufferings entailed by the reaction period on other countries. At the same time it. is necessary to face facts, and to recognise that, coupled with a courageous outlay on the essentials of progress, a strict econonry in all non-essentials in the near future will be more necessary than ever.Bolshevik Propaganda.The Viceroy informed the Secretary of State by. telegram, of March 3rd that a report from Ivashgar, dated February 28th, stated that from information received from Tashkend it appeared that Bolsheviks had prepared a large quantity of inflammatory propaganda in Persian, Hindustani, Chinese and Turki for circulation in India and China, with a view to fomenting revolution. They were sending the same through Persia and via Ivashgar. Arrangements were therefore made with the local authorities and the Russian Consul-General for thorough searches of all travellers of whatever nationality from Russian Turkestan to be enforced on the frontier. A-considerable amount of Bolshevik propaganda secretly arrived at Kashgar was seized. It was of the usual inflammatory nature, and mainly directed against the British and Chinese.
0T&amp;ER COLONIES, PROTECTORATES, &amp;c.RHODESIA.Political Future. The controversy regarding the political future of Southern Rhodesia is reported by ReuteEs correspondents to be becoming more acute between the three parties favouring respectively Crown Colony Government, responsible Government, and incorporation in the Union of South Africa.The settlers of -Northern Rhodesia are also keenly interested in that country&apos;s future, especially in view of probable rearrangements consequent upon the conclusion of peace. A meeting of the Northern Rhodesian Political Association recently resolved to notify the Imperial Government that the inhabitants desire to give expression to their views before the destiny of the territory is finally decided upon. The majority of the speakers at the meeting favoured responsible Government in conjunction with Southern Rhodesia.
