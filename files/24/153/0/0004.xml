SECRET.APPRECIATION OF THE ATTACHED REPORT No. 98.BRITISH EMPIRE AND AFRICA.Imperial Affairs.Some interesting facts arc given in this Report regarding the supply of raw materials within the Empire.Canada..The estimated war expenditure of Canada to March 31st next is a significant figure. Considerable claims against the enemy for war damage are being filed by Canadians.The latest Ministerial utterances regarding the expedition to Siberia indicate an appreciation of the importance of Canadian participation in this sphere of inter-national activity. It appears that Canadian labour inclines to take a narrower view.For probably the first time in the history of the Dominion representatives of labour, of manufacturers, and of technical organisations have jointly recommended a policy to the Government. The reconstruction proposals upon which these repre-sentatives have agreed will, therefore, receive additional weight and attention.It will be interesting to see if the temperance bodies succeed in their advocacy of the continuance of prohibition until a Referendum can be held on the subject.The steps already taken by the Dominion Government towards building a mercantile marine justify the hope of the Minister of Naval Service that in the not far distant future Canadian ships will be seen in every port of the world.Other items of interest in this Report relate to the arrangements for further credits for the United Kingdom, the Liberal Conference, Irish Home Rulers in Montreal, &amp;c.Australian Commonwealth.Mr. Hughes has made it clear to his Cabinet that he never claimed that Australia should be represented at A^ersailles, as alleged by certain political &quot; irreconcilables &quot; in Australia. The facts Mr. Hughes was able to telegraph to Australia regarding his action in connection with Peace discussions appear to have strengthened his position and to have silenced criticism the extent of which would seem to have been much exaggerated in the cables sent to the English Press.The policy of the Government regarding bases and supplies for naval and military purposes shows a determination to develop local resources and at the same time to depend upon Admiralty advice in applying the lessons of the war.[p.t.0.
2The Commonwealth position regarding the attitude of the United States towards wool prices is now clearly set forth.New Zealand.The question of prohibition appears likely to prove a live issue when the elections take place next.year.South Africa.The Ministerial statement regarding a tariff for the protection of South African industries is of particular interest.There are indications that the considerable activities of the Nationalists in their demands for an independent Republic and in their general attack upon the British connection may bring about a definite amalgamation between the South African and Unionist Parties.The attempt to unite all sections of the Labour Party in order more effectively to fight the Republican movement has apparently not succeeded in bringing the extremist &quot;War-on-war &quot; party to reason.It is clear that the Union Government do not like the condition in the British &apos; offer for wool purchase relating to possible withdrawal in case of non-registration of a certain quantity.   It is probable that a stipulation of this kind would be used by the Nationalists for political purposes.. . India. .(Excluding External Affairs.)The Report of the Indian Industrial Commission is of first-rate importance. The deficiencies in the industrial system which are pointed out, and the recommendations that are made, will no doubt have a considerable effect upon the future trading-interests of the country.The Memorandum of the Secretary of State upon &quot;the proposed Indian Colony in German East Africa is of much interest, and the extracts given regarding the probable influence of Indian immigration ujjou the natives should be particularly noted.H. d&apos;E..

BRITISH&apos; EMPIRE  AND  AFRICA  REPORT.IMPERIAL AFFAIRS.Raw Materials within the Empire. In the course,of the third Report on Raw Materials by the Committee on the Trade Relations of the United Kingdom within the Empire some interesting facts are given as to the supply of raw materials.With reference to cotton it is stated that the British Empire produces the greater part of the worhTs supply of fine cotton. The areas of profuction for fine cotton within the Empire are &apos;the West Indies, Egypt, the Sudan, Nyasaland, Uganda, East and South Africa. Of these, it is pointed out, Egypt is the most important, not only in the Empire, but in the whole world. India produces considerably more than half of the world&apos;s supply of low-grade cotton.As to clothing wools (merino and cross-bred) the Report mentions that the British Empire (Australia, New Zealand and South Africa) produces 68 per cent, of: the supplies placed on the world&apos;s market.. Regarding nickel itris mentioned that the principal deposits of nickel ore in the world belong to Canada, the only other considerable deposits being those of New Caledonia, though there are many minor sources of supply.About two-thirds of the world&apos;s production of tin is smelted in the British Empire. The Straits Settlements, the Report mentions, produce 60,000 tons, the United Kingdom 31,000 tons, and Australia about 2,500 tons. The estimated consumption of tin within the Empire is under 38 per cent, of the Empire&apos;s production.With regard to zinc, the Committee recall that enemy control over Australian zinc ores and concentrates has been destroyed by special legislation of the Common-wealth Parliament. The Report also refers to the fact that the Commonwealth Government have established, with financial assistance from the British Government, a Zinc Producers&apos;Association, which is preparing to smelt, in Australian works, a large part of the normal output of Australian zinc concentrates. Meanwhile, it is further mentioned, the British Government have contracted to buy (a) the greater part of the existing stocks of concentrates and slimes in Australia ; (6) the whole production from January 1st, 1918, until 12 months after the war up to 250,000 tons per annum; (c) and for nine years thereafter the whole production up to 300,000 tons per annum.About one-third of the world&apos;s output of tungsten is produced, according to the Report, within the British Empire.The position of the lead-smelting industry within the Empire is stated to have materially improved during the war. In 1913 the total requirements of the Empire were estimated at 233,000 tons (including 200,000 tons consumed in the United Kingdom). The production of the Empire in the same year was only 161,000 tons, of which 114,000 tons were produced in Australia. In 1916 the output of the United Kingdom smelters was about 80,000 tons. The Australian smelters have a capacity of 200,000 tons per annum.The quantity of copper smelted within the Empire was about 112,000 tons in 1913, of which 81,000 tons were produced from Empire ores. The three principal smelting centres within the Empire were in the United Kingdom, Australia, and Canada the United Kingdom producing 52,000 tons, Australia 42,000. tons, and Canada 14,000 tons. During the war the policy has been to buy for war require-ments from the United States, and the only notable extension has been in Canada, where the local smelters produced 50,000 tons in 1916.The rubber production of the world in 1916 was about 200,000 tons, and, the Report states, about 180,000 tons of this total were produced within the British Empire chiefly in the Federated Malay States, the Straits Settlements, and Ceylon.
SELF-GOVERNING   DOMINIONS.CANADA.Cost of War. In response to a request from the British Government for a statement showing the total war expenditure of the Dominion from August 1st, 1914, to March 31st, 1919 (partly estimated), to be utilised in connection with peace negotiations, the Dominion Government have telegraphed that the war expenditure of Canada to November 30th amounts to $1,068,000,000, and to March 31st is estimated to amount to $1,290,000,000. In this calculation the maintenance of the. army in France is taken at 6s. per man and not at the suggested increased rate of 9s. 4d. In addition to this estimate, it is pointed out that the amount of the war outlay to be incurred after March 31st, 1919, is estimated as possibly exceeding $300,000,000. The cost of pensions is estimated at $30,000,000 per annum.As to the increase in the debt of the Dominion due to the war, it is pointed out that the net debt of Canada to March 31 st, 1914, was 1336,000,000, while to March 31st, 1919, it is estimated to reach .$1,500,000,000.Claims for Indemnities. With reference to the list of claims by Canadians against the &quot;enemy (vide Report No. 96), it is announced in Ottawa that claims numbering several- thousands and aggregating many millions of dollars are being-filed with the Secretary of State, demanding compensation for damages in connection with the war.. The bulk of them are presented by people in Canada who had investments in Russia, while another large class represents claims for damages in the loss of shipping due to submarine warfare.The Siberian Expedition. The President of the Privy Council (Mr. N. W. Powell), speaking at Port Hope, Ontario, said the opinion was unanimous that the remainder of the Siberian Expeditionary Force should be sent as agreed. The Minister added that he hoped the situation in the East would be cleared up at an early date, but in the event of a member of the force wishing to return before the end of the Expedition, he might do so within a year of the date, of the signing of the armistice.A resolution caUing upon the Government to withdraw the Canadian troops from Siberia has been adopted by the District Trades and Labour Council at Toronto. The resolution was first passed at Vancouver and is being circulated throughout the Trades&apos; Unions in the country. Peterboro and Winnipeg Trades and Labour Councils have also taken similar action.Trade Conventions with France. The French Government have renounced the trade conventions made in 1907 and 1909 with Canada. The preferential tariff rates remain, however, in force, subject to three months&apos; notice. The Dominion Government have concurred in these decisions.-Reconstruction Programme: Joint action of Labour and Manufacturers.  Representatives of organised labour, the great manufacturing interests of the country and technical organisations have agreed upon a policy to be recommended to the Government. The recommendations deal with matters to be carried out in connection with the reconstruction period, and the memorial, which is now being considered by the Cabinet, is the result of a conference between the several interests held in Ottawa. The memorial suggests in a general way the appointment of a Bureau of Public Welfare ; the establishment of a Bureau to take a survey of imports; the refining or manufacture in the Dominion of raw materials ; scientific and industrial research; immigration; the immediate commencement of public works ; an aggressive land settlement policy ; the establishment of employment&quot; bureaux; greater utilisation and development of Canadian water powers ; co-operation between the Militia Department and the Government Employment Bureaux in the problem of demobilisation ; commencement of an &quot; optimism campaign,&quot; in which the newspapers of the Dominion would be asked to assist.The memorial is signed by the official representatives of the Trades and Labour Congress of Canada, the Canadian Manufacturers&apos; Association and a joint committee of technical organisations.Suggested Referendum on Prohibition. The continuation of prohibition until the question is finally settled by referendum has been urged on the Government by a
delegation representing the Dominion Prohibition. Committee and other temperance-bodies in the Dominion.After presenting their memorial, the delegates&apos; handed out a public statement, declaring the Dominion Prohibition Committee had a conference with the leaders of the various temperance .forces in all the Provinces, and have evidence of a strong-public sentiment in favour of the continuance of prohibition until&apos;&quot; the period of demobilisation is ended.   There is also a strong public sentiment for postponing any enactment on the prohibition question until such time as the soldiers return home and have taken up their civil pursuits, and are able to express their will not only on this but on all other public questions.   The prohibition leaders find themselves in. full sympathy with this opinion, and ask that the prohibition question be submitted, to the electorate at a time to be&quot;fixed by the Government, but this day should not be until the soldiers have returned to Canada ; in the meantime, they ask that the present Order jjih Council be made law b3^ Act of Parliament.Dominion Mercantile Marine. The first of the ships of the Dominion Govern-ment&apos;s new mercantile marine fleet have been launched by the Canadian - Vickers yards at Montreal, when the steamers Canadian Pioneer and Canadian Voyager took the water after their christening by Lady Borden. The Canadian Pioneer is a vessel of 8,100 tons, and the Canadian Voyager is 4,350 tons. The keel of the former was laid on July 18th last. At the luncheon following the launching ceremony, the Minister of Marine and Naval Service (Mr.. C. C Ballautyne) announced that the Government have under construction at the present time 39 steel vessels. He pointed out that the Government are providing the necessary shipping facilities in order to-enable Canadian manufacturers and business men to secure a substantial share of the export trade offering in Great Britain, the other overseas Dominions and in Allied countries. The Minister looked forward to the time when the flag of the Canadian mercantile marine would be seen in every important port in the world over ships carrying products of the mine, field, forest and industrial centres of the Dominion.It is stated that the Governments fleet will be under the control of a Board of Directors, who will be given a free hand in its management and operation.The Department of Marine and Naval Service have authorised the statement that before the end of the year four steel ships (one of 3,750 tons, one of 4,300 tons, and two each of 8,100 tons) will be launched. Fifteen ships fwill be launched between January 1st and June of next year, while during the following six months-12 more-ships will be launched. The outlay represented amounts to between 50 and 60 million, dollars.Further Credits for United Kingdom. The Minister of Finance has arranged with the British Government further credits aggregating about $200,000,000 for the-coming year. Of this amount, about $50,000,000 will be required to complete the programme of the Imperial Munitions Board of Canada, and $50,000,000 for the purchase of grain from this years crops. The remaining $100,000,000 will cover the purchase of meats and dairy produce. Until the exchange conditions between Britain and the United States improve, it will be necessary for Canada to continue to-find large credits in the purchase of Canadian products by the United Kingdom.Liberal Conference. It is announced that Sir Wilfrid Laurier is communicating with the Liberal Associations in the Provinces, asking them to select representatives to consult and confer with him and other Liberal members of the Commons. It is expected that the delegates from all parts of the country will number 120. It is-stated that in addition to setting out plans to deal with immediate conditions in the country, the conference will submit an outline of the procedure to be followed in assembling the National Liberal Convention on a date to be selected after the-delegates have consulted the local associations.Irish Home Rule. A demonstration planned at Montreal by local Irishmen, in aid of draft resolutions to be presented to the Peace Conference in support of autonomy for Ireland, has been postponed until the results of the British elections are known. Dr. J. K. Foran, Chairman of the general Committee formed to organise the-demonstration, states that many influential Irishmen whose -support was solicited were unwilling to pledge themselves until they knew with whom they had to deal and what the new representatives for Ireland might demand.Manufactured Food Products.-The Minister of Immigration and Colonisation (Mr. James A. Calder) reports that the marked expansion in Canadian farm production under the stimulus of the war has been followed by an eAren greater increase in the-
output of manufactured food products, the value of which&quot; has grown from some 389,000,000 dollars in 1915 to more than 755,000,000 dollars in 1917.Silver Production. The silver production of the Province of Ontario for the first nine months of the current year shows an increase of nearly half a million dollars over, that of the corresponding period of last year.-AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH.Peace Terms: Position of Mr. Hughes in Australia. With reference to the Resolutions of Chambers of Commerce and State Legislatures as to Australia&apos;s claim to the Pacific (vide Report No. 96), other cables have indicated that there was some difference of opinion in political circles, and that the Prime Minister had.not the entire support of his Party. Later advices, however, show that a section of the National Party, who, just before Mr. Hughes&apos; departure for England, attempted a political coup in the caucus and failed, sought to take advantage of the public criticism of Mr. Hughes in the Press in order to prevent Mr. Hughes&apos; continuance as Leader of the Party. This section combated Mr. Hughes&apos; alleged claim for &quot; representation at Versailles,&quot; and it was contended that he had no right to make such a claim. Mr. Hughes, however, has recently communicated with his Cabinet, pointing out that he never demanded the representation of Australia at Versailles in connection with the armistice, and only asked that Australia should be consulted before the terms of peace were &quot;settled. Mr. Hughes laid the whole facts before his colleagues, and pointed out to them that the terms of peace and Aiistralia&apos;s interests in connection therewith had been seriously affected by the acceptance of President Wilson&apos;s Fourteen Points (with the modifications of clauses regarding the freedom of the seas and reparation) as the basis of peace. The Acting Prime Minister (Mr. Watt) read Mr. Hughes&apos; cable to the House of Representatives, and at the same time stated that the Cabinet had cabled to Mr. Hughes prior to the Arersailles Conference, objecting to Clauses 2, 3, and 5 (vide Report No. 96) of President Wilson&apos;s Points, and stating that they would be distinctly unacceptable to &quot;the Australian people and menacing to their future safety and prosperity.The latest communications received from Australia show that the statements cabled to the English Press were exaggerated. Mr. Hughes&apos; cable was regarded in the House as satisfactory, and it disposed of the criticism there. The dissentient members appear to be making no headway, and the latest reports indicate that there is no likelihood of Mr. Hughes&apos; leadership being threatened.Construction of Naval Bases. The Acting Prime Minister (Mr. Watt) stated in the House of Representatives in connection with the Loan Works Bill for 1,2-12,19 U., that the Ministry had decided to reconsider the programme for the construction of naval bases. Various cables had passed between tire Australian Naval Board and the British Admiralty on the question whether the Henderson Naval Base programme should be modified. The Admiralty, he said, were not prepared to advise fully in view of the enormous pressure placed on them by the war, but gave certain advice for interim guidance. In view of this, and of further advice from Sir Joseph Coot, the Minister for the Navy now in London, the Ministry had decided to complete the Flinders Base, costing a further sum of 150,000Z., but to suspend construction of the Fremantle Base, and other stages of the Henderson programme, involving expenditure running into several millions, pending arrangements being made for a British naval expert to visit Australia and review the naval fleet and base position in the light of the lessons of the war.Construction of Arsenal. The Acting Prime Minister has also announced that the Commonwealth Government have decided temporarily to hold up the construction of the arsenal, to permit of a report being obtained from Great Britain. This did not mean, he said, the abandonment of the project, but merely a pause to ensure that right lines should be followed. Another reason for going slow was that the modern equipment would probably be easily obtained when the munition factories abroad were scrapped.   Mr. Watt&apos;s statement was approved on all sides.&apos;.-  ;7001-2a-&apos;-  -&apos;-   &apos;-- r. \- B ;&quot;;; -\- &apos; &apos;&quot;&apos;-
Work of Repatriation Department.-A. summary of the work of the Repatriation! Department up to October 31st shows that of 78,511 discharged men the Department were called on to make provision for 68,334. Regarding 52,536 killed or died, the Department dealt with 34,588 applications for assistance from dependants. The policy of the Department was to return fit men to their previous or similar occupations. Applications for positions, but not the number of individual applicants, totalled: 25,345 ; the number placed in positions was 20,970, the number of applications-lapsed, was 2,653 ; the number awaiting employment is 1,722 with 1,242 positions -offering.   Current monthly applications are now being met.Wool for Allies. With reference to the telegram from the British Government regarding wool for Allied military purposes (vide Report No. 96), the Commonwealth Government have set but in a cable to the British authorities the record of wool negotiations from their initiation. In the course of this it is stated that when the United States, entered the war they still continued buying South Airican and Argentine wools at.prices exceeding the Australian parity and also paid more than Australian parity for home-grown United States wool. This, it is stated, placed the Commonwealth Government in a difficult position and created unrest among Australian wool growers. The Commonwealth Government submit that it is neither sound nor equitable for. the United States to request terms and conditions for the highest grades of wools on a parity basis for the whole Australian clip, and they ask that the United States should reconsider the matter. They add that the United States representatives must realise that their request amounts practically to a demand that Australian wool growers shall accept lower prices than those paid to United States wool growers.NEW ZEALAND.Referendum on Prohibition. The Liquor Bill has been passed by the Dominion Parliament. According to a Renter message, the Bill provides for a national referendum, probably in April, on the question of the continuance of licences or prohibition with compensation. A bare majority will decide. If prohibition is hot carried at the.referendum, it is stated that there will be three issues on the liquor question at the subsequent elections, namely, the continuance of licences, uncompen-sated -prohibition, or State purchase and control. An absolute majority of votes will carry any .one of these issues.SOUTH  AFRICA.Acting Prime Minister. During the absence of General Botha from South Africa, his place will be taken by Mr. F. S. Malan, the Minister of Mines and Industries.Customs Tariff. The Minister of Mines and Industries (Mr. F. S. Malan), speaking on November 28th, stated that an advisory committee had been instructed to draft a customs tariff enabling South African industries to keep their heads above water and to prevent the country becoming a dumping ground. Previous tariffs, he declared, had been framed solely with an eye to revenue. To a certain extent, the question of revenue would be borne in mind, but the future maintenance of South African industries would always be very largely kept in view.Republicanism and Dominion Representation. The Leader of the Cape Nationalists (Doctor Malan), in a recent speech at Laclismith, made a lengthy statement on the doctrine of Republicanism for South Africa as enunciated by &quot;the Nationalist Party.. He claimed that, if the position of South. Africa were placed before President Wilson at the Peace Conference, President Wilson would use his influence in favour of South Africa attaining the independence to which it had a greater, right than Alsace-Lorraine, Ireland, Schleswig-Ilolstein or any other part of the world. Doctor Malan also condemned the recent arrangement under which the Dominions were to be continuously represented in the Imperial War Cabinet, contending that this would bring South Africa into the maelstrom of Imperialism,.and would bind her down more than ever.
Suggested Amalgamation of South-African and Unionist Parties. In connection with the Nationalist agitation for an independent Republic, the Leader of the Transvaal Unionists (Mr. Patrick Duncan, M.L.A.), in a recent speech forecasted the possibility of great changes, and said that it might be necessary to give up the old landmarks of Unionist policy and be prepared to work with people holding the same principles regarding the British connection.This speech was followed by a leading article in the Johannesburg Star on December 2nd, in which the paper urged the amalgamation of the South African Party with the Unionists as a matter of national urgency. The newspaper emphasised the fact that the best hope -for the future lies in the determination of all South Africans who are loyal to the Constitution and the maintenance of the link of Empire, and who wish to see the country progress on orderly and non-revolutionary lines, to stand shoulder to shoulder in defence of the larger ideal of South Africans continued development as an integral part of the Commonwealth of nations.The Labour Party. It is reported from Johannesburg that a largely attended meeting of the Administrative Council of the South African Labour Party recently rescinded the resolution of October 1915, expelling those who, before resigning the membership of the Party, joined the International Socialist League, or any other party. The Central Executive of the Labour Party have passed a Resolution declaring &quot; The war being happily at an end, differences arising therefrom are now removed, and a welcome is extended, to all who accept the Socialist objective of the Party.&quot; Mr. Andrews, the leading spirit of the &quot; War on War&quot; section of Labour, and the organiser fof the International Socialist League, has rejected the Labour Party&apos;s suggestions and declared that the breach is final and fundamental.Commercial Treatment of the Enemy. At a special meeting of members of the Witwatersrand Commercial Exchange, a resolution was passed excluding from membership or representation on the Exchange any person or firm .of enemy nationality, and also urging the Union Government, the Chamber of Mines and the Witwatersrand municipalities not to jjurchase goods of enemy origin for at least 5 years after the war.Closing of Low-grade Mines. The Minister of Mines and Industries has appointed a Departmental Committee to enquire into the question of the closing-down of the low-grade mines.The Wool Clip. With reference to previous communications on the subject (aide Report No. 9t)the British Government informed the Union Government by telegram of December 3rd that the cessation of hostilities had greatly reduced the wool requirements for military purposes and that it was impossible to offer better terms for South African wool than those offered to Australia and New Zealand. The Union Government were, however, authorised to offer, on behalf of the British authorities, to purchase the new wool clip of all South African farmers who registered their wool before December 20th subject to the price being 55 per cent, over schedule of 1913-14 prices (as amended by the Central Wool Committee in their telegram of October 25th), the British Government agreeing that in the event of their making a profit on the resale of the wool one half of the profit should be paid to the Union Government for distribution amongst the farmers. The telegram added that the British Government reserved the right to withdraw from the purchase altogether if the total wool registered for sale should be less than 200,000 bales. The reason for the reservation was stated to be that it would be very disadvantageous to the British Government to acquire small quantities of lower grade wools which were not freely marketable, and the registration of 200,000 bales would, it was thought, secure a reasonable proportion of all grades of wool.In reply the Union Government state that the reservation regarding withdrawal would discourage the farmers from registering their wool owing to the uncertainty which would prevail as to whether sales would actually be effected. They point out that they do not share the view that unless 200,000 bales are registered a large percentage of low-grade wools would be offered,&quot;as it is intended to make it a condition that each farmer who registers must register the whole of his clip. The Union Ministers express their earnest hope that the British Government will agree to accept whatever wool is offered, which would greatly help those farmers who register and the country as a whole. It is also suggested that the period fixed for registration should be extended to December 31st.   .7001 2ac
INDIA.(Excluding External Affairs, which are dealt with in the Eastern Report.)Report of Industrial Commission. The Report of the Indian Industrial Corn-mission, 1916-18, which was appointed in May 1916 under the chairmanship of Sir Thomas Holland, recommends many important changes in Government policy. The Report gives a loug catalogue, described as &quot; almost ominous,&quot; of industries which, though their products are essential m peace and war, are lacking in India. Until they are brought into existence on an adequate scale, Indian capitalists will, in times of peace, be deprived of a number of profitable enterprises ; whilst in the event of a war which renders sea transport impossible, India&apos;s all-important existing industries will be exposed to the risk of stoppage, her consumers to great hardship, and her armed forces to the gravest possible danger. Certain very specialised and&apos; essential industries must be set up &quot;at the earliest possible date,&quot; and it will be necessary for the Government to fake special steps to this end.It is held  hat many of the difficulties which have been experienced by industrialists in India will be surmounted or modified by the large administrative and technical Government organisation proposed. This will at any rate ensure technical advice for the small industry, and adequate economic and scientific data for all classes of undertakings.In order to meet the difficulties experienced by small and middle-class industrialists in obtaining financial facilities, and generally to provide a more elastic system of industrial finance, the Report states that industrial banks are needed. An expert committee should be appointed to consider what additional banking facilities are necessary, and what form of Government assistance or control will be required to ensure their extension on sound lines.Since, however, the adequate extension of industrial banks will be a matter of time, the Report outlines a scheme for financing middle-class industrialists.The Commission recommend the creation -of an organisation for the purchase and inspection of stores in India, to work under the proposed Departments of Industry.Economy in Provincial Budgets. The Government of India have addressed the Provincial Governments emphasising the need of economy in the Budget Estimates in view of the heavy cost of demobilisation. Additional expenditure, however, may be reasonably incurred, in. the extension of education where it has been specially hampered by war economies, in the development of industries, the repair of actual damage caused by financial stringency to public institutions, and in services also for such purposes as capital outkvy for the development of forests and agricultural experiments.Proposed Indian Colony in German East Africa. -In the course of a memorandum circulated to the War Cabinet (G.T. 6407), the Secretary of State for India has dealt with some of the objections raised to the proposed Colony for India in German East &quot; Africa. In this memorandum it is pointed, out that India feels profoundly the restrictions which the self-governing Dominions have thought fit to impose, and recognises her powerlessness to resist the main principle. If any sympathy can be shown to her feelings by definite action, it would, it is submitted, make a deep impression throughout India. German East Africa is stated to present the opportunity, and if India could be permitted to colonise it as Sir Theodore Morison suggested, she would have the satisfaction of knowing that at any rate in one substantial territory she was being given the same opportunity of colonial enterprise as the European enjoys elsewhere.As to Indian immigration prejudicing the interests of the native races (vide Report No. 95) the Secretary of Stats points out that the alternatives are not Indian immigration or no immigration, but Indian immigration or European immigration ; and various reasons are advanced for thinking that Indian immigration would be more advantageous to the native than European immigration. Mr. Montagu further observes that the Indian coolie is not a type of Indian whom he should hope to see colonising Africa, but the soldier who has fought for the Empire.   The Jat and
Punjabi Mussalman he mentions as fine upstanding types of men who would be a revelation to East Africa.If German East Africa is made over to the Government of India for administration and the regulation of Indian colonisation, it would be a cardinal principle that this colonisation should be regulated in the interests of the native population.The Secretary of State adds that he does not necessarily press Sir T. Morison&apos;s actual suggestion that German East Africa should be given to India as a Colony, but that he would be quite content if special facilities were given to Indian soldiers for colonisation there.
