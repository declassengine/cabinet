SECRET.APPRECIATION  OP THEE ATTACHED REPORT No. 105.BRITISH  EMPIRE  AND AFRICA.Canada.The Canadian Manufacturers have promptly met the free trade position of the Western Grain Growers by a statement arguing that the policy advocated would create widespread unemployment.The steps taken by the Dominion Government indicate that when the Air Board is formed considerable developments in aviation may be expected in the Dominion.There appears to be no lack of employment amongst skilled workers, and the Department of Labour does, not anticipate serious unemployment in any direction.It could not, of course, be anticipated that the large excess of exports over imports would be maintained.The intention to get all Dominion troops back to Canada by the end of August has beeu officially emphasised on several occasions.The decision of the Trade Union delegates to form a single Industrial Workers&apos; Union for Australia will probably have a considerable influence upon the future of the Labour movement in the Commonwealth, both from the industrial and political standpoints.The people of the Dominion will apparently have to decide in April upon the question of national prohibition.It can hardly be expected that General Hertzog and his co-delegates to Europe look upon their mission with any enthusiasm. The reception in Europe of the Nationalist claim for independence may perhaps exercise a sobering influence upon the extremists.It is characteristic of the Nationalists that they should even seize upon a statement as to the pre-war existence of a &quot; war book &quot; (which, of course, had no reference to any contemplated attack on South-West Africa) as a means of criticising the Government for an aggressive policy towards Germany.The Unionists have indicated the serious view they take of the probable resultsAustralian Commonwealth.New Zealand.South Africa.of Republican propaganda.-[p.t.o.
The real answer to the Nationalist attitude is contained in a recent observation of the Acting Prime Minister as to the Union having been recognised at the Peace Conference as occupying a status of political ecpiality with the small nations. Members of the South African Party are indicating their desire that the Union should be represented in the League of Nations.The Public Health Bill will be perhaps the most important Government measure of the present Parliamentary session.India.(^Excluding External Affairs.) The political  pai&apos;ties are naturally attaching considerable importance to  the Parliamentary Select Committee in London which will consider the Bill embodying the Reform Scheme.Foreign Colonies in Africa.German Wireless and the German Press are endeavouring to show that the. non-return of the Colonies to Germany is a violation of President Wilson&apos;s Fourteen Points as accepted by the Allies.H. d&apos;E.February 6th, 1919.

9BRITISH  EMPIRE   AND   AFRICA  REPORT.IMPERIAL AFFAIRS.British Empire Delegation.-At the meeting of- the British Empire Delegation m Paris on January 29th, the question of the application of the mandatory principle to the former German and Turkish territories was discussed.Meeting of Allied and Associated Ministers. At the meeting of the Allied and Associated Ministers held in Paris on January 30th, a resolution regarding the appli-cation of the mandatory system and the constitution of the League of hJations m reference to the appointment of mandatories were amongst the matters discussed.SELF-GOVERNING   DOMINIONS.&quot;  CANADA.Manufacturers and Tariffs. A statement has been issued hy the Canadian Manufacturers&apos; Association, through its Toronto office, defining the attitude of that organisation on the tariff question. Particular attention is given in the statement to the demands of the Western Grain Growers for a radical change in the tariff of the Dominion.The statement says: &quot;Manufacturers who transferred Canadian industry.from peace to war conditions are not afraid of the task of, transferring it back again, but they ask for liberty to devote their ^entire energies to its accomplishment. Therefore the Canadian Manufacturers&apos; Association believes.that the country should concentrate on the task of returning to peace conditions.&quot;Referring specifically to the demand of the western Grain Growers the Association says: &quot; It is fair to assume that the resolutions were designed not merely to make slight changes in the tariff, but rather to abolish it entirely, thereby revolutionising the present fiscal system.&quot;The statement urges that all tariff controversies be postponed until the immense problem of readjustment rendered necessary by the change from war to peace conditions is settled, and it declares that the bulk of the industrial workers of the Dominion are behind the Association in this matter.After stating that if ever Canada needed courage, initiative and united effort, now was the time, the manufacturers proceed : &quot;The bulk of the Army will have to be re-absorbed by commerce, especially by the manufacturing interests, which must try to provide work for those workers who really need it. Yet at the very time when reconstruction seems to be crystallising into the hope that the manufacturers will be able to&apos; furnish the necessary employment, a fiscal policy is advocated which, if put into effect, would close down many factories and reduce the staffs of others. The possibility of anything approaching free trade would create immediate and widespread, unemployment, and unemployment would breed social unrest, which is something that does not require encouragement in Canada at the present time.&quot;Aviation Plans. With a view to encouraging aerial science in the Dominion, the Canadian Government have secured considerable plants and equipment from the Imperial Munitions Board. Following the demobilisation of the Royal Air Force, the Board  placed  the  plants and equipment at  the disposal of  the Canadian
Government. The Government selected the aerodrome and aeroplane plant at Camp Borden, together with the training grounds and other properties at the camp. This includes 50 aeroplanes available for future training uses. The camp at Long Branch,, near Toronto, has also been taken over by the Government.An Air Board is now in process of formation, so that definite plans of the-Canadian aerial service are unavailable at present.Unemployment: Skilled and Unskilled Labour. It appears from reports received by the Dominion Department of Labour for the period ending 31st December that unemployment among trades unionists in Canada in the branches of skilled work is so small as to be almost negligible. Although still incomplete, the reports are regarded as a fairly satisfactory indication of the actual conditions prevailing. It is expected that the next three or four months will show some increase in unemployment, but nowhere is it felt that it will reach alarming proportions. The class most likely to feel the pinch is that of unskilled labour, but it is believed that the situation is not likely to become serious. With the advent of spring there will come much activity in building, railway construction, public works, and other branches of development work which will provide employment for many thousands of men.Excess of Exports over Imports. The Dominions excess of exports over imports during the calendar year 1918 reached approximately $322,500,000. This figure represents a decrease of about -$220,000,000 as compared with the trade balance in 1917, and a falling off of $2,750,000 as against 1916. One reason for the decrease is that Canada is now storing a much heavier stock of wheat than a year ago owing to. the smaller demand for grain following the cessation of hostilities.Return of Troops to Canada. The Minister of Militia (Major-General S. C. Mewburn) in a statement last week at Toronto said : &quot; We hope to have all our troops back in Canada by the end of August.&quot;The Department of Militia had previously issued an announcement to this effect when it was mentioned : ;&apos; For the present there will be no speeding up in the return of troops beyond the numbers already arranged for 20,000 in January, increasing to 30,000 in February ; but in the spring and summer months the number returning to Canada will rise to 45,000 monthly. Several factors enter into the considerations governing the return of these troops to Canada, such as transportation afloat and ashore, the undesirability of returning too many men during the winter months, and the difficulties of securing the smooth and expeditious return to civil occupations of these men without over-taxing the limits of the organisations arranged for that latter purpose.&quot;Dominion Shell Production. It is announced at Ottawa that over 65,000,000 shells, ranging from 13-pounders to those of 9&apos;2 inch calibre, were purchased in Canada by the Imperial Munitions Board since its inception to the&apos; close of hostilities. .Repatriation of Aliens.  The Minister of Labour (Senator Robertson), speaking at Hamilton (Out.), is reported in the Press to have asserted that no alien should hold a place needed by returned soldiers, and he announced that aliens would be repatriated at Government expense if necessary.AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH.Industrial Workers&apos; Union. It is announced that at the Inter-State Conference of Trade Union, delegates held in Melbourne last month, the formation of one large Union, to be termed the Industrial Workers&apos; Union of Australia, was decided upon. According to Press reports it was decided, that there should be National Departmental Councils consisting of 12 elected members, subject to recall. The Conference also resolved to constitute Provincial Councils for each State consisting of six members, the President and General Secretary to hold office for a year, and to be subject to recall, and local autonomy to be exercised, subject to certain limitations.Many Australian newspapers and labour leaders have expressed disapproval of the idea of one large Union, stating that it savours of I.W.W. methods, and will ruin the labour movement &quot;Both industrially and politically.The Acting Labour Premier of Queensland (Mr. Theodore) has denounced in strong terms the I. WAV. and has declared that Labour should have nothing to do with those connected with the movement.7378-la- A 2
Soldiers for Northern Territory. The Commonwealth G-overnment have arranged to send ont parties of returnee! soldiers to the Northern Territory in order to. prospect for gold and other minerals. &apos; &quot;.&quot;New South Wales Industries.-The preliminary report on the manufactories and works of New South Wales during 1917-18 shows that the number of factories was 5,418, as compared with 5,856 in 1916-17 ; the. number of persons employed was 120,988, as compared with 117,997 in 1916-17. The average wage for males has been 118/.. 16s. and for females 60L 9s. Id.Federal Capital. The Commonwealth Government have decided not to re-open at present the question of designs for the parliamentary and other buildings of Canberra, the projected capital of Australia.Tin Plate Manufacture.-The manufacture of tin plate, on a large scale will-shortly commence in the Commonwealth.NEW ZEALAND.Notional Prohibition. With reference to the Liquor Bill recently passed by the Dominion Parliament (vide Report No. 98), it is stated in the Press that a special licensing poll of all the electors of New Zealand (including members of the Expedi-tionary Forces who may be out of the Dominion) has been fixed for April 10th. Two alternative proposals are to be submitted, namely : (1) That national prohibition with compensation (the aggregate limit of which is fixed at 4,500,000L) shall come into force throughout New Zealand ;(2) That licences for the sale of intoxicating liquor shall continue to be granted.The result is to be determined by a bare majority. If the result is in favour of national prohibition, the termination will come into force on June 30th, 1919. If the decision is in favour of national continuance, there will be submitted, at the next ordinary licensing poll three proposals : (1) National continuance ; (2) national prohibition without compensation ; (3) State purchase and control.SOUTH AFRICA.Nationalist Delegation to Europe. According to the leading Nationalist news-paper&quot; De Burger the Nationalist Delegation which is proceeding to Europe in the hope of interviewing President Wilson or of obtaining leave to present a petition for independence to the Peace Conference, sails on February 11th. Two of the delegates chosen at the Bloemfontein Congress General de Wet, for the Orange Free State Province, and Mr. Grobler, for the Transvaal Province-have been refused passports, as they are still under restrictions (which will not be withdrawn until after the peace settlement), owing to their participation in the rising of 1914.Two of the chief delegates are General Hertzog and Dr. Malan (editor of De Burger), who was recently elected to the Union Parliament for the Calvinia District of Cape Province.Unionists and Republicanism. In the House of Assembly on January 22nd, the Leader of the Opposition, Sir Thomas Smartt, gave notice that he would move on February 11th : &quot; That this House condemns the agitation now being carried on for the dissolution of the Union and the severance of the connection at present existing between South Africa and Great Britain, and further expresses its opinion that such --agitation, if persisted in, will lead to civil war and bloodshed in South Africa.&quot;Nationalists and &quot; War Book.&quot; The Nationalists have attempted to make some capital out of a speech made by Lord Harcourt on November 19th, 1918, in which he stated that &quot;an individual war book &quot; was &quot;locked in the safeof each of the Governors of the Empire two years before the war. Mr. Malan, the Acting Premier, replying to a question.on the subject in the House of Assembly on January-23rd, said that the book in question explained the latest measures for the defence of the vulnerable points of the Empire and had no special application to war with Germany. Mr. Malan emphasised the fact that no plans for an attack on German Soutk-West Africa had been discussed at the Imperial Conference or by the Committee of Imperial Defence in 1911, and that no such plan was in existence in 1914.Status of South Africa. In the course of his. speech in the House of Assembly, to which attention was called in the last Report, the Acting Prime Minister (Mr. Malan),
--after expressing regret at the absence of General Botha, said he rejoiced&apos;at the Prime Minister&apos;s presence at the Peace Conference, which meant the raising of the status of the Union to that of one of equality with the snlall nations.south African Party and League of Natioiis. The Executive Committee of the South African Party in the Cape Province has adopted a Resolution, in the course of which a request is made to General Botha to obtain similar representation for the Union of South Africa in the League of Nations as that of the other Dominions. The Resolution also expresses opposition to Republican propaganda, which, if persisted in, will, it is stated, again plunge South Africa into the deepest misery.South Africa s Debt. In the course of his speech in the House of Assembly on January 24th, the Minister of Finance expressed regret that the recent internal loan for the purpose of repaying South Africa&apos;s indebtedness to the Imperial Government had not met Avith a greater response, but, in view of the epidemic and the Armistice, hie considered that, they had done extremely well in reducing the amount by 600,000t. He Ihoped, however, that South Africa would exert still greater efforts in order to repay her debt.Soldiers&apos;&apos; Services in the War. -Speaking in the House of Assembly last week, the Leader of the Opposition (Sir Thomas Smartt) moved a lengthy Resolution in favour of a select committee to enquire into the services rendered by South Africans during the war and to make recommendations, especiaUy with reference to enrolment, pay, discharge, pensions, vocational training, &amp;c. A number of amendments were tabled, -one by the Labour member. Colonel Oreswell, in favour of the inclusion of South Africans who had served independently in the Imperial units ; and another by the Nationalist, Mr. A^au Niekerk, in favour of similar pensions for ex-Republicans who had fought in the Boer war and their dependants. A further amendment hy the Ministerialist, Mr. Ham man, was in favour of similar pensions for those who had been wounded in previous wars withinthe boundaries of the Union. Sir Thomas Smartt, in mewing-the Resolution, urged the co-ordination of the efforts Avhich Avould presently be made in various departments, and also strongly urged increased pensions and children&apos;s -allowances, emphasising that the time had come for the Union to recognise its obliga-tions and take over the Avhole charges of the Union troops from the Imperial forces. The Unionist, Major Van Zil, seconded the Resolution, and a number of other minor amendments were moved to Avhicli the Government had not replied before the debate Avas adjourned.Public Health Bill. In the House of Assembly, on January 29th, Sir Thomas Watt moved the second -reading of the Public Health Bill. He stated that during the Avar the Union forces lost ,6,395 whites, 692 coloured people and 1,105 natives, Avhile the recent epidemic carried off 11,726 whites and 127,745 natives and coloured people. The Bill creates a portfolio of Public Health with a central health adminis-tration, and] it also contains precisions dealing with special diseases such as tuberculosis, smallpox and venereal disease.INDIA.(Excluding External Affairs, which are dealt rath in the Eastern Report.)Reform Scheme. It was reported last month by cables sent to the Press, that considerable interest was attaching to the attendance of the heads of provinces at Delhi to consult with the Viceroy on the reforms. The belief prevailed that the criticisms they Avere advancing were&quot; of a constructive character.Reports from similar sources showed that all the political parties appeared anxious to giA^e eAridence before the Parliamentary Select Committee in London, to which the Bill embodying reforms will be referred Avhen introduced. Dr. Nair emphasized this in speeches at Madras, affirming that the non-Brahmins will have an. opportunity of going before an impartial committee sitting in public, with the British Press Avatehing.South African Indian Congress. The South African Indian Congress, repre-senting Indians in the Transvaal, Natal and Cape ProAunces, passed a Resolution last
-week requesting the Government,&quot; in view of the fact that, since the inauguration of the Union, British Indian subjects have derived very little benefit from it,&quot; to amend the laws &quot;operating oppressively&quot; against them, including the Act prohibiting the free movement of Indians throughout the Union. Speakers representing all three provinces were generally agreed in asserting that the position of Indians was worse under the Union than it had been before.The Congress decided to send at least two delegates each from the Transvaal, Natal and Cape Provinces to attend a special session of the Indian National Congress in Lou don for the purpose of supporting the claims for Indian autonomy. The delegates were also authorised to plead for the cause of the South African Indians. It was further resolved to urge the Imperial Government not to cede German South-West Africa to the Union until the &quot; obnoxious laws &quot; in the Union were repealed.FOREIGN COLONIES,   &amp;c. IN AFRICA.GERMAN COLONIES.German Opinion upon Colonies.-German Wireless of January 29th reported that &quot;A great sensation, which is also reflected in the Press, has been caused in political circles in Germany by a report issued by the Dutch News Bureau, according-to which, during a sitting of the Upper Allied Council on January 27th, an agreement was arrived at between France and England that the colonies are in no case to be given back to Germany, and that on- the ground that no U-boat bases can be established. It is stated that America&apos;s view on this matter is unknown, but the Dutch News Bureau reports, on the other hand, that France, in case the conception of the French and British delegations were to meet with support, would put forward a claim for the Camerun, Belgium for the Tabora region on the western banks of the Victoria Nyassa and a portion of the zone on the western bank of the Congo. As this latter territory belongs to Portugal, Portugal would also make claims for compensa-tiou. The Berlin newspapers publish the report under the heading &apos; The Robbery of the German Colonies.&apos; The Vossische Zeitung doubts the correctness of the report, and adds,, however, at the same time, that all preliminary agreements between the Entente are without any value as affecting the decision of the Peace Conference because the German representatives, it is to be hoped, will never sign a dictated peace. Germany made her armistice offer on the condition that a peace of justice on the principle of the Wilsonian points should be concluded. The Social Democratic Vonvaerts writes briefly and clearly : &apos; One must say, the League of Nations starts well ! The decision of the Western Powers to annex the German Colonies is born from a spirit which is in opposition to the guiding principles announced by President Wilson.&apos; &quot;German AYireless of January 30th stated : &quot; During the last few claj-s the foreign Press has been receiving numerous reports from Paris regarding the intentions of the Allies with regard to the German colonies. Although these reports are not at all of an official character, they nevertheless allow one to.conclude with a certain degree of confidence that the leading British and French statesmen entertain the intention of preventing the restitution to Germany of her colonial rights. As opposed to this the German Imperial Government points out that the Wilsonian proposals for the settlement of colonial questions were also accepted by the Allies without restrictions. The plans which are being formulated to exclude Germany from the possession of colonial territories are not only in the most flagrant opposition to the Wilsonian peace programme, but they awaken within the German people, who expected from their opponents a peace of justice, a feeling of the deepest bitterness. There is no-justification for the exclusion of Germany from colonial possessions.&quot;LIBERIA.Status of Republic : Action regarding Cable. The Foreign Office have received information to the effect that the ex-German cable is not yet joined to the cables of the South American Cable Company, as the Liberian Government refuse to allow anyone to use the German cable pending the decision of the Peace Conference as to the status of Liberia.
