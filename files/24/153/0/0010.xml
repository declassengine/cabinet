SECRET.APPRECIATION  OF THE ATTACHED REPORT No. 104.BRITISH  EMPIRE  AND AFRICA.Imperial Affairs.It is clear that the representation accorded to New Zealand and Newfoundland at the Peace Conference is by no means satisfactory to those Dominions.-&apos;The representation of the Dominions upon the International Commissions dealing with - &quot;various asj^ects of Peace problems will enable them to exercise very direct influence upon the issues involved.At the meetings of Allied and Associated Ministers a strong effort is being made by the representatives of the British Empire to secure that Gorman territory adjacent to the Dominions, which has been captured by them, such as the Colonies in New Guinea and South-West Africa, should be treated as conquered by the Dominions, and not be placed under the mandatory of the League of Nations. (See also under &quot;Australia,&quot; &quot;New Zealand,&quot; and &quot;South Africa.&quot;)Canada.The Report of the Department of Labour contemplates a period of exceptional prosperity for the Dominion directly a sufficient supply of labour justifies the expansion of manufacturing activity.The Liberal Party is proceeding with reorganisation, and further lines of policy have been indicated.Idie attitude of the Quebec clergy to compulsory education is of political importance.The Labour threats of a general strike and the reception recently accorded the President of the Trades and Labour Congress at Toronto are indicative of a reckless and irresponsible element attempting to gain the upper hand.Australian Commonwealtii.There is no question that Commonwealth feeling is strongly against the applica-tion of the mandatory principle to captured territory in New Guinea. It is clear that Australian-statesmen would find it difficult to justify in Parliament any expenditure upon territory which was not to be under the complete control of the Commonwealth.The Australian proposals for the pooling of war debts and the establishment of an Empire War Debts Commission to take over the war debts of the Empire, are of interest and importance.It.is satisfactory to note that the Deputy Leader of the Official Labour Party has made an emphatic pronouncement dissociating his party from the extremists of the I.W.W. persuasion.

BRITISH  EMPIRE   AND   AFRICA  REPORT.IMPERIAL AFFAIRS.British Empire Delegation: Representation of Dominions. Amongst the matters dealt with at the meeting of the British Empire Delegation in Paris on January 23rd was the confirmation of Lord Robert Cecil and General Smuts as representatives of the Delegation on the Commission dealing with the League of Nations. It was also decided that Mr. Hughes, Lord Simmer and Lord cunliffe should be the representatives of the British Empire on the Commission dealing with Reparation, it having been proposed that each of the five Allied Powers should appoint not more than three representatives on this Commission. For the Commission on International Ports, Waterways and Railways, it was agreed that Air. Sifton should be one of the representatives.Amongst-other matters discussed by the Delegation was the representation of Dominion interests. In the ^course of this discussion the Prime Minister of New Zealand (Mr. Massey) raised the question of the representation of his Dominion, stating that the decision to give New Zealand only one delegate was very unsatisfactory in view of the great efforts and sacrifices made by the Dominion in the war: He, however, held the delegates of the British Government blameless in the matter. The position of Newfoundland was also raised, and it was explained that the question of separate representation for the different parts of the British Empire was not thoroughly understood in the United States. The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom (Mr. Lloyd George), in reply to a question by Mr. Massey as to whether the matter could be reconsidered, said that there was no chance of this being done unless the representation of all Powers was to be reconsidered. He pointed out that there would be opportunities for New Zealand to be represented on the Delegation of five representatives of the British Empire.Meetings of Allied and Associated Ministers: Question of German Colonies.  The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs informed the War Cabinet by telegram on January 24th that at the meeting of the Allied and Associated Ministers that afternoon, it was unanimously agreed that the German Colonies should not be restored to Germany. The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom (Mr. Lloyd George) urged that the Dominions should be permitted to treat conquered territories as iheir own and that such territories should not be put under European control. The Prime Minister of the Australian Commonwealth (Mr. Hughes) claimed that Australia should retain the islands she had conquered in the Pacific. The South African Minister of Defence (General Smuts) put forward a similar claim in regard to German South-West Africa, and the Prime Minister of New Zealand urged the retention of Samoa by New Zealand. The Prime Minister of Canada (Sir Robert Borden) expressed general sympathy with the above suggestions.Telegraphing on January 28th the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs stated that at a meeting of Allied and Associated Ministers held that morning the question of German Colonies was again discussed. The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. (Mr. Lloyd George) argued that the Colonies conquered by the Dominions should be treated specially and not placed under the mandatory of the League of Nations. The Prime Minister of New Zealand (Mr. Massey) again urged that Samoa should be given to his Dominion.SELF-GOVERNING   DOMINIONS.CANADA.Transference to Peace Footing: Trade Position. Following a comprehensive investigation in the various Provinces of the Dominion, the Department&apos; of Labour has issued a statement to the effect that the task of replacing Canada on a peace
footing, so far at least as manufacturers are concerned, will be accompli shed witlr little confusion, and it is hoped a period of exceptional prosperity and activity lies before the country. The Department states that the Dominion is entering upon a period of expansion greater than at any time in her history. There is no anxiety so far as the attitude of the manufacturers is concerned, as they are quite alive to the opportunities offering, and are only awaiting a sufficient supply of labour to institute large measures of expansion. The Department further states that no sudden readjustment of wages is expected, and that general stability with slow and steady development to meet the new conditions is the evident tendency throughout Canada.Reorganisation of Liberal Party : Points of Policy. It is announced that as part of the reorganisation of the Liberal Party, a Central Association, with headquarters at Toronto, has been formed. The Liberal Convention adopted Resolutions declaring in favour of equality of pensions for soldiers and sailors and the abolition of honorary military titles, of the abolition of appeals to the Privy Council, and of an investigation into the affairs of the Canadian Northern Railway, to discover who benefited, directly or indirectly, by the sale and purchase of this railway and the names of those who dealt in its London securities, Mr. Graham, former Minister of Railways; argued at the Convention that the tariff could be revised downward without injury to any manufacturing concern which ought to live in Canada. Sir Wilfrid Laurier, he said, wanted the reunion of the Liberal Parry and the support of every man and woman who believed in Liberal principles.Premier of Quebec and Mayor of Montreal. The Premier of Quebec (Sir Lomer Qouin) has been strongly attacked in the Provincial Legislature by the Leader of the Opposition and other Liberals for appointing the Mayor of Montreal (Mr. Martin) to a seat in the Legislative Council. It is alleged that owing to Mr. Martin having attempted to discredit both Houses of the Legislature, he should have been made to appear in the. Courts rather than presented with a seat in the Legislative Council.Quebec Clergy and Compulsory Education. Dealing with the movement for com-pulsory education Cardinal Begin, in L&apos;Action Gatholigue, declares that the population of Quebec does not need the whip to travel towards progress. Nothing, he declares, would justify the State in imposing upon parents compulsory education, which in many countries is closely associated with religious neutrality. The Cardinal holds the view that the responsibility of education rests on the family and not on the State. It is reported that the Roman Catholic clergy of Quebec Province and Laval University are also opposing the proposal.Labour and Threats of General Strike. It is reported that at a largely attended labour meeting at Toronto last week a considerable proportion of those j)resent were Russian and Austrian Jews and Socialists. The object of the meeting was to protest against Orders in Council which curtailed the freedom of the Press or speech, and a resolution to that effect was adopted. The President of the Trades and Labour Congress (Mr. Tom Moore), who had difficulty in securing a hearing, protested against the talk of a general strike unless the Orders in Council were repealed.At a meeting in Montreal, attended by 15,000 people, a resolution was adopted for a 30-hour working week to provide all round employment, and if refused a general strike to be ordered.Reconstruction and Soldiers&apos; Settlement. The Dominion Minister of the Interior (Mr. Meighen), outlining the reconstruction programme of the Government in an address at Winnipeg last week, declared that returned soldiers were to be given every chance to make gOod and to improve their former positions in civilian life on their return to Canada.Explaining the working of the Soldier Settlement Act, the Minister stated that all available Government-owned land within 15 miles of a railway had been reserved, and that the Government Avould ask Parliament for authority to acquire privately-owned land either by purchase or expropriation. Up to date 814 free entries to Dominion land had been granted, and 1,065 loans, aggregating over S 1,385,000, advanced.&apos; The Minister reviewed the work of the military hospitals and the Invalided Soldiers Commission, stating that 150 institutions were being administered at the present time by the Medical Services Branch.
Mr.Meighen declared that free medical service for those afflicted in the war -would continue as long as the last veteran lived. He stated also that the results obtained from the vocational training of the returned men had been very gratifying. More than 7,000 men have already been approved for specific lines of work, and over 2,000 had graduated in training courses and had been placed in civil employment.Seventy per cent, of those who took courses had been successfully placed in occupations for which they had trained under the Government seheme, and less than 5 per cent, had turned out failures.North American Indians.  The Department of Indian Affairs reports that there are now living in Canada 109,294 Indians, including 3,296 Eskimos, and the Indian population is slowly but steadily increasing. During the war 3,500 Indians enlisted, approximately 35 per cent, of the male Indians of military age in the nine provinces.. Sales of Canadian Securities. The Minister of Immigration and Colonisation reports that a further indication as to how the war has taught Canada to stand on her own. feet financially is disclosed hy the fact that out of the total sales of Canadian securities issued during 19.18, approximating $764,000,000, the Dominion absorbed nearly 95 per cent, of the total. Less than $40,000,000, or, in other words, slightly over 5 per cent., were issued in the United States and Great Britain, of which the latter took only a little over $3,000,000. Previous to the war by far the greater part of Canadian Government and municipal securities were sold abroad.AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH.Control of Pacific Islands. An important statement signed by the Acting Prime Minister (Mr. Watt) has been forwarded to Mr. Hughes&apos;on behalf of the Common-wealth Government outlining the position with regard to the Pacific Islands. Mr. Hughes has expressed himself publicly as in wholediearted agreement with the statement, which is as follows : &quot; The Commonwealth Government, having noted the report of the consideration by the Peace Conference of the question of the disposal of Germany&apos;s former oversea dominions, desires to state that, equally with its strong opinion against the restoration to Germany of the islands in the Pacific,&apos;in which Australia is especially interested, it expresses emphatic objections to any form of international government of these islands.&quot; It is the desire and hope of the Australian authorities that those islands should for the future be controlled either by Britain or by Australia. In this we are not influenced by any ambition of extended territory, but we feel that this free young nation must safeguard itself against molestation in the future, and that the only form of insurance open to us is a Government under the British flag.&quot; As the Commonwealth already governs a substantial area in Oceania adjacent to the late German New Guinea and the Bismarck Archipelago, the Government feels that the success that has attended its development of these islands must appeal to nations which have to judge A.australia&apos;s claims. Australia&apos;s aims are not the exploitation of natives, but the development of the productive and industrial possibilities of these possessions for the future good of the present inhabitants, as wrell as the safety of the Commonwealth.&quot; The Government feels strongly, after considering carefully the prospects of the I internationalisation and neutralisation of Germany&apos;s late possessions in the Pacific, as well as of other countries that formerly belonged to her, that nothing but complica-tions will arise out of that method of control. Many evidences have been tendered to the Government that this is the practically unanimous view of the people of Australia, who, with the Commonwealth Government, earnestly trust that Australia will be given I an opportunity of safeguarding its future beyond doubt, and proving its capacity to administer this great trust in the interests of humanity, as well as of the people of the Com monw ealth.Japan and the Pacific Islands. The Melbourne evening papers published last wreek a cable from a special representative in Paris, stating that considerable agitation had been aroused in certain quarters by the outspoken statement of Mr. Hughes in an
interview with an American paper to the following effect&apos;:-&quot;If I do not get fair treatment concerning the Pacific Islands, I will not hesitate to -appeal to public opinion in the Allied countries. The Japanese are highly intelligent people, but their ways are not our ways, and we would regard with suspicion any geographical adA&apos;ance by Japan towards Australia.&quot;The Acting Prime Minister, Mr. Watt, interviewed on the subject, expressed a doubt whether Mr. Hughes made the statement as reported, and stated that he believed Mr. Hughes was satisfied that the question of the destination and future control of the Pacific Islands would be fairly dealt with by the Peace representatives, and that Australia&apos;s claim would be successfully supported. Mr. Watt said he could not credit Mr. Hughes making &quot;statements of a contingent kind which might excite antipathy towards Japan.Pooling of War Debts. The Acting Prime Minister of the Commonwealth (Mr. Watt) has brought before the Conference of Australian Premiers now sitting in Melbourne a proposal for the appointment of an Empire &quot;War-Debts Commission, to take over the war debts of the Empire.Mr. Watt said that the Avar had established &quot;our close relationship with our kin overseas.&quot; - He believed that a pooling of the financial effort was now practicable and desirable. One might say it was the duty of the seA^eral parts of the Empire to carry together the financial load of the war, as they had united in the actual war.The proposed combination would be powerful beyond anything that had previously existed &quot;in the financial world, and would save millions to the Empire. The details of the proposal were as follows : ^(a) That an Empire War-Debts Commission be created.(6) That this Commission take over the war debts of the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, India, South Africa and other portions of the Empire.(c) That each Government should have representation on the Commission on anassigned basis, either of the amount of Avar debt per capita, or of popula-tion, or of something agreeable to all parties.(d) That all debts at the 31st December 1919 be taken over, and all sinkingfunds and redemption funds then existing be vested in the Commission.(e) That interest and principal moneys falling due after the elate named be- paidby the Commission.(/) That the debts be converted into one large stock as and when they mature; the Commission to have discretion to establish more than one common stock, and to convert loans before maturity.(g) All terms and conditions of issues of common stock or stocks to be determined by the Commission. .(//) Each Government to pay to the Commission a fixed annuity equal to the yearly amount payable by the Government at the 31st December 1919 in respect of interest; also, the expenses of paying interests and;contributions towards redemption of the debt. . That this annuity be paid in such instalments as may be desired by the Commission, and shall run on until the debts handed over, including debts converted into common stock, haA^e been repaid to the public creditors.(/) If at any time the annuity should not be sufficient to cover five shillings on every 100L of debt taken over, in addition to the interest and expenses then actually payable on such debt, including the debt converted into common stock, the Government concerned to make good the deficiency by a payment to the Commission in addition to the annuity.(j) The amount of payments made by a Government to the Commission in excess of what is paid by the Commission for interest and expenses on the debts taken over from that Government, including debts converted into common srock, to be treated as payments towards the redemption of the principal.(fc) That the Commission should keep account of the obligations of each Government, charging and discharging it both in respect of principal and interest. For this purpose the Commission should haA&quot;e power to decide how much of the common stock is chargeable to each Government, and how much of the earnings-of general investments should be credited to each.(/)&apos; That any additional loans necessary in consequence of the war should be raised by the Commission.71S5 oa B
Proceeding, Mr. Watt said that the full control of all war debts and of their conversion into a common stock would be undertaken by the Commission, which, out of the monies paid by the several Governments, would in time fully pay off the debts. The scheme contemplates a sinking fund of at least one-quarter per cent, to pay off the whole debt in 72 years at the latest. In some cases the sinking fund, would be more than 5s. for each 100LThe considerable reduction of interest which would probably be effected by the Commission would also go towards the repayment of the principal, so that the extinction of the debt would occur long before the expiration of the 72 years.The Commission would have a discretion to raise loans in foreign countries as well as in Great Britain and the Dominions. In this waj- the field for borrowing would be enlarged, and money would be obtained always in the cheapest market. The Mother country herself would gain, Mr. Watt declared, by joining in this great Empire effort. The appropriation of revenue for monies to be paid by the Commission would be passed by each Government. As an additional safeguard, the laws of several of the Dominions might be fortified by enactments of the British Parliament.The Commonwealth Government propose to take an early opportunity of making the necessary representations to the Governments concerned.Federal and State Conference : Soldier Settlement, ccc. A Conference comprising 24 Federal and State Ministers has -been opened in Melbourne to consider a scheme for the repatriation and settlement in Australia of soldiers of the British Army, the wheat position, the financial relations between the Commonwealth and the States, the co-ordination of public borrowing, and the question of uniform taxation laws. The Acting Prime Minister of the Commonwealth (Mr. Watt) presided and said they all desired the soldiers to return as rapidly as possible, but without co-ordination between the various Governments difficulties were likely to arise regarding settlement and employment. The Federal Government had, he said, decided to invite all the States&apos; jGovernments to &quot;study the financial and works programmes. Theinaiu repatriation pressure would be probably, he said, 12months after the signing of peace.Senator Milieu explained the repatriation prsition. 70,000 soldiers had returned, and 30,000 were on the way, leaving 167,000 unembarked. It was estimated that 10 per cent, of the returned soldiers would settle on the land, on approximately 20,000 holdings. A settler required 1.50.0L to start with, involving an expenditure of 30,00O,000L, but he hoped to devise rural settlements involving less expenditure.International Labour Conference. The Australian Labour Party has appointed Messrs. Anstey and Ryan as representatives at the International Labour Conference.Labour Party and I.W.W. The Deputy header of the Official Labour Party (Mr. Higgs) has denounced the methods of the I. WAV. He said that the majority of working class people wanted to live decent lives, but a few cunning extremists who lacked responsibility, thought to bring about the millennium by force. Mr. Biggs warned them that if they could not get reforms by the ballot box, they could not get them by bullets, or by the destruction of machinery.NEW ZEALAND.Representation at the Peace Conference. For information under this head, see under &quot;Imperial Affairs &quot; (vide also Report No. 103).SOUTH AFRICA.Control of Soidli-West Africa.-The attitude adopted at the Paris meetings by the representatives of the Union is indicated under &quot; Imperial Affairs.&quot;&apos; Union Parliament and loyalty.-. The Acting Prime Minister (Mr. Malan) moved a Resolution in the House of Assembly soon after the meeting of Parliament, expressing gratitude to Almighty God for being able once more to assemble under
peaceful conditions; sincere congratulations to His Majesty the King upon the victory which had been achieved ; fervent hopes that the enormous sacrifices, which had been made in the cause of freedom would ensure the lasting peace of the world; and sympathy with the peoples of the British Empire and their Allies and Associates in war in the sufferings endured by them.The Leader of the Opposition (Sir Thomas Smartt) seconded the resolution, and said, &quot;The sympathies of every section of the community go forward to the King, Avho has lived in the hearts of his people at a time when thrones and kingdoms were tumbling to the ground.&quot;Mr. Tielman Roos^ Nationalist, moved an amendment to add after the words &quot;peace of the world &quot; the sentence &quot;which can only be attained by the complete application of the principles regarding the restoration of the rights, liberties, and right of self-determination of nations as clearly enunciated by the Allies and the Associated Powers.&quot; Mr. Roos&apos;s amendment was rejected by 73 votes to 20, and the motion was adopted. . V.   &apos;Mr. Malan then moved a further resolution, thanking the citizens of the Onion, combatant and non-combatant, who /had served in the war, &quot; who by their-conduct had helped to create a common pride in a great South African achievement.&quot; , Mr. Malan gave figures showing that 60,000 men went to German. South-West Africa, 31,000 overseas, and 41,500 to Central and East Africa a considerable achievement, considering the smallness of the white population of the Union. The total casualties suffered in all the campaigns was 7,089. .:Sir Thomas Smartt seconded the resolution, Avhich was adopted unanimously., .Identical Resolutions Avere passed by the Senate, and a Nationalist amendment on the same lines as that moved in the Lower House Avas defeated hy 20 votes to 3.Nationalist Congress. The Nationalist Congress concluded Avith a Resolution inviting all who were Republican-minded, especially those of the South African Party, to co-oioerate in. the Independence movement. A Resolution AA-as also passed -protesting against the persecution of Germans in South Africa. An appeal Avas made for more funds for the purpose of sending the &quot;Mission to Europe, as it Avas announced that the sum collected Avas insufficient.South- African, Party and the Nationalists. The first to repudiate the Bloem-fontein Nationalist resolutions Avas the executive of the South African Party on the WitAvatersrand, which at a special meeting passed a resolution expressing grave disapproval of the Republican propaganda started by the Nationalists at the Bloem-fontein Congress. The Executive considers the proposed action extremely dangerous and fraught with disaster for the Union and Avarns all South African Party branches against this propaganda and expresses adherence to the constitution of the Union and confidence in General Botha and the Ministry.Dr. Malan in Parliament. In the by-election at Calvinia (Cape Province) to fill a vacancy in the House of Assembly, Dr. Malan, the leader of the Nationalists in the Cape Province, received 1,568 votes against 1,080 polled by his opponent, Mr. Strauss of the South African Party. The seat was formerly held by Mr. W. P. Louw (Nationalist).Appointment of British Ministers : Position of Union Government. In reply to a question in the Senate asking for the opinion of the Union GoA-ernment as to the appointment of Lord Milner as Secretary of State of the Colonies, the Acting Prime Minister said that the Government considered it as inadvisable for them to express an opinion in regard to the appointment of a Minister to the British Cabinet, as it would be for the British Government to express an opinion in regard to the appointment of a Minister of the Union.In a further question as to Avhether communications between the Union and Imperial Governments Avere still carried on through the Governor-General and Colonial Office, the Acting Prime Minister stated : &quot; Yes ; except that under the resolution recently adopted by the Imperial War Cabinet the Prime Minister of each Dominion has the right, if he so desires, in regard to any particular question, of direct communication Avith the British Prime Minister.&quot;The Union and Delagoa Bay. -A question appeared in the paper of the Union House of Assembly last week in the name of one of the Natal Members (Colonel
INDIA.(Excluding External Affairs, which are dealt with in the Eastern Report.)Food Prices. The poorer classes are stated to be feeling acutely the high prices of foodstuffs, and the agricultural position in Northern India has been made worse by the absence of winter rains. Apprehension has been, however, allayed to some extent by the action of the Government in appointing a Foodstuffs Commissioner. Another feature which is said to be helping to minimise the difficulties of - the position is the promise of wheat supplies from Australia, while the maintenance of Indian crops for local consumption has been effected by the prohibition of grain exports. Suggestions have been made in the Press that maize might be obtained from South Africa.Bombay Strike. In Bombay the strike spread from mill hands to the Government dockyard and the Peninsular and Oriental and British India employes. The Governor postponed an intended visit to Delhi for a conference with other heads of Provinces on the Reform Scheme, and interviewed representatives of the millowners and of the operatives. The owners decided to form a committee to consider sympathetically all complaints when the men returned to work. The mill hands did return to -work on January 25th in large numbers, and it is hoped their strike is over.Legislation on Sedition Committee Report. Two BiUs have been drafted, and will probably have been published in India by this time, to give effect to-the recommendations of this Committee. The first embodies changes in the regular criminal law. It makes the offence of possession of seditious documents (except for a lawful purpose) punishable with imprisonment for two years, or fine, or both. It empowers a magistrate to order an inspector or superior officer of police to investigate a charge of an offence against the State or of criminal conspiracy. It explains that a Court is not &quot;using influence&quot; to induce an accused person to disclose his knowledge if it promises him protection from violence. It aUows, under conditions, the proof against a person accused of an jDffenee against the State of a previous conviction for such an offence, or of association with persons so convicted. It gives power to the Court convicting of such an offence to require bonds for good behaviour, and notification to a specified officer of residence and change, of residence after release; and to the Government to impose upon the released person limitations of movement, locality of residence, and a prohibition of public speaking likely to cause disturbance, and of the distribution of political literature.Silburn) asking in &quot; the vital interests of Natal&quot; as secured by the&apos;.Mozambique Treaty : &quot; Whether there is is any foundation in fact for the report that General Botha and Sir William Hoy are using their best endeavours while in Europe to secure the inclusion as an integral part of the Union of a portion of Portuguese East Africa, including Delagoa Bay? &quot;The question was subsequently withdrawn.Financial Position. The Treasurer is asking Parliament for 1,500,000L in addition to the original estimates for the current year. Though the large increases in Bank deposits are referred to as a satisfactory feature of South Africans financial position, the additional war bonus involves an unforeseen outlay of 530,000L, and the recent influenza epidemic will cost the Central Government&quot; 200,000L There are other large items, such as additional provision for the Provincial Administrations, also due to the war bonus. The Customs revenue, however, has largely exceeded the estimates, and the Treasury, with the additional appropriation, hopes to emerge with only a nominal deficit.Opposition criticism, expressed by Sir Edgar Walton and Mr. Jagger, took the line that the inevitable increases in expenditure ought to have been met in part by economies in Administration.
The second Bill contains provisions to supplement the ordinary criminal law in -times of emergency. It contemplates three grades of emergency: (i). the prevalence of certain scheduled offences (armed riots, murder, grievous hurt, dacoity, &amp;c., if connected with any political movements endangering the safety, of the State) and the necessity of speedy trial of them ; (ii) the extensive promotion of movements likely to lead to the commission of offences against the State ; (in) the commission of offences against the State to such an extent as seriously to endanger the public safety. . In the first emergency a special tribunal consisting of three judges of the High Court is established, which will try the accused upon indictment presented direct to that Court, but otherwise according to the regular procedure, with safeguards designed to secure to the accused (in the absence of the usual magistrate^ inquiry and formal charge) a full opportunity for his defence. The Court&apos;s decision is not liable to appeal, and requires no confirmation (as is customary with sentences of death).In the second emergency the Government is given powers to demand from any person actively concerned in the movement, a bond for good behaviour, notification of residence, residence in a defined area, abstinence from specified acts, and regular report of himself to the police. The propriety of any such demand has to be examined by an &quot;investigating authority,&quot; which may hear the person concerned, and report to the Government. The Government passes final orders which hold good for one year, but may be renewed. The &quot; investigating authority &quot; consists of three persons, one being a Judge, and one a non-official. A Visiting Committee for persons under restriction must also be appointed.In the third emergency the Government may order the arrest, without warrant, and confinement of any person concerned in an offence against the State, and the search of any place being used for purposes prejudicial to the public safety. Subsequent procedure is as described for action under the second emergency.There is also a general provision that persons subjected to restrictions under the Defence of India Rules, shall, when those rules expire six months after the war ends, he deemed to fall under the new Jaw.
