SECRET.APPRECIATION OF THE ATTACHED REPORT No. 134.BRITISH EMPIRE  AND AFRICA.Imperial Affairs.The Governments of Canada, the Australian Commonwealth, and New Zealand all favour the suggested method of obtaining Parliamentary approval of the Peace Treaty by way of Resolution of both Houses.Though some time may elapse before any mandate can be formally conferred upon a Dominion Government in regard to captured territory in Africa or the Pacific, the South African Government will be able to announce to Parliament next month that, in accordance with the agreement arrived at by the Special Commission on Mandates, the Union will have full power of legislation and administration over South-West Africa as an integral portion of South Africa.Attention is called to the telegram to Canada regarding Imperial News Service.Canada.It is interesting to note that the Financial Director in the Secretariat of the League of Nations will retain his seat in the Dominion House of Commons. The aimual vote towards the expenses of the Permanent Secretariat will afford the Dominion Parliament an opportunity of reviewing the work of the League, and of discussing and obtaining information upon international affairs.The new liberal Leader will apparently not be provided with a seat in the House of Commons in time to enable him to take part in the proceedings of the - Special Session which open next week.The exchange situation seems to have been the deciding factor against floating the new loan in the United States.The suggested arrangements for the transfer of Canadian-owned ships to the Dominion register will no doubt go far to meet the dissatisfaction recently existing. The Committee on Sea Communications will be able to see that satisfactory future arrangements are concluded.Australian Commonwealth.It is a little surprising that Parliament, being already in session, cannot consider the Peace Treaty before September 10th.Steps are being taken to meet the serious position arising from the lack of shipping for meat exports. [p.t.o.
The seamen&quot;s strike has happily terminated, though it is to be feared that incalculable loss has already been suffered by the commercial community. .The Amending Immigration Bill prevents the entry of Germans and other ex-enemies into the Oommonwealth for a minimum period of five years.New Zealand.The National Government, formed for war purposes, is at an end, and Sir Joseph Ward has left the Coalition Government with all his Liberal colleagues. The Liberal programme outlined by Sir Joseph is likely to appeal to the smaller farmers and to moderate labour.   The references to naval defence are of interest.The British Board of Trade are endeavouring to deal with the problem arising from the accumulation of meat awaiting shipment in the Dominion.South Africa.The death of General Botha in the present situation of South African politics is a loss of serious magnitude to the Empire. How great the loss will prove it is impossible at the moment to estimate, but the effect upon the political situation in the Union will be immediate and profound.     ,Being unable at present to send a Minister to Europe, the Union Government have asked Lord Milner to sign the Austrian and subsecpient Treaties on behalf of South Africa.The Resolution adopted by the South African Party Congress emphasises that any reunion with the Nationalists must be based upon the maintenance of the Act of Union. At the same time, the declaration made by General Botha just before his death showed that the South African Party, short of sacrificing their principles, would go far&quot;towards effecting a reunion of the Dutch elements of the population.India.The crop prospects appear to be satisfactory.H. d&apos;EAugust 28th, 1919.

BRITISH   EMPIRE   AND   AFRICA  REPORT.IMPERIAL AFFAIRS.Ratification of Peace Treaty. See under &quot; Canada,&quot; &quot; Australian Commonwealth,&quot; and &quot; New Zealand.&quot;Form of Mandate. The Secretary of State for the Colonies telegraphed to the Governments of the Australian Commonwealth, Union of South Africa and Dominion of New Zealand on July 18th stating that the Special Commission on Mandates, appointed hy the Council of the principal Allied and Associated Governments on June 26th, had agreed on the form of mandate for territories to he governed in accordance with para. 6 of Art. 22 of the Covenant of the League of Nations, viz., South-West Africa and the former German Pacific Colonies. This form gave full power of administration and legislation over the territory as an integral portion of the territory of the mandatory Power, and the latter could apply its laws subject to such local modifications as circumstances might require. The mandatory Power at the same time had to undertake to prohibit the slave trade and not to permit forced labour except for essential public works and services and then only for adequate remuneration. The mandatory Power had also to control the traffic in arms and ammunition in accordance with the principles of the Brussels Act, 1890, or any Convention amending it, to prohibit the supply of intoxicating spirits and beverages to the natives of the territory, to prohibit the military training of the natives otherwise than for purposes of internal police and local defence, to undertake not to establish military or naval bases or fortifications, to allow missionaries who are subjects of any member of the League to enter and reside in the territory for the purpose of prosecuting their calling, and to make to the Councd of the League an Annual Report. The consent of the Council of the League was to be required for any modification of the terms of the mandate.Referring to the above-mentioned telegram, the South African Ministers tele-graphed on August 15th stating that it was imperative that the necessary powers Avhereby the administration of South-West Africa would be conferred on the Union Government should be in their hands by September 5th, and they requested therefore that the passing- of the mandate could be expedited so that it could be laid before Parliament.In reply the Secretary of State for the Colonies telegraphed on August 19th that he saw no prospect of any mandate being conferred by the date mentioned, but that he saw no objection to the substance of the form of mandate telegraphed on July 18th being communicated to the Union Parliament, emphasis: being laid on the provision that the Union should have full power of legislation and administration over South-West Africa as an integral portion of South Africa.Imperial News Service. With reference to the paragraph under this, heading Appearing in Report No. 133, it should have been stated that a telegram was also sent to the Canadian Government calling attention to the fact that there was no news service on any considerable scale supplied to Canada from British sources before the war [see 5th Interim Report, Dominions Royal Commission, Cd. 8457, pp. 38-40, and discussions on Imperial News Service, Imperial War Conference, 1918), and that since 1917 arrangements had been in force whereby Reuters instituted a general news service from London to Canada. Recently, the message continued, negotiations had been proceeding with a view to the continuance of this service for one year from October 1st, 1919, on similar lines to the 1917 arrangement, and Reuters had proposed a scheme whereby a general news service of 25,000 words per month would be sent to Canada on Government account. The British Government intimated their willingness to bear half the cost of the proposed service for one year from October 1st, and enquired whether the Dominion Government would bear the other half.
SELF-GOVERNING   DOMINIONS.CANADA.Ratification of Peace Treaty: Parliamentary Approval.-With reference to the suggestion of the British Government as to the method of obtaining&apos; -Parliamentary approval of the Peace Treaty (vide Report No. 133, under &quot; Imperial Affairs &quot;), the Dominion Government have telegraphed that they propose to proceed by way of Resolution of both Houses in order to expedite matters. Legislation to give effect to the Treaty wiU be introduced later.,Financial Director of the League of Nations: Seat in Parliament.-With reference to the appointment of Sir Herbert Ames, M.P., as Financial Director to the Secretariat of the.League of Nations (vide Report No. 132), it. has been decided that Sir Herbert shall retain his seat in the Dominion House of Commons, for the present at least, as it has seemed desirable that someone who will have intimate knowledge of the workings of the League organisation should be able to return to Canada from time to time and speak in the House of Commons when Canada&apos;s annual contribution towards the expenses of the Permanent Secretariat will come before Parliament for approval.Liberal Leadership.-Mx. D. I). Mackenzie will continue to lead the Liberal Party in the House of Commons- until a seat is found for the newly chosen leader, Mr. McKenzie Ring.New Loan. The Dominion Government have floated a new domestic loan for $300,000,000 (60,000,000L), having abandoned the idea of floating a loan in the United States owing to the exchange situation.Canadian-owned Ships: Dissatisfaction in Dominion. In reply to the telegram from the Prime Minister of the Dominion (Sir Robert Borden) -as to the dissatisfaction existing with regard to ships owned in Canada but registered in the United Kingdom (vide Report No. 132), the British Government have telegraphed that they are inost anxious to meet the wishes of the Dominion Government, and propose that, subject to adequate safeguards for the maintenance of present rights in regard to the carriage of Government cargo by liners, all ships that were Canadian owned before the war, and any ships transferred to Canadian owners during the war, should now, if their owners I desire it, be transferred to the Canadian register. The hope is expressed that the Committee which is to enquire into the whole subject of sea communications will lead to the establishment of- more satisfactory conditions in the future. The case of the-Bilbster is fully explained in this telegram.Price of Wheat.-The Canadian Wheat Board has fixed the sale price of wheat to mills at $2.33 to $2.25 per bushel, according to grade, with 5 cents a bushel for carrying charges.Citizens&apos; Committee at Winnipeg. At a mass meeting of the citizens of Winnipeg it was resolved to establish a permanent Citizens&apos; Committee to succeed the Committee of One Thousand which was organised during the recent strike. The Committee will be an active agent in municipal affairs.AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTB.Parliament and Peace Treaty. With reference to the enquiry of the British Government as to the earliest date on which the formal assent of the Commonwealth Parliament to the ratification of the Peace Treaty may be expected, the Common-wealth Government have telegraphed, that Parliament is being summoned for September 10th for the special consideration of the Peace Treaty. It is stated to have been impossible to arrange the meeting before that date, and that it is difficult at this stage to predict the time required for passage through both Houses. The Government, however, undertake to show the utmost despatch.With regard to the suggested mode of procedure (vide Report No. 133 uuder Imperial Affairs &quot;), the Commonwealth Government agree that a Resolution is the.S709-4a A 2
preferable course, but opportunity will be taken of consulting the Prime Minister (Mr. Hughes) on his arrival before communicating a final decision.Arrival &quot; of Prime Minister. A telegram from Perth, dated August 23rd announced that the Prime Minister (Mr. Hughes) and the Minister for the Royal Australian Navy (Sir Joseph Cook) had arrived at Perth ancl were given an enthusiastic reception.     .ySerious Position of Meat Export Trade. In reply to the telegram from the Commonwealth Government regarding the serious position of the meat export trade owing to lack of shipping accommodation (vide Report No. 133), the British Govern-ment have telegraphed that steamers are expected to sail from Australia durino-August and September having an insulated capacity of 5,470,000 cubic feet. It is pointed out that in view of the meat requirements of the United Kingdom and the Allies it is not possible to divert large numbers of steamers from the shorter to the longer routes, but that two meat-carrying vessels are being diverted from South American to Australasian trade and the possibility of diverting others will be carefullv considered. Special attention, it is added, is being given in order to assist Australia in view of the unexpectedly early and abundant season in the Southern States. The British Government express the hope that the Commonwealth Ministers will appreciate that the difficulty of relieving congestion has been largely increased through the influenza epidemic and labour troubles in Australia.Seamen&apos;s Strike. The seamen&apos;s strike is now at an end. It was reported on August 23rd that the men had accepted the GovernmenPs terms of settlement, ancl had agreed to man the ships at once.Aliens and Immigration Bill.

With reference to the suggestion of the British Government as to the method of obtaining Parliamentary approval of the&apos; Peace Treaty (vide Report No. 133, under &quot;Imperial Affairs &quot;), the Prime Minister of the Dominion has agreed to submit the Treaty to Parliament by Resolution.   He expects to be able to do this on September 2nd.End af National Government. It is announced in the Press that Sir Joseph Ward ancl the other Liberal Ministers who joined with Mr. Massey in the formation or the National Government have now all tendered their resignations ancl the Coalition Government is thus at an end. Sir Joseph Ward has published a manifesto outlining his future policj^. He says that after much thought and with the full concurrence of his Liberal colleagues in the Cabinet he has decided that his continuance in the Administration, which had naturally no cohesion on any fixed principle save that of winning the war, was not in the best interests of the.- country. The Liberal programme includes the establishment of a State Bank, the nationalisation of coal mines and flour mills, the continuance ancl expansion of Imperial Preference, with additional duties on imports from countries not members of the League of Nations, proportional representation for city and suburban electorates, with extensions as the growth of - population justifies, also vigorous land settlement, railway construction, and restrictions on profiteering. The country should not, Sir Joseph says, undertake any share in a local Navy, but should support a suitable scheme for protection in the Pacific.Meat aioaiting Shipment:&apos; Serious Posit reply to the telegram from theNew Zealand Government as to the serious position arising from the accumulation of meat awaiting shipment (vide Report No. 133), the British Government have telegraphed that the Board of Trade appreciate the serious position and are doing their utmost to provide tonnage. Their efforts, it is stated, have been greatly hampered by circumstances beyond their control, such as the influenza epidemic and labour troubles and, more recently, the coal shortage in New Zealand.

The Congress of the South African Party in the Free State on August 22nd passed a resolution declaring that any reunion of the party with the Nationalists must be made conditional on the vindication of the Act of Union, and on the co-operation of the European races within the Union.   The resolution also condemned Republican propaganda.General Botha in his address to the Congress, referred to the movement to bring about a reunion between the South African Party and the Nationalists.
