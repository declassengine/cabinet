SECRET.APPRECIATION OP THE ATTACHED REPORT No. 103BRITISH  EMPIRE  AND AFRICA.Imperial Affairs.The representation of the Dominions at the Peace Conference as belligerent Powers marks an important epoch in the history of the relationship of the oversea nations to foreign countries (vide also under Canada, Australia and New Zealand).The suggested prohibition of Germans from entering or trading in British Colonies and Protectorates for a period of five years from the end of the war has been approved by the War Cabinet.Canada.The references of Sir Robert Borden to the representation of the Dominions at the Peace Conference, and to their future recognition in the League of Nations, are specially interesting. Sir Robert calls attention to recent develojnnents as the logical outcome of the Resolution upon the Constitution of the Empire which was passed on his proposal at the Imperial War Conference of 1917.Sir Wilfrid Laurier is now making a more strenuous bid for the support of the Liberal adherents of the Union Government. The outline of Liberal policy contains expected references to tariff matters and to &quot;Government by Order in Council.&quot;The question raised by the Dominion Government concerning enemy claims against&apos; British subjects, arising in neutral countries, deals with a matter of importance.It is satisfactory to note that the emigration of foreigners from the Dominion since the Armistice has somewhat relieved the labour situation.Australian Commonwealth.The observations , of Mr. Hughes upon the separate representation of the Dominions in the League of Nations are inspired by the same spirit of nationality that characterises the utterance of Sir Robert Borden. It will be noted that Mr. Hughes bases his claim for Australia upon the rights of self-government, and in this he will no doubt receive full support from his Labour opponents in Parliament, who take a strong stand upon the principles of autonomy in relation to Empire affairs.New Zealand.The telegram from the War Cabinet regarding the representation of New Zealand at the Peace Conference by means of only one delegate may certainly be said to reflect the view that will be strongly held in the Dominion. [i\t.o.
South Africa.The Parliamentary Session, though hardly likely to be remarkable for legislative achievement, promises to be full of incident as the result of Nationalist activities.The proceedings at the Nationalist Congress should be noted. While evidencing the usual arguments in favour of an independent South Africa, it shordd be observed that the Cape Nationalists insist on &quot; complete separation from the British Empire.&quot; The appointment of General Hertzog as one of the delegates to Europe may lead to interesting developments.India.It appears that Mrs. Besant is now uuable to exercise any control over the extremists, who are working against her in Madras, Bengal and the Punjab. An attempt to co-operate with the Moderates seems to be indicated as her next move.The Indian Civil Service Association is making its voice heard regarding the changes involved in the Reform Scheme.The movement for Woman Suffrage in connection with the Reform proposals seems to be &quot;growing, notwithstanding that at the last census it appeared that only twelve women in every thousand could read or write.German Colonies in Africa.The United States have made it clear that they do not Wish Liberia considered in connection with the captured German Colonies in territorial readjustments. A Protectorate is not contemplated, but the United States seem prepared to give definite assistance to Liberia as an independent Allied nation.H. d&apos;E.January 23rd, 1919.

9BRITISH  EMPIRE   AND   AFRICA  REPORT.IMPERIAL AFFAIRS.Representation of Dominions and India at Peace Conference. The official state-ment relating to the work of the Peace Conference (vide also Report No. 101) refers to the representation of the Dominions and India as follows : The British Dominions and India shall be represented as follows : Two Delegates each for Canada, Australia, South Africa, and India (including the Native States) ; one Delegate for New Zealand. Although the number of Delegates may not exceed the figures above mentioned, each Delegation has the right to avail itself of the panel system. The representation of the Dominions (including Newfoundland) and India may besides be included in the representation of the British Empire by the panel system.Return of Enemy Subjects. In a Memorandum recently submitted to the War Cabinet by the Colonial Office, it was pointed out that considerable apprehension was felt in the Colonies, particularly the Eastern Colonies, as to the possible consequences of the return of enemy subjects, who had been interned, to their normal places in the community, and the admission of other enemy subjects. It was pointed out that strong representations had come to hand from Hong Kong and the Straits, while the High Commissioner of the Western Pacific had stated his fears as to the detrimental effect on the native tribes of the return of Germans. In, Hong Kong the Governor stated that public opinion was strongly opposed to any German being allowed to enter at present, and this attitude was supported by the China Association, who were against German subjects being allowed to reside or trade in the Colonies for a period of years. The Governor of Jamaica also recommended legislation, and the Governor of the Straits telegraphed that the Federated Malay States had resolved that no German should be allowed to enter, reside or trade there for a period of years.The Legislative Council of Ceylon also passed a unanimous resolution against permitting any German or Austrian to reside in the Colony for some years, and the Chamber of Commerce supported this. The Memorandum proceeded to point out that Colonial conditions make it necessary to adopt a firm policy, as many colonies possess a large native population, and the European is often a planter controlling a large labour force in isolated places where he cannot be effectively watched. The Memorandum further suggested that Germans should be excluded from the Colonies and Protectorates for a period of five years on account of the danger of their fomenting disloyalty amongst the natives, the danger to the Germans themselves, the importance of restoring oversea trade without being hampered by unfair competition (particularly in Hong Kong and Singapore), and the bad effect on the natives of the triumphant return of Germans who had been removed.A proposal was therefore made that all the Colonies and Protectorates should be invited to enact immediate legislation prohibiting Germans from entering, residing or trading in their respective territories for a period of five years from the end of the war, power being given to the Governor to exclude individual&apos;subjects of other enemy States.The above proposals have been approved by the War Cabinet.SELF-GOVERNING   DOMINIONS.CANADA.Dominion and League of Nations. The Prime Minister (Sir Robert Borden) has issued a statement to the Press in Paris which deals with the future relationship of the Dominions to the League of Nations. Sir Robert Borden is reported as stating: &quot; In the Imperial War Conference oE 1917 I had the honour of moving, on behalf of Canada, a resolution which was accepted by the United Kingdom and the other
gaDominions, and which declared that the readjustment of constitutional relations of the component parts of the British Empire should be based upon a full recognition of the Dominions as autonomous nations of an Imperial Commonwealth. The principle thus established has been illustrated and carried into effect by the Peace Conference, in which the several Dominions have distinctive representation as members of the world-wide Britannic Commonwealth, which in one sense is itself a League of Nations.The ideal of equal nationhood within that Commonwealth has impressed itself very powerfully upon the imagination of the people of the Dominions during the present war, and they are satisfied of a like recognition in the greater League of Nations, to establish which the Peace Conference will forthwith bend its energies. The resolution of 1917, to which I have alluded, declared in emphatic terms the right of each Dominion to an adecpiate voice in the foreign policy and foreign relations with which the proposed League of Nations is intimately and vitally concerned.Liberal Policy. At the Convention of the newly-organised Eastern Ontario Liberal Association the lines of Liberal policy were indicated in an important speech of the Opposition Leader.(Sir Wilfrid Laurier) and by the Resolutions adopted.Sir Wilfrid Laurier appealed to his former followers who joined the Union Government to return to the Liberal Party. After stating that he had always ardently desired to win the wrar but had considered that compulsory military service was a mistake, Sir Wilfrid said : &quot; If we- have differed in the recent past upon a merely transient question which will not arise again, because Mr. Lloyd George has pledged himself to put an end to conscription, let the past be forgotten, and let us all be Liberals again, actuated onhy by conscience.&quot;The policy of the Party was indicated by Sir Wilfrid Laurier to include the following :-Fair treatment of returned soldiers and generous care for the dependants of those who died in the wrar. Tariffs for revenue purposes only. . Restoration of British preference to the pre-war status. Admission of foodstuffs free of duty from all countries which admit Canadian foodstuffs free, and progress generally towards freer trade. Abolition of Government by Order-in-Council and the censorship of the Press. Repeal of the War-time Elections Act. Support of a League of Nations which will make impossible a recurrence of war.Referring to the friendly relations of Canada and the United States, the Leader of the Opposition pointed out how all differences for 100 years had been settled by arbitration. It wras an example to the Peace Conference, these two countries living side by side without a fortress.   This, he said, was the highest type of civilisation.At the Convention, Resolutions were adopted expressing unfaltering confidence in Sir Wilfrid Laurier, and satisfaction that, &quot; thanks to his moderation and wisdom, the ranks of Liberalism are rapidly reuniting,&quot; and that &quot;in the conflict that lies close at hand between the forces of progress and the advocates of class privilege and reaction, the Liberal Party, wdth its strength renewed, will again lead the van in. asserting the rights of Canadian democracy.&quot; In speaking to the Resolution approving his leadership, Sir Wilfrid emphasised his willingness to retire from the position of leader and &quot; serve in the ranks under a younger general.&quot;Other Resolutions of the Convention expressed gratitude to the soldiers and a determination to protect their interests, and declared the intention of the Liberals to introduce into the Government of industry the principal of representation, whereby the interests of labour and the community will be considered in industrial control. The Convention denounced the war-time election as a foul blot on the national honour and a standing menace to the peace and progress of the Dominion. It demanded that staple foods and food products, other than wheat flour, domestic animals, and food therefor, should be admitted into Canada free of duty when they are the product of any country admitting Canadian articles free of duty, that a substantial reduction should be made in the general tariff on all articles except luxuries, and that the British preference, should be increased to 50 per cent, in the general tariff. The Convention further affirmed that to secure and retain responsible and representative government, the aristocratic, autocratic, and high Tory method of Orders-in-Council must be destroyed; and the further opinion w*as expressed that one of the most pressing needs is the restoration to the Canadian people of a public free from the interests and smothering control of Prussian paternalism.Discussing Sir W. LaurieFs speech at Ottawa, the Toronto Globe praises the Eastern Ontario Liberals for facing the tariff issue frankly.   It points out that the
Resolution adopted would give a large measure, of Free Trade with Great Britain, a substantial reduction in the general tariff, and an increase of the; British, preference to. 50 per cent. The Globe adds that the Resolutions will commend themselves, to the majority of Liberal Unionists or anti-Unionists, though there will be a difference of opinion as to the advisability of pressing them if there is a risk of plunging, the country into a general election before demobilisation is completed.Enemy Claims for Damages in Neutral Countries. The Dominion Government have called the attention of the British Authorities to. the subject of enemy claims for damages against British subjects by persons in neutral countries. These arise, it is stated, on account of the non-performance of contracts which have been rendered illegal by the Statutory Lists. In explanation, it is pointed out that the International Petroleum Company, a Canadian corporation, is liable to claims by Sloman arid Gildmeister, of Chile, for over one million dollars for failure to deliver oil contracts after August 1917, which was the date of the proclamation of the Statutory Lists. The Chilean Courts refused to recognise the Canadian proclamation as.a defence, and the Canadian Enemy Debts Committee are informed that Courts all over South Aurerican countries have adopted the same position. The Committee know of other cases against. United States citizens, and have suggested an agreement with Germany and Austria at the Peace Conference that ail. such claims should be withdrawn on the analogy of the recommendations, of the British Enemy Debts Committee as to claims under contract with persons of enemy countries. Such an agreement, it is pointed out, could be enforced against any claimant haying assets in. Germany or Austria. Failing such,assets, a claim could.be enforced by common diplomatic action.Labour Situation : Work of Exchanges. The Canadian Department of Labour announces that the labour situation in several industrial centres has been greatly relieved by the emigration from the Dominion of foreigners. Since the signing of the Armistice on November kith, upwards, of 5,000 from, three districts left Canada for Continental, Europe. The majority of these were. Italians, Serbians, Bulgarians and Austrians, many&apos; of whom, had been working during, the past three, years in munitions industries. Reports received by. the Department of Labour indicate that apart from several of the. larger cities, the labour situation is satisfactory andi that munition, workers as well: as soldiers are. being absorbed more rapidly than was anticipated.Twenty-five out of the sixty labour, exchanges which, the Canadian. Government proposes to establish throughout the Dominion to assist in the work o  repatriation and reconstruction, are now in.operation.Increase of Revenues. The Minister, for Immigration, and Colonisation reports that the returns for, the current fiscal year are. likely to show a, substantial- increase in the revenues of Canada. For the nine months period ended December 31st the current, revenue totalled almost. 225,500,000. dollars, representing an increase of approximately. 32,000,000 dollars. Of. this, increase the month, of December alone contributed about 8,000,000 dollars. Despite the prohibition; of, the traffic in intoxicating, liquor, the Canadian Excise and. Customs revenues show. an. increase over the corresponding period ok 1917-18.Federal. Control of,Land for Settlement. In addition, to introducing legislation at the next session of. Parliament, giving the. Settlement Board: power, to expropriate agricultural, lands., not under, cultivation, the Government, of- Ontario will place their Crown lairds at the disposal qf the Federal, authorities for, settlement purposes. The&apos; Province, however, will, retain., its title, tp the land. Legislation will be-provided giving the Dominion, Government, power to make a lien- against the property as security for,money advanced to,returned soldiers,for, equipment, .For spm.e time-the Provincial, Government has. been conducting the settlement of soldiers, at Kapuskasing, but by an agreement reached at the recent, conference at Ottawa, the Federal -authorities will,now take, over this work.Ontario Government and - Liquor Control. The Ontario Government announce their decision to take over the sale oh liquor in the Province. The seven private agencies now operating in the Province under the auspices of the Government will be abolished and&apos; new dispensaries will be established- in their place. By this action, the-Government hope to do away with the abuses existing at the present-time, while the public are assured of a.continuance of liquor supply for medicinal purposes.
AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH.Commonwealth and League of Nations. The Prime Minister (Mr. -Hughes) has inade a public statement in favour of the Dominions entering the League of Nations on the same basis as Belgium and other smaller Powers. Mr. Hughes is reported as stating : &quot; The Dominions fought in the war as separate nations, and the fact that we are nations has been formally recognised by the Peace Conference by its giving the Dominions separate representation. Nothing but direct representation -would be satisfactory to. the Dominions, because they would feel that under any other conditions their identity would be merged in that of the many members of the Empire, and their interests would be endangered. The principle of separate representation is sound, and expresses the real character of that which is known as the British Empire, but Avhich is in effect a commonwealth of free nations, bound together by ties of race, language, tradition, and common interests and common ideals. The League of Nations might conceivably seek to interfere with the rights of self-government,&apos; which we value so dearly as to sacrifice all things in order to secure them. The Dominions take a legitimate and proper pride in their great efforts during the war. They, -fought for liberty and self-government, and have established a right to these by the sacrifices and. efforts they have made. They feel that they must come directly before this great world tribunal whose influence upon the fate of all nations will be all-important.&quot;French Labour Delegates. The Federal Ministry gave a luncheon last week in honour of the French Labour Delegates, MM. Paul Thomsen and Adolf Hodee. The guests included Mr. Tudor, the Labour Party Leader. The Acting Prime Minister, Mr. Watt, in welcoming the delegates, referred to the affectionate regard the people of Australia had for the French. He invited the delegates to prolong their -visit. M. Thomsen, in reply, expressed the hope that the closer relationships between the two nations would endure for ever.Guarantee to Wheat Growers. The Acting Prime Minister has arranged for the payment of the guarantee to wheat growers for the .1918-19 crop, amounting approximately to 11,000,000/.NEW ZEALAND.Representation at Peace Conference, With reference to the representation of the Dominion at the Peace Conference by means of one delegate (vide under &quot; Imperial Affairs&quot;), the WTar Cabinet decided to send a telegram on January loth to the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom in Paris stating that the War Cabinet had observed that New Zealand was to have only one representative, and suggesting that this was to be regretted in view of the &quot;following facts : -That the white population of the Dominion did not materially differ from that of South Africa in number ; that the representatives of the Dominion had not yet arrived; that the contribution of the Dominion in men was larger in proportion to population than any other Dominion.SOUTH AFRICA.Parliamentary Session. At the Session of Parliament which opened on January 17th, it appears, from published statements, that the Government intend to restrict business as far as possible to finance, and that only one Government Bill of first-class importance, dealing with public health administration, will be introduced. While the Nationalists show every intention of attacking the Government, a section of the Unionists hold strong views on the treatment during the Avar of enemy subjects, more especially of interned Germans. The Unionists indicate also their intention of pressing for national recognition of financial responsibilities in regard to returned soldiers.Nationalist Congress. The Nationalist Congress opened at Bloemfontein on January 16th, Avhen the question of appointing a deputation for the purpose of
proceeding to  Europe to   demand  independence for South Africa came up for consideration.   General de Wet sent a message wishing success to the meeting, and. expressing his regret for his absence, which was necessitated by the terms of his parole.General Hertzog, addressing the Congress, said the question was whether they were to be free or to continue in their present position of servitude. The assertion that they had a free Constitution and free Government he regarded as pure mockery. The Union Government, he maintained, consisted of men who consulted solely the interests of the British Empire. The people&apos;s blood was shed, their money was wasted, their freedom was- curtailed, harbours were closed to neutral ships, citizens were forced into internment camps, and consumptives who had been kept out of the country by law, were now invited to enter in hundreds of thousands. He declared that South Africa was nothing but the football of the Empire. He considered the independence of the Free State as higher than their subjection to the Union. The National Convention was not formulated by the people, he contended, but by the four Colonies subject to the Crown of England, and none of the Colonies had power to alter its subjection to Great Britain by one jot or tittle. They had been told that Natal would not have independence. Well, Natal should have a free choice just as the Free Staters demanded freedom of choice.Mr. Tielman .Roos, who was introduced as the father of the movement,-claimed that Mi-. Lloyd George&apos;s and President Wilson&apos;s speeches regarding the sslf-de-termiimtion of small nations meant the restoration of the Transvaal as a Republic. Proceeding, Mr. Roos said : &quot; Whatever may happen, we have joined issue, and we intend to make this the great point of difference between our party and the Other parties.&quot;Mr. Spies, of Natal, said that fifty Natal delegates were present demanding freedom. Now that the Allies were victorious, he said, they could make this demand without hurting the feelings of their British fellow-citizens.Dr. Malan, the Cape Nationalist leader, said that the Cape also demanded the right to decide its own future. The Cape&apos;s standpoint was that the fact of- the Union should not be an obstacle to the demand of those in the North for justice. It was unthinkable that Great Britain could place any obstacle in the way of inde-pendence. If the.y wanted a happy South Africa they must take away the flag that belonged to only one section, and put up a flag which was not a symbol of power to one section and a reminder to the other section of injustices in its past history.After confirmation of correspondence which had been exchanged with His Majesty King George and with President Wilson, Congresses of the four provinces were successively constituted, the first being that of the Free State.General Hertzog, in a further speech, pointed out that the British Colonial Secretary did not guarantee that a South African deputation would be received by the King or by the Imperial Government, but that, he went on to say, need not make them withdraw. The recent elections showed that the British people was Imperialist in mind, and, seeing that Lord Milner was the new Colonial Secretary, he was prepared to hear that the deputation would not be received.Mr. Havenga, M.L.A., moved a lengtlt3r resolution, which, after referring to the declarations of Mr. Lloyd George and President Wilson, demanded the restoration of its former free independence to the Free State, and suggested the despatch of two delegates to Europe to request His Majesty to grant the restoration of its freedom and independence.Professor Fremantle asked, in view of the suspicion of the British section, that .- the resolution   be so  amended as  to  make  it clear that their attitude towards England and Englishmen was friendly.General Hertzog, speaking again, said they wanted an end to the bad relations between the British and Dutch, and that was one of the reasons for their demand for a free country. Proceeding- to adopt Professor Fremantle&apos;s suggestion, General Hertzog moved an amendment to the effect that the Congress wanted independence, while preserving the friendly relationship between the peoples of South Africa and of the United Kingdom.   The motion was carried with the amendment.The Congress then,. with much enthusiasm, appointed General Hertzog and General De Wet Free State delegates, General Hertzog remarking he did not think the Government could be so smallminded as to refuse General De Wet permission for this purpose. The Transvaal Congress also passed a resolution demanding inde-pendence, and nominated as it delegates Senator Wolmarans and Mr. Pi el or Grobler,&apos; ex-M.L.A.   The Congress then adjourned.
Ata meeting of the Cape Provincial section of the Nationalist Congress a long resolution was adopted to the effect that the great majority of the Dutch-speaking population of South Africa would not be satisfied till the complete independence of their Union was assured and complete separation from the British Empire attained. Such independence, the resolution stated, would achieve a better understanding and lasting peace-between the different sections of the population of South Africa, and promote healthy and friendly relations between South Africa and the United Kingdom.An amendment by Professor Fremantle in favour of eliminating the phrase &quot; complete separation from the British Empire,&quot; and leaving the demand simply for -complete independence by which South Africa would become a Sovereign State, was defeated by an overwhelming majority.Coloured Men and Franchise. A meeting of coloured, persons was held at Johannesburg on January 7th in furtherance of the agitation for the removal of the colour bar from the Union constitution, and a resolution was adopted for transmission to the Peace Conference, urging that no part of the conquered German territories should be placed under the control of the Union until the political disabilities of the coloured people of the Union had been removed. The resolution was identical with that adopted by the meeting of coloui*ed people at Capetown on December 27th (vide Report No. ltd).Wool Clip. A general permit issued by the Army Council, and published in the Gazette of January 17th, removed all restrictions on the importation of and dealings in South African wool and tops produced from it. This step was the natural result of the virtual rejection by the South African farmers of the Imperial Governments offer to buy their wool on the same terms as those on which the Australian and New Zealand clips Avere bought. The quantity registered for sale to the Imperial Government was negligible, and the offer therefore terminated.INDIA.(Excluding External Affairs, which are dealt with in the Eastern Report.)The Extremists and Mrs. Besant. The Extremists who cajotured the Delhi Congress have been working against the leadership of Mrs. Besant in Madras, Bengal, and the Punjab. From published statements it appears that Mrs. Besant has found it impossible to hold the Madras Extremists, and that she has removed the headquarters of the Home Rule League to Bombay. Mrs. Besants points of difference with the Extremists are set out in an article published in New India on January 11th, and may be summarised by the letter which Mr. C. P. Pamaswami Aiyar, her colleague, and one of the secretaries of Congress, has sent to the Press. Explaining the reasons for resigning office, he says that the party he belongs to feels that the path of wisdom, especially in view of the English elections and the defeat of the Labour Party and most of the friends of Indian progress, and in Auew of the attempt to whittle down the Reform Scheme, is to adhere to the special Congress programme settled at Bombay at the special meeting held in August 1916 ; that it is advisable to infuse fresh life, into the Congress Committee in London, and revivify the newspaper India ; that Mr. Tilak must not represent India at the Peace Conference, and that no iiseful purpose can be served by a deputation to England which has not discretion vested in it and authority toi negothite, subject to the general principles of the Congress, but is bound by the resolution of the Congress to press for a set scheme.Indian Civil Service a.nd Reform Scheme. At the last meeting of the members of the Indian Civil Service held on November 29th at Madras an Indian Civil Service Association was formed to promote the interests of the service in the Presidency. At the meeting a rough draft of a memorial was apparently drawn up criticising the Montagu-Chelnisford Reform Scheme. The same day Neio India, Mrs. BesanPs mewspapei-, published a copy of the memorial.   It occupied more than four columns
of the newspaper, and dealt with the manner in which the service will suffer by the - scheme.  ,In the course of the memorial the following passages occurred : - -  -.- &quot; (1) What we ask is that we may be told in explicit terms what is meant by the. -substantial improvements in the conditions of service and the special measures of protection to which the authors of the report allude, and whether the improvements will benefit us or only our successors ;&quot; (2) That such of us as are not prepared to make themselves pawns in what is termed in the report one of the greatest political experiments ever undertaken in the worlds history, should be given the option of retiring on pensions calculated with reference to their service and loss of prospects, or should be offered posts similar to those they now hold either at home or in other parts of the British Empire ; and&quot; (H) That the pensions of all members of the service should be guaranteed to them by the British Parliament.&quot;Woman Franchise.1 The movement for woman suffrage in connection with constitutional reforms has received the support of the Indian Women&apos;s Education Association. This body has promoted a memorial to Lord Southborough which has now reached him in India, where he is presiding over the Committee appointed under the Montagu-Chelmsford Scheme to frame an electoral franchise. The memorial is supported by 19 other organisations in the United Kingdom, chiefly of women, but including the Britain and India Association and the Central Islamic Society, and the individual signatures include those of the Aga Khan (who wrote at length on the subject in his recent book), Princess Sophia Dhuleep Singh, Lord Ilaldane, Lady Selborne, Bishop Welldon, the Reverend Dr. Gaster, and many others.GERMAN COLONIES IN AFRICA.Position of Liberia. The State Department at Washington after considering the proposal of the British Government that financial aid to and rehabilitation of Liberia might be considered at the Peace Conference, submitted these views to the Secretary of State in Paris. The reply has now been delivered to the effect that the American Peace Mission consider that the subject has no bearing on other questions which will be considered by the Peace Conference and should be settled directly among the Governments. The Peace Mission points out that Liberia is an independent allied nation and not to lie considered in connection with captured German Colonies in West Africa or any possible re-adjustment of territory. It is mentioned that the time has now arrived when the United States desire to give favourable consideration to the appeals of Liberia, and of the 12,000,000 coloured people in the United States, for more definite assistance to be extended than has been given in the past. It is added that the proposal outlined in the Memorandum of the State Department of November 19th does not indicate that the United States have the slightest desire or intention to establish a Protectorate over Liberia but rather purposes to maintain the historic position as Liberia&apos;s next friend.
