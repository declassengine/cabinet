SECRET.APPRECIATION OF THE ATTACHED REPORT No. 136.BRITISH  EMPIRE&apos; AND AFRICA.Canada.The debate in Parliament upon the Peace Treaty has proved important both on account of the Ministerial statements and of the Opposition^ criticisms. The constitutional position of the Dominion within the Empire and as a member of the League of Nations has naturally afforded an interesting subject for discussion. The Liberal objection to the Canadian delegates signing the Treaty as representatives of the Canadian nation rather than as purely Empire delegates is probably based more upon the fear of bringing Canada into European politics than upon anything else.Other items of interest in this Report relate to trade with the LTuited States and Great Britain, to the settlement of British soldiers and to the number of settlers coming from the United States.Australian Commonwealth.The Prime MinisteFs pronouncement upon the necessity of the Government receiving a mandate from the people probably indicates that a General Election may take place towards the end of this year.Mr. Hughes has made an emphatic declaration against the resumption of trade relations with Germany.It seems that a determined effort will be made at the Inter-State Labour Con-ference to replace Mr. Tudor as leader of the Labour Party by offering the position to Mr. Ryan. If. the Premier of Queensland accepts, it will no doubt consolidate the Irish Catholics against Mr. Hughes, though the Nationalists may easily gain something in other directions.The statement issued by the Premier of New South Wales shows that even the individual State Governments recognise the necessity of additions to the powers of the Commonwealth.South Africa.It is perhaps fitting that General Smuts&apos; first important speech as Prime Minister of the Union should be devoted to an exposition of the Peace Treaty, in the work of which he played so great a part. His references to the constitutional status of the Dominions should be noted. - [p.t.o.
The Nationalists do not, of course, admit any failure in connection with their recent mission. Though from the point of view of the general public the visit may be regarded as a fiasco, it must be remembered that the Nationalist leaders are astute politicians and they have probably succeeded in strengthening their position amongst the back veldt farmers. The untimely death of General Botha has unfortunately removed an influence which kept many of the Dutchmen with Nationalist leanings within the ranks of the South African Party.India.The references of the Viceroy to the Reforms scheme, the Exchange situation and the trading rights of Indians in the Transvaal are important.H. d&apos;E.September 11th, 1919.

BRITISH   EMPIRE   AND   AFRICA  REPORT.SELF-GOVERNING   DOMINIONS.CANADA.Parliament and Peace Treaty. The Prime Minister (Sir Robert Borden) informed the British Government by telegram dated September 5th that he had arranged with the Opposition that the Debate on the Peace Treaty should conclude not later than Sej)tember 11th.On September 5th the Senate passed the Resolution asking Parliament to approve the Peace Treaty. A . motion made by Senator Bostock, the Liberal leader, for an adjournment until September 16th, to give Senators an opportunity to familiarise themselves with the Treaty, was defeated.Sir James A. Lougheed, the Government leader in the Senate, defending Clause X., said that if the nation was to enjoy the advantages of the terms of the Peace Treaty and the Covenant of the League of Nations it must be prepared to bear a share of the responsibilities for the enforcement of the terms of the document. If Canada failed to agree to assume any responsibility, after the share it had taken in the war and in the negotiations for peace, it would be acting the part of a poltroon. Canada would be unable to look civilisation face.Senator Dandurand (Liberal, Dorimien) favoured Canada&apos;s joining the League, but thought it well to wait and see the leading Powers sign first, and particularly the United States. Senator Roche (Liberal, Halifax) and Senator Beique (Liberal, De Salaberry) feared the agreement might lead eventually to a conflict with Great Britain, Circumstances might arise where the statesmen of Great Britain might feel obliged to disregard the League, and if Canada adhered to the Covenant then it might be brought into conflict with Britain. They felt that the approval of the Canadian Parliament was a matter of indifference, as Canada would be bound by the action of the Imperial Parliament.In the House of Commons the Minister of Justice (Mr. Doherty) has taken charge of the Government Resolution to approve the Peace Treaty, owing to the Prime Minister being confined to bed with a chill.On Sej)tember 2nd Mr. Ernest Lapointe (Kamouraska) urged that full consiclera-tion should be given to Article 10 under which, he said, Canada contracted obligations in regard to the preservation of territorial integrities, and it was important to know what those obligations were. M. Lapointe also argued that the fact that Canada signed the Treaty as a separate nation created an anomalous and equivocal position. He wanted to know what would happen if Great Britain and the United States were embroiled and the League decided against Great Britain. Canada would either- have to violate the League or break with her own constitution. He expressed himself as strongly opposed to any schemes of centralisation which would result in the Dominion being governed by a Central Imperial body. Government, he said, by any such body as the Imperial War Cabinet would never satisfy the Canadian people.Mr.&quot; Fielding intimated that it was needless for Canada to ratify the Treaty, and wanted to know what would be the effect if Parliament refused to ratify itThe Prime Minister (Sir R. Borden) replied that Canada would stand apart from the rest of the Empire if she declined to accept a Treaty which was accepted by the rest of the Empire.   If the suggestion were made that ratification was a farce, that the United Kingdom had such power that it could impose its will, then members of - the Opposition were thinking of ancient history.The Acting Opposition Leader (Mr. D. D. Mackenzie) spoke in the debate on, &quot;September 8th. and argued that the Canadian delegates should not have signed the Treaty as a separate nation, but simply as delegates of the Empire as a whole. By signing as a separate nation they bound Canada to the European nations without consulting Parliament. He believed the Covenant to override the free will of the people as expressed in Parliament.The President of the Privy Council (Mr. Rowell), in reply, said that apparently the Opposition either wanted to retain the old Colonial status of Canada or else to
ohave complete independence. Neither, he said, expressed the Canadian- idea, which was that Canada had-the powers.of a nation within the Britannic League of Nations. He pointed out that if the League asked Canada to take&apos; action&apos; against the Mother Country Canada could refuse, and the. Council of the League could take no action except with unanimous consent.Police and Trade Unions. -In lire Dominion House of Commons on September 8th the Minister of Justice introduced a Bill to prohibit members of the Dominion Police and the North-West Mounted Police from belonging to trade unions.New Minister of Public Works.   Mr. A. L. Sifton has relinquished the portfolio of Minister of Customs and Inland Revenue for that of Public Works, rendered vacant by the resignation of Mr. F. B, Garvell.Minister of Finance and Victory Loan.  Sir Henry Dray ton, the new Dominion Minister of Finance, made his first special appeal for the new &apos;&apos;Victory &quot; Loan at the Toronto Fair on September 10th.Trade Returns. The Canadian trade returns for the first four -months of the present financial year show imports valued at $870,000,000 and exports $1,264,000,000. The amount of Customs duty collected in the period named shows a reduction of only $2,000,000. Imports from Great Britain show an increase of $3,300,000, whilst imports from the^United States declined $96,000,000,--Exports to the United States increased by $80,000,000.Settlers from United States. During July 2,050 settlers came from the United States, as against 1,370 in July last year, and they brought double the value of property entered then.Settlement of British Soldiers. In connection with the regulations published in Ottawa respecting the scheme for settling in Canada men who have served in the Imperial Forces and who were not resident in the Dominion before the war, ReuteFs Agency is informed by the Soldier Settlement Board of Canada that-these regulations, specifically provide, in regard to the probation of prospective settlers under the scheme as follows : (1) Those inexperienced in agriculture will spend two years in training at practical farming.(2) Those with farming experience in the old land will spend sufficient time with selected farmers in Canada, under the supervision of the Board, to become familiar with Oanadian methods.(3) Settlers on purchased land are recpiired to pay down 20 per cent, of the purchase-price,(4) Qualification committees will pass on applicants both before and after-training.(5) In the matter of qualification, evidence of the adaptability necessary to enable applicants to fit into Canadian life and make a success of farming will be an important consideration.Information wall be published later as to the place and method of making application. ;AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEaLTH.Parliament and Peace Treaty.--The British Government-have been informed that the Commonwealth Government will submit the Resolution approving ox the Peace Treaty to Parliament on September 10ih. It is considered probable that Parliamentary approval will be given within a fortnight.Prime Minister and a General Election Speaking at Melbourne on September 5th the Prime Minister (Mr. Hughes) said : &quot; Australia must have a Constitutional Government that has a clear, direct mandate from the people.&quot; Referring to the general political outlook, he declared that whatever became of the other League of Nations, the League of the British Empire would never perish.Prime Minister and German Trade. The Prime Minister (Mr. Hughes), address-ing a meeting of the Nationalist Federation in Melbourne last week, said that Germany stood to-day the best organised nation in the world for a commercial war. Some people spoke to him of trade relations with Germany. If they wanted trade relations with Germany they must get somebody else.88S4-2a A 2
Opposition Leader- The Inter-State. --Conference of the Labour Party is to.meet in Adelaide on September loth and a motion will be submitted in favour of asking the Premierof. Queensland (Mr. Ryan) to enter the Common wealth Parliament. Meantime Mr. Ryan has issued a long statement criticising the actions and policy of the Nationalist Party led by Mr. Hughes!Mr. Ryan and Imperial Federation. In the Queensland House of Assembly last week the Premier of the State (Mr. Ryan) stated that if a Bid was introduced in the British Parliament, dealing with the subject of Imperial federation he would convey to the British Premier the strong opposition of the people of Queensland to surrendering Australia^ self-governing rights.States and Commonwealth. The Premier of New South Wales (Mr. W. A. Holman), with the tacit concurrence, it is stated, of the other State Premiers, issued to the public on September 8th a long statement explaining why the retention of States was imperative; He asserts that there are four courses open: (1) unification; (2) complete abandonment of Federation: (3) adoption of the Canadian system; (4r a small measure of reform to reduce existing friction and the&apos;duplication of effort. He strongly champions the fourth alternative, and expresses his readiness to transfer the whole of the.Customs Revenue to the Commonwealth and also to give the Federation power to levy income-tax, but he adds that the whole power and direction of taxation should be vested in the States.SOUTH AFRICA.Parliament and Peace Treaty. The Prime Minister (General Smuts) introduced the Resolution asking Parliament to approve the Peace Treaty in the House of Assembly oh September 8th. Reports indicate that the speech was largely devoted to explaining the enhancement of the Constitutional status of the Dominions^ which he described as &quot; one of the greatest and most important landmarks in the history of the British Empire&quot; He declined to believe that this would tend to dismemberment. The effect would be crude the contrary. He said: &quot; While we want national recognition, we also want to remain within the British League of Nations.&quot;After tracing the inception and explaining the objects of the League, of Nations, General Smuts expressed the belief that the first chapter of the Peace Treaty would remain as &quot; the most potent instrument for human good ever devised &quot; when all the &quot;blots and blemishes &quot; of the peace settlement had disappeared.The chapter on penalties he described as one of the &quot; great battle-grounds &quot; at Versailles, and incidentally he mentioned that General Botha had been strongly opposed to the trial of any but &quot;a small number of the most pronounced criminals.&quot;Nationalists and their Mission. Speaking at Pietermaritzburg in regard to the recent Nationalist Mission to Europe, General Hertzog stated last week that he was not at. all pessimistically disposed. The deputation was far from having suffered defeat.   Victory was gained, though not a smashing victory, but he felt no defeat.Mr. Wolmarans, the Transvaal member of the deputation, speaking at Pretoria, declared : &quot; The Mission had assured that the freedom of South Africa would never be killed. Now it is no longer a struggle for the deputation but for the people themselves.   The people would be called upon to decide its own future.&quot;It had been arranged that a public meeting should take place at Pietermaritzburg on the night of September 4th, but owing to a manifestation of public hostility towards the Nationalist Leader, the gathering was abandoned and General Hertzog left the town.Asiatics in the Transvaal. A largely attended meeting was held at Pretoria on September 4th to consider the question of Asiatics in the Transvaal. Representatives of the Transvaal municipal authorities, Chambers of Commerce, trades unions, the &quot; Comrades of the Great War,&quot; and various agricultural and political organisations were present. The Mayor of Pretoria urged that moderation should be shown in dealing with the question. The Chairman said there was no need for foreboding as they were&apos;all actuated by the British spirit of fair play. The Asiatic menace, he said, threatened the very foundations of the Union, and unless the clanger was realised, South Africa would not remain a country for white men. The underlying question therefore was. much wider than merely one of trading rights, and also conflicted with the aims of the trades unions for raising the status of the workers,
The meeting by an overwhelming majority passed the following Resolution proposed by Senator Muunik : &quot; This meeting views with the greatest&apos; alarm the &apos; serious menace to the economic and social welfare of the inhabitants of the Transvaal occasioned by the continued encroachment of Asiatics, and advocatesimmediate measures to deal with this question.&quot;The following Resolution was also subsequently passed by a very &quot;large majority, viz. : &quot; Inasmuch as the legal restrictions against encroachments by Asiatics in the past have failed, by reason of the persistent evasion of the laws by Asiatics ancl ineffective administration-of the laws by the Government, this Congress strongly urges the more stringent application of the restrictions in the future, and protests against any relaxation or modification of these laws and the granting of any civic rights to Asiatics ancl urges Parliament to legislate as soon as possible in accordance with the objects of this Congress.&quot;The meeting decided upon the formation of a &quot; South Africans&apos; League,&quot; among the objects of which is to secure the expropriation, subject to just compensation, of all immovable property vested in Asiatics, and the general elimination, by all reason-able and statesmanlike means, of Asiatics resident and trading in the Transvaal. Sir Abe Bailey was elected President, and a vote of thanks for his stand, on the subject in Parliament was carried.INDIA.Viceroy and Legislative Council..-*-In opening the Legislative Council last week, the Viceroy (Lord Chelmsford) alluded to tfie Reform scheme and expressed regret that some who were interested in this great question had done such scant justice to the Government of India. Pre hoped Parliament would shortly deliver &apos; its final judgment. He would loyally accept its decision, and he hoped all who ,had been engaged in the great controversy would sink their differences and concentrate their efforts on making the reforms a success. He hoped a Committee of experts would be able to find a solution of the exchange problem- ancl ensure stability in the value of the rupee. ,Touching upon the question of the trading rights of Indians in the Transvaal, he said that the Government had fully pressed the Indian point of view on His Majesty&apos;s Government, and urged that the recent legislation in this connection in South Africa was unjustified. He pleaded for calmness and moderation,: while admitting the strength of the feeling in South Africa, and said that it was proposed to send Sir Benjamin Robertson on a deputation to represent Indian interests oh the Union Government Commission. The Government, moreover, were pressing for the immediate cancellation of indentures in Fiji. .,.r. -  ;,    -As to the future, the Viceroy said he desired to lay deep the foundations for new industrial development.   The views of the Government on the report of-the Industrial Commission were now before the Secretary of State, and his reply was expected in a . few weeks.Economic Conditions. The Viceroy telegraphed to the India Office on September 5th that the prospects of crops were generally satisfactory, but that some damage by excessive rain was reported from the United Provinces, Rajputana, Central India, the Central Provinces ancl Bombay. Distress in the United Provinces of Agra and - Oudh had almost disappeared.
