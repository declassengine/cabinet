SECHST-AL&apos;PliEOIA&apos;LTON Oli THE ATTACHED REPORT No. 95.BRITISH  EMPIRE  AND AFRICA.Imper ial Affaius&quot;.Some points relating to the position in the Dominions regarding alien trading rights are given under this head.Canada.The active measures which are being put into operation to enable industrial effort to be transferred to reconstructive purposes obviously contemplate that the Dominion shall have a considerable share of reconstructive work in devastated Europe. The &quot; Canada Trade Mission &quot; will, no doubt, play an important part in this connection, and also in bringing about a more direct touch between the Dominion and the Govern-ment Departments in London on various post-war matters vitally affecting Canada.Meantime the Government are taking all necessary steps to maintain industrial efficienc3r during the transition period between war and peace conditions.Organised labour appears likely to make itself felt in connection with Govern-ment post-war policy, and the association of a Labour representative with Sir R. Borden in London is a significant step.The outline of the plans for demobilising the Dominion troops and for training soldiers for land settlement will be read with interest.The suspension of the operation of the Military Service Act and the revocation of the Order prohibiting strikes are amongst the immediate results of the armistice.Newfoundland. The Prime Minister is expected in England next week.Australian Com m on wealth.The unanimous Resolution of both Houses of the Commonwealth Parliament in favour of the retention of the Pacific Islands, and the remarkable speech.of Mr: Watt on the subject, provide a significant reminder of the strength of public opinion, which
has already manifested itself in other ways. The attitude of Mr. Tudor as Leader of the Official Labour Opposition indicates a desire to placate the pacifist element in his party. Iij this connection it will be interesting to see if, in view of the Canadian consultation with Labour and the South African invitation to the Leader of the Opposition, a further attempt will be made to get Official Labour represented in peace discussions. (Vide Report No. 59.) It is possible, however, that Mr. Tudor inay accompany the Parliamentary Delegation to England next year.New Zealand.It appears that Mr. Massey and Sir Joseph Ward cannot arrive in this country till January. The opposition of the Dominion Government to the terms of the proposed British offer for the South African wool clip shows a desire for a common Imperial policy in such matters.South Afrtca.The invitation which it appears has been extended to the Leader of the Opposition (Sir Thomas Smartt) to accompany General Botha to England is obviously&apos; a recognition of the valuable and unselfish part played by the Unionist Party in supporting the Government during the war. While Coalition Ministries have been formed ; in the United Kingdom,. Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, and will be represented in peace discussions, it would certainly have been unfortunate if, in the peculiar conditions of South African politics, the patriotic Leader of the Opposition should have been unable to voice the sentiments of his followers in the consideration of the great issues Avhich so vitally affect the African Continent.The enquiry regarding policy towards interned enemy civilians is probably influenced by the belief that Nationalist agitation may soon show itself in the matter.India.(Excluding External Affairs.)The Native States will again be represented at the session of the Imperial War Cabinet by the Maharaja of Bikanir. Sir Satyendra Sinha will, as already announced, be the representative of British India in the Cabinet. Some interestiug opinions are given in this report regarding the proposed Indian Colony iu East Africa and the probable effect npon the African natives., :    ,, ,    .    .

BRITISH  EMPIRE  AND  AFRICA  REPORT.IMPERIAL AFFAIRS.Alien Trading Rights in the Dominions. A memorandum lias been, prepared for the War Cabinet relating to the restrictions on the operations of enemy, allied or neutral firms, as regards ownership of property, export of goods, &amp;c, within or from the Empire. As regards the Dominions, it is pointed out that the rule generally is to extend equal trading rights to all persons or firms, whether British or foreign, though extensive measures have been taken during the war to deal with enemy interests. Amongst the measures of a more permanent character enacted in the Dominions the following may be mentioned : In Canada there is power to close the coasting trade to ships of any nationality, bnt the ships of Italy, Belgium and Holland are still admitted. The Canadian law provides that real and personal property may be acquired and disposed of by an alien in the same manner as by a natural-born British subject (R.S. 1906, c. 77) but free grants of land in the Prairie Provinces are limited to British subjects or to those declaring their intention of becoming British. Canadian legislation provides that the majority of the directors of joint-stock Banks shall be natural-born or naturalised British subjects (3 &amp; 4 Geo. 5, c. 9, s. 20), and also that the majority of the directors of railways (the construction of which has been assisted by the Canadian Govern-ment) shall be British (R.S. 1906,. c. 38, s. 112). As to the control of merchant shipping, Canadian Orders-in-council have been passed having effect for three years after the war (Order-in-Oouucil, March 9th, 1915, and October 9th, 1917).In the Australian Commonwealth the Government has full power to regulate the coasting trade. The regulations apply generally to all ships, whether British or foreign, but no vessel can engage in coasting trade which receives a subsidy from a foreign Government. As to the tenure of Crown land by aliens, restrictions are imposed in certain States of Australia which do not apply to natural-born or naturalised British subjects. The membership of the Commonwealth Metal Exchange is confined to natural-born British subjects domiciled in Australia, and practically all sales and purchases of minerals for export have to be registered.In New Zealand power has been taken to impose a special ad valorem tax of 50 per cent, on enemy goods (Act No. 39 of 1915, s. 28). As to acquiring land, any alien resident in New Zealand may hold or dispose of every description of property as if he were a natural-born British subject. Action has been taken in New Zealand regarding the control of merchant shipping, and no limit of time is mentioned. (War Regulations, December 21st, 1916, and Shipping Regulations. June 11th. 1917.)In Newfoundland a Non-Ferrous Metals Act (8 &amp; 9 George 5. c. 14) has been passed on the lines of recent legislation in the United Kingdom, with the object of preventing the grant of licences to persons of enemy nationality. As to merchant shipping, legislation has been passed similar to the United Kingdom (Act 34 of 1917). ^SELF-GOVERNING   DOMINIONS.CANADA.Arrival of Prime Minister. The Prime Minister (Sir Robert Borden) arrived in London on November 17th. He was accompanied by the Minister of Trade and Commerce (Sir George Foster), the Minister of Customs (Mr. Sifton), the Chairman
of &quot;the Canadian War Trade Board (Mr. Frank Jones), the Chairman of the Canadian War Mission (Mr. Lloyd Harris), the Judge Advocate-General (Lieutenant-Colouel-O. M. Biggar), the Secretary of the Trades and Labour Congress of Canada (Mr. P. M. Draper), Dr. J. W. Robertson, of the Canada Food Board, and various officials. . . .The Minister of Justice (Mr. C. J. Doherty) is understood to be on his way to this country, and will arrive during the week.War Industries and Reconstruction in Europe. The Acting Prime Minister (Sir Thomas White) made some important references, in a recent statement, to the utilisation of war industries for reconstructive effort, and to the share which Canada is able to take in reconstruction oversea.     He said : &quot; The problem is to replace the output or the volume of the turnover of our Canadian war industries by an ecpial or if possible a greater output of industries supplying material for reconstruction, both overseas and at home. In large measure, it is hoped and expected that the volume of the war industries production will be replaced by the requirements of reconstructive work overseas in France, Belgium, and other countries. By reason of the part that Canada has played in the war, she is entitled, as her right, to share in the business of reconstruction, and we are in a position financially to participate in any inter-Allied loans for this purpose. Canada can, for example, continue to give extensive credits, and Canada can be used to. purchase all kinds of structural and other material recptired in the rebuilding of Europe.&quot; Canada&apos;s claim in this respect, the Minister continued, was overwhelmingly strong. Firstly, she iiad played a great part as a belligerent, and secondly, she could finance the business. Sir Thomas White stated that the xoolicy of the country should be &quot; Production, Production, and again Production,&quot; in order not only to assist in feeding hungry Europe but also to maintain the balance of exports over imports which had been brought about by the w^ar.Reconstruction at Home : Shipbuilding and Railways. The policj7 of the Govern-ment. regarding reconstruction in the Dominion was also referred to by the Acting Prime Minister. He said there must be no hesitation in spending money freely in order to bring the railways generally up to standard. The shipbuilding yards, he said, would be kept at full capacity with Government orders. . For the year 1918-19, the Government programme of expenditure on shipbuilding was -$65,000,000. The railway and ship construction programme of the Government should keep the steel plates, car and locomotive plants, together with their subsidiary industries, busy for months and even for years.As to the practical measures taken by the Dominion Government to maintain industrial effort during the period of transition from war to peace conditions, it is announced that orders have been placed for 200,000 gross tons of 854b. steel rails, which will be used for the betterment and extension of Canadian railways. The Dominion Steel Corporation at Sydney has been given an order for 125,000 tons.Organised, Labour and Reconstruction. Since he appeared before the Cabinet at Ottawa with Sir John Willison and the members of the Canadian Industrial Becon-struction Association to present the views of organised labour upon reconstruction, Mr.. James T. Gunn has devoted his time among his associates in the Labour movement and Trade Unionists, in endeavouring to convince them that the programme laid down by the Association was sympathetic towards labour. Mr. Gunn advocates placing soldiers upon the land, with Government, owned tractors and farm machineiy ; the creation of an organisation to secure trade with FranCe, Belgium, Serbia and Poland ; the retention of the Imperial Munitions Board to distribute such orders on the resumption of productive public works; and a further appropriation towards the construction of a Canadian Mercantile Marine.Cabinet Committee and Trade Mission. The problem of reconstruction, develop-ment and adjustment to the new conditions of industry and trade is being considered at a conference between the Reconstruction and Develoiomeut Committee of the Cabinet, headed by Mr. A. K. MacLean, and representatives of the various branches of the Canadian Manufacturers&apos; Association, especially those engaged in war industries. The main purpose of tile meeting is to create&apos;a central body, repre-sentative of manufacturers, agriculture and labour, to act in close cc-operation with the Canada Trade Mission in London.
Transportation of Troops : Railway Conference. The Minister of Railways (Mr. &apos; J. I). Reid)&apos;and the Minister of-Militia (Major-General S. C. Mewburn.), have held a conference with the Presidents of the three great Canadian Railways, viz., the Canadian Pacific, Grand Trunk and Canadian Northern Railways, to discuss the necessary arrangements for the transportation of Canadian troops from England to Canada, and thence to their homes. It was decided to form a Committee, composed of a representative of each of the three railways, to be located permanently in the capital. Associated with them will be Colonel E. E. Clarke, Director of Supply and Transport, representing the Militia Department. This Committee will have full authority to deal with the transportation question as it affects demobilisation, and will also have the duty of looking after the retirrned troops after they have landed in the Dominion.Return of Troops.  Consent has been given to the withdrawal of the Canadian troops, and the question of precedence for the returning men has been carefully gone into by a special Canadian Committee of Demobilisation, which has been working in England and Canada since 1917.After joint consideration of the military and the economic side of demobilisation, it was &quot;decided that it would be better first to return men whose trade classifications showed the immediate need of them from the industrial point of view. The question .of married, and unmarried men was also fully gone into, and preference is to be given to the married men because of their heavier responsibilities.: After consultation with the British Ministry of Shipping and the Canada War Board, the conclusion has been reached that, taking into consideration the available amount of shipping and rolling stock in the Dominion which can be used for the transport of troops, as well as the housing problem during the winter months, and the conditions governing the labour market, the rate at the beginning should not exceed 20,000 men per mcnth.Soldiers&apos; Settlement on Land : Training in Great Britain. An announcement has been made by the Minister of the Interior (Mr. A. Meighen) outlining the plans under the land settlement scheme whereby returned soldiers without agricultural experience will be given an opportunity of qualifying to go on the land. The Minister states that in the course of the demobilisation period, which will extend, over many months, a number of training farms wilf be established in Great Britain, and preliminary stej)s have been taken to this end in&apos; conjunction with the Department of Militia and the Khaki University. The farms will be organised as schools of instruction in the essentials of farming under Canadian conditions. To provide an intensive course lasting about three months, a staff is being selected from service men who were formerly engaged in agricultural training.The Minister goes on to say : &quot; Inexperienced men returning at once to Canada will be offered two plans under which they may qualify, the choice being optional. They may either gain experience by working with successful farmers, or they may take a course at an agricultural college or similar institution in the Dominion.&quot;Suspension of Military Service Act. The Government have decided to suspend the operations of the Military Service Act. Orders have been issued by the Depart-ment of Militia and Defence to disband forthwith the civil section of the Military Police. These men have been employed to apprehend defaulters and deserters, and to perform special services in connection with the Repatriation Act.The &quot; No-Strike &quot; Order. The Minister of Labour (Senator Gideon Robertson) has issued an official statement to the effect that upon his advice the Government have revoked the &quot;No-Strike&quot; Order-in-Council passed on October 11th (vide Report No. 90). The Minister says the Order was not regarded by the Government as placing any disability on the great majority of Labour organisations, and he adds that the Order was issued only for the purpose of maintaining industrial peace during the continuance of the war, and it is cancelled because it has served its purpose and is no longer necessaiy.Victory Loan. The subscriptions to the Victory Loan announced at the beginnino-of the week totalled $450,000,000. 0
Casualties during War. The Dominion casualties during the war 1 published as follows :- Killed in action -Died of wounds or disease Wounded - -Presumed dead, missing and. prisonersTotal    - -   - -   211,358NEWFOUNDLAND.Prime Ministers Visit. The Prime Minister (Mr. W. F. Lloyd) has left Newfoundland for England, and is expected to arrive about November 26th.AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH.The Pacific Islands: Parliamentary and Public Opinion. On the 11th November a Resolution Avas submitted by the Government to the Federal Parliament declaring that it is essential to the future safety and welfare of Australia that the captured German possessions in the Pacific, now occupied by Australian and New Zealand troops, should not in any circumstances be restored to Germany, and that in the consideration and determination of proposals affecting the destination of these islands, Australia should be consulted.The Resolution was unanimously- passed by the Commonwealth Senate on November 15th. In the House of Representatives &quot;the Acting Prime Minister (Mr. Watt) moved the Resolution on November 14th, and it was passed on the following day without a division.In his speech proposing the Resolution, Mr. Watt said that, notwithstanding the statement, fashionable in some quarters, that there should be &quot;no annexations,&quot; Australians,- as trustees of the future, ought, if it was impossible .to obtain true indemnity or proper reparation, to hold in pawn some territory that would help to relieve the debt of the people. But he submitted the motion on higher grounds, viz., because they sought to insure the safety of the lives of future generations in Australia. Mr. Watt then dealt with strategic considerations and stated that: &quot; The naAml advisers of the Government say that, from a strictly naval point of view, the Bismarck Archipelago and surrounding possessions, which we now hold under military occupation, constitute the strategic point of the whole of the Pacific. They advise the Government that to obtain the same degree of defence as the possession of these islands would mean (if we possibly could obtain them) would cost Australia an additional expenditure of several millions per annum. In one of these possessions there is perhaps one of the finest outlines for a naval base in the southern hemisphere. It is said by advisers of the Government that, if we were to allow these possessions to drift back to even a crippled enemy such as Germ-any might be after this war, they would still form an imminent menace. If submarine warfare is to be a feature of the future such a danger spot might practically cue off Australia from the rest of the world.&quot;. Regarding the matter of consultation on all such foreign questions, Mr. Watt said : &quot; We have a perfect right to say to the Mother Country that we desire to be consulted. This war has - brought Australia into the blood-stream of the world. That brings to us great opportunities, but it also brings boundless responsibilities, and amongst manj&quot; others will rise the question of determining what our foreign policy, to speak in popular parlance, will be with regard to those waters and those islands. Australia must be the great country for the white people of the world, and we appeal to the statesmen of the Mother Country to see that we get the chance of working out our own destiny without fear and trembling by placing the future destiny of the Pacific islands in the Peace Bond.&quot;In the course of the discussion the Leader of the Labour Opposition (Mr. Tudor) supported the motion upon the assurance that the retention of the Colonies was necessary as a defensive measure.The Natonal Federation^ Executive has passed a Resolution unanimously supporting the demand of Mr. Hughes for Australian representation at the peace6817-3a b34,877 15,457 152,779 8,245
Gconference, and enthusiastically commending his efforts to protect Australian industries and Jo safeguard Australian interests, more particularly in the Pacific. The Board of Directors of the Australian Natives Association has passed,a Resolution urging strongly that in the settlement of peace terms steps should be taken to protect the Commonwealth from the menace of enemy bases in the Southern Pacific. A number of articles are appearing in the Commonwealth Press pointing out the past indifference of Home authorities to the destinies of the Pacific Islands, and the lack of appreciation of Australian aspirations or strategic considerations which caused dissatisfaction then and which, it is declared, give rise to present-day misgivings.Return of Commonwealth Troops. The Minister of Defence (Senator Pearce) states that the Government is in communication with the Imperial Government and other Dominions and the Military Authorities regarding the return of Australian forces. The Cabinet have requested Mr. Hughes to take up the question of speedy demobilisation with the Administrative and Military Authorities in London, who will take his directions on the main principles. Consultations are proceeding on questions relating to employment for those awaiting embarkation, and a scheme for University education. The troops will return as units tinder their own officers. The battalions, regiments and batteries will be divided into halves ; the first-coming half containing as many men as possible meriting. preferential treatment according to the priority list as follows : Firstly, married soldiers, with preference according to the number of their children, length of service, and guaranteed employment in Australia ; secondly, single soldiers of long service, with guaranteed employment ; thirdly, other single men according to length of service.Expenses of Mr. Hughes and Sir J. Cook. The Acting Prime Minister (Mr. Watt) has publicly announced that the Commonwealth is now defraying the expenses of Mr. Hughes and Sir Joseph Cook in England.NEW ZEALAND.Prime Minister and Sir J. Ward. Though.no date has been fixed for the departure of the Prime Minister (Mr. Massey) and the Minister of Finance (Sir Joseph Ward), indications pointed to their being unable to leave before December 9th. Telegraphic enquiry has, however, since been made by the Governor-General of the Dominion as to whether it would be possible for a fast Australian warship to convey Mr. Massey and Sir Joseph Ward from New Zealand to San Francisco or Vancouver, so as to enable them to arrive at an earlier date in the United Kingdom. Mr. Massey has been informed that ladies Can be included in the party.South African Wool Clip. The Dominion Government were informed by telegram on November 12th that the Government of the Union of South Africa had invited an offer from the British Government for the 1918-19 wool clip, and had suggested that instead of a share in&apos; the profits from any sales, an additional 20 per cent, be added to the 55 per cent, to be paid out at the time of purchase in full and final settlement of such purchase (vide Report No. 91). The British Government pointed out that it was desirable to secure control of the South African wool clip and that they proposed to make an offer for the whole clip or a share of it on the 1918-14 basis, plus 70 per cent. The assent of the Dominion Government to this proposal Avas therefore sought.In reply the Dominion Government telegraphed on November 15th that they could not agree to the proposal as the course suggested would be unfair to the producers of the Dominion. If a further increase should be arranged, the Dominion Ministers consider it should be applicable to all wool-producing countries in the Empire.SOUTH AFRICA.Prime Minister and Sir Thomas Smartt. The Prime Minister (General Botha) is sailing for England during the present week. It is understood that the Leader of the Opposition (Sir Thomas Smartt) is accompanying him.
&quot;With regard to Sotith African representation at the Peace Conference, the Gape Times&apos;strongly urges that the Imperial Government should invite Sir Thomas Smartt, Leader of the &quot;Opposition, , to attend. It points out that despite temptation, and sometimes provocation, the Unionists have kept the transcendent issues of the war steadily in view, and on all critical occasions have co-operated with, the Ministry.. The journal argues, therefore, that it is both reasonable and fair that Sir Thomas Smartt should be invited to accompany General Botha to the Conference. De Volkstem disagrees with the idea of Sir Thomas Smartt joining General Botha and General Smuts at the Peace Conference, and declares that General Botha and General Smuts adequately represent the whole of the Union, including the English-speaking population.Interned Enemy Civilians. The Union Government have asked the British Government as to their policy regarding interned enemy civilians. It is pointed out that there are interned in South Africa about 200 Austro-Hungarians, 2,140 Germans,&apos; 6 Turks, 3 naturalised British subjects, and 156 women and children from Nyasalancl. The Union Government would like to release, after individual consideration, the naturalised British subjects unless it is contrary to the policy of the British Govern-&quot; nient, and they would also desire to release at once 400-500 of the older and more innocuous civilians who are likely to remain in the country, as an act of grace, and before an agitation for their release is started. The Union Government also enquire as to any distinctions to be made between Germans and Austro-LIungarians.  ;: .Reinforcements of Cape Coloured Men. The Union Government have inquired as to whether the draft reinforcements of Cape coloured men for the First Cape Corps and for the Cape Auxiliary Force Transport Company, who are now awaiting embarkation at Kimberley, can be discharged. The Union Ministers are strongly in favour of this course, as owing to influenza there is a shortage of labour in the western portion of Cape Colony, where most of the men come from. This shortage- is rendered serious by reason of the fact that the wheat crop is just about to ripen for harvesting, and the release of the Cape coloured men would ease the situation. There are objections, it is pointed out, to using the labour of these men while they retain the status of soldiers.Influenza in Free State : Dutch and British Sympathy. A feature of the influenza epidemic has been the manner in which co-operation in relief work has brought together the Dutch and British, particularly in the Free State Province. Mr. Merrimau, speaking at a meeting at Stellenbosch, in thanking those who had helped, mentioned an English farmer in the Free State whose home was badly stricken, the whole household being ill, until a motorist brought medicine, relief and sympathetic assistance. The farmer, Mr. Merriman stated, had previously regarded this motorist with detestation, but he now looked upon him as the most kind-hearted of men. The motorist was General Hertzog.INDIA.(Excluding External Affairs, whir-li are dealt with, in the Eastern Report.)Imperial War Cabinet Representatives. The Maharaja of Bikanir, in addition to Sir S. P. Sinha, is coming to England in connection with the forthcoming meetings of the Imperial War Cabinet.News of Armistice. The Viceroy reported to the Secretary of State for India on November 16th that the North-West Frontier was quiet and that the news of the Armistice was causing genuine enthusiasm.Proposed Indian Colony in German East Africa,. -The Secretary of State for the Colonies (Mr. Walter Long) has referred in a Memorandum to Sir T. Mo risen&apos;s proposal that German East Africa should, if possible, be reserved as a Colony for
Indians- from India. In the course of this Mr. Long points out that it is in regard to Avhether Indian colonisation would be for the benefit of the native inhabitants that the scheme should be mainly, if not entirely, judged.- In this&apos; connection the opinion of Sir II. Byatt is given, strongly deprecating the adoption of the scheme, and pointing out that to settle large numbers of Indian colonists would he impossible without infringing the rights of the natives; that native labour even before the war was a growing difficulty, and that the increased demand which would arise ultimately out of Indian settlement woti Id complicate still further a problem which will be hard to solve in any case. Sir 1:1. Byatt states that the German; policy of granting Europeans extensive tracts and forcing natives to work on them has been condemned widely as destructive of native progress, and that Indian settlement would lead eventually to similar objections, even if natives were only employed in transporting produce. With, regard to the proposed employment of native Indians to administer the country, he expresses the conviction,- based on long observation of the relations between the two races, that it would fail for the- reason that Africans regard Indians generally with no respect.A former Governor of the. Protectorate is also quoted iri this memorandum as follows With the construction of the Uganda Railway large numbers of Indian coolies were imported a fact ever to be regretted. They were of low caste ; many remained&apos;, but have not taken up agriculture. The hulk have become traders and have given a low commercial tone to the Avhole up-country, and had the worst of influences on the vast native populations with which they have come in contact.&quot;Indians and German Rule in East Africa. The Aga Ivhan. has asked that the following message may be forwarded to the President of the Ismailia Council at Zanzibar : &quot;You-all know how terribly my people have suffered when the Germans-ruled East Africa, also how terribly other Indians suffered. Shortly the Peace Congress must decide the fate of German East Africa and also the happiness of Indian settlers in that country. Under these circumstances you and my people throughout East Africa, specially in German parts, should unite with other Indians, hold meetings in every part of East Africa, and send through the proper authorities telegrams to be seen by Foreign Office, India Office, begging England not to give you back to German cruelty. This telegram is only for the Council and not to be published ; show it to Resident and Governor. -Aga Khan.&quot;
