BRITISH  EMPIRE   AND   AFRICA  REPORT.IMPERIAL AFFAIRS.British Empire Delegation. At a meeting of the British Empire Delegation held on April 23rd (B.E.D. 28) clauses relating to the German colonies for insertion in the Preliminaries of Peace were considered. It was agreed inter alia that for the purpose of Section ..., Part I. (commercial relations), and Part IV. (property rights and interests) territory which is ceded by Germany to the. Allied and Associated Powers, and of which the government is entrusted by them to a mandatory, shall be treated in all respects as if it were the property of an Allied or Associated Power. It was also agreed that movable and immovable property in such territory belonging to Germany should pass to the mandatory in the same manner as such property passes in the case of territory ceded, to an Allied or Associated Power.At the above, meeting it was also agreed that the terms of the various mandates should be drafted and an early opportunity given the Delegation for their discussion.Amongst other subjects discussed at the meeting were : the property of enemy missions ; the passage of Allied aircraft over territory of enemy countries ; the draft Convention for the control of the arms traffic ; the covenant of the League of Nations, &amp;c.Withdrawal of Commercial Black Lists. The Dominion Governments have been informed that it has been decided by the Allied and Associated Governments to with-draw all black lists as from April 28th. In consequence, all disabilities attaching to trading or communication with those on such, lists will cease to operate on the date mentioned.   The right to reintroduce black lists is reserved.SELF-GOVERNING   DOMINIONS.CANADA.By-Electzons: Government Policy. In the House of Commons last week the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. D. D. Mackenzie) pointed out that five constituencies were vacant, and asked when the Government proposed to issue writs in respect of them.-The Acting Prime Minister (Sir Thomas White) replied that it was not the intention of the Government to hold any by-elections until all the soldiers had returned. The Government meant the soldiers to have an opportunity of voting if. the elections took place in their ridings. The matter would. therefore not be cleter-mined until demobilisation was complete.Proposed Third Party. The Great War Veterans&apos; Association, at the annual convention at Moose Jaw, declined to be drawn into politics. A resolution proposed an amalgamation of Veterans, Grain Growers, and Labourites to form a third political party, but the President declared it to be out of order. The Veterans, he said, being a non-political association, could not discuss such a matter at the convention.Expedition to Siberia: Liberal Criticism. In a recent speech at Toronto, Dr. Beland,.who was Postmaster-General in Sir W. LauriePs Cabinet, and who was a prisoner in Germany during the war, discussed the expedition to Siberia. In the course of his remarks, he said : &quot; Although it has been realised that a mistake was made, General Mewburn and Mr. Rowell attempted recently in the House of Commons to explain that the expedition had been undertaken at the request of the Imperial War Cabinet. One of two things, therefore, happened. Either the representatives of Canada in the Imperial War Cabinet assented or dissented.   If they assented they went contrary
to the general will of the population of Canada, and if they dissented they were outvoted, and in this case what becomes of.the autonomy of Canadians? It is a question of 4,000 or 5,000 men, but the number does not come into consideration here. When Canada was never consulted and was against this movement, not a soldier, willing or unwilling, should have been sent to Eastern Asia.&quot;Hereditary Titles. It is announced  in the Press that a Committee of the Dominion House of Commons have decided to report that hereditary titles in Canada should cease on the death of the present holders.   There was a strong feeling in &quot;favour of not interfering with, the award of titles for military services.Prohibition in Quebec, Official figures give the total vote in the referendum in Quebec on the sale of wine and beer as 178,112 for and 18,433 against. It is admitted that the result has been greatly influenced by the Labour organisations. The voting was also affected by the determination of the Roman Catholic Church to be neutral.Liquor licences expire in Quebec on May 1st.Overseas Units and. Dominion Militia. A Committee has been appointed to investigate and report on the absorption of the units of the Overseas Forces into the Canadian Militia in order to preserve their identity and traditions.Railway Nationalisation. The matter of the National Railways again occupied the attention of the House of Commons last week. Chief interest centred around the speech of the Acting Premier (Sir Thomas White), who declared that the policy of the Government on the question of the nationalisation of the railroads was unassailable. Sir T. White said that the Government were confronted with two alternatives both in 1917 and now. They must either acquire certain railways from time to time, and undertake honest competition with the remaining great Canadian system, or in the course of time there would be only one great privately-owned system operating all the railways in the Dominion. With regard to the latter alternative, undoubtedly such a system could operate, but the people of Canada would never stand such a privately-owned combine. The policy the Government had adopted was one of optimism, and Called for unity in the work of. reconstruction. If Canada was to grow and become a great nation, then Parliament must regard the future with faith, hope and courage.Dr. Michael Clark (U., Red Deer) pointed out that it was possible for Canada to produce 1,000,000,000 acres of wheat if railroads were available to carry the grain out of the country.Shipbuilding Industry. The S.S. Canadian Range)-, an 8,10U ton&apos;steel steamer built to the order of the Dominion Government, has been successfully launched at the Maisonneuve yard of the Canadian vickers Company, Limited. The Canadian Minister of Marine (Mr. Ballantyne), who was present at the launching, stated that, although the shipbuilding industry was at present in its infancy in Canada, it yet provided work for 25,000 men, at.the same time giving industrial activity generally an impetus which could not be overestimated.Manufactures for European Countries. The Dominion Minister of Immigration and Colonisation reports that Canadian agricultural implement manufacturers have secured orders for France and Rumania to the value of over 2,000,000 dollars. Scandinavian countries are also in the market for Canadian implements. The conditions in this trade are most promising, and steps towards greater intimacy in industrial relations are being made in several fields by Canadian industry.Commercial Aviation. -The Western Canada Aeroplane Company, with a capital of $100,000, has been organised. The company has been formed for the purpose of putting flying in the AVest on a commercial basis. An aviation school will be formed, and a site for an aerodrome has been selected in Portage Avenue West.AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH.Peace Celebrations.-The Commonwealth Government have decided to limit the Peace celebrations to two clays, one of which shall be a Sunday.Labour Policy : Victorian Conference. Resolutions were passed by the Victorian Labour Conference on April 21st, according to announcements appearing in the799i-la A 2
Press, in favour of the extension of the franchise to the age of 18 and the nationalisa-tion of insurance, banks and shipping. These will become recommendations to the annual Federal Labour Conference which will meet shortly to frame the Australian Labour Party&apos;s fighting platform.Labour and Cabinet Government. At the Conference of the Victorian branch of the Australian Labour Party it was resolved that if a Labour majority were obtained the system of Cabinet Government should be modified, the administration of each department to include five committeemen elected by caucus.Number of Returned Soldiers. Ine Minister of Repatriation (Senator Millen) has announced that 114,592 men had returned to the Commonwealth up to the end of February.Repatriated Germans. The first shipment of German internees who are being repatriated from Australia will probably leave at the end of May. This shipment consists mainly of those not formerly resident in Australia, including the crews of captured ships and others transferred to Australia from the East. Special magistrates are being provided to hear appeals against the repatriation of aliens who previously to the war were resident in Australia.SOUTH AFRICA.Naval Contribution. In the course of the debate on the Defence Vote in the House of Assembly (vide Report No. 116) the Minister of Railways and Harbours (Mr. Burton) said that the Union had contributed to the Navy not on account of the financial assistance afforded-by the contribution, which was very small compared with that of the other Dominions, but from the same, motive which actuated the Cape&apos;s original contribution, namely, in acknowledgment of the Navy&apos;s protection and as a point of honour. Personally, he said, he did not particularly&apos;like the present form of the contribution ; nevertheless he considered it to be the duty of the Union to take a larger share of the burden of naval defence. The motion to delete the paragraph providing for a naval contribution of 85,000/.. was rejected by 60 votes to 16.South Africa,&apos;s Status: signing Peace Treaty. In the course of the speech referred to in the preceding paragraph,. Mr. Burton said that the Nationalists wanted to secure South Africa&apos;s independence, but they woidd not achieve this by sending deputations on a wild goose chase. South Africans status, however, was nearer independence to-day than ever before, through the efforts of the Dominions&apos; repre-sentatives in Europe. Such independence within the Empire was the only inde-pendence South Africa was likely to achieve for many years. Mr. Burton pointed out that the South African representatives would sign the Peace Treaty as such) not as representatives of the British Empire.Nationalists and Absent Ministers. In the Union Etouse of Assembly on April loth a number of motions were adopted granting leave of absence to various members, including General Botha, General Smuts, Sir Percy Fitzpatrick, and Mr. Feetham. The Nationalists strongly opposed the granting of leave of absence to General Botha and General Smuts. The Acting Premier (Mr. Malan) warmly defended General Smuts, whom, he said, the Nationalists should thank, as being the man who drafted the League of Nations Covenant, which, as one of President Wilson&apos;s fourteen points, had received the Nationalists&apos; support.Sir Percy Fitzpatrick&apos;s advocacy of land settlement in South Africa was also criticised by the Nationalists. \Government Fleet of Ships.- Speaking in the Union House of Assembly on April 24th in Committee of Supply, Mr. Boydell, the Labour Member, drew attention to the recent.statement of the Minister of Railways and Harbours (Mr. Burton), to&quot; the effect that the Australian Government had profiteered in connection with shipping (vide Report No. 113). Mr. Boydell declared that Australian freights were the same as those laid down by the British Shipping Controller, whereupon Mr. Burton replied that his statement was based on official information and was made in perfect good faith.   The matter, he added, was being investigated.
INDIA.Riots.The Viceroy has reported to the India Office as follows : Punjab. Telegrams dated April 24th and April 27th stated that all was quiet in Lahore and Amritsar. Loot from the last-named place was said to have been found in remote villages in Jullundur and Lyallpur. Martial law had been proclaimed in Lyallpur in durbar ; a movable column and armoured train were operating in the district. Gross exaggerations were being made regarding punishments imposed. In Lahore, civil area, 28 persons had been dealt with by courts-martial since the proclamation - of martial law. Of these, 5 were discharged,.! found insane, .2 remanded for further enquiry, and 12 sentenced to flogging; in addition 8 had been fined. The men flogged were, with one exception, petty shopkeepers of the servant class.. Charges in five cases were of tearing down notices, and&quot; in seven of being out after hours.Telegrams of April 25th and 26th reported that Lahore and Amritsar were still quiet. In Jullundur arrests had been made in connection with attacks on Amritsar banks. A telegram of April 29th reported that at Lahore, in the case of serious assault on C.I.D. inspector, nine persons were sentenced to transportation, for life.United Provinces. -A telegram of April 24th stated that local agitators were still active in Meerut ; nothing was reported from elsewhere.north-West Frontier Province. A telegram of April 28th reported that the situation was quiet in Peshawar and throughout the Province.Telegrams of April 28th and 29th showed that all was quiet at Delhi, Bombay, Ahmeclabad, &amp;c.Famine.The Viceroy reported on April 25th that famine was being declared in Mandla District, Central Provinces. Distress had disappeared in Saugor, and the situation was much easier in Jubbulpore. The number on works in most districts of Central Provinces had been reduced hy the labourers going to gather mahua crop and immigrants returning home in United Provinces. Distress was still acute in Etawah, bus elsewhere slight. The number on works was increasing in Bombay Presidency. Test works started in Kistna District, Madras Presidency. The numbers relieved were : Bengal: District Board works, 4,280 ; gratuitous relief, 7,186. Bihar and Orissa : test works, 4,352 ; gratuitous relief, 6,001. Feudatory States, Orissa : test works, 14,249; gratuitous relief, 10,313. United Provinces: test works, 13,868; gratuitous relief, 13,074. Rajputana : relief works, 689 ; test works, 3,860 ; gratuitous relief, 160. Ajmer-Merwara : test works, 21 ; gratuitous relief, 564. Central India : relief works, 12,845 ; gratuitous relief, 7,255. - Central Provinces : relief works, 71,491; test works, 24,720 ; gratuitous relief, 34,770. Bombay: relief works, 68,833 ; village works, 3,943 ; tests works, 3,663 ; gratuitous relief, 82,977. Madras : relief works, 6,617 ; test works, 351 ; gratuitous relief, 29,158.OTHER COLONIES, PROTECTORATES, &amp;c.EGYPT.Development of the Situation. The Proclamation issued by General Allenby on April 22nd, ordering Government officials to return to their posts has produced a good effect. A large number returned on the 23rd, and since then the situation has continued to improve. For a time the railway workmen were reported to be hanging back, but a telegram dated 27th states that they are now returning. The Police Cadets rejoined on the 26th.There have been no further disturbances in the country and the efforts of agitators to prevent officials from returning have failed largely, it would seem, owing to the arrest of ringleaders.
The Ministry, as reported last week, have resigned, hut this does not appear to have had any adverse influence on the situation. General Allenby thinks that some time may elapse before suitable Ministers. can be found. In the meantime, British heads of Departments will carry on under his.authority backed by martial law.The Egyptian Nationalist Delegation have not been idle in Paris. The Humanite publishes an interview with Zaghlul Pasha in which he comments on the dissatis-faction aroused in Egypt at the declaration of the Protectorate in 1914. He asserts that leading Egyptians kept this discontent under control during the war. He lays great stress on the unity of Copts and Moslems, ridicules any suggestion of connivance with Turks and Germans, and states that there is no truth in the accusation of Xenophobia brought against Egyptians.(The sacking of Coptic shops in Assiout, organised destruction of communications which closely followed the plans which the Germans are known to have made, murder of Armenians, and attacks on Greeks, to say nothing of the butchery of British officers and men, scarceky seem to support the Pasha&apos;s contentions.)The Humanite describes Zaghloks declaration as &quot; moderate,&quot; and says that the British have pitilessly repressed Egyptian manifestations.(The Egyptian Budget for 1919-20 provides  E. 1,000,000 towards making good the damage which these manifestations have caused.)The Governor-General of the Sudan reports that the leading notables of the Sudan have suggested that a party representative of official, administrative, and religious leaders should proceed to London on behalf of the Sudan to present con-gratulations to the King on the occasion of the signing of the Treaty of Peace. They would take this opportunity of expressing their contentment under British rule. The Governor-General considers that this would have a reassuring effect in the Sudan where there is apprehension that a realisation of Egyptian aspirations might lead to an increase of Egyptian influence in the Sudan. A telegram has been sent in reply togsay that His Majesty V Government will be glad to welcome the party from the Sudan and that all necessary arrangements for their accommodation and entertainment will be made.RHODESIA.Position in Southern Rhodesia. The Legislative Council of Rhodesia assembled on April 25th. The Administrator (Sir Drummond Chaplin), in his opening address, said that in spite of the absence of many Rhoclesians at the war and of the influenza epidemic, the industries were well maintained, the labour supply steadily improving, and the general prosperity indeed greater than before the war. He foreshadowed an appreciable increase in the expenditure, which would be met by the re-enactment of a portion of the taxation measures passed during the last two years. The Adminis-trator said that he had no information as to the intentions of the Imx^erial Government with regard to the Chartered Company&apos;s claim for reimbursement from the Imperial Government in respect of administrative deficits. One result of the decision in the land case was that expenditure on public works, which would otherwise have naturally *heen defrayed out of loan funds, had been rendered increasingly difficult.
