BRITISH   EMPIRE   AND   AFRICA   REPORT.IMPERIAL AFFAIRS.Imperial Wireless Communications. Tiie Secretary of State for the Colonies (Lord Milner) has prepared a Memorandum for the War Cabinet (G.T. 7843), dated July 30th, 1919, in which it is pointed out that an urgent decision is required upon the question of Imperial Wireless Communications. Though approved in principle years ago and a contract given to tbe Marconi Company, it is recalled that differences between the Company and the Post Office prevented the contract from being carried out. Since then the war has both prevented further action being taken for five years and has produced a revolutionary development in the science of wireless telegraphy, particularly regarding results in long-range communication.It is further pointed out that the Government of the Commonwealth of Australia-have decided that their Imperial station shall be constructed and owned by the State ; and that the Wireless Sub-Committee of the Imperial Communications Committee (representative of the three fighting services and the Chief Departments of State) have unanimously reported in favour of an Imperial wireless &quot;system constructed, controlled, and operated by the State, and as a beginning recommended the completion on the Poulsen system of the Oxford and Cairo stations. The latter proposal is now being carried out by the Post Office, and these two stations will form a small but important part of any general Imperial system.The Secretary of State therefore suggests as tbe next step that a new Sub-Committee of the Imperial Communications Committee should be appointed in order to prepare a complete scheme of Imperial Wireless Communication in the light of modern wireless science and Imperial needs.In this connection, attention is called to a memorandum by Mr. Hughes, written before his departure for Australia. (G.T. No. 7842), in which the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth stated that an important element in the linking up of Empire commu-nications is the establishment of a complete chain of wireless services for direct -communication between the several British Dominions. Such services would be controlled by the Governments of the different parts of the Empire in which stations were established. They would be valuable for trade purposes especially in relation to shipping and would be invaluable in case of war, when other services, cable and wireless, might not be available. Therefore Mr. Hughes submitted that the completion of an &quot; All Peel &quot; wireless system encircling the world should certainly be taken in hand at once.Exclusion of ex-Enemy Subjects. With reference to the proposal that Colonies and Protectorates should be invited to pass legislation under which the local govern-ment would have a free hand to exclude for three years any subject of a State lately at war with His Majesty, the President of the Board of Trade (Sir A. Geddes) has submitted a memorandum to the War Cabinet urging that such legislation is only free from objection, if confined to persons who remain subjects of ex-enemy States. Under the Treaty of Peace, it is pointed out, a number of Germans and Austrians will&apos; acquire Polish and Czecho-Slovakian nationality, and it will be necessary to recognise this new nationality and not to pass any legislation which would exclude such persons.SELF-GOVERNING   DOMINIONS.CANADA.Peace Treaty : Special Session of Parliament.-A special session of the Dominion Parliament for the purpose of ratifying the Peace Treaty has been summoned for September 1st.Cabinet Changes. Sir Henry Drayton, Chairman of the Railway Commission, was sworn in on August 2nd at Ottawa as Minister of Finance in succession to Sir Thomas White.   The Minister of Public Works (Mr. F. B. Carvellj has resigned, and has been
appointed Chairman of the Railway Commission. It is understood that Dr. S. F. Tolmie (Member for Victoria) will become Minister of Agriculture in succession to Mr. Crerar.Labour and &quot; One Big Union&quot; Movement. Eleven Labour Unions of Winnipeg-have been reorganised in affiliation with the Dominiou Trades and Labour Council. This, it is publicly announced, will give the Internationals 40 Winnipeg delegates at the Trades Congress in September.The other Winnipeg unions are reconsidering their position, and the &quot; One Big-Union &quot; idea is stated to be losing support.The charter of District No. 18 of the United Mine Workers of America has been revoked. This affects 8,000 miners who have been striking in Alberta and Eastern British Columbia since June 24th. The charter is revoked because the President, Vice-President, and Secretary of District No. 18 are connected with the &quot; One Big-Union &quot; movement.Many Labour organisations in Nova Scotia are petitioning the executive of the Nova Scotia Federation of Labour for a special convention to consider an eight-hour day and its enforcement, direct legislative representation, and general industrial conditions. The emissaries of the &quot;One Big Union&quot; are said to be finding little support in industrial centres in Ontario and Quebec.The executive of the Sydney (Nova Scotia) miners have sent Sir Robert Borden a message practically refusing to send representatives to the industrial conference in September owing to the domination of the Conservative element, represented by Senator Robertson, Minister of Labour, and Mr. Moore, President of the Trades. Congress. All over the Dominion the breach between the International and the &quot; One Big Union &quot; is said to be becoming more definite and acute.Aims of &quot;One Big Union&quot; Advocates.-Giving evidence at the preliminary hearing at Winnipeg of the trial of eight Labour leaders charged with seditious conspiracy, Mr. A. E. Davis, of Minneapolis, recalled a speech made by Mr. Evens, one of the strike leaders, the day after the&apos; strike began. The witness said that Ivens declared from the platform that the Strike Committee had control of the police, the firemen, telephones, street cars, food, and particularly bread and milk. They also intended to restrict the use of telegraphs and to suppress the newspapers, stop&apos; mail deliveries, and control water works.   He said :  .&quot; Parliament is now in the Labour Temple instead of the City Hall. If you but stand firm, in a short time the employers will be brought cringing on their knees and saying, &apos; What shall we do to be saved? &apos; The storm is about to break, and this time the lightning will strike upward instead of downward. Some of our brothers are talking about raising money for building a new Labour Temple. I think the Parliament Buildings will make a good Labour Temple, and from the way things are going we shall soon move in.&quot;The witness judged from Ivens&apos; speech that Winnipeg was practically under Soviet control.National Liberal Convention. The Liberal Convention opened at Ottawa on August 5th. Amongst the chief business will be the selection of a permanent leader of the Party in succession to Sir Wilfrid Laurier and the adoption of a Party programme in connection with the Tariff and other matters. The Premier of Nova Scotia (Mr. Murray) and the Premier of Quebec (Sir Lomer Gouin) were elected joint Chairmen of the Convention. Mr. Murray pleaded for unity in the Liberal Party. He stated that the usefulness of the Union Government had gone, and that its perpetuation would require continual compromise and would tend to unstable govern-ment.   Mr. Murray asked the Convention to drop their differences over conscription.Nationality, cfcc. of Settlers entering the Dominion. According to the figures given out by the Winnipeg Branch of the Department of Immigration, during the month of Mav 1919 there entered Canada from the United States, 2,102 persons, with total wealth&apos; of $1,026,021 ; effects, $171,312. The figures for 191S were &quot;2,070 persons; wealth, 8966,279; effects, S 143,645. Other details of the 1919 figures were as follows : Nationality.

The nationality of those who made entry was as follows: British, 60; Canadian, 72; American, 38 ; French, 6; Scandinavian, 5; other Europeans, 10 ; not stated, 51.Certificates of Origin of Belgian Goods. Following the example of the British Government, the Dominion Government have decided not to require certificates of origin in respect of Belgian goods imported into the Dominion. The Order in Council dealing with the matter was passed on July 1st.Abolition of Titles.-Mr. W. F. Niekle, M.F., who was the leader of the movement for the abolition of titles in Canada, has resigned his seat in the Dominion Parliament.AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH. .Prime Minister in South Africa. -It was reported from Cape Town on July 31st that the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth (Mr. W. M. Hughes) had arrived on board HALT. Friedrichsruh. and would be the guest, of General Botha. It was expected the vessel would only make a brief stay.Labour Troubles. It is reported from Melbourne that the seamen&apos;s strike is now entering its twelfth week, and prospects of a settlement are remote. The President of the Seamen*s Union (Mr. Lecornu) has cabled asking American seamen to isolate Australia until all the strikers&apos; demands have been granted.The Secretary of the Australian SeameiFs Union (Mr. Walsh), who is serving a term of three months&apos; imprisonment, is hunger-striking. The seamen state that they are ready to stay out for six months.The collieries having refused to supply a list of existing prices, the Queensland Government are appointing a commission to investigate the condition of the industry. The Minister of Railways (Mr. Fihelly) has declared that if the proprietors decline to deliver supplies, the Government will take what they want.The Sydney Labour Council have sent a message to the meat strikers at Towns-ville recommending them to meet the armed forces of capitalism on an equal footing.New Parly of Labour Extremists. It is reported from Sydney that 200 labour extremists, after holding a conference, have formed a new party with the object of establishing a co-operative Commonwealth, in which the organised industrial workers will own and control the entire means of wealth and production.Purchase of Ships : Debate in Parliament.   On a motion to extend the time for the debate in the Commonwealth Parliament on the purchase of ships without the prior approval of Parliament the Government only obtained a majority of two, eight of their supporters voting against them.Secret Commissions and Profiteers : Stcde Governors. The Queensland Parlia-ment is considering a Bill to prohibit the payment of secret commissions and also a Bill to prevent profiteering. It is announced in the Press that a pixrposal is on foot to make representations to the Imperial authorities in favour of the abolition of the office of State Governor.Trade Returns. Australian exxDorts for the past year amounted to 112,50 0,000L and imports to 98,750.000/,NEW ZEALAND.Arrival of Prime Minister and Sir J. Ward.-The Prime Minister (Mr. Massey) and Minister of Finance (Sir Joseph Ward) have arrived in New Zealand.Demands of Miners.- It is reported from Wellington that a conference of representatives of&apos; the Goalmine&quot;Owners&apos; Association and the Miners&apos;Federation has^ opened to consider the miners&apos; demands, including  the abolition of the contract system and the fixing of the hours from bank to bank at seven immediately and six after 1920, with wages at 11. a day.SOUTH AFRICA.General Smuts at Gape Town. General Smuts arrived at Cape Town on August 4th on board the Edinburgh Castle and received a splendid reception at the docks and also from the large crowds in the streets on the way to the City Hall.   The arrangements
made for welcoming General Smuts were identical with those carried out on the occasion of General 13otha&apos;s arrival last month.Replying to a number of addresses of welcome General Smuts paid an eloquent tribute to the reputation and services of the South African Brigade, whose dead, he said, called from the grave on the South Africans to stand together for the future and -to build up South Africa in the spirit in which they had fought and died.Referring to his work in Europe, General Smuts described the condition of Central Europe, questioning whether the organism of civilisation had not been destroyed. He reiterated the necessity for a more humane spirit among the nations of the world, laying down as an axiom : &quot; Give freedom and self-government. Be generous. Be magnanimous.&quot; Otherwise, he added, it would be impossible to heal the wounds of the world. The only thing to save Europe was not Peace Treaties and territorial settlements, but a better and more generous spirit. He quoted in support of his argument the settlement of South Africa after the Boer War, when Great Britain gave freedom and self-government, resulting in a wave of optimism. The result of Great Britaiifs act was one of the most marvellous creations of statesmanship. A more generous spirit could only be achieved by bringing together the broken family of Europe into the League of Nations which was a great instrument for the progress and union of the human race.General Smuts quoted Miss CavelPs saying on the eve of her murder : &quot; Patriotism is not enough.&quot; He maintained that the phrase aptly summarised the true essence of the war. The world had outgrown the boundaries of patriotism. They had reached the stage when they must look beyond their boundaries. He and General Botha had always preached in England the idea of the Empire as a league of equal and indepen-clent States. The old idea of Imperialism would mean the break-up of the British Empire. The League of Nations embodied the same idea. If they wanted to do their best for South Africa, they must look further than South Africa. They were now part of the large world, and no longer an obscure British Colony.Return of Nationalist Delegation.-The South African Nationalist Deputation to Holland (including General Hertzog) are returning to South Africa by the S.S. Oranje and Prince cle Nederlander, bound for Batavia. It is expected that the delegates may tranship at Singapore to other vessels bound for Batavia.Indian Congress at Johannesburg. At a meeting of the Indian Congress, held at Johannesburg on August 4th, the President said that the position of Indians in South Africa had steadily descended from bad to worse, and that Indian competition in business was to be eliminated. &quot; When that was accomplished,&quot; continued the President, &quot; Indians could remain as menials or drag themselves back to India.&quot; They were, therefore, he added, confronted with a stern fight, and all their determi-nation, resolve, and&apos; capacity for sacrifice would be needed to recover their lost position, unless they were finally to lose the last vestige of their self-respect.Loic-Grade Mines : Suggested Relaxation of Colour Bar. The Commission on the Gold. Industry which was formed for the purpose of seeking a solution of the problems of low-grade mines and labour conditions has recently taken a quantity of evidence from representatives of various interests. The Chamber of Mines sub-mitted a statement on August 1st in favour of the relaxation of the colour bar by which natives may be employed as leading hands assisting Europeans ancl in other ways given scope for promotion. It believes that by this means a larger number of South African natives would be attracted to the Witwatersrancl and native labour would be utilised to greater advantage, while the reduction in the field of European employment, which is at present threatened through certain mines no longer paying, would be avoided.INDIA.Monsoon and Economic Situation : Relief of Distress. The Viceroy telegraphed to the India Office on July 31st that the monsoon was late in reaching parts of Madras, Bombay Dec-can, United Provinces, Rajputana ancl South-and West Punjab, but it had recently been abundant ancl was now generally satisfactory throughout India. Consequently, despite some delay in agricultural operations in the above&apos; areas, the sowing of autumn crops was proceeding well.   The young crops were
-flourishing and the agricultural outlook was good. Prices were abnormally high everywhere and were still rising in Madras and Bengal, but, were showing a tendency to fall in Bombay, the Central Provinces and Bihar. The demand for Burma rice and Australian wheat was slackening. The economic situation was poor in Madras and Bengal, but generally speaking tke wkole country had shown remarkable stavino-power, in spite of the extraordinary high level of food prices. High wages,&quot; the control of food grains, the supply and provision of standard cloth had helped to mitigate hardships due to high prices and failure of last year s monsoon.The Viceroy telegraphed to the India Office on August 1st that-distress was generally decreasing. The village works had been closed in the Kaira and Broach districts of the Bombay Presidency.The numbers relieved were as follows: Bengal: relief works, 5,140; test works, 641 ; gratuitous relief, 20,838. Bihar and Orissa : relief works, 2,259 ; test works, 3,418; gratuitous relief, 27,898. Feudatory States of Orissa : test works,. 6,333 ; gratuitous relief, 16,221. United Provinces : test works, 2,881 ; gratuitous .relief, 20,625. Rajputana : figures not reported. Ajmer Merwara : test works, 175 ; gratuitous relief, 32. Central India : relief works, 7,500 ; gratuitous relief, 10,536.. Central Provinces: relief works, 14,720: test works, 9,042; gratuitous relief, 45,142. * Bombay : relief works, 22,510; dependents, 13,426 ; village and test works, figures not received ; gratuitous relief, 87,799. Hyderabad report not received. Madras: relief works, 38,017 ; test works, 2,007; gratuitous- relief (incomplete figures), 87,611.Political Delegates. A number of delegates representing the Indian National Congress and the Home Rule Peague and other political organisations sailed for England on August 2nd. Among them, were two Indian lady delegates, whose mission is to urge the inclusion of woman franchise in the Government of India BilkSir Chettur Sankaran Nair, late member of the Viceroy&apos;s Executive Council, also sailed on August 2nd.Asiatic Trading in South Africa. Sir George Barnes, member of the Viceroy&apos;s Council, in a letter to Mr. Gandhi, refers to the anxiety caused to the Viqeroy and himself by the new legislation regarding Asiatic traders in South Africa. Sir George Barnes says: &quot;The present position is that all vested rights have been validated beyond dispute, but-the bad side of the new.Act, from the Indian point of view, is &quot;that the growth of new vested rights is stopped. This is greatly to be regretted. The protests of the Government of India against this measure have been unavailing, and we are now awaiting the receipt of the full text of the new statute. We shall then consider anxiously what further action should be taken.&quot;
