His Britannic Majesty^ Government.)A W/Q28,DEPARTMENT OP INK)RMATIONINTELLIGENCE BUREAU.WEEKLYREPORTONGERMANY.14 November, 1917.1.      Amid all our anxieties and perplexities it is easily forgotten that the enemy has his own.     In former reports it was noted that the German offensives at Riga and the islands did not produoe a very reassuring effect upon German public opinion, which seemed to fear the danger of commitments beyond Germany^ military strength and her political and economic resources.    The great military significance of the terrible blow dealt to Italy and the Allies is not ignored by the public in Germany;   but one acute observer, a woman, who in Naumann&apos;s Die Hilfe publishes a remarkably interesting diary of daily impressions of the war, could write a fortnight ago that on a railway journey she found poople talking more about the Ohan-cellor crisis than about the Isonzo front.     It is hardly too muoh to say that oven a victory like that over the Italians is now regarded by the bulk of the German people, firstly, of course, in what they may think to be its bearings upon the aate of peace, but, secondly, and before all else, in its bearings upon the internal political and economic future of Germany herself.    There is certainly satisfaction at the feat of the allied armies and at the punishment of Italy as a &quot;faithless Ally&quot;.    But among the sections of opinion which are taking the lead in the domestic political crisis, there is a haunting fear lest the triumph of the Kaiser and the Army may stiffen them into an attitude of resistance to the political emanoipa-tion of Germany, which seemed to have so favourably begun.
- -2.      As to those military consequences of the victory which are capable of being exploited for the benefit of public opinion in Germany, they are no doubt made the most of.     If, says the Frankfurter Zeitung in a leading article, all the European fronts are to be considered as forming one continuous front, the decision at one point must influence the whole line. And   it adds contemptuously, &quot;except perhaps the Eastern front, which is practically of no further importance&quot;.    The article then tries to make out that the position of Sarrailfs iarmy will be seriously affected, since the U-boat campaign makes oommuni-cations through tho Mediterranean most unsafe, while the pres-ence of the Austro-German&apos;troops in Upper Italy seriously en-dangers communications by way of Prance, Italy and the Straits of Otranto.     All the railways in Upper Italy will be wanted for transport and the reinforcement of French and English troops sent in aid of Italy.   The much-heralded despatch of French and British troops from the Western front is regarded as so much bluff or as an &quot;opiate&quot; to Italy.    And then follows a sentence in the Frankfurter1s article, which is signifioant; it attributes to Prance and England the following calculation:&quot;Somewhere or other the Central Powers must stop, of their own will doubtless;   for to incur the burden of further ooru-paticns of large territories is probably not contemplated in their military plans.     Wherever they stop, we ahall take the credit of having saved Italy, as Jcxfre, by starting the war of position after the battle of the Marne, saved France.&quot;This and similar articles are naturally written with a view totheir offeot upon foreign as well as home opinion.A Berlin telegram to a journal in Western Germanycalls attention to some very serious eEonomio aspects of theinvasion.     It points out that Friuli and the Venetian Plain areboth important agricultural districts and that the loss of thornwill be a severe blew to Italy, now that food is so scarce.The industrial districts of Lombardy, it says, were fed from
those iistriots - a statement which can he true only in part. Venice itself, it is added, is by no means safe, and, during the war, Venice has become an important industrial centre.     The advance of the Central Powers may thus be described as an attaek on the sinews and nerves of ItalyTs most productive regions.3.      These military and economic considerations may very well divert the attention of the Allies from the internal state of Germany, but they do not divert from it the attention of the Germans themselves.     It cannot be too emphatically repeated that political events of immense import are taking place and will in all probability continue to take place in Germany. As explained in the last report, the Miohaelis crisis was a very grave one, and the appointment of Count Hertling to sucoeed him has been attended and followed by further complications. Tho incompetence of Miohaelis as Chancellor was nowhere ezhibit-ed more fatally than in his failure to retain the (qualified) support of the Majority Socialists for the Government.     And it is now acknowledged in all reasonable quarters that it is essen-tial to retain the support of the Majority Socialists if the working-classes, especially those who are working at munitions and in other war services, are not to break loose and cause irremediable confusion and di3ord3r.     Besides, as was brought out in Beveral of the speeches at the recent Majority Socialist Conference at Wurzburg, the leaders of the Party, both in the Reichstag and in the constituencies, are in constant corres-pondence with the men at the front.     The men who are fighting are determined that they will not continue to give their lives or their health for the perpetuation of the old regime In Germany.     The politicians of all parties know this, and the wiser ones are exerting themselves to get political and social reforms advanced as far as possible before the end of the war
and -the return of the people-in-arms.The Majority Socialists have entirely abandoned the old policy of isolation from other parties of the Left.    They have announced that, while they want the Governments of the Empire and of Prussia to be more and more &quot;parliamentarised&quot; -i.9. to be composed of men taken from the parties composing the old parliamentary Majority and not from the ranks of the officials - they themselves are not yet prepared to join any Government.    They will be satisfied to get guarantees for progressive legislation and for the polioy of the Reichstag Majority by the admission to the Government of leading members of the Radical or Progressive Party of which Priedrioh von Payer, a lurttemberger, a man of seyenty years of age, is the veteran leader.    They also welcomed the proposal to appoint Rerr Priedberg, the leader of the (Liberal-Conservative) National Liberals in the Prussian Chamber to the position of vioe-President of the Prussian Ministry.     Frie&amp;berg is a Prussian by birth and it was considered indispensable that if Hortling, a Bavarian^, waB to be President of the Prussian Ministry, &amp; Prussian, and at the same time a supporter of Prussian franchise reform, should be appointed to represent and assist him in the Prussian Chamber.   The strongest party in the Chamber is the eld Prussian Conservative Party.   If they aocept the yrancbise Bill at all, they will do so with a wry face, and they would find still greater difficulty in accepting it from the hands of a Bavarian as Prussian Prime Minister - a thing without a parallel since the days when Stein oame from Hassan to initiate the reform of the old Prussian system of Government. In addition to flriedberg^ appointment, the Sooialists and the(1)   &quot;i. Bavarian&quot; by adoption, though a Hessian by birth; since Uov.8, after his appointment aB Prussian Minister-Presi-dent, a Prussian.
Radical Progressives wanted a Radical to be in the Prussian Ministry, so aB to secure a doublU guarantee for the safe conduct of the Franchise Bill by the Government.Count Hertling himBelf had repeatedly expressed opinions hostile to &quot;parliamentarisation&quot;, but it was part of the &quot;new departure&quot; that before taking office he had to assure the Reichstag Majority of his acceptance of the four points of their domestic programme:(1)    Equal and direct suffrage for Prussia. (2)    Repeal of the worst legal restrictions on the right of coalition for Labour and for political organisations. (3f     The institution of Labour Chambers or Courts withworking-men members. (4)     The abolition of political censorship, or at least its transference from the military to the civil authori-ties.Hertling was appointed on November 2, and it was thought that the crisis was solved.     But an after-crisis has given great trouble. Difficulties were made about the resignation of Helfferich from the new post of Imperial Yioe-Chancellor and about the appoint-ment of the South-German Radical, Friedrich von Payer, as his successor.    Helfferioh was backed by the Court and the Prussian Conservatives;   and it was only on November 3 that, the resigna-tion of Holfferich having been forced by the political leaders and the PresB, von Payer was appointed Vice-chancellor.   Friedberg himself gave the final blow to the reactionary oppssition by declining to assume the office of Prussian Vice-President unless von Payer were appointed Vice-Crancellor, and, without Friedberg, Hertling^ Prussian Premiership was impossible.4.     All these changes, so alien to the old spirit inPrussia and in the IZrrpire, are acclaimed by the LJberal and the Secialist Press as having launched Parliamentaiism&apos;upon
a forward course from which there can &quot;be no turning baok. In the course of a few weeks, it is maintained, one deadly blow after another has been dealt to Prussianism.    first there was the fall of Miohaelis, beoause the great majority of the Reicbs-tag refused to cooperate with him.    Then there was tho selec-titn of Hertling, a man who bade his career in Parliamont and not in the bureauoracy.    Next came the preliminary eon-diticn of Hertling^ acceptance of the Chancellorship - his arrangement with the Majority to support their programme of reform and to appoint Liberals as his lieutenants.    An entire-ly new constitutional precedent was established when Hertling demanded of the Emperor and. obtained a free hand to select his right-hand men in the Government.    In former days during the present rsign, it is literally true to say that German Chan-cellors on more than one occasion first learned from their morning paper at breakfast that the Emperor had appointed a new Minister or a Oolenial Governor.     It is now regarded as certain that these days will never return.    The struggle of the majority for the appointment of von Payer and Friedberg has, it is thought, established firmly the foundations of a new era.6,      Is the decisive battle of constitutionalism won? Outside Germany peepla will not be too optimistic.    The new Imperial Vice-Chanoellor and tho new Prussian Vice-president may do their best to keep the new Chancellor up to the mark, but they will still have difficulties to contend with. Hertling himself haB not the conviotions of a reformer.     The Party from which he came and which will probably back him most steadily - the Catholic Centre - is by no means united on Referm.    Erzberger and many others are reformers, but somo members of the art rVfc wing of the Centre have already been addressing meetings in the constituencies against
&quot;Parliamentarism&quot;.    Many of the National Liberals are not &quot;Bound&quot; on these questions.    The Prussian Conservatives are  atttrally furious at the whole development;   their Press is telling the Crown that it has sacrificed its ancient rights, and their leaders, like Baron von Zedlitz in the Prussian Chamber, are doing all they can to obstruct and obscure the Prussian issue.    Zedlitz has always been very aotive in the newspapers and is nicknamed &quot;the Press Privy Councillor&quot;. The Prussian Franchise Bill, which has finally been adopted in the Cabinet and will presently be laid before the Chamber, contains * clause which withholds the franchise from anyone who has not possessed Prussian State citizenship for three years, and anyone who has not been domiciled in the same locality for one year.    This provision, the Socialists in-sist, must go.     It would exclude Hertling himself from the franchise, for he only became a Prussian on his appointment as Prime Minister, and his domicile has hitherto been in Munish.On broader grounds it may be pointed out that even if the Franchise Bill is safely steered through the Conserva-tive rocks in the Prussian Chamber and Upper House, it is most unlikely that a Prussian General ISleetion will take place during the war.     It will thuB be impossible to secure while the war lasts the muoh needed Prussian parliamentary backing for the reforms which are beia$ pressed in the Empire.    Such backing is indispensable in order to make the Federal Council of the Empire, with all its fear of centralised Imperial ana parliamentary government, yield to the initiative of a liber-alised Prussia.    Only Prussia can overcome in the Federal Council the partioularist recalcitrancy of the separate German States of which that supreme body is the representa-tive.
6.      Apart from the probability of delay in the exercise of full parliamentary and demooratic pressure through Prussia, there is the ever-present danger that the Crown Prince, the Court, the Military Chiefs, the Prussian Junkers wiih their train of Tirpitz, the new Fatherland Party, the Pan-Germans and all that violent type of people, will, when they see that power is slipping away from them, explode and bring reform abruptly to an end.    Tirpitz himself has by no means thrown up the sponge.    He oontinues, to make speeches and to issue manifestoes;   and it should be remembered that he has a great name as the oreator of the Navy, the inveterate foe of England and the originator o^f the U-boat warfare.    He and the various0pan-German and other Societies whioh back his agitation seem to influence a very large and important class in Germany knwon as the Hitteletand, which may best be described as correepond-ing, not to our Middle Glasses, but to our lowest Middle Glass, This class is, in proportion to the population, much more numerous in Germany than in England.     It consists of small house proprietors, small shop and restaurant keepers, small retired capitalists, small independent handicraftsmen, working on their own premises, and of many others in a similar economic station.    These people gravitate between Social Demooracy, when they are discontented or alarmed, and Pan-Germanism, anti-semitism, and General Chauvinism, when they rally to the cause of &quot;strong government&quot;,     They are important because, when they take the Sooialist side, they alarm the Government and the governmental parties, like the National liberals and the Centre, who dread their potty local influence and their numbers. TheBe people might oonceivably be influenced by brilliant military victories and might suddenly shout for a coup &amp;&apos;etat. A similar class of people in France used in the middle of the last century to be the backbone of Imperialism and Ohauvin-ism.        The Fatherland Party movement and the agitation
9t the Reactionaries - very violent and bitter at this monent in their Press - ought therefore to be reckoned with.Yet,on the other side the influence of the great economic distress, the great scarcity and cost of food, clothing, shoes and coal ought to be reckoned.     The Berlin Municipal Council has Just been discussing the condition of Berlin, which appears to be very serious.    There is a great deal of smuggling of food by the well-to-do and, as a trustworthy witness, a former American Consul, has reported, people feel that they &quot;could not live if they remained honest&quot;.    The poorer classes also try to evade the food regulations and pay extravagant prices to smugglers.    It was even asserted in the discussion that the authorities in some oases connive at contraventions in the interest of the munition-workers.    She greatest scarcity is in flour, in substitutes for butter, in sugar, and in eggs. The Chief Burgomaster of Berlin complained of the difficulty of getting produce in from the country.    The supply of milk was very unsatisfactory.    Vegetables, of which there has been a poor yield, were being delivered in nearly the same quantities as In peaoe-time, but that was not nearly enough in view of &quot;the enormously increased demand&quot;, in consequence of the secur-ity of the foods.     They were trying to improve the bread, which is unsatisfactory in quality.    Socialist members testified that &quot;the supplies of clothing, of shoes and of coal are extremely inadequate and are growing smaller.     In view of such distress housekeeping must become impossible, sickness must increase and the death rate must go up&quot;, and tfcSt &quot;the population of Berlin, new threatened with famine, would also have to shiver with cold this winter for want of heating materials&quot;.    The &quot;ambulatory kitchens&quot; from which masses of the working-classes and some of the more well-to-do get their meals, fetching them in cans and pots from the street, have recently been supplying food of an inferior character, about which there are constant complaints.
V-   -------- rr-r-whilst the people are demanding that the municipal authorities should not merely appear and demonstratively taste the dishes, but should themselves try to live on them for a single month.All these things have destroyed much of the enthu-siasm for the war and for distant &quot;victories&quot;, which only tend to prolong the war.     The people want the system of government changed, and they seem to think that the hope of improving the desperately uncomfortable situation lies in peace and democracy rather than in militarism and territorial expansion.
