12\\1//2% BO NUS TO TIME WORKERS

The present position is as follows:-

1. The bonus has been granted to skilled men in the engineering trades on time work;

2. It has not yet been extended to the same class in shipyards, though the War Cabinet sanction of an expenditure of 8½ millions included this. The extension has been held up at the request of the Admiralty;

3. The semiskilled and unskilled time workers are demanding a similar advance. This means an addition of 600,000 men and 7,250,000, or with the 8½ millions already sanctioned, £15,750,000. No pledges have been given and the Cabinet is entirely uncommitted except by circumstances;

4. The extension of the advance to the semiskilled and the unskilled is strongly supported by the Ministry of Munitions, the Admiralty, the employers and the men. Attention is called to this, for it rarely happens that all parties are so unanimous. The Ministry of Labour however oppose on the general grounds that if this extension is granted the demand for the advance will spread to the whole of the industrial world;

5. There are two alternatives before the War Cabinet:-

(a) to confine the advance to the skilled men;

(b) to extend it to the semiskilled and unskilled at an extra cost of £7,250,000;

6. As has been stated the Ministry of Munitions strongly support (b). They know there will be danger of strikes if this is not done, but they do not base their support on this. They consider that the unskilled time worker has a good case. His case is as follows:-

(i) The leaving certificate prevented him going on piece work, and now that he is free to move, most of the remunerative piece jobs are already occupied;

(ii) He is essential to industry;

(iii) His work is ? owing to increased production;

(iv) He has always been ready to go on piece work;

(v) No class of industrial workers has more loyally supported the war;

7. It is for the War Cabinet to decide whether they stand on the advance to the skilled men or extend it. It is possible, but difficult, to do the former, and the Admiralty regard it as impossible. If however it is done, a minor alteration of the Order is necessary, involving a cost of 750,000 a year, which will give a better line on which, to fight;
8. The advance to the semiskilled and unskilled should either be granted or refused in its entirety; a suggestion has been made that the current advance of 5/- a week given by the Committee on Production should in the case of the semiskilled and unskilled be merged in the 12½. To do this would be worse than doing nothing, for it would mean that they would receive about 1/- a week, a sum which in war time they would consider ridiculous;

9. There has been no occasion since the first year of the war so favourable for a rapprochement with labour. The skilled man&apos;s advance has been conceded not as a result of threats, but voluntarily. If the unskilled man&apos;s advance be similarly conceded, the better feeling and the closer co-operation of labour which will result will be well worth the money.
