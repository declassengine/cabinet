Intelligence Bureau,3SECRET.Department of Infermation. FIW/018.listWeekly Report on Italy* XVIII. (Nov. 15th, 1917)/OoirtrllyTrkcn^r^^ Debacle may be feund in thefollowing:(a)    Socialist propaganda carried an by personal contacts in hi3nesand wtrksheps and with soldiers home from theafront on leave andby mains of the widely ciroulated^Ayanti, whioh inculcates the the   &apos;idea af/futility of war in general and teaches that the moral dutyof the proletariat is to refuea to fight, that the present war is a &quot;Capitalist * War&quot;, that it is a war between two Imperialismsof which that of Great Britain is the worse etc, etc.(b)   The example given in Russia of the rank and file refusing tofight and taking things into its own hands.     The visit of theRussian delegates of the Soviet to Italy and their appearance anddelivery of speeohes at Socialist gatherings served to bring Russia&apos;srevolutionary ideas home even to the illiterate.(o)   Clerical propaganda and the Pope&apos;s Peace Note.     This pro-pagan&amp;a, for which the admirable Catholic organisation produces such extensive fatuities and which finds a ready welcome among the largely illiterate peasantry, who retain a certain loyalty to and a superstitious fear o  the Church, has probably been as important aoi &quot;Viva U Papa B6 J    It is understood that IX is the conviction of Bares Sonnino ,r that the Vatican has bean consistently working with the Socialists and in connivance with the Central Empires by whcsa its peace pra^poeals were inspired.    The Foreign Minister hasfactor in the Army as the more open work of the Socialists. There is a report that fugitives from the Army Wve returned with the cry
fjindeed informed friendly Ambassadors that he has grounds for believing that the Pape will shortly make further peace proposals and that this step will be taken in understanding with the Central Empires.     It has further become indirectly known that the Vatioan is working to prevent any offer hewever advantageous of separate peace being msde to Italyr knowing that it would be rejected as dishonourablc-and would reflect discredit on the Vatioan.   What the Vatioan disires to obtain is a renewed offer of general peace.     The Foreign Minister Minister1 a remarks in the Chamber and^the ?o*e&apos;s peace proposals seem to have been intended as an answer and a rebuke, not t^y to the Socialist Deputy by whom they were immediately provoked, but also to t eeetion of the public represented perhaps even in the Ministry, v/hich had found fault with the Government for neglecting to answer the Papal note, (d)    Enemy propaganda.Numerous doouments have been found containing invitations te the Italian troops to come over and join hands with their German and Austrian comrades.     Immediately on the arrival of the invading army at tfdine proclamations were posted informing the people that the Austro-German armies had not oome there with the intention of oon-quest - all that was Italian would remain Italian - and that their real objeet was to liberate Italy from the yoke of British tyranny.&apos; The Evening Standard of Uov. 8th reproduces from the collection given by the War Correspondent Barzini in the Corriere della Sera specimens of these leaflets in which the Italian soldiersis told that &quot;at the request cf the Italian Government the English and JTenah soldiers who are in Milan and Turin have fired on your old veterans who have been summoned to the colours   and have refused to rejoin&quot;, that 14,000 English troops are in Italy polioing the country,
occupying po*te and Railroads, ruthlessly slaying those who demand peace and bread.     The Austrian is represented as having come to redeem Italy from the fafivn^ tyranny of Britain e^c. etc.     We also have information that German and Bulgarian officers disguised in Italian uniforms and speaking Italian perfectly have mingled with the retreating forces and added to the confusion.     Faked copies of the leading Italian newspapers have been disseminated in the Italian jines containing propaganda of the character indicated above in-serted in the columns devoted to local news.Prospects of reoovery in the Country.It seema clear that the enemy Commander counted en a generalmutiny and immediate revolution.     The Commander oi the GermanCorps is said to have pushed on without escort in a motor-cat towardsUdine before the Italians had aotually abandoned the town and tohave been shot by Carabinieri.     The German and Austrian press haverecently abounded in reports of mutiny in the Italian army andperhapsrevolution in Italian cities - not all of which/were deliberate fiction.Bdth these expectations have, it is now certain, been disappointed. &apos;Tne moral of the country appears to be better than might have been anticipated1.     Party differences are being suppressed and in the most important industrial centres a resolute   and patriotis spirit is shown.     This is notably the case in Milan the head-quarters of Socialism.     See Report on Italy XVII.     The two principal Bpokes-tnen of the Official Socialist Party have issued &amp; Manifesto whioh recommends resistance to the enemy now that Italy is invaded and suggests that it   is the proletariat whioh must save the fatherland. Patriotio manifestoes have been issued by numerous Labour organisa-tions throughout the country and it looks as if the irreconciloable of the Party Executive were losing influence.   The presence of
Bulgarian and Turkish troops on Italian soil is likely to make a strong impression on popular feeling.On th  whole, critical as the situation is, the balanoe, whether we look at the army or the people may be said to incline towards the side of hope.The short sitting of the Chamber on Wednesday Nov. 14th was a demonstration of national unity and resolution to resist at all costs.     Signor Orlandc&apos;s declarations were followed by speeches from Signor Boselli, who moved an Order of the Day agreed upon by four ox-premiers   (Giolitti, Boselli, Salandra and luzzatti) in consultation with Signor Orlando and expressing faith in the Army and the Allies, from Signor Giolitti, Signor Salandra, SignorSignor Giolitti&apos;s reappearance in the Chamber after an absence of almost three years created a strong impression.     His speech, which was short and direct, is reported to have been greeted with cheers but no special ovation.     The Socialist speaker seems to have made a SEimewhat wordy and ambiguous defence of his party steering a middle oourse between  he intransegeant position and that of the two leaders of the Parliamentary group.     Signor Orlando in the cours \ of his declarations did useful service in denying the German calumny, widely circulated in Italy, to the offeat that Great Britain had impwsed onersus oonditlons on Italy as the price of her assistance.On the entry into Italy of Austriw^and German ferces the Pope addressed an appeal to the two Btmperors urging that respect should be shtwn for the laws of civilized warfare and humanity in the treat-ment of the oivll population, especially women and children - and of property and religious institutions.It is not known whether any reply has been received but up to the present m outrages are reported.
An order has also been issued by the Pope enjoining upon the clergy not to leave their uosts.     The Patriarch of Venice, the Archbishop of Milan and the Bisheps of Verona and Como hiive issued patriotic c-pt)6s.ls to their dioceses.
