Hodgson(Private Secretary to Mr. Barnes).THE RT. HOH W.H. LONG sent a letter to Mr. Barnes stating that, as the result of an accident, he was unable to attend.   He pointed out that he fras really a Trustee for His Majesty&apos;s Government, the Dominions and Crown Colonies in regard to the Imperial Institute, end could not share this responsibility with anybody.   In the event of the Cabinet giving a decision in the matter, he would of course be free to state the facts to the Dominions..SIR ALF-ffiD MOND explained that every place where suitable accommodation was likely to be found in London had been
-2-examined and the Imperial Institute was the only suitable building.   He had been present at the Imperial Conference when the possibility of the Imperial Institute being taken for War purposes was discussed.     Mr* Long had given an undertaking to the effect that the utility of the Institution should not be interfered v/ith and Sir Alfred Mend had given anundertaking to Mr. Long that he would make no claim to further space than agreed at that time.    On the other hand the Dominions Royal Commission had reported unfavourably on the Imperial Institute.LORD RH01TDDA explained that the matter was most urgent .   It was proposed in the first instance to use the building for the sugar distribution scheme,  and if a universal system of rationing became imperative,  the some building and the same staff could be used for that purpose.SIR ARTHUR DURRANT said that the exhibits in the Imperial Institute could in Bome cases be left, and in the case of tinned foods and similar exhibits could be stored either in the Imperial Institute er in the Natural History Museum. A proposal which had been made that the Victoria and Albert Museum should be taken instead of the Imperial Institute presented insuperable difficulties, because the exhibits there are priceless ceramics, which cculd only be removed by experts and the removal would take two or three months.THE COMMITTEE decided that the application of the Minister of Food for accommodation in the Imperial Institute should be granted.(Initialled)     G.N.B.Whitehall Gardens,  S.W.13th November, 1917.
