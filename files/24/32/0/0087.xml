1917.17.11.17.During, my tour at the Salonika front. I visited the 12th Corps on the Dolran - Vardar Section and the Italian front in the loop of the Cerna.    I returned via Athens, where I discussed the prospects of Greek mobilization with General Braquet, Chief of the French Military Mission, as well as with several others well qualified to form an opinion.Military sit-     1.    Lt.-Gen* Milne informed&apos;me that he was quite uation atSalonika,       satisfied with the situation and confident about the position on the British front.   This is not, however, tile most vulnerable portion of the allied line,  and the French, Italian and Serbian opinions regarding the situation do not coincide with the above view.As regards the French, I base this statement on remarks made to me at various times at French Hd,Qrs., though&quot;T&quot;w&quot;as never told in so many words that the French Commanders were uneasy as to the result of a strong enemy offensive.   It is well known that theSerbians are uneasy about the situation, and the Italian* 11Commander, General Mombelli, said that he was very.....1 mm?/......apprehensive about tho result of a strong German-Bulgar attach In the Cerna or Monastir region.The weakness of the allied line is duo to its great length in relation to the forces available to hole    jit
it, and to the difficulties of lateral communication, and the consequent comparative isolation of the different sections of the front.     If the enemy decided to attack, he coudu concentrate against any portion of the line a much larger force than could be brought against him there, and it v/ould be difficult to reinforce the threatened point from other sections of the front.. -The weakness of the line is much Increased by the fact that General Sarrail is in supreme command.       On the Macedonian front, in defence as well as in attack, forces of different nationalities are cut off, while fighting, from even adjoining sections of the front,       In these circumstances it is imperative that the various Army Commanders should have complete confidence in the Commander-in-Chief, otherwise any operations must rgsolve themselves into a series of isolated actions on different sections of the. front..Under present conditions it is unlikely that any Army Commander would be willing tc send troops to reinforce another section of the front, for Sarrail keeps no oneinformed of the situation.or of his own intentions, and the different nationalities always fear being exploited to suit the purposes of the French.Profound distrust of Sarrail was general throughout th Allied Forces during the operations of last Spring. This feeling still exists and in the event of a strong attack on the line, ij^might well lead tc disaster.Replace
InReplace Sarrail by an honest, direct, hard-hitting General, with no political aims or interests, and the fighting value of the Allied Forces v/ill be at once greatly increased.2. On the British front the men are fit and seemingly in good condition, but several officers expressed the opinion that most of the men who had been any length of time at Salonika were suffering from the effects of the Crlimatc.      The appreciable reduction in the sick rate last summer compared with that of 1916 appears to contradict the above statement, but the fact is that though many men arc not suffering from any actual disease and consequently do not report sick, yet their physical resistance has been considerably impaired.     This is shown by the large number of extra admissions to hospital v/hich attend any movement entailing marching or other unusual fatigueAs regards moral the 16th Corps on the Struma front appeared to me to be considerably superior to the 12th Corps on the Doiran - Vardar section.     I attribute the difference to the fact that although tho Struma Valley is very unhealthy and enervating, military life is much less monotonous there than near the Vardar, for the country behind the line is fine and the outlook varied, while the broad and weakly-held valley of the Struma affords excellent opportunities for successfully carrying out small voperations.
JIn October one such operation resulted in the capture of 154 Eulgars with a loss of only 2 men killed and about 40 wounded, while a total of 400 Bulgars has recently been cheaply accounted for.     Such incidents are of great value for training purposes and keep our men in good spirits. On the other hand, on the 12th Corps front the enemy positions are strong and continuous, and cur men seldom have an opportunity, of getting the better of the Bulgar by the exercise cf superior intelligence, quickness and training. Here also the conditions of life are tedious in the extreme, and the men get little or no change from the monotony of the trenches.     As a rosiilt they seem far less alert and keen than the men on tho Struma front.of Goner-     3.     At the Italian front I had a long conversation with iombelli,ndg. Italian General Mombelli, the Italian Commander, whom I know welland who, I think, spoke frankly. The chief points to which he drew my attention wore the following :-(a)     He doubted whether, in the present situation, minor operations such as the French had recently been carrying out near Pogradctz, were advisable. &apos; In view of the enormous length cf the Allied line (180 miles from the mouth of the Struma to Lake Okhrida) the almost entire absence cf reserves, and the impossibility at present of effecting anything of a decisive nature, ho censiderea it unwise to increase tho length of the front held by the Allies and unnecessarily to draw the enemy1s attention to KacelToniaF     The&quot;recent operations have resulted in an addition of 20 kilometres to the front, and at the end of October 6 battalions of French colouredt   ?s* hith^i ^ work onL.of C., have been brought into the front line.
fbi    General Mombelli questioned the advisability of the French backing Dssad Pasha and giving bo much prominence to the performances of the Albanians with him.     The latter constitute but a small minority of the Albanian race, most of the remainder being under Austrian influence.     This being so and the military assistance that Sssad can provide being so small, it seemed unwise to run the risk of incurring the hostility of the rest of Albania.(c)   According to General ilombelli, the French are making too much of the Greeks and are inclined to treat them as though they had always wanted to join in the war on our side, and had only been prevented by the pro-German sympathies of King Constantine and his Government,     It should be remembered that Bulgaria is certainly watching closely developments and that a too warm support of the Greeks may well prejudice our chances later of bargaining with that country.The original attitude of Venizelos at Salonika was that the three &quot;Volunteer divisions had come to Macedonia purely to retrieve the honour of Greece. He at that time stipulated for no &quot;quid pro quo&quot; and was prepared to leave the interests of Groeoe to the generosity of the Entente Powers.The point that should always be borne in mind is that a definite undertaking to restore territory to Greece may subsequently prove an insurmountable obstacle I tp bating with Bulgaria, at a time when it may be of the utmost importance to do so.
e.ary Situation   4.     General Braquet, Chief of the French Militaryj,tj, or x o &quot; j v *&quot; Mission in Greeoe, informed me that he was confidentthat he could obtain the personnel necessar:/ to complete 5 new Greek Divisions, making a total of 9, His chief difficulty was the lack of almost every kind of material, the principal requirements being as followsBread, and other food-stuffs,Money (The War chest is empty, though individual Greeks have grown enormously rich during the War,)Rolling Stock and other railway material. Increased means of sea transport. Guns and military equipment. The first and most important deficiency is food; -  in many parts of Greece the inhabitants are not getting enough to eat,-   and it would probably prove neoessary to give the men called up two months&apos; good nourishment before they would be fit to make any physioal exertions.General Braquet stated th^^fn*&amp;^^^tir,^M . ^^Pnt warjgga^^extra divisions should be ready by the early summer, Brigadier-General FairholmeJlfo^WryiSwehe&apos;,&quot; informed me that the French Mission is doing, extremely good work.   The members of the Mission have been well chosen from among officers with war experience In France, and they are doing their work tactfully.   Their attitude is that they have come from France merely in order to provide Greek officers who have already seen fighting, with a short cut to the lessons they themselveshave
have learnt during the war at heavy cost.     This part of the organization of the new Greek army appears likely to be successful.I also discussed the situation with the British Consul and vice-Consul at Patras, who have both spent all their lives in Greece and are able to judge the state of affairs in the Peloponnese.     They consider that the present situation is governed by the food question and that Venizelos has been much hampered by the fact that since he came into power food has been scarce or deficient and prices high. The people attribute the scarcity to him or at any rate complain that his government can do nothing to remedy matters.      If sufficient food could be sent to Greece, mobilization would probably be accepted everywhere and successfully carried out, and Vcnizelos and his government would enjoy widespread popularity.As regards the inhabitants of the Peloponnese, both the Consul and Vice-Consul agreed that tho only definite and universal feeling regarding the war is the desire not to take any active part in It.     At tho same time they considered that if the people were fed and the soldiers knew that their wives and families would be fed during their absence, mobilization could be carried out, provided that Venizelos had a certain amount of force with him at the c ommencerne nt.The people generally realise that they must do as the Entente Powers tell them and that they cannot oppose the latter.     At the same time they feel that Greece is far removed from the scene of the war,in which they have no real interest, and that it matters little to themwhether
whether Germany or England wins.   Hatred of Bulgaria is general in Greece, but this favourable factor is counter-balanced by the fact that we have deposed King Constantine, who was beloved by the army and was the one great military personage in Greece.(3d.)
