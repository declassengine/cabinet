(This Document is the Property ofColonel Jones    j g rj3 Britannic lvlajesty&apos;5 Government.)Intelligence Bureau,S3CRET.Department of Information.Weekly Report on Prance, XVI. (Uov. 14th, 1917)FFW/016.As this Report is &quot;begun the news arrives that M, Painleve has been defeated and has resigned.     The actual issue on which he feill appears   to have &quot;been one of minor imoortante.     The real cause v.-as no doubt the extraordinarily universal impression of indecision and weakness w&amp;ioh he had ereated from the moment he had become Prime Minister.     His firm insistence as War Minister on the pro-motion of petain and Feoh.. had given him a reputation of strength. But it had been lost before he had been Premier a fortnight.     His career during his two months of the Premiership has been one oen-tinuous reoerd of hesitations and blunders, at least from the Parliamentary point of view, and he has managsd te incur the ctft-tempt of all parties and the dislike of mast, thaugh everyone ad-mits his Intelleotual power and high oharaoter.    Ho Ministry could have failed to suffer by the very faot tf suoh a series of scandals and arrests for- treason as have lately distracted Pranoe,and M. Painleve by trying to Maine all parties has ultimately pleasea none.    His last and almost his worst blunder was the raidalleged Eoyalist plot to upset the Republic.     The first result of this was the seizure of a few loadod eanes and half-a-dozen revolvers; the seeond was an explosion %1 ridicule in the Press:   the third was a deeislon l&amp; the Courts that there was no ease te go on against V* Daudet;   and the fourth perhaps, Is the fall of M. Painleve. Possibly his position was further weakened by the faot that a certain M. Paix Seailles, who is a great friend of his and a greaton the office of M. Daudet &apos;s Aotion Franchise en the grounds of an&quot;
i Hiadversary of H. Briand&apos;s, has becoiae mixed up in the Bonnet Bouge Affair, being oharged with communicating a secret document about the Salonioa force to Aimereyda of that paper, who committed suicide after being oharged with treason.     It is fair to say that the journalists who are no friends of M. Paix Seailles assert their belief in his good faith.     But at best he was guilty of a serjLous professional indiscretion and his friendship is no help to a tottering Prime Minister.This time it seems certain that the resignation will be final. To prophesy who will be the new Prime Minister is a perilous and -possibly an unprofitable task.     The gravity of the military situation abroad, and the atmosphere of suspicion at home aroused by the Bolo and other affairs of treason, may suggest M. Cleraenoeau, the inveterate tracker out of all treasonable practices and paci-fist propaganda, who has besides the reputation and reoord of a strong man.    3ut he ie very old;   his temper has left him few friends in any part of the politioal world;   he is detested.by the Socialists who held a meeting a week ago expressly to tal^e pre-oautions against any &quot;Ministry which would seem to be a Challenge to the working-olass&quot; (Clemenceau was very drastic in his methods of dealing with strikes during his three years Premiership);   and he is a personal enemy of the President of the Bepublio whom he hA3 constantly attacked.     Moreover he is said to have refused to take office throughout the war though invited to do so by every Prime Minister in turn.     His position in the country is much stronger than in Paris, bjtt it is Paris and not the oountry that decides these matters.    As the storm has risen during the last fortnight both at home and abroad he has been more and more talked of as the only pilot who can weather it.    He is the opposite pole to Caillaux and, as Caillaux^ star sinks in the mud of Bolo ism and
other susoicious affairs, Clemenoeau/s may well rise in the political heavens.     But, on the whole, age, temper, the Sooialists, and perhaps his own disinclination will probably prevent his succeeding U. Painleve.     It was suggested some time ago that he might stand outside himself and put in M. Pams. the defeated rival of 1L PoincarA at the Presidential election, as his representative. But both of theso solutions would seem ioo likely to involve a presedential oriais.     On the whole a more likely solution is that of a Viviani-Briand or a Barthou Ministry.     The Socialists have no loveoSf Briand but they would probably be less unwilling to join in a oombination with him than they would have been before his action about the German pease proposals which led to the fall of M. Ribot.     They muoh preferred his attitude to M. Eibofs rigid refusal to have anything to do with the Lancken-Brooqueville suggestions,     Viviani was Prime Minister at the beginning of the war and Minister of Justice under Ribot.    He is a man of great eloquenee and acceptable to the Left.     The alternative is M. B&amp;tihua, whose sucoession te M. Pain^eve was considered certain till the debate cf Oct. 25th in which he offended the Left by refusing to define the guarantees1 that might be necessary at the end of the war, and by appearing to favour the policy of a fpaix de pessibili tes&apos;;   that is, of ticking ae muoh as the nature of the victory -allows.     He strenuously denied this imputation:   but, as shown in the last Report, his language was not very clear,   He is still very unpopular with the Socialists as having been the author of the Three Years Service system, has not the reputation of being a very lcyalcolleague and certainly has not improved his position since hecbecame Foreign:Minister.   But he has ambition and is Credited with will and strength.     He would try to get the co-operction of the Socialists but is believed to be quite ready to do without them
if they remain unreasonable.   Events in Russia and Italy may im-prove his chaases,Wheever the nr Prlvni Minister turns out te be - and the un-expeoted is always possible - there is no likelihood ef any weakening in the French attitude abeut the war.     The Freneh have, perhaps,less capacity than any nation for seeing things from any but th-*x own national pcint of view.    But in spite of the indig-nation with Russia, far more frequently and violently expressed in the French papers, even such papers of the Ssctrome left as le Pays, than in England, and in spite of the impatience with the Italians who have never been popular In Franoe, there is no sign in any quarter of any slackening in the French will to victory and a permanent peaoe - Still less is there any sign of a desire to play with the German temptation of a separate peaoe, the arrange roent of which is evidently still the dream of Ktihlmann.     M. BriaEd kas been aooused of some naSvete&quot; in treating the Brooqueville-Lancfcen&apos; peaoe offer so seriously as he did:   but, however that may be, it is oertain that he never for one moment contemp&amp;ated that the French Government should act apart from the Allies.    We know that in his latter oonreying the alleged German proposals to the Gevernment he again and again in almost every paragraph in-sisted upon the neoessity of doing nothing without consulting tho Allies.     He suggested that, if he was authorised to meet German representatives, there must be a preliminary understanding $hat they agreed to the restoration of Belgium and Alsace-Lorraine and to payment for all damage done, while the Allies might agree that no penal damages were to be demanded, no intense economic war sheuid be waged against Germany after peaoe and that the ojiestien of the Left Bank of the Rhine should not be raised.     Nothing came of all this as no meeting took place, because Ribot, probably
A    It   A1A&amp;rightly, regarded the whole affair as a German trap.     But the points are interesting as showing what is in one very important French statesman&apos;s mind about that part ef the terms of peaoe which most directly concern Franoe.     It is to be observed that nothing whatever is said in this account of M. Brland&apos;s views , whioh comes from a very sure source, as to that strip of the Saar valley whioh, as has been generally thought, Franoe desired to have as well as Alsace-Lorraine,mM. Briand, it may be noted, puts the left bank of the Rhine out of discussion.   This, of course, refers to that northern er Rhenish-Prussian part of the left bank whioh impartial ebservers believe to be on the whole as German in sentiment as the southern or Alsatian part is French.   It is worth while saying plainly that in spite of the Chauvinist interruptions in the debate of Oct. 25 there is no serious body of opinion in Franoe in favour ef attempt-ing to annex E&amp;enish Prussia.     The Socialists are openly and very strongly against any kind of annexation and against this in par-ticular;   and it may be said that it is not seriously supported in any quarter.     ^hat it was that the Socialists aotually pro-posed in the secret sessien which M. BarthOu subsequently used against them far debating purposes is not oertain.     &apos;A&apos;hey seem to have admitted that under certain circumstances they would desira as one of the guarantees of peace the neutralisation of eertain territories, and it is said that their suggestion was that Rhenish Prussia might remain German, but that Germany should undertake net te maintain fortresses or large armies there.     The reply ef U* Renaudtl in the debate gave no details of this sert, but merely pointed out that the guarantees hinted at by U. Bartheu were guarantees impesed by force, and liable to be set adide by force, but that the neutralisations which he had suggested would be under
.111145the guarantee of the 3ociety of Nations.      his once more shows the apparent incapacity of men like Renaudel to understand that the Society of nations, if constituted after the war, must remain fa?? a long time an experimental venture of faith, feeling its way very gradually to a reign of international law, but quite unable to provide the guarantees of security whioh statesmen must demand until its strength has been tried and not found wanting.     This is the chinerioal side of the Socialist attitude towards the aims of war and the terms of peace.     On the ether hand they are insisting cn the necessity pf defining our peace as a peace of Rught, a peace depending not on circumstances so muoh as on principles;   and if they go on to say as they do that peace can be and should be new dofined in terms which neither victory nor defeat can alter, it is to be hoped that they mean by this that the territorial rearrange-ments of the peace, being dependent on nationality and the right of people to dispose of themselves, are definite and unalterable, and not that G*rmaay is to be allowed to continue the war indefinitely without exposing herself to the rifek of heavier economic penalties. But however this may be, it ia important to notice that when the Socialists talk of principle they mean what they say and apply its benefits to others as well as themselves.     Pacifism is commoner in their party than in any and for that reason if there were any party that might be expeoted to like the idea of a peace which ignored the claims of others as long as it satisfied France, it would be the Socialists.     But both Renaudel their peader and Albert Thomas have lately gone out of their way rc repudiate any such attitude.   Ten days ago Thomas at a meeting in the country called on hie hearers to continue the war till&amp;a durable peace could be reached and de-clared that this involved securing the liberty of Belgians, Serbians, Roumanians, Italians and the Slavs of Austria-Hungary and the
Armenians of Turkey.   Renaudel&apos;s words were even mere striking. He said that Alsaoe&apos; Lorraine is the symbol of a prinoiple which in-vflras the settlement, for instanoe, of the questions of the Trentino and Trieste, and the re-establishment ef Serbia in her former position (dans son developpment d&apos;autrefois, which might mean, but prebably dees not, muoh mare than the Serbia ot 1914).    It is plain that if the Socialist leader used language of this kind there is no need to fear that French opinion as a whole is weakening in its resolve, to continue the war till the goal is reached.    The very faot that reoent German feelers for^peaoe have suggested that it might be made at the expense of Russia, and that the pacifist man-*eurvres in Italy were largely ef Clerical inspiration have tended to stiffen the attitude of just thfcse parties in France which would otherwise be most likely to be tempted inte the German trap. Neither the bid fer immediate peace of Lenin and his oolleagues,\A.nor even the previous terms of peaoe issued by the Soviet have been treated seriously in Franes.    Even in Socialist quarters it is seen that the Leninites and the Kienthalian ideas of immediate peaee and rights of peoples to dispose of themselves are absolutely inoom-patlble with eaoh other.    A mere serious danger la that whioh oentres in the Vatican.But there is no sign that Cardinal Gaspari &apos;s Attempt to prove that France was speoially favoured by the Popefs appeal has had muoh effect;   and it is to be hoped that the further effort whioh is being prepared by the summoning of French bishops, even the pat-riotie Cardinal A&amp;mette, to Rome will have any better success.It is perhaps worth noting that appreciative references to the share ef Great Britain in the war have of late been fairly numereus in the Frenoh Press.     Not long ago M- Hanotaux, no great Anglophil, wrote of England as having borne both by land and sea the heaviest
burden of the war. Our freedom from political arises, our political genius, our generosity towards subject races have been highly praised. Even the De?ats shows some sign of understanding the vital importance of the British Navy to the whole Alliance, and, though the French say very little about what we have done for them lately in the supply of coal and wheat, and never ask themselves whether any French Government would have dared to put the French people on even voluntary rations in order to supply the needs of an Ally, yet it is satisfactory to have from the Minister concerned with these things an admission that France was the fact that she has got the coal and wheat she needs to the generosity of the British Government and people, who in order to help their Allies willingly accepted an arrangement involving difficulties and privations for themselves.

P.S. As this Report goes out the news comes that the President has invited M. Clemenceau to form a Ministry and that he has accepted the task. M. Poincaré has either felt that the call for Clemenceau can only be silenced by giving him his chance, or he has thought that, as the only non-personal ground of M. Pain? fall was his supposed weakness in dealing with the various charges of treason, the constitutional course was to follow this indication and send for the man most identified with the policy of &apos;thorough&apos; in these matters. The suggestion that Caillaux, who has already had to appear before the Court in connection with these investigations, will ultimately be found to be seriously involved, may have pointed to the most prominent of Caillaux&apos; enemies as the natural Prime Minister. Whether M. Clemenceau will succeed in forming a Ministry is, of course, far from certain. If he does it will be in the ? of the most bitter opposition any Prime Minister has had to face since the war. It is
16. 11. 17.announced to-day that the Socialists, Badical-Socialists and Republican-Socialists are for the first time trying to act together and insist upon a pure Cabinet of the Left.     Clemenceau&apos;s acceptance of, office in the face of this is a challenge te o?e* war
