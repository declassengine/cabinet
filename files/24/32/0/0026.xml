[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty s Government.j ^ ----//SECRET.I UNDERSTAND that, the arrangement made by the Foreign Office with the French and Italians about the importation of food obliges us to alienate approxi-mately at least 2,000,000 tons of potential imports next year to the supply of those countries. It must be pointed out that this cuts directly into our importation of Munitions material, and thereby reduces our capacity to supply the armies with their only means of obtaining superiority in 1918. I do not seek to reopen the question which has been settled, but only to point out the very serious consequences of the decision, which has no doubt been forced upon us. But I urge that, before any similar decision affecting Munitions or other forms of raw material is taken, this Department may be informed and may be given an opportunity at least of stating the case.The supply of nitrates is typical. On this depends our whole explosives supply, including not only the propellant for guns and high explosives for artillery shells, but also the Admiralty mines, the trench mortar programme, and the aeroplane bombs. Our existing high explosives plant is capable of supplying all these needs satisfactorily in 1918- It is not now being worked to its full capacity. In order to press it to its full capacity we require 788,000 tons of Chili nitrates to be imported within the Munitions Budget year. We have at present only arranged with the Shipping Controller for 000,000 tons. Explosives are one of the governing factors of war power. We are therefore threatened with a loss of nearly a fifth of our potential capacity unless the importation can be raised to the full amount asked.Before Christmas, at M. Thomas&apos;s earnest appeal, I met the need of the French by a loan of 40,000 tons of nitrates, repayable by definite arrangement in January or February. The French are now demanding that the Shipping Controller should carry large additional consignments of nitrates for them, out of which they intend perhaps to make a nominal repayment of our 40,000 tons to us. Whatever is conceded to the French in this respect will be a direct diminution of our explosives supply. It is not much use their making repayment from this source.We ought to endeavour to gain and keep the control of the war to which our strength entitles us, using that strength to sustain our Allies without allowing them to lose their self-reliance. We should be careful not to dissipate our strength or melt it down to the average level of exhausted nations. It will be better used with design by us than weakly dispersed. Resolute to expend everything for the common cause, we ought not to shrink from being taskmasters. I deprecate most strongly our making any general agreement in regard to Munitions and raw materials similar to that which has been made about food. On the contrary, I would continue to make ad hoc allocations when particular emergencies are shown, always exacting, where possible,
Borne other services or accommodation in return. There must at any rate be one strong power to face Germany in 1918. To strike an average in these matters, to bind oneself in advance to some system of &quot; share and share alike,&quot; and thus to deprive ourselves of all our power of giving when need arises may be logic it may even be equity but it is not the way to win the war.WINSTON S. CHURCHILL.November 11, 1917.
