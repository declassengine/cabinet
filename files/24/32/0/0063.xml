Colonel Jones[This Document j.s the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.] Printed for the War Cabinet.   November 1917.CONFIDENTIAL.- MEMORANDUM ON THE TONNAGE SITUATION.&apos;ALL ^F;^IT is submitted that the time has come when the world tonnage situation must he dealt with as a whole. Up till now the position has been that each country has treated its own shipping as primarily, if not exclusively, a matter of domestic concern. It is quite true that we have lent much of our shipping to our Allies for their needs, and it is also true that we have divided neutral shipping which we could charter in fixed proportions between ourselves and our Allies. But we have not formally recognised until very lately any obligation to provide tonnage for the importation of goods necessary for our Allies.Take, for instance, the coal situation in Italy. We recognised months ago that the minimum requirements of Italy for coal were 680,000 tons a month. We bound ourselves to supply tonnage for quite a small fraction of this quantity I ifliink some 150,000 tons, and at the urgent request of the Italians we have supplemented this amount by 200,000 or 300,000 tons further. In a sense, we have done all, and more than all our duty to the Italians, but the fact remains that for very many months they have not received much more than half the minimum quantity necessary for their consumption. The result has been most unfortunate, both materially and diplomatically. There lias been very grave want of coal in Italy-at first concealed by the fact that the Italians were using up their stocks, both civil and naval, but latterly only too obvious. Coal has gone to famine prices; necessary railways have been paralysed ; munition works have been put out of operation, and a fruitful subject has been furnished to disloyal propaganda. Diplomatically, the coal question has been a running sore. Perpetual representations by the Italians have been met with civility indeed, but no effective response, and it is, on the whole, surprising and to the credit of both countries that so little friction between them has been engendered. Or take, again, the question of French and Italian corn. The exceptionally bad harvest in both countries produced an acute shortage both in France and Italy. The result was a sudden and imperative demand by the French and Italian Governments that the urgent needs of their population should be supplied, and in each case hasty diversions of shipping and other expedients were resorted to in order to avert a serious want of necessary food. Such sudden modifications of programme are not only dangerous for the reasons already alluded to with regard to coal, but are exceedingly wasteful in tonnage. They mean sudden congestion of ports and waste of labour in transhipment, with the accompanying disorganisation and delay. These evils result from our failure to recognise that unity of our economic effort is at least as necessary as unity of our military and naval effort.If we are to treat shipping as still on a peace footing, it is no doubt true that each country has the right to its own shipping, and to no more; and, indeed, if we are logical, we ought to abandon our agreements as to sharing neutral tonnage and go back to the senseless competition which prevailed about it in the earlier months of the war. Indeed, even as to this question of neutral tonnage, there still seems some misunderstanding, which has led to a prolonged controversy with the United States over the &quot; sharing &quot; of Norwegian tonnage, whereas if shipping is to be regarded from a war point of view it does not matter a dump wdiether it is chartered to British or American owners.It is said that, if all the Allies were always moved by an unqualified desire for victory, and nothing else, and if their sympathy for one another were always perfect, no fixed arrangements would be necessary, and it would be enough to express a general view that each should help the other to the best of his ability.But, apart from the fact that the standard of human excellence required for this method of dealing with the problem is unreasonably high, it would still leave the
disadvantages that accrue from the want of any fixed plan in dealing with a practical problem. On the other hand, it must be admitted that in a matter of the tremendous complexity involved in the control of a vast mass of heterogeneous shipping it would be madness to have a cast-iron system incapable of modification to meet emergencies. It seems, however, possible to lay down some general principles, and to construct machinery which will carry them out at any rate, with far better results than have hitherto been attained. To make my meaning clear, and at the risk of apparent dogmatism, I will put my proposals in the form of definite propositions, doubtless capable of improvement in many particulars : 1. All Allied tonnage and all neutral tonnage, so far as it can be controlled by the Allies and is not wanted for the necessary services of neutrals, should be devoted exclusively to war work, and should be put into one common pool.2. Estimates should then be made as to the growth or diminution of that pool arising from shipbuilding on the one hand, and losses on the other.3. Estimates should also be made of the necessary shipping requirements of each country, in order to furnish it with the necessary supplies and munitions on the one hand, and to provide for military and naval transport on the other.4. On the basis of these estimates, a provisional allocation should be made of the tonnage necessary for each nation for six months, or such shorter period as may be thought right.5. To carry out these operations a small International Committee should be formed, consisting of one representative of each of the principal Allies. It might Lie advisable to have two such committees, one sitting in London, and one in Washington, connected by a special wire commandeered for the purpose.6. If any change in the allocation of tonnage became necessary application would be made to this International Committee.7. In each country a committee would be formed, with liaison officers from the International Committee if necessary, to make the best use of the shipping allocated to that country.8. In case of any dispute arising between any of the national committees it would be referred to the International Committee.It does not follow, of course, that the standard of consumption for each country would be the same. On the contrary, the national habits and needs of each country would have to be taken into consideration, and it may be also that some allowance would have to be made in order to meet national prejudices, for the fact that some countries have much more shipping than others.(Initialled) R. C.Foreign Office, November 15, 1917.o
