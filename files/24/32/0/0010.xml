(1This Document Is the Preroperty ofSECRET.itannic Majesty10Int ellien c e Bur eau,Department of Information.BPW/020.Weekly Report on Poland.   XX. (14th ifovember, 1^17.)Attention was called in our report of October 19 to the fact that almost five weeks intervened between the publication of the new Austro-German Decree concerning Poland on September 12 and the appointment of the Regency Council on October 15.     Two theories were current about the reasons of that delay.     According to one. the Germans refused to appoint the-Regency Council before an understanding was reached concerning the person of the future Polish Premier.     All three candidates for the Regency Council, and especially Prince Lubomirski, are reported to have insisted on Count Adam Tarnowski being chosen for that post; and the Germans are said to have refused to admit him.     The other theory has it that the delay was caused by difficulties in reaching an under-standing concerning the programmatic declaration to be made by the Regentr on taking office.     The fact.is that they solemnly assumed office at Warsaw on Saturday, October 27, that the declaration made by them was exceedingly non-committal, and that up till now no definite choice seems to have been made for the post of Polish Premier.The induction of the Regency Council was performed with extraordinary pomp (a special committee had elaborated its ceremonial).      In tblbt statement read out by Count Joseph Ostrowski the Regency Council naturally declared that it takes its stand on the basis created by the Austro-German decrees of November 5, 1916 and September 12, 1917.     At the banquet which followed in
the Castle Archbishop Kakowski bowed yet deeper and drank to the health of the Germanic Emperors.It is much too early for any one to pronounce any definite judgment on the Regency Council or to attempt any forecast of its future policy except in its most general outlines.     It is certain that the three Regents are not political gamblers, that Prince Lubomirski and Count Ostrowski are dignified, moderate Conservatives, and that Archbishop Kakov/ski. stands for extreme clericalism and is in politics a doubtful quantity.     It is further certain that, things remaining what they are, they, as the entire Conservative interest in Poland, will not merely &quot;for fear, &quot;but for conscience sake&quot;, lean In the one direction from which that interest can receive effective support - in the direction of the Central powers. Ho one can expect Poliah Princes and Archbishops to wish for the appearance of Russian revolutionary armies.     But how far their opportunism and their class interests will carry them no one can foretell as yet, probably not even they themselves.The fev/ appointments which the Regency Council has made so far - mainly for their secretariat - are almost all from the Realist Party.     For their &quot;Chancellor&quot; (chief secretary - all Polish officials now receive high-sounding titles) they have chosen Mgr. Chelmicki,. who, although not a member of the Provisional Council of State, was one of its staunchest and most devoted supporters.A rumour, which in&apos;&apos; a moduli-censored form appeared in some Polish papers, has it that the Germans have indicated that the Poles can have the White Russian parts of Vilna and Grodna at the price of raising an army.    Y/hether this rumour is true or not -and it seems doubtful whether it can be accurate in the form in which it appears - there certainly is a grain of truth in it.     The Germans cannot possibly raise an army in Poland unless they hand over to the Poles districts to which the Poles have no right by
nationality, i.e., territory which Russia can under no circum-stances voluntarily cede to them or even renounce.    Russia and the entire Entente have acknowledged Polish independence,   and for Polish independence within the borders which justice would pre-scribe to Poland, the Poles have consequently no reason to fight against Russia.    On the contrary, a Polish army raised in Poland, unless it is misled by imperialistic visions, would be a danger to Germany because whatever measures of precaution the Germans might take by appointing officers of their own etc., onoe a Polish Government is in existence it is for the Polish army the only authority which it will obey in the last resort.     Therefore unless Germany offers to Poland provinces whicb are essentially Russian, and unless the Poles accept that Danaan gift, the Germans not merely cannot wish, but can hardly even admit, the creation of a Polish army of any considerable size.     This is the real intrinsic connection between the question of Lithuania and a Polish army.Still is it essential for the Regency Council to patch up the conflict which broke out in the Polish Legions in July 1917, and to get the Legionaries released from their internment and the legions restored.     The Legions were a creation of the Radical-Socialist Left, which however since the outbreak of the Russian Revolution certainly sees no reason to fight against revolutionary Russia.   An attempt of the pro-Austrian Conservatives to break the influence which the Left exercised over the Legions and to impose on the Legions a monarchical and anti-Russian policy has led to their total disruption.     The Left will never support or even in the long run tolerate a Government which tolerates the imprisonment or internment of the Legionaries.     On the tther hand the Germans cannot very well reverse their policy and capitulate before the stubborn opposition of the Legions, nor can the Regency
Council completely disavow the deeds of its predecessor, the Polish Provisional Council of State.     Yet practically everybody would like to bury the hatchet, patch up the quarrel and open the v/ay to new co-operation.     Therefore the report that the Regency Council is considering a new form of oath for the Polish army, does not necessarily signify that it intends to raise a regular, large Polish army and that the Germans agree to it, though in the contingency named above this may be the ultimate outcome.     What the discussion of a new form of oath means iamediately is a restoration of the Legions and. a composing of the conflict which broke out over the question of the oath.     The declaration madjc by the Regency Council on the day of its in-duction says: &quot;We are to lay the foundations for an independent and powerful Polish State with a strong government, a Diet and an army of its own.&quot;    No indication is given when any part of this programme is to be realised and one may assume it as certain that no one could give such indication at the present moment. The Central Powers and Poland.The news of Germany having agreed to the Austrian solution of the Polish Question (the union of Russian Pol^aid with Galicia), which about the middle of last week was accepted by the press, even the German press, as an accomplished fact, proves to have been, to say the least, premature.     The chances of its being accepted are now decidedly greater than they were about a month ago; Hertling, the German Roman Catholics, and especially Bavaria have little reason for opposing it.     The opposition to it comes mainly from the Prussian, Protestant Conservatives.     Still, however useful the Roman Catholics may be to Germany at the present juncture and however much she puts them into the fore-ground, it would yet seem doubtful whether their influence could entirely override that of the Old Prussians.     It seems therefore advisable to take any such news with extreme caution.
14/11/17.That Austria is now making a desperate hid for Poland is proved incidentally by a fact which has leaked out about the negotiations which Dr. Seidler conducted with the Polish leaders in Vienna about the end of September and beginning of October. The Poles insisted on having a civilian, Polish governor in (Jalicia, the Austrian army circles on continuing the military regime.    Then the Austrian Premier came forward with a proposal for having a joint governor for Galicia and the Austrian sphere of occupation of Poland, which would have probably meant that General Count B. Szeptycki, who previously commanded the Polish Legions and is now Govern or-General of the Austrian sphere of occupation, and is extremely popular among his compatriots, should become also Governor of Galicia.     This would have established a closer connection between Galicia and one half of Russian Poland - it would have amounted almost to a coup d&apos;Btat With regard to the Germans.     Bat it would have been that also with regard to the Polish government in Warsaw.     A closer connection between one half of Poland and Galicia   would mean a looser connection between the two halves of Poland.     The Poles therefore could never have considered at all any such proposal; that it should ever have been made proves on the part of the Austrian Government very imperfect knowledge of Polish opinion.
