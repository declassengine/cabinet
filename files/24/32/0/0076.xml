Personally i think Clasps are bound to be given, and i myself support the proposi-tion.He then asked whether it would be possible for theColonies themselves to give a Medal for Gallipoli.   i findthere is a precedent for Colonies giving-a special iviodal andI think there would be no difficulty in this respect.Colonel Griffiths was very anxious that thereshould be two conditions -(1)     That the troops should havo left Australia or New Zealand in 1914, and(2)     That they should have taken part in the Oallipoli Campaign.The Rt. Hon. \..H.Long, M..\
I should therefcre suggest that the respective Governments he informed -(l)     That Clasps would be given for Gallipoli on the ordinary British Medal-, and(2)     That the Australian and New Zealand Governments., with the full concurrence of the Army Council and the sanction of His Majesty&apos;s the King, are empowered to grant special Medals to be issued by themselves to those Australians and New Zealand Forces who left Australia and New Zealand in 1914 and took part in the Gallipoli Campaign.The matter is very urgent and if you agree to this proposition please let me know.     I am submitting it to the War Cabinet to save time.Yours(3d)   DERBYSecretary,War CabinetPlease see.    Could this be circulatedforthwith.(Sd)   H.J. CREEDY..19-11-17
