\ (THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY: OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVERNl^N^-&quot;,30S EGRET- &quot; WAR   CABINETQ.T. 2608I TALI AIT    51 THAT I ONTe1egram from General Lei me Radoliffe to&quot;the Chief of the^ Imperial General Staff.despatched 3.30 p.m. -   Received 8.15 p.m., 13th Ncvemher   1917. 669.   November 13th. Secret and personal.Following from General Wilson for information of War Cabinet (begins) -W.104 November 13th.     Diaz is gradually making himself felt and areas in rear of PIAVE are being cleared and plans for retirement, if one should be necessary, are assuming clearer shape.   This is all good.   On the other hand, a few hundred Austrians, with machine guns yesterday morning, got lodgaent on the right bank of PIAVE at ZENSON east of TREVISO,  and up to now Italians have not thrown them back.   This is disquiet-ing, and had a depressing effect this morning on Diaz.   Last night in a long talk with the King, I found that he was distinctly anxious about his troops being able to hold their present line.   Diaz this morning was evidently of the same opinion.   Meanwhile French ooncentration at VICENZA and to the N.W. continues, and ought to be completed by the 17th.   I am still unable to get progP-rome of cur detrainments, and there-fore still unable to give dates for our forward move. Yesterday I reconnoitred the position which I selected South ofVICENZA.   It is.very strong, I do not propose to advise as regards reinforcements by 5th and 6th Divisions for another day or two.   There will be no less   of time if the divisions are ready to move.There is, in short, no material difference in situation since yesterday, and v/e are one day nearer time v/hen we can afford kelp,  (ends)
