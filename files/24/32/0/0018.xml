No, S.4/3.SECRET.From:-   Lieut, General Earl of Cavan, B.E.F., Italy.81Chief General Staff, War Office.10th November, 1917.Mantua,Sir,I have little to add to telegrams that I have sent,and those of General Delme Radcliffe as regards the situation.impressions I have formed after motoring many hundred miles through the towns of Lombardy and Venetia,(1)   There are an enormous number of men of military age in civilian clothes in every town with apparently no particular business.(2)   There seems to be a general feeling that nothing matters much in Venetia, but that an invasion of Lombardy and Milan would be very serious indeed. From the strictly military point of view I noticed -That there seemed to be no great change in the dispositions about the BainsIzza Plateau between the numbers of Divisions kept well forward for offensive action during the late attack, and the resumption of the defensive.Hence the two somewhat astounding facts that over 800,000 men were concentrated in a small area when the Austro-German attaok began, and that 400,000 of these are now &quot;reforming&quot; in towns 80 to 100 miles south and west of the Piave - such as Ferrara - all of the Second Italian Army.The number of fine well fed men that I met on the road is most striking.   The King of Italy told me in my interview with His Majesty that lack of training in open warfare was the great fault.   The men would attack from trench to trench if led by anIt may be of interest however, to record some of theofficer
officer, but were completely lost if expected to set as a rear-guard,, or independently,I know little or nothing of the political side of therecent defeat except that it seems to have been common talk in the hospitals that the men were not going to fight this Winter,I am, however, quite sure that the dispositions for defence were extremely faulty, judged by our own standards and eur textbooks.The idea of defence in depth does not seem to be grasped, and foresight was completely lacking in preparation of back lines of defence, though line upon line of trenches at a few hundred metre intervals, from the front, were given up without a struggle no reserves - no idea of counter-attack.The happy-go-lucky, childlike spirit seems still topervade everybody, much talk, little action, and even now not one spade has been put into the ground behind the Adige or the Mincio, though there are masses of troops available in every village,I saw to-day 500 fine men at Volta on the Mincio, and two very pleasant officers who seemed quite astonished that I should want even to look at the river and the ground with a view to possible line of defence, and chance for counter-attack.I can see a distinct feeling of anxiety in the High Command,The bright side of the picture is that I can detect no loss of &quot;moral&quot;, and I feel sure that the encouragement of the arrival of British troops has a stimulating effect.Acting under advice of Sir H, Wilson, 6 small parties of 1 officer and 6 men each are making a lorry tour of the three Army Headquarters and their neighbourhood starting to-morrow evening 11th.The first troop train arrives to-night at 10,30 p,m, Detrainment at St, Antonio, five kilometres north of Mantua&apos;
I expect Sir Herbert Pluratr   to-morrow or next day and all arrangements are made for him and his whole Army Staff here in Mantua.     Offices included.I have ready for him a short appreciation based on what I have learnt from all sources.The gist of it is that I think the Piave Line will hold until the enemy can bring a really strong concentration of guns on to such parts of it as they select;   this may be ten days or possibly three weeks, but I do not think it will take the enemy so long as three weeks as they were shelling the Vidor bridge at 6 p,m, the ninth inst,I do not see how the 23rd and 41st British Divisions can be in a position to strike at enemy advance guards who succeeded in crossing the Piave before the 26th inst.As the suggestions I have made may not meet with Sir H, Plumer1s acceptance, it is not worth while repeating therruI am sure, however, that he will agree that under the circumstances it would have been most unwise to concentrate any further for?*ard than we are doing.The roads are already choked between Padua and the Po with refugees: (according to unconfirmed reports only).All my Staff are well and comfortably billeted,LATER:The German Communique says &quot;Asiago has fallen&quot; but even at the very worst our concentration should be complete before the enemy can hurt us.     I s&apos;jill hope that the Piave may hold for aiother week,I have the honour to be Sir,Your obedient Servant, (Sd.) Cavan. Lieutenant-General.
