(This Document is the Property ofHis Britannic IVlajesty&apos;s Government.)NOTE ON GENERAL ALLIED TONNAGE POSITIONIf Great Britain left (and maintained) the same quantity of tonnage at the disposal of her Allies as at present the decrease in her imports in 1918 as compared with 1917 would be 6,000,000 tons.If she has to supply extra tonnage for the increased French and Italian cereal demands of something over 2,000,000 tons the decrease will he over 8,000,000 tons.The effect of such a decrease has been described in a separate memorandum.Such a statement, however, takes no account of the decrease of carrying power of the French and Italian mercantile marines during this year.It is difficult to obtain adequate information but such0as is available may be summarised as follows Francs.France has furnished elaborate statements as to her tonnage and requirements.   These declare a deficit of 3,, 700,000 tons d.w. or say 2z million tons gross.   The statements are, however, in some respects inaccurate and inconsistent and, as regards certain commodities, obviously excessive.   After reducing the extra cereal demands to bring them into accord with the agreed reduced programme, correcting their allowance for the times of certain voyages and striking off any increase for coal (of which they are already obtaining in home production and imports between i and i million more tons a month than last winter)   their deficit might be taken as about 2i million tons d.w. or say li million tons gross, or say a deficit of 6 million tons of imports including the li million tons of extra cereals demanded.   This does not allow, howevor, for any cutting down of her requirements other than coal and cereals.It is best to correct this by calculating the reduction in carrying power through losses and the consequent deficit inimports
imports as compared with those actually carried this year plusthe increased cereal demand.In the first 9 months of this year France lost 348,842 gross tons of steam and sailing&quot; vessels.   This for the complete year would be equivalent to about 450,000 gross tons of steam vessels and allowing for some reduction in losses the reduction in the mean number of her own vessels in 1918 as compared with. 1917 may be taken at 400,000 tons,&quot;Increased charterings of neutrals may be,perhaps set against losses of neutrals, but no more.   France has in addition lost about 350.000 tons gross of British shipping in her service. The British calculations assume that future but not past losses will be made up.    Her mean loss on this account may therefore be taken to be 150,000 tons gross for 1918 as compared with 1917.This means that Prance will have an importing tonnage reduced by some 550,000 tons gross, i.e, her reduction in imports as compared with this year will be sine 2i million tonsa   Adding this to the increased cereal demands there is a deficit of 4 million tons.This is 2 million tons less than the figure obtained as above by an examination of Francefs own statement of her needs and must be taken to be a conservative estimateItaly.Italy has made no comprehensive estimate of her own deficit in ships.Adopting, however, the method of reckoning the reduction of carrying power through losses we find that in the first 9 months of this year Italy lost 277,535 gross tons of steam and sailing vessels.   We may perhaps take this as meaning that she will have the equivalent of about 350,000 gross tons of steam tonnage less working on her service next year than this.No
allowance need be made--for reduction-in neutral orBritish vessels.The deficit is therefore about li million tons to which must be added her increased demand of some 600,0G0 tons for cerealsHer total deficit is therefore, on a conservative estimat 2 million tons (including the extra cereal demand-).The total deficit of the 3 countries next year as compared with 1917 may therefore be taken asGreat Britain 6?000\000France (through losses) 2,500,000-Italy (through losses) 1,250,000French &amp; Italian increased cereal demand 2,250,000deficit 12,000,000which requires to be made up by better management, or reduction in imports or aid from America.The French have changed the employment of their vessels in such a way as perhaps to increase importing power by 1 million tons.   There is probably not much scope with Italy,Neutral Situation.It can scarcely be hoped that, at the best, we shall be able to obtain for Allied service, more neutrals than are required to replace losses, except so far as we withdraw Norwegian vessels in American trade (and as state! below this will effect the extent of the American assistance we can hope for).America.A recent official American statement gives the American oceangoing tonnage (including German vessels as at November 1st41917 as604 tonnage d,w.Of
Of this total over one million tons consist of tankers, and about half the remainder is of the passenger-cargo type.The official statement estimates that after allowing for the neutral tonnage now in American service their requirements necessitate 371,546 tons daw. in excess of the tonnage they had in September, which may perhaps mean that with the recent additions to tonnage they would about make ends meet if they gave no further aid to the Allies,They contemplate chartering about 500,000 tons d.w. extra of -Scandinavian tonnage, while also retaining the 500,000 tons of Norwegian shipping now in their service, in which case they contemplate putting about 500,000 tons d.w. into Allied Service.On the somewhat optimistic hypothesis therefore that the Americans could obtain all the extra Scandinavian tonnage they contemplate without withdrawing vessels in Allied Trade, and at the cost of leaving in their service the i million tons d.w. of Norwegian vessels which we hoped to get under the Norwegian Agreement, the extent of American assistance which they might give, on their present military programme and on their present view of their trade requirements, may be taken as 500,000 tons dvw, equivalent to a reduction of, say if million tons in the above general estimate.The reduction of American Trade certainly offers some, though perhaps not very great scope.   If we take, say, another 500,000 tons d.w. or a further li million tons off the deficit we have probably arrived at the best we can hope for without cutting down the military programme.The general result would in that event be -Deficit
Deficit as shewn above12,000,000tonsDeduct by economies in French tonnage&quot;        500,000 tons d.w. from AmericaM     &quot; 500,000 tons d.w,.if America willcomb out her trade1,000,000 1,750,000it1,750,0007,500,000 tonsThis would still leave the deficit to fall on British imports considerably more than the 6,000,000 tons.The only further assistance from America would apparently be at the expense of her military expedition. To estimate the effect of obtaining tonnage at this cost it may be estimated roughly, on the basis of English experience that for every 100 ships withdrawn (or say for every 2,000,000 tons So knocked off the import deficit) 200,000 American troops trained and ready to fight would have to be left behind.(Inta,)J.
