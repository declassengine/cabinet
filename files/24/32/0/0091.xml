QUESTION OF MAKING THE MUNITIONS OF *AR ACTS BINDINGUPON THE CROM.T&quot;.ith reference to the Report of the Conference between the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Munitions and the Financial Secretary to the Admiralty circulated to the Cabinet on this subject (G.T.2656).    I should like to make an observation on the procedure suggested.It is proposed that the Acts should be made binding upon the Grown, with which I entirely agree, with the possible exception of the Royal Dockyards, and the procedure suggested on Page 2 of the Memorandum seems adequate for this purpose.It is    proposed, however, that the Government itself should not take action, in the first place, but should wait for an amendment by the Labour Party.       with this, I am strongly in disagreement.    If we make up our minds to take this course, it appears to me to be both wise and advantageous that the initiative should come from us, otherwise we should appear to be doing it under pressure and not of the Governmentrs own volition.I sincerely hope therefore that the Cabinet will instruct those concerned to take the necessary action on behalf of the Government,C.ADDISON.20th November, 1917.
