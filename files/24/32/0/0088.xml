HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY. OF HIS BRITANNICMJESTYfS GOTO^M^.SECRET,cabi1stet.G.T P688 &quot;&quot;&quot;     *IviATIiRNITY AND CHILD WELFARE.Copy of a letter from British Medical Association to Secretary, War Cabinet.20th November, 1917.Sir,I am directed to place before you on behalf of the British Medical Association the expression of the opinion unanimously arrived at by the Committee which has been considering the -subject of a Ministry of Health, namely, that It would be mos  expedient to grant to local authorities under the supervision of the Local Government Board (as it now is) the new powers which it has been proposed to give them in connection with Maternity and Child Welfare.In making this representation it is desired to meet in advance the accusation that has been made against other bodies which have made a similar protest, namely, that they are act-uated by a desire to protect certain supposed vested interests and have little or no regard for the saving of maternal and child life which it is hoped will follow from the proposed new legislation.   The Association yields to no body in its desire to forward measures designed to promote the welfare of the mothers and infants of the country.   But it believes that it would be most unfortunate If important new powers such as those mentioned above were, given only &quot;to the present local authorities and under the aegis of the Local Government Board instead of being directed from the first by a new Central Department, a Ministry of Health which could command the services and the confidence of all local bodies concerned.In the opinion of the Association effective action throughout the country in connection with Maternity and Child Welfare must Involve the provision of domiciliary treatment, and such provision cannot be made by the present local Health Author-ities without seriously affecting the position of Insurance Com-mlttees and prejudicing the question of the extension of the Insurance Act to dependants.     As the Local Health Authorities are the only bodies over whom the Local Government Board has any control for these purposes tho Association would submit that the grant to these bodies of powers in England and Wales similar to those given to the local Authorities in Scotland would prove ineffectual because the existing   machinery for domiciliary medical attendance whMch is essential If the movement is to be really useful is not under their control nor under that of the Local Government Board but under the National Health Insurance organisations.    Even the present activities of the Local Author- I ities in England and Wales in relation to Maternity Centres cannot in the opinion cf the Association be efficient without reference to the position of other local bodies.
The Association greatly fears that the granting of the proposed powers to Local Authorities in England and Wales similar to thoso given to the Scottish Local Health Authorities would give an excuse for delay in dealing at once with what is consid-ered to&apos; be a matter of vastly greater importance, namely, the formation of a new Central Department, a Ministry of Health which shall take the central control of all matters relating to Public Health) which would, therefore, deal with the subject of Maternity and Child Welfare throughout the country as part of a general, and co-ordinated sAheme , and would not be restricted locally in its operations to the agency of the local Authorities over whom alone the Local Government Board has control.The object of the Association in making these represemt-ations is to prevent if possible the launching of a plan, the results of which it believes would be very disappointing, anii to urge on the Government the desirability of pressing forward with a scheme which would put the health legislation and administration Of the country on a sound and logical basis affecting not only Maternity and Child Welfare work but every other project for dealing with the physical well-being of the community.I have tho honour to be , Sir,Your obedient servant,(Signed)   Alfred Cox.Medical Secretary.Lt. Col. Sir Maurice Kankey, K.C.B.. 2, Whitehall Gardens, S-W.1.
