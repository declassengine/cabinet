Direct hits were observed on the railway at Jiljulie and on the oil factory. Four of our seaplanes have been lost, but the pilots were rescued.The special service vessel &quot; Puma &quot; has been torpedoed and sunk by enemy sub- Casualty marines.ATTACK UPON ENEMY SUBMARINES.During the week under review 10 large enemy submarines have been out, of which 5 Submarines to 7 have been operating to the West of the British Islands, one in the vicinity of the North operating. Cape, and one, the &quot; submarine cruiser &quot; previously referred to, off the Cape Verde Islands, lhere has also been some activity to the West of Gibraltar and off the Yorkshire Coast.(C757)   55   11/17   h&amp;S

Submarines possibly sunk are not included.Although no submarines are yet known to have been destroyed during the week, an enemy submarine has been located on the bottom in the vicinity of Daunt Rock ; il is not at present determined whether she was sunk by depth charges or through striking a mine.In addition one submarine is now known to have been rammed by a British Steamship in the week ending lGth September.   This has not previously been reported.MERCANTILE LOSSES BY ENEMY ACTION.Number The following is a Comparative Statement of the Number and Tonnage of all Merchauand Vessels sunk in recent weeks by enemy action : Tonnage of all Vessels lost.Losses of British steamships in trades.

The figures in respect of Allied and Neutral vessels are not so satisfactory, and for the first time exceed the British losses ; but the total of all vessels lost by enemy action during the week is, both as regards number and tonnage, considerably lower than in any week since the commencement of unrestricted submarine warfare.The table in Appendix I shows in detail the numbers and tonnage of sailings and of losses by submarine and mine, and the percentage of losses to sailings of British Merchant steamships of over 500 tons gross register ; and the table in Appendix JI shows by trades as regards such ships the percentage of tonnage sunk by submarine and mine to tonnage sailing to and from United Kingdom ports during the last three weeks.
.4157From these tables it appears that only one vessel of over 500 tons has this week been lost in overseas trade, and the percentage of losses to sailings shows a large reduction on the previous week and is also the lowest on record. It will also be observed from the figures in Appendix II that the percentage of losses to sailings in overseas trade has progressively declined during the last three weeks, and in each case has been less than one-half of the figure for the preceding week. This is so far good, but the circumstances have been exceptional and undue optimism must be guarded against.The table in Appendix III is a comparative statement of ail British Merchant Vessels Areas in qnnlr damaged or molested, and of all Allied and Neutral Merchant Vessels sunk in the whicho U IJ-xv j fc) &apos; r n  i * 1&quot; VGSS61S lostlast two weeks by enemy craft and by mine according to areas.The following statement shows the number and gross tonnage of all Merchant Vessels Compara lost by enemy action in each month since the commencement of the unrestricted submarine tiye operations of the enemy :-British Merchant 1917.

Of these 2,345. with an aggregate tonnage T?e,01?&quot; of 5,681,456, were British vessels. ,J1&quot;uak ol(C 757) . A 2war.
DailyAverage of British tonnage attacked.The following table shows the average daily tonnage of British Merchant Vessels which was sunk or damaged by enemy action, or which escaped from attack, for each month since the unrestricted submarine warfare commenced, standardised by taking 100 as the daily average for February in each case: -  Month.

The large reduction in the tonnage attacked is due in a great measure to the successful development of the Convoy system.ENEMY MINES.Minelaying. The only area in which minelaying activity of the enemy has this week been experienced is the Harwich area where, on the 11th November, immediately before the arrival of the inward Dutch convoy, two channels were found to have been mined. The convoy was diverted through safe waters, but a steamer not in convoy was sunk. During the week-three cases have been reported of mines being cut by mine protection gear fitted to ships.The number of mines destroyed this week is small and evidences a considerable reduction in the enemy&apos;s minelaying activities.Casualties. The following table shows the number of Enemy Mines destroyed and British Vesselssunk by mine in Home Waters in recent weeks : -Week Ended.	Number of Enemy Mines Destroyed.

During the week 735 ships have been convoyed as compared with 823 last week.Of the 735 ships convoyed, 319 were engaged in the French Coal Trade and 183 on the Scandinavia Lerwick Humber route, the remaining 233 being engaged on overseas trade, 118 inward and 115 outward. There is only one loss in convoy this week, the s.s. &quot; Ardglamis,&quot; in the through convoy from Milford to Gibraltar, having been torpedoed and sunk.Defensive armament.During the week 33 Merchant Vessels have been fitted to take defensive armament the number at present fitted being 3,415.The number of guns now available amounts to 3,097.Offensive The number of Howitzers and Bomb-throwers delivered during the week is 34, makingarmament,  the total delivered to date 262.Mine pro- During the week 50 Merchant Ships have been fitted with Otter equipment, bringingtectiongear. the total number so fitted up to 757.

None have arrived at or.left Rotterdam.The Schooner &quot;Lutece,&quot; which was reported as being off Mopeha, Society Group, Raiders, ii the 5th September, appears to have proceeded westward and from the 12th to 26th Jctober was off Niue Island in the Tonga Group.The States :-U.S. WARSHIP CONSTRUCTION, following table indicates the present warship building programme of the United	Number in pro-gramme.

Between Venice and Brindisi there are only two harbours, Ancona and Bari, and these are not suitable for any but small craft.Should Venice fall, the Austrian fleet will be left in undisputed possession of the Northern Adriatic, and they will be able to repeat with impunity the raids on the eastern coast of Italy which frequently took place in the earlier stages of the war. On the other hand, the withdrawal of this force to the southern end of the Adriatic should help to improve the efficacy of the Otranto Barrage.After the evacuation of Grado, two Italian floating batteries, armed with 15-inch guns, were driven ashore at Cortelazzo at the mouth of the Piave on 29th October. It is not known if they have been saved.
Russia.The naval situation in the Eastern Baltic is unchanged. The Bolsheviks have throughout been supported by at least a section of the Baltic fleet the cruiser &quot; Aurora,&quot; the training ship &quot; Zara Svobody,&quot; and two destroyers took part in the attack on the Winter Palace, and sailors were landed to assist the Extremist element.A telegram from Murmansk (Arctic) states that all is quiet there, but that as a, result of the political upheaval the local Committee of &quot; &quot;Workmen and Sailors&apos; Delegates &quot; has now assumed the government of the port. The Russian Senior Naval OfhVer continues to administer affairs under the Committee&apos;s orders.United States and Japan in the Pacific.Jt is reported that naval co-operation between U.S.A. and Japan has been discussed with the Ishii Mission, with good results. The apparent effect in the Pacific is the with-drawai by the U.S. of the light cruisers &quot; Cincinnati &quot; and &quot; Galveston &quot; from China waters, and the despatch by Japan of the cruiser &quot; Tokiwa &quot; to Honolulu for tho patrol of Hawaiian waters.Hawaii is of great strategical importance in the Pacific; it is a U.S. outpost, with ;i very large Japanese population. The relegation of the patrol of its waters by the U.S.A. to the Japanese navy may be taken as evidence that the understanding between the two countries is one in which the former puts some confidence. Owing to the withdrawal of &quot; Cincinnati &quot; and &quot; Galveston,&quot; Admiral Knight will not be able to assume responsibility for the patrol of the Torres Strait Banka Strait trade route, and has informed C-in-C. China that he can only deal with the waters of the Philippine Islands.Naval Staff,15th November, 1917.[Appendices.
