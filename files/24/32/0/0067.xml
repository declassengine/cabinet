c e c n g-   rpWAR   CAB 183812667HIT. Balfour,As you will no doubt remember, the War Cabinet recently had before them a letter from Viscount Bryce to the Prime Minister,  (G.T. 2295),  covering a memorial from a number of representative public men,  suggesting the establishment of a small Committee of British and American experts to examine the establishment of some machinery for the preservation of a permanent peace by a combination of free, peace-loving nations.The War Cabinet decided - (V/ar Cabinet 253Minute 17)To adjourn the matter until there had been an opportunity of discussing it with the re-presentative of President Wileon, who was shortly expected in this country.I had an opportunity of discussing thisquestion with Colonel House the other day,.    It was clear to me that in his view it would be a mistake to set up any such Committee.   He told me that the President thought it better that the Government of the United States should not in any way be committed to a cut and dried plan for the establishment of a League of Nations.     The President hoped that if any Nation, showed an aggressive disposition, or clearly intended to go to War, Great Britain, the United States, France and perhaps some other Nations should come-to an understanding between themselves as to what attitude they should adopt and that having come to a decision onCopy of Minute addressed to Mr. Balfour by Sir E. Brymmond..See also Papers G.T,464, C-.T. 484A &amp; .G.T^2293
this point they should then determine&apos; v?hatr^tjeps^Should be taken to make it effective.Colonel House added that the President and he were discouraging in the United States discussions as to the League of Nations, etc., and that he had succeeded in employing a number of advocates of the League on various work immediately connected with the prosecution of the War.(Intd)   E.D.Foreign Office, S.W. 1.,November 15th, 1917.
