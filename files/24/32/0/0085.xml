(This Document is the Property ofHis Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.)Intelligenoe Bureau,SECRET.Department of Information. G/2Special MemorandumonUnrest in the Dutoh Bast Indies.The size, richness and importance of the Dutch Colonies in Bsia are not always realised.    Approximately they oover 735.000 square miles with a population of about 50 millions, of whioh some 74.000 are Dutch.    They include some of the largest andrichest islands in the world viz :   Java and Madiera, Sumatra,Celebes, the Moluccas, part of Borneo and the Timor Archipelago.The Government is in the hands of a Governor-General and Council nominated by the Queen.    He may pass laws and regulations for the administration of the Colony, but his power is limited by the &quot;Regulations for the Government of Netherlands India 1854&quot; and of course by the States-General in Holland.Under tho Governor-General there are a large number of Residents assisted by a hierarchy of Dutoh and native officials.     There are further a considerable number of self-governing native States, the relations of whioh to the Dutch Authorities may be roughly compared to similar relations existing in British India.For defence purposes there is an army of about 40.000 men, about one fourth of whom are Europeans, and a small navy of about 2500 Europeans and 50 small ships.The last statistics of Revenue showed a deficit of about *f of pounds sterling.
- s -The conies are very fefctile and prodube great quantities of tobacco, coffee, tea, cinchona, rubber,*oocoa and petroleum. Nearly feur-fifths of these are exported, to Holland.     Opium, salt and pawnbroking are Government monopolies.     There are also im-pertant coal deposits in Java, Sumatra and Borneo.     Europeans are tried by Dutch Law.   Natives (including Chinese, British Indians etc) natives of other Asiatic countries by religious law which is Islamic in oharaoter and ia administrated by prie 3te under Dutoh control.     In the self-governing states the looal laws prevail but barbarous punishments are prohibited and the powers of the chiefs are limited.. Unrest.There seems to be no doubt that in the principal Xtotch Colony (Java) there is, among the native population,a considerable amount of unrest.     As in India this appears to take the form of a desire for a greater measure of self-government, &quot;but unlike India, the malcontents do not wish to do away with an alien over-lordship, &quot;but rather substitute Dutch rule for that of some other and perhaps greater Power.It is clear that the present war has shown the Netherlands Authorities that their tenure in Java and their other far-eastem possessions is highly insecure.    Tkey could not hope to defend their colonies either against Great Britain or Japan.     This power-lessness is patent to the looal authorities and to the less ignerant of their native subjects and can hardly strengthen Dutoh prestige. As far as one oan judge from the latest available Dutoh Yearbook&apos; the Celonial administration doos its best to administer the laws in an equitable manner, to prevent abuses and t* improve eduoation. It is. however, oertain that Java aspocially is exploited in the interests of the rich middlo class in Holland and that the wolfaro
of the natives, although not neglected, is a secondary consideration. It is a notorious faot that many of the leading Butch Commercial magnates (Mr. Cremer, Mr. van Aalste*-) have returned from the Indies in middle life with vast fortunes accumulated from speeula-tions in tohacvco, ooffee etc, and that there is a class in Holland who may be said te batten on the East Indies.Muhammadanlsra is very strong in Java, and wherever that religion is found there will always be a Mo11ah to whom all look for guidance.     This religious authority is found in Java in the person of Mul&amp;ah Chokro Bonoto, the head of an anti-Dutch and semi-seorot society known as the Sarikat-Islam.     It is supported among other native rulers by the Rajah of Solo.It was stated above that the desire of the native agitations was direoted net tc aoquire independence but to substitute for Dutch dominion that of another Alien Power.    What that Power is is not far to seek.     It is Japan.     The Japanese are carrying tn their propaganda with their oustomary efficiency and In three principal ways(1)     By gradually increasing their hold ever the trade of the Island.(2)    By indueing Javanese students to visit Tokie University where they receive exceptionally oourteous treatment. (3)    By flooding the Islands and especially Java with agents many of whom ara military officers.     The Japanese is perhapo the best ef all spios.     He will remain for years in the humblest situations if by so daing he can benefit his country.     Instanoea of this must tie known by any one who has given attention to this subject.A further element of unrest Is a oonsiderable number ef British Indian maloontents who are present in   the Dutoh Indies
20. 11. 17.under assumed names.     These are connected with the Germano-Turkish anti-British p&amp;opaganda which has vftr seme tide been rife in Java especially among the Arabs.     It does not seem prtbable that the disloyal British Indians can do very muoh harm, but it is by nn means oertain that they are net to seme extent encouraged by that section of the Japanese race whise watchword is &quot;Asia fer the Asiatios&quot;.The feeling of the Javanese towards Greit Britain appeare to be good and there is a ourious mania, among the Arabs especially, for learning English, perhaps chiefly as a means of bettering their trade oenneotion, the British importations being sec6nd to those of the mother-country.     It is Stated on good authority that the Dutch Authorities prohibit the publication of war-news in the very nu-merous native newspapers and that the result of this is a grcwing feeling that all is not wall with Germany.The undoubted aotivity of the Japanese in the Dutch East indies is signifioant and seems to point to a possible change of ownership at no distant date.    After the termination of the present wal? there will bo no great Powers oxeept Breat Britain and the United States who will be in a poaitien to dispute such ownership with Japan, and it is doubtful whether either of.those nations would go to the rescue of the Dutch Possessions.     It is hardly noo^asary to say that tho lose of some of the richest countries in the world would be a orushing blow tc Holland and her commercial prosperity.
