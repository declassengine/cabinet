7SECRET.THE ACCEPTANCE OF FOREIGN CONTRACTS INRELATION TO MAN-POWERNote by the Minister of National Service.I desire to answer very shortly the Memoranda (G.T.2578 and G.T.2576) of the Minister of Munitions and Sir E. Wyldbore Smith.Both have I think somewhat mistaken my object in raising the question, upon v/hich I had received urgent representations from the War Office.I did not intend to suggest that the Minister of National Service should be the determining authority on what contracts should or should not be accepted.    But so long as the decision of the War Committee stands, it follows that proposals involving any material call on man-power should bo notified to him, in order that he may be able to gauge the effect upon re-cruiting and upon the general labour supply, and may if necessary be able to make representations before it is too late.Further I submit that the decision of tho War Committee is sound.   Sir E. Wyldbore Smith&apos;s point that contracts are submitted&quot; to the Department interested in the material concerned does not meet the case of contracts involving a large amount of labour.    In such cases the War Office is directly interested in so far as the supply of men for the Army is affected and other Government Departments are also affected so far as the execution of the contracts deplete the generalr

Mr. Churchillfs own Department has rightly insisted before the Labour Priority Committee upon the necessity of treating surplus labour as a common pool.While appreciating, as pointed out in my Memorandum, the economic advantages of supplying the United States Forces, it is essential that this Ministry should knew the extent to which this is to be carried out, as it directly affects the number of men who can be taken for military service; and the plans of the general staffs for the coming year must necessarily depend on knowing as early as possible the number of reinforcements upon which they can count.I very much regret that Mr. Churchill should have interpreted my observations as an attack upon himself. While accepting entirely the necessity of every accommodation with America, I must confess that I am not convinced that it is economically sound to use 30,000 tons of steel in the construction of hospital huts, in view of the War Office experience that these can be built satisfactorily with concrete and a small quantity of wood.
