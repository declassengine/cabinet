Colonel ilonerhis document is the property of His Britannic Majestyxe Government).WAR     0 A B I N E T.SEC R ET*- .      .,. .i mm   UMili n mG.T.26S3, THE   IRISH   CONVENTION.Minute by the Chief Secretary for Ireland,The proceedings of the Convention are at a stage when conclusions for good or ill may shortly be expected.The past three weeks have found representatives of Ulster and the South hard at work upon proposals as to the constitution of an Irish parliament and the formulation of a fiscal system upon terms which might secure the assent of the North. Eastern community as well as of the Southern Unionists and the Nationalists.   Progress was made to the extent that a Parliament of two houses was discussed in which the seats should be so allotted that a joint session there might be equilibrium between the Nationalist and Unionist elements, fiscal proposals were outlined under which control of Customs would be reserved to the Imperial Parliament for a term of years, collection to be in a Joint Board representative of the Imperial and the Local Governments, and the Irish contribution to imperial expenditure (an ascertained sum) to be charged upon the product of the duties of customs.I am informed that proposals on the lines above indicated could probably be so framed as to secure the assent of the Southern Unionists, the Nationalists and the majority of the nominated members, but that there is no present prospect of the concurrence of the group whic h specifically represents Ulster.   Should this be so the immediate result will be failure of agreement in theSub-Committee
20th November, 1917.sub-committee, followed in a few days If a breakdown is averted as I think it may be by Debate in the Grand Committee and ultimat in the Convention on these crucial questions the solution of whie will determine the success or failure of the Convention.   On the various subordinate questions other sub-committees which have bee at work recently have, I am told, made excellent progress toward agreement.   The temper of all parties is still reported also to be good, notwithstanding necessary differences.In the circumstances known to me I should regard inability to come to an understanding, if the parties could find common ground in the directions indicated above, as a lamentable failure, and I bring the facts as I am informed of them to the knowledge of the War Cab?.net,(a) to suggest cors:\c.eraiicn of the question whether encouragement can be given by m:.nisterial action of any kind to a fti-se spirit cf compromise, and(b) to point out that before thec limax of the efforts of the Convention is reached it will be necessary to prepare for the possible alternative of success or failure, and in particular if failure becomes inevitable, to determine what new declaration ought thereupon to be made of the intensions of the Government with regard to the question of Home Rule.The course to be taken at the close of the Convention may perhaps be decisive as to whether there shall be a new Rising in Ireland and as to the nature of the relations of Great Britain and Ireland for a long tim*3 to come.(Signed) H. E.. Duke.
