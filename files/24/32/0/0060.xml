mSECRET.Intelligence Bureau,Department of Information.BAW/020.Weekly Report on Austria-Hungary. XX. (17th November, 1917.)The internal situation in Austria-Hungary has for the last fortnight been quite overshadowed by the tremendous victory over Italy: but while allowing to the full for the elation and improved moral which victory has produced, xe may at least console our-selves by remembering that nothing can conceal the gravity of the internal situation in the Dual Monarchy, not merely from the economic and financial, but also from the political point of view. Of this ample proof could be added to the summaries already given in previous reports.The press of Vienna and Budapest naturally gloats over what is described as &quot;Italy&apos;s Sedan&quot; and &quot;the collapse of a great military Power&quot;.     The general view is that it is just punishment for a traitor.     The Austrian General Staff publishes a calcula-tion according to which each square kilometre acquired by the Italians cost them 5,400 men: &quot;in seven days we have occupied ten times as much ground as the Italians in two-and-a-half years.&quot;The reports of the various war correspondents throw con-siderable light on what is openly described as &quot;the complete demoralisation of the Italian troops&quot;.     The Italian officers are described as having completely lost their heads, and there are descriptions of the grotesque effect produced by captured regiments of Arditi (picked regiments pledged never to surrender). The ffeue Ereie Presse and other papers are full of reminiscences of the great Marshal Radetzky&apos;s victories in 1849, of the warn-ings of former Italian statesmen and diplomats against an
22Uaggressive policy, and of extracts from Baron Sonnino&apos;s speeches thirty years ago.The deb&amp;cle is generally represented as a fearful blow to the Entente.    While the Entente waits till America is ready next spring, &quot;the Central Powers,&quot; we are told, &quot;do not feel hound to wait with them, hut have again assumed the initiative&quot;.    Mr. Lloyd George1 b promise to Italy is of course treated as worthless. The railway connections are most unfavourable, it is argued, and the material lose of nine hundred guns cannot be replaced by a wave of the hand.Above all, every effort is being made to  poison public opinion against England   and indirectly to influence Italian opinion in this direction.    The Entente is represented as trying to force an unhappy country still deeper into the mire, and Italy as having been reduced to a mere province under the English yoke. There is as usual in the leading organs of opinion offensive abuse of British statesmen.    Till recently Mr. Lloyd George was their ohief target, then Mr. Asquith came in for much abuse, and now it is Lord Robert Cecil&apos;s turn.     &quot;Ke has once more made the coarsest utterances,&quot; the Neue Preie Presse tells us, &quot;and it is only necessary to listen to him in order to know what the most evil tendency of the Entente demands. n     It is interesting to note that the argument that &quot;Italy can only be a side-show&quot; - alleged to be widely prevalent in England - is treated as &quot;an obvious confession of weakness&quot;.    There is the usual attempt to represent Britain as actuated solely by commercial motives and likely soon to be reduced to splendid isolation again: &quot;in England it is being whispered that the war can no ionger be made to pay and that is in England a sentence of death&quot; (Neue Preie Presse. November 7).Saner opinions are to be found, as ever, in the Radical Zeit and the Socialist Arbeiter Zeitung.     The former insists that
Austria&apos;s war aims still remain the same, and condemns all idea of &quot;dictating peace&quot;.     The latter points out that Italy is not in a position to make a separate peace, being more dependent on England than Russia ever con be.     It argues, however, that the Russian democracy will now have an eager fellowchampion of peace in the Italian people, and that the influences for peace inside the Entente will thereby be strengthened, and Imperialistic tendencies correspondingly weakened.     But this makes it the more essential that the Central Powers should not demand more after victory than before it.The Real State of Feeling.     Meanwhile there is private in-formation that no flags were hoisted in Austria, and that the masses rather bewail the victories, as tending to prolong the war. This fits in entirely with the facts of the situation.     The desire for peace is universal, and is increased below by suffering and above by resentment at the country&apos;s dependence upon Germany.Economic conditions in Austria are exceedingly grave.     The lack of fodder is forcing many stockbreeders to kill off their animals: yet leather is scarcer than ever.     The restrictions on beer have now been carried to such lengths, owing to the agri-cultural shortage, that the output is now only 6 per cent of the output of 1911-13 (instead of 25 per cent till this summer); Reliable internal evidence shows that conditions vary greatly -the rich agricultural districts of Bohemia (which are fortunately also the Czech districts), Croatia and Central Hungary^ being still tolerably well supplied with food, while there is literal famine in the mountainous and less fertile districts - Istria, Bosnia, German-Bohemia.     In Vienna and other large towns the Queue system is disorganising the whole daily life of the people and working havoc with health and morals.Birth Rate and Disease.     Published statistics of thirty Austrian towns show an alarming decrease of births and increase of
deaths.     In Vienna itself the number of births dropped from 637 in one week of August 1914 to 448 in the corresponding week of 1916, while the deaths rose from 522 to 668.     The headquarters of the chief workmen1s friendly society of Vienna have also published statistics which show the increase of illness and disease among the population: of its own members, 2,400 out of 10,000 fell ill in 1915, and 2,900 in 1916.     Its medical officers note the increase of tuberculosis, venereal disease, diseases of circulation and digestion, and, as a special &quot;war-illness&quot;, swelling of the hands and feet, and general anaemia and exhaustion. Tfrey also note the number of accidents among women employed in war industries.Dr. Victor Adler, in hie opening address at the Socialist Congress in Vienna, alluded movingly to the prevailing misery. &quot;When we walk in tho streets and look at the passers-by - the women so exhausted and bowed under their burdens, although they have indeed very little to carry home, and v/hen we look at the children, then we must confess that it needs great confidence ... ... to keep us from losing hope in the future.&quot;The grave situation due to lack of clothing materials has been referred to in previous reports.     The supply of thread has almost entirely given out: and many tailors only undertake repairs if the customer can bring his own thread.     The Zeit in all serious-ness prints the suggestion that, with a view to economy, corpses should no longer be buried in their clothes.A sure clue to prevailing conditions is provided by the feuilletonists.     One writer in a light article &quot;On Getting Thin&quot;, describes how the man who is afraid of getting thin ia no longer to be found in Austria, and how everyone&apos;s clothes hang loose on them]Count Traun, President of the Austrian Red Cross, speaking in the Upper House, alluded to the scandals and chaos connected with
i      i ! 207t- 5 -discharged and invalided soldiers, many of whom are, he said, to be seen daily begging on the Ringstrasse and KaVrnthnerstraese (the Piccadilly and Bond Street of Vienna).-The desperate conditions amply explain any lack of enthusiasm over the successes in Italy, and also the acute resentment against Hungary which is openly vented on all sides, owing to the very marked difference in the economic position of the two countries -and&quot;the restrictions imposed by Budapest.     This culminated in a debate in the Austrian Parliament, in which Hungary was roundly abused for her hoarding policy from all parts of the House.     The comments of the Viennese press were no less stiff, and even the Neue Freie Presse, generally so Magyarophil, went so far with the current as to bring down on its head the demand of a Jingo Hungarian deputy for its exclusion from Hungary.     Last not least the Mayor of Vienna, Dr. Weiskirchner, one of the Christian Socialist leaders, made a public attack of extreme violence upon the Hungarian Government.The comparatively mild reply of Count Hadik, the Hungarian ?ood Minister, is in such contrast with the usual official attitude in Hungary towards Austria, as to suggest internal weakness and indeed a certain dependence upon Austrian products.     He admitted that Hungary had sent only 250,000 cv/t. inotoai^ -of 55Q. of food-stuffs to Austria in 1917 instead of 350,000 in the corresponding period of 1916: but he maintained that there v/as no real surplus available in Hungary, and that &quot;merely to please the Austrian deputies we cannot take the last mouthful out of the mouths of our own people&quot;.     There would appear to be negotiations behind the scenes between the two Governments, but popular feeling runs high, and even the German-Nationalists of Austria are openly abusing the Magyars, while the Czechs play the tertius gaudens.There are numerous confused attempts to reorganise the Germa parties since the collapse of the National Union: but so far without
success.     Indeed, one of the deceased Union&apos;s component groups, ifte Deutsche Arbeitsgerneinsohaft, has   in its turn fallen to pieces partly owing to Jingo attacks on one of its promiaBnt members, professor Redlich (the well-known authority on English constitution-al law), who criticised the submarine policy and favoured a con-ciliatory policy towards the Slavs.Finance.   The speech delivered by the Minister of Finance in Parliament, with its frank references to inflation, shows the financial situation of Austria to be desperate.     Credit is very shaky, and there are masses of paper money.     As outspoken critics point out, the bureaucracy reckoned on a short war, and with a view to evading all control, dispensed with Parliament altogether: when at last this fatal path was abandoned, it was already too late to repair the evil.A Socialist Project of Reform.     There has been an important Congress of German-Austrian Socialists in Austria, which passed resolutions in favour of transforming Austria into a State of federated nationalities.     The foundation of the new project should be the abolition of the 17 provinces or &quot;Crownlands&quot; and the substitution of &quot;district (Kreis-) autonomy&quot;.     There ia a vague reference to the Dual System, which must not be allowed to stand in the way of reform: but otherwise no attempt is made to face the fundamental difficulty that none of the non-German races (their Socialists included) will accept any scheme which docs not break down the Dualist barrier and unite the racial fragments which it keeps artificially apart.     It none the less is a serious proposal (based upon the profound studies of Karl Renner and Otto Bauer) and is honestly meant by its promoters.Meanwhile the Czech Socialists have reorganised their party, and definitely adopted the programme of Csecho-Slovak independence as their own.The Czech leader, Dr. ICramar&apos;, who can now claim to have all
Czech parties behind him. hae publicly repudiated the suggestion that the nation will accept a lesser programme.Hungarian Politics.&apos;As has been already indicated in earlier reports, Dr. Wekerle&apos; Government is in almost as insecure a political position as its predecessor: and it is more and more difficult to believe that its chief will succeed in the task of reform, the execution of which was his excuse for taking office. or a month past there has been a chronic condition of crisis, and not all the tact and talent for manoeuvring displayed by Dr. Wekerle has availed to dispel the atmosphere of recrimination and mutual party abuse.   Parliament has been the scene of several highly important debates, in which the speeohes have been on an unusually high level, and several new men have come to the front. But the chief feature has been a series of more or less veiled overtures between Wekerle and Tisza, varied by a few resounding knocks.     There is a kind of war of positions going on between the two-men, Tisaa now openly advocating the idea of &quot;concentration&quot; -which means a compromise on the questions of electoral reform -and Wekerle remaining conciliatory even under provocation.During the last days of October the crisis in Parliament reached a head.     The Premier found it necessary to defend Mr. Vazsonyi, who had become involved in an undignified squabble with the Minister of Justice (now resigned) against the charge of being a &quot;portfolio hunter&quot;.     The opposition in attacking him v/as acting with the transparent purpose of driving from office the chief champion of electoral reform.     Having failed to separate Vazsonyi from his chief, the next; assault ,.7as delivered against the Minister of the Interior, Iir. Ugron, whose office it is to make preparations for elections - and it is to be remembered that the &quot;making&quot; of elections in Hungary is even more important than the elections
fthemselves.     A question put to him in the House by Count Tisza with regard to measures taken against some prominent local officials, led to an exciting scene.     Tisza declined to accept the Minister&apos;s explanation and described his action as &quot;the ugliest political per-secution&quot;: and on a vote the Government was defeated.Tisza has never been a skilful tactician, and this time he seems to have gone too far.     The breach between the Government and the Conservative elements was deepened: the democrats rallied in its defence, and Karolyi and his small group were especially active in favour of Ugron.     The press was full of urgent appeals to the effect that such dissensions could only encourage Hungary&apos;s ene?nies: and the incident was at last closed by an explanation of Count Tisza in the House in which he declared that his party had had no intention of voting lack of confidence in the Government. Thus the actual government parties have closed their ranks, but the breach with the opposition has widened: and in the meantime Dr. Sfekerle has succeeded in alienating the Socialists - who, it is true, are unrepresented in Parliament   and do not count in the country aa a v/hole, but represent a real force among the working classes of the capital. - by his criticism of v/orkmen&apos;s organisations and by various official measures connected with food distribution.In short, the position of the Cabinet is anything but secure, and it is by no means certain whether it will have the strength required to enforce so vital and contentious a measure as electoral reform   through Parliament in the teeth of Tisza and his well-disciplined party.     The latter&apos;s resistance is all the more formidable because it is fighting for its very existence, resting as it does upon a narrow franchise and grossly faked elections. Tisza himself in one of his latest speeches quite openly described electoral reform as &quot;the sword of Damocles&quot;, argued that universal suffrage tends everywhere to strengthen the extreme elements gnd expressed his doubt as to whether &quot;the Magyar elements will remain
strong enough in individual constituencies to hold the loyal section of the nationalities under its political influence&quot;.     Here he went to the root of the whole matter.     Anything approaching real electoral reform is impossible without bringing added strength to the non-Magyar elements in the country.     Tisza and his friends therefore quite logically oppose an extension of the franchise. The parties opposed to Tisza contend that they can fake the reform to the disadvantage of the non-Magyars, while strengthening those elements in the Magyar population which are likely to support the Independence parties rather than the old &quot;Liberals&quot; (really Conservative landowners) of Tisza.From admissions in Dr. WekerlefB spseches in the House it is clear that the shortage of oil and coal is being very seriously felt in Hungary, in the factories and elsewhere, though he claimed that it was being met from Austria and Germany.     The paper crisis has btcome so acute that the Hungarian newspapers at the boginning of November were suddenly reduced to eight pages each and the Premier had to admit that there was only a week&apos;s paper in the country.The speculations on the Budapest Bourse are greater than ever. Dr. Wekerle claims to have taken measures to meet the evil by restrictions on dividends and on the increase of capital in limited companies: but the ex-Minister of Finance, VL. Teleszky, in a very weighty speech, threw grave doubts upon the success of these aeasures.
