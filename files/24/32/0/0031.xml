v \ BOAKD OP AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES.\1    1   if .   -----   .....V    /^Report for week ended 14th November, 1917.&apos;   V ,,r  m -u i     i    i  -i I IIM  I&quot;!J if W*i -.  Hit       S&quot;*^ *- ^^.-tThe President and Secretariat continue to he very fully occupied in dealing with numerous minor emergencies, arising partly out of the campaign for an increased home production of food and partly out of the present&apos;artificial conditions   of supply and demand ae they affect agriculture.     Close attention is also being given as opportunity affords, to problems of reconstruction, and especially to the settlement of sailors and soldiers on the land after the war.The pressure of work on the staff of the Board is so great, and forthcoming developments of the agricultural situation are so important, that Kr. Prothero is about to write to the Ministry of National Service with a view to securing the return of some 7 or 8 of the 24 7 members of tho staff who have been released for service in the Navy or Army.The normal work of the Department proceeds on lines indicated in previous reports.FISHERIES DIVISION.ADMINISTRATIVE SECTION.Tho Board have opened half   of Start Bay to trawling, but &apos; difficulties have already arisen owing to poaching by Brixham boats in the closed portion.The Board have been in communication with the Admiralty regarding new Orders affecting fishing operations and have secured permission for certain new boats at Lowestoft to be allowed to fish for some further time before bein^ taken up for Naval Service.The questions arising from th.3 raising of Chester and Powick Weirs in order to obtain water power and thus save coal have further been dealt with.There has been a large amount of correspondence regarding ordinary fishtry administrative business, and in connection with the obtaining of fish from American waters.PERMIT SECTION.Permits to fish have been granted in favour of 24 commercial and 8 amateur fishing vessels.     73 permits have been cancelled.Under a revised Admiralty Order relating to the nationality of crews of British fishing vessels, arrangements have been made for the submission to Senior Naval Officers at the ports concerned of the names of selected fishermen subjects of neutral countries with a view to their employment on fishing vessels.
HSHERMM&apos; S. REGISTRATION AND RECRUITING SECT I (IT.Fishermen and Naval Service. The Admiralty will deferindefinitely the caTl of skippers and enginemen in the fishing convoys of Grimsby, provided that these men are released if selected for call as soon a3 substitutes can be found.     The Board are obtaining inforration with regard to Grimsby skippers and mates who are at present unemployed., and are willing to accept employment, and are advising these men to enrol in the Special Fishing Reserve.The muster rolls of East Coast crews desiring to proceed for the western herring fishing are being collected with a view of according them such favourable treatment as justice to other fishermen permits, in order to facilitate large landings from the operations of these boats.Fishermen, Fish Trade and Military Service,     Census forms have been collected from the fvsh&quot; trade at Grimsby which embrace all shore workers regularly employed in that industry, and these are under examination.     It is hoped that they will throw light upon the possibility of further co-operation in the trade, and so assist the Board to determine whether such co-operation can be utilised to release further men for Military Service without unduly prejudicing the food supply and the fishing industry.     It is hoped to extend these enquiries to other ports.Suggestions have been made to members of the.National Fish, Poultry, Game and Rabbit Trade Association as to a possible procedure for the selection of men to act upon Advisory Committees to advise Tribunals in the case of members of the retail trade brought before them.     The need of authoritative and impartial information.as to the facts concerning applications received from the fish trade for support before Tribunals has been keenly felt by... the Board.:  MOTOR LOAN COMMITTEE.Several trials have been run during the past week, notably one at St. Ives.     In this boat the Committee installed a make of engine which is entirely new to the port.The motor fishing-boat is already very well established at St. Ives, but up to the present installations have not been carried out on a scientific engineering basis.As is their invariable custom,  the Committee1s engineers designed a propeller specially, having duo regard to the boat and the class of fishing to be undertaken.     Local boat-owners and experts were free in voicing their opinion that the propeller was much too large to be turned by an engine of the power.     The trials, however, proved the very reverse to   be the case, and the boat is a complete success and as fast as anything, Jil&quot;the port.Up to the present the majority of fishermen have been accustomed to seeing a standard propeller fitted to any boat. Now, however, at St. Ives they have seen a properly designed screw, and the excellent performance of the boat will be attributed to a scientific blending of engine, propeller and boat into
an harmonious whole.   Thus have the Committee provided an object lesson on the practical utility of a knowledge of engineering as applied to the installation of power in fishing--boats.FISH POOD COMMITTEE.Stjratting Season. The Fishermen on the East   Coast areshort of boxes;   nearly the whole number of one thousand already purchased have been distributed, and five hundred more have now &quot;been ordered;   second-hand Margarine boxes make suitable receptacles, but the supplies are very short. and arrangements are being made to provide the fishermen with them from the large store held by the Committee at Grimsby.An officer has gone to Brightlingsea to endeavour to find new markets for Sprats.The Board are in correspondence with the Local Government Boari in the hope that Boards of Guardians may be able to take large quantities of surplus fish at cost price,Wood Turnings. Lowestoft and Yarmouth are now fully suppliedand the Committee are arranging to supply merchants at Grimsby. The sacks purchased by the Committee through the Army Contracts Department are being sold at a satisfactory profit.Herrings in the South West.     Large quantities are now being landed at St. Ives, and with the assistance of the Food Controller questions of Railway Transport and suppli.es of materials are engaging attention.Secretary.16th November, 1917.
