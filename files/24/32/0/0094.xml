OPERATIONS.General Plumer, Italy.ToC.I.G.S* tWar Office.Despatched 1.20 p.m.)) 20.11.17.Received     4,0   p.m.)0.29.I have seen Diaz with Foch this morning.    Diaz couldnot give definite answer as to French and English taking over sections of the line but he is sending an official note to us this afternoon.     The principle is apparently accepted that we and the French will assist in holding the line and will have Italian Troops under us, but there are questions as to the accommodation for our troops and equipment for them for mountains. These questions I will go into as soon as I have the note,    I think that we must have the number of our divisions made up to six.     I should like the H.Q&apos;s of the 11th Corps sent on directly after the heavy Artillery which follows the 48th division, and should like the Corps Commander and some of his staff, including Chief Engineer, to come over ah^-ad.     I should like the 47th and 2nd divisions to follow as soon as can be arranged.    I do not think a Cavalry Brigade will be wanted now and I hope that the troops I have named will be all that will be required.    The general situation is certainly better and is improving daily.
