SECRET.Intelligence Bureau,Department of Information.C.U.fiEMORAMDUM ON GEORGIA (CAUCASUS).From the time of Its annexation in 1801 in violation of the Treaty of 1783, the social and political movement in Georgia was to a certain extent under the influence of corresponding movements in Russia.     This naturally came about from the fact that many Georgian young people received their education at Russian universities.     In the early sixties, accordingly, a strong group of Georgian intellectuals advocated the abolition of serfdom, and this became an accomplished fact in 1864.     In the early seventies a vigorous &quot;people1s movement&quot; was inaugurated by the same group of &quot;intellectuals&quot;, whose object was to improve the economio conditions cf the peasantry.     Many Go-operative Societies were formed, as also sohocls and libraries in the villages. Two Agricultural National Banks were established for the purpose of saving the land of the nobility, and gradually transferring it to the small-holders.In the early nineties a small group of Georgian intellectuals, who had received their higher education in the countries of Western Europe, introduced social democratic ideas, which spread very rppidly in spite of the complete absence of an industrial proletariat.      As a result the Revolution of 1904-1905, although at first destructive in character In Georgia as elsewhere throughout the Empire, was perhaps more rapidly constructive there in its results than in any other regien of Russia.   Ne district was as a whole so ready for it intellectually and otherwise.     The principle that the land should belong to the man who can and will work it was put into immediate operation during the years/o
1905-1906.     In short, although the contrast is everywhere exceedingly sharp between Georgian nobility and peasant, yet the difference Georgian races form a nationally homogeneous area stretching from the steppe of Baku to the Black Sea, which has known a political life and organised government of its own in the past, and in that measure constitutes a Caucasian element that has given proof of capacity to conduct its own affairs.   We may accordingly expect that the opportunity of the Revolution of 1917 would not be lost upon Georgia.The Land Question.The relations of the Georgian peasantry and the great landed proprietors which had always been more or less complicated, were not really simplified by the reforms introduced after 1864. As a result of these, the peasants became free village settlers having been able to buy the manorial lands together with vineyards and fruit gardens at a fixed price, whilst the arable and pasture lands were left in the possession of the landowners, and could cnly be rented by the peafeants in agreement with the proprietors. Certainly the Government gave the peasants the right $o redeem such small holdings as they had rented in this way and was even willing to furnish 49 year loans for that purpose.     But the redemption was not compulsory as in Russia and the rate of interest on the loan was fixed so high that very few took advantage of the facility.   Thanks to this t^e great mass of the peasants were utterly landless, or possessors of a tiny holding, or compelled to rent the proprietors1 lands.     Again, after the abolition of serfdom, the peasants were required to show documentary proof of their right to the very small holdings that many of them had been able to acquire even under these conditions.     The number of documents sent
in was so large that the officials postponed their examination indefinitely.   Further, many peasants fearing the possibilities involved in efficial transactions, preferred to deal directly vith the landowners, a course of action which subjected them in many cases to imposition.   Nevertheless, during the period from 1864 to 1910 peasants bought 144,000 desiatines, paying 7,200,000 rubles for them under l^an conditions which have been a heavy burden on them. On the other hand, the nobility gained little from these complicated transactions.   Accustomed to a somewhat care-free yet martial life, irresponsible in temperament yet fond of pomp and show, the Georgian nobility were little adapted to economic life under the new conditions of free-hired labour:   they had little of the spirit of enterprise and capacity for work which characterised the Armenian, v-ho was quick to take advantage of the situation and buy up the bankrupt Georgian estates.The liberating of the peasants coincided with the general cultural awekening, and rebirth of the national consciousness. Papers and magazines were published, and also popular booklets through whitrh the people became familiar with the newer ideas of Tvestem Europe.   But the repressive measures of the seventies and succeeding years made the conditions worse than ever, so that the revolutionary activities of 1904-1906 were particularly directed along agrarian lines in the Caucasus, Indueing still more selling by the impoverished nobility.      Finally in 1911 the viceroy introduced a project for the ocmpulsory sale of land to the peasants which was passed by the Duma.   Under it loans were advanced at &amp;% for 28 years, 5$ for 40 years, and       for 56 years.    Advantage was taken of it by the peasants to purchase 155,744 desiatines at a cost of 7,362,010 rubles.   A land hunger so persistent and so hardly satisfied was boumi to seek satisfaction under conditions
more favourable than any that had hitherto been experienced. Political Parties.The Georgian national, political and economic activities since the revolution of 1004-1905 have resulted in the gradual development of the following political parties.(1) National Democrats, representing the bourgeois classes, landed nobility and large peasant proprietors.   Their aim is to obtain the practical autonomy cf Georgia based on the Treaty already referred to, and enlarged according to the changed political conditions.     Their .ergan is &quot;Sakhartvelo&quot; (The Georgia).(2) National Federalists, who also aim at obtaining political autonomy, and want to establish a Federated Trans-Caucasia, including Tatars and Armenians on the sams m*del as Switzerland. Composed chiefly of small peasant proprietors and Radical Intellectuals, they probably constitute the strongest party numerically.   Their organ Is &quot;Sachalko Pourtseli&quot; (People&apos;s Paper),(3) The National Georgian Social Democratic Party alse aims at obtaining political autonomy for Georgia based on very broad democratic principles.     They aro likewise cerposed chiefly of small peasants and Industrial workmen.   Their trgan is &quot;Alioni&quot; (The Sunrise)-(4) Finally there is a fourth party, numerically the smallest, which considers itself to be a branch of the eld Russian Socialistic Democratic Party.   Their aim Is to ohtain Home Rule for the whole of Trans-Caucasia, Including all the nationalItlea, giving complete freedom in the use of the different languages in the schools and other institutions.    They are very cosmopolitan In their attitude - members of the International - and their representatives, notable members being Tchkheidze and Tseretcli,
have taken an exceedingly active part in the Central Committee of the Workmen&apos;s and Soldiers&apos; Council in Petrograd.After the Revolution of March 1017.In the delegation of authority to the local municipalities by the Provisional Government during the earliest weeks of the Revolution, Georgians held with Russians and Armenians an equal position on the executive committees of the local Dumas that were entrusted with the different branches of administration.     Similarly when the State Duma sent down its 5 Caucasian representatives to act as its Commissioners, Georgians again were brought into equality of representation by the addition of Kons. Chengkeli, a Georgian Social Democrat and representative of the Petrograd Council of Workmen&apos;s and Soldiers&apos; Delegates.   It must be admitted, however, that the Commission succeeded as little in taking a real grip of the situation as have the successive Governments in Russia. With the process of time power slipped frcim their grasp and very little was done practically in the way of dealing with the economic demands of the moment.   The attempt tc form local Councils of Soldiers&apos; and Workmen&apos;s Delegates also at first met with less success than in European Russia, mainly owing to the national differences hindering co-operation between the local workmen and the Russian soldiers.     Almost immediately the Georgian people began to assert their national claims. An appeal was presented by the Georgian Holy Synod of Tiflis to the Provisional Government, requesting them to annul the union of the Georgian Church with the Russian Orthodox Church, and to recognise the spiritual independence and autocephaly of the Georgian Churoh by allowing it to nominate its own Catholikos, with his seat at Tiflis, in place of the Russian Exarch appointed for Georgia by the Holy Synod.     In answer to this appeal, which
was made early in April, the Provisional Government recognised in principle the right of the Georgians to their spiritual self-determination and hierarchical independence, leaving the other points for later consideration.     It is quite clear, however, that the Georgians intend to press for the complete recognition of ecclesiastical autocephaly on a territorial basis.     On the same day a Conference of the Social-Democratic party adopted a resolution calling on Georgians to demand political-territorial autonomy for themselves at the Constituent Assembly.The Social-Democrat8, through their organ &quot;Ertcba&quot;, however, considered this a policy of &quot;narrow nationalism&quot;, and declared themselves against all spirit of compromise with bourgeois and ecclesiastical Interests.     It is an interesting fact that Social-Democratic leaders like Tseretfll, Tchkheidze and Tchekhengeli found more response among the Russian urban masses than amongst their own people:   the explanation is doubtless to be found in the circumstance that the mass of the Georgian people are primitive peasant agriculturalists and not modern industrialists they are also strongly nationalist as a whole and therefore opposed to the internationalism of the Soviets.     Of all the different nationalities in the Caucasus, the Georgians made the most rapid progress during the first weeks after the Revolution in asserting and developing their nationalist claims;   they also were very active in holding conferences for the reorganisation of their educational and other systems tending to contribute to the development of their national life.On April 23rd the Special Commission for Trans-Caucasia issued a proclamation referring to the unique opportunity given to every nationality to rearrange its cultural and economic life on a national basis, and proposing amongst other things to take
measures for the Introduction of the Zemstvo on broad democratic pr&amp;nciples, to reorganise municipal government in accordance with the new order, and change the system of election of justices of the peace.   Other reforms in connection with the transport service etc. were also envisaged.   But the whole scheme, although at first received with enthusiasm, was soon felt to be insufficiently objective, and the introduction by Tehekhengeli Of a common Soviet for the Soldiers&apos; and Workmen1s Deputies synchronised with an active press campaign in favour of the secialisatien of the land and of State property.   A long drawn out conference of Representatives of the Army, which commenced at Tiflis      May 6th, preved an occasion for much disintegrating and demoralising talk, resolutions being passed in favour of immediate oenfiscation of all lands except those of private individuals, whieh latter were to remain untouched, until the Constituent Assembly&apos;,    Prom this time events tcok a retrcgraue course. Lawlessness and anarchy were reported in increasing measure from all parts of the country, provoked in great part by the shortage of food supplies due to interruption in the transport from European Russia, and direct endeavours, the origin of which proved very difficult to trace, were made to foment feeling and provoke disturbances between the different nationalities.   It proved particularly easy to work upon the mutual fear of Tatar and Armenian, although the early days of the Revolution had been charactorisod by a general desire to begin a new era of mutual forbearance and understanding.    At the Conference of Trans -Caucasian peasants held at Tiflis in July the Georgians showed a tendoncy to desert their fellow political associates and vote on purely national grounds with the Tatars against the Armenians.
There ia little doubt that to-day the Georgian peasant stands for private ownership in land just as he has done during the past generations, and is radically opposed to all schemes for its socialisation.     Demands for land have been forthcoming&quot; from Curia, Murgrelia, Imeretia, Kartalinia and Kakhetia.     He also may be acquitted of any extreme separatist aspirations.     Indeed the Georgian spirit as expressed through its representatives at the Moscow Conference has not been surpassed in its loyalty to the Russian cause.The failure of the Korniloff venture and the literal acceptance by the local Bolsheviks of Kerenskyfs appeal for support against him marked another stage in the progressive lawlessness and anarchy which have latterly reigned in the Caucasus as elsewhere.     At a meeting of the local Soviet on Aug.30-12anTSxecutive Committee was appointed for the express purpose of &quot;fighting the attempt at counter-revolution&quot;.     It decided to assume administration of the Caucasus and on the 31 - 13 arrested the Chief of the Caucasian Staff and many other officers, and further unceremoniously asked the Special Commission for Trans-Caucasiajp to relinquish all their functions and powers to them.     The latter telegraphed to Kerensky and resigned.    On 2 - 15 September, the &quot;Izvestia Sovieta&quot;, the local organ of the Tiflis Soviet, published an extraordinary edict in which it informed the people that the Soviet had already assumed all powers, and was preparing to wage battle against the counter-Revolution.     In answer to a telegram from Kerensky requesting the Committee to dissolve now that the danger was over, a meeting was summoned at which after shedding their Armenian and Georgian members, they declined to obey the order of the Prime Minister, and as the Commissioners have again taken up their duties at his request, the Caucasus is apparently subject to a dual authority.     This situation has also tended to strengthen the attitude of -the nationalist groups.
19.11.17.Latterly, owing to the   increasing demoralisation in the Caucasian Army, whose 200,000 Russians have been stirred up by agents provocateurs and advised to leave the Caucasus and go home &quot;as it is unnecessary to fight for thesfc 1 Asiatics111, the Georgian and Armenian leaders have come to the following decisions with regard to the defence of the Caucasisn frontier.(1)   If the Russian troops retire from the Turkish front, the Georgian and Armenian soldiers must do their utmost to prevent such a retirement and resist the Turkish army.(2)   Special Georgian and Armenian regiments should be selected to defend their countries to the last drop of blood.(3)   An alliance of arms should be concluded between the Georgians and Armenians for the mutual defence of the respective territories.
