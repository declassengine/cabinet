General Headquarters, Home Forces,Horse Guards,London, S.W.14th October., 1917. Sir,I have the honour to forward for the information of the Army Council the attached correspondence which I have received from the General Officer. Commanding-in-Chief the Forces in Ireland.2,     I would suggest that the responsibility now falling upon the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief in connection with matters, which in normal circumstances would be dealt with by the civil authorities,  is sufficient to justify him in raising the whole question of the administration of the Defence of the Realm Regulations in Ireland; and I would submit that his proposals are worthy of serious consideration with a view to placing the matter on a more satisfactory footing.-3.     The present position in Ireland is anomalous.    The country cannot be said to he under Martial Law, for the civil authorities remain primarily responsible for the preservation of law and order, and are not controlled by the military authorities in matters of policy.On the other hand the normal administration of the criminal law has been seriously modified by the suspension by Ro3ral Proclamation of Section 1 of the Defence of the Realm (Amendment) Act 1915.4.     The legal effect of this Proclamation is to empower the CM.A. to try civilians accused of offences  (other than summary offences) against the D.R.R. by Court Martial.   In practice, however, the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief in deciding what cases should be tried&apos; by Court Martial is guided by the instructions of the War Cabinet,  issued through the Chief Secretary for Ireland.. The sentences imposed by the Courts Martial, and confirmed by the General Officer Gommanding-in-Chief are also liable to revision by the Chief Secretary in the exercise of the Crown Is&apos; Prerogative of Mercy.    It follows, therefore, that while the military authorities are ostensibly responsible for the administration of the&apos; Defence of the Realm Regulations they are in effect controlled by the civil power.5.     The difficulties inherent in such an arrangement are gravely increased by the political&apos; conditions under which it has to be worked./Owing to the attitude in this matter of the local Magistrates all cases&quot; of contravention of the Defence of the Realm Regulations which are submitted to the CM.A., must either be sent for trial by Court Martial or remain practically unpunished, yet it is plainly undesirable that recourse should be had to Courts Martial for the trial of trivial offences.    Such a course at once impairs the prestige of these Courts, and &apos; intensifies the ill-feeling of the civil -population to the military authorities.   The rules of procedure,&apos; which govern Courts Martial, particularly in the matter of bail, are also quite unsuited for dealing with minor cases.On the other, hand, if minor offences go unpunished, it becomes increasingly difficult to enforce the law in&quot;serious cases.. 0.XuO^-(I)
6.     In cases where trial by Court Martial is appropriate the military authorities have to accept the responsibility for the trial of the offenders, and for the setting up of a standard of punishment, but the sentences imposed are liable to be subsequently modified by the civil power on political grounds.   The inevitable result of such revision is to create the impression that the civil and military authorities are following divergent policies, and to throw upon the military authorities all the odium of a military dictatorship, where they do not enjoy the power.7.      In view of these circumstances I beg to endorse the suggestion of the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief that some other tribunal should be found to dispose of all minor cases arising under the Defence of the Realm Regulations, and that trial by Court Martial should be reserved foM serious cases, which have a direct bearing upon the military situation.    I would respectfully submit that if such a plan is adopted the.sentences of Courts Martial, after cpnfirmation, should not be reduced without the concurrence of the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief,8.     I would suggest that effect could be given to this proposal by an amendment to the Defence of the Realm Regulations enabling the Competent Military Authority, whenever a Proclamation&quot;suspending Section 1 of the Defence of the Realm (Amendment) Act 1915 i3 in force, to send cases under the Regulations for trial by a Resident Magistrate sitting alone.   Such a procedure would not amount to so great a modification of the normal administration of the law as is entailed in the trial of minor cases by military courts.I have the honour to be, Sir,Your obedient Servant,(Sgd,)   F.

Headquarters,Irish Command,Parkgate, &quot;Dublin-^6th October, 1917.Sir,I have the honour to forward to you herewith a copy of a letter which I have addressed to the Chief,Secretary.The instructions referred to in the first paragraph of this letter were those of the War Cabinet with regard to the general policy to be pursued in the administration of the Defence of the Realm Act in this country,I enclose a second copy in case you may think fit to forward it to the Chief of the Imperial General Staff,I have the honour to be, Sir,Your obedient Servant,(Sgd.)

r Heauquart er s,:- Irish Command.)1     (A*2,) Parkgate, Dublin,5th October, 1017.Sir,The state of affairs in this country lias lately undergone a change which renders it, in my opinion, necessary to report to you on matters which affect the Military situation and also the administration of the Defence of the Realm Act and Regulations. -The instructions contained in your memorandum, lTo-.l?115 cf fee 14th July last have been carefully followed, subject, however, to the limitations which have become necessary owing to political expediency-.    This aspect of the question is one on which the Military Authorities must act on the directions of the Civil Executive,2,     The death and funeral of Ashe have resulted in an outburst Of popular sympathy, of which the utmost use has been made by the Sinn Fein leaders, in all parts of the country,Rebel uniforms have been worn by man;/ persons in public arms have been openly carried in processions,, and there is every indication of careful organization of the disloyal and dangerous elements.       These facts furnish evidence cf the condition of the country and are confirmed by the reports of my Intelligence Officers in tho Districts, particularly in the Southern District which is reported to be in a most unsatisfactory stateThese recent breaches of the Regulations have been tacitly permitted, and open defience of the law is likely to continue unless firm measures are again instituted which are,  in my opinion, particularly necessary in cases of organised drilling, carrying arms, the wearing of uniforms of a military character, and speeches containing direct incitement to immediate violence-.    It is impossible to forecast the results which may accrue from the amelioration of the treatment of offenders while in prison, but it is not unreasonable to assume that further attempts may be made to force the hands of the Government, and that such attempts may even -take the form of demanding release.       It is to be remembered that one of the aims and objects cf the Sinn Fein movement is to embarrass the Government to the greatest extent possible.3.     The dangers which may arise from the military point of view appear to me to be as follows:-(l)   An organised passive resistance against government.This course of action has been constantly hinted at by Do Valera and other leaders of the. Sinn Fein movement in the course of their speeches.   The organization of this Party is becoming more perfect, ..and their followers are exhibiting discipline te a remarkable degree which is perhaps the most dangerous sign cf the times.   As instances of this, I v-rould refer to the recent bye-elections, where disturbances were prevented by the action of the Sinn. Peiners themselves, and also to the funeral procession of Thomas Ashe which was attended by a vast and highly organized procession of 10 to l-p thousand people entirely outside the control of the Police. A passive resistance movement is,  in my opinion, the greatest danger we have to face,    It might include a Railway strike which would most seriously affect the military situation as regards the movement of troops and the carriage of munitions.
(2)   Sporadic outrages on Munition Works&quot;j Govern/lent stores and buildings.-Sabotage is always a possibility in Ireland, and the likelihood of such occurent.es as these is only- increased in the light of recent event s-..Armed Guards are provided on vulnerable points, but these neasures cannot be regarded as&quot; affording complete protection.(3.)   Armed rebellion.This danger is, I consider, unlikely to occur unless an enemy landing is effected,    nevertheless it is a possibility,  should a collision occur with the ar: :cd forces of the Crown.    I am satisfied that the preparation which have been made to deal with any armed rising are adequate for the purpose.(4)    I now. desire to refer to the administration of the Defence t*f the Realm Act &amp; Regulations.Under the Government instructions referred to in paragraph 1 cf this letter, 29 persons have been tried by Court hartial for offences, against the drilling Order, and 5 persons for making . speeches, inciting to violence,   These trials have apparently had a gcod effect in most parts of the country in acting as a deterrent, but.it is an undoubted fact that they tend to embitter the country and render more probable the dangers to which&apos; reference has already been made.     .This is&apos; in a measure due to reports in the newspapers read by this class of person, which,  in endeavouring to provide acceptable natter,  invariably put forward distorted versions of incidents which occur - The true facts and the Government views are rarely brought to. their notice.If the general practice in future is .to give First Division &amp;i similar treatment to persons sentenced to imprisonment , by Court-Martial, these Courts may lose much of their effect and will .become despised as well as hated.    It would, therefore, appear desirable to limit Courts-IIartial as .far as possible to offences for which amelioration of treatment is inapplicable if other measures can be adopted for dealing with other cases.5. ..  The difficulties of the situation are accentuated by the fact that Courts-Martial are,  in nearly every part of Ireland,  the only possible Courts for the trial of.contraventions of the Defence of the. Realm Regulations,&apos;while many ,ef these offences are of a minor character, often the result ef mere br&amp;gadoccio, and therefore, unsuitable for trial.by this method. j It is.to be regretted that there is no other&apos;tribunal at which an&quot;impartial hearing cf such offences can be.obtained.    It may here by notad that Courts--Martial cannot.hold to.bail, !a fact which furnishes additional argument  &apos; against the trial by them&apos; of minor o:ffences. &apos;., . 6.     Difficulty has also lately arisen in trials for violent speeches.    The- police witnesses have only been able to /produce me .tal -notes which have been committed to writing after the -conclusion of the meetings.   This has proved unsatisfactory as regards proof..7.      Mo proceedings have yet been taken against the leaders of -the Sinn Fein .movement. though many of the rank and file have been tried for various offences&apos;, principally for.drilling.  &quot;This   : has caused irritation&quot;, &quot;in&quot; the country and .has given&quot;additional&apos; -influence-
influence to the leaders, who consider themselves immune from hiudra ce in their activities.   There appears to he little prospect of improvement in the situation while this feeling continues, and I therefore desire to &quot;bring again to your notice for consideration the necessity for some action being taken against Messrs De Valera, L.Ginnell, Darrel Figgis, John Milroy, Arthur Griffith, Madame Markievioz and other prominent extremists.   Such action need not necessarily lead to trial or imprisonment, but might take the form, of deportation or internment, -8.     The possession of a large number of arms by the Ulster Volunteers, is a source of irritation to the &quot;fictional Volunteers whose arms were lately seized.   The pretext of seizing these arms does not exist in the case of. Ulster as it is unlikely that they will get into undesirable hands, though a coup de main by the Sinn Fein Party for the seizure of some of them is not impossible,.It is also recognised that the risk of the stoppage of work in the Munition Factories in the Forth prevents the taking of these arms by force,   The only solution appears to be an arrangement by which they would be voluntarily surrendered to the Military Authorities fcr safe custody,9.     In conclusion I beg to append for your information a table showing the numbers of cases in which persons have been imprisoned under sentence by Courts-Martial, during two periods,,A, 12 months from 14th July 1916 - 14th July 1017.B. 2i months from 14th July 1917 - to 1st October 1917,In this connection I desire to state that since the release of the Rebel prisoners on the 16th June 1917 I myself, and the Competent Military Authorities acting under me, have.determined to take no proceedings under the Defence of the Realm Regulations in laany cases which would unquestionably have been tried by Court-I^rtial a year ago, .I htive the honour to be.Sir,Your obedient Servant,(Sgd,.)

&quot;  15115,, ;Irish Office,Old Queen Street,, S.W.&apos;, Uth July, 1,917,Under Secretary.The War. Cabinet discussed to-day various questions of Irish Administration connected- with memoranda submitted by me, and the report you made me on Thursday and yesterday as to the conference convened by the Lord Lieutenant and the incidents of the last few days.Action in the undermentioned particulars will have the sanction and- support in all respects of His Majesty*8 Government ;-\(a) Incitements to acts of violence, and in particular, to attacks upon Police, should be made the subject of prosecution.(b) The; Police should defend themselves with vigour, as well as moderation, in case of attacks upon them when they are in force which admits of defence:, and should prosecute (either before Resident magistrate, or Courts Martial, as may be decided in oases as they arise) persons who assemble and offer such attack.(The assurance of... support recently given personally to Inspector-General and Chief Commissioner must be borne in mind b them)^(c) Prilling, marching in. military order,- marching with weapons, and carrying arms in a public place y/ithout licence, should be vigorously prevented - ringleaders being always prosecuted.The making of arrangements for such drilling and marching should.also be the subject of prosecution.(d) . Isolated acts of wearing-the &quot;rebel;&quot; uniform are not regardedin the same light as. the wearing of.uniform in connection with .drilling or marching.   The latter offence.is, however, aggravate by this.; incident where it occurs.(e). . Meetings in open spaces where they eause danger as for example -Publin -streets, should be-provided against by prohibition in any area where this appears necessary, and persons offending against.the prohibition could be dealt with for that offence   .. whatever the character of the oratory at the meeting.(f) ,A prohibition against processions in any area ^without leave of&quot;a- specified authority, would, appear to be. a judicious step.(g) . Admittance to meetings should only be -.sought under compulsory --. powers-when there is occasion upon.the-known facts,(h):. Discretion should be., exercised and as consistent a course kept a possible in-deciding whether the proper tribunal for Defence Of the Realm Regulation offences, and kindred offences, is a Court of -Resident. Magistrates or a Court Martial.The-latter tribunal cannot hold to bail,(j)- The powers of the-General Officer Commanding-in^Chief,or-:the :  seizure of presses of.printers issuing seditious matter, should be -.exarcised in all clear cases of. seditious publication.
(k)   Except speeth.es which incite to immediate violence or immediate illegal acts, speeches should not generally Toe the subject of prosecution.They car- he rendered comparatively harmless by prevention or punishment of the various overt acts intended to result from them, and speakers who break the other Regulations can be punished for the police offence.You will observe, as the guiding principle of the above decisions, a distinction between opinion uttered in speech and the overt acts generally to which mischievous opinions and evil advice are intended to lead.    These latter include aeditious publications. And in any case where the premises of (e.g.) a Sinn Pein Club or other Society are found to be used for the organization of overt acts of disorder or for the carrying on of illegal practices such as drilling, the power of closing such premises, which is contained in the Defence of the Realm Regulations,&apos; can be used.Consideration was given to the question of a &quot;Warning&quot; before prosecutions, take place.   There are advantages and disadvantages, and unless some incident in Parliament gives occasion for a statement, the Executive must, I tnink, take it that a vigorous presecution in a conspicuous case of misconduct, v/ith a statement by the prosecuting Counsel or   Solicitor, distinctly made, by way of warning that the Government will not tolerate the class of acts in question, will make it apparent that there is no policy of immunity for lawbreakers,The above conclusions leave it open evidently for consider-ation when cases arise whether a particular speech or incentive should &quot;be exceptionally dealt with, anu they do not involve any leniency in respect of persons who make mischievous speeches if such persons are also found engaged in any of the overt acts of disorder which I have mentioned.General Offioer Commanding;   Attorney General; Inspector General, and Chief Commissioner should be informed of the purnort of this minute.(Sgd.)   H.E.D.14.7.17.
Irish Office,Old Queen Street,,9th November, 1917.hy dear Secretary of State,On October 24th you wrote sae with reg rd to some suggestions which had originated in Ireland in respect to the relations, of the Irish Com-land with the business of the suppression of revolutionary action and the process of trial by court-martial to which we have been driven in default of ;effective civil tribunals in order that offenders against Defence of the Realm Regulations as to drilling and like conduct might be legally de It /with.Since I received your letter I have given much time and trouble to various endeavours for relieving the Military Authorities of some of the burden imposed upon them by constant, reference to courts-martial of cases arising out of the Sinn Fein movement.    I have discussed the matter wit-in the last few days with Lieutenant General Sir Bryan h.ahon and hope to see my way to provide means by which all the cases which are not of a very grave character may be dealt with by civil tribunals.There is great difficulty in the adoption of Sir Bryan hahonhs suggestion for the reference of the cases in question to magisterial courts.    The outstanding obstacle is that in the majority of cases local magistrates who might desire to do their duty, in repressing the seditious movement would yiP.Td.ly dare to give proper effect to their own wishes,&apos; and that in a wide range of cases the present occupants of the local magisterial bench have no very great desire to repress any popular political movement whether such movement be witnin or without the law.As I have said, however,  I hope to see my way in co-operation with Sir Bryan Mali on to relieve the Military Authorities of the extremely burdensome and uncongenial duties which the difficulties of the situation have caused to be is ^osed upon them, and I hope he will shortly be able to report to you the success of my efforts in this behalf.Believe hie,Yours truly, &apos;  - (Sgd.)   H,E.Duke.gilt HonourableThe Marl of Derby, K.G., G.C.V.O., G.B.,    -Secretary of State for Y/ar, War Office,Whitehall, S.L. 1.
