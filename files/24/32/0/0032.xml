BOARD OF&apos;AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES. ,75; avoid May, address all communications to :- FOOD   PRODUCTION   DEPARTMENT,JJJEesOjRECTOR General.72, Victoria Street,London, S.W. (1) 14th November-, 2917 c1reSir,I beg to submit the following Report on the work of the Foad production Department for the week ended 13th November^. 1917:-The leather.The weather last week, taking the country as a whole, was unfavourable for farm work.     In Lancashire and Cheshire, for example, rain fell on six days out of the seven, and in V/ales as a whole, there was very little possibility during the week of doing anything on the land;   on the other hand, the report from Northumberland and Durham states that the weather was &quot;favourable&quot;, being fairly dry though cold with only one day&apos;s wet.In the South, conditions have been vpry unsettled, rain falling at frequent intervals in Hants, Dorset, and the Isle of Wight. In the Yiost Country, with a few exceptions, the weather has continued extremely bad.The extension wf the arable area in England and Wales continues to be very seriously hampered by abnormal weather conditions.     The lateness of the harvest and the unusually large amount of work which had to be done on the stubbles, have prevented farmers, with few exceptions, from devoting their limited resources during the last two months to ploughing additional grassland.     Unless, therefore, the weather conditions improve materially between now and Christmas, the area of grassland broken up before the end of this year will be considerably less than at one time was anticipated.
LOCAL ORGANISATION DIVISION. Agricultural Executive Ccremittees. Cumberland - The Executive Ccircuittee are arranging to relinquish possession of the Hesket and Lamonby Hall Farms in favour of approved tenants.     The Committee have been in possession of these farms since the early spring, and have brought them back into cultivation from a state of neglect.Cumberland being a county in which cattle are bred upon a considerable scale, the Committee are making arrange-ments for the agistment of breeding cattle for bena fide farmers who are breaking up grass land under their directions, Gloucestershire - The Committee have been authorised to take possession of a neglected farm of 142 acres near Chipping Campden occupied by the owner;    it is hoped, however,  that he may be induced to let the farm to an approved tenant for a long term,  and that the Committee may not have to take possession. Hampshire - The owner of the Highcliffe Golf Course has agreed &apos;.:Jith the Committee that the course shall be grazed with dairy cows.Lancashire - The Committee have been authorised to take possession of a neglected and unstocked farm of 67 acres in the Chorley district.Suffolk, West - A farm of 30 acres at Woolpit is stated to have been kept in a disgracefully neglected state by the owner-occupier:   and the Csmmittee have been authorised to take possession of the farm.Warwickshire - The Executive Committee have been authorised to take possession of a farm of 216 acres on the Packington Estate and to farm it themselves or let it to another tenant.     Th..y have also been advised to serve cultivation orders upon the tenants of certain other farms on the estate, and to put the
Rabbits Order and Drainage Order into execution.     The manege-ment of this estate and the frequent changes of tenant have .igiven rise to various acute problems in connection with Its cultivation, which it has not been found possible to settle in any other way than that above mentioned, in spite of endeavours to obtain an amicable arrangement with the ewner. Damage by Hailstorms - An area of 50,000 acres about Cirencester has been found in the past to be peculiarly liable to hailstorms, and, as a result of a severe storm in 1915, tho Companies doing hailstorm insurance business had refused to accept proposals from farmers in this area.     The Gloucester-shire Agricultural Executive Committee considered that if farmers could be enabled tn insure, this would tend to increase the acreage of corn in the district.     As a result of a conference held in this Department, the Royal, Alliance, and Yorkshire Offices have undertaken to consider each proposal for insurance on its merits, and not to decline them merely because the land is situate in this area.     The Farmers&apos; Firs et?. Office, York, have also signified their willingness to insure.Damage by Came - Action under the Rabbits Order is reported from Buckinghamshire.. Durham and Surrey, and under the Pheasants Order from Buckinghamshire. Surrey and Cornwall. Determination of Tenancies - During the week 7 Orders have been made authorising landlords to determine tenancies on account of bad farming in respect of 618 acres, and 9 Orders have been made by the Board determining the tenancies of 667 acres.
HORTICULTURAL DIVISION. Fruit and other Agricultural Baskets.   As a result of reports received and enquiries made by the Department, it is evident that there is a serious shortage of fruit and other agricultural baskets.The shortage is due, in the first place to the reduction in the number of imported baskets, and in the second place to a reduction in the rate of manufacture of home-made baskets.   The latter is to be attributed to:-   (1) the calling up of skilled basket-makers, and (2) the migration of basket makers to &quot;starred&quot; trades and more remunerative occupations.It is estimated that no less than 2,000,000 new baskets will be required for the carriage of fruit and vegetables next year, and it is probable, moreover, that the requirements will be very considerably in excess of this number.    In this connection it is to be observed that, in order to ensure the rapid transport of perishable goods, a large surplus of baskets is required, for, as the complaints from salesmen shew, very great delay is experienced in the return of empties; hence a basket is put out of action for a long spell during the period when it is most required.With a view to ascertaining the resources of the trade, conferences were held with masters and men engaged in basket-making.   The basket-makers expressed themselves confident of being able to manufacture sufficient baskets if the labour which they had lost could be restored.    Inasmuch, however, as this involved the calling back of men from the Army and the transference of men from munitions and- other important factories, it is evident that the shortage cannot be made up in this way.The basket-makers are considering a suggestion made by the Department that skilled labour might be supplemented by dilution, and it is believed that they will be prepared, on the grounds of national urgency, to accept the principle of dilution
if it is accompanied by the recall of a certain number of men to act as Instructors of unskilled labour.    It was, however, urged with apparent earnestness that basket-making is a highly skilled industry and that unskilled labour is not likely to produce sufficient baskets to meet the needs of the coming year.With a view to the possible supplementing of the trade output, negotiations have been entered into with the Belgian Refugees Committee, and, as a result of the negotiations, it is believed that an existing factory manned by Belgians could be extended and a second factory established.    It is to be noted, however, that salesmen do not esteem highly Belgian baskets.   The Department are also endeavouring to arrange for the employment of interned Austrians and other aliens, and also prisoners of war, some of whom are skilled basket-makers, as it is satisfied that all possible sources of labour will have to be drawn upon if a sufficient number of baskets is to be forthcoming next year.Enquiries have been made into the present condition of osier beds whence is derived the material for baskets, and it appears . as a result of these enquiries, that the cultivation of osiers is generally in a seriously neglected state, and it will be necessary, if supplies of raw material are to be forthcoming, to secure to the cultivators the labour which they have already at their disposal, and to supply them with additional labour.The enquiries are being continued and it is hoped that it may be possible to suggest in detail means for securing the necessary supply both of raw material and of baskets, but even if all the available sources are used, it will apparently be necessary to approach the Railway Executive Committee with the object of securing during the coming year an improvement in the system of returned empties.Home Canners.   Since last Report, 6 canners and 6,260 two and three pound cans have been sold.
In addition to the small canning stations at Bridgwater and Cheltenham, a third station.is now in operation at Worcester.Canning demonstrations have been held at Gloucester two days, and at Newport, Isle of Wight, two days.Potato Bread.    Conferences have been held with the Bakers Allied Trades Association with the object of encouraging the use of potatoes in bread, and the Association is prepared to assist by supplying machinery for the manufacture of potato flour and farina and also by encouraging bakers to use cooked and mashed potatoes in bread.It has been ascertained that peeling machines suitable for use in small bakeries can be produced at the rate of 300 per week, and that plant for dealing with the potatoes can also be supplied to large bakeries at a similar rate.Commercial Alcohol.   A small trial in the manufacture of commercial alcohol from potatoes has been carried out at Messrs. Haig&apos;s at Hammersmith, and has given excellent results.    A trial on a more extended scale is about to be carried out by the same firm at Greenock.Pulping.    Pulping of apples is still being carried on at the pulping stations except at Marden and Sittingbourne.TECHNICAL DIVIolO^. Treatment of Seeds.   Experiments have been instituted (1) to test the effect of treatment of seeds with ammonium nitrate, which an Italian investigator alleges to be the most economical method of supplying nitrogen to crops;    (2) to test the effect of the Wolfryn electro-chemical treatment of seeds, whereby the crop is said to be considerably increased.The Technical Committee has received a preliminary report on a series of experiments conducted at Cambridge into tho germination of cereals treated with various proprietary dressings used as a protection against birds, &amp;c, namely Corvusine, Little&apos;s Dressing, and Seedolin.    The experiments so far have been
confined to the laboratory, and definite conclusions will not bo put forward until the results of field experiments, which are now being arranged, are available.   The preliminary results indicate, however, that the number of plants obtained from seeds treated with Seedolin and Little&apos;s Dressing may quite possibly be reduced by 25??, and it will be necessary to interfere with their sale if the field experiments confirm the laboratory tests,   Corvusine seems to be quite inocuous as regards germination and growth, but it is not so effective as the other dressings in keeping off birds. Seed Testing Station.   The official opening of the new Government Seed Testing Station took place to-day, 14th November, at the offices of the Food Production Department in the presence of a company of 60 to 70 persons comprising Members of Parliament Agriculturists, and representatives of tho seed trade and of the press. The Station, which has been equipped at a cost of less than  500, consists of a laboratory and three other rooms in 70 Victoria Street. Its establishment will enable farmers in England and 7ifales to avail themselves of facilities for seed testing under Government auspices which their colleagues in both Scotland and Ireland have enjoyed for some years.The Station is now prepared to accept samples from farmers and the trade. Tho fee charged to farmers will be 3d per sample, and to merchants 2/6 a sample for a full report. A Circular to Seedsmen, setting forth the regulations under which samples will be tested at the Station, has been sent to press and a leaflet for farmers, explaining the Testing of Seeds Order, and giving particulars as regards the facilities offered for testing by the Station, has also been prepared and will be issued without delay.Economy in the use of Seed Grain. As a result of the unfavourable harvest weather a good deal of damaged corn is being sown and there are indications that farmers are wasting grain by sowing much too freely in order to compensate for inferior germination. A leaflet has been prepared urging farmers to have their seed tested and pointing out the waste of food and danger of loss to themselves, which the practice of sowing untested seed of doubtful quality involves.
LABOUR DIVISION.Soldier Labour.-The returns received show that during the week a further 1,500 men arrived at the Distribution Centres, making a total to date of 13,417 so-called &quot;skilled&quot; and 12,859 unskilled, in all 26,276 men out of the 43,000 to be made available for the 1918 Programme.     Of these men 11,836 skilled and 10,857 unskilled are out with farmers.     The remainder are either undergoing training or on the staff of the Distribution Centres.The number of men sent for training as tractor drivers and ploughmen during the week was 104, making a total to date of 1,311.      In addition, 187 men have been supplied for work with steam ploughing or threshing tackle.In view of the difficulty that is being experienced in obtaining from the Military Authorities a sufficient number of skilled ploughmen, Committees are being urged to Increase their output of such men at the Schools and also to get more men placed with farmers for training. Horses - Orders for the issue of 67 horses were sent out during the week, making a total of 3,419 horses to date. Prisoners of Vi&apos;ar -   Schemes for the formation of four additional agricultural prisoner camps were sent to the War Office during the week, making a total of 11 new camps now under consideration by the War Office.     In addition, extra men are reoauired at eight of the existing camps.     The total number of additional men ?rtio will be employed when these new schemes are put into operation is 1,140.     As a number of canvas camps have had to be closed down for the winter months the total number of prisoners at present employed in agriculture is only 5,063, as compared with 5,177 in the middle of October.
Womenfs Branch.The interesting event of the week has been the inclusion in the Lord Mayor&apos;s Show of 100 members cf the women&apos;s Land Army.     The contingent was led by Group Leaders and included a farm cart, of which the horses were led by women.     Those marching in the Procession were drawn from nine of the home counties under the charge, in each case, of the Organising Secretary.The returns this week of the women&apos;s Land Army show an increase over last week of 190 women, and are as follows:-In Training Centres............ 280On Farm work.................... 5,901i Waiting for references to beplaced in Training Centres ... 26Waiting for employment in Depots. 34Waiting in their own homes ...... 133Employed by the Forage Department 362 Employed by the Timber Supply .Department.......... 126Total 6,862A new return has been received 7/hich shoves that, exclusive of the Land Army, there were in October 178.556 part-time and 79,785 whole-time women land workers in England and Wales, making a total of 258,341.     The figures show a slight increase on those received by similar methods last July.Arrangements have been made during the past week for an Advanced Course to be held at the County Council Farm, Garforth, in the West Riding of Yorkshire.     This Course, which is to be confined entirely to Land Army women, is to be given to six selected women from the North and West Ridings.     The Course will consist of further
training in milking, management of stock and some indoor dairy work.     A number of lectures will be given explaining the various operations, and it is hoped that the women after their training may be able to take more responsible posts on dairy farms.ploughing has been held in Cheshire this week.     The Test was arranged by the Agricultural Executive Committee for soldiers who have been trained under the Tractor Representative, and women from the Land Army attended and took part.     The Tractor Representative in this county has decided to employ on Government tractors five or six women who have just finished their training.visited this week, and new ones have been started as a result of meetings by Institute organisers.     At Coats, a small village in Gloucestershire containing less than 40 houses inclusive of out-lying farms and cottages, 35 people were present at the monthly Institute meeting. The members of this Institute have an allotment which they work co-operatively, and it is an example of the success that Women1s Institutes achieve even In the smallest villages.regards the provision of tractors purchased or ordered by the Department:-An Efficiency Test both in horse and motorSeveral existing is; omen&apos;s Institutes have beenMECHANICAL CULTIVATION DIVISION.The following statement shows the position asConsigned to Agricultural Executive Committees up to and including 3rd November ..............1,672Additional tractors consigned during the week........................6On offer to counties52Consigned to Scotland   106tfIreland701761,906
SUPPLIES DIVISION. Supplies Sub-Committee s.    The lists of Approved Agents, which are now completed, show that the number of Agents appointed is 818, and the total of Sulphate of Ammonia which they have undertaken to store is 18,466 tons.Sjalphate of i Ammonia.   The deliveries of sulphate of ammonia during October amounted to 13,500 tons as against 22,600 tons the preceding month.   This decrease was no doubt due to the higher price charged for delivery in the autumn quarter.    The quantity .sold for forward delivery now amounts to 70,000 tons.Superphosphate.   The quantity of Phosphate Rock imported into the United Kingdom in the 5 months June - October, has been 149,000 tons, while 43,000 tons are at present on passage.    It is expected that the arrivals in November and December will amount to 50,000 tons in each month.    If this proves to be the case, the arrivals in the 7 months of the present season will amount to about 250,000 tons as against the 350,000 tons which was the amount for which the Cabinet asked the Shipping Controller to arrange. Basic Slag.   The production and deliveries have been well main-tained during the past four weeks, the production being 40,263 tons and the deliveries 42,292 tons.    The Railway Executive has agreed to issue a notice instructing Railway Companies to give preference to Basic Slag.An enquiry has been made with a view to seeing the extent to which makers have sold forv/ard.    The information received confirms the statement already made that the whole of the prospective output has been sold for delivery as available up to 31st May next.Nitrate of Soda.   Owing to the great need for Nitrate of Soda for munition purposes, the Ministry of Munitions propose to require farmers to obtain a licence to purchase this fertiliser, and arc-not prepared to accept the suggestion made by this Department that the sale should be permitted freely for use as a manure.
Sulphate of Copper.   Negotiations are no?/ proceeding with makers of Sulphate of Copper with a view to fixing prices for next season. Potash.   A small cargo of Sulphate of Potash, which was put into the Prize Court at Malta, is being brought to this country and is being offered for sale to Approved Agents. Stable Manure.   An offer has been received from the Surrey Agricultural Executive Committee to arrange for the disposal of manure from the Eelmoor dump, provided it is barged to selected centres on the Basingstoke Canal.   The 7/ar Office is being pressed for the manure to be moved as proposed with a view to itsbeing collected by farmers for use this season.Enquiry has also been made in regard to a dump at Shirehampton, near Avonmouth;   this dump only contains now about 2,400 tons, and it is being moved at the rate of about 80 tons per day.   100 men, 30 horses and a motor lorry are wholly employed on the work, the charge made being 1/- per ton on rail, or l/- per mile when delivered by lorry holding 3 tons.   The arrangement at this place seems quite satisfactory, and the dump should be cleared by the end of the year.A complaint by the Glamorgan Agricultural Executive Committee as to the wastage of manure from Collieries has been thoroughly investigated and found to be without foundation.   The manure is used largely on farms belonging to the Collieries, and is also sent away by rail, while in many cases allotment holders are supplied.   The complaint seems due to difficulties experienced by allotment holders in getting manure, and where possible the Department will press the owners to meet the needs of allotments. Feeding Stuffs.   The Ministry of Food has now established Provincial Committees to deal with the distribution of feeding stuffs in local areas.   These Committees were in the first instance composed exclusively of traders, but in response to representations by this Department, the Ministry have agreed that the Committee should include an equal number of farmers, in order that- 12 -
agricultural interests may be fully represented. The Agricultural Executive Committees will be invited by the Department to nominate representatives to serve on these Committees.The Ministry have under consideration an amended Order of the Feeding Stuffs Maximum Prices Order. Various suggestions have already been submitted to the Ministry.Seed Wheat.   Arrangements are being made for the shipment of the first 300 tons of wheat to France from an East coast port.    T/hilc orders from farmers are smaller than they were, a steady but ver;; limited demand continues.   The period for receiving orders has been extended to the 30th instant, in order to meet, as far as possible, the cases where unfavourable weather conditions delayed sowing.Numerous complaints are being received as to the delay of consignments of wheat dispatched to farmers and there is evidently considerable difficulty in securing prompt delivery in the case of small consignments.Seed Control.   The Testing of Seeds Order has been signed by tho Food Controller, and will be issued on the 14th instant.   This will afford the Trade adequate notice before the Order becomes operative on the 1st January.Seed Potatoes.    It is proposed that the Board should issue a general licence for the sale, in England and Wales, of the Varieties affected by the Immune Varieties Order.   The general licence will empower the seller to dispose of such portion of his potatoes as will rest on a 1^   riddle.    The sale of &quot;seed&apos; of these varieties will be possible only under licence from the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries. .   It is not proposed to issue licences for this purpose until the Department are satisfied that the requirements of growers in areas infected with Wart Disease
are met.   Under the Immune Varieties Order, licences have been issued for about 19,000 tons of potatoes.Steps are being taken to secure the necessary supplies of immune and other varieties in Scotland and Ireland.I am,Sir,Your obedient Servant,Director-General.The Rt. Hon. Rowland E. Prothero, M.P.President of the Board of Agricultureand Fisheries.
