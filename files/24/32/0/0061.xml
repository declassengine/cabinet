0A   610TREATMENT^3&apos;   Treatment in Military Hospitals,   Military Hospitals are experiencing considerable pressure on their accommodation owing to the increased numbers of serving soldiers for whom accommodation has to be found in consequence of the continuance of military operations beyond the usual period for this season of the year.   The War Office have accordingly approaohed the Minister with a view to curtailing admissions of discharged men to Military Hospitals for in-patient treatment.   While this restriction on the use of Military Hospitals will, it is feared, make it difficult for Local Committees to obtain the necessary treatment, in some cases, the needs of the wounded soldier are necessarily paramount, and, for the time being at any rate, the Minister of Pensions felt that he had no alternative but to instruct Local Committees to curtail their demands upon Military Hospitals. In these circumstances an Instruction, of which a copy is given in Appendix VII has been issued to Local Committees. 9.   Continued treatment of Seamen and Marines.   Arrangements have now been made with the Admiralty for Naval Hospitals and by Surgern-agents of the Admiralty, who are responsible for invaliding seamen and marines from the service, to supply Local Committees with a form similar to Army Frjrm Y.\3555, indicating the further treatment a man may need after discharge.10. Medical Referees.    The Committee of Selection on the appointment of Medical Referees held two further meetings during the week and agreed on recommendations tc the Minister for the appointment of some sixty Medical Practitioners in the counties of Lincoln, Nottingham, Derby, Rutland, Cheshire and Lancashire-11.   ^^r^^^^lsj^S^l^-.J^.sAjJiVi1 0-na 1 Trcatment.   The J^Jnt Committee held their twenty-ninth meeting on the 15th instant.   The report of their prooedings in Appendix VIII deals mainly with Orthopaedic treatment in a number of areas.
12.   convalescent Homes.    Representations continue to be receiveo. as to the necessity for increased provision for convalescent treatment and the Ministry are in constant correspondence with their Representatives as to the further provision to be made.   During the past week, arrangements have been made for two further Convalescent Homes to be opened.   The first of these is at Yudal Torre, Yelverton, in Devon.   The house which is capablo of accommodating over thirty patients, has been offered to the Ministry and the rent of the property, about  2op a year, has been -generously provided by local voluntary effort.   It is proposed that the Institution shall be managed by a Sub-Committee of the Joint Disablement Committee for the South Western District.   The use of the second Convalescent Home ha3 been secured at Pensarn, Abergele, North Wales,which is at present the property of the Town Council of Walsall.   Patients will be received here at the ratesallowed by the Instructions for Treatment and Training.In this connection the Joint Institutional Committee for Scotland, considered the question of Convalescent Homes generally at their meeting on the 10th instant   and the Scottish Branch of the Red Cross Society will, it is anticipated, take active steps towards meetingthe needs for this form of treatment in Scotland. 13.   Orthopaedic Treatment.   As a result of the enquiry addressed to representatives of the Ministry and Local Committees with regard to the need for further institutions for orthopaedic treatment, reports have now been received showing that there is urgent need for such treatment in many districts, more especially in view of the pressure on the accommodation in Military Hospitals which is referred to in paragraph 8,    It has been decided.therefore to proceed at once with the provision of the necessary Institutions in certain districts, and as a start it is proposed to provide Orthopaedic Sub-Centres inExeter
Exeter (with possibly another Sub-Centro for the South Western District).91 QLiverpool and Manchester. Stockton.In addition it ha^ already been arranged to provide a Sub-Centre at Wrexham.   In each of these areas it will be possible to secure supervision of the work iflrom a neighbour-ing/Orthopaedic Centre.   Wherever possible it is proposed to use either two or more wards or rooms in an existing General Hospital or to provide tho necessary accommodation in premises adjoining a General Hospital in order to secure the neoessary surgical attendance by arrangement with the Hospital.   It is realised that difficulty will occur in securing the necessary practitioners with surgicalexperience, but it is hoped to arrange this either by the temporary loan of surgeons from a neighbouring Orthopaedic Military Centre or by arranging for a short period of training to be given to one of the surgeons at the General Hospital in the Military Centre.It will be remembered that in Scotland provision has been, or is being, made for four Orthopedic Sub-Centres. One of these at Aberdeen was opened by the Parliamentary Secretary, Sir Arthur Boscawen, on the 12th instant.    In this case the necessary accommodation has been provided in premises in the town not attached to a General Hospital, but the necessary supervision is provided from the Old Mill Hospital which is a few miles out of the City.   Tho secondSub-Centre will be opened in Glasgow at tho beginning of December *Neurasthenia.   Reference has been made in previous reports to a scheme for the treatment of loss serious cases of Neurasthenia by means of boarding out in homes in the country where the men oan be given light work for a period of three months or so.   The scheme, which was put for&apos;ward by tho London War Pensions Committee, is now in working order and twelve patients had been sent to homes, by Wednesday the14th instant.
14th instant.   For the purposes of this scheme, careful instructions are given to the householder as to the way in which men should he dealt with.   A statement of the terms under which the treatment is given and of the instructions to the householder are contained in Appendix IX.The attention of the Minister of Pensions has been drawn to the fact that in some instances men suffering from neurasthenia have been admitted to Workhouse Infirmaries and have from there been drafted to Lunatic Asylums.   In accordance vvith the advice of the President of the Special Medical Board (Sir John Collie) the Local Government Board was approached as to the advisability of circularising Boards of Guardians with a view to greater care being exercised in dealing with these cases so as to prevent their being certified as insane.until all other methods of dealing with them have been exhausted.    The Local Government Board have issued a circular accordingly, of which a copy is givenin Appendix X.15.   General Schemes of treatment etc.     Appendix XI contains a report of the general schemes of treatment submitted and sanctioned during the week.   These schemes, it will be seerf, rely largely on the Military and Auxiliary Hospitals, owing to the paucity of oivil hospitals, and difficulty will be experienced in many districts in meeting the requirements of the- War Office in regard to the restricted use of Military Hospitals.16.    Individual eases of Treatment.    The great bulk of cases of treatment, are under general schemes which have received -approval,, but a small number of cases requiring specialjtreatment or treatment in institutions for which approval has not previously been given are submitted each week.^During the week ended 14th November, 134 such cases were so.sanctioned.IV.   Numbers under treatment.   Appendix XII shows the number, of men for whom treatment had been provided under arrangements made or approved by the Ministry and to whom allowances underArticle
Article 6 of the Royal Warrant are payablei    It will be seen that 387 cases were admitted for treatment during the week ended the 14th November and that 2881 men were under treatment on that date, as compared with 2616 men at the endof the previous week.The. Table shows also the nature of the disablementsfor which treatment was required, and it will be seen that more than two-fifths of the cases are of wounds or injuries 2\ per cent being cases of paraplegia.   96 cases of neurasthenia are under treatment at Solders Green and 34 of advanced tuberculosis in the hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board in London.   The number of discharged men in Lunatic asylums who have been admitted J.0 the benefit of the special arrangements for &quot;Service Patients&quot; referred to in previous reports was, on the 14th instant, 868.   Of these 22 had been admit ted during tho week.Cinema OperatorsArrangements have now been made for special training in cinema operating at nine centres, viz:y London, Glasgow, Newcastle, Manchester, Liverpool, Birmingham, Cardiff, Soutnampton, and Leeds.    The applications for trained men at good wages are very numerous.    It is hoped to train between 300 and 400 men each year.Trade Advisory Committees.    Reports of the meetings of the Trade Advisory Committees held during the week ended the 14th November are contained in Appendix XIII.   The Printing and kindred trades, with the exception of the Bookbinders, have agreed to admit disabled men into the trade and it is hoped that the Bookbinders will rescind a resolution to the contrary. In certain processes of the Building trade it was agreed that a disabled man should 3pend a probationary period of six weeks in a technical school which would serve both to test hisphysical
Physical capacity and to render more easy his transition -   from hospital to workshop.    In the Bookmaking trade it is proposed to advocate the establishment of national factories for training disabled men in the hand-sewn boot and shoe trade and in boot and shoe repairing.Training&apos;and Employment.20,      General Schemes of Training.   Appendix XIV contains notes on schemes submitted by the Local Committees of Isle of Man, Liverpool, Dublin, Aberdeen, Barnsley, and Flintshire which have been sanctioned and notes on schemes submitted by the Local Committees of Kent, London, Bath, Inverness, Wrexham and Worcestershire which are under consideration.21.       Individual cases of Training.   During the week 67 cases of training outside approved schemes were sanctioned; in 181 cases further information has been asked for on modification of the proposals suggested.22.       Number of men under Training.   Appendix XV shows that 59 men were admitted to and 14 discharged from training by Local Committees during the week and that the total number reported as under training at the end of the week was 727.23.       Training for Widows.   Definite arrangements have now been arrived at with London Institutions whereby the widows and dependants of officers and men will be admitted to training on the same favourable terms as those which already obtain in the case of disabled men.In paragraph 32 of last weetfs report reference was made to the training of Widows by Messrs Debenham and Freebody Appendix XVI gives an extract from a letter from Mr. Ernest Debenham, the Chairman and Managing Director, containing particulars with regard to the proposed training.   There aredefinite
definite positions at good salaries for 57 women in London while posts for 500 women as machinists and blouse makers are available in the Firm&apos;s factory in Nottingham. Training of Interned men in:-1.       Switzerland.   Appendix XVII contains a Report cn the training of British prisoners interned in Switzerland showing that progress is being made and that Swiss Manufacturers are giving their assistance.2.      Holland.     Lord Sandwich has returned from a visit to Holland where he has been endeavouring to make arrangements for training a large number of British Prisoners of War who are expected to reach Holland for internment at an early date. Lord Sandwich suggests that the most practical work would be to build dismountable houses which could easily be stored so as to house the Belgiums at the conclusion of the war and to make furniture (Appendix XVIII).Organisation.Reports of Inspectors.    Extracts from reports of Inspectors of Accounts for the week ended 14th November are contained in Appendix XIX.    In the West Riding both at Barnsley and Huddersfield a large number of advances is reported that at Huddersfield repayments are being rapidly made whilst the matter is being taken in hand at Barnsley.In the North West Area the Inspector reports that work of the Burnley Local Committee is well in hand but he was informed that tho Pension Issue Office is slack in the recovery of advances.   At Accrington allowances for treatment and training are Increasing.   The Boctlo Committee are concerned about the ratos of pay of men in tho Mercantile Marine but that matter is not within the sphere of this Department.   AtLiverpool
9 9 9C U d/ %Liverpool allowances are in order.   The Waterloo-with-Seaforth Committee pay rent allowances with coupons which the landlords present for payment.In the South Wales Area the Monmouthshire Committee complain of delay in the appointment of Medical referees and enquiry officers;    the Pontypool Urban Sub-Committee lack organisation whilst the Bedwas (Committee have got a good grip of their work.   The Cardiganshire Committee are realising the serious problem before them.   Mountain Ash finds difficulty in the inaccessibility of its sub-committees whose working men Secretaries can only give their evenings to the work.    In Radnorshire the grants and allowances are on a low scale as the percentage of enlistments was low whilst separation allowance is higher than the ordinary wage.The reports on the London Sub-Committees are, with one slight exception, very satisfactory.Staff etc.26.     Numbers of Staff.     Appendix XX shows an addition of 40 to the staff of the Ministry during the week, the chief additions being 28 to the Pension Issue Office and 11 to Treatment and Training.   The staff on the books of the Ministry now comprises 292 men and 4,588 women, or 4,880 in all.The daily percentage of absences during the week was 3, among the male and 4.3 among the female staff.27&apos;     Accommodation.     The Annexe to the Offices of the Crown Agents for the Colonies adjoining V-ostminstor House has now been occupied by the staff of the Ministry and there have been transferred to it the Naval and Officers Awards&apos; Branches, the Central Registry, and some sections of tho Special Grants Committee which have been removed from several houses in Abingdon Street,Tne
The accommodation at headquarters is still below the requirements and a request has been sent to Office of Works for additional premises.   The Ministry from its inception has had no room for expansion with the result that when the expansion has come outside premises have had to be secured. At the present moment the main branches of the Ministry are located in 12 buildings and houses. 28.     Index.

APPENDIX   VI. TEE PENSION APPEALS TRIBUNAL.Before the Ministry of Pensions may award a pension a discharged disabled man it is necessary for the fact to be established that his disability is attributable to or has been aggravated by his military or naval service.    The Minister of Pensions is by statute the sole interpreter cf the Rcyal Warrant, and it follows that there is an appeal to him from the decisions of the officers cf the Ministry and that his judgment is final. Since it was not in practice possible for the Minister himself to act as a Court of Appeal in doubtful cases, he set up the Appeal Tribunal to hold enquiries and to advise him in the exercise of his statutory discretion.   The Appeal Tribunal is, therefore, a personal creation by the Minister of Pensions and is part of the machinery of the Ministry;    it is in no sense a Court of Enquiry into the acts of the Ministry   and has no authority to pass censure upon them.    Its functions are solely to determine questions of fact; namely are the disabilities of individual claimants to whom pensions have been refused attributable to or aggravated by their war service?   If the Tribunal judges after investigation that they are, it advises accordingly, and the Minister accepts that advice as binding upon him.Up to November 7th there have been 1,463 appeals lodged by men who claim that their disabilities entitle them tc pensions. Of these 313 deal with points outside the terms of reference to the Tribunal and 578 cases have after special enquiry been decidod by the Ministry in favour of the appellants.    The Appeals Tribunal has heard 101 cases, has decided -18 in favour of the man&apos;s claim to pensions, has decided 36 against:them and has adjoined 17 for further hearing.   There are 191 additional cases ready for the Tribunal but they have not yet been heard, and the remainder 480, of the appeals are in various stages of preliminary invest!-gation.The first decision cf the Tribunal was issued on August 21st, and it soon became apparent that the appeal procedure must be greatly accelerated if the claims cf men, who had been rejected previously, were to be determined within a reasonable time, &quot;it was, therefore, decided to re-investigate all the cases of discharged disabled men who have been refused pensions on the ground that their disabilities wore net due tc or aggravated by V/ar Service.    This re-investigation is being carried out by Special Sub-Committees of the Local War Pensions Committees cf whic there are more than 300 in various parts of the Country.    These Sub Committees with whom are associated the Medical referees appointed recently by tho Ministry have been instructed to interview the men whose claims tc pension had been refused, collect all relevant evidence, obtain the opinion cf the medical referees, and report tc the Ministry in detail.   These enquiries by the Special Sub-Committees do not in any way prejudice the right of men to appeal to the Tribunal;   they are designed to aid the Ministry   In exercising his statutory discretion and to bs a means of relieving the Tribunal of hearing cases in which reasonable grounds are found to exist for concluding that pensions have been erroneously withheld.   The Minister hopes that, through the agency of this loca investigation of all rejected cases, it may be possible to diminish the number cf difficult appeals and so to enable the Tribunal to catch up with those arrears which show a tendency to accumulate.

The Special Mo&amp;ioal Board will Arrange for the men to be visited when necessary and may require the menrs attendance in London once every four weeks. Arrangements will be made by the Local Committee for the men to be treated fry a panel doctor under the Insurance Act in accarianoe with the usual arrangements made under the kq%94. Payment of the Board and Lodging. V/here paymeat is asked for it will not exceed 16/&apos;- a week.   This sum will be paii by the Local Committee out of the manrs allowance direct to the house-holder.5, Instructions to Householdert Instructions shall be sent accenting as the case is a neurasthenic or shellshock case to the householder by the Local Committee when arrangements are made for the man&apos;3 treatment.Directions to acocmpany a &quot;Shell-Shook&quot; case.Cause of the condition:- &quot;Shell-shock is due to emotional Tibturbanco e.g. tho terror accompanying being buries alive by mines, or shell-explosions, it io possible also that the concussion of bursting 3hells may actually damage the fine cellular tissues of the brain.Symptoms:-   All these depend on the lost power of the consoiouo reasoning part of the mind, over the subconscious emotional mind; this loss of control manifests itself ohiofly by disorders of tho muscles and of the organs of the speoial senses, the eye, *ar, etc.Lost control over the muscles produces, tremor, spasms, temporary   paralysis, stammering etc, the usual sensory symptoms are lost sight, hearing, speeoh, ordinary sensation, etc. all these are temporary and curable.The patient is also nervous in a general way, and subjeot to dreams often relating to his pact experiences - battle dreams - he tends also to beoome introspective, ani &quot;sorry for himself&quot;.Treatment:-   The patient should be removed, from others suffer-ing in the same way as himself, as one reacts detrimentally upon another, removed also from the noise and rush of towns to the peace and quietness of the oountry, and from the harmful and awestruck sympathy of friends and neighbours, he is indeed astricken
q o nstrlaken Hero, but it is not well that he should.-oocUzrually think of himself as such, nor should others tell nim so.His &quot;host&quot; in the oountry should bo kind, just and confident as to the pensioners recovery, but should avoid paswring and sentimentality.   Thoso dealing with the patient should entirely disregard any peculiarities h9 may exhibit, e.g tremors, stammering otc, as if indeed they were not notioable, &apos; for all these hysteroid symptoms live ar.d thrive upon notoriety and fade away and disappear when treated with silent contempt. This may be oalled the passive side of the treatment.   The active treatment consists in surrounding the patient with an atmosphere of steady an  unshakoable confidence that recovery is cure to tako plaoo and oeoondly, to persuade or as nearly as may be oompel the invalid to redirect his attention upon things outBide of himself, this is the only way to restore his lost powers of oontrol, and is managed by getting tho patient interested ofc at least perform some peaceful form of work or play.   It is by using his personal influence in getting the men to work or to play in an unexciting manner that tho &quot;hosts&quot; oan best help thoir guests and if they can achieve thiB then sucoesS i3 as certain as the day spring after the night.   The patients should not at first be put in any position of responsibility though towards the end of their course they may become capable of thiSj their work should also bo under safe oonditiona, by which I mean, not in relation with machinery, nor abovtf ground levels nor in traffic.   If the above treatment io followed out there is no risk to the patientss mind or body, and reoovery is humanly speaking a oertainty.   If the pensioner refuses to do his part of tho course the fault and the mis-fortune are of course his own, but I am oonvinoed that tho taotful &quot;host&quot; will be rejoiood by finding permanent good results in practioally every oase.I shall be pleased to answer any special enquiries, in relation to any of tho oases.Directions to aooompany a Neurasthenic case,Oauae of the conditions:-   Neurasthenia or nervous weakness, is a state of general debility resulting from overwork, worry, and undernourishment, indigestion and sleeplessness may be either causes or results.The &quot;Brgogen&quot; or mother substance of energy, whioh should exist in the brain cello, has been used up and must be reaocum*latod before the patient oan got well.Symptoms:- The patient becomes woak as far as his aotions are concerned* but curiously enough he becomes more than usually censlti\*e as regards the peroep&apos;,. on of sensations especially suob, ajs gtfise within his own body, hence the innumerable aches end paifis whioh he Buffers from,   There is a feeling of brain ategy laok of energy, sleeplessness, aching of tho back, and hoad, irritability eto.   Indigestion iD almost always present and many other functional disorders are apt to ooour these are called functional because although all the organs may bo perfectly healthy they are unable to do their work properly since they do not receive the normal orders from headquarters (the brain). Suoh patients are always introspective,,   All these symptoms are due to either deficient income or excessive expenditure of the ergogen in the brain cells*Treatment:- It is neoesoary to reverse the above process, theinoome
9 9 Qk d 0income must be increased, and the expenditure dinjinished thus good food and rest are what are inquired.   The food must be taken in as great quantity ae possible without upsetting the digestion and milk, eggs, and other simple country rare are exactly what is best for such a case.   Absence of noiee, and all of sources of exoitement are essential.   The first third of the oourse of treatment should be devoted to almost complete rest, the patient should have as much sleep as possible and the fresh air of the country will help in this direction. He should go to bed early and get up late post of the day should be spent outside in a hammock or deck chair.During the second part of the time the neurasthenic may begin to do a little light work, but the hours should be short and rest and exercise should be interspersed.During the last third of the course the patient may take ordinary exeroiso freely or do full work in order to harden the muscles and confirm the cure.The pensioner should be weighed at regular intervals as this gives a good indication as tc his progress; if he i3 putting on weight 0350 may rest assured that he getting on well.An atmosphere of cheerful confidenoe in recovery is required, and it is well while showing tho patient every klnd-noss not to be over sympathetic and rather to disregard his (often exaggerated) description of his discomforts.If the &quot;host&quot; is in any doubt as to the patients condition the panel doctor may be called in to see him.
APPENDIX XDISCHARGED SOLDIERS SUFFERING  FROM NEURASTHENIA.Local Government Board,Whitehall, S.W. 1. 22nd October, 1917.Sir,I am directed by the President of the Local Government Board to transmit for the consideration of the Guardians the appended memorandum which he has been requested by the Minister of Pensions to circulate.Mr. Hayes Fisher is sure that tlie Guardians and their officers will be anxious to co-operate with the Minister in the manner suggested in the memorandum.Additional copies of this circular are enclosed for the use of the Institutional Medical Officers.I am, Sir,Your obedient Servant,A. V. Symonds, Assistant Secretary.ToThe Clerk to the Guardians.MEMORANDUM.Ths attention of the Minister of Pensions has been called to certain cases of discharged soldiers suffering from Neurasthenia or epilepsy and that symptom of these conditions which is described as &quot; automatic wandering &quot; and is often accompanied by loss of memory. In these cases soldiers have found their way to Poor Law Institutions and have there been detained for observation in the mental ward, and in some instances eventually sent to a Lunatic Asylum.In cases of this type it is suggested that where any such men are received in a Poor Law Institution an enquiry might be addressed to the Special Medical Board for Neurasthenics at 78, Lancaster Gate, W., to ascertain whether Neurasthenia was the cause of discharge from the Army, and that that Board&apos;s reply may be awaited before arriving at a definite conclusion as to the class of case to which any particular man may belong, and especially before any steps are taken to send the cases to a Lunatic Asylum.Ministry of Pensions.October, 1917.(5087.)

TRAINING.Trade, Advisory Gomelttcas and the Tarlning of Disabled Men* RepGrt for Week ending November 14th 1917.It is interesting to note that all branches of the Printing an* Kindred Trades have now agreod to actmit disabled men not formerly employed in1 the trade with the exooption of the Bookbinders.On Mefciay October 29th a resolution was subir/Utoc? to tho Trade Advisory Committee for Printing from the Emergency and Executive Committee of the Bookbinders In which tliey refused to admit any disabled men not formerly employed in tho trade.It was decided that Ut* Heath and Mr, Holmes tho secretary of the mcn!s federation should go on a deputation to thcm*   The Reputation met tho Executive Committoe of tho National Union of Bookbinders on Friday November 9thu   Mir chief difficulty was their fo-ar that the trade would be flooded with men*   The deputation explained to xhem that it was the intention of tho Ministry of Pensions to set up &amp;ocal Technical Advisory Committees who would only admit fresh mon if both sides agreed that there was room in the trade for them.If the Bookbinding Union refused to ccme into tho scheme all that would happen woul* be that Local War Portions Committees would be loft to make their own negotiations and the only weapon of tho trade unionists would bo a strike which nc one dosiros,   If on the oth.Gr hand they come into the scheme men would only to introduced under a plan approved by tho Printing Trade as a whole.   The Sxeoutivo Committee revorsed their previous decision and agreod to recommend to tho larger Emergency Committee that this course should bo adopted.   It is understood that tho larger Committee is sure to adopt this recommendation.1.   PRINTING.   November 12th.At s meeting of the largo Committee the whole of tho suggestions from tho Sub Committee re training of disabled mon were approved and it was agreod that, oopies of this should be sent out for submission to the Executive Committees of the various trado unions.The question of training for warehousemen and proof-readers was left in the hands of the Sub Committee.2.   CINEMA,   Novomber 13th.Nowcastlo Branch Training Contra Committoe. The secretary reported that this Committee was fully constituted and had hold its first meeting.Aberdeen, a suggestion received from tho Ministry of Pensions from tho Aberdeen Local war Pensions Committee for the establish-ment of a training centre in Aberdeen was considered by the Committee.   Tho Committee reported favourably on the proposaland
and Mr. Kimberley, the technical advisor, was instructed to visit Aberdeen with a view to the establishment of a Branch Training Centre Committee.

3. BUILDING. November 13th.

It was agreed that in the case of training for all these processes, namely, Painting, Plumbing, Wood-Machining, Plastering, Masonry, and Bricklaying a preliminary period of six weeks should be spent in a technical school wherever possible in order to test the physical capacity of the man and to make a transition period between the hospital and the actual work under workshop conditions.

The Building Trade Advisory Committee also agreed to accept the suggestion of the Ministry of Pensions that during the second six months of training a flat rate of 17/6 a week should be paid in maintenance allowance irrespective of the amount contributed in wages by tho employer.

Unfortunately, it has not yet been possible to arrange a deputation to the Executive Committee of the Carpenters and Joiners but it is hoped that a deputation will meet them on November 30th.

It was agreed not to send forward the recommendations to the Ministry of Pensions until a report was received with regard to the Carpenters and Joiners.

From informal reports received at the Committee it seems likely that the Carpenters and Joiners will reverse their previous decision in the light of fresh information.

4. BOOT REPAIRING SUB COMMITTEE. November 14th.

The members of the Sub Committee who are going as a deputation to the War Office met to prepare their case. It is proposed to appeal for the establishment of national factories for the teaching of the art of hand-sewn boot and shoe making and boot and shoe repairing to disabled sailors and soldiers. It is claimed that the hand-sewn boot and shoe making trade should be revived and it is suggested that the means to be submitted to the War Office would effect this. It is also proposed to submit to the War Office the desirability that supplies of leather and of work should be placed at the disposal of the technical schools where the training of disabled soldiers and sailors is now being arranged together with facilities for these schools to obtain the necessary machinery instead of being dependant, as they are at the present time, upon hiring machines from private firms. The present hiring system handicaps these institutions because the machines are liable to be taken away at any time by the firms for private trade purposes.

9 h&quot;itAP.-1N0IX XVIITRAINING.REPORT OK THE TRAINING CF BRITISH PRISONERS INTERNED INSWITZERLAND,In consequence of the re-arrangements and transfers of the various camps, together with the postponement oi arrival of fresh drafts from Germany, there has been some delay in starting the various Courses&apos;of Traininge    A commencement has however, been made in most of the Trades which have been arranged and by the end of the month it is anticipated all will be in full working order,A large number of men is expected to arrive between now and Xmas and provision is being made for two additional Trades to be started, viz. Fancy Leather Bags and Watch Repairing,It is interesting to note that in connection with the latter the Swiss Manufacturers have very kindly helped in the equipment of the workshop, and Messrs Longines have been specially generous *    For this interest we are indebted to Mr, Oscar Fresard, one of the largest retail Watch Dealers in Switzerland, Mr, Fresard has also been good enough to offer his services as Hon3 Supervisor of the Training, whilst the English Watch-makers Association have undertaken to provide situations for 100 men on their return to England who prove efficient In their training 0It is regretted that Major Charley, who is to be the officer appointed to supervise the Courses of Training, is still detained at home.     His presence in Switzerland is very essential and it is hoped he will be able to leave this month.Lt. Wallis, the superintendent of the Llotor School, has, we are glad to state, been seconded for the work at Vevey and we anticipate his being able to leave next week.
TRAINING.INTERNED BRITISH PRISCNUciS CJP v^H ID HOLLAND.IHTRiOTS 2RQM -a R3PORT BY LORD SANDWICH.It is difficult at this stage to estimate the nunber of men who will be able to work for seme 5 houro a day as in Switzerland at the present time.   If the large numbOr of invalid solars arc tc be sent to tho latter country and not ix.to Holland, it would appear that tho N.COrs will form the bulk cf the numbers to bo catered for.   It is not yot known In what condition they will be for work, how many will be suffering from &quot;Barbed wire&quot; diseaso requiring rest; It is to Too hoped hrwevcr, that thero will be more moral driving force available to induce the mon to work, and moro facilities offorei than i* the -nase of the camp of the interned naval division at Groningon which I -fisitcd.   I inspected a good many available roor&amp;s in tho Hague itself, b^it soon came to the conclusion that for purposes of working hours in the daytimo they wero too far from the district where the men are to bo housed to be of any uso.   There is one largo rooa and a garage that could bo acquired at Ityswiok, if at a later stago it is docided to plaoo any men in that district.At the request of Sir Francis Oppcnhoimcr, tho Commercial Att^ohe at tho Legation, I proparod a momo of the work that was being started in Switzerland and what it was proposed to undortako for Holland.I havo oc-mo to the conclusion th^t tho most practical work to undertake would be to build hutB on suitable molds whioh are dismountable and easily stored, to bo either sold or prosonted to Belgium at the conclusion of tho war, and also to make furniture.   I think we could obtain all tho timber wo should require in Holland.Tho building of huts entails a certain amount of angle iron, nuts, bolts, etc.   This will givo opportunity for a certain amount of smith1 s work.A good doal of furniture oan bo nado with deal, such as beds, tables, ohosts or drawers, cupboards, chairs and tho like.A commandant of Engineers, Captain Bon*iot, working at Delft University has offered his services to conduct a class in telegraphy, electric motors, electric metallurgy oto. Dr. Roth of Dordrooht, who has an orthopacdio factory there, has offered to train seme men in his establishment.

An energetic Secretary is endeavouring to keep the work up to the proper standard.RADNORSHIRE LOCAL COMMITTEE.There are seven District Committees covering Petty Sessional Division areas.    The District Committees make grants in urgent cases only.    The grants and allowances generally are on a small scale;   this is attributable to the low percentage of enlistments and to the fact that the Separation Allowance is higher than the average wage.    The Secretary is emphatic that in his opinion there
is no distress or dissatisfaction in the County.MONTGOMERY LOCAL COMMITTEE.Population 53,000, Industry chiefly agriculture.

&apos;M ej teWATERLOO WITH SEAFORTH.A large number of case papers examined and found tobe In order.There is one feature about this Local Committee to 7/hich the Inspector wishes to draw attention, namely, that the rent allowances are paid in coupons and not in ea$h, the coupons being eventually presented for payment by the landlords.     The Committee regard this as being the best -ay to ensure that the allowances shall be used for the purpose for which they were intended, but the Inspector doubts whether the Ministry will approve of this principlA large amount of work is done and good attention is given to cases,BOOTLB LOCAL COMMITTEE.The case papers examined show the allowances to be in order,    There is a considerable reduction in the amount paid out since the Inspectorrs previous visit and revision of esses.The qiestion of men in the Mercantile Marine causes difficulty to this Committee as their cases cannot be assisted by the Local Committee and their rates of pay have ..iCt been increased during the war although there has been a large rise in divilian Mercantile Rates *     The Inspector remarks that if the Regulations could be amended tc cover such cases It would be greatly appreciated.This Committee finds that the assessment for Dependants Allowances is very lev/ and not in accordance with the facts as stated to them.LOKDCN LOCAL COMMITTEE.London City Sub-Committee.Ho infringements of the Regulations found.
