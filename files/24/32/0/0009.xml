[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majestys Government.]Printed for the War Cabinet.   November 1917.SECRET. G.T-2609.WAGES AND PRICES.Memorandum by the First Commissioner of Works.THE memorandum by the Minister of Labour, dated the 29th October, 1917, on Wages and Prices (Paper No. G.T.-2465), apparently advocates a further increase inHhe excess profits tax. If any decision is to be taken on this question, I hope the following views, which are shared by a very large number of manufacturers, will receive due consideration:  1. Although the excess profits tax has been loyally accepted, its incidence has been unjust, and has borne most heavily on any business which was in a state of development before the outbreak of war, and which is now paying away in taxation, apparently as excess profits, those profits which would have come to it in any event as a result of the previous expenditure of capital. The greater the tax is made the greater the injustice becomes.2. The controlled works by the Ministry of Munitions Act, which had a direct bargain with the Government, that was agreed to in order to satisfy the demands of labour, have had to consent to the entire arrangement between them and the Ministry of Munitions being swept away under the Finance Act of last year. The fact that there was no more opposition to the steps then taken was largely due to the fact that in many instances the new arrangement proposed was more favourable than the old arrangement; but, if the excess profits tax be now raised from 80 per cent, to practically 100 per cent., the controlled works would very rightly have a very serious grievance.It is only right to point out that, after all, efficiency of production depends as much, if not more, on the energy and work in the direction of industrial enterprise as on the exertion of manual labour. Although manufacturers have very loyally, on the whole, done their utmost, under most harassing and difficult circumstances, to assist the Government in every direction to obtain increased production, a good deal of discontent as to their treatment undoubtedly exists, which must be reckoned with as a serious factor in national production. To men accustomed to business all their lives, the idea of putting forth a great effort, with no financial result to show, is, on the whole, very difficult to accept. From my own experience, I know to what an extent the heavy taxation already existing tends to depress employers, especially among the staffs of large industrial concerns. If all inducement is taken away, which would be the case under the proposal of the Minister of Labour, the result must, in my opinion, lead to a general relaxation of energy, with very serious results. The instance mentioned in the memorandum, without any detailed explanation, is, of course, one of the many instances of a tendency in labour papers to make capital out of a particular instance. I fail to understand how the information respecting the profits of this company has been obtained. On looking up the reference to the company in the Stock Exchange Year Book, I find that the accounts and information in regard to the dividends on the ordinary shares are not published. I would suggest the proper method of rendering it impossible for undue profiteering to exist, if it does exist, would be to fix reasonable maximum prices for the articles produced. To allow balance-sheets with largely inflated profits to be published, then to take away the greater part of these profits under an excess profits tax, does not offer any financial advantages, and certainly does not seem to meet the demands of labour, as will be noticed from the fact that in this article referred to by the Minister of Labour no mention whatsoever is made of the 80 per cent, excess profits tax that is payable on the profits quoted. [1174]f&apos;7
As regards paragraph 5 of Mr. Roberts&apos; memorandum, it is quite true that the employer has less interest in resisting the demands for higher wages than in normal times, and if the whole of the excess profits are taken he would have still less interest, as already a tendency exists to say that, as the only difference in paying workmen higher wages or not consists in paying the Exchequer less, under excess profits, there is not much object in getting on bad terms with the men. Such a tendency, however, is largely illusory, as in most industries wages are fixed by Government arbitrators, and employers have very little influence on the course of wages, and such a tendency will be increased.A very important point to which attention is directed is that already the excess profits tax is depriving industry seriously of working capital, and will seriously handicap British industry in comparison with that of other countries after the war. I would like to refer in connection with this matter to the very weighty letter by Sir Algernon Firth that appeared in the &quot;Times&quot; of the 12th instant on excess profits. The German manufacturer, who has paid no excess profits, but has invested the same in war loan, will, at the end of the war, find it much easier to obtain credit for the extension of his business than the British manufacturer, whose profits have been paid away in taxation, and who has no security to offer in consequence for a loan for further business.I would venture to suggest that there is a method which probably would satisfy labour, and would at the same time get. over the difficulty which is generally recognised, i.e., that companies should not be allowed to distribute any dividends to their shareholders of a larger amount than their pre-war standard, and that the balance of excess profits should be invested in some form of war loan security. Workmen, who have really quite as great an interest as employers in the stability and future development of industry, would, I think, recognise that this is a reasonable and fair arrangement.ALFRED MOiSfD.His Majesty s Office of Works, November 13, 1917.o
