(This Document is the Property ofHis Britannic Majesty^ Government.)H3.649.II  SUMMARY 01? BLQG&amp;ADE IflffOKMATIOflIfov. 9-15. 1917.EBElg FIHAflCE AffD EXPORTS.In the week ending My. 13 the mark: fluctuated to an extraordinary extent on the Scandinavian bourses.   At Copenhagen the rate on Thursday the 8th was 39.50.   On Friday and Saturday it stood at 48.   On Monday it fell to 41, and on Tuesday rose again to 45.   In Norway the rise was lees sensational and the relapse was more marked;    on the 8th the Christiania rate was 40; on Saturday and Monday it was 44; on Tuesday it fell to 40.50.   The Stockholm rate on the 8th was 33; on Friday the &amp;th it rose to 36; but last Wednesday it fell to 33.75.   Presumably these changes were due to sensational reports from Petrograd.   At Zurich the rate rose gradually from 61.25 on Wednesday, the 7th, to 64 on Saturday the 10th, but relapsed to 63.20 on Monday.It is reported that in the first week of November a consignment of gold worth from 15 to 20 million kroner was exported to Berlin from Stockholm via Denmark.   lo explanation of this remarkable transfer is forthcoming.   But the need for gold in Germany must be extraordinary, if this sum can be more usefully employed at Berlin than in redressing the extremely low rate of the mark exchange in Btockholm.The general embargo on exports from the Allied countries to the northern neutrals has created new openings for German and Austrian trade.   Sweden for example, has developed a taste for German champagne, and the drapers of Stockholm are obtaining from Vienna goods wMchthey used to order in London and Paris.   Ihe German piano is capturing the Swedish, Norwegian and Dutch markets.   The Danish daily press has been propitiated with consignments of German printing paper, and the Danish shipping yards   have unexpectedly received fromGermany sufficient iron and steel to carry them over the winter.
HE BLOCKADE.     Certain decisions have already &quot;been reached the Blockade Conference of the Allies, which is now sitting in London :-(a) Negotiations vdth Norway are to he placed inthe hands of the Allied Ministers at Christ!ania. They are instructed to demand the entire cessa-tion of all exports, whether direct or indirect, to our enemies;   but in the last resort they may allow the export of Norwegian fish to Germany at the rate of 40,000 tons per annum,   They will insist on the maintenance of &quot;one present Soraregian exports to the Allies, and on reasonable facilities for the transit traffic over the Norwegian railways.(b) Negotiations with Denmark will be resumed at - Washington when the principles of a generalagreement with Ilorway have been agreed upon. It is not desirable that the Norwegians should learn of our intention to give Denmark a certain latitude in respect of agricultural exports to Germany, until they have accepted the much more drastic restrictions which we propose to put on the Norwegian export-trade.Mr. Hellner, the Swedish Minister for Foreign Affairs has submitted certain proposals to Sir E. Howard, which may serve as the basis of a general agreement between oweden and the Allies,   He has al3o suggested that two Swedish nego-tiatftrs should come to London.   H.H. Government have replied that the Swedish delegates if invested with full powers to conclude an agreement will he welcome;   but they should come promptly, as otherwise they v/ill miss the opport-unity of meeting the United States representatives, whose stay in London will be very brief.   Mr. Hellner offers full guarantees against the re-export to the Central Empires of goods imported with the help of the Allies.   But he will not allow the transit to Russia of munitions or of any commodities which are urgently required in oweden.   iie is only prepared to restrict in some unspecified degree the exports of Iron Ore and iietals from Sweden to Germany.   He offers a Shipping Agreement which would be more advantageous to Sweden than to the Allies.
Our dispute with the Netherlands, respecting the transit of sand, gravel and other war materials from Germany to Belgium is still unsettled;   and all Dutch commercial cables to and from the Dutch Colonies or neutral countries are still being stopped in London, even when they are despatched by the Dutch Government.   An exception is only made in favour of cables to or from Allied countries which clearly relate to Allied business.   M. Lou&amp;on, however, persists in fulfilling bis engagement to Berlin.   He will not detain any cargo of sand and gravel which has entered Dutch waters before Uov. 15 until the stipulated quantity of 370,000 tons has passed the Belgian frontier,    here is some fear that he may not even observe his own time-limit.   He has been infomed that the embargo on Dutch cables will not be raised until the Dutch Government have given us satisfaction for this breach of in-ternational law.    It appears that the tra&amp;ers of Amsterdam and Rotterdam are seriously alarmed by the continued suspension of cable facilities.   H.M. Legation has taicen pains to inform them, through the Dutch Press, of the reasons for which we object to this transit traffic.We learn from Paris of the existence of a submarine postal service between Geruujiy and Barcelona.   She mails are despatched in both directions by way of Huelva.   The submar-ines are met off the Cantabrian coast by Spanish trawlers; there is a German agent in Barcelona who collects the outward mfeil and sends it to Huelva;   the inward mail is posted at Huelva by the captains of the trawlers.SCAKDI&amp;AYIA.   The Scandinavian countries are now thoroughlyalarmed at the straits in which they find themselves.   In Den-mark it i3 the shortage of raw materials and of petroleum which causes the greatest anxiety.     The London Blockade Con-fsrenoe has decided that no petroleum shall be allowed to
reach Denmark from overseas until a general agreement is con-cluded between the Danish Government and the Allies;   and this is the most powerful form of pressure which we can supply at present.   But it is anticipated that by the Hew Year at least 50/o of the artisans and factory hands in Denmark: will be out of work;   and there is a fear that large numbers of the unemployed will be tempted by the offer of high wages to migrate to Germany The Danish Government realise that such emigrants would not easily be recalled;   and Sir B* Paget has been asked whether we could not find temporary work in the United Kingdom for some of the unemployed.Sweden is perturbed because the German Government have not yet supplied the grain and potatoes which they promised, and have made no definite agreement to supply coal during lovember and December.   Sir E. Howard apprehends that, unless we take prompt measures to relieve Sweden1 s necessities, the new Cabinet will be discredited and public opinion will insist upon a German alliance as the only means of escaping from an impos-sible situation.   The lorwegian tfood Controller announces that on the most favourable estimate he can only provide a daily ration of  00 grammes of bread for the next ten months;   the bread will contain considerably more than dQfo of home grown oats and barley;    and there will be little or no grain available as a reserve for army supplies.   l!he Norwegian margarine factories are working half time, and a famine of edible fats is imminent, unless means are found of utilising fish oils for human con-sumption.ARGETO&amp;E   QRAlfl.     It is expected that the Argentine Government will remove the embargo on the export of wheat about Dec. 1. Ueutrals have already begun to arrange their purchases in anticipation of this event.   The Dutch Government in particu-lar are negotiating for half a million tons or more.   Although
Grand Total...... 52,265     &quot;       &quot;Total British____ 21,427     &quot;      &quot;H. W. CARLBSS DAVIS. ---------------oOo-----------------War Trade Intelligence Department 16th lov. 1917.the Argentine wheat surplus is estimated at 2,500,000 tons, the British and French Governments are anxious that no time should he lost in securing as much as possible of this amount for the Allies.   The surplus available for export from Uorth America is only 133 million bushels (about 3,600,000 tons), and the monthly requirements of the Allies are over forty million bushels (1,100,000 tons).   The United States are not prepared to cooperate in financing the Argentine pur-chases; but their financial representatives in London are recommending that the State Department should join the French and British Governments in asking the Argentine Government and the Argentine banks to work out a scheme for the financing of the Allies1 purchases.SUBMARINE BLOCKADE.     The following is a summary of the losses to merchant shipping, due to enemy activity, which were reported in the period Bov. 9-15, 1917 inclusive.
