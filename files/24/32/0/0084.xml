478 10Intelligence Bureau,Department of Information.CRW/030.WEEKLY REPORT ON RUSSIA.   XXX.(20 November, 19&amp;7).The Temporary Victgry of the Bolsheviks.It is difficult to believe that the victories of the Bolsheviksboth in Petrograd and Moscow can be anything but temporary.   They are simply due to the fact that for the moment there was no strongly organised force to oppose them.   Kerenski&apos;s troops were hastily collected and their heart was not in the struggle.   The army as a whole does not want civil war, but is looking for some set of people whose lead it can fallow.   It will not come out on the side of the Bolsheviks any more than it will on the side of Kerenski. The attitude of the Moscow garrison last week is a proof of this. Out of 100,000 troops in this district only 15,000 supported the Bolsheviks;   the rest remained in their barracks unwilling to interfere.The general apathy on the part of the civil population and of the soldiers is in a way a hopeful sign.    It shows that the bulk of the people are sick of politics and will welcome a strong  . Government.   Such a strong Government is already being formed in the South of Russia.    Its leaders, such as Kaledin, Kornilov, Alexeyev, Rodzyanko and Savinkov, seem to be acting slowly but methodically.   They are consolidating their positions in the South and preparing to starve Petrograd and Moscow into submission. They control the grain and coal centres of the South and neither Petrograd nor Moscow has sufficient food to hold out for many days.So far we have little news from the South save that Kaledin is working up with an army through the   Ukraine and getting control
of the chief industrial and railway centres there.   There is no news of the whereabouts of Rodzyanko, Savinkov  nd Milyukov, but there oan be no doubt that they are all in close touch with the Generals.A New Coalition.Towards the end. of October an interesting conference took place in Moscow.   The leading speakers were Rodzyanko. Brusilov and Ruzski.   At the end of the meeting it was decided to form a new National Democratic Bloc to be composed not of parties, but of all people who thought first of the State.    The difference between it and former Coalitions is the elimination of party. Each of Kerenski&apos;s Governments was a Ccalition of Parties, and his time was largely spent in playing off one party against another. As party strife became more and more acute the very foundations ofJhis Coalition became weaker.   His sudden collapse showed that an entirely different spirit was needed for any Coalition that could prove successful.The new National Democratic Bloc will consist of men of all parties and will be supported by the armed force of the Cossacks. Whether it will set up a strong National Government or a Military Dictatorship matters very little now, as any such Government would give full powers to the Generals who worked with it.     It would mean the return of Generals Brusilov, Alexeyev, Ruzski, Kornilov and Kaledin, and the adoption of their methods in the army.   As fee as political leaders go the outstanding figures might be Savinkov, Rodzyanko and perhaps Milyukov.   Savinkov was recently elected by the Cossacks to represent them in the Provisional Parliament.   At the same time he made it clear that he still remained a Social Revolutionary.   He has been excluded from the official party, but has not changed his political views.   Much the same may be said of
Rodzyanko.   Before the Revolution&apos;an Octohrlst, he too has now associated himself with the Cossacks and has lately been working along the same lines as Savinkov and others.   In contrast with the party strife now raging in Petrograd such a non-party Coalition offers the best hope for the future.20.11.17.
