Colonel JonesDocument fs the Pr^Hy ofIntelligence Bureau, Department of Information. Nov. 19th, 1917.The Situation in Switzerland,    (Continued)The follawing is the second instalment of a memorandum from a thoroughly trustworthy (3ritish) correspondent, who has quite recently returned from Switzerland.     The first instalment was circulated on Nov. 17th.(5)     The Economic Future.The Swiss have found themselves &quot;between the upper and the nether millstone during the war, and naturally wish to improve their nosition when the war is &quot;over.     Educated people are giving a great deal of thought to this.     If one raises the question of Swit3erland&apos;s economic resources, and whether they can be developed so as to secure Switzerland her economic independence, one ofen make a Swiss politician or journalist talk for several hours, and can obtain introduetions from him to all his friends, in order that they may t,*lk too.     Tongues are liosed still further if one hints at the possibility of writing an article in England expressing the Swiss point of view.The Swiss point of view - as explained to the citizen of an Entente country by Swiss citizens friendly to the Entente - is roughly as followsTho economic policy of the Entente towards Switzerland is so far merely negative,     Switzerland is regarded as a door into Germany, and the only objeot aimed at i3 to seal this door up. In order th tighten the blockade of Germany by an infinitesimal degree, tho Entente will not hesitate to do Switzerland an infinite amount ofeoonomic harm.     But in reality Switzerland is not merelyII
a door into Germany ; she is also an economic unit in herself - a market .and a source of production    a small but not a negligible quantity.     It is not a matter of indifference to the Entente whether tbis unit gravitates towards them or towards Germany - even considered &quot;from the economic point of view - while from the political point of view it may be a matter of serious importance.If the Entente blockades Switzerland ruthlessly in order to perfect the blockade of Germany, and if this policy is continued in an eoonomic war after the war, Switzerland will fee driven economlcal-lp ly - and in the end politically - into Germanyrs arms.     For Switzerland Is not yet, and perhaps never will be, a self-sufficient *conomio unit.     She must depend for the present upon some unit larger than herself, and if the Entente out her off she must turn to Germany or perish.What is wanted is a positive   polioy towards Switzerland on the part of the Entente - if not daring tho war at any rats as soon as it is ovsr.     Tho Entente should give Switzerland the facilities that would enable her to dispense with Germany:   markets and im-ports - coal, oapital, food-stuffs, colonial produce and manufactured artioles.     By helping Switzerland to gain &amp;er economic independence in collaboration xrith them, thoy will impose a far more effective barrier on Germany than any they oan impose by thoir presort policy of subjeoting Switzerland to an indiscriminate blockade.This argumont is of course formulated by the interested party, and does not answer tho charge that Switzerland has as a matter of fact re-oxported certain imports to Germany, which is of oourse the reason for the stringency of our blockado.     Yet the faot remains that, after tho war. Switzerland must gravitate either^Garmany or towards the Entonte, and that tho Swiss, whatover language they speak, decidedly prefer the latter alternativo.j
They know that if they gravitate towards Germany they will become her vassals.    Already she exacts tribute from them -tribute of food-stuffs and capital in exchange for her coal, and tribute of electrical power from Swiss waterfalls, which is run off into Germany a* power-oablos.     The extent of Switzerland&apos;s ex-ploited and unexploited hydraulic power, and the proportion of both categories whioh has passed already under the control of Germany, is a subject of burning interest in Switzerland, and one has only to discuss it with a Swiss to see how much Germany&apos;s oconomio penetra-tion is feared.On the other hand, the Swiss have an instinctive feeling that they would not run the same dangor if they made a rapprochement to-wards the Entente.    Without prejudice to the actual conduct of the Blockade, I believe there is room for Entente propaganda to stimu-late this feeling, to hold out the pro^eesrl of such a rapprochement, after the par, from the Entente side - in fact, to show that the aconomio policy of the Entente towards Switzerland can wear a positive as well as a negative aspect.     For example, an article by some prominent English economist suggesting that the &quot;League of Nations&quot; will have an econ6mic as well as a political bearing, and that Switeerland will obtain the economic independence she desires as a corollary to her entrance into the &quot;League of Nations&quot; after the war, would, I am oertain, create a great impression in Switzerland to our advantage.     It would be a sort of insurance against the possible political looses in the future which *re- necessarily -*un-by our Blockade pclioy during the war.It may be added that such propaganda would be equally useful for the ether small States on the pereiphery of the Central Empires; Holland and Belgium, the Scandinavian Kingdoms, the Balkan States, the new Poland, and any other States whioh Germany may succeed in
establishing an the East at Russia&apos;s expense.     These countries will be in the same relation as Switzerland, after the war, te Germany and the Entente respectively;    and the importance of the Swiss problem is increased by the fact that it is only one instance out of a large class.(6)   General Impressions.Arriving from England and Prance in Switzerland, one might imagine onoself passing from countries at peace into a country bt war.     Nothing could be more stalling than the change in the edonom-ic conditions when one cresses the Swiss frontier;   the bread-c/ard, the lack of bet water in the hotels, the badness of the train- : service, the prohibition to export anything mode of wool - including old clothes destined fcr Armenian or Serbian relief.   Even the -mobilisation strikes the eye.     The number of soldiers in the st*;eete and railway-stations is not noticeably less than in Prance England.     The cost of living has risen and is rising still, while work and wages have increased far less in proportion to it than in the countries at war.     Just as with us, there are war industries and war-profiteers, but in Switzerland as alsowhere the Effect of this has not beon so much tc increase the national wealth as to&apos;s distribute it even more unequally than it was distributed before, with a consequent aggravation of.the general misery.     The economic distress is the prevailing subject of conversation, and I r?nly \ found cne man who-vmaintained that Switzerland had suffered economically less than the belligerents.     This was the Catholic Bishop ef St. Maurice in the Valais.     He took the view that Switzerland had been specially spared by the grace of g^d, and that the economic shortage was a recent and comparatively trivial ^vil. But this view threw the prevailing, and contrary , opinion into greater relief.
^ t) (tAt the same time, I believe that this first impression is super-ficial.     The Swiss are much more cold and hungry than we are yot in England or Prance, but the war has not torn them hp by the roots as it has done with us.     &quot;Toujours ils ne se font pas tuer&apos;\   and, apart from that important fact, they have not suffered the same interruption of their normal lives which is universal here.I spent a day with a Professor at Lausanne.     Eis table ?/ascovered with new bocks - not war books mostly, but works of philo-vsophy or history.     He had time to read these books, and leasure of mind.     Next day term was opening, and his course of lectures was to begin.     The number of students was normal - was swelled,in faot, by French prisoners from Germany interned in Switzerland, and by all manner of refugees.     When I left him I felt that the Bishop of St. Maurice was right, and that Switzerland had been visited lightly by the v/ar.
