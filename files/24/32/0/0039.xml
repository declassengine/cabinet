Colonel Jores[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Msjestys Government.]Printed for the War Cabinet   November 1917.SECRET.THE LABOUR SITUATION.Report from the Ministry of Labour for the Week ending the 14th November, 1917.Summary.Parti: General Remarks.THE attitude of Labour towards developments in Russia is described.Part II: Press Opinions.The Labour press criticises the Government generally, and especially the action of the Food Controller and of the Coal Controller.Part III: District Reports.The 12^ per cent, increase has caused considerable unrest in almost all districts, London, Yorkshire, Lancashire, the Clyde, and Ulster in particular. Food prices and shortage are much canvassed at Woolwich, Coventry, Barrow, and in South Wales.Part IV: Strikes.A serious strike is in progress at Cowes owing to the dearness of coal. Other strikes have resulted from the 12  per cent, increase.The total number of strikes reported by the Labour Statistics Department is sixty-eight, an increase of thirteen from last week.Part V : Disputes.With the exception of that received from the Shipyard Labour Department the various reports received indicate a satisfactory state of affairs.The Committee on Production has partly heard a very important application from the Locomotive Enginemen and Firemen.I. General Remarks.Labour and the Russian Revolution.Since the failure of the Korniloff counter-revolution up to the present time the journals which represent Labour opinion have been almost silent on the subject of developments in Russia. It is, perhaps, legitimate to assume that their zeal for revolution on the Russian pattern has been somewhat mitigated by the realisation of the hopeless economic and political confusion, which have resulted.The recent news of the Maximalist coup has as yet afforded a topic of comment to the &quot; New Statesman &quot; and the &quot; Nation &quot; alone among the progressive papers. It was received too late for notice in the weekend Labour press, which will doubtless deal with it in the issues of the current week. There are, however, serious indications of a tendency to place the responsibility for the chaos in Russia on the shoulders of the British Government. In assuming this attitude the Labour organs will follow the lead given to them by the &quot; Nation,&quot; which is outspoken in its criticism. In the issue of the 10th November this paper writes: &quot; For the moment revolutionary Russia is out of all Alliances and Conventions, military or civil.   In our view she need never have been brought to this pass. [1100-4] B
She might never have reached it. had Mr. Hendersons entreaties and counsels been listened to. But at that critical hour England was in the hands of a Government without sympathy, and a press destitute of the power to think, feel, or know.&quot;After discussing the Kerensky interview, with its statement that Paissia is worn out, the article continues ; &quot; The Soviet meanwhile passed urgent resolutions for an immediate general peace. The Government and the Soviet were both preparing for the Allied War Aims Conference in Paris, naming their delegates and drafting instructions. We do not know what happened when Russia learned that Mr. Bonar Law had stated that the Paris Conference would not deal with war aims at all. But we can guess.&quot;The same attitude has been adopted by several of the papers in their discussions on the Kerensky interview. The &quot; Call;&apos; describes how the Allies &quot; by insults and vituperation have endeavoured to lash her into continuing the dance of death,&quot; charges the Allies with ignoring the interests of Russia, and condemns the attitude of the Entente as akin to treachery. &quot; Forward,&quot; probably the fairest of the more extreme papers, takes a saner view. It describes Russia as in agony, which cannot endure much longer : &quot; Meanwhile the Allies, never very keen about R,ussia&apos;s democratic notions, seem to have changed the purpose of the Conference which had been summoned todiscuss war aims.....My reading of the move is that the Allies do not wish tocommit themselves too much to the present uncertain Government of Russia, that they wish to be more free to pursue imperialistic projects than an agreement with Russia would leave them, that they see more clearly that their expectations of an early ending of the war were false, and that they have in consequence to devise new plans.&quot;This is a remarkably moderate statement of opinion, and may probably be taken as typical of the view of the more sober revolutionary school of thought. The &quot;Labour Leader&quot; expresses distinctive pacifist and I.L.P. opinion. In discussing the prospective Conference at Paris, and Mr. Bonar Law&apos;s statement as to its objects, the paper con-siders that the announcement has been received in Russia with something like consternation, and that its effect will be disastrous.&quot; It will be the culmination of innumerable acts on the part of the British Government which can bear no other interpretation in Russia than thai Great Britain has no regard for the well-being of the new democracy, but is willing that she should be left to become the prey of internal dissension and external attack.&quot;Criticism of an analagous kind appears in the same paper on the subject of the Kerensky interview. The Allies have only themselves to blame, for they have never displayed any anxiety to help Russia in her military and naval difficulties. On the other hand, immediately Italy is in difficulty, both France and Great Britain hasten to her assistance. &quot; Can it be.&quot; ends the paragraph, &quot; that one is a Revolutionary Republic and the other a Monarchy ?&quot;Though the representative journals write in this tone, it need not be concluded that the opinions expressed are typical of the working-classes among whom the journals circulate. Interest in the Russian Revolution appears to have waned rapidly, as the exceeding weakness of the Revolutionary authority became apparent. The sentimental appeals on the part of the Revolutionary Government were -not calculated to impress the British working man, and the virtual disappearance of the much-advertised British &quot;Soldiers&apos; and Workers&apos; Councils&quot; perhaps illustrates the decline of the excitement caused in Great Britain by the Revolution. That the influence of that Revolution was important in the early summer months cannot be gainsaid, but that influence has been modified by the hard facts of subsequent events.It would be a mistake to allow the very general charge of apathy on the part of the British Government to events in Russia, to pass unchallenged. The Revolutionary Government of Russia, as long as it maintained the authority essential to a Government, received the greatest consideration and unstinted assistance from Great Britain. It is desirable that this tact should be published in an authoritative manner, and in a form
which will ensure that it receives attention from those journals which have been most severe in their criticism. An official statement in the House of Commons would possibly prove the best and most straightforward method to counter the agitation on the subject in the Labour press.II.-Press Opinions.Criticism of the Government.The Labour press of the week is highly critical of various aspects of Governmental action and inaction. General criticism is most vehement in the columns of the &quot; Clarion&quot; and the &quot; Labour News.&quot;   The following extracts are taken from the formerpaper: &quot; No one in the Government appears to have a grip of the situation.   No one yetrealises what we are up against.....Who is responsible ? . . . . the failures andincompetents, the futilities and stupidities.   Well, who suffered them to delay and hinder &quot; and blunder ?   The man at the head, the Prime Minister, why should he escape in the general condemnation?&quot;The &quot;Labour News&quot; criticises specially the failure to pay an adequate wage to soldiers, the postponement of the Education Bill and the Ministry of Health, and the &quot; titanic food muddle,&quot; and considers that the only remedy is for democracy to take the power into its own hands.&quot; Boloism.&quot;The &quot; Herald&quot; prints as its main feature a very long article on &quot; The Bolo Touch in British Politics and Industry,&quot; referring specially to the sale of honours (a subject which is also criticised in a hostile spirit by the &quot; Labour Leader &quot; and the &quot;Call&quot;), and the activities of an obscure organisation known as I.P. It is suggested that this organisation is an association of employers banded together to defeat by underhand means the revolutionary spirit of labour, by employing the activities of associations such as the British Workers&apos; League and the Women&apos;s Social and Political Union. The article suggests that this demarche on the part of the employers is supported by the Government, and that the censorship in Labour news was removed in order to allow the movement full play.Opposition to Pacifist Propaganda.The &quot;Herald&quot; prints two articles, one protesting against the &quot;Hooligans of the Press,&quot; whose influence is used to prevent halls being hired for meetings which are believed to be pacifist in tone, the other &quot; Against the L.CO. Censor,&quot; quoting a statement issued by the &quot; Joint Committee of Protest against Prohibition of Sale of Literature in L.C.C. Parks and open spaces,&quot; and calling for funds to continue the loyal fight against the Council in this matter. The statement includes the allegation that &quot;this action of the Council is regarded in some quarters as only the prelude to a more daring attack on the right of public meeting.&quot;Government Control: Food.Although the Labour press is full of criticism, complaint, and suggestion on the subject of food supplies, prices, and control, it is notable that shortage of potatoes is mentioned, and that complaints are made as to the price of this commodity in the &quot; Call&quot; only. JThe &quot; Clarion &quot; in an article headed &quot; Food and Oratory,&quot; demands compulsory rationing.The &quot; Herald &quot; voices the same opinion : Although the card system put forward might restrict the use of certain essentials, it would leave the rich to make up with, what are known as luxuries. . . . . The diversity of income makes it possible for some classes to get more than they need, not of particular things but of food in general. We believe the&apos;proper thing to do is to share out all food-stuffs of every sort and kind-luxuries and everything else-and until this is done it is no use talking about the control of food.&quot;
&quot; Justice &quot; criticises the work of the Director of Food Economy, whom it terms &quot; as ignorant and incapable as the rest of the inexhaustible praters who have played the fool with our food.&quot;   It writes : -&apos;; Talk, talk, talk ! Lecture, lecture, lecture! Effective action is the last thing any of our paid servants think about. The situation is getting dangerous-very dangerous .... Down with the profiteers who have deliberately created famine, where there might have been plenty for all! Down also with the landlords, who have systematically opposed and laughed at any reasonable proposal for the cultivation of the land!   But that won&apos;tfeed us.....   Even now something could be done to save the situation, if we had anyman in authority who would take shipowners and landowners by the throat and UBe available labour on the land.&quot;The &quot; Leeds Citizen &quot; ridicules the &quot; League of National Safet3r &quot; inaugurated by Sir Arthur Yapp.The &quot; Call &quot; ends an article, &quot; Fooling with the Peoples Food,&quot; as follows : &quot; Even moderate men see the need for revolution now, but we do not desire a revolution brought about by hunger. The whole food supply of the nation should be taken over completely from its sources and administered on sound democratic lines.&quot;The prevalent shortage of tea, and, to a lesser extent, that of other com-modities, are in many quarters the subject of indictment of the Food Control Administration.Government Control: Coal.The &quot; Labour Leader&quot; prints an article on coal charges and indirect taxation, attacking both the increase in the price of coal, permitted as a sequence to the increased miners&apos; wages, and also the excess Profits Tax, which passes on to the consumer a burden which should fall on the shoulders of the capitalist mineowner. It alleges that &quot; the Government encouraged the increased prices in order that they might be in a position to secure revenue indirectly from the general public, whilst at the same time they were paying lip service to direct taxation of the profiteers.&quot;Pacifism.The &quot; Labour Leader &quot; has a bitter comment on the peace debate in the House of Commons.   It says : &quot;&apos;The Peace Debate&apos; in the House on Tuesday produced the worst exhibition of stubborn will to military conquest that our Government lias yet given to the world.Notwithstanding the great changes.....Mr. Balfour over and over again declaredthat we are still to stand by the whole of the ambitious war aims that were outlined in hiscovering note in answer to President Wilson.....What must be the thought by thedevoted leaders of the Russian Revolution who have consistently demanded a revision of these very war aims, when they read Mr. Balfour&apos;s words.&quot;The &quot; Times&quot; reports that the Merthyr Peace Council has now decided to initiate a stop-the-war policy. They have come to the conclusion &quot; that they must be out for peace and peace at any price.&quot;The &quot; Labour Leader &quot; denies the common charge that the &quot; down tools &quot; policy on the question of the comb-out is due to the I.L.P. and the U.D.C.The &quot;Leeds Citizen,&quot; the &quot;Call,&quot; and the &quot;South Wales Pioneer&quot; greet the movement in favour of releasing incarcerated conscientious objectors, which is supported by the &quot; Times &apos; as a return to sanity in respect of men in prison for conscience sake.The Comb-out Ballot.Remarks on the result of the comb-out ballot are absent from most of the Labour papers. The &quot; British Citizen and Empire Worker &quot; hails the result as a victory against the pacifist agitation, while &quot; Justice &quot; prints a colourless paragraph on the subject. The only I.L.P. journal which deals with the question at any length is the &quot; South Wales Pioneer,&quot; which conceals its mortification by insisting on the large number voting in the minority, deduces that -5 to 30 per cent, of the Welsh miners are wholehearted in their opposition to the war, and suggests that, the comb-out will result in a very large increase in the ranks ot the CO. This is doubtless the line which will be advocated by the pacifist journals.
III. District Reports.London and District.Aircraft workers continue to be restless, and a strike involving over 1,000 employees was in progress at Messrs. Napiers, at Acton, during the early part of last week, the men going back to work on the 8th.Apart from this, the cbief cause of unrest is the 12  per cent, increase, the position in regard to which has grown worse during the week.At Bedford a serious strike is in progress (see Section IV), and much discussion is going on in other parts, notably at Chatham and at Woolwich. A deputation was recently sent from Chatham to see Dr. Macnamara on the question.At Woolwich there are numerous other grievances. No improvement in the food situation is reported, and there is said to be discontent with the Committee on Production^ 5s. award. One of the most serious problems at Woolwich, and it is one which grows worse as winter becomes more pronounced, is that of the tramway service, which has long been notoriously inadequate. Delays of as long as an hour are by no means unknown, and the feeling of the men on the subject is said to be becoming dangt-rous.The London district executive of the Amalgamated Society of Engineers have decided to advise their members not to enrol under the Munitions Volunteers scheme, as they suspect the Government of playing a det-p game in this connection.Cases are now being reported in this area of employers refusing to take on men who cannot produce a written release from their last employer. Such cases are very welcome to the extremist agitators.Soutk-Western.The serious strike which is in progress at Cowes is described in Section IV. Ihere is also unrest in the Bristol district, where demarcation disputes have recently occurred.The narrow application of the 12^- per cent, increase is reported to be causing discontent, and the Electrical Trades Union at Bristol claims that its members should be included.West Midlands.This district is somewhat less restless.Discontent over the application of the 121- per cent, increase continues, but there has been a discontinuance of the complaints regarding secret action by the employers in regard to leaving certificates, since the issue of the press notice on the subject by the Ministry of Munitions.At Coventry the agitation about food prices continues, and a resolution demanding drastic action by the authorities was carried at a meeting of the Trades Council on the 8th.Yorkshire and East Midlands.There has been during the past week more unrest in this area, especially in the engineering industry, than for some months.   The chief cause has been the 121 per cent, increase, and the situation, particularly at Sheffield, is most acute.   On the 8th it was expected that all members of the Amalgamated Society of Engineers and Allied [1100-4] * qfhe Whitley Report.The letter of the Minister of Labour addressed to leading Trade Unions on the subject of the Industrial Councils is discussed by the &quot; Labour Leader &quot; and the &quot;Herald.&quot; The former paper joins issue with the suggestion contained in the letter that a settlement is desirable of the more permanent questions which have caused differences between employers and employed. The article suggests that experiments should first be tried on the Post Office, the Civil Service, and the railways, and denies that the more permanent questions are capable of solution by compromise or agreement. The &quot;Herald&quot; also recommends that action should first be taken in the case of the Post Office, the Civil Service, and the railways, all of which have voiced demands for joint control.
Trades would down tools on Monday (the 12th). There was some doubt as to the adherence of the Shop Stewards Committee, but this attitude seems to have been determined by the announcement in a Sheffield paper, it is not known with what authority, that the Government had decided to extend the increase to all grades. This would appear considerably to have relieved the situation, and the shop stewards are for the moment opposing drastic action. The Allied Trades have decided to hold a ballot on the question of supporting the labourers&apos; demands, and the labourers have decided to await the result of this ballot before taking action on their own account.Feeling at Leeds, Hudderstield, and Nottingham is reported to have been very high on the same subject.North- Western.The situation in regard to the l&apos;2\ per cent, increase is serious in this district also, and a series of small strikes are already in progress over questions connected with its application. At Liverpool, where the position is on the whole satisfactory, a certain amount of discontent is cxpiessed at the delay in putting the order into operation. The men have, however, been assured that the payment will be retrospective.There is much competition on the Mersey between the rival unions catering for clerks employed in the docks. The National Union of Clerks has recently been conducting a propaganda campaign in the district and the Mersey Ship Repairing Federation has assisted certain of the clerks to form a union of their own. There are rumours that certain employers are offering pecuniary inducements to those of their employees who will join the latter union. &apos;1 his looks suspiciously like a blackleg union and the National Amalgamated Union of Labour, which has so far enjoyed a fairly clear field in this district, is becoming irritated and angry.The discontent at Messrs. Brunner Mond&apos;s, at Northwich, has somewhat subsided. The trouble arises out of the smaller amount of overtime worked during the winter, but the firm has made a liberal offer which has been supported by arbitration. The mass of the workers are disposed to accept the award, but a number of firebrands are standing out against it.At Barrow the food and non-unionist questions are engaging the close attention of the shop stewards. Their deputation, which waited on the local Food Committee, met with a sympathethic reception, so that the stewards have decided to support any action which it may take.The Cotton Control Board came to several important decisions last week, the most important of which brings the system of levies on spinners and grants in aid of unemployment to an end.Northern.There has been a slight recrudescence of trouble in the shipyards and several small strikes have occurred. The discontent among the foremen employed by Messrs. Armstrong and Whitworth about the scantiness of their pay show signs of coming to a head. The miners in Durham are still discussing the question of an increase in the minimum wages. If their demands are not accepted they intend to ballot on the subject of handing in notices.Wales.The position in South Wales following the ballot on the comb-out question is much quieter, though disputes in the coal-fields are still frequent.The food scarcity is one of the chief subjects of discussion, and in certain districts the question is said to be acute.Scotland.The 12^-per cent, increase continues to be the burning question on the Clyde. Both masters and men are far from clear as to its application, and the former are for the time being withholding payment. There is a strong agitation for its application to all grades of workers, and the CW.C, which has recently obtained a considerable increase in membership, has thrown itself very eagerly into the struggle. There is also a strong tendency among the men engaged on piece and premium bonus work to transfer to time-work, as the advantages of the former systems are now almost imperceptible.
There is already a strike at Parkhead, and it is feared that this may spread to other shops.Ireland.Considerable unrest exists in the Belfast area over delay in the payment of the 12^ per cent, increase, and stoppages of work are threatened in numerous works.IV. Strikes.The most serious strike which has occurred during the week arose out of the increased coal prices in the Isle of Wight. The price of coal at Cowes is no less than 3s. 2d. per cwt., and this has caused very acute discontent. Eventually the Allied Trades and Labour Council passed a resolution calling upon all trades in the port of Cowes to down tools at midday on Saturday, the 10th November. A ballot was held on this resolution, which received the support of a ten-to-one majority. On that day some 7,000 men left work, but beyond the fact that the trouble may spread to the railway system on the island, no further information has yet been received.No really important strikes have yet occurred in connection with the 12  per cent, increase to skilled men, but several minor cases have been reported, and more serious trouble has with difficulty been averted. Eight cases of strike have been reported by the Ministry of Munitions as being in progress in and around Manchester over this increase. All the members of the Workers&apos; Union employed by two important firms of agricultural implement makers at Bedford, moulders of hobnails for military boots at Leeds, and fitters and smiths at Chepstow have come out during the past week in connection with this question, and it is now reported that a stay-in strike of the men employed in the howitzer shop at Parkhead commenced on Monday last.In the Coal Mining Industry there have been nineteen strikes in progress of which seven have been settled, and six have commenced during the Aveek.In two of these cases only, namely, those at Sutton-in-Ashfield (Nottingham), which threatens to spread, and Treherbert (South Wales), are considerable bodies of men involved. The bitter and protracted strike at the Llandebie Colliery in Glamorgan has come to an end, following the refusal of the conference of delegates from the anthracite mines, which met in Swansea on Saturday, to support the cause.The strike of turners and fitters in the L.S.W. Railway Company&apos;s shops at Eaetleigh continues, but no further extension has taken place, and an early resumption on the part of the men who are out is expected.Arising out of the serious demarcation dispute between engineers and boilermakers in South Wales the men at Port Talbot and Swansea remained on strike throughout last week. An arbitration is now being arranged, and the men at all ports are believed to be back at work.A strike of leather workers at Runcorn over the recognition of the union which involved some 500 men employed on army contract work came to an end on the 6th on the firnVs agreeing to recognise the union.In addition to the strikes occurring owing to the application of the 1.2^ per cent, increase, the Ministry of Munitions reports fourteen cases of strikes, twelve of which nave been settled. The causes given are various, but include demarcation, dilution, dismissal of employees, victimisation, and the stoppage of work on Sunday. The last case is interesting, showing how little many of the workers realise their own interests. It is paralelled by other cases of dispute, in which there have been threats of strike owing to a decrease in overtime due to the introduction of dilution.Y. Disputes.I he number of cases reported by the Shipyard Labour Department shows an increase of 24 over last week&apos;s figure, standing at 191. In 5o of these cases a settlement has been effected, but in 19 of them stoppages^ work have occurred.Ihese increased figures appear to be largely due to a slight recrudescence of unrest on the Clyde and the North-East Coast. No settlement has yet been obtained either in the case of the Clyde rivetters, who are much concerned at the continued delay which has occurred m drawing up their price lists for standard and merchant vessels, or in that of the plumbers where the application of an award is in question.   Rivetting rates for
trawlers and fishing vessels are also causing trouble at Aberdeen, and a strike, which may yet occur, has been with difficulty avoided.Jealousy between shipwrights and joiners appears to be increasing; this week&apos;s demarcation disputes between them are reported from the Clyde and Newcastle. A similar case between electricians and boilermakers is reported from the Mersey.The Coal Controller reports seven cases of dispute in which a stoppage of work has so far been avoided ; in one of these cases a settlement has been obtained.The protracted dispute between the Owners and Colliery Examiners and Firemen in South Wales, which recently led to a very serious strike, has at last been settled. The owners have now agreed considerably to modify the reservations under which they were prepared to recognise the Union, and which the men claimed took away the whole value of such recognition.The Scottish Shale Workers, who are claiming the increase recently granted to coal workers, have not yet been able to obtain a settlement, and are threatening to strike.   It is hoped, however, that the affair will soon be satisfactorily arranged.The War Office Contracts Department has only one new case of dispute to report, and of the five cases previously reported two have been settled. The most important of these latter was that arising out of the attitude of the Scottish Council of Textile Workers in demanding that an application for increased wages on non-munition work shall be heard by the Committee on Production. After holding out for some weeks the Council has abandoned its obstructive attitude, and the legitimate applications have been heard by the Committee on Production.A serious dispute has arisen in the Scottish leather industry, owing to the action of the United Society of Journeymen Curriers, who have put forward an entirely new price list demanding a &quot;25 per cent, increase on the scale of prices fixed in April last and the inclusion of work not previously undertaken. The men are out of hand, and the Union has had much difficulty in preventing their stopping work. The employers refuse to accede to this demand, but are prepared to consider an all-round increase on the previous award.The position in the Cutlery Trade still gives ground for anxiety, owin^ to the action of certain&quot; employers who have refused to accept an arrangement between the Master Cutlers&apos; Association and the National Amalgamated Union of Labour authorising a la per cent, increase in wages.Unrest in the Clothing Trade continues.The Ministry of-Munitions has but nine cases of dispute to report, three of which have been settled. Four cases have arisen out of allegations of victimisation. In three of these cases the charge has already been proved to be groundless; the other case has not yet been investigated. The high proportion of these cases in which the charges are found on examination to he without foundation has heen referred to on previous occasions in this report.   The present tendency is to regard any case of dismissal as victimisation.A somewhat serious case of restriction of output is reported from one of Messrs. Beardmore&apos;s factories at Glasgow. The night-shift workers, of whom only 50 per cent, are unionists (National Federation ol Women VVorkers) produce 24 per cent, more shells than the day shift, all of whom are members of the union. Three of the women, whose restriction of output was particularly noticeable, were given notice to leave, and a considerable number of the others have now handed in their notices. The union apparently admits the policy of restriction.Trouble is reported from Leeds, where for some time the aircraft workers have held out against an award bringing the industry under the rules of the engineering trade. A strike which would have involved 850 workers was threatened, but an agreement has now been reached.The Committee on Production heard sixteen cases in London last week and nine in Scotland. In addition, they dealt with forty-five of the cases brought forward for special consideration in connection with the recent application for a general increase in wages in connection witii the recent general ciaim in the engineering industry, which brings the total advance to 20s. per week in the engineering trades, or, in the case of many of the unskilled workers, an advance of 80 per cent, since the war. The most important of the other ca es had to do with an application put forward by the locomotive enginemen and firemen for increased wages and certain alterations in conditions of service. This claim involves the consideration of the industrial truce of 1914, and also the relations of the demandant union with the National Union of Ilailwaymen. The hearing of this very important case is not yet concluded.I). J. SHACKLETON.o
