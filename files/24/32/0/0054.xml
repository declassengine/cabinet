One of the immediate results of the Italian disaster is that six French and four British divisions are now either in or on their way to Italy from the Western front.   It is probable that these will be followed by two more British divisions, making 12 Allied divisions.     The Italians asked us at Rapallo for 15 divisions, and since then have asked for 20.Before the Italian collapse the French calculated that they would have to reduce their Armies in France by eight, divisions during the coming Winter.   To supply drafts for Italy they have already had to reduce one division earlier than was anticipated, and the total reduction of force may well amount to as much as 12 divisions.   We must therefore be prepared to find that in the Spring the Franco-British forces in France are from 24 to 30 divisions weaker than they were in October.   At the same time, in view of the Russian situation, we must be prepared to find that by next Spring the German forces on the Western front will be increased by as many as 30 divisions.     This may therefore mean an alteration in the balance of strength on the Western front in favour cf the enemy of as much as 60 divisions.    It is therefore a matter of the greatest urgency that America should make every possible effort to compensate England and France for the burden of supporting Italy which has fallen upon them.     This is the form of American assistance which at the present time is of the greatest value and of the greatest urgency, and nothing should be allowed to interfere with it.

2,   Any further assistance which.-America^can-give -would,/ be of most value to the Alliance in keeping Russia in the field.   The political situation in Russia at the present time is so uncertain that it is impossible to say Whether any help is feasible or can be effective, but if help is possible then the most effective form it could take is the re-organization and restoration of the transportation facilities of Russia, in order that the resources of the country, which are at the present time paralyzed owing to the failure of distribution, msy be utilized and both Armies and people may be fed and provided with their essential requirements.Further than this, if shipping can be made available in the Pacific without reducing the tonnage available for transporting American troops and stores to Frcnce, then it is worth considering whether some of the enormous resources in man-power of the &quot;United States mitht not bo utilised in sending a body of troops to Russia, &quot;/here their presence might have a steadying effect on the political situation, and provide a nucleus round which the best elements in the countrv would rallv.It would also assist us greatly if America could help in creating an Armenian Army on the Caucasian front. A communication on the subject was sent by the Foreign Office t.o the American Government some time ago, but no reply has yet been received.       If Russia collapses and the Armenians are left to themselves, they will be at the mercy cf the Turks and we may expect.massacres worse than any which have taken place in the past.    On the other hand,  the Armenians are good soldiers&apos;,  they know that their lives are at stake, and they are quite prepared to fight the Turks if they are given the necessary assistance.A solid and well equipped Armenian and Georgianforce

Another important field in which America can assist the Alliance is in aiding the re-constitution of the Greek Army.   England and France have agreed to supply the Greeks with the equipment they require for this purpose, but Greeco is also in urgent need of money and her people are on the- vergo of starvation.   Without mor^y and food Greece cannot be expected to como whole-heartedly into the war. She has a considerable potential foroe which may amount to as much as nine divisions, and if an army of this size can be equipped and placed in the field, it will relieve very materially the efforts of England and France upon whom at present the chief burden of maintaining the Allied front in the Balkans has fallen.4*      America might give us important assistance in providing labour, particularly brick-layers and carpenters who are urgently needed to the extent of some 20,00u to 30,000 to hasten the erection of aerodromes, aircraft factories, and other constructional work of direct and immediate Importance for the conduct of the war,Any and every assistance America can give us in the way of increasing the Allied air forces ia of the utmost importance.
