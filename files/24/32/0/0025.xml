85- ^s^nAP hoped that this question might have been settled in conference between the Ministry of National Service, the War Office, and the Ministry of Munitions.Tt is to be observed that if this method of relieving emergency conges-tion at the docks, at the steel works, and on the railways is vetoed, the responsibility for supplying an alternative labour force must rest with the Ministry of National Service. Failing this, serious contractions in the delivery of military material are inevitable, and estimates must be revised accordingly.WINSTON S. CHURCHILL.November 3, 1917.[1140-1]
[This Dooiuaenfc is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s GoveiCONFIDENTIAL,MILITARY LABOURMemorandum prepared for the Minister of Muni-tions by Sir Charles Ellis, Sir Ernest Moir Colonel Hawkins (op the Transport Workers&apos; Battalion), and concurred in by Sir Norman Hill.1. Sir Auckland Geddess general contention in his Memorandum of the 29th October, N.S. Rl8, that there are objections in principle to the employment of mixed military and civilian labour is accepted ; but a balance must be struck between theoretical principles and the practical necessities of the war, and the Ministry of Munitions urge that Sir Auckland Geddes&apos;s principle ought not to debar the full utilisation with proper safeguards of (a.) The Transport Workers&apos; Battalion. (/;.) Military working parties.2. As to the Transport Workers&apos; Baftalion, it is im-possible for the Ministry of Munitions to rate too highly the value of their work and the absolute necessity of its continuance.    The means of transport are limited and severely strained.   It is obviously essential that both ships and railway waggons should be unloaded with the greatest possible  rapidity, and the  resources of civilian labour are inadequate for the purpose.   What is needed is a mobile body of men accustomed to working together in gangs, which can be called on at very short notice to deal with the sudden rushes of traffic both at the docks and on railways, winch are created at all times by the arrival of ships in harbour and are greatly inten-sitied by the convoy system.   The Transport Workers&apos; Battalion exactly meets this need.   It should be observed that: (a.) The men form part of the Home Defence forces; it is contended that their military discipline and their availability at short notice for pur-poses of defence are not materially impaired by their utilisation for civil purposes.(6.) There is no other reserved pool of organised and mobile labour which can be drawn upon for the purpose.(c.) It is an essential condition that the Battalion should not be utilised unless there is a shortage of civil labour, verified by a local committee, upon which organised labour is represented.id.) The men in the Battalion have either volunteered for service there, or if transferred compulsorily they have had an opportunity of volunteering tor transfer to an ordinary Home Defence unit.(t\) While engaged on civilian work they are paid at the port or district rate.
(/.) The necessity for them is proved by the work which they have done. The number of days&apos; work done has increased from 57,500 days in January to 185,400 in August. In September it was 173,700, and the aggregate for the first nine months of 1917 was 1,189,000 days. In the iron ore ports the rate of dis-charge has this year been increased from about 500 tons per day to over 1,000 tons per day.(g.) There may have been protests in one or two cases from Trade Unions, and there may have been one or two cases presumably quite excep-tional, such as that cited by Sir Auckland Geddes, where a man was called up and returned in ten days to his work as a soldier, but in general the scheme has worked with a conspicuous lack of friction with organised civilian labour.(h.) If it is considered necessary for military reasons to preserve a large army for Home Defence, which must, in the nature of tilings be idle for a large part of its time, it is difficult to see what better means can be devised for utilising this reserve of labour. If it is proposed to transfer to Army Reserve the men now forming the Transport Workers&apos; Battalion, their peculiar utility will disappear, for it is essential that they should be mobiie, disciplined, accustomed to working together, and quickly available.In these circumstances the Ministry of Munitions would regard any proposal to discontinue the Transport Workers&apos; Battalion as a calamity ; in particular, it would directly and immediately reduce the output of steel.3. Military Working Parties. It is true that there have been cases in the past where the employment of military working parties has led to Libour trouble ; on the other hand, emergencies do and must arise which cannot be met satisfactorily by any other expedient yet devised.    For  instance,   a  sudden   need   arose   for moving immediately certain large stores of explosives, the   accumulation   of   which    had  suddenly become dangerous.     It    was    not    possible   to   collect    at twelve i hours&apos;    notice   adequate   gangs   of   civilian labour.   Again, at a large munition store the collection and disposal of the heavy munitions dealt with fell badly in arrears, owing to the shortage of civil labour, and finally reached   such a point that large numbers of waggons were idle, the railway was seriously conjested, and the munitions works which the store supplies were held up for want of materials, which there was no labour to move.   The dislocation was only temporary, and one which could be easily overcome by the employment for a short period of a military working party.   Again, the Shefiield United Gas Works, on which many of the most essential  munition  works   in   Sheffield  are  entirely dependent for the supply of heat, light, and power, was only kept going last winter by means of a military working party.   This was a case where civilian labour was not willing to undertake the arduous and unpleasant work involved, and it was only military discipline which made it possible to retain the necessary complement of
labour on the spot. The same situation has again arisen at Sheffield. This is no doubt precisely the use of military discipline to which in general Sir Auckland Geddes objects, but there are exceptional cases where, when all other devices have failed, we should be wasting the resources which we possess if we made a theoretically sound principle absolute in its application. It is urged therefore that the employment of military working parties should not be debarred as a temporary expedient in exceptional cases approved by the Ministry of National Service, where it has not been found possible to obtain civilian labour. One weighty consideration must always be the susceptibility of Trade Unions on the employment of military labour in any way that would compete with civilian labour, or interfere with the customary standards of pay and conditions of service.November 3, 1917.PRINTED AT THE FOREIGN OFFICE BY C. K. HARRISON. 5/11/1917.
