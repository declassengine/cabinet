From:- Caucasus Military Agent. To:-      D.M.I.Lnc i I ops I Ey O]Tiflis November 17th 1917.59.Regarding formation of national troops in Caucasus.   I understand General Niessel (French Mission Russia) has promised Colonel Torkom (Armenian officer with French Military training) 40 French officers for 2 Armenian divisions,     Torkom has a schfeme of organisation ready and is in close touch with Andronik (local Armenian military leader).     Have you made any similar offor of British officers ?     Should like to knov &quot;rtiat line of action allied governments have decided upon and whether they are pressing for earliest possible formation, and for real assistance from Russians in matters concerning equipment and supply..    Attitude of military High Commissioner here and Commander in Chief Caucasus front though outwardly favourable is antagonistic in reality, same applies to subordinate Russian officers, nothing really doing.     Georgian formation not even begun; Armenians hare a military committee but Georgians and Russians jealous of any progress on part of Armenians\C.2.
