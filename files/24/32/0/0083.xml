fhe-following telegrams, which, were delayed in transmission have been received from the Military Attache&quot;, Petrograd.IHo. 1489, dated 11th November, 191?.Situation is worse than yesterday.   As far as is known the relief force.of Cpssacke have not advanced.     This is thought to be owing to Kerenskl&apos;3 desire to&apos;avoid bloodshed and it is probably discouraging the Cossacks &quot;as it if certainly encouraging the rebels.     Prom the point of view of war it seems &quot;to make little difference whether moderate socialists or extreme socialists win and there seems little chance of any one with common sense getting in.it is reported that the rprthern front is starving.Ho, 149G, dated 12th November, 1917.Artillery Officer who left Riga front .3 days ago reports hie arm ic now as bad as infantry.     They dispersed to loot when leaving Riga and he brought away his guns with the heip of ZO Lett girls as drivers.     The gunners threw out shell to make room for loot.     Army at front sympathises generally with rebels and there is no chance of their conoentin3 to suppreoolon of rising, except at promise of loot of Capital.Cossacks are the only disciplined fproe in the country and they have it in their power tt reduce north to reaoon in a fortnight by withholding supplies of coal, corn and oil.i&apos;o. 1494, dared 17th November, 1917,Two regiments, the o Pqreo&apos;^ra,1 eneki and oVolinski have returned from the ietrograd* front, refusing to take any further pf^rt in the civil war.     It is stated that the Cossacks with herenaki have said that they are tired of doing police work. Cossacks have restored order in ;&apos;.iev.   In losoow situation is still doubtful in spite of great bloodshed.In Petrpgrp4 Bolsheviks are still supreme, but arc learning that they cannot govern owing to strike of all employes in ministries.     There will be probably little further fighting, but much talk before a coalition socialist government is &quot;formed.Prom the allied point of view, the complexion of this government is of little interest for neither socialist wing has any knowledge cf affairs or desire to fight.horoilov has not escaped,   Savinkov has left liereneki and is at Liev. General iiessel returned from northern Front and first armies to-day.    He characterizes the state of these armies as disgusting.e Regiments of Poot Guardo.* Tcarskoe Selo 10 miles south of Petrograd and Gatchina 20 milee 8.S.\7. of Petrograd.
