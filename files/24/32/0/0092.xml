His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.)I de3ire to draw attention to the very seriousCOTTON SITUATION.situation in Lancashire which is likely to arise shortly as the result of the difficulty in securing sufficient ship-ments of cotton from America.    It is probable that the American cotton crop will not turn out quite so well as was expected, while the American war demand may absorb a large part of the crop, and there may therefore in any case be some difficulty in securing the full amount of American cotton which the Lancashire trade requires.    The main difficulty, however, which has to be faced, is the difficulty of securing adequate tonnage space for the cotton, and so far as can be foreseen it is rather a shortage of space tnan any actual shortage in cotton for shipment which will be the dominant feature in the situation.The Cotton Control Beard which was appointed last June to control the distribution of available supplies of cotton came to the conclusion in July that it was absolutely essential to restrict the existing amount of cotton machinery that could be worked having regard to the fig-ares of soocks which were in their possession and to the prospects then before them of further supplies.    On August 9th an Order was made by the Board of Trade empowering the Control Board to limit the number or percentage of spindles or looms that migit be worked in cotton mills and weaving shed3, and on August 22nd the Cotton Control Board issued instructions under this Order, copy of whi-. h is appended.    Under theseinstructions
instructions the amount of machinery that could be worked was limited to sixty per cent, of the machinery at the mill except under licence.     Provision was,however, made for the grant of licences to work excess machinery on the payment of levies, the funds arising from these levies being uaod for the relief of operatives temporarily discharged as the result of the restriction.      The scheme came into operation on September 10th and was to remain in operation for 13 weeks.    The period of operation of the scheme is therefore now drawing to a close.Employers in the cotton trad a were only induced to pay the levies provided for under the scheme on the clear understanding that the notices for increases of wages which had then been given by the operatives would be withdrawn. The levies have yielded a substantial fund which has enabled the Control Board to pay to all male adult opera-tiv&amp;a thrown out of employment 25/- per week with an extra 1/- for each child unemployed;   to all women operatives 15/-per W9ek with an addition of 1/- for each child unemployed, and to boy8 thrown out of work 12/- per week.      It is now generally admitted that the operatives will insist at the end of the 13 weeks period, on a substantial rise in wageB and it is not disputed by the employers1 representatives on the Control Board that they have good grounds for such increase in wages;   but it is also evident that it will not be possible for the employers to pay the increased wages and also to continue to pay the levies provided fcy the existing scheme.But
But this is by no means the whole trouble.   It appears exceedingly difficult, if not impossible, to maintain suffi-eient imports of cotton to enable the mills to continue working even to the reduced extent now permitted.    The Control Board have taken a recent Census of Stocks of cotton which show that the total stocks of American cotton available in the United Kingdom amount to 370,000 bales in addition to which 202,000 bales are at sea.    The Shipping Controller has stated that he cannot see his way to provide space for the shipment of more than 25,000 bales of American cotton per week in November, whilst as regards December no more than 40,000 can be promised.    Even if 260,000    bales are shipped in November and December and arrive therefore before the end of January it appears that the total amount of American cotton which can be counted on for use up to the end of January is only 823,000 bales.The recent weekly consumption of American Cotton has been 55,000 bales.    By insisting that no mill should work more than 60% of its machinery on American Cotton a saving of 5,000 bales per week ia now being effected but this involves of course complete cessation of all levies on employers in the American Section of the industry.Having regard to the necessity of maintaining some stock in Lancashire the Control Board advice that unless shipments can be materially increased the amount of machin-ery employed must be at once dropped to 50%, which would mean a consumption of 42,000 bales.    Some idea of the amount of unemployment that will result can be derived from thefollowing
following figures.    There are stated tc he about 350,000persons affected directly by the Cotton Control Board scheme.Of these 30,000 on the average are at present unemployed endare being paid out of the levies which are above referred to.If production is reduced to 50ft these 30,000 will becomeconsiderably more than 100,000 and the only funds availablefor unemployed benefit will be those of the trade Unions.In order to reduce the monthly consumption of cotton to thatwhich is being shipped in November,viz., 100,000 bales, only30&amp; of the spindle8 could be ollo^ed to work and the numbersunemployed would swell to much greater dimensions.    Theordinary Trade Union benefit for adult males is only 12/-^per week for card room workers and 10/- per v/eek for spinners,Women being paid 8/- per week and 6/- per week respectively.In the case of the weavers many even of the Trade Unionmembers will not be entitled under their rules to any benefitwhatever.    Moreover the Trade Union benefits of course applyonly to members of the Unions and there is no provision atall for the support of non-members.    It is not necessary tolabourthe point that with the present level of food pricesTrade Union benefits, 3uch as they are, are wholly inadequate theto keep^peratives alive.    Moreover, apart from the rules framed by the Unions which limit the period during which benefits are paid to a few months,, the funds themselves are limited and could not continue to be distributed indefinitely.It is also to be borne in mind that we have to consider not only those directly affected by the shortage of cotton, i.e. spinnerB and weavers  but also the large number ofpersons
Y\persons engaged in ancillary trades such as printers, ^bleachers, dyers,doublers, lace and hosiery makers etc.   These trades do not share in the products of the existing levies, but it is quite clear that they will have to be borne in mind in any general scheme for relief which may become necessary as a result of the existing and prospective shortage of - cotton.In all the circumstances it appears to me to be a matter of extreme urgency to consider whether, in the first place, it is not possible to provide for considerably larger imports of cotton than the Shipping Controller is at present -prepared to allow for, and in the second place, to consider how the State can best come to the assistance of Lancashire and enable the population to tide over the very serious distress which in any event seems likely to be inevitable early next year1.      I therefore suggest that the whole problem should te considered at an early date.A.H. STAKLE2T., 20th November,1917.

IHSTHDOTIDSS-ISSUErLBr &quot;THL .OOTTON&apos; COl^TBDL- BOSHD -JUSSUANT TO THE COTTON (SI^TEIOTION OP OUTPUT) CRDI8, 1917.1,       Subject to the provisions of paragraph 7 hereof, cn and after the 3rd September 1917 x no person shall work or allow to be worked in any cotton or cotton waste mill occupied by him, more than 60 per cent of the total number of mule and/or ring spindles, and necessary preparatory machinery, contained therein witb-out a licence from the Cotton Control Board. 2.       Licences may be granted by the Cotton Control Board to spinners of; Egyptian and Sea Island Cotton and to spinners of cotton waste to work more than 60 per cent of the total number of mule and/or ring spindles and necessary preparatory machinery in any mill during such time as may be prescribed by the licence, on pay-men t of -l d per mule spindle per week, and1-g-d   &quot;  ring spindle per week on all spindles worked above 60 per cent of the,total number. EXAMPLE :-A Mule spinning mill containing 100,000 spindles, 60,000 spindles may be worked without any payment.63,000 nay be worked on payment of a weekly levy of l^d. per spindle on the extra 3,000 spindles,and, so on.3.        Licences may be granted by the Cotton ControlBoard to spinners of American and all growths of cotton,other than Egyptian and Sea Island, to \7ork up to 70 percent of their total number of mule and/or ring spirdJc;______________ dur ing
during such time as may be prescribed by the licence on payment of ltd. per arule spindle, and ljd. per ring spindle per week or. the spindles in excess of 60 per cent, of the total spindles in the mill.   Provided that where a spinner of any each cotton proves to the satisfaction of the Board that he is engaged on a Government contract or contracts, a licence to work spindles in excess of 70 per cent, may be granted, on payment of the weekly levies mentioned in the last paragraph. 4.    where a mill contains both ring and mule spindles the occupier shall before the 3rd day of September, 1917 apply to the Cotton Control Board for directions as to the proportion of ring and mule spindles respectively that may be worked, and the Board shall give such dir-ections as they think fit, provided that they shall allow 60 per cent, of the total of such spindles to be worked. 5.      Subiect to the provisions of paragraph 7  hereof, cn and after the 3rd September, 1917, no person shall work cr allow to be worked more than 60 per cent, of the total number of looms in any weaving shed occupied by him, with-out a licence from the Gotton Control Board, provided that any beams actually in looms at the date of these instructions may be woven out within four weeks of the date hereof.A manufacturer has 100 looms ALfc working.   He may on and after September 3rd run 60 looms without payment of levy, and is allowed four weeks from August 22nd in which to weave out the remaining 40 looms.   Should he intend, however, to keep running, say, 80 looms, he must declare this number now, and pay the levy, as shown in Clause 6, on the extra 20 looms from September 3rd, the remaining 20 looms being allowed four weeks from August 22nd in which to weave out.(2)
