Artillery emplacements are nearly complete and the total guns reported available is 3600.     Considerable number of machine guns have been supplied, 50 new companies to the 3rd Army alone.     Authorities have placed a good deal of civilian labour at the disposal of Army for construction of successive lines of defence
on Grappa^on the ridge from Asclo to Bassano on a line connecting the entrenchment camp Treviso with Gittadella Castelfranco and Vicenza for the works of the Bacchiglione positions extending fromVicenza to Padua.Wire entanglements and trenches along the 3rd Army front are now in a fairly complete state.    Troops are in very good spirits and appear to be rested and well fed.    Each brigade has now one regiment in front of line and the other in reserve,   Commanders and troops appear confident of holding line,In the .4th Army considerable progress has been made inputting the Grappa and Tomba positions in state of defence.Wire entanglements have been made and the trenches are being made with all possible speed.   Troops have tents and fur sleeping bags and the supply services seem to be working well.   Commanders and troops seem confident on this sector also.    There is less snow on Grappa and the road from Bassano to the summit has been considerably improved.   On the 1st Army front conditions appear to be satisfactory.    Italian troops still hold their main line of defence intact and are confident of maintaining their ground.6th Army Corps has now been reformed and Is being moved up in reserve of the 4th Army.    It is hoped that in a few days the four Army Corps now forming the 2nd Army will be reformed. Considerable number of drafts of the 1899 Class have been sent up and are reported to be doing very well.leather is fine and has facilitated the work of Italian troops and helped to improve their moral.    There is evidence of the enemy having much difficulty with the transport of his heavy guns, stores and ammunition and the delay is all in favour of Italians,
