I )        &apos; A O OAny further communication on this subject should be addressed to The Secretary,Ministry of Shipping,St. James&apos;s Park,London, S.W. 1, and the following number quoted.MINISTRY OF SHIPPING,17th November, 1917Sir,llh ,V xn continuation of my letter of the 10thSECRETARY *R CABINETInstant, I am directed by the Shipping Controller to report, for the information of the War Cabinet, as follows:-1. CONVOYS(a)     Homeward bound Convoys      Since the date of the last report 9 convoys, consisting of 118 ships (918,800 tons deadweight) have arrived.       There were no casualties either by enemy action or marine peril, but the Danish vessel &quot;KAI&quot; reported    having sailed in the S/S &quot;TANTA&quot; convoy from Gibraltar parted company very soon after sailing and was boarded and sunk by enemy submarine North sest of Cape Sparta.     There are now 14 convoys on passage home, consisting of 227 ships (1,632,800 tons deadweight)(b)     Outward bound convoys     Since the last report 9 convoys, consisting of 120 ships (879,100 tons deadweight) have been escorted through the danger zone. There was one casualty by enemy action, namely S/S &quot;ARDGLAMIS&quot; sunk by torpedo about 200 miles \7est of Gibraltar.     There were no casualties by marine peril. There are now   in the danger zone 6 convoys of 62 ships. A statement is enclosed showing the number of convoys, steamers and tonnage convoyed to 10th November 1917.
A statement is also enclosed showing the casualties which occurred to steamers homeward bound from the North Atlantic carrying Wheat and sugar.FINANCEDuring the week ended the 10th instant the sum of  579,500 was paid for compensation in cases of total loss on requisitioned ships, making a total of  29^540,718 paid on this account since the 1st April 1917, INCREASED CULTIVATION IN IRELAND,SAVING IN COASTING TONNAGEA statement is also enclosed showing the estimated total production of wheat, oatSj barley, rye and potatoes in Ireland,     It will be seen that the actual increase in these commodities is 2,254,875 tons over the year 1916, or 1,475,656 tons over the annual average from 1912 to 1916.     At the moment it is of course impossible to say what proportion of this output would be exported asj.a good deal depends upon what is   , decided with respect to the import of flour, etc. into Ireland...     It may be that such flour will be available for use in Ireland and if so, the Irish oat crop or part of it, will be substituted.     It is estimated that the surplus potato output will be all exported.     This amounts to 1,750,654 over the 1916 supply, or 1,008,953 tons over the average 1912 to 1916.. Mr. Burgess Director of Cross Channel Transportation is responsible under the direction of the Home Trade Branch of the Ministry for the arrangements for conveyance of the surplus produce.ROYAL VISIT
honoured this Department by visiting the office.     Her Majesty who was accompanied by His Royal Highness, Prince Albert was received by the Controller, the members of the Shipping Control Committee, and the principal officials of the Department, and was conducted round the office.NEUTRAL TONNAGEA memorandum explaining the present position with regard to neutral tonnage is enclosed for the infor-mation of the War Cabinet.MILITARY TRANSPORTOwing to congestion on the railways in Prance and Italy, it has been necessiary to put store ships on service from United Kingdom to Genoa, and from Cette to Genoa, in order to maintain the Armies based on ArquataTo relieve the Italian supply position arrangements are being made to send to Italy oats consigned to the British Army in Prance, and replace them by shipments from the United Kingdom.NEUTRAL TONNAGE REQUISITIONEDDuring the last week the Norwegian steamers &quot;HESTMANDEN&quot; and &quot;ALBRi?. SELMER&quot; were requisitioned, and the b/ s &quot;ATLAS&quot;-was torpedoed and sunkKjBK TONNAGEThe s/s &quot;WAR PILOT&quot; built in Japan was delivered at Kobe on the 7th instant.
5 28rk i&apos;j 0*9. CARRIAGE OF FUEL OIL IN DOUBLE BOTTOM?OF LINSRS AND CARGO STEAMERS.In June last in consequence of the very serious situation of the Naval stocks of Fuel Oil in this Country, and the improbability of this situation being promptly relieved by United States assistance in Tank Steamers, the War Cabinet authorised the carriage of Fuel Oil in the Ballast Tanks of Liners and Cargo Steamers, even though this shut out other urgently needed cargo *The following particulars of the development of the above system of importing Fuel Oil are submitted;-1.    No of ships fitted(a) in U.r\A. 205^(b) in U.K. 2382.    No. of ships fitting 273.    Average delay to each ship days4.    No. of tons Oil loaded inU.?.A.to 9/11/17 320,593-do-        lost    &quot; 4,550-do- Arrived in XJ.Z.to 9/11/17 243,519-do-        Afloat 72,5245,    No. of Tankers needed to deliverthis quantity in same period 15iihile it should be borne in mind that the carriage of Fuel Oil in Double Bottoms excludes an equal quantity of weight cargo, such as Wheat and Munitions, and should therefore be discontinued as soon as the stock situation improves, it will be a great advantage in the future to have these fitted Liners and Cargo Steamers ready to carry Oil in times cf emergency.
The total amount of coal shipped to Italy from the United kingdom by all steamers (British, Allied and Neutral) during the month of October was   541,000 tons.     This is practically the same as was shipped in September.    399,000 tons of this were in British ships or just three quarters of the whole.To this must be added about 25,000 tons shipped fromAmerica.11. COAL FOB AMERICAN FORGES IN FRANCE.For the present, and until the United States can get their own shins into the service, British tonnage is being.put at their disposal to carry to France the coal required for the United States Forces.    The Americans have given an undertaking to repay for this service by shi ping later a similar amount for us to France.12. TRANSPORT OF RATINGS.1,500 Ratings have been sent to the Mediterranean to join His Majesty&apos;s Ships this week - proceeding overland to Marseilles, thence by transport.
13. VESSELS iaJM IN THC BALTIC,The removal of British and allied vessels from the Baltic, under the agreement rath the Swedish Government regarding the Kogrund passage, has been-steadily proceeding durin/r the Summer and Autumn.       Up to the present 46 British and allied vessels with a total gross tonnage of 116,656 have been brought safely to this country, and four with a total tonnage of 7520 have been lost or captured en route.11 British and allied ships are engaged on Russian services in the Baltic j. and 5 others, which have also been so engaged during the Summer, have been released by the Russian Government for removal.       Of these 3, with a total tonnage of 5,700 have just arrived safely in Swedish waters.Negotiations have also been in progress for the removal of 8 large Russian vessels, which are too large for convenient use in the Baltic, but would b6 of great value for Russian or other services outside.The importance of freeing these vessels has been &apos; vigourously impressed upon the Russian Government, and represent ations have also been made through the Russian Government Committee in London.       The last report from retrograd on the subject stated that every effort was feeing made at that end, and there appeared to be good prospect of removing some at least of the ships.It is not, however, at present known how far recent events in Russia may have interfered with this.I am, Sir,Your obedient Servant, (Sg&amp;.)

VERY ROUGH PRELIMINARY ESTIMATE S.
MINISTRY    OF    SHIPPING MElCSuANlOLM ON TB3 CONTHOL OF NEUTRAL  TONNAGEDuring the first two years of the war the power whioh Great Britain possessed owing to its control over a great part of the bunker depots of the world was effectively used not only to prevent neutral shipping rendering direct or indirect service to the enemy but also to secure that the neutral shipowner gave a reasonable return to the Allies for the facilities which he enjoyed,The great increase in the war risks to which the neutral ship was exposed towards the end of 1916 resulted in a very great raduction in the effectiveness of the bunker weapon.    A state of affairs was created in which the possibility of his whole fleet being immobilised lost its terror for the neutral owner who was quite ready to sacrifice immediate financial gain in order to keep his ships safe and ready for post-war trading.Tt therefore became necessary to supplement bunker control by direct political and economic pressure on the principal maritime neutral countries and during the present year every effort has been made by His Majesty&apos;s Government to arrive at general tonnage agreements which shall secure as much neutral tonnage as possible for direct or indirect allied war services, Norway is of course by far the most important of these countries in that she possesses a mercantile marine far in excess of what she needs for her own imports and exports.    Politically well disposed towards the Allies, more or less independent of direct pressure from Germany, and entirely dependent on Great Britain for her coal, she was also the easiest nation to deal with.In the early part of 1917 negotiations were opened with the Norwegian Shipowners Association with a view to securing for the Allies the control over the surplus Norwegian tonnage not required for Norway&apos;s own essential needs and an agreement was arrived at in June after negotiations extending from Februaryby
by which in the main this control was secured.vhe agreementhas not been embodied in any formal document but its main proyiare as followsGreat Britain undertook to carry to Norway in British ships ;orway&apos;s coal requirements up to a maximum of 230,000 tons per month and secured in exchange the right to requisition or time-charter all the Norwegian vessels previously employed in the North Sea except cargo liners.    The coal carried to Norway was to be carried at cost on the assumption -that the British ships were running on the hire and at the valuation paid for the Norwegian ships requisitioned in their place.     (This agreement has already resulted in a substantial reduction in the cost of coal to the Norwegian consumer and if the comparatively low ratio of loss hitherto experienced continues this cost should continue to fall).. In addition to this arrangement with regard to the North Sea - which from a tonnage point of view represents little more than an exchange of British for Norwegian ships - Great 3ritain secured the right to time-charter or requisition on the expiry of their present charters all Norwegian ships other than (a)      those required to supply Norway with herfor ordinary trading (fruit steamers, whalers /jc.) and      (c)      The small number of vessels trading to Germany. The terms on which Norwegian veso&amp;ls are requisitioned were -essential imports from overseas;vessels of special construction not suitable(1) The payment of hire at the rate of 35/- per deadwo ton per month in the case of vessels over 1,000 to and 45/- in the case of vessels under this sizetogether with all the expenses of running includinmarine
marine insurance;   and (b) the assumption of the war risk on the vessel in accordance with the scale of values provided for in the Norwegian Tar Insurance Scheme. It was agreed that vessels taken on time charter-should be paid rates calculated to be equivalent to the 3jS/- requisition rate and a scale of rates has subsequently been agreed upon with the Shipowners Association.The present position of Norwegian tonnage other than that already under time charter to the Allies, trading with Germany or engaged in Scandinavian coasting trade is as follows:-Gross TonsA. Tonnage still employed in North Sea		83,000B.    &quot;	employed on voyages to European neutral countries (mainly Belgian relief)	31,0000.    &quot;	employed in distant waters	342,000D.    &quot;	(specially constructed vessels)	193,000B.    11	required for Norway!s overseas imports	228,000 877,000It v/ill be seen that the only source from which any substantial additional help can be drawn is that of the vessels now trading in distant waters.    Nine tenths of this tonnage is at present trading in American waters.7ith regard to the other North Sea countries the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government has been to require the coal licensed for export to any country to be carried in National ships in order to secure that any particular country, while keeping its own ships idle and safe, should not draw on the world&apos;s tonnage for its own needs.    Moreover in order to prevent wholesale withdrawal of ships from the sphere of any direct control we have insisted on the J&apos;ship for shipl? policy, e.g. no Swedish Ship in the United Kingdom is allowed to leave with&apos;coal for Sweden unless a corresponding ship has arrivedq at
at a British port..    These measures combined with the original North Sea freight rules which made the licensing of a coal voyage dependent upon the carriage to this country of an approved cargo or alternatively, of the performance of compensating &quot;duty&quot; voyages with coal to Franco, have enabled sufficient pressure to be exercised on Denmark and Holland to arrive at general tonnage agreements.Denmark    An agreement has been arrived at with Denmark of which the main provisions are(1)   200,000 tons deadweight of Danish shipping will be chartered to His Majesty&apos;s Government for trade in Luropean waters and so long as this amount of tonnage is so chartered His Majesty&apos;s Government will licence the export to Denmark, in Danish ships of 100,000 tons of coal per month,    Danish,ships conveying thin coal are subject to no conditions with regard to return cargoes from Denmark.(2)   The rate of hire paid for Danish ships to be 45/-per ton deadweight per month, war risk for charterers account on a valuation of  30 per ton deadweight.(3)   Danish vessels other than those engaged in trade to or from Denmark, Iceland or the Faroe Islands, to engage in trades of interest to His :Iajesty&apos;s Government, and to ensure this all voyages to be subject to tho approval of the I A*C*E.(4)   No Banish vessels to be laid up without the concurrence of His Majesty&apos;s Government,(5)   Danish vessels proceeding to the   outh Atlantic, &apos;,&apos;est Indies, Gulf ports or via the Panama Canal to charter through the I A.C*&apos;.3. for intermediate voyages with cargo from United States.According to a statement furnished by the Danish ShipownersAssociation
Association the employment of Danish tonnage over 500 tons deadweight was as followsTrading between United Kingdom and Denmark 97,0.00Time chartered or requisitioned by Hisjesty&apos;s Government 160,000Trading between or in British Colonialports 72,000Trading in American waters undertime charter 146,000Other vessels en route to or in U-S-ports 201,000n       trading to or from S-America 100,000In Denmark or on Miscellaneous voyages 118,000894,000Holland.   An agreement with Holland is on the point of conclusion of whioh&quot; the main provisions are(l)   No Dutch vessels to be laid up except with the concurrence of His Majesty&apos;s Government.(2)   His Majesty&apos;s Government license the export of such coal as Holland needs and in return Dutch vessels will be chartered for Belgian Relief voyages of a total gross tonnage not less than the quantity of coal licensed each month.(3)   The Dutch vessels loading coal for Holland to be allowed to come in ballast.(4)   Dutch vessels other than those engaged in trade to or from Holland or sailing in regular lines between Butch Colonies and allied countries to be free to engage in general trades of interest to His Majesty-&apos; Government and each voyage to be subject to previous concurrence of His Majesty&apos;s Government.(5)   Dutch vessels outward bound in ballast or with part cargoes to Gulf, Par East and S* Atlantic to loadcargoes
cargoes in N* America for somo intermediate port and to be chartered for this purpose through the I.A.G.E.(6)   Not less than 90,000 tons deadweight of Dutch shipping to be time chartered to a British firm nominated by His Majesty1s Government for trade outside the danger zone.Sweden,   No agreement has been reached with Sweden though the new Government is more disposed towards entering into negotiations than the old.    They indicate a desire however to negotiate separately with regard to North Sea tonnage and ocean voyages and we are not prepared to consider this.    The question has been submitted to the Foreign Office as to whether the time has not ai-rived when we ought to requisition the Swedish vessels whidh have been lying up in our ports. If we do this v/e shall secure without having to make concession more than we should ever obtain by separate negotiation with regard to North sea trade.Spain,   Our dependence upon Spain for minerals is so complete that we are not in a position to bring any effective pressure to bear and we found ourselves unable to obtain any tonnage concessions.During the first nine months of 1917, 594,000 net tons of neutral shipping have been sunk of which 305,600 net are Norwegian,    The whole of the Norwegian sinkings must be counted as a loss to the Allies in view of our control over the Norwegian mercantile marine.    An analysis of figures of other nationalities shows that rather more than half the losses (154,000 net tons) were of ships sunk, while on services which were clearly in allied interests.    The total loss to the allies therefore resulting from the destruction of neutral ships in the first nine months of 1917 cannot be put at less than 460,000 net tons, or say, 740,000 gross tons.
So far as neutral countries other than Norway are concerned we cannot hope to secure any substantial addition to the neutral tonnage now on our charter available for carrying our overseas imports.    From Sweden   we may obtain a certain amount of tonnage to carry coal to France and Italy, and to some extent replace the inevitable losses in those trades.     But apart from this and from the maintenance by Denmark of the agreed quantity of Danish tonnage we are not in a position to force any neutral tonnage other than Norwegian into war zone trading. We must therefore look to the Norwegian Mercantile Marine as the only source from which we can replace the losses we must anticipate and the only important part of that fleet which is available is that now trading in American waters.     It is clear that even if our losses during the next twelve months are only half those during the period January - September, 1917, and if we secured the whole of this tonnage we should not be any better off in regard to neutral tonnage than we are to-day-
