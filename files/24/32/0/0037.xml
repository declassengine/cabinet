HIS DOCTKEKT IS. THE PHOPERTY ^JjI.S.^MIA^!L0^1PT^&apos;S GO^RlMKTj,.,12Til C HmT. 2637.WAR CABINETin connection with  aTIQNAX_Sjn^YASDJS^Admiraltv Memorandum for the War Cabinet^The question of the employment of military labour raised by the Minister of National Service in his Memorandum to the War Cabinet (G.T.2444) of the 29th October,  is of great importance to the Admiralty, in vie?r of the fact that the Inland Water Transport is being relied upon to construct the national shipyards which are required to carry out the approved programme of merchant ship-building.The Minister of National Service states that military labour is employed by the Inland Water Transport in shipyard construc-tion and shipbuilding for military purposes and this he regards as theoretically legitimate, but he adds that he would strongly deprecate the use of Inland Water Transport units for the con-struction of ne-i slips and for ship construction in ner: yards.Althou ii the construction of National Shipyards may not be strictly for military purposes,  it is desired that,  in considering the Memorandum of the Minister of National Service, the War Cabinet should have the follo^in^ points before them,(l)    It is undoubtedly ri^ht that military and civilian labour snould not be mixed, and also that military units or individual soldiers should not be put at the disposal of civilian contractors, to be employed side by side with civilian labour, but this is not the intention as regards the national shipyards, where it is pro-posed to use military labour and German prisoners who will be employed under military organisation and supervision and could not be allowed to work in close contact with civilian labour.
(E)      Th-o ni&apos;.-!n so employed would bo part of the organisationunder the Direoto&amp;Gerieral of Military Railways, end could atany time, in case of emerfeency, be used for purely militarypurposes either in this country or abroad.(3)       In order to meet any objection that may be raisedthat the Admiralty are competing with civilian labour by payingless wages, the pay of these men could be raised so as to beequivalent to the civilian rate of pay of the District.(4)      The provision of houses for civilian workers would notbe possible.   If civiHandworkers were employed, it would benecessary for them to live in tents, huts, or barracks in thesame manner as military Workers.(5)       The extent to which the Admiralty is relying on theuse of military labour in the new national shipyards will beseen from the following particulars:-&quot;Humber of men it is yroposed to employ in construction of four shipyards and basin and in construction of camps and hospitals - about 13,000Number of men it is prooosec. to employ inthe yards when in full operation -about     17,COONumber of slips in Yards 34Approximate output in gross register tonswhen the shipyards ?-.re in full operation.300.000(tons per annum)To be increased later to a rste of 440,0 00(tons per annum)Should military labour not be employed in constructingthese shipyards, the prospects of completing them in timefor the present emergency are small.(Intlld)   E.G,16/11/17,
