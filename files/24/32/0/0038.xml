(This Document is the Property of HHjj Brlt&amp;mvc Majesty^ GoTTr^l^ *WAR i-RIORITIES COMMITTEE. mdum u,y trie Minister of ReconstruetionIn the course of ;;y &quot;so.uk as Minister of aeconsI ruction,very important considerations have been brought to my at tout.&apos;/ . affecting the position or some vital national industries.The Cabinet recently appointed a Committee under Gonerel :imuts to consider and decide, in an authoritative form, the various conflicting claims between services or departments in connection with priority questions.     It does not appear, however, that any special machinery was created for bringing before the Committee the position of what are primarily civil industries, but the existence of which, in some cases is not mly nece. - any for the continuance of ordinary life, but Is essential l*or the prosecution of the v-ar.      It is clear thatar necessities may re uire even the extinction of some indua-tries, but it is importa:it that steps involving these effects sliouflLd not be taken without a statement of the possible con-sequences being considered at the time,I will only give one illustration- the e &quot;apply of Lead per month, with the maximum, good fortune in shipping, amounts to about 17,000 tons per month, of which only 1,250 tons ere produced at homo.     The direct &quot; ar Office, Admiralty Shipping e.ncl hinistry of aunitions requirements amount to 10, POO   tons in addition to which the Admiralty and other Departments reeul: 2,000 tons per month for paint.   .In consequence of the present shortage, no lead is being allocated for osample-, for the purposes or . hi to Load!., .
vmich tafcos five months to mature, and in six months from to-day there v.dll he no White Lewd in the country, r.nlofs this is altered.     Similarly load for other purposes; has beer cut off and I nay cay that tho following Trades amongst several others in tho not far distent future are threatened with complete extinctionThe Linoleum and Floor-cloth trade. Tho Pottery &apos;j-&apos;raoe. The Paint Trade. The Printing Ink Trade.The maintenance of eleetric accumulatore nor the lighting of institutions and hone; .-.s, and for public vehicle?--, etc.Tho repair of household water end gar; sorviccs.I am not concerned, at this moment to press any parti cui r e c or. ui: en do, t i on in ro snoot of any of those Industrie;:, but I desire, to emphasize tho importance of such consequences as those being present in oun minds When the decisions which involve them arc taken.The Chancellor of tho exchequer recently received a Memorandum from hr. Hichons, the Chairman of the Association cf Controlled Establishments, en the dangerous position that was arising in connection with the maintenance of essential stocks. Another equally vital need is the maintenance and repair of plant and machinery which, not ordinarily classed as a war prior:&apos; cemes into the second category known as Priority p..      m this connection, the supplies on Iced, for example, affect tho maintenance of essential machinery in our Railways, and at our Ports.In view of these considerations, after a careful ox-amination of ehc whole question, I nave com- to the conclusion
that it is necessary that cither I cr someone on my behalf competent to present a statement of the case, should be added to General Smuts&apos; Committoo and that, oubjoot to the consent of the Minister of Munitions, the Head of the Priority Department, Mr. Edgar Jones, before whom the application from civil industries come, should be added to the Permanent Sub-Committoo of General Smuts1 Committee, so an to inform the Committoe of the facts involved when they are considering their decisions on questions of allocation.C. ADDISOii.
