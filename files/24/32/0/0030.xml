(This Document Is the Property ofHis Britannic Majesty^ Government)CopxJiSE C R E T. 0.1/132/377.15.11.17eSituation in Turkey.87In accordance with the instructions of the War Cabinet I submit the following observations regarding the position in Turkey.1,   As the result of General Maude!s recent actions we may reasonably assume that our position in Mesopotamia is for some time to come secure.   He can continue to strike effectively at such hostile forces as may venture to come within his reach in comparatively small numbers, but the length of his communications and the inaction of the Russians render it impossible for him to make any very considerable advance, and therefore he is unable to contribute very directly to the defeat of the Turkish main forces.2,   In Palestine General Allenby has Inflicted a  * severe defeat on nine Turkish divisions.   One fresh Turkish division has arrived from Falkenhayn&apos;s reserve at Aleppo, and there are three Turkish divisions, in addition to possibly one or two German divisions, available in Syria as further reinforcements, but owing to the defects of the Turkish railways these can only be sent south slowly.     In these circumstances it is possible that we may be able to take both Jaffa and Jerusalem, but this is not certain.       Much depends on the action of the Arabs against the Hedjaz railway,, and the extent to which they interrupt communication by that line with Jerusalem.      As to this we have as yet heard nothing, but we expect to hear daily,
3:.     Besides the Turkish and German divisions mention-ed above there are some ten or twelve other Turkish divisions in Caucasia and in other parts of the Turkish Empire which could perhaps be utilised to reinforce those now opposing General Allenby, and other German divisions might be sent into the country.     How many in all could be employed in Palestine depends upon the question of supply, but we estimate that at least 100,000 fighting men could be main-tained south of Damascus.     This is a considerable force, to defeat which might over-tax our available means, and in view of the situation in Europe we must be careful to avoid being drawn into a situation which we can only maintain by a great effort.     We should rather seek to economise force in the East during next summer for the benefit of the European theatres, and-at the same time to reduce our shipping requirements so as to ensure adequate tonnage for the trans-port of American troops and for other urgent services. Therefore, although General Allenby may be able to establish himself in a position in front of Jaffa and Jerusalem, it is improbable that, with his lengthening communications and his approach to the Turkish reserves, he will be able to do more than this, and it is open to question whether he should be asked to do more.      His present instructions are to defend Egypt and to assist in the defence of Mesopotamia by disturbing the German concentration atAleppo
Aleppo - a mission which he has successfully carried out - and it is doubtful whether it y/ould be practicable to expect him to do more. It includes, of course, that he would take advantage of striking the Turks whenever an opportunity presents itself.     These considerations fix the limit of our military effort, subject to such slight modifications as may 3eem justifiable when we receive General Allenby&apos;s views on the situation, which were asked for a few days ago.4.       As regards political and economic pressure the Foreign Office are best qualified to advise, but so far as the General Staff are able to judge the position appears to be as follows.Turkish man-power is diminishing and there is a scarcity of food-stuffs, but as defective communications forbid any very material advance beyond the existing British lines in Palestine and Mesopotamia, and as Russia is impotent to take any serious attack in the Caucasus, the question of man-power will not be very urgent, while it Is obvious that even if peace were made with the Entente Power3 the latter would be unable to do anything to relieve the food scarcity, though doubtless the distribution of the food actually in the country would be facilitated by the cessation of military traffic on the railways.
5,     There is in fact very little reason why the Turkish Government should take the risk of attempting to cast off their German masters.     The rulers of the country. Talaat and Enver, are besides so deeply involved in the success of Germany that it would seem most improbable that they should wish to dethrone those who supply them with all they need. They know how firm a grip Germany has secured on the whole military and administrative machinery of Turkey, and consequent-ly how difficult it would be to shake her off.     The Turkish General Staff and War Office are largely in the hands of Germans, Turkish armies and minor units are commanded by German officers, German machine gun units and artillery are to be found in all Turkish theatres, Germany is the source of Turkish munition supplies, two German divisions are probably now in Asiatic Turkey, and several thousand German and Austrian troops are in Constantinople, which is at the mercy of German warships, the Goeben and the Breslau, anchored in the Golden Horn..     It would seem to be impossible to prevent news of peace negotiations from reaching German ears, and there can be no doubt that numerous arguments, as well as force, would be used to defeat them.     The arguments would consist mainly of appeals to the self-interest both of the members of the Government and of the country at large.     It would be pointed out to the former that financially they were entirely in the power of Germany, while it would be said that the country had everything to hope from a German victory which would restore to Turkey her lost provinces, and perhaps Egypt and Tripoli as well, whereas a peace with the Allies would almost certainly entail loss of territory in Meso-potamia, Armenia, Syria and Arabia.     Recent German victories in Russia and Italy would be pointed to as proofs of ultimate success,
6.     Although the prospects of negotiating a separate peace with the Turkish Government are not hopeful, we might well take advantage of General Allenby &apos;s victories to initiate a vigorous propaganda in Turkey with the object of reducing her to something the same condition as that achieved by Germany in Russia, and for that matter in Italy.   This propaganda should support all persons hostile to the existing government and aim at the over-throw of the latter and the fomenting of food riots and disturbances.   Much might, it is thought, be made of the war weariness of the people.   The Turkish villager, like the Russian, takes a narrow view of life, he cares little for what is happen-ing in distant quarters of the Empire, but he is much affected by the carrying off of his young men and his animals, by his fields going out of cultivation, and by the rise in prices.    He is tired of the war and can be made still more weary of it by active propagandist methods.   Public opinion has not the force in Turkey which it possesses in Western countries but it is not altogether absent in the cities, and steps should be taken to correct fallacious views of the Entente war aims.    It should be made clear that Constantinople will not be taken from the Turks, and that the integrity of the home of the Osmanli race in Anatolia will not be infringed.    If it could be announced that the leaders of the Committee of Union and Progress had refused favourable terms, it is probable that much hostility would be aroused against them and against Germany.   There should be no difficulty in introducing these ideas through Switzerland where large numbers of potential agents are to be found.
7.     Too much, however, should not be expected, for until, either by bribery or persuasion, the Dardanelles have been opened to the passage of British submarines, and the Goeben and Breslau have been destroyed, there is little prospect of any anti-German government, oapable of treating with the Allies, being set up in Constantinople.(Sd.)
