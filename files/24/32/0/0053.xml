2173His Britannic Majesty^ government.)No. 0.AJ)t703.S EC RET,e Chief 0f theGeneral Head Quarters,British Armies in France.15th November, 1917.Imperial General Staff.In accordance with the instructions contained in your 0.1/130/373 steps are being taken to prepare the additional divisions for despatch, with a corresponding force of heavy artillery and aircraft.  1  I note that I am to be prepared to relieve some or all of the divisions in Italy from other divisions in France.under consideration on my present and future operations haveculated already been stated in my secret memorandum No, 0-A.D, 688,linet      dated 31st October, 1917. 11.17.    &apos;Any further offensive on the Flanders front must be at once discontinued, though it is important to keep this fact secret as long as possible.The positions already gained on that front fall short of what I had wished to secure before the winter cessation of active operations.     Our present position about Passchendaele, and between that place and the Ypres - Staden Railway may be difficult and costly to hold if seriously attacked.   Although the German losses have been severe this year I think this latter oontingenoy must be expected as soon as the enemy realises that he has regained the Initiative.    The positions I desired to secure for the winter, however, could not be captured without a greater expenditure of force than would now be justifiable in view of the future liabilities I shall probably have to meet,My vievas as to the general effect of the measuresThe
The surprise operation alluded to In my memorandum of 31st October, above referred to, I hope still to be able to carry out and I am continuing my preparations for it,     The nature of this operation is such that it can be stopped at once if it appears likely to entail orator losses than I can afford.In regard to the general question of the security of the Franco-Belgian front, I beg to invite attention to the views put forward in my memorandum of the 31st October * Taking advantage of the cessation of our offensive it would be reasonable for the enemy to launch attacks, on my front or on the French, in order either to check the despatch of further troops to Italy or to turn to account the comparative Allied weakness here.In view of the advanced season and the existing state of the enemy&apos;s Infantry on this front such attacks are, for the present, unlikely to aim at more than local and limited objectives on which a heavy concentration of hostile artillery fire can be brought to bear.The situation next year, however, may give cause for more serious anxiety if the measures outlined .in your letter are carried out.The British personnel in France Is urgently in need of rest and training,     A serious reduction in their numbers will deny them the opportunities for both and throw a consid-erably increased strain on the forces left in France.But little activity can therefore be maintained during the winter, and the enemy will have time and opportunity to recuperate.     The increased expenditure of energy and man-power on this front and in Italy during the winter will render impossible any serious offensive by the Allies on this front next spring, and under the conditions the enemy is not unlikely to seize the initiative in attack, the power of the British and French Armies to resist which will be comparatively low.The/
The bringing up to establishment of units sent to Italy, their maintenance at full establishment, the relief from this front of divisions exhausted in Italy, the probable extension of the British front, all following on the strenuous efforts made continuously since the beginning of last April, must undoubtedly not only deprive the British Armies of offensive power next year, but will reduce very considerably their fitness to meet and repulse a serious attack.     Moreover, rapid, movement of reserves by rail to meet an emergency will be rendered difficult if not impossible by the diversion of rolling stock to meet the needs of the Italian theatre.I trust that these important points, as well as various other factors brought forward in my memorandum of the 31st October, will receive full consideration in the forming of decisions as to the future conduct of the campaign; and I urge most earnestly that, at least, the drafts required to bring my units up to, and to maintain them at, full establishment may be provided cIf this cannot be done a re-organisation of the British Armies in France will be necessary to adjust the number of divisions maintained to the man-power available to replace wastage.(Sd.)     D. Haig.&quot;Field Marshal, C o: riman J ing - in - C h i o f, British Armies in France.
