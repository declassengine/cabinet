(Thl$ Document is4His Britannic Majic Majesty^ Government.)s   c h ^ g *Copy. No. ^3 14/11/17.0,1/131/375.SITUATION IN LIACJJONIA.1.      As the War Cabinet are aware reports nave &quot;been received during the last two or three weeks to the effect that an attack on the Allied Forces in Macedonia is contemplated.     I do not attach any special iiaportanoe to these reports, hut at the same time it is certain that an attack will be attempted if and when it suits Germany&apos;s purpose to make it.    Although the Bulgars mi^ht prefer to remain on the defensive, merely holding what they have got, there is no reason to suppose that they v/ould not attack if reinforced by a few German divisions, and these could probably be found during the Winter and irrespective of demands in Italy.     The Winter is as good a season as any other for an attack.2,      With the approval of the Primo Minister, I took the opportunity during the recent Conference in Italy to raise the question of the unsatisfactory position in MacBdonia, explaining that we were, as we had been for a long time past,   f: entirely in the dark as to the real situation, except ae regards our own particular sphere.     I added that each time nsws was received of a threatened attack the British Government were necessarily and invariably anxious as to the true state of affairs, and that I was unable to help or advise them because I had no information as to General Sarrail&apos;6 viev/s and intentions.by the French Government instructing General Sarrail tt furnish a comprehensive report on the whole situation, andAs a result of my action a telegram was sent
I was authorised to get all information I could from the French War Office when passing through Paris.   We have not yet received General Sarrail&apos;s reply.   I obtained from the French War Office a copy of some recent instructions sent to him (Appendix A,), and also certain figures as to strengths, but the Staff knew nothing as to General Sarrail^ views, and I gathered that he receives his orders direct from the War Minister and is in no way under the French Staff.   In fact he seems to be allowed to do as he wishes, and apparently no soldier dares to interfere with him.5.     I attach copies of other Papers bearing on the subject, one of which shows the various strengths (Appendices B.C.D.E,). I would draw the attention of the War Cabinetto tho fact (Appendix E.) that while we have four divisions and onto brigade in Macedonia&apos; as compared with eight French divisions, there is a difference of less than 10,000 between the actual strengths in men.        Further, of the eight French divisions three are Colonial, which comprise   a considerable number of Native units drawn from French colonies and of little fighting value,     I may also add that although the French have not withdrawn any divisions, as we have, they have during the last fow wooks reduced the number of battalions in seme of the divisions and by this and other devices have effected a total reduction in their &quot;establishment&quot;, or authorised strength, of 18,000 men.        This establishment is 217,000 whereas the actual strength - vide Appendix E. (French figures) - is 184,000 or a deficiency of 33,000.        Our present deficiency on establishment is 7,000. I gathered that the FrenchWar Office have little hope of being able to find the men to make up their deficiency.       They can only do it by taking away from the depots men j/hom they would prefer to send to the V/ost front.        The question had been referred to the French War Minister and was not yet settled.
4.   The French have recently been sending back to France every man who has been in Macedonia for eighteen months.   The Italians have sent back every man who has had malaria.   We have been able to do very little in this respect at present, but the condition of our troops is now becoming such that we must shortly replace them to a great extent by other men. General Milne has been ordered to furnish a report by the medical authorities.     Apparently a considerable portion of our troops are so sodden with malaria as to be quite unfit for such work as they could have carried out two years ago. The mere fact of being almost continuously on the defensive since 1915 must also have had a very deteriorating effect.5.     But the point I wish specially to submit to the War Cabinet is that no real good will ever be done so long as General Sarrail remains in Command.    I have expressed this opinion on many previous occasions, it has for long been held by both Italians and Serbians, and I believe that the War Cabinet are inclined to agree with it.   Partly out of consideration for the French Government it has however never yet boen pressed home, and the question arises whether this ought not now to be done.   At any rate, if we are to secure ourselves against a probable catastrophe a great improvement must be made on the past.     If the War Cabinet will compare the knowledge they possess of the general situation, of the Commander^ intentions, and of the feasibility of attack and defence in other theatres with the knowledge they possess in regard to Macedonia, I think they will at once appreciate how very defective their knowledge is.     And I am unable to improve it, for General Sarrail will seldom tell anyone what his views and intentions are, and for all I know he may have none of a definite nature.
The command of the heterogenous forces inMacedonia is about the most difficult task any Commander has ever had, and its proper execution demands a first-class soldier.     We have no reason to suppose that either the Russians or Italians in Macedonia will fight any better than they have on their own fronts; the Serbians, though good fighters, are tired and. dig2 pi ri te d;some of the French troops are of secondary quality; the Greeks are making slow progress in raising an Army, and Greece appears to be very luke-warm so far as the war is concerned.     In July we were Informed that ten divisions would be ready in three months, but in addition to the three which then existed only three others have as yet been mobilised and those are not yet in all respects complete.     As I have said above I do not attach any special importance to the recent news of an attack, but as we must assume that Germany will make one as soon as it suits her purpose it is necessary that the &quot;.7ar Cabinet should be informed as to what the Allied situation is , Seeing the large number of men we have in this theatre it is only right that we should insist upon a first-class General being appointed, one upon whom the British War Cabinet can rely and who will, either through the French War Office or General Milne, keep them fully informed of his views and preparations, and be a man who can be trusted to make the best of the resources that are given him.7,       I view the situation at Salonika with grave concern,because of the unsatisfactory qualities of the Commander and the uncertainty as to what the state of affairs is.     Unless immediate steps are taken to improve matters a disaster may ensue.(Sd) w.pi.Robertson.C.1.G.a.
C R E T.losure to 0.1/131/375, Appendix &quot;A&quot;TRANSLATION.The French Minister of War to General Sarrail,November 6th.All the information regarding an enemy offensive in Macedonia comes from Swiss sources:   the information which has reached us from this source agrees with yours.The information supplied by General Berthelot and yourself agree in reporting the movement of Bulgarian elements from the Roumanian front towards Macedonia,The hypothesis of the ultimate employment in Macedonia of the forces withdrawn from the Russo-Roumanian front must not be neglected.In the circumstances all precautionary measures should be taken with a view to the eventuality of an enemy offensive on your front.Measures have been taken to expedite as far as possible the despatch of Serbian elements, and of materiel for the Near Eastern Army,     General Braquet has been asked to proceed as rapidly as possible with the organisation of the three Venizelist Divisions.I am taking steps to obtain from the Russian and Roumanian High Commands a demonstration of activity on the Russo-Roumanian front with a view to holding enemy forces there.On the other hand, I can only remind you of the instruc-tions sent to you on October 20th limiting the task of the Near Eastern Army to maintaining the integrity of its front.
Enclbsure to 0,l/l5l/57S..Appendix UB&quot;ATTACH!: HILITAIRE DE SERBIr;,No. 1625. Confidential.AIDE115, Gloucester Road,London S.1&apos;/, November 6th, 1917,KOI R E,Serbian Military Attache had the honour in presenting to the Chief of General Staff his Aide Memoire of the 24th October last, where he communicated the contents of a Y/iro of the Serbian Headquarters, namely, that the enemy has reinforced his front with 7 Bulgarian and 3 German regiments asking respectfully that our A.llios also send reinforcements to prevent enemy1s offensive against Salonika Front,To-day the Serbian -Military Attache has received from his Headquarters another wire stating that from different parts&apos;serious informations have been received that the enemy contemplates an offensive at the Salonika Front on a large soale with considerable forces taking them from Roumania and other parts of his front where such troops, considering present situation, are not necessary.Evidently the enemy is concentrating these forces to get rid of Allied Forces at Salonika and to command the whole Balkan Peninsula and to get very important Salonika Port where from he could then -Increase his naval action in the Iloditorrancan making their communications impossible, and what is very important, preventing- Greece to enter the war.If our enemy unfortunately succeeds in his intention, that would bo an event of detriments of no end for the whole position of the Allies.The low moral in the enemy&apos;s lines and also in Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria, Turkey and Germany would be restored.
2.Evidently our powerful Allies are not going to allow to give a new life to our enemy to continue the war as he is now nearly exhausted.Therefore the Serbian Military Attache requests respectfully again the Chief of the General Staff to find a possibility of sending reinforcements to Salonika Front as soon as possible - new forces with a certain number of large calibre (.220m/m) of Artillery and so enable the prevention of enemy&apos;s offensive and at the same time create a possibility for a successful, rapid and certain offensive which would end great deal of the War-Fate to our advantage,
Enclosure to 0.1/151/575. Appendix %&quot;.E.L.S. 931. SECRET.8th November, 1917,NOTE FOR COLONEL FAGALDE.General Braquet wired from Athens on November 6th that the internal situation in Greece has become distinctly less good during the past month; the simple reason being that the people are hungry,No doubt the Greeks themselves are in some degree respons-ible; Government services lack system, war profiteering is carried on with impunity, and tonnage Is immobilized by in-fluential shipowners.   On the other hand, Greece possesses five or six times as much tonnage as she requires for the food supply of her population; the Entente has taken her ships without leaving her the number required for her imports and it is, not unnaturally, argued that, Greece being the Ally of the Entente, the latter should either return Greek shipping, or else assume responsibility of feeding the Greek population.The result is deep feeling against the Entente and the Venizelist Government; the reactionaries, on the one hand, and the Socialists, on the other, make every use of it.     The Socialist party is a new element in Greece and launches against the Government and the wealthy classes as violent diatribes as martial law will allow.   Anti-Government demonstrations would probably occur in Athens and in certain Pelepenetian towns but for the existence of martial lawaMartial law, however, is not conducing to that state of morale which is desirable for a country at the beginning of a campaign.      If mobilisation were ordered to-day there would be more absentees than there would have been had it been ordered a month ago; unless the situation changes the situat-ion will become more and more acute, and Greek war preparations will suffer accordingly.It
It should be observed in passing that the Greek troops are at the present moment in a condition of depression which is due to physical causes, and unless very heavy wastage is to take place at the beginning the Greek troops ought to be really well fed for some weeks before sending them to the front.To sum up, the Government requires money and the people require bread.     In view of the want of organising capacity of the Greeks, neither of these should be given except under French or Anglo-French local control, M, Venizelos will be making no small sacrifice in submit^ ting to this Foreign control, though he must understand that It is in his interest and that of Greece, to do so.      His presence in Paris will allow of the question being settled under the best possible conditions.

Enclosure to 0.l/l3l/575. Appendix &quot;D&quot;SECRET,OPERATIONS.From: G.0.C-in-0.,Salonika. Handed in 6.40 p.m. 8.11.17, To:      C.I.G,S. Received 11.30 p,m. 8.11.17.G.C.945.Your 44940 cipher November 7th,We consider that probably 21 Bulgarian Battalions and 3 Cavalry Squadrons have been transferred from Roumania to Macedonia.    There is no trace of the arrival of German troops.   My impression from prisoners&apos; and deserterrs evidence is that there is no intention or desire on the part of the Bulgarian Army to attack on this front.   Nor do I think that the Bulgarian Army would attack except in conjunction with German forces.    Undoubtedly there lias been lately consider-able extra movement on the Vardar Doiran and Struma fronts, This movement we have so far been unable to account for but there is nothing to justify an inference that it is in connection with an offensive design.    The rumoured advent of the Greek Army has made the Bulgarians apprehensive as is shewn by their increased work on defences and constant registration of their own wire and by their having offered special rewards for captured prisoners from us.The situation is being v/atched carefully as possible with the means at our disposal.    The ammunition situation will be satisfactory when the recent promised increase arrives. The weakest aspect of the force is now as it always has been the L, of C..with-England.
