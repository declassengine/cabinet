HisGovernment)183Intelligence Bureau.Department of Information.Nov. 15th. 1917.SPECIAL   MEfcQH/JjjjljMonThe Situation in Switzerland.The following has &quot;been received from a thoroughly trustworthy (British) correspondent, who has quite recently returned from Switzerland.&apos;    A further instalment will fallow.(1) Introductory.I was in Switzerland three weeks - from October 15th to Nov-ember 5th.     I snent more time at Geneva &amp;han anywhere olse, but I also visited Lausanne-, Yevey, Montreux, the Valais, Berne (twioe) and Luzern.    As this list will sh*w, my travelling was preotioally confined to French-speaking Switzerland.     On the other hand, I have a strong impression that the tension of feeling, and division of opinion, between the French and German speaking parts of the country is decreasing.    For instance,, when certain organs in Germany tried to make an incident out of M, Ador&apos;s speech, the re-action in Switzer land did not appear to follow linguistic lines. The resentment seemed to be general;   it v/as felt that Germany wastampering with Switzerland&apos;s national independence;   and the analogy of Germany&apos;s racial policy in Belgium was evidently in peopled minds.     Naturally the Swiss press at Geneva and Lausanne took a stionger line than at Zurich and Berne, but In both regions, I think, the press v/as interpreting (in its own fashion) a uniform public opinion.The Swiss are completely obsessed by their economic problem -
2.lack of food and lack of fuel - and this problem cuts across their linguistic divisions. It sets - not Romand against Allemand, but town against country and class against class.(2)The federal Elections.I was in Switzerland during the Federal Elections.   On accuunt 9t the particular introductions I had, I saw the Elections from the Bourgeois - and rather the Conservative Bourgeois - side. At geneva, for instance, my acquaintances were mostly democrat?-The fear of the Socialists was very real.     The chief point raised against them by the Bourgeois parties was their uncon-cbLled. policy of &quot;No National Defence&quot;;   but I doubt whether this policy is more than an academic doctrine - I doubt, that is, whether the Socialists would really pursue it if they found them-selves in power - and there are important Socialist groups, for instance Siggfs group at Geneva, which do not hold by it.     Just before the Elections the   Genevese Socialists had split into two fractions, the foreigners (who had out voted the native Genevese), and the native Genevese (led by Sigg), who were more moderate than the foreigners and wished to pursue a policy of their own.In reality, &quot;* thiafc, the 3ourgeois fear the Socialists not for their military policy, but for the sweeping social changes which they are determined to introduoe.   The Sooialists have ex-ploited the economic situation against the Bourgeois.     The Bourgeois, they say, are in power, and look at the result; Capitalists become profiteers, the population suffers privations. And since the population is obsessed by the economic situation, this propaganda has had extensive results - or so the Bourgeois evidently fear.     The Bourgeois attack the Sooialists for ascrib-ing to them misfortunes due to external causes beyond Swiss control.
But when people are suffering they always prefer a scape-goat in visible form and within their roach;   and for this reason, I think, the Socialist analysis of the situation commended itself better than the Bourgeois analysis to the workers in the towns, who chiefly feel the pinch. ho campaign against General Wills and Swiss Militarism, which has been waged in the Prench-Swiss press, had practically lapsed while I was in Switzerland - doubtless because of the extreme anti-militarist position which the Socialists had taken up.    At Geneva, in the elections, it was a convenient plank in the platform of *ne Democratic candidate only, who was disliked as a demagogue and who was practically repudiated by the Journal de Geneve.    The coalition of the two traditional parties at Genera - the Democrats and Radicals - to resist the rising socialist tide, was looked on as a dramatic event.     It must be added that the two parties quarrelled during the Elections.    The Democrats declared that they had voted for all the Radical condidates in their common ticket but that the Radicals had abandoned one candidate of theirs.I was not in Switzerland long enough to see the final result of the Elections.    There were an abnormal number of second ballots. The state employees with fixod incomes drew attention by their special discontent, their effective organisation, and their influence over the results.    In the Valais, for example, (a thinly populated Canton traversed by a great trunk railway), foar of the &quot;Cheminots&quot; was marked among the Bourgeois.    The Oatholios had no common polioy, hut studied their sectional interest in the different districts to a nicety, and voted accordingly.     In the Luzern lake regica; where they are ultra-conservative, thoy voted, I believe, with the Bourgeois; in the industrial districts of Neuchatol and the Jura there were oases wjere they defiled round the backs of the Bourgeois and votod
for the Socialist candidate. (g) Enemy Peace PropagandaWhile the bocialietc exploit tho economic situation in Switzerland for the Bovolution, the German and Austrian propaganda agencies exploit it for peace.    The method is to control aa many newspapers as possible, refrain rigidly from all discussion of concrete peace-terms, and suggest the desirability of peace in it-self.    One has only to see the economic situation in Switzerland, and the longing for peace which it produces, to realise how effect-ive this propaganda may be.    It merely strengthens an impulse that flows inevitably from the situation.     The enemy expectation doubt-less is that when the impulse has been intensified to a certain *iegre-s, degree, something will happen - that somo internal event, like a reduotion of the bread ration, or external ovent, like the Italian disaster, will produco a definite land-slide of Swiss public opinion, violent enough to carry the governmont away with it, into an attempt at mediation or something of the kind.    In French-speaking Switzer-land, of course, another motive for influencing the papers is that they are widely read in Prance.I was in Switzerland when the Italian disaster happened. The impression it created was naturally great, and I heard uneducated people occasionally express the opinion that it would shorton the war, because it would prove to the Entente the impossibility of victory.    Educated pooplo, on the other hand, evidently thought that the war would now bo prolonged till America had developed her maximum strength.    I believe this is the opinion of intelligent Swi Swiss, whatever their sympathies.The enemy peace propaganda through the press seems to me of much more importance than the propaganda literature in the book-shops, but I always looked at the bookshops when I visited a new
1 town.     /t Geneva our superiority in the shop-windows is crushing;1I at Lausanne marked;   at Borne the Germans have completely the upper hand.    V/yss of Berne does for Germany what Payot of Lausanne does for us,    Berne was plastered with v/yss1 publications - par-ticulaily a pamphlet on the Sukhoialinov Revelations and.another on the Curfeo-Tatars of the Russian Empire (written by one of them.). A pilaster of the araade An front of the biggest bookshop in Berne was completely swathed with copies of the Sukhomlinov pamphlet, with its bright yellow cover.     In the kiosquos at Berno, on tho other hand, French and English illustrated papers hold their own against Gorman fairly woll. (4) The Economic SituationThe Economic Problem, as I have suggested, is the koy to the present situation in Switzerland.     It is at the bottom of the Federal Elections, at the bottom of the Enemy Peace Propaganda, and at the bottom of the Swiss attitude towards the various belli-gerent powers.     It resolves itself into two needs - coal and bread -and two anxieties - Germany and America.The prestige of America is now very high In Switzerland, because it is widely believed that at the beginning of next year America oan starve the Swiss, and that if she considers it expedient she will not hesitate to do so.    Articles which appear at intervals in the American Press, marshalling statistics of Swiss imports into Germany, are reaiLand replied to in Switzerland feverishly, but without much hope that America oan be deflected from her course. Resentment at tho British conduct of the Blockade has receded inti the background.     In the eyes of the Swiss Amerioa is to England as King Stork to King IogJ but at the same time &quot;resentment&quot; is not what the S?/ice feol towards the American policy.     Thoy seem to. regard America au elemental, non-human force, which cannot be arguedAwith, resisted or conxrolledt
Among uneducated people this awe of America expresses itself in the catch word:    &quot;America will make us march in the Spring&quot; - &quot;How?&quot; - &quot;They will give us no bread if we don&apos;t&quot;.     I believe there is no positive foundation for this idea, and that it is simply the most forcible expression of the power *f life and death w ieh the Swiss feel that America wields over them.     Educated people do not repeat it, and tell ene, when questioned, that the danger of Switzerland being drawn in is less than it was in earlier phases of the War.     But they never admit that the danger is over. Possibly thiB   is an instinctive movement of protection against the Socialists, since such an admission would greatly strengthen the case of the Sooialists for abolishing national defence.The  ne thing more urgent than bread is coal, and here Switzerland is in Germany&apos;s hands.     Germany&apos;a policy with regard to the importation of coal is certainly resented as well as feared, and that is German-speaking Switzerland as well as French, since both sections of the country are affeoted by it equally.     To take the case of the hoteliers:-   to keep their hotels heated, even to a minimum degree, they have to buy a quantity of Gennan eoal whioh, by the terms Germany imposes, involves taking shares in the German ooal-syndicate as well as paying the prioe of the ooal itself.     Coming after throe lean years (for since the outbreak of the War the hotel business has been slack in all Swiss oentres except Berne and, Zurich) this has hit the hoteliers very hard, $hey now add so-Jnuoh a day extra for chauffage to the pricft of their rooms, and this alienates their guests (now mostly refugees with few francs to &quot;spare) while it does not fully re-coup them for the extra toll v/hich Germany exacts.       Therefore the hoteliers do not love Germany at present, and their ler:d is followed by the
considerable element that lives by the hotels - waitersr blanahisseuses, caterers, small tradesmen.     The resentment of these people towards Germany is not diminished by the faot that the they may happen to   speak German as their native language,At the same time Germany is feared.     The monthly deliveries of German coal have seldom reached the promised total, and this has given rise to the rumour that Germany is deliberately keeping the 3tocks of coal in Switzerland low, in order to paralyse the Swiss defence in the event of a German invasion.     The Chemins de Fer Federaux are said to have enough coal to mobilise the Army fully and transport it to the frontier, brt not to keep it supplied with food and munitions.     rr.ranLport,  it is said, would break down before stocks of French and British coal could arrive, the Swiss Army would be paralysed, and the Germans would marsh through.The problem of coal is certainly more acute than that of bread.     The train service has been drastically reduced;   trains are only to be heated when the temperature is more than five degrees below freezing point;    people with big houses in Geneva are sh&amp;tting up all but two or three room3;    people with more than a certain number of cubic metres of standing timber in their gar-dens or on their estates are compelled to cut down a certain quantity and deliver it to their commune.     The Swiss will perish of cold before they have time to starve of hunger.17. 11. 17.(Second instalment to follow).
