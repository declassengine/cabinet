Tos-     C.I.G.S., War Office.Despatched 8.20 p.m. 13.11.17. Received 11.55 a.m. 14th Nov. 1917.670 November 13th.Situation morning November 13th.3rd Army.   Enemy lodgment at Zenson has not been yet cleared out.   It appears that enemy under cover of fog and of artillery barrage succeeded in passing river at northern and southern angles of bend above and below Zenson and in establishing himself there with a number of machine guns followed up by a considerable force of infantry of which the strength is not known.   This constitutes a bridge-head which has a depth of one kilometre and all Italian efforts to dislodge enemy have failed so far. There are reports also that the enemy is collecting boats opposite upper and lower crossings.   Bridging material and troops are also being collected at Case Grave near island in the river and near Stabiuzzo. 4th Army.     Aircraft report nothing seen on roads north of Feltre .   At San Pietro Do Barbozza there are heavy guns, now firing at Pederobba.   Medium artillery is firing at Monte Tomba and Fener, patrols and signals have been observed east of Vidor , covering troops are on the line Primulana-Col Del Gallo and Anten.Line of defence at junction of 1st and 4th Armies crosses the Brenta just west of Monte Moschin but it is probable that this line will be established further forward,as
as also Line on Piave , in conformity with decision to hold Monte Tomatico and Monte Roncone .1st Army.      On the front of 26th, 22nd and 20th Corps enemy attacked again last night towards head of Val Frenzela, Monte Longara and Gallio in considerable strength after an artillery preparation.   These attacks were delivered on Italian Advanced Line and were almost all repulsed, only some elements of trenches on Monte Longara and at Gasa Spil north-east of Gallio were left In enemy&apos;s hands. Austrian troops were pushing up towards head of Guelbach valley and the Baekstal.It is reported that enemy&apos;s losses were very heavy especially from Italian gas shells .   Italian line of resistance, which has been prepared for some considerable time, passes along line Monte Sisemol, Monte Stenfle, across the Val di Ronchi and round Monte Miletta which is a strongly prepared position .In the Val Lagarina movements of transport amount-ing to about 500 vehicles were observed in direction of the plateau.   On Monte Pasubio enemy artillery is registering. nemy is reported to be considerably reinforced on Asiago plateau.   It is calculated that between Pasubio and the Ortegara there are 51 battalions .   Italian General Staff believe another 25 battalions of the 11th and 3rd Divisions have also arrived but these reports are not yet substantiated.In Sugana valley there are 14 enemy battalions. Situation though for the moment not excessively disquieting is not improving .   The main facts are that enemy has established a lodgment at Zenson and his intention ta develop outflanking offensive from direction of Asiago plateau is becoming more evident.
