rThis Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.] --    --- -   - 167Printed for the War Cabinet.   November 1917.SECRET.PEACE NEGOTIATIONS WITH TURKEY.SOUND as is the general policy of combining diplomatic advances with military pressure as a means of shortening the war, and attractive as is the idea of making overtures to Turkey with a view to a separate peace, I am myself convinced that the time has not come for any such action on our part, and that at the present juncture it would not only be attended with failure, but would greatly diminish the chances of success later on.For at least six months, since the dramatis personal were Mr. Elkus and Mr. Morgenthau, we have heard of the Turkish desire, believed to be personified in Talaat Pasha, to conclude a separate peace with this country. None of these conversations has resulted in anything. It is more than doubtful whether the agents employed had any authority. Certainly the principals have never appeared on the scene. No evidence has been adduced to show that Talaat, even supposing his hostility to Enver to be authentic, and his desire for peace genuine, has the power to effect a revolution, or to overthrow Enver, or to carry the Young Turkey party with him. Neither is there any evidence to justify the conclusion that Turkey has at all modified her pan Turanian ambitions, which have been greatly expanded since tue war began, or that she has been sufficiently humbled to induce her to conclude the only sort of peace that we should be in a position to offer.For what would be the nature of such a peace ? We are appa-rently to leave her Constantinople, but to deny her the control of the Straits (for. indeed, unless we did that we might as well have not fought at all); to agree to the abolition of the Capitulations, and relieve her of a considerable portion, if not the whole, of her financial obligations to Germany; to secure her in the possession of the original Ottoman dominions in Asia Minor (at the expense of our French and Italian Allies), but to lop off Syria, Palestine, Arabia, and Mesopotamia, with such window-dressing arrangements as may conceal the reality of the loss and humour her national pride.Now, even supposing we were to negotiate upon such a basis, which I do not myself think that we are in a position to do, is there a reasonable chance that Talaat or a majority of the ruling clique at Constantinople for it is not Talaat but only a Turkish Govern-ment that can conclude peace would be prepared to accept such terms ?I am compelled to answer this question in the negative for two reasons : (1) That the terms are not good enough ; (2) that whether good or bad, the Turks are not physically in a position to entertain them.I do not think them good enough, because I have little doubt that Germany can promise, and has promised, better. I should be greatly surprised if she has not led the Turks to expect not merely that she will recover the whole of Palestine and Baghdad for them, as soon as she has completed the defeat of the Italian and Russian armies, but Egypt and very likely Tripoli as well. Very probably the islands have been thrown in also.The physical conditions supply an even greater obstacle.   How is
it possible for Talaat, or the C.U.P., or.the Young Turk party, or any. Turkish Government that can be thought of, to contemplate going out of the war as long as the guns of the &quot; Goeben&quot; and &quot; Breslau &quot; are trained upon Constantinople, the railways and tele-graphs are in German hands, every important strategic position in the neighbourhood of Constantinople and the Straits is controlled by German engineers, the Turkish army is intermixed with German units, and is to a large extent commanded by German officers, and Germany has, as I believe she has, an almost complete command of Turkish finance, industry, resources, and trade ?But supposing that these are not facts but assumptions (though I doubt if our Intelligence Department will dispute any one of them), and that Turkey, in order to get out of the war and to shake off the German yoke which she must most cordially detest, is willing to embark upon a struggle against this embarrassing and overpowering embrace, are we in a position to offer her even the terms which I have sketched ?1 say nothing of the difficulty of negotiating about Asia Minor without the knowledge and assent of Russia, Italy, and Fiance, and the absolute impracticability of settling the future of (lonstantinople and the Straits behind the back of Europe because it may be said that only preliminary pourparlers are in contemplation, and that before they had gone very far our Allies could and would be taken into consultation by us.Neither do I dwell upon the certainty that the first overture made through or to a Turkish intermediary would be at once made known in Berlin; and that clandestine agencies are the very last method of doing business with the Ottoman Turk.But I ask how far our own pledges and commitments will enable us to make any concession, even that of a purely ostensible or nominal sovereignty, to the Turks in respect of the Asiatic possessions which we have in part or in whole lopptd off from her.Almost in the same week that we have pledged ourselves, if successful, to secure Palestine as a national home for the Jewish people, are we to contemplate leaving the Turkish flag flying over Jerusalem 1We have committed ourselves to the liberation of Armenia. Russia is powerless, even if she were willing, to help. Is Turkey once again to exercise a nominal sovereignty over the Armenians ? If so, tlieir future would indeed he beyond the range of hope.When we took Busrah the Viceroy of India promised the inhabitants of that vilayet that it should never return to Turkish rule.   That promise at least cannot be broken.When we took Baghdad we issued a Proclamation, approved by the Cabinet, promising that an Arab State should be set up in those territories, and that the Turk should disappear. That is another promise which we cannot break.When we instigated the Arab rising in the Hejaz, we led King Hussein to think that not merely would he gain and keep the Holy Cities (he has not yet obtained possession of Medina), but that Arab aspirations would be satisfied, and Arab independence set up in the whole of the regions from Akaba to Damascus, and from Mecca to the Persian Gulf. Grave, indeed, would be the consequences if the Turkish flag were to reappear in any form whatsoever in those regions.If 1 am right with respect to these considerations, it seems to me that we are precluded from offering to the Turk any solatium in the regions which i have been examining, and that, so far as they are concerned, we have to implement our promises to our friends or partners there before we commence to deal with the Turk, and that even when we do the latter, we can consent to no terms that will not involve the permanent exclusion of these territories from Turkish authority in any shape or form.
My conclusion is that the time for peace negotiations with Turkey has not yet come; that our position in Palestine and Meso-potamia must be more firmly assured before we can undertake them with any prospect of success, and that when they are opened the overtures should come, not from us, but from the Turk himself. Tn dealing with an Oriental people psychology is a more important guide than is either logic, or policy, or cleverness, or finesse. If we approach the Turk now, he will consider, not whether we are offering him good or bad terms, nor whether it will be wise for him to close while he can, but that in coining at all we have admitted that we are not the victorious, but the beaten, party, or at least the party that expects to be beaten; and he will to a certainty connect our action with what has happened in Russia, and still more in Italy.As far back as June last the late American Ambassador at Constantinople told Sir H. liumbold that &quot; so long as the Turkish Government were dominated by the present Grand Vizier and by Enver, the possibility of making a separate peace with Turkey was out of the question. Several members of the Turkish Government were in favour of trying to make a separate peace with the Allies, but he did not see how Turkey could shake off the Germans in present circumstances. The only way to checkmate the Germans would be if the Turks who are in favour of a separate peace could manage by a successful coup to throw open the Dardanelles to the Fleets of the Allies.&quot;That seemed to me to be a very true forecast then, and I believe it to represent accurately the Turkish position now. Until our position is a stronger one, not only in the local but in the continental theatre of war, I seriously doubt the wisdom of approaching the Turk. When it is stronger in either theatre, or in both, he will probably approach us. Such pourparlers as have already taken place, as well as the public utterances of statesmen, must have convinced him that we are not out for his annihilation, even if this were not prohibited by the facts and prospects of the war.C. or K.November 16, 1917.
