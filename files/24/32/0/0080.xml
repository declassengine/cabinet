JI5l!^2 Hm !!lj Property of 488- RECALL OP CIVIL SERVANTS FROM THE COLOURS.Memorandum by the Minister of Reconstruction.I have decided- to ash the attention of the Far Cabinet to a matter which has been in my mind for some time and the importance wf which has struck me with increasing force since I entered on my duties as Minister of Reconstruction.Re have now reached a point when it is almost impossible to secure Civil Servants for new work.    By turns, the Far Office, the Ministry cf Munitions, the Shipping controller, the Director of National Service and the Food Controller have made such drafts en the other offices that trained officials are not to be had even when they are wanted for the most responsible work of a kind which only trained officials can undertake.   And from now onwards they will be wanted more and more.    I have-already seen enough of the work of reconstruction to realize that the problems are at least as difficult, at least as delicate and far more intricate than those involved in normal administration, and for the effective and tactful handling of them (on which the credit of the Government is bound very largely to depend) we shall require all the skilled assistance wc can get.    And so far as I can see there is only one source from which we can get it.   Re ought to begin recalling Civil Servants from the Army.
As a rule the senior and abler of the younger men have not been allowed to join the Colours. But exceptions have been made and there are I think few departments who are not deploring the less of some officer who would have been of far greater service to the country in civil administration, even during war time, than in the Army.    I recognize the force j..&apos; the arguments on the other side - the bad impression that would be created had the whole service been exempted and the injustice of refusing young men an opportunity of taking their share directly in the war.    And I realise that in the case of the lower ranks cf the service the peace establishment was on a luxurious scale and that experience has. demonstrated the possibility cf maintaining&apos; a high level of efficiency with substitutes in every grade.At the same time I feel that we cannot any longer regard the service of peace as being satisfactorily equipped If it has only the leavings of war. My own department furnishes me with, an illustration,    he are engaged on very important enquiries  (many of a most secret character) into the supply and control of raw materials.      It is really vital that we should have a first rate Civil Servant on the work. Of the three men I selected as suitable two cannot be spared by the department now employing them; the third can give only a few hours wa iveok to the work, his assistant can only give   ilittle mere.   And in trying to find a good statistical clerk for the same branch I discovered that the head of a very important technical office to whom I applied for help had been so reduced by recruiting that he had actually had to part with his personal clerks to another department.
This is not a matter merely of the convenience and comfort of hinisters and Heads of Departments.    Unless an adoouate and competent subordinate staff is there, much of the really essential preliminary work of reconstruction will be undone or badly done, and we shall confront the critical period of transition with plans incompletely  thought out or based on imperfect knowledge.I suggest therefore that the War Cabinet should authorize me in consultation with the V/ar Office, Admiralty, and the Director of National Service to prepare a plan fcr the recall cf expert civil servants from the Colours for Reconstruction.    I think it is essential that the men so recalled should not be returned automatically to their departments, but should be regarded as a general reserve to b assigned by the Civil Service Commissioners to any department in urgent need of the1 .The principle has been accepted by tho Army Demobilisation Committee which has recommended that officials of the Employment Exchanges should be demobilised first in order to get the demobilisation machinery started. 1 am therefore only proposing an extension of a principle which, has already been discussed and approved.
