jthig Document Is the Property cfsecret.his britannic majesty^ governmentMINISTRY   OF   FOOD.emort for week ending wednesday, november 14, 1917.PART I.-ACTION TAKEN. Control of Prices and Supplies.s   ifThe Liter-Allied Meat and Fats Executive held a special meeting on Tuesday, November 13th, to meet Dr. Taylor, the representative of the U.S.A. Food Adminis-tration.Dr. Taylor gave a detailed account of the position of the U.S.A. in respect of the Allied requirements. Until next year there would be a shortage of hog products, due to an epidemic of hog-cholera and a shortage of feeding stuffs, and he urged that until then the Allies should, as far as possible, substitute the use of vegetable for animal oils and products. The position was, however, improving and lie hoped that, given a little time, the U.S.A. would be able to meet all reasonable require-ments.In connection with the export of tinned meat he referred particularly to the difficulty caused by the great shortage of tin and tinplates and of palm-oil and urged that every effort should be made to meet American requirements in these respects.Financial difficulties are still seriously hampering Mr. Owen Smith&apos;s purchases, and the inability of the Treasury to provide dollar credits is limiting the supply of exported food-stuffs from the U.S.A. This restriction shows itself in further shortages on the English market.Bacon, Hams, and Ijard. Larger supplies of American bacon and hams are now arriving though the purchases in the week ending the 10th November were the smallest since the 22nd September. 112,712 boxes still await shipment on the other side.The question of prices for Canadian bacon has been discussed and it is thought that a decision will be made immediately.Further progress has been made with an Order fixing maximum prices for bacon and with the scheme of distribution.Butter.-Representatives of Produce Exchanges met on 14th November, under the Chairmanship of the Director of Butter and Cheese Supplies, to discuss a scheme of equitable distribution of butter; the Butter (Distribution) Order, 1917, has since been issued, providing for means of distribution through importers, wholesalers, and blenders. A maximum retail price will be fixed from time to time by the Food Controller. Forms of application for supplies from retailers, manufacturers and. public institutions have been issued through Local Food Control Committees, and forms for blenders, wholesalers, and importers have been issued with general instructions through Produce Exchanges and associations. The quantity of butter applied for must not exceed the amount sold or used in 1910.Cereals. The Oats Products (Retail Prices) Order, 1917, dated November 10, 1917, revises the maximum retail prices for oat-flour and oatmeal, rolled, flaked, or other like products of oats, from November 26th. In Scotland. Northumberland, Durham, Cumberland, Westmorland, Lancashire, Yorkshire, and Cheshire, the new price for oatmeal, rolled oats, flaked oats, or other like products, will be 2s. Od. for every 7 lb., or ?j\d. per lb. for less quantities, while in all other parts of the United Kingdom the prices will be 2s. 3d. and 4cZ., respectively. The maximum price for oat-flour will, in all cases, be one-halfpenny per pound more. No extra charge may be made lor packages, delivery, or credit.The Testing of Seeds Order, 1917, dated November 12, 1917, provides that on and after 1st January 1918, no seedsman, grower, or farmer shall sell or expose any seeds (as defined in the First Schedule to the Order) unless a sample has previously been taken and tested in accordance with the Order either by or on behalf of the seller or at the Seed Testing Station of the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries, the Board of Agriculture for Scotland, or the Department of Agriculture and Technical Instruction for Ireland.   In the case of a sale certain particulars prescribed by theA   (33)1299-3   Pk 1   70   11/17   E &amp; S A
Order must be correctly declared to tlie purchaser at or before the time of sale or delivery in writing, either in an invoice of the seeds or in some other form; provided that it shall be sufficient for the purposes of this provision if the declaration is made by reference to a printed catalogue or to a price list containing the particulars required by this Order; and provided also that in the case of a sale and delivery prior to the 1st July 1918, the declaration need not be given unless demanded by the purchaser in regard to any quantity of the following seeds:-pea, beau, garden turnip, parsnip, onion, carrot, beet, garden cabbage, garden kale ; and in the case of any sale or delivery need not be given in respect of sales not exceeding 2 lbs. of pea and bean, and not exceeding 8 ozs. of garden turnip, parsnip, onion, carrot, beet, garden cabbage, garden kale. In the case of seeds exposed fur sale other than those specifically enumerated a copy of the required declaration must be conspicuously exposed on or in connection with the seeds.Dried Fruits. Cables received from Mr. Burlumi show that the Greeks are not yet prepared to accept our prices for currants. We have threatened to withdraw the mission unless we can make purchases at what we consider reasonable prices. In the meantime it is hoped that an opportunity will be given to discuss the whole question with M. Venizelos, who is at present in London.The Foreign Office are endeavouring to arrange the grant of export licences for Portuguese figs in the name of Mr. Barter, our representative in Portugal. Failing that, the Foreign Office are pressing the Portuguese Government to make some arrangement whereby we can purchase ligs at reasonable prices.Contracts have now been signed for the purchase.of 12,000 ions of Basra dales. 5,000 tons are being lifted by a ship leaving Basra this week. It is hoped to ship the balance on the next favourable tide at the end of November.011&apos;ers have been received of a considerable quantity of Indian and Afghan sultanas. Enquiries are being instituted as to the possibility of shipment from Bombay and Karachi.Currants and sultanas required for the making of plum puddings for the troops have been released to the firms nominated by the War Office. Arrangements have been concluded with the Swedish Government for the release to these firms of raisins owned by the Swedish Government, and lying in the United Kingdom, lor the purpose of making plum puddings. A further quantity of currants and sultanas requisitioned under tho Order have been released to the Navy and Army Canteen Board. Forms have been sent out to manufacturers to ascertain the quantities of currants and sultanas required by them for Government work, in order that the balance of the requisitioned currants and sultanas may be distributed, after the War Office and the Navy and Army Canteen Board requirements have been met.Feeding Stuffs. The question of licensing all dealers in feeding-stuffs is now-being discussed, and it is hoped to put this into effect shortly. The possibility of combining the importing trade for the purpose of regulating purchases, and allocating the supplies of imported cattle foods, is also being discussed.A small committee of experts is being set up to devise means of rationing dairy stock ; provincial feeding-stuffs committees are also being set up in different areas throughout the country, and regulations have been drawn up for their use.Fish. The withdrawal of the Scottish herring fleet from Great Yarmouth was threatened early in the week. The reasons assigned were the exceptionally bad weather, loss of gear, the difficulty of getting paraffin for motor engines, the fear thai, the area in which fishing was permitted by the Admiralty was becoming &quot;fished out/&apos; and the impression on the part of a large number of fishermen that they were to be called up for naval service at the end of November. The last two of these points have been met by the Admiralty who have extended the fishing area, and postponed the calling-up of the fishermen. The fishermen were short of food supplies, and had already made as much money as they wanted.Lord Rhondda telegraphed his hope that the men would continue fishing until the matter had been discussed ; and thereupon the Director of Fish Supplies visited Yarmouth, accompanied by tho Secretary of the Fishery Board lor Scotland, and attended a meeting of some 75 Scottish skippers, at which, after the importance from a food of view of continuing fishing operations had been explained, they unanimously-passed a resolution expressing their intention of remaining till the end of the fishery season.
yeat._Preliminary instructions have been issued to Local Food Control Com-mittecs as to the proposed Order for the registration of all persons connected with the meat trade (e.(j., wholesalers, retailers, slaughterhouse keepers, &amp;c).Through Local Food Control Committees, forms (M.C. 8) have been sent to butchers on which detailed returns are to be made as to the meat bought and sold by them in the four weeks ending 27th October. Forms (M.C. 8a) have also been sent to Local &quot;rood Control Committees on which these butchers&apos; returns may be tabulated. \n explanatory circular (M.G. Meat Control 1) accompanies the Form M.C. 8a.Milk. In two instances Local Food Control Committes have been given power to requisition milk in their areas, owing to diversion of supplies, since 7th October 1917, to other areas. It is hoped shortly to give all Local Food Control Committees power to requisition milk produced in their area or brought in by road.Oils and Fats. The Margarine (Maximum Prices) Order, 1017, has been issued and will come into force on 26th November 1917 ; the wholesale price of margarine has been fixed at lOd. per lb., except that &quot; Oleo Margarine&quot; may be sold at Is. 2d. per lb.   The corresponding maximum retail prices are Is. and Is. Ad. per lb.The Oil Splitting Order has been issued and has been in force since 12th Novem-ber; it provides that, except for purposes of soap manufacture, a licence must be olilained from the Food Controller beiore splitting cocoanut oil, cotton oil, gingelly (sesame] seed, ground nut oil, soya oil, kapok-seed oil, Nigerseed oil, palm kernel oil, or rapeseed oil, or any of the acid oils arising from refining any of these oils into their component parts of fatty acid and glycerine.Oil Seeds. The imports of oils and oil seeds up to 30th September this year amounted to -137,000 tons as against 590,000 tons in 19L6 ; this amount is considerably below the requirements for the manufacture of glycerine, margarine, and other essential purposes. Full particulars of the freight room required have been placed before the Ministry of Shipping, but negotiations have not yet been concluded.Potatoes, &amp;c. The Seed Potatoes (L917 Crop) Order was signed on the 12th instant. This Order fixes maximum prices at which growers may sell seed potatoes, and limits the profits of wholesale and retail dealers.Details of the new scheme for the compensation of growers who sell potatoes at less than 07. per ton are being worked out, and the whole scheme should be ready for issue before the end of the week.Arrangements are being pressed forward to make considerable purchases of potatoes by the Ministry with two objects :--(a) To conserve those potatoes which will keep until the end of the season.(6) To supply bakers with potatoes at a cheap rate for incorporating in bread.The question of the supply and control of onions is being actively considered, and a scheme for the purchase and distribution by the Ministry of Dutch and possibly Spanish onions is being evolved.Sugar. No further losses have been incurred.Arrangements have been completed for making payment for the Dutch sugar placed at our disposal under the agreement for restriction of grocery supplies, and delivery has been accepted.The negotiations for establishment of a Sugar Fxecutive have been brought to a satisfactory, conclusion, and the. agreement has been signed on behalf oi: the several Governments to be represented on it. It is proposed that America should be invited to join in the agreement and to appoint a representative on the Committee, and a cablegram has been sent to Mr. Hoover in this sense.Dr. Alouzo Taylor, of the American Mission, attended the weekly meeting of the Sugar Commission on 13th November, and the sugar situation in U.S.A., and generally, was very fully discussed. A very satisfactory coincidence of view on all important points was apparent.Tea. ISiegotiations for buying tea on Government account in India and Ceylon are making satisfactory progress and should shortly be concluded.It is considered desirable that a certain quantity of first-class China tea should be imported into the United Kingdom and arrangements are being made accordingly.Sanction has been obtained for proceeding with the provision of warehouse accommodation in Manchester.The quantity of tea available in November should be at least 60 per cent, of a month&apos;s normal consumption, and in December at least 40 per cent. The amount available in January 1918 may be 50 per cent, or more.
AFood Economy.Sir Arthur Yapp, at a meeting of the Manchester Food Control Committee on November 12th, announced a new scale of voluntary rations. He added the warning that the strictest economy should be practised in the use of the staple food, and that the rations should on no account be exceeded.   The new scale is as follows : Bread. Weekly Ration.	lb.	oz.Men on heavy industrial work or agricultural work	8	f)Men on ordinary industrial or other manual work	7	0Men unoccupied or on sedentary work     -	.4	8Women on heavy industrial work or on agricultural work	5	0Women on ordinary industrial  work  or  in  domestic		service -------	4	0Women unoccupied or on sedentary work -	3	8Other Foods (for all Adults).		Cereals other than bread -----	0	12Meat        -------	2	0Butter, margarine, lard, oils, and fats      -	0	10Suerar       -------	0	8No rations are prescribed for children, who are to receive a reasonable share of staple articles of food.Cereals. The &quot;bread&quot; rations include all flour, whether used for bread or for cooking. Flour may be taken instead of bread at the rate of f-lb. of flour for every pound of bread. The &quot;other cereal&quot; rations include oatmeal, rice, tapioca, sago, barley, meal, cornflour, maize meal, dried peas, beans, and lenlils, and ail cereal products except bread and flour. The weight given is the weight of the dry article as bought. If the full bread ration is not used the amount saved can be taken in other cereals at the rate of f-lb. of cereals for every pound of bread saved.Meat. The &quot; meat &quot; rations include the average amount of bone, which may be taken as one-quarter of the weight of the actual meat. Any parts of meat (such as rump steak, bacon, or suet) which are bought without bone must count for one-quarter more than their actual weight. On the other hand, any bone in excess of a quarter of the actual meat bought may be deducted. Poultry and rabbits may be counted at half their actual weight.   The meat rations include suet.Exchange of Bread and Meat. -Any person may take half a pound of meat over and above his meat ration in exchange for hall&apos; a pound of bread to be deducted from his bread ration. Similarly any person may take half a pound extra of bread in exchange for meat.Other Foods.-The consumption of milk and cheese must be restricted as far as possible. These foods should be reserved for persons for whom th03&apos; are indispensable. A more extensive.use should bo made of fresh vegetables and fruit, and in particular of potatoes, which are not rationed. This season^ excellent potato crop supplies the means of observing the prescribed rations without privation, and it must not be wasted.Enforcement of Orders.Potatoes. Convictions have been obtained in several big cases under the Potato Orders. At Chatteris, in Cambridgeshire, Horace Taylor was. convicted on 11 charges of selling potatoes at excessive prices and was lined 220/,. and 217. costs. Arthur Sole, of A. J. Sole, Ltd., Covent Garden, was lined 1,200/. on 23 charges of selling seed potatoes to retailers in quantities of more than 56 lbs. at prices in excess of those allowed by the Order. George Lec,oi the Borough Market, was fined at Tower Bridge Police Court 350/., and S. Smedley, St. Pancras Market, was fined 200/. and 25/. costs at Clerkenwell Police Court. At Doddington, in Cambridgeshire, G. T. Butcher was fined, on 28 charges, 1,400Z. including costs. In all these cases the preliminary investigations were made and solicitors were instructed direct from the Enforcement Branch.The heavy fines inflicted in these cases will have a good effect upon profiteering generally.
Cake and Pastry Order.-In May 1917, G. A. Ince, a magistrate lor the County of Surrey and trading as T. Keasley &amp; Sons, Reigate, was summoned at the instigation of the Chief Constable for a contravention of tnis Order before the local bench, the charge being dismissed. On further contravention taking place, upon the suggestions of the Chief Constable of Reigate, a solicitor and counsel from London were instructed with its prosecution with the result that G. A. Ince was fined SI. and .10 guineas costs. The defendant has appealed and it is intended to instruct counsel on the Ministry^ behalf.Cereals. Mr. Blomfield, a farmer of Halstead in.Essex, informed Lord Rhondda that he was about to have 200 quarters of barley ground to feed his pigs because he could only obtain 62s. per quarter from the miller, whereas if he sold to the maltster he was entitled to receive 68s. On receipt of this information an inspector was sent down from this branch to investigate the facts and from his report it is quite clear that Mr. Blom field has put his intention into execution and has been feeding the pigs upon this barley. As this gentleman is a man of some standing in his district, he being a J.P., and also a member of the Local Food Committee, a London solicitor has been instructed to prosecute.At the Tower Bridge Police Court on the 31st October, Messrs. Noakes &amp; Co., Brewers, were fined 50/-., for brewing 361 barrels of beer in excess of the allowed maximum.   Other prosecutions for similar breaches are pending.Food Hoarding Order. At the request of the Chief Constable of Northampton, a London solicitor has been instructed to proceed in a serious charge of food hoarding in Towcester. An inspector has ascertained that a large quantity of sugar and tea has been hoarded at 123, Maida Vale, and proceedings are being instituted.With reference to the power of entry referred to under paragraph 3 of the Food Hoarding Order, 1917, a number of cases which have been sent to the Enforcement Branch show there is a distinct tendency to apply for this power upon mere local gossip, without any direct statement showing that there is any &quot;reason to believe that any article of food is being kept in contravention&quot; of the Order. As it is most desirable that this power shall be used with great discretion in order to prevent its abuse, in accordance with the Cabinet undertaking, it is important that authorities to search should only issue from the Ministry direct, in order to secure proper uniformity of action, and to ensure the same being issued only after careful consideration.Food Control Committees.The Enforcement (England and Wales) Order, 1917, dated November 9, 3917, confers on Food Control Committees in England and Wales the power of enforcing the Orders of the Food Controller and prosecuting for offences against them. The existing powers of Local Authorities in this respect will continue in all cases for the present; and provision is made for special cases in which a Local Authority and a food Control Committee agree that the former body should take the chief resrjonsi-bility in the matter.PART II.-SUMMARY OF THE FOOD POSITION.From the accompanying paragraphs and table it will be seen that (1) The imports of tea are more satisfactory. Taken in conjunction with the stocks of coffee and cocoa, and the increased consumption of these, it may be hoped that the period of acute scarcity of tea is coming to an end.(2) There are indications of some decrease in the supplies of cattle sent into the market.(3) Bacon stocks and supplies continue to be low.Imports.^ The aggregate weight of imported principal foods (including tea and ricej was 157,500 tons last week as compared with 133,000 tons the previous week and 143,000 tons the average of the 5 weeks ended November 3rd,   (Table A.)
The improvement is almost entirely in wheat and flour (increase of 47,000 tons) which just reached estimated weekly average requirements of imports for the coming months.   A slight increase in oats and maize is balanced by a decrease in rice.Meat, especially &quot; unenumerated &quot; meat,&apos; fell off and was below average require-ments.2,406 tons of margarine helped to balance the negligible imports of the previous week.About 7,000,000 lbs. of tea arrived. For the third week in succession the importation has been up to normal consumption.The importation of oil seeds in October was 19,500 tons above that in September, but is still below the average for the first 9 months of 1917 or 1910. On the other hand, oil seed cake feel off considerably.Consumption.Meat. At four principal meat markets (Table 13) the supply of home-fed meat Avas the same in the week ended November 3rd as in the previous week. At 59 cattle markets (Table C) the supply of fat cattle in the week ended November 7th was 16 per cent, below the average of October 1917 and 7 per cent, below the supply in the week November 2nd-8th last year.On the other hand the supply of fat sheep was very slightly above the average for October and 15 per cent, higher than last year. The supply of fat pigs was the highest for many weeks and nearly equal to the average of the months from February to May this year. A seasonal increase is to be expected from September to December. The supply was 22 per cent, below that in the corresponding week last year.There was more foreign meat in the markets (Table B) than in the two preceding weeks, but the average for October 1917 was 39 per cent, below that in October 1916.Taking foreign and home-fed meat together (Table B) we find that the supplies in October 1917 were respectively 11 &quot;7 and 10&apos;5 per cent, below the supplies in 1916.Further returns of the animals slaughtered in September 1917 and .1916 (Table D) modify only very slightly the changes shown in last week&apos;s report.Provisions.The returns for October from the principal provision dealers operating multiple shops in the United Kingdom (Table E) show a considerable decrease in the sales of bacon, hams, and cheese as compared with September 1917 or October 1916. The sales of lard and margarine have increased, but not enough to compensate the decrease in butter.Sales in the four weeks ended Sept. 24th, 1917.   Oct. 27th, 1917.rp rpIons. Ions.11.549 10,9361,945 1,5261,653 1,548Butter, margarine, and lard -Bacon and hams  -Cheese -. Prices.Wholesale. The price of English beef fell 2s. per cwt., and of Argentine beef Is. per cwt. as compared with the previous week, and Irish bacon rose 2s. Od. Cheddar cheese rose 2s. Gd.Cotton-seed cake fell 25s. to its price four weeks ago.The retail prices of butter, beans, peas, lentils, rice, sago, tapioca, condensed milk, and lard all rose during October (Table K) while oatmeal fell. The general increase in price of these &quot; subsidiary &quot; foods during the war is considerably greater than that of the more important foods as shown in Table 11. In particular the price of oatmeal had risen from 2d. per lb. in July 1914 to 4%d. in November J917, a rise of 140 per cent., while the wholesale price of British oats had risen only 116 per cent. The statutory maximum price was on November 1st A.\d. in Scotland and 5d. in England ; it has now been reduced IcZ.
Stocks.The stock of wheat fell 427,000 tons from September 1st to November 1st, 1917, while last year the fall was only 286,000 tons in the same period (Table G),&apos; The difference is due to the deficiency of imports discussed in last week&apos;s report.On the other hand the estimated stock of oats fell 458 tons in the two months this year, but 493,000 tons last year, despite the fact that imports were 200,000 tons less ; this shows a considerable decrease in consumption. The consumption of the barley harvest has also been less this year in spite of its use as a diluent. The stock of maize has fallen to 54,000 tons and is little more than half the stock on September 1st.The stocks of butter, margarine, lard, and cheese on November 1st were together ouiy three-quarters of the stock on October 1st, though they were 10 per cent, higher than on November 1st, 1916. The stocks of beef, mutton, &amp;c, were 19,000 tons more, and of bacon and hams 12,000 tons less, than a year ago.The stock of sugar, 221,000 tons, is the highest recorded for 29 months.Of tea the stock has: continued to fall, and on November 1st was only 5i weeks supply.   Of coffee it is the same as last year, and of cocoa 12 per cent, higher.&quot;
