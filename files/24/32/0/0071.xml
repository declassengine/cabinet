Dear Colonel House,

I am instructed by the Prime Minister to invite you to meet the War Cabinet and certain other members of His Majesty&apos;s Government, on Tuesday next, November 20, 1917, at 10 Downing Street, at 11-30 a,m., when it is hoped to have a full discussion of the question of the co-operation of the United States of America in this War, and the nature of the assistance that they can render to Great Britain and her Allios.

The Prime Minister hopes that you will bring with you such other members of your Mission whose presence you consider desirable.

I shall be glad if you will kindly furnish me, at your early convenience, with a list of those who will accompany you.

As regards the secretarial arrangements, neither the War Cabinet nor the Inter-Allied Conferences usually keep stone-graphic notes, although I always prepare a ? of the discussions and circulate it to those concerned, first for remarks, and, when final agreement has been reached, for record. If, however you would prefer to have a stonegraphic record, I will certainly arrange for it.

Yours very truly,

Colonel Edward M. House,

The President of the United States,
