twtk TflOUMEMT IS THE PROPERTY 03? HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY * S GOVEBMOagT)SECRET O^l/l31/376. G.T. 2613.40THE SITUATION IN ITALY.1.      It has been decided that we should give such direct military assistance to Italy as will help her to stem invasion and afford her time and opportunity to restore her Armies to an efficient condition,  and that this assistance is for the present to take first place in our military policy.   I do not question this decision -indeed. I fully agree with it for the time being - but I feel that the War Cabinet would wish to be informed as to its possible consequence and effect upon the future.2.     Russia was defeated by Germany in 1915,  and after that year ceased to be a serious menace to her.    It is true that in 1916 Brusiloff carried out a successful attack on the South-Western portion of the Russian Front, but this success was due less to the offensive power of the Russsians than to the weakness of Austria and the demoralisation of her troops, and the defective administrative services of Russia which prevented Brusiloff from following up his success,  plus the arrival of a few .German divisions,  quickly brought the Russians to a stand-still,2.     Italy now appears to be in a position somewhat similar to that of Russia in 1915.    She has suffered a great disaster ,  and the extent to which she will be able to recover from it is very doubtful.    It would be idle to rely on any offensive effort by the Italian   Armies this Winter, and while the events of the next critical ten days or fortnight may enable us to forecast the future more accurately,  it is by no means certain at present that we shall be able to keep Italy inthe
-2-the War.   Pour French and four British divisions, with a suitable proportion of heavy artillery and aircraft,  are now in or on their way to Italy, and two more British divisions are &quot;being prepared to follow, if necessary.   The French have, I understand, also prepared two more divisions.   We cannot say yet whether all these divisions will be required, or whether, if sent, they will be sufficient to check the enemy * 8 progress and   ,enable the Italian Army to reform and reorganise-If, as is not likely, the Italian Armies again collapse, it will be doubtful whether anything which we and the French can possibly do will restore the situation,  and the question will then arise whether we shall be justified in continuing to throw good money after bad.4.     I assume that our real object in sending troops to Italy is not merely to defend her but to make her Army into an effective force capable of assisting us to win the War. The Italian situation must, therefore, be watched most closely and we must at all costs avoid the danger of ruining ourselves in the attempt to assist an Ally who can never help us in return.   To take the most favourable result,  and assuming that the divisions now on the way succeed in restoring the situation, we must still expect to find in the future that Italy will he as dependent upon us as Austria is upon Germany, and that for the remainder of the War French and British troops will be required on the Italian front.   This means that we shall have&quot;an additional burden to carry.    If we eventually send,  say,  as many as eight British divisions to Italy,  and France sends the same number,  the effect will then be to weak-en very materially,  and probably to destroy altogether,  our power of offence in France next year, while if more than these 16 are sent it will become necessary to consider seriously the security of the Franco-British lines in France.In
-3-In order to maintain their four divisions in Italy the Freanch have already had to reduce one of their remaining divisions in France,  and if they have heavy losses on the Italian front further reductions will follow.   Their position regarding man-power before the Italian collapse was such that they calculate they would have to reduce eight divisions before May next. The demands of Italy may well increase this to ten or twelve divi sions.5.      In the existing uncertainty as to the Russian ^situation we must be prepared to see a considerable number of German divisions from the Russian front come westwards, and a heavy attack delivered on the West front this winter or early next year, perhaps upon the French.    Now,  the French Government is one of the most unstable of any of the Entente Governments, and the effect of an unstable Government upon soldiers in the field has always been,  and always will be, bad. Further,  there are many signs of war weariness in France and of a desire for peace, to say nothing of pacifist and other intrigues.   We cannot afford to shut our eyes to these things, or we may receive the same surprise as in the case of Italy.6,     On the principle of preparing for theworst while we hope for the best, we must accordingly be ready next year to find in France an   Army reduced in numbers and shaken bya heavy enemy attack;  an even weaker Government than now, exists; and the War supported by popular opinion to a much less extent than it now is.   Therefore we must be ready to support yet another Ally,  and to discover that we and America are the only stable and determined members of the Entente, Even our stability may be in question, for, if, with France shaky, and owing to our detachments to the Italiantheatre,

S.War Office, 14/11/17.-4-theatre. to our losses there, and to the lack of opportunity for training and resting the troops not sent, we are thrown on the defensive in the West,  the power and spirit of our own Armies will certainly deteriorate.   No Army is able to stand the strain of a prolonged defensive and keep its military spirit unimpaired.7,     All this means that the present situation in Italy requires very careful handling,  and that we may have to consider the question of cutting our losses if the task of saving, not merely Italy, but the Italian Army,  seems likely to be beyond our powers.   I also earnestly urge upon the War Cabinet that we should prepare at once for the increased burden which we shall have to bear, whether Italy is kept in the War or whether she goes out of it.    I submit that we should immediately closely and carefully go into our remaining resources in man-power and find out definitely what can,  by a supreme effort, be made available.
