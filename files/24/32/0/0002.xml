-Intelligence Bureau,SECRET.Department *f Information. GSW/OOS.THenew Ministry and Political Situation.*\ Weekly Report on Sweden. . 11*(Nov. 13th,  1917)The recent General Elections made it evident that the Con-servative Party would he left An considerable minority not only in the lower house but also on the occasions when the Upper andlihe Conservatives to maintain the Swartz-Lindman Cabinet at leastnext 5until the meeting of the new Riksdag in January/ar am an alterna-tive scheme e oh turner they hoped to detach so many Liberals from the block of parties of the Left as would enable a coalition of moderate Liberals and Conservatives to take the plaoe of the Swartz-Lindman Government.     They had a vague hope that the war would end by Christmas in favour of Germany and that the maintenance of the Swartz-Lindman Cabinet would enable them to oontrol the Foreign Policy of Sweden till the conclusion of hostilities.     This desire was largely increased by the fear that the accession of Mr. Branting. the Socialist leader, to power might drive Sweden into the arms of the Entente.     The crushing defeat of the Conservatives at the Polls soon showed Mr. Swaitz that it was vain to hope to remain in office in the face of the verdiot of the country.     The Kingfs endeavour to form a coalition Ministry of the three principal Parties failed and His Majesty was compelled to send for Professor Eden and Mr. Branting, the leaders of the Liberals and Socialists. Some time elapsed before   these politicians could agree on the number of members each party would have in the Cabinet, but eventually the Socialists obtained four eeat3 out of eleven.Lower Houses vote together.This led to an effart tn the part of
Mr. Hellner, the new Minister of Foreign Affairs, was the principalSwedish delegate during the negotiations which took place in Bondonin 1916.     It is stated on good authority that the King of Swedenput great pressure on him to accept office as he is generally con-sidered a moderate and safe man, who has not compromised himselfby public utterances criticising either of the belligerent groups.theIt is hardly necessary to say that/appointment of four socialists to the Ministry - among them Mr. Branting as Minister of Finance - has been received in Conservative circles with extreme hostility and dees not s^pear to be particularly welcome even to the Liberals.     The outlook of the Coalition Government is indeed not very encouraging; but it is probable that the majority of the nation is alive to the difficult position the Ministry is in owing to the abnormal times. It is clear to nearly everyone that the entrance into the war of the United States has profoundly modified the Blockade question and that the new Ministry cannot be expected to perform miracles in the way of persuading Great Britain and America to permit Sweden alone to import food-stuff and raw material.Argrntine Cable Scandal.M.Majesty&apos;s Minister at Stockholm has, unofficially, addressed a memorandum to the Swedish Government drawing attention to this and other serious breaches of neutrality on their part.Aland Islands.The presence of the German fleet in the Eastern Baltic and the taking of   Riga has not unnaturally drawn the attention of the pub-lie in Sweden to the Aland Islands question which is considered of vital importance dso the country.     The &quot;Goteborgs Aftonbladet&quot;, in an article on Out, 23 last says that if the Aland Islands were to
become a Gibraltar in the hands of a foreign power SwedisH interests would he so directly threatened that passivity would have to he abandoned.     Such a crisis had been threatened on more than one occasion since the outbreak of war, once when Russia fortified the Islands and again when, after the Revolution,  it was discovered that the English had plans for occupying the islands.   At present the Germans were taking the initiative in the Baltic and perhaps the Finns would welcome a landing in Finland.     This would not be com-patible with Swedish interests.     By hitherto abstaining from any blow directed at Finland or the Aland Islands Germany had recognised that the initiative in those regions belonged to Sweden.     If she modified her policy it would be because she believed that Sweden had abandoned the desire to play the cultural and historic role which was her right.     A German supremacy in the Baltic would indeed bgr preferable to Russian control but it would wound Swedish self-re-s-pect and would involve her interests in future dangers.     For Sweden to remain passive at such a time would be to risk the ruin of her national aims.The activist&quot;ttya Dagligt ; llehanda&quot;(Oct. 25) suggests that Sweden, with the consent of Germany and Russia should occupy the Aland Islands.The Blockade.The pro-German press continues to attack Great Britain;    their view being as follows:-   The declaration of blockade policy by the United States is what was to be expected.     England is now eneoura-ging America to do what she. has, for a variety of reasons, hitherto hesitated to do sw herself.     The obvious intention of the Entente is to force Sweden to cut off all commercial relations with Germany;   but it is clear that neutrality compels Sweden to maintain
trade with both belligerents.      If Sweden were to yield to the pressure of the Entente reprisals from Germany must be expected and her geographical position would render such reprisals very effective. Sweden is dependent for her coal supply on Germany, that is, she cannot continue her exports of steel and iron without the necessary fuel.     In these circumstances it is for Professor Eden&apos;s Government to make good their recent declaration of strict neutrality and insist on Sweden&apos;s right to trade with the Central Powers.Scandinavian Trade Conference September 1917.This meeting was attended by twenty-five prominent delegates from each of the three Scandinavian States.   The general impression produced by the conference was that trade citcles have become strongly convinced that the international position,and especially the economic struggle to be expected after the war, rendered it highly desireable that there should be close economic co-operation between the Scandinavian countries.   There was considerable dis-cussion as to the best method of obtaining co-operation.     The most practical method was considered to be Scandinavian Commercial Treaties with definite maximum t^a)iffs and mutnal concessions in the form of reduction of customs duties, in fact a system of preference. The whole question was admitted to present great difficulties. These, it was hoped, could be solved by s^arate committees from the States interested and finally by a joint Committee representing all Scandinavians.     AnDther important question discussed was the position of foreigners as regards the concession laws in Sweden and Norway.     These laws were admitted to be too rigorous and it wassuggested that they should be modified so far as they stood in theway/of Scandinavian reciprocity.   Another point raised was the   Scandi-navdan monetary union and it was decided, after the war, to under-take further constructive work on the foundation of common interest which formed the basis of the Northern Coinage Union.
