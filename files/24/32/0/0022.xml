ilia document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty1 s Government).SECRETG.T. 2623. WAR CABINET.SITUATION IN ITALY.(Copy of telegram from General Delme Radcliffe to the C.I.G.S.y.675   November 14th.Secret and Personal from General wilson for the infor-mation of War Cabinet.W 105 Novemter 14th.     Last night Diaz sent me a paper evidently drawn up by Porro, spying that if the present line was held he would require a total reinforcement of 20 Divisions, of which 10 French and 10 British and a large number of Guns and that if he fell back to&apos; the Mincio-Po line, he would require ?even more, as in that case he estimated that there would be only 6 Italian Divisions still available to fight.     In short he proposes that if a retirement to the Mincio takes place that the British and French shall take over defence of Italy.   I quote this paper which is much more a mathematical treatise than a military paper to show you the trend of mind at this Headquarters, My own opinion is that Mincio line will require less troops (British and French) than the present line, and I also think that, if the present line is not held, then having lost Venice, the shorter line we take up the better.     The outlook to-day Is not bo good, and partly because our railway concentration is much slower than Italians anticipated, partly because the areas south east of Vicenza are still congested, Plumer cannot get his two leading divisions to his concentration area south of Vicenza before about November 25th.     This will have a depressing effect on the Italians.     In addition situation in front remains uncertain.   Austrian lodgment at Zenson is increasing in strength, though not yet serious, and pressure all along line of river and in mountains appears also to be increasing; but although situation Is not quite so good, there is nothing serious in the change.     General Foch has asked for 2 more divisions, making total of 6.     As no advantage is gained by deciding for next few days, I propose to wait further develop-ments before advising.
