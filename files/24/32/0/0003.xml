(Tim Document is the Property ofHis Britannic Majesty^ Government.)SECRET.Intelligence Bureau,Department of Information.C 10.I0RANDUM ON SITUATION IN FINLAND.(12 November, 1917).Finnish Pro-German Leanings.When the war broke out, large sections of the Finnish population desired to sink all differences &quot;both amongst themselves and with Russia and give her their whole-hearted support.     This support was declined, and as there was no modification of policy under the old regime, the first natural enthusiasm died away and was replaced by quite other feelings, the more so that Russia was allied with Powers who were supposedly fighting for the protection of small nations,     Germany was very quick to take advantage of the situation.     An article in the Ryetch of July 13, 1917, gave many details about a secret society founded in 1915 in Finland to work for the separation of Finland from Russia with the help of Germany.   With the help of Swedish sympathisers and under the direction of bureaus established in Helsingfors and Stockholm, a regular passage of Young Finns was maintained from Finland to a camp near Hamburg (Lokstadt) to be trained for service with the German army in case of a descent on Finland,     Up to June 1916 some 2,000 Finns had been in training in this camp, to whom a plan of action in connection with such a landing was unfolded.   A certain proportion of them were sent back to Finland with a view to instructing their fellow-countrymen, and after the Revolution the return of these trained men took place on a larger scale than ever. Again, the continuation of the repressive policy of the Old Regime created considerable uneasiness in Sweden in the early stages of the war, as it seemed to indicate the possibility of subsequent
aggression from Russia.     It is stated that when Baron Palmstierna (Minister of Marine in the Swedish Cabinet) visited England and made representations (&quot;perhaps more cut of egotistic patriotic motives than anything else&quot;) on the unanimity of Swedish feeling en the necessity of doing something to put an end to the Russian policy in Finland, the proposal was put on one side with a remark to the effect that it was a very small matter.     This was, of course transmitted to Finland and was held to be an indication that the Allies approved of the Russian policy in Finland, with the result that feeling cooled considerably towards them.     As an Old Finn, Mr Rantakari, in the &quot;Uusi Aura&quot;, puts it, when endeavouring to go to the root of the Pro-German feeling in some quarters, -&quot;from that country they had received the Protestant religion; through that language they had, directly or indirectly, participated in the fruits of the progress of the world;   in that country reignec1 order and organisation which compared favourably with the existing order in Finland and in Russia&quot;.-     All this, to which must be added the disbelief in the sincerity of the Allies&apos; desires for the &quot;protection of the small nations&quot; caused, this writer asserts, a certain kind of sympathy with Germany, although he adds, &quot;Y^e have concluded peace and come to an understanding with the Hew Russia, which we mean to keep&quot;.Finland and the Revolution of Ko.rch^lj?!1?.Almost the first act of the Provisional Government was to withdraw from Finland the representatives of the past oppression and give back to the country most of the rights that it had lost. Indeed, Finland was treated more handsomely in speech and on paper than even most of the Finnish leaders expected.   There was, however considerably delay in getting anything done, and with the growing
disorders in Russia Jta. 3^3 Finns became uncertain of the ability of the Provisional Government to carry out their premises.     There also developed a natural instinct to cut ?Lo3se from the general Russian confusion which might, it was felt, eventually lead to a counter-revolution, nor could anybody  tfellwhen a wave of nationalism might not again sweep $ver the Russian people to the detriment of their newly promised liberties.     Accordingly the Socialists in particular agitated for immediate independence of action along the lines of complete self-government.     The extreme character of the proposals, and the circumstance that the Diet violated the Fundamental Laws in not submitting the bill proclaiming the independence of Finland to the Provisional Government inevitably led to the dissolution of the Diet on July 25th.     In the Diet the Social Democrats, owing to some technicalities of the Finnish proportionate voting system, actually held 104 out of 200 seats, although only entitled to 47^ of the number, and it was by the unscrupulous use of the majority that this extreme measure was passed.     The Socialists attempted to declare ths dissolution illegal, although no support for such a line of action could be found in the laws regulating the Diet, and even went the length of convening it for August 29th;   Further recognition of t&apos;-eir blunder led to an attempt to explain that the offending Bill contained no measure aiming at the complete independence of Finland.     This conscious weakening,  together with a show of firmness cn the part of the Provisional Government in intimating its intention of resisting any attempt to hold the Diet, diverted the Social Democrats to the more reasonable task of preparing for the new election ordered by the Provisional Government.     It should be stated, however, thatfinding the House of the Diet occupied by troops on the morning of1August 29th, the Speaker summoned the Diet to meet in the Old House. Some 73 members, mostly Socialist, attended to listen to his protest:
the leaders of the other parties took the line that the Diet should accept the situation and disperse.The official Russian point of view at this stage may he gathered from an interview given by Mr Stackovitch, the first Governor-General elected after the Revolution, to the Russian newspaper Den. in which he said, amongst other things:    &quot;The proposed widening of Finnish autonomy is directed by the Pro-visional Government towards enlarging the powers of the Senate. The Provisional Government proposes to introduce a Bill in the new Diet which will confer all the rights of the Monarch with regard to internal questions on the Senate.   This shows the benevolent view which the Provisional Government adopts towards Finland.   The programme can not, however, be carried out before the Constituent Assembly is convoked.    All the parties in Finland cherish the idea of full autonomy.    The difference between the Eourgeois and the Socialist parties is that the former endeavour to carry this idea through by legal means&quot;.     In his opinion the Russian sailors in Finland, about whom he was much perturbed, were altogether in the hands of the Bolsheviks.   Some of the troops in Finland, more particularly in the northern part, created hostility against themselves through their behaviour.   This testimony as coming from a Russian, a former Cadet and well-known Zemstvo leader, who has been a very much respected Governor-General, must be considered decisive.The unfortunate results of the Korniloff episode were seenin Finland as manifestly as in other parts of the State.   The localRussian Workmen&apos;s and Soldiers1 Committees, together with theShips&apos; Committee and Peasants&apos; Committee, held a conjoint meetingon September 10 at which a resolution was framed declaringfPGeneral Kornilow to be a counter-revolutionary, supported by
the counter-revolutionary bourgeois parties, nwho with arms in thetr hands had revolted against the  evolution.     All the power in the State must therefore be trasnferred to the revolutionary democracy, and Korniloff and his partisans be declared traitors.     All bourgeois papers must be stepped.     Amongst the members of the above Committees a Revolutionary Committee was elected with unlimited power to prevent such counter-revdlutionary movements and uphold order.     It was also decided that the various Government offices must be Kept under supervision,and a Mr. Antonov, a member of the Executive Committee, was appointed Commissary to the Governor-General in Finland.     His task was to keep his eyes on the activities of the said Governor-General, and examine all in-going and out-going papers.On Sept, 12 an Open Letter was addressed by the Provisional Goveroment to the Senate g  the final settlement of some questions by the Senate, in which it was intimated that &quot;as far as the Finnish Fundamental Laws and other Laws passed by the consent of the Diet allow, such affairs as have hitherto been decided by the Emperor and Grand-Duke alone, without the consent of the Diet, will in future be decided by the Economical Department of the Senate&quot;, with certain exceptions.     Of these the principal were:   all matters relating to the convocation etc, of the Diet;   the decision a.s to when new elections shell take place;   all matters connected with the proposal and passing of new legislation by the Diet;   the appointment of the Governor-General and his Deputy,  , the Minister-Secretary of State, the Vice-President and Members of the Senate, the Procurator and the Staff of the Governor-General&apos;s Chancery;    the decision of such affairs as ooncern the legal relations between Russia and Finland.&quot;If when the Senate arrived at its decision&quot;,the letter   con-tinued, &quot;the Governor-General was not present, his opinion is to be
obtained.     If the Governor General does not agree with the decision of the Senate or else considers the matter of grefct importance, it has to be submitted to the Higher Government.&quot;The Provisional Government reiterates its firm intention of bringing before the Diet a proposition about the way in which internal Finnish affaira will have to be settled in the future&quot;.This Open Letter was welcomed as &quot;a step in the right direction&quot;, although in itself &quot;an incomplete measure&quot; by the Finnish press other than Socialist. The Election Campaign.One feature of the election campaign was the formation of a blocof the non-Socialist parties, with the exception of the Agrarianparty.   Of these the principal are the Old Finns, the Young Finns,and the Swedish  arty.     Their principal organs are &quot;Uusi Suometar&quot;(New Daughter of Finland), &quot;Helsingin Sanomat&quot;   (Helftingfars News),and &quot;Hufvudstadsbladet&quot;   (Metropolitan Gazette)   respectively:   thatof the Socialists is called &quot;Tyomies&quot;(Labourer).     The Old Finns andthe Young Finns hold that the Finnish people, while endeavouringto obtain as large a degree of autonomy as possible, must direct theiroJkmain efforts to the confirm&amp;gion and development of their freedomand the immediate realisation of their right to manage their ownaffairs.     The Swedish Nationalist Party is coimosed of the oldgoverning clasBes but also includes small holders, working men,fisherman and farm labourers.     Its members are Swedish-speaking,but without any other desire to be united to Sweden.     It has on itsthatprogramme, Autonomy, Law, and Order.     It deolares/Finland as an autonomous State must obtain a place among the Sovereign nations; that the power in the S ate belongs to the people of Finland;    that whiibe the Government has to have power to protect the people against
lawlessness and disorder, it is itself responsible to the Diet. It also holds that the legislative power of the Diet must be enlarged so as to embrace also the spheres of Economic and. Customs Law.     The Agrarian party is the party of the small land-owners. The leading points on the Election programmes, however, dealt with two main subjects - the protection of Finnish self-government and the reintroduction of order in the community with a view to its peaceful development-Result of the Elections.The final figures show the allocation of seats to have been as follows:-Bourgeois bloc. 61.Swedish Party. 21.Social-Democrats. 92.Agrarians. 26.200.From these data it is apparent that the Socialists suffered a defeat, the number of their seats being reduced from 103 to 92. The majority believe that this defeat would have been heavier if it had not been for the ignorance of the poorer classes, who proved very susceptible to flattery and false promisee; they are consequently initiating a campaign for the political education of the electorate.     As the result now stande, the Socialists are in the minority and the bourgeois elements have the majority.    The Agrarians, the number of whose representatives rose from 19 to 26, were largely led by the Socialists in the Old Diet, &quot;but now appear more disposed to side with the Bourgeois party.One circumstance that has had a good deal to do with strengthening the understanding between the Bourgeois parties is the discovery of a somewhat sinister plan on the part of the
I t9 V8.socialists to attempt to achieve by force what they have failed to rain by argument.   Certain local Finnish &quot;Corps of Protection&quot; have been publicly formed for the purpose of keeping order and protecting the community from riots and lawlessness.   According to the rules which were confirmed by the Senate, these Corps consist of law-abiding citizens, belonging to any class or party, who are anxious to upholdlaw and order in the community.   These Corps do not act on their own initiative, but are called out when the institutions for keeping order in the State or the Community require their aid. The &quot;Guards on Military Footing&quot;, on the other hand, have been secretly organised by the Socialists and provided with arms with quite another purpose.   It was frankly admitted by the Socialist paper &quot;The Working Youth&quot; that they had been formed with a view to the fact &quot;that the class-struggle has developed to such a degree that it can only be continued by force, and if required even by arms&quot;.   The paper adds that such violence in the first place is to be used against estate-proprietors and merchants.    Individual members of the Socialist Party hinted in election speeches on several occasions at the possibility of their party having to use force to carry   out their policy, should they fail to secure a majority in the Diet.As it is, however, the Bourgeois Party hold the majority, and their point of view on the all-important question of autonomy and relationship to Russia may be. understood from the following extract of a speech by Professor J.R. Danielson-Kalmari, who was a member of the Committee of the Senate which worked out the original Finnish proposals according to the March Programme, for submission to the Diet.       He said:-&quot;The Committee has thought that the relations between&apos; Russia and Finland would have to be laid down in an Act,
which would have both in Finland and in Russia the force of a Fundamental Law, and which would have to be passed in bothcountries in the way the Fundamental Laws are pasBed......   ThisAct ought to contain what is important to Russia in this union with Finland, and also give to Finland the right of an absolute internal independence through which Finland can order its own affairs according to its requirements and national spirit. Finland would have to leave in the handB of Russia foreign affairs and questions of War and Peace.     This would not, however, prevent Finland from having a voice in foreign questions relating to commerce, and generally in such questions, as well as in matters of a cultural nature, Finland would have the right to appear as equal to other sovereign nations enjoying full independence.     As the task of Finland, through her geographical position with regard to Russia, would be to afford the Russian capital and the Russian Western frontier a certain kind of security, Russia would have the right to use her military forces in Finland during war to meet the operations of the enemy from this side, the Finnish troops being then placed at the disposal of the Russian Head-quarters, on the condition, however, of not being moved outside the frontiers of Finland without the consent of the representatives of the Finnish people.     In time of peace the Finnish Army and other military matters v/ould be absolutely under the rule of the Home Military Authorities.     Questions involving the rights of Russian citizens in Finland, commercial relations, railway questions and other mutual matters would be dealt with by specially appointed committees.     Should agreement not be reached there, the decision could be submitted to the Hague Tribunal. To this Tribunal for final decision would also be submitted any interpretations of the above referred to Act in dispute, which would givettLe mutual relations between Russia and Finland a con-siderable stability.
m&quot;The form of government in Finland would have to be worked out by the Diet and the Institution which has the supreme power in Finland, without the interference of the Russian Constituent Assembly.     As long as Russia would remain a Republic the form of government could in Finland also be only republican.     At the head of the government would be a President, elected indirectly, viz. by specially elected electors by the Diet, for a period of, say, six years.     He would have the veto as to the laws passed by the Diet, but his veto would remain in force only until the people through new elections have had opportunity to give expression to its will.&quot;The President would rule the country and appoint either men or women to. the highest functions in the State. At the side of the President would be a Council (correspond-ing to the present Economical Department of the Senate) of Ministers, who would have to enjoy the confidence of the Diet.     Should this he lacking on any question, the President would have the right to dissolve the Diet and call for new elections.     If this resulted in no modification of opinion, the Council would then need to be reconstituted in accordance with the feeling of the country. n** * * . * .. . * ..Meanwhile the internal economic situation has been far from good, and the local relations between Russians and Finns have become very embittered.     The Helsingfors (Russian) Workmen&apos;s and Soldiers&apos; Council decided that while the dissolution of the Diet was in harmony with democratic principles, still they would not interfere in the question.     The Russian Revolutionary Socialist party in Helsingfors issued a proclamation that while the Russian revolutionary democracy bad recognised the principle of the self-
determination and complete self-government in Finland, nevertheless the question would he finally settled at the Constituent Assembly: they therefore also kept apart.     On the other hand the lack of discipline amongst the Russian troops showed itself in an in-creasing tale of excesses, - robberies, assaults, wanton arrest of local authorities, unlawful seizing of spirits and alcohol, -forcible and unauthorised billeting, and brutal murders of officers. In a speech delivered about this time (Sept.2) the Governor-General referred to the grave economic position - the lack of work and threatened shortage of provisions.     It was suggested that the lack of employment might be met by setting people to work on breaking up new land in the country.     It was also hoped to combat the lack of provisions by making all those inhabitants of HelBingfors who were not inevitably compelled to remain there leave for other places where the supply would be. more plentiful. Efforts were also made, though unsuccessfully, to obtain corn from Russia and permission was obtained to import 60,000 tons of wheat from America for Finland.     Such a procedure, although probably Impracticable, is evidence of the determination of the Finns to go their own way.    So also is the proposal to intro-duce new postage stamps for Finland for foreign correspondence from January 1, 1918.12.11.17
