MEMORANDUM ON WAR MUNITION VOLUNTEER

SCHEME IN ITS APPLICATION TO ADMIRALTY ESTABLISHMENTS

BY SIR LYNDEN MACASSEY 31.10.17.

1. The Ministry of Munitions in June 1915 acting in conjunction with the National Advisory Committee on war output, which consisted of trades unionists, evolved a War Munition Volunteer Scheme under Section 6 of the Munitions of War Act 1915. At that time the Ministry of Munitions was the only Department administering labour engaged in private firms on munitions work.

2. In course of time the free action of the Ministry of Munitions to enrol as War Munition Volunteers men who were engaged upon Admiralty work and to transfer War Munition Volunteers from Admiralty work to Ministry work and vice versa, was restricted by a number of Agreements.

The position at the present time is this :-

The Ministry of Munitions may not, under any circumstances, transfer any War Munition Volunteers from Admiralty firms which are Ship-building, Ship-repairing or Marine Engine-ring, to firms not Ship-building, or Ship-repairing or Marine Engineering, nor without the consent of the Admiralty, from any Admiralty work in any Admiralty firm to munitions work in the same firm or elsewhere. In other words, all War Munition Volunteers engaged in Admiralty firms form a separate pool of labour by themselves. The Admiralty are entitled, without any reference to the Ministry, to transfer war Munition Volunteers engaged on Admiralty work between firms engaged in Ship-building, Ship-repairing and Marine Engineering Establishments within a district and to apply to the ministry to transfer such War Munition Volunteers when the transfer is from one district to another. Further, the Ministry are not entitled to transfer War Munition Volunteers actually engaged upon Admiralty work in Ministry firms from that work without the consent of the Admiralty.

The Ministry, like the Admiralty, are vitally interested in production and consequently the two departments are in direct competition with each other for the limited supply of labour at present available.

4. The War Workers Volunteer System which is closely akin to the War Munition Volunteer System, both as regards the duties and terms of service of the individuals enrolled, has been placed under the Administration of the Ministry of National Service. Under present conditions
(SIGHED). IiYNDSN MACASSEYo 31/10/17, DcSoL,conditions the same men can bo enrolled under both schemes, and can thus be under the administration of two departments.   It would make for efficiency, reduce the chances of friction between the throe Deportments, and be more in accord with the general scheme of admihistra-tion new sanctioned by the v/ar Cabinet if the aolministra-tion cf the war munition Volunteer Scheme wore now vested in the ministry of National Service.
