Mth regard to paragraph 3 of your letter under reply, the Council in the time at their disposal have not been able to fully consider whether the suggested provision empowering the military Commander-in-Chief in a theatre of war to convene and confirm General Courts-Martial will meet the case from their point of view, and thoy therefore reserve to themselves tho right to press for an amendment to the Bill during its passage through the House should this be found necessary to secure the object which they have in view.3.

AIH ORGAN-IS ATI PIT COMMITTEEContinuation of correspondence with the War Office concerning, the Air Force Bill.5/Bills/l494 (0.3.) 14th November 1917.Sir,In continuation of War Office letter of the above number dated the 9th instant, relating to the draft Air Force Bill, I am commanded by the Army Oouncil to acquaint you, for the information of the Chairman of the Air Organisation Committee, that they have further considered the provision   in the Bill empowering the military Commander-in-Chief in a theatre of. war.to convene and&apos;confirm General Courts-Martial for the trial of persons subject to Air Force Law and they are not satisfied that this provision would operate satisfactorily.. The effect of the Bill a3 it stands at present is that,, in the case of a body of the Air Force       ;Lng with a body of the Army, the members oi&apos; each remain under their respective systems of law.     The Council adhere to their opinion that there should be mutual powers in the Army and Air Councils to place their forces.under Air Force and Military Law respectively by some provision analogous to the Naval Forces (Service on Shore) Act, under which, . e.g. the Royal IT aval Division is at present serving in France.     The Council understand that this point has been conceded in the case of the Navy and that Air Force on a ship will be subject to naval discipline.     They desire therefore to press for an amendment to be made to the Bill during its passage through the House to meet their views and they would be vOLad if steps could be taken to introduce a Government amendment to provide for this point.I am,. Sir,Your obedient Servant,(Signed)   R.H.Brade.Secretary,Offices of the War Cabinet Whitehall Gardens, S.V\ (1)II.The Air Organisation Committee, on 15th November considered the letter of the Army Council dated 14th November,,, in which the Council proposed that provision should be made in the Air Force Bill for the Air Council to. place Air Forces serving with the Army under Military Law.
The Committee considered that it would oe undesir-ible to t)laoe contingents of the Mx Force allotted to the t aWv in a theatre of war under Military Law. for the followingreasons:(1)   The Air Fo^ce Act has been specially varied from the i\rmv AGt for the puroose of enabling the Air Force authorities to maintain discipline effectively unaer   m the special conditions of air work. i To this end certain new clauses have been added to the Act, constituting new offences which ere peculiar to the Air Forae^and there is no provision under Military Law for dealing with such ofienceso(2)   Air warfare differs materially from land warfare, and there may be circumstances connected with a charge against an Air Officer or man which would make ro undesirable that he should be tried except before a court composed of Air Force officers with experience of air conditions,   Military officers .who have not served in the Royal Flying Dorps would be unable even to understand the to clinical matters which in such a case might very well arisea(3)   The Committee   considering the general similarity, of the Air Act and the Army Act, have nob been aolej to understand exactly what advantage the Army Council expect from this proposal, no specific reasons having been put before tnsmcThe two comparisons made in the letter of the Army Council do not appear to the Committee to have any real bearing on the case*   The Naval Division which has been plased under Military Law has never been really a Naval force, but has actually been separated almost entirely from Admiral by administrati on o   This Division has always been used as a formation for Military purposes, and there appears to be no reason, except a sentimental one. for continuing to call it a Naval Division.   And although uhis Division has been placed under Military Law, other Naval forces serving with the Army in^the Field nave not been so plaoodo   The conditions uader . which^a contingent of the Air Force will be attached to an Army in the Field are in no way analogous to those of thesea,--iw     w k/ujuu. u UOO    i Ugiiil UAJ.O    OUJ.JAJ..I- U I.

The enforcement of a soecial code of discipline on board His MajestyTs ships has always been considered a necessity, and tnere are certain offences which, although trivial onshore, are considered as very grave in a ship. This view is recognised in the provision of a Regulation txiat officers and men of the Army when&apos;serving on board oneThe Committee have also had under consideration the letter of the Army Council dated 9th November, in which &quot;the Council desire to re-affirm their opinion that Anti-Aircraft defence by guns mounted on the land&apos;&apos;or in ships is a branch oi Army or Navy gunnery and should remain part and parcel of land or sea artillery, and they wish it to bo made clear that onerevis no intention to make provision in the Bill for the creation of now units of the Air Force for such purpose&quot;,In
In the Bill tiio Air Council is not limited as to the ozact nature of the forces uhich may be raised under the general term of the Air Forecu   It rrould seem undesirable to make special provision in the Bill to forbid the Air Council to raise Anti-Aircraft units, and a prevision of this kind might hooper future decisions of the&quot;17ar Cabinet..The Director of Military Aeronautics end !jr. Corcoran, the other representative of the War Office on the Committee, do not assent to these viov/s of the Committee.o s t   o t o
in.1. The present position is that the whole Army includ-ihg the Boyai Plying Corps is subject to military law, and the view of the Army Council is that it would he inadvisable to&apos;disturb in the middle of the war e system whose working-is familiar to all.2. If the new Air Force, whilst serving for ins toneein France, is subjected to military law no extra burden is imposed on any single pereon.      So far ss the -army is concerned, its relation to the Air Force in matters of discipline will remain precisely what at present is the relation of other arms to the Koyal Flying Corps.     So far as the Air Force is concerned, it will in any case have to familiarise itself with Air Force j-aw:    it is siresdy familiar with military law. On the other hand, if tho Air Force is subject to Air Force law only, every military authority ought to familiarise himself with Air Force Law.      It is no sufficient answer to this to say that Air Force Law closely resembles Military Law.     The point is that a military officer convening or confirming an Air Force Court Martial under Section 122 (6), a military officer lent to sit on an Air Force Court Ilartial under Section 48 (-10), any officer or non-commissioned officer giving an ordor to an airman under Section 184.A., and any military policeman called in to arrest an airman, ought to    to know in what respects Air Force Law differs from military law.3. It has been objected thet the ..ir Force Bill createscertain offences which are not known to military lav;, and that if the Air Force wero placed under military law this valuable part of the Bill would be in practice sacrificed.     This, however, need not be so.     At present when air force personnel are subject to the Havel Discipline Act, Section 179 (c) of the Air Force Act provides that they may be tried end punished zander that Act for an offence for which they are not amenable to a naval court martial, but for which they can be punished under tho Air Force Act.     A similar proviso could and certain-ly should bo inserted in the proposed section subjecting the Force to military law.4. It has further been objected that it would be undesir-able for Air Force personnel to be tried normally by military officers.      This is recognised; but it is not considered that this would bo the effect of placing the Air Force under military Law,     *.ir Force personnel would normally be tried by Air Force officers,  just as the personnel of the Aoyal Naval Division is at present normally tried by officers of the hoyal Naval Division, or Australian     soldiers by Austra-lian officers.     In fact, however, st present it is not usual for members of the Royal Plying Corps to be tried &quot;by Royal Flying Corps officers, on account of the exacting nature of these officers&apos; other duties:    and power has even been oxpress-ly teken in Section 48 (10) of the Air Force Bill to perpetuate this system.     From the military point of view, there is no desire or intention to impose military officers on airmen^ court martial.
5.       The joint order under Section 184.A.% Army Act end bection 90.A., &quot;.L\ Act, has net teen found sufficient as Ixtmeen the Army and :&quot;avy; end -here tlx so twe forces are conducting continuous joint operations, the powers of the Have! Discipline, (Service erf shore) Act have teen found necessary. &quot;The Army and Air Foroo will ho in cicso and continuous oo-oneraticn every dry of the \pr, and there is no reason to believe that a scheme which wes found inadequate as between the Army and Ilavy, will he adequate as between the Army end Air Foroo.6.        bo far as con ho s- on, the Air Force sacrifices nothing cf its individuality as a service by being subjected at times to military law, provided the proviso suggested in orrc/xaph 3 above is adept eel.   In effect the Ferae would remain completely subject to Air Foreo Law, because Air torso Law is military law plus a now element, end this new element would bo preserved by the proviso.   On the other hand, the advantage of subjecting yhem to military law plus the new element in Air Force Lew, instead cf to Air Force Law as a whele as such   lies in the simplification for all concerned of the edministration of discipline, end in the ryoidanee of doubts and uncertainties in the minds of all who have to administer it.7.       The Air Organisation Committoe in their letter cf the oth November have expressed their intention nthat there shall be that unity of Gomnena ever military and ear forces serving in the same theatre of r:ar, which will obviously bo desirable&quot;, The difference, therefore, is one cf morns, net of end. The Army Council have examined tlx moans proposed by the Committee, and they dc net regard them as adequate. In any ca.se, it must surely be admitted that the&apos;7 are comnlicateo* end even if the Council could awree with the Ccwr.ittee as to theiriadequacy, they would still be cf opinion that it is inadvisable in the present emergency to disturb the existing system, which works&quot; well and whose working is known to ell who have to administer it, and substitute for it a system whose exact working it is difficult to foresee in every detail.War Office.15th November, 1917.
