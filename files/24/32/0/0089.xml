Italian demands are of extreme urgency for re-equipment of second Army and replacement of losses in others. I consider them on the whole moderate and I believe they can be met generally without serious detriment to our own programmes. Louchour has been authorised by French Government to contribute an equal quantity and is prepared to do so immediately subject to our taking similar action. Dallolio is waiting here till tomorrow Tuesday night. Question is one of policy not of detail. If you decide in principle to give aid demanded jointly with the French I am sure details can be arranged satisfactorily. I therefore recommend you to authorise me to promise this aid tomorrow in conformity with the French subject (1) to such arrangements of details and methods as may be convenient and (2) to provision for repayment of material next year which Dallolio offers on which however it is not well to count too much.

A further
A further Conference on Munitions, frill, be nece-ssary at end of this month In order to secure unity of production parl passU with unity of command.      The loss of two million tons given to Clementel Is incomparably more serious to us than these new Italian demands.     I hope with Loucheurs aid to secure some abatement in the interests of munitions of tonnage which Clementel has captured. Pray let me have answer tomorrowon Immediate Italian demand.Laytonfs telegram begins -Italian Minister has made the following urgent demands to meet immediate needs for equipment of three hundred thousand men whom he states are without arms.1.       150,000 British pattern Rifles with 75,000,000 rounds Of small arms ammunition (Loucheur is supplying similar quantity of French pattern but cannot do more.2.      2,000 Machine Guns with 20,000,000 rounds of smallarms ammunition (Loucheur also supplying similar amount),3.      300 - 18 pounder guns with 600,000 rounds..4.      300 Medium Guns or Howitzers with 300,000 rounds.5.      40 Heavy Howitzers or Mortars.6.       40 Tanks,On these we suggest following considerations 1.      Could probably be supplied from home stocks or stocks inFrance, plus two weeks new deliveries.   Net effect would fte to postpone final completion of re-armament with service rifles of H-ome and Indian Forces and Volunteers for a few months say from January 1919 to May 1919.     This period could be shortened by maintaining output of Standard Arms Company which was being discontinued.   Smalls arms ammunition would probably have to be drawn from Home Forces. 2.      Could be met by Hotchkiss Guns which are accumulating in advance of Tanks,
Can only be met by sending next months output to Italy which must reduce establishment either in France or Home Forces .Italians want six inch Howitzers .   We are examining possibility of Italy making carriages to balance our surplus guns , but immediate demand can only be met at expense of equipment in France .   If demand is agroed to it is important that return of guns for repair should not be delayed .Italians want, ten inch or over , but would accept eight inch.     Propose sending marks one to five which it was intended to send to Russia later, but which have not been promised ,Would involve training personnel.. All these demandsare in addition to munitions supplied with British Units .
