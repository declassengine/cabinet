The following particulars as to the extent to which the Government have already borrowed from neutral countries were laid before the Committee:-

NORWAY.

In June 1916, we raised a Bankers&apos; loan of 40,000,000 kroner of which 35,000,000 repayable in July and August 1918, is still outstanding. In September 1916, we raised a second loan of 140,000,000 kroner repayable in July 1918, all of which has now been drawn and is still outstanding. In May 1917, we raised a third loan of 51,500,000 kroner of which 41,500,000 kroner is still in hand. The total for Norway is thus 226,500,000 kroner.

DENMARK.

10,000,000 kroner in cash have been advanced by a Bank, and two Banks have each lent 10,000,000 kroner against Treasury Bills. We have lately asked the Foreign Office to attempt to make the advance of a further loan a condition of the grant of further coal.

SWEDEN.

For diplomatic reasons we have been unable to raise any loan in this country in spite of several attempts. A loan was raised by the French in 1916, from the proceeds of which we slightly benefitted.

HOLLAND.

We have paid for produce in Treasury Bills, by special arrangement, to the amount of £10,735,000. We have quite recently financed sugar purchases from Java by issuing Exchequer Bon? to the value of £1,950,000.

SPAIN.

Hitherto legislation has prevented the issue of Foreign securities in Spain. We are, however, endeavouring to make it a condition of a new commercial agreement with Spain, that this difficulty should be removed, and that the Spanish Government will do nothing to hinder a
loan on satisfactory terms to the BritislrGoT^^ .s/.ijr.ce.a*V/e arc negotiating for a loan up to 12,500 000 francs a month for ten months,   &quot;v/e are also exploring oho possibility of meeting liabilities under a munitions contract in Switzer-lend by the issue of securities,It was nointod out that the most urg.nt case was that of Holland, owing to the fact that the drrin of Gold to that country, for the purpose mainly of mooting contracts for food entered into by tne Blockade Minister end for thetRussian coupons, had recently been increasing at an alarming rate. i Particulars were given by the Treasury which showed that since the 14th Juno of the present yoar  7,250,000 in gold had been already shipped to Holland, and the shipment of a further  2,000,000 was now being arranged.Statistics were furnished by the Blockade Department showing the extent to which imports of foodstuffs&apos;into Germany had decreased owing to the operation of tho Agreement, andit was urged that thequestion which the C omit too had to decide was whether tho blockade sraluo of this decrease was worth the cost of the bonus which amounted roughly to  700,000 a year. Representatives of the Treasury pointed out that it was not the cost of tho bonus alone which had to be considered, but tho total cost of goods brought in&apos;under the provisions of the Agreement i.o. a sum of  7,000,000 to  10,000,000 per year,The position was rendered additionally difficult owing to the fact that the Dutch would undoubtedly prefer the Agreement to bo denounced, as in the,t event tno produce would be sold to the Germans at a considerably higher price- On tho other hand the Exchange Committee felt that it was impossible to allow the shipment&apos;&quot;of gold to Holland to continue, and that somo other means must be found to supply the necessary credit for our purchases, and that in future such credits must be rovided&apos;prior to Government Departments committing themselves b obligations involving cash payments. Unless this was done tho Exchange Committee were &quot;convinced&quot; a failure to meet our ori-gagomonts was within mcasurablo distanceTho Committee felt the force of this latter viow, and woro of opinion that the drain on our gold reserve must either be counteracted by exports or loans, or, failing that, the produce must be allowed to go to Germany.   In the course of oho subsequent discussion the view was expressed that greater diplomatic pressure should be brought to bear on the Nether-lands Governments   It v/as also suggested that tho offer of coal to Holland might bo used as a lever to obtain a loan,Tho Committee were impressed with the fact that there was a need for a closer liaison between the Foreign Office and the Treasury on this aspect of tho question.The Committee accordingly decided to recommend :-That an official should be appointed who should be solely responsible, (with&quot;the assistance of a representative of the&apos;Treasury and tho Foreign Office) for advising the Government a.s to tho possibility of raising credits in neutral countries.The discussion on the general Cjuostion was adjournedc(Initialled)c M.2,\fiiitoho,ll Gardens.
