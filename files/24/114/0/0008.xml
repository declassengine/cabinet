The Committee do n*t recommend that November11th be proclaimed a Public Holiday as this would cause a great dislocation of business and holidays are occa-sions for public rejoicing and not suitable for tho Ceremonies contemplated on Armistice Day,2. The Unveiling and Burial Ceremonies shouldbe regarded as &quot;Domestic&quot; functions in which only peoples^ of the British Empire should participate.   Proposals have been received from the French Government asking *. if they might pay military honours to the Unknown Dead at the port of embarkation and also send a Guard ts accompany the Body on the&apos;Destroyer; and further, if a small mixed body of French soldiers and sailers might participate in the Ceremonies in London. The Committee reooramend that the first suggestion be
gratefully accepted, and that the other two proposals he refected.3.

-   11(1(30)       The Burial Service will be abbreviated and conducted as follows k short Psalm,A few verses from the Book of Revalatione,A short Anthem.The Committal.One cr two Prayers.A Hymn, andThe Blessing,Massed buglers and drums will then Bound the &quot;ReveilleeM, after which there will be a muffled peal of bells,In the Abbey awaiting the arrival of the Procession will be a band of the Grenadier Guards.(3l)      As regards the allocation of accommodation in theAbbey, the Committee, acting on the instructions of theCabinet, decided to allot the seats as follows in the South Transept 300 relatives.In the North Transept 100 representatives of the principle organisations of Ex-Service Ken, 100 men who have been wounded and blinded in the War and 20 nurses who served in the War.In the Nave there will be, waiting the arrival of the Procession, 410 relatives, and 100 repr-esenta-tiveo of the three -Fighting Services, who will be selected from those who won the Victoria Cross or greatly di eh in crushed themselves by their &apos; valomv in&apos; the recent ?.&apos;ar,The stamen will be placed on either side of the aisle facing inwards, and the Procession will pass to the grave down the lane thus formed.The Committee note that Members of-both Houses of Parliament have voluntarily waived any claim they might possess to special accommodation near theCenotaph.- Having regard to the view of His Majesty&apos;s Government that, while no provision should be made for Members of Parliament as a &quot;class&quot;, but that some accommodation might be granted in the Abbey for those Members who have lost sons or near relatives in the War,
the Gorjri.it tec have accepter!   the of Per of the Dean and Chapter of Westminster to set aside 200 seats in the Choir of the Abbey for bereaved llcnbern of both Houses,Members of Parliament will not have special accommodat ion near. the Conotaph.(32) &apos;    After the conclusion, of the Burial Ceremony, the King and. Chief Mourners and distinguished&apos; personages will pass out of the Abbey by the Greet *7est Door,The grave will then at once be filled in with loose French earth.Arrangements will be made by the &quot;Dean in conjunctio with the Office of &quot;forks for the grave to be protected from the pressure of spectators after the Burial Ceremony, by rails connected by a Barrier,The Tar Office will arrange for the mounting of a Guard ever the Grave for such time an nay be necessary.(33)       After the principle mourners have left the Abbey, relatives of the Fallen and other members of the public, will be admitted, under proper military and police surveillance, to the Nave by the North Door.(34)       All windows, balconies, doorways and areas in Government Offiocs on either side of Whitehall between Downing Street and Great George Street have been reserved for the discosal of the Committee on November the 11th.(35)      Apart fron the 710 re1ativee wh0 have been&apos;grantedaccommodation in the Abbey the following further provision has been mads for the bereaved near the Cenotaph and Abbey:- ,Standing room, for 200 relatives on the Abbey Lawn near Bt, Margaret&apos;s Church-.Standing room for 2,000 relatives &apos;3ast of the Cenotaph;    an-; 1,000 relatives West of the C e n c t a ph, one h e p a v em e r.t s.
A cconmo dat i on for 1, c;00 female rel at ive s in Government windows overlooking the Cenotaph and the route from the Cenotaph to the Abbey.Further accommodation for the relatives will boavailable, as other Government Departments whose Officesare not situated between Downing Street and Groat george street have offered to place their windows at the Committee&apos;disposal for the relatives.(36)       The Committee decided that the fairest way in which to allot tickets will be by ballot among the following categories(a) &quot;romen who have lost Husband and son or only son,(b) Mothers who have lost all or only&apos;sons. &apos;(c)   &apos;&quot;&apos;idows.The ballot was conducted on the l?th November, 1920 at. the Office of &quot;hrka.Tickets of various .colours, in order to distinguish the different localities where accommodation is granted, are now being issued to those who were successful in the ballot,(37)      The. Committee originally recommended that female relatives only should be granted accommodation,     For various reasons, they decided that it was desirable that, in a case where the recipient of the ticket was herself not able to come to London, she should be permitted to hand the ticket to some close relative, e,s, to her husband, or her brother.through the m&quot;diur of idv Press An appeal will be made/to the good feeling of the recipients of tickets not to abuse the privilege bydisposing of the tickets to those who are in no wayentitled to be present.
(38)       Sir Arthur Stanley has been requested to see if arrangements can be made by him with firms willing to lend lorries and omnibuses or private vehicles to enable a certain number of wounded to view the Procession from Constitution Hill,    -(39)       In the event of a dense fog prevailing on the morning of the 11th November, it will probably be necessary to abandon the unveiling ceremony and the Procession from Victoria Station on that day.     In this case, the Body will be taken direot from the Station along Victoria Street to the Abbey where a Burial Service on the lines indicated, above will take place.(40)      The Cormr.ittee do not recommend that the Government should make any arrangements for the accommodation of the bereaved who may receive tickets.     These latter will have to travel to and from London at their own expense and to make their own arrangements as to accommodation.(50)       i\To wreaths    at all will be placed on the Cenotaph until after the Unveiling Ceremony is aver.     The Committee rejected the suggestion that the Government might offer to collectwreaths   from relatives in the Provinces and place them on the Cenotaph..- 11 -lhit ohal 1 Card:. na , S. 7.1.5th Ifov- mbsr, 1920.
