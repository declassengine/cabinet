Secretary of State for Colonies to Governor General of Australia. 1st November, 1920.

Following from Mr. Lloyd-George for your Prime Minister. Begins. Secret. The arrival of your telegram of 8th October was opportune. For some time I have been anxious that we should renew that personal consultation between Prime Ministers which produced such good results in last two years of war and at Paris. I fully realise that in the absence
absence uf such consultation and of some machinery for giving it more continuity British Government must inevit-ably tend to take upon itself responsibility for settling many urgent questions of foreign policy arising from day to day which require immediate decision yet which often involve consequences vitally affecting whole Empire,   I feel this to bo fair neither to British Government nor to Dominions.     I know also that there are many other matters of common interest which call for consultation and decision.,Acting upon your suggestion I telegraphed to the other Prime Ministers proposing that a Meeting of the Imperial Cabinet should be hold not later than June 1921 on lines of Imperial War Cabinet Meetings 1917-18,-, At such a meeting wo could clear the decks as far as possible of the more urgent problems which will have accumulated and we could try to devise practical working method for arriving; at common Imperial policy in foreign affairs. composition agenda and meetingplace of Constitutional Conference which in 1917 it was contemplated should be held immediately after war could also be discussed.   Personally I incline to think that this Conference could hardly be held with advantage until public opinion in the Empire has had time to give somewhat more attention to whole problem,.   Prime Minister of Canada is I find of same opiiiion*   Ho tell me that in Canada it is considered that Constitutional Conference could not be held during 1921 with pood results0I have now received replies from other Prime Ministers.
