Committee of Homu Affairs;THIS DOCUKENT IS TH5 PROPERTY OP HIS BRITArMC hAJSSTY!S government^KNMEM1,11th August; (H.A.C73), when it was agreed that the Bm should be introduced and passed during the present Session, but thatit should be brought once more before the Committee for detailed consideration after the Recess.2,3   &quot;With regard to the points (2) and (3) in the minute of the Committee dealing with this Bill, I am nor in a position to say that the Ministry of Health have consulted further with the Treasury and that the outstanding points in regard to the financial measures referred to in Clause 5 of the Bill have been settled. -At the suggestion of the Treasury provision has been made in the Bill authorising the Public Works Loan Commission-ers to advance money to voluntary associations for the provi-sion of dwelling-houses in village settlements.The Scottish Office have also been consulted and a clause has been inserted in the Bill providing f02? the application of certain parts of the Bill to Scotland.A revised draft of the Bill is appended to this memorandum.-3.   As regards point (4) in the Minute of the Committee (H.A.C.73), I should like to point out that, although Sanatorium Benefit is to be discontinued, Insurance Committees will still have important duties to discharge, more particularly in regard to the provision of Medical Benefit for insured persons.-   It is therefore impracticable at the present&apos;time to abolish the machinery of Insurance Committees.C ADDISGN.Ministry of Health.-25th October, 1920.
