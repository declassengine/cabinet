P. 2043.

CONTROL OF IRISH BUTTER.

Note by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.

(Reference C.P. 20?).

I trust that the proposal of the Food Ministry will not be approved.

Food Control was not established and should not be used to deprive England of supplies.

Yet this is what the Irish Department of Agriculture have persuaded the Minister of Food to propose.

It is sought to justify the proposal on two grounds:

(i) that Irish butter producers are breaking their agreement; and

(ii) that they will profiteer "by selling at a higher retail price than was implied in the agreement."

Neither of these reasons justifies the imposition of a blockade of England. The Cabinet refused a similar request in the case of pigs and I hope that it will decline to sanction this proposal.
