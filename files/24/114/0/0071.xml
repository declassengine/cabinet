EGRET.Referred to k^w^Committee of Home affairs this DOCUMENT IS TIE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC iMJ^STY1 SO.P.^ 2070 DEKEISTS BILL,&apos;%H7f ALLS^iMOMl^DUl! BY THE MINISTER OP HEALTH, M.H.3,0..,T*7With reference to the decision of the Home Affairs Committee 73(2), I have to ask for the reconsideration of the decision not to introduce the Dentists Bill during the present Session.      A considerable section of the House made representations to Mr. bonar law and myself that this Bill, which is not controversial, should be introduced at once, fir. Bonar Law authorised me to tell the deputation that the Bill would be introduced on the understanding that the Government was under no obligation to proceed further with it this Session but that it would afford an opportunity for ascertaining whether it might be possible to obtain an agreed measure.   The principal object of the Bill which has already been circulated to the Home Affairs Committee, is to prohibit the practice of dentistry by unqualified persons,, the Interests of existing unregistered practitioners being safeguarded by provisions which would admit them to the Register on the most liberal terms consistent with due regard to the protection of public health.     The qualified dentists are extremely anxious for the prohibition of unqualified practice.   The unqualified practitioners are equally anxious for admission to the Register, not only for the sake of the professional status it would give ttbut also because under the Dangerous Drugs Act the use of cocaine by unqualified men is very severely restricted.   Since both sections of dentists want the Pill, neither-side can afford to endanger its passageby/
by pressing amendments on any vital point.   I therefore asl: the sanction of the Committee to the immediate introduction of the Bill on the understanding that it is to be treated as an agreed Bill which will not be proceeded, with if this understanding is not observed.C ADD IS ON.5=11,1920.inistryof Health.
