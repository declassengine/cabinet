This resolution indicated the con-ditions judged indispensable &quot;fey the Oounoil for the very existence of an Independent .-jrmenian state, and proposed to the Allied Powers, if their efforts to find a state willing to accept a Mandate for Armenia wore not successful, to examine with them euitablo measures for safeguarding the future of tho Armenian people.    The Council would be glad to have the frontiers of Armenia definitely fixed, in order to make it possible for this examination to lead to useful results.    The approach of the date fixed for the Assembly of the League, to whioh the problem may be submitted by fche interested parties, when the request for admission to the Loaguo is presented by Armenia, makes us think it still moro desirable that this examination should take place without delay,     Tho Council feels confident that in this f   matter the views of your Government will be in agreement with those of the Council.I have tho honour to bo. Sir,Your obedient Servant, (Sd.) HYMANS.President of tho Council of the League of Nations,.
