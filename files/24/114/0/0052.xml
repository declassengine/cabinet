QtrnJilLLP.,0.00^^ ,s the Property of/ v.295His Brit?/&apos;Vo??i Viceroy, Foreign and FolUwal DepaHfflbnt,50201st November 1920. (Received 2.30 p..m.)^SHALL G^lr the line.1266 S.   Your telegram of 29th October.   Afghanistan.   The lines.yon lay down for letter to Amir are those contemplated by ourselves.   We had realised that Bolsheviks at Ghazni and Kandahar would render the conclusion gf friendship treaty impossible.   We do not, however, feel in position to confront Amir (? with) specific clauses of the latest form of draft agreement as we are not certain of them. Bolshevik &apos; communications from Kabul, since return thither of Tarsi, lead us,to believe original terms; propounded before Mussoorie Conference have been much modified., &quot;But Suritz has ceased to give full details by wireless, and has only given outline of principal modifications.   We believe, however, that guiding principles of agreement are set.&apos;, forth in telegram from Suritz of 19th August, repeated to Director of Military Intelligence in Chief of the General Staffs telegram X. 1662, dated 9th September,&apos; vide especially statement by Tarsi that Afghanistan desire to&apos; be absolutely neutral with regard to both sides, and not to be turned into arena for propaganda of either side. We read Suritz&apos;s telegram of 8th September, repeated in Chief of the General Staffs telegram to Director of Military Intelligence, No. X. 1727,&apos; of 4th October, as conceding these principles generally and as indicating that (?it is most important) to give subsidy and render other assistance to Afghanistan ostensibly for purpose of securing friendship of Afghanistan and cessation of (anti) Russian intrigues by Afghans in (? Central Asia) the anti-British designs being carefully covered up.   Further, as&apos;, agreement was finally drafted before news of overthrow of Bokhara, and considerable friction&apos;has evidently developed since between Afghans and Bolsheviks, it seems probable, even if Moscow ratifies agreement, Amir has now no intention of doing so before further negotiations with us.   In these circumstances I am addressing&quot; the Amir as follows: (I.F.O. C.C. 1906.)   &quot;I was very glad to hear from you that like myself, you desire an early conclusion of the negotiations for a treaty of friendship between our two Governments.   Your letter fortified me in hoping that the three months&apos;conference at Mussoorie would pave the way to the conclusion of such a treaty on principles&apos;(? laid down) in the aide-memoire presented by my representatives. . Hence, though under, the Peace Treaty of Rawalpindi, it was provided that an Afghan delegation should visit India for the final conclusion of a treaty, nevertheless, in deference to (? your) expressed wishes in the matter, His Majesty&apos;s Government were prepared to waive this stipulation, and to send an envoy to Kabul to negotiate a&apos; treaty of friendship. Since, however, the presentation of the aide-memoire our wireless installation at&apos;, Peshawar has received (? a) wireless message in clear language, addressed liy Hop tier, head of Bolshevik Department of (? foreign relations) in Tashkend to Suritz, the Bolshevik [representative at Kabul, congratulating Suritz on the establishment of final. &apos; and mighty relations between Soviet Republic of. Russia and the Independent Amir of Afghanistan, and we have reason to believe that amongst other clauses the Bolsheviks have stipulated, for instance, for. the location of- their consulates at Ghazni and, \ Kandahar in return for a subsidy.   My friend, I find it difficult to believe that these Bolsheviks&apos; claims can be founded upon fact, for you will readily realise that should any such agreement have-been concluded in fact, it would render conclusion of friendship treaty between Great Britain and Afghanistan (? impossible).   My representative at  -(? Mussoorie) was indeed at pains to point out that if any agreement designed by the Bolsheviks directly or indirectly against Great Brjtain were made between Afghanistan&apos; and Bolsheviks, this would be looked on by (? British Government) as an unfriendly  . act, and in these circumstances no useful purpose would be served by despatch of a mission to-Kabul.   I am thus placed in a position of great difficulty and -uncertainty, and must ask (? my omitted) friend to deal with me, with same candour with which I am dealing with him, and to tell me whether any such agreement has been or is being-made with the Bolsheviks, and if so, its precise terms.   It would be for. me a matter of great personal disappointment were I to leave India without the conclusion of friendship treaty with &quot;Afghanistan.   As we deal,with &quot;each other with frankness there is one matter which I wish to mention now, so as to -avoidv any possibility of further misunderstandings.   As you know, the WayirsVof Wano have for:a long h time past committed serious depredations on the neighbouring districts.   I had hoped submission of Mahsuds would have brought them to their senses.   But their behaviour has recently become intolerable, and I have now caused terms to be (? announced) to them which they had (sic) been required to accept by the 15th November.   If they accept these terms, which are far more lenient than they have a right to expect,  it  will be well.   If, however, they do  not  accept by the 15th November, I am unalterably  determined to .send . an . expedition for their chastisement.&quot;
