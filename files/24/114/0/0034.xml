\NAVAL STRATEGY AS AFFECTED BY T.HS PROPOSED FUTURE STATUS OF EGYPT.Memorandum by the Chief of the Naval Staff,In view of the far-reaching proposals with regard, to the future Government of Egypt whioh are now before the Cabinet, it is desirable that the naval aspect of this question should be clearly stated, as the decision whioh will be taken is one of vital importance to our Naval Strategy.2.    The oontrol of the sea communications of the Empire is the duty of the Navy, and one of the main arteries of these communications, oonneoting the United Kingdom with India, Australia, and our other territories in the Far East, passes through the heart of Egypt *    The diversion of traffio to the -Cape route in the event of the Canal not being available would be a very grave disadvantage.3.    The safety of the Suez Canal route to the East is a matter of more urgent importance at the present time than ever before, for the reason that we are called upon to faoe a naval situation which has never previously arisen.4.    Up to the time of the late War, the principal foreign naval power was concentrated in Europe, and necessitated a similar concentration of our naval forces.     At the present time our only two serious rivals on the sea - Japan and the U.S.A. -are to be found in widely separated quarters of the globe, and it is&apos; impracticable to keep the fleet at a sufficient strength to effect  the double concentration at home and in the East whioh would enable us to meet the situation satisfactorily/-.5.    The fleet must, therefore, make up for its lack of preponderance in all ooeans by its mobility, that is to say, its capacity for effecting a cjuiok passage to any threatened portion of the Empire.   &apos;6.     In thi3 Question of mobility the Suez Canal plays a vital part.    The alternative route to the East, via the Cape, is far longer, and time maybe of the utmost importance:    the security or los&amp; of an.outpost of Empire like Hong &quot;Kong may be decided by the availability of the Canal route.7.    ^The Suez Canal and its approaches are the most delicate link in the chain of naval communications with the East, since the narrow and shallow nature of these waterways renders then more easily open to Interruption by attack from, land or sea than any other portion of the route.8.     It is essential to our naval strategy that the safety of the Canal route is assured to us.(Sd.)      BEATTY.27. 10. 20.
