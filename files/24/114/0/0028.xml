Students after some opposition presented ultimatum to Principal and Trustees demanding resignation of titles and renunciation of Government grants. Sliaukat Ali promised support of one crore rupees from private sources. Reply demanded by 29th October. Principal has called meeting of Trustees for 27th October, and has addressed parents summoning them to Aligarh to control students. Syndicate lias been holding daily sittings and announced determination to uphold principles on which Syed Ahmed based institution. Syndicate notified no one should address College students inside College without previous written permission of Principal, but two outside Maul vis preached to students yesterday without permission. United Provinces Government been asked for full appreciation of situation. Meantime we have private information that students beginning to regret action taken and parental influence beginning to make itself felt. Latest report states that about 70 parents arrived and taken boys home to await decision of Trustees. 200 parents written disapproving of action of Gandhi, Ali brothers and students, and asking that their sons be sent home. Bhopal State temporarily withdrawn all Bhopal students. Telegrams and letters received from old boys and friends from many quarters expressing strong disapproval of incident. Parents passed resolution urging Trustees to take immediate effective steps to exclude outsiders from visiting College, and Honorary Secretary and Principal urge parents to take immediate charge of boys to avoid unforeseen, consequences.2. At Lucknow on 15th Gandhi made speech in Hindustani before audience of some 40,000 to 50,000. Advised organisation of Hindustan into large lashkar practising discipline. Islam at stake. Indians slaves under present Government. But armed resistance impossible because Hindus, though possession of swords not forbidden rendered cowards by Government snatching away arms. Non-co-operation only means of ending slavery. Government devilish ; co-operation with it sinful. Condemned Willoughby murder and said &quot; When we shall use swords we shall warn Europeans, women and children.&quot; Denounced recruiting for Army, compared Government to dacoit, and promised Swaraj within year if his policy followed. Local Government report masses unaffected and meeting conspicuous for absence of many leading men. Agitators reported to be worried at reception of Gandhi in United Provinces. Lieutenant-Governor will telegraph further on advisability of prosecution later.   Our appreciation of speech and its effects telegraphed separately.o. Following reports from provinces. Madras. Non-co-operation reported not making much, headway. No further resignations of titles received. Meetings held in Madras to further programme not attracting large audiences, and local leader in intercepted letter to Shaukat Ali asks him to send Mahomed Ali help cause. Committee&apos;s activities in direction of threatening opponents with social ostracism.4. Bombay. We have received following information regarding proceedings of All-India Congress Committee of 2nd October, and Home Rule League Meeting of 3rd October. Former attended by 35 only out of 121 members of whom 28 from Bombay and Madras.   Latter attended by 61. members only out of All-India totalAlthough All-India Congress Committee accepted Gandhi&apos;s interpretation and .scope of Congress resolution passed in Calcutta, statement issued to Press merely contained instructions based on GandhiY report and popular belief that matter magnificent triumph for him. Meeting of All-India Home Rule League was a stormy one, main item of discussion was present constitution which is clearly permissive of unconstitutional and illegal action against creed of Congress to which League is an affiliated body. Further clause mentions &apos;.&apos; (? unlimited) complete&quot; Swarajya in accordance with wishes of people, but restricted to definition in Article 1 of Congress constitution. Strong suspicion has manifested itself that mental reservation was behind, this clause, permitting complete independence if necessary. Gandhi had 2604     100  10.20of 6,000.
majority of 42 to 19, and declared proposition carried in spite of strong protest that constitution required three-quarters majority. Jinnali and .19 influential members have resigned, and more are expected to follow. General belief was that Jinnah and party were (? justly) (? over) suspicious, and that feeling against Gandhi will probably be increased through confirmation of the suspicion of the opposition by the resolution passed by the Moradabad Provincial Congress which Gandhi attended, recommending modification of Article 1 of Congress Constitution, that goal of India is attainment of Swaraj in accordance with wishes of people. All-Indian constituencies have nominated candidates, although many, especially in Gujarat, wobbled till last moment; left to be seen how they will meet the final onslaught of Gandhi; and of Nationalists who are-organising final extensive campaign in Gujarat and Deccan. It is not expected, that votes recorded will be large owing to ignorance and apathy. Gandhi pushing, boycott of schools zealously in Gujarat, and met with certain degrees of success at Gujarat and Ahmadabad, but especially at Nadiad where local municipality been, induced to refuse grant from Government and private high school forced to refuse grant-in-aid.5. Bengal. Non-co-operative movement not made any appreciable progress-Gandhis attempt to hedge on question of boycott of foreign goods calculated to appeal to Marwari supporters in Calcutta, but not further cause among extremist leaders-Signs of split among latter. Malaviya&apos;s lead referred to in last week&apos;s telegram, attracted a good deal of attention and some followers, foremost among whom was&quot;-I. B. Sen.This section of extremists drawn up schemes for improving sanitation and industry in villages, but details and exact nature of policy and extent of breach with non-co--operation not yet clear. Few fresh instances of practical non-co-operation such as one or two resignations from provincial councils, districts boards, &amp;c. On the other hand Nawab of Dacca issued declaration condemning non-co-operation and withdrawing support of movement. Provincial Khilafat committee organising propaganda amongst the masses. Office opened, over 100 volunteers offered including many released detenus,, and Abul Kalam Ayad to supervise at a salary of Rs. 800 a -month. More serious development is formation of body of 100 volunteers professing themselves ready to-sacrifice lives in cause of community. Scheme avowedly borrowed from Kgypt and Ireland with object of committing overt acts, such as cutting telegraph wires, and upsetting railway trains. Canvassing by J. N. Roy led to formation of Raiyats. Associaion likely to develop on economic side with view of resisting illegal demands, by landlords.6. United Provinces.

Agitation acute and showrs no sign of abatement. Khilafat lecturer convicted in Hardoi under sections 124 (a) and 153 (a) and sentenced to three years&apos; imprisonment; second agitator being prosecuted in same district. Prosecutions reported to have good effect and likely to check spread of agitation in small towns and villages.In spite of withdrawals of candidates from Council election, signs of rivalry in many districts, though between persons rather than policies.7. Delhi.-National Court referred to last week now sitting but regarded as jest. Cognisable cases not dealt with. Asaf Ali, briefless barrister, anxious to be appointed Chief Judge on Rs. 2,000, but fees will not run to this. Cause list shows five or six cases, subject matter of all being divorce or recovery of lost women. Defendant in civil case appealed to National Court. Notice issued to decree holder, who laughed and tore it up.More serious is National Volunteer movement, recruiting for which is brisk.Parades held of daily increasing numbers. We are telegraphing separately on our general policy in regard to volunteer movement.One hundred cloth dealers of city, alarmed and annoyed by fall in exchange, resolved not to take up any British orders except at rate of not less than 2s. to rupee. This movement causing much dislocation and distress for European importing firms.8. Punjab non-co-operation meeting little success in practice, due rather to reluctance on the part of people to make personal sacrifice, than to want of hostility to Government, which is increasing and being more openly expressed.
Meetings held in Jullundnr to prevent Europeans from being entertained at Dussehra Horse Fair. Trial in Lahore of Zafar Ali Khan caused considerable excitement, and witnesses freely abused, but on the whole prosecution had sobering effect.Panipat Man. (? his) charged under section 124a and 153a Indian Penal Code, convicted and sentenced to five years&apos; rigorous imprisonment. One of accused threatened magistrate to look to his own safety. Active participation of dissatisfied section of Sikh community in extremist political agitation is now a serious feature of situation ; wearing of large kirpans becoming general. At Sikh league yesterday at Lahore non-co-operation resolution carried as only means to attain Swaraj; Gandhi present, and also held long conference with students of Lahore College. Local members of General Council of Anjumani Himayati Islam accepted non-co-operation, and resolved to move the Anjuman Council to refuse Government grant, and disafliliate Islamia College. Tribune, Lahore newspaper, condemns boycott of schools and colleges; referring to failure of similar movement in connection with partition of Bengal.Malaviya, addressing mass meeting at Lahore last week, advocated complete Swaraj as only remedy, and disagreed with non-co-operation programme only on two points boycott of councils and withdrawal of children from schools. In keeping, however, with his temperamental absence of backbone, he has announced intention of not seeking election to councils on ground that he intends to devote full time and energy towards attainment of Swaraj, endeavouring to formulate programme in full accord with wishes of people.9. Assam. Leading Hindus and Mohamedans in Sylhet now express regret that conferences reported last week should have been held, and especially deplore fact that B. C. Pal allowed to speak. Title holders agreed to be guided by Government pleader as to whether titles should be renounced ; he has taken strong stand against non-co-operation. In Assam Valley ncn-co-operation adopted at various meetings from which older leaders absent, and little enthusiasm aroused. No lack of candidates for Councils, only one constituency not haying nominated one. Tea gardens in Dumdum resumed normal aspect, though district still garrisoned by Assam Rifles,10. Central Provinces.-Stormy meeting of Provincial Congress Committee held 3rd October, Nagpur, when formation of non-co-operation Board to introduce complete scheme of non-co-operation in province discussed. Threats of resignation were (? made) if anything beyond boycott of Councils approved. At subsequent meeting on 11th resolved non-co-operation board be divided into two sub-committees, one to arrange immediate boycott of councils and other to deal with remaining stages of non-co-operation after Nagpur Congress. Number of meetings at various places in province held in support of non-co-operation. Some inflammatory anti-British speeches and considerable outbursts of violent talk.

Serious trouble reported
in Press messages in Buckingham Mills, Perambur, Madras. European weaving master assaulted and pulled out revolver in self-defence ; this snatched from him by workers, but weaving master escaped.
