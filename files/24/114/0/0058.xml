(THIS DOOPMBWT IS        PROEBBTY OF HIS BRITABHIC MUESTY&apos;S GOVEKMu^lT. )S^, Q R jS T. CP.- 058.Copy No.d A B 1 8 ST.BYACUATIOH 0? TEMPORARY.. .Q0VBK1 M3HT OFFICE&apos;BUftDIKSS.fcemoranfium by the First Commissioner of Works.There is a growing agitation, both in Parliament and in loh.-7I    the Press, endeavouring t^ bring pressure to bear upoo myDepartment to remove the temp nary office buildings in the Royal Parks, Eiabankment Gardens, Bto.   A list of suoh buildings, together with the sites, the numbers of staff employed, and the Departments occupying the premises, is contained in the first lioh.1.     Schedule herewith.This question is bound up with the whole problem of accommodation for the enormously increased Government staffs ofto-day, as compared with the pre-war period.   In the secondioh.II     schedule, attached herewith, will be found a statement showing ILA. &apos;the relative position for the post-war period as&apos; compared withthe ore-war periodwhi on the general line of policy/has been pursued since the Armistioe is to evacuate requisitioned hotels, clubs, public galleries, private houses and business premises.   I attach a fcluIII. further statement showing what results have been achieved in thisfli.IVIt.direction, together with a list of the business premises and private houses still occupied with the number cf staffs, etc. Every endeavour is being made to reduce the number of staffs in these Departments and thus release the premises.   More can be dene in this direction if it were made clear, with the authority of the Cabinet, to Departments that accommodation must be considerably reduced.   Bver since I have dealt with the question of Government accommodation I have used every endeavour to impress on my staff the necessity of tho most economical use of accommodation by Government Departments.   To anyone accustomed to the manner in which business firms utilise their premises,
it always appears that the standard of spaoo required by Government Departments is excessive.   I fool, however, that with the issue of strong directions by the Cabinet to the Departments j more economy in space could be achieved.Tho only alternatives .aro for tho Government either to purchase or hire office accommodation or build new offices itself or to continue to use those offices in the Paries which have been put up during the war.   Prom the point of view of economy, it is obvious that the continuation of tho use of offices, convenient and suitable in every respectB in Parks and public space?0 for which no rent is payable, is unquestionably the better policy.   To purchase or hire ordinary office accommodation when the congestion is so great, in competition with business firms, would be very expensive, and while building new offices would be more economical than the second course, it would,,at the same time, be very expensive and open to criticism in view of tho shortage of labour in the Government housing programme-   The objection to the retention of the present temporary offices in the public Parks is mainly of a sentimental and aesthetic character, and it cannot be contended that from the point of view of health., this objection is of any importance.   In itself? it only affects the population of London, and in my view, should be strongly resisted,   as the agitation is likely to bo formidable fl would refer to the resolution   to be moved, by Lord Cainsford in the House of Lords on November the 17th., and to tho various questions put   to mo in the House of Commons) I should be glad to have the support of the Cabinet in maintaining this policy.   It would als o be of great assistance if further considerable reduction of the staffs of Government offices could be ordered.   I would finally add that my policy of evacuation of buildings in thoParks..

This yecemmedation will become available at various dates before December 1924,,13,000 staff still unprovided for permanently.This deficiency will of course be reduced in direct proportion to the further reductions in the numbers of Government staffs and by an insistence on the continuance of tho present policy of a more economical allocation of existing accommodation.     For the remaining balance equivalent accommodation in the temporary buildings in the Royal Parks must be retained unless very drastic reductions of staff are made, or failing that, the Government are prepared to face a very large expenditure in the provision of alternative accommodation to be either hired or erected.ibTACCOMMODATION POLITICK III AUGUST 1914.18,000.
