Extract from Prime Ministerfo letter to PresidentWilson^ 5th. Aupuat 1980:I come now to the other quoation I wish to writo to you about, and that is the knotty problem of Inter-Allied indebtedness,,    Indeed I promiood Mr, Rathbono long ago that I would.write to you about it, but I have had to put it off for one reason and another till now.    The British and Franch Gov ornments have boon discussing during the last four months, the question of giving fixity and definiteness to Germany1s reparation obligations.    The British Government has stood steadily by the view that it was vital that germany&apos;s liabilities should be fixed at a figure whioh it was within the reasonable capacity of Germany to pay, and that this figure should fce/ixod without delay because the reconstruction of Cen-tral Europe could not begin nor could the Allies themselves raise money on the strength of Gonuany&apos;s obligation to pay them reparation until her liabilities had been exactly defined. After great difficulties with his own people, M. Millorand found himself able to accept this view, - but he pointed out that it was impossible for Prance to agree to accept anything loss than it was entitled to under tho Treaty unless its debts to its Allies and Associates in tho war wore treated in the same way*This declaration appeared to the British Government eminently f&amp;Ir*    But after careful consideration they came to the conclusion that it was impossible to remit any part of what was owed them by Franco except as part and parcel of all .round settlement of Inter-Allied indebtedness.     I need   not go into the reasons which led to this conclusion which must bo clear to you.    ;&quot;.iut theprincipal.  t  4   .
principal reason was that British public opinion would never support a one-sided arrangement at its sole expense, and that if such a one-sided arrangement were made it oould not fail to estrange and&apos; eventually embitter tho ralations between the American and tho British people with calamatous results to the future of tho world.    You will remember \hat Great Britain borrowed from the United Bta.tes about ho.lf as much as its total loans to the Allies, and that after America^ entry into the war, it lent to !thc Allies almost oxtaytly the same amount as it borrowed from the***%U.&amp;.A,    Accordingly the British Government has informed the French Government that It will agree to any equitable arrangemont for the reduction or cancellation of Inter-!,iAllied indebtedness, but that such an arrangement must bo one which applies   all round.    As you know, thfe rcprcsenta-tives of the Allies and of Germany are meeting at Geneva in a week or two to commence discussion on the subject of reparation. \i rocognise that in the midst of a presidential election and with Congress not in session it is impossible for the United states to deal with this question in a practical manner, but the question is one of such importance to the future of Europe, and indeed to the relations between the Allied and Associated Powers that I should very, much welcome any advice whioh you might feel yourself able to give me as to the best method of securing that the whole problem could be considered and settled by the Unitod Stato3 Government in concert with its Associates at the earliest possible moment that the political situation in America makes it possible *.......There
There Is one other point which I should like to add, When the British Government decided that it could not deal with the question of -the debts owed to it by its Allies except as part and parcel of an all-round arranp;omont of Inter-Allied debts, tho Chancellor of the 1&apos;xchcquer told &apos;&apos;r. Rathbono that he could not proceed any further with the negotiations which they had been conducting together with regard to the postponcnient of the payment of interest on the funding of Croat Britain^ debts to America,     I should . like to make it plain that this is duo to no reluctance on tho part of Groat &quot;iritain to fund its debt, but solely to the fact that it cannot bind itself by any arrangement which would prejudice the working of any Inter-Allied arrangement which may be reached in the future.    If some method can be found for funding the British debt which does not prejudice the larger question, the British Government would be glad to fall in with it.
