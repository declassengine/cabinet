[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government]Printed for the Cabinet,   November 1920.SECRET AND CONFIDENTIAL.$// RUSSIAN TRADE NEGOTIATIONS.)Memorandum by the Secretary op State for Foreign Affairs.SINCE the Cabinet are now called upon to decide whether to conclude the draft Trade Agreement with the Soviet Government or not, I should like to place clearly before them the various phases of the prolonged controversy, so that we may know exactly where we stand and what also are the standpoint and intentions of the Russians. From secret but indisputable sources of information we know with accuracy the phases through which the case has passed, the controversies in which the Russian delegates have themselves been involved with their Government, and the tactics which both have employed. In these proceedings, of which I have made throughout a careful record and analysis, it has been my duty, as Foreign Minister, to fight throughout for the full and honest fulfilment of the assurances on which alone in my opinion can an agreement with the Soviets either be justified or have a chance of success, conditions which have repeatedly been laid down and as repeatedly accepted, but which (except in respect of the repatriation of prisoners, and there neither fully nor sincerely) no attempt has been made by the Russians to fulfil. For the sake of Russia herself and of employment in England during the winter, everyone of us would be glad to see commercial relations established. But I should be a poor guardian of the interests committed to me if, after this had been done and every trump card that we possess surrendered, I found that, owing to any negligence on my part, British interests or the British Empire were still exposed without mitigation to the ceaseless and deadly assaults on the part of the Bolshevik Government and its agents, which have for months past been directed against them.The political guarantees for which we have throughout contended, as the price of a Trade Agreement, were first defined in our note, sometimes called an ultimatum, of the 30th June, more commonly described by the Russians, from the date on which it was received by them, as the memorandum of the 1st July.In addition to the conditions as to the mutual repatriation of prisoners and the recognition of private debts, His Majesty&apos;s Government demanded that the Russians should refrain from official propaganda, direct or indirect, against British institutions (we accepting a similar obligation) and more particularly from military action or propaganda against British interests or the British Empire. This was described as &quot; the fundamental condition of any trading agreement between Russia and any Western Power.&quot; The Soviets were invited to reply within a week to these conditions, or negotiations would be at an end.On the 7th July Chicherin accepted by telegram the principles laid down in the memorandum of the 1st July.Then ensued the Polish interlude, with the shameless attempt to deceive the British Government made by Kameneff, which resulted in August in the abrupt termination of the latter s mission to Great Britain.Krassin was left in London in the hope that relations might be patched up, and in. order to continue his discussions with British trading firms and with Mr. Wise.The Russians were never quite certain at this juncture on which leg to stand. In their secret instructions they sometimes, while protesting Kameneff s innocence, maintained that the status quo had not been affected. At other times they seized upon a phrase of the Prime Minister, delivered in quite another context, that the Soviet invasion of the ethnographic frontier of Poland was an end of the arrangement between Russia and Great Britain, to proclaim their emancipation from all engage-ments of whatsoever kind. Meanwhile they made no sort of effort to release the. British prisoners, but on the contrary indulged in a campaign of procrastination, -which their subsequent confessions have shown to be deliberate, while they continued[4849]
to pursue a policy of embittered propaganda and indeed of open hostility against British interests and the British Empire in every part of the Middle East.It was in these circumstances that on the 1st October I despatched, with the approval of the Prime Minister and Mr. Bonar Law, the first of my two notes of protest, restating the conditions of the 1st July, pointing out the manner in which they had been persistently violated, and declaring, with a view more especially to secure the release of our prisoners, who were being atrociously treated, that unless we heard by the 10th October that their release was being proceeded with we should take whatever action we might deem necessary.While this was going on an active and even hitter dispute was being waged between Chicherin and Krassin, the former arguing that the agreement of the 1st July was cancelled, the latter contending that unless it was adhered to by the Russians there would be no chance of a Trading Agreement. Chicherin at this time sent &quot; a brusquely-worded note &quot; to Krassin for delivery to us, but it was cancelled on receipt of my note of the 1st October.The Russians now realised that it was of no use to fight or delay further about the prisoners, and on the 4lh October Ohicherm agreed to proceed with a mutual exchange, pleading unsuccessfully for the employment of Litvinof, who at this moment was opportunely turned out of Norway.On the other points Chicherin&apos;s line to Krassin was that the principles of the 1st July ultimatum might be accepted by Krassin when the Trade Agreement had been concluded, but not before; and even so that the political agreement &quot;must not be detailed, but embryonic in nature.&quot;On the 6th October came Krassin s reply to my note of the 1st October arguing that the agreement of the 1st July was no longer operative, because we had broken it by hostile actions in respect of Poland, Danzig, Wrangel, &amp;c ; but that, nevertheless, Russia was anxious to go ahead. She would agree to the exchange of prisoners, and would confirm the assurances given in the note of the 1st July, and wanted to know when the trade negotiations would be resumed.Simultaneously Chicherin showed his hand in a secret telegram (October 8) to Krassin : &quot;I believe so implicitly in the policy of drawing in British business circles without any political agreements, that I particularly insisted on the fact that we must return to purely commercial negotiations without any political negotiations.&quot;This is a very significant passage.Observing that the Soviet reply of the Cth October evaded the entire question of political assurances, and spent itself instead in recriminations against ourselves, I sent, with the approval of the Prime Minister and Mr. Bonar Law, mv second note of the 9th October in which I mentioned seriatim the scenes and incidents of hostile action and propaganda as practised everywhere against us in the East (Persia, Mustapha Kemal, Khorasan, Tashkent, Bokhara, Afghanistan, Baku, propaganda and a flood of gold passim) and said: &quot;This is the situation which must come to an end if the trading negotiations are to be concluded,&quot; and (with special reference to propaganda and hostilities) &quot; His Majesty&apos;s Government will hold the Soviet Government faithfully to a redemption of this pledge.&quot; I submitted a detailed plan (since acted upon) for the repatriation of prisoners and I ended with these words : &quot;The Soviet Government concludes by asking the question when the British Government will be prepared to renew the trade negotiations. The answer is, as soon as the British subjects specified above under categories A., B. and C. have crossed the Russian frontier by land or sea, and it is clear that no obstacles are being placed in the way of the release of the remaining British subjects specified under^ category D., and when&apos; the Soviet Government has endorsed the interpretation which has been placed in this note upon the more general assurances contained in the note of the 30th June, and now explicitly renewed by the Soviet authorities.Upon receipt of this note Krassin in a secret telegram to Chicherin, after warning him to indulge in no more &quot; tricks or quibblings &quot; about the exchange of prisoners, advised him as to the proper reply: &quot;We refuse the literal interpretation of the point as to propaganda and hostile activities in view of the absolute uselessness of such procedure. It is impossible to foresee all the concrete cases of infringement of the general principle of the obligation. On conclusion of the agreement each side will put forward each separate case of infringement, and the Government of the other side will bind itself honestly to take measures to put an end to the infringement, to punish the guilty parties, to make good losses, and so on.   Curzons formula regarding the literal
interpretation is clearly calculated to drag out endlessly the commercial agreement in the desire to extort from us at the same time a one-sided undertaking of non-interference in the East. We should not walk into this trap, even though it became necessary to break off negotiations altogether.&quot; 1This also is a very significant message as indicating the procedure with which we may expect to be confronted.Ghicherin (13th October) told Krassin that my points were &quot;subject to discussion,&apos; and, in the form in which they were mentioned, might cause extremely lengthy, disputes.&quot; Accordingly, they were to be made the subject of reciprocal political; negotiations, and were only to come into force on the agreement being accepted.   -Here for the first time emerged the idea of a separate political conference, ending in recognition, for Chicherin added: &quot;If the British Government insists on giving the July points a concrete form, a political delegation will have to be formed once more,) and admitted into London, where it will take part in a political peace conference&quot;At this stage the Soviet attitute, encouraged by the conclusion of an armistice with Poland and of the improving position versus Wrangel, visibly stiffened. Krassin declared to Chicherin (15th October) that he would decline to renew the July agreement independently of the Trade Agreement. At this stage also Mr, Wise, with whom I had had no communication, was kind enough to give an explanation of my meaning to Klishko, who was thereupon heavily sat upon by chicherin, and told that &quot; he talked as if he had fallen from the moon.&quot;In an illuminating telegram to Krassin of the 25th October, Chicherin declared that &quot;it is absolutely inadmissible that we should sign without discussion Curzon&apos;s absurd indictment,&quot; and he went on to declare their innocence of all responsibility for the Baku Congress, the Tashkent proceedings, or the Communist International in general. But he also recognised the tactical mistake of arguing that the July agreement was no longer in force, since the argument would render it impossible for them to contend that we had not kept it!A draft reply to my note of the 9th October was now submitted by Krassin to Chicherin, who stiffened the last paragraph, which on the 9th November reached us in this form. The Russian Government threw the entire responsibility for delay on the British Government, but added that&quot; animated by an unchanging desire to secure the speedy establishment, of stable and friendly relations, the Russian Government again . proposes to the British Government that immediately upon the conclusion of the Trade Agreement, they should commence the necessary negotiations with reference to the above-mentioned points concerning political agreement. The Russian Government does not doubt that these negotiations will lead to the results which are desirable for both sides, and is ready for this purpose to despatch a political delegation to England or to any other place which may be mutually agreed upon.&quot;Here would appear to have occurred a slight lacuna in connection, for on the same day Chicherin, not apparently aware of what his colleague in London had done, or. being seized with sudden impatience, sent to me en clair the offensive message of the 9th November, subsequently described by himself as an ultimatum, in which, after pouring out all manner of abuse upon His Majesty&apos;s Government and recapitulating a long list of. charges, the majority of them quite transparently tactical and insincere, against us, and holding us exclusively responsible for &quot; the monstrous delay in coming to an economic and political agreement,&quot; he ended with this threat, &quot;the Soviet Government considers that matters can no longer be allowed to drag on in the manner in which they have dragged on these last ten months and that, unless the British Government is prepared to enter into negotiations for a complete Trade Agreement, it will regretfully have to admit that its protracted efforts, in spite of all its good will, have failed this time as completely as they did on previous occasions and will draw the necessary conclusions. It therefore asks the British Government to give a straight and prompt answer to the question whether it is prepared to accede to its suggestion for immediate negotiations for the above-mentioned objects. In view of the. grave issues at stake the Soviet Government hopes to receive a satisfactory reply and further expects that the Trade Agreement will immediately be followed or accompanied hy negotiations for peace and restoration of normal relations through properly constituted bodies of fully authorised delegates appointed by each side at its own discretion, and that the British Government will agree that the Conference shoidd meet in London or some neutral city selected by mutual consent.&quot;Krassin appears to have recognised at once that his hand was not being improved by these tactics on the part of his fiery colleague in Moscow, for he called upon Mr. Wise on the 11th November to explain that &quot; the note of the 9th November was [4849] B 2
not in any way to be regarded as an ultimatum,&quot; although &quot; its tone left something to be desired &quot; !The above narrative appears to me conclusively to establish the following propositions: 1. The delays that have occurred have arisen from no procrastination or obstruction on the part of His Majestys Government, but solely^from the refusal of the Soviet Government to make up its mind as to what line it would take about the political assurances. It has wavered upon this point, eventually coming down on the contention that all such assurances, however sincerely intended, can have no effect until after the Trade Agreement has been signed. The only mention of them in the Trade Agreement is to be &quot; of an embryonic nature.&quot;2. Incidentally this contention reveals the supreme importance to the Soviet Government (upon which in my opinion their continued existence depends) of concluding a Trading Agreement with Great Britain at the present time.3. As the argument has progressed, they have seen the opportunity of once more pressing for a political conference, leading up to ultimate recognition by Great Britain and the conclusion of peace. Accordingly in their last note, with the assurance born of WrangeFs collapse, they exchange the attitude of hair-splitting, recrimination, and evasion, which they have hitherto adopted, for one of open and truculent menace. The Trade Agreement is now to stand alone, and the assurances which on the 30th June we declared to be its fundamental condition are now relegated to a back-seat.4. They conclude by disclosing with perfect candour their own modus operandi in the event of their demands being met and the Trading Agreement concluded as the first act. They will then propose to send a political delegation to England including probably some of our old and moat notorious friends, on the ground that Krassin and Klishko are innocent commercial persons, who cannot be trusted to dabble in politics. Then, if the delegation be admitted, will ensue a long and polemical discussion, in which each case will be debated and disputed ad infinitum, evidence being called for which cannot, from the nature of the case, be given, rebutting evidence being adduced, and counter-charges made. Meanwhile the merry game in the Middle East of intrigue, propaganda, bribery on a colossal scale, military assistance to our enemies, political treaties with persons like the Amir, and a stream of agents pouring into India from every side, will go on while we are discussing exactly what the legal interpretation of propaganda is and what are British interests in Anatolia, or Enzeli, or Turkestan, and whether this or that action of ours in Poland, Roumania or the Ukraine is or is not inimical to Soviet interest.5. I may add (though I have not commented upon it at length) that another potent source of delay has been the prevarication of the Soviet Government about the release of prisoners, notably in the case of the Baku contingent. Up till the end they have been deceitful in this&apos; respect, for, while writing this note, I learn that, just as we are releasing our last batch of Russians, there remain unsurrendered 15 British in Moscow, 76 in Petrograd and 20 in Saratof, whose existence has been deliberately concealed from us.The question may be asked, What course, then, would I propose ? I have offerd no opinion on the draft agreement circulated by the Board of Trade, because I conceive that that is a matter for the Treasury and the Board of Trade rather than for the Foreign Office. But the criticisms, which have also been circulated, from the Federation of British Industries, addressed as they have been to the Foreign Office, seem to me deserving of serious attention.The duty of my office is to see, if it be seriously proposed to conclude an agree-ment, that the political assurances upon which we have repeatedly declared its acceptance to depend, are made effective, that we do not allow ourselves to be duped, and that whatever we gain by the transaction commercially (and it will in my opinion be very small for I am unaware of anything but gold and diamonds which Russia is in a position to export) we do not lose politically.I should decline, therefore, to conclude the trading agreement until we are satisfied that the political activities of the Bolsheviks against us are not merely going to cease at some indefinite moment in a distant future, but have ceased here and now.We are surely entitled to say to them that the meaning of our note of the 30th June was that we should not be able to trade with people whose policy it was to undermine our authority in every part of the world, and that we would not trade with them until they gave up doing so: or, in other words, they must cease before we can trade with them. We have, in fact, said so in both my notes of the 1st and 9th October, but we ought now to press it to its logical conclusion.   It would be absurd to
contend that while Krassin was sitting here and entering under our protection into lucrative arrangements with Armstrong, Marconi, and all the firms mentioned in his telegrams, his friends in Russia were deliberately given carte blanche to carry on a campaign against our interests until the actual moment when the trade agreement should be signed.The fact that since the Russians &quot; accepted &quot; our &quot; conditions &quot; they have continued and even increased their hostile activities not only aggravates the situation, but creates an atmosphere in which relations, even trade relations, become impossible. Moreover, it diminishes the value of the guarantee that, if the trade agreement is concluded, the hostile activities will be brought to an end, since it argues a mentality on the other side which fails altogether to appreciate the need for correct international behaviour. It is true that the draft agreement provides for its own suspension if the Bolshevik side of the bargain is not observed; but the virtual impossibility of switching its operations off and on according to the fluctuations of Bolshevik good faith does not seem to have occurred to its authors. The root difficulty of the whole matter is that the Communist system cannot be adapted, either politically or economically, to any other, and intercourse between two States, one Communist and the other not, will be found in practice to be well nigh unworkable.In these circumstances the Foreign Office finds itself in a position of no small difficulty. It has no desire to oppose trading relations with Russia on their own merits. But, as things are at present, it sees itself expected to enter into relations with a State which makes no secret of its intentions to overthrow our institutions every? where and to destroy our prestige and authority, particularly in Asia. The agents of this policy have been permitted to remain for months in this country and to reap all the advantages of prolonged intercourse with our commercial world, while we, so far from getting any quid pro quo, have had to endure the indignity of watching our nationals detained under abominable conditions in Russia and our Asiatic interests openly and systematically attacked.It seems to me, therefore, that we are certainly justified in demanding as a preliminary to trade relations very definite evidence that Bolshevik hostility shall cease now. We have given abundant evidence of our fidelity to our assurances in respect of Wrangel, Poland, and in other quarters. Can the Bolsheviks produce a single case of suspended hostility or countermanded propaganda in any part of the East ? On the contrary I could, but for the fear of wearying the Cabinet, produce overwhelming evidence that the one objective at which the whole of their policy is and has been aimed is India, and I firmly believe that the renewed lease of life which the agreement if concluded will give them, will be consecrated to no purpose more unswervingly than to the subversion and destruction of the; British connection with the Indian Empire.As to the proposals to send a delegation here to discuss the political conditions of the pact, 1 do not think that the moment has come for any such negotiations to be conducted with advantage. They would, if my forecast be correct, rapidly degenerate into a futile and protracted controversy, out of which no good would come. It would be much better that the Soviet Government should have the opportunity, if only for the first time in its career, of proving its good faith and of thus qualifying for closer intercourse at a later stage. This was, I think, the course that was contemplated in our earlier notes.C. op K.November 14, 1920.
