THE ECONOMIC ASPECTS Off THE REPORT OF THE MUM COMMISSION PIT EGYPT.preliminary Memorandum by the Board of Trade.I.        The politioal aspects and consequences of the proposals of Lord Milner!s Commission are so important and far-reaching, that their purely economic effects are liable to be Overlooked. It is proposed in the present note to consider in a preliminary way what safeguards are neocssary for British commercial and shipping interests (and incidentally for the commercial and shipping interests of other civilized countries) if the Egyptian Government is in future to M virtually uncontrolled by (Jreat Britain. 1How far it is really intended to remove British control is not indeed quite clear.    The document signed by the Commission on March 3rd differs very materially from that forwarded to Mr,Scott of the Foreign Office on August 21st after the conversa-tions with the Egyptian Delegates.    It is presumed, however, that the latter of the two documents is that whioh we have now to consider.II.     Tariff and external commercial relations.The British Smpire has a larger interest than any other country in the external trade of Egypt, and the question of the Tariff leviable on imports into and exports from that country, therefore concerns us more nearly than any other Power.In the Appendix to this Paper will be found a detached examination of the statistics of Egypt1s foreign trade, from which it will be seen that more than half the imports of Egypt are derived from the Empire, goods to the value of nearly 22 millions sterling having been imported from the United Kingdom in 1919 and goods to the value of 5f millions from other parts of the Bmpire, out of total imports valued at rather over 47 millions.    Prance, Italy and the United States each contributed between 2 and 3 millions sterling.    learly half the imports from the United Kingdom consisted of Cotton pieoe goods of v&amp;ich only insignifioant quantities were imported from any other soure?Of the exports of Egypt (over 80 per cent, of the value of whioh consist of raw cotton) substantially more than half are directed to the United Kingdom, which relies on Egypt as the   &apos; main source of supply of the finer description of Cotton.    A : substantial and inoroasing quantity of Egyptian Cotton is sent to the United States and France, Italy and Switzerland account for nearly the whole of the remaining consumption of this irticle.    Practically the whole of the export of cotton-seed (which is next in importance to Cotton in the Egyptian export trade) is sent to this Country.At present the Import Tariff of Egypt is for the most part at the rate of 8$ ad valorem, a legacy frcm the previous connection of Egypt with Turkey before the 0$ tariff of the latter country was raised by consent to the present 11$ level. In 1889 and following years a systematic effort seems to ha-ve been made, without much suooess, to secure greater tariff free-dom for Egypt by negotiations with other countries.    The results of these negotiations may be summarised briefly as
follows:- Great Britain consented in 1889 to complete tariff freedom for Egypt except on oertain important grows of articles of speoial interest to British Trade on which the tariff &apos;was*$p he limited to 10$; these articles inoluded most textiles, *yai$&amp; and fabrics, metals, machinery, and oertain other iron and sjfeM goods and ooal, and also, (doubtless at the suggestion of IndM indigo, rioe and oilseeds.    But, to give effect to this oon*&apos;,v cession, the oonsent of the other Capitulary Powers was necessary and eaoh of them struck a bargain of its own,    instria-Hungary, Belgium and Italy successively added new categories to tiie 10$ schedule which enlarged it from 9 to 24 groups of articles, and made it cover two-thirds instead of forty per cent, of, Egyptian imports.(Che Treaty with Germany in 1892 practically included all Important articles in the 10$ sohedule, while France refused or failed for another ten years to oonolu&amp;e any Treaty at all. Ultimately in 1902 France concluded a treaty with Egypt on the basis of a tariff of 8$, whioh practically defeated the whole attempt tt raise the Bgyp^^ tariff.In 1906 Greece and Italy concluded Treaties with Egypt on a similar &quot;basis.ill these Treaties were to continue In force for definite periods and thereafter, subject to twelve months notice. These periods have long expired in the case of the earlier series, but the French Treaty has seven more years to run, and in the case of Italy (whose Treaty, though conducted in 1906, was not. ratified until 1909) there is still an unexpired period of ten years.    The French obstacle to tariff revision is not regarded, by the Foreign Off tee as serious, but the Italian obstacle is * very formidable,Henoe we are in the unsatisfactory position that for ten years Egypt cannot, without Itafyts consent (which is almost oertain to be withheld) raise her tariff above 8$ ad valorem, while at the expiration of that period she can by twelve months1 notice free herself from all tariff restrictions and impose any duties she pleases.    The position during the next ten years will certainly be galling to an Independent Egypt, rtxile that which will arise at the end of ten years may well inspire great anxiety and uncertainly in Great Britain and the oommer-oial world generally.It appears to me that if we have to negotiate with foreign countries on behalf of Egypt to obtain their consent to any of the changes arising out of the proposed new status of Egypt we shall almost certainly hare to offer them some guarantee against excessive tariffs on their trade after 1930, and that in particular the best (perhaps the only) means of persuading Italy to agree to a tariff of 10 or 12 per cent, forthwith would be to extend the period during which the limit shall apply for (say) another ten years, i.e. until 1940.If such an arrangement should be concluded with Italy it would of course be applicable to Great Britain and the other oountries entitled to&quot; &quot;most favoured nation&quot; treatment in Egypt., but it is important if Egypt is in future to possess oomplete control over her commercial relations with foreign countries, that the tariff stipulation should ,be incorporated, not only in treaties with other foreign powers, but in the proposed Anglo-Egyptian Treaty,    Otherwise, if we rely purely on the protec-tion of a &quot;most favoured nation&quot; clause we may have some very
unpleasant oxperiajaoee when. Egypt proceeds to conclude special tariff bargains with other $ottabries.it is assumed above that /the1 Miliier tfommimicdx^riously intend that Egyjot shall have full control over her foreign commercial relations.    This is clearly stated in the original Report, but in the very same sentence it is stated that Egypt &quot;should have the right of concluding treaties of a non-political nature &quot;with the assent of Great Britain&quot; -which would appear to give us the uTTimate&apos; control of Egyptian commercial treaties.    Again, in the later manpran&amp;um of August we read that Egypt will &quot;undertake not to enter into any agreement with a Foreign Power which is prejudicial to British interests&quot;.    If &quot;British interests&quot; are to &quot;bo under-stood to include &quot;commercial Interests&quot; this stipulation, if intended to he effective, involves British control at some stage and in some form over Egyptian oommeroial agreements   , with foreign countries.    On the other hand the foreign Office Memorandum (page 7 paragraph headed w!0rade&quot;) evidently un&amp;er-stanas the Commission to propose full commercial autonomy for Egypt.    The ambiguity certainly needs to he cleared up.As regards Export [Duties, which are now limited to 1$ ad valorem (also a legacy from Turkey under the capitulations)^ we have already, I &quot;believe, concurred in a proposal to raise the limit from ifo to       hut this concession was &quot;blocked by Italy, which insisted in accepting raw cotton.    Here, again, -we might try to get Italy&apos;s assent to 2$ with the offer to extend the period of limitation for another ten years.    It Is certainly desirable to avoid exciting apprehensions of countries which are large consumers of Egyptian cotton that an uncontrolled Egyptian Government will abuse its &quot;freedom by exoessivo export duties on an article of which she has to a- great extent a monopoly, and whioh is becoming more and more essential to Industry.!Ihe anglo Or Egyptian Convention of 1889 already referred to authorised.exceptional tariff arrangements between Egypt and Turkey or Persia.    Any need for such special arraagfcttjeartau has now disappeared, and no such Article should be included in the contemplated Anglo-Egyptian Treaty.presumably the. ordinary stipulations as to national treat-ment of shipping will be inoluded in any arrangement, together with the other stipulations as to trade and shipping generally included In commercial treaties.    (Most of these matters are dealt with in the Convention of 188$, which, however, is not In the most modern form and can be denounced by either side, by twelve months1 notice.)It also seems very desirable to insert the..Article whioh is included in all our recent Treaties with the Uew States and in the Palestinian and Mesopotamian and Syrian Mandates requiring Egypt to adhere to various International Conventions, including, among others, any conventions relating to transit, communications, and equitable treatment of commerce, which may be concluded under the auspices of the I*eague of nations..III.      The Suez Canal.Presumably sufficient safeguards will have to be inserted in any Treaty to guarantee t3ie protection of the..Canal.Zom.f and of course the International Conventions with regard to
the Canal, of whioh the prlnoipal^onee are &quot;perpetual, will he unaffected by the ohange in the status of Egypt.But It Is to be remembered that the Suez Oanal Company?s concession expires in 1968, and the Canal will then fall under the oontrol and ownership of the Egyptian Government.    In thu opinion of the Foreign Offioe the Convention of 1863 regulatir-g the Sweet Water Oanal will probably le held to expire oon-currently.    Obviously this situation gives rise to the grave question as to whether an uncontrolled Egyptian Government is likely to be strong and trustwortty enough to ensure the efficient and impartial working of this great World Highway, It has not been thought safe to entrust the Banube MouthB to the sole oontrol of the riparian States, and the Sues Oanal is of greater international importance than the Danube, while an independent Egypt is likely to be a weaker State than Roumania.    It seems desirable to insert some safeguards in.   , the coming Treaty for ensuring the proper canal management after 1968,is regards the Sweet Water Canal, on which any British garrison will probably depend for its potable water, the difficulty is not merely what will happen when the Suez Oanal Company goes out of exlstenoe (although this is an important point) but whether means oan be found to safeguard the water supply in tiae meantime, s ince the Oanal. passes through. Oairf whioh will, presumably, be outside the Zone occupied by British troops.    The whele qrestion of the SweetJfla^rHliairal needs very careful consideration,IT.      The Nile,It is not quite certain whether the effect of conferring independence on Egypt would be to render the Nile an inter-national navigate waterway within the meaning of the draft Convention about to be discussed by the League of Nations, This question depends on the interpretation of the definition in the draft Convention, especially in relation to the navigable Canal connecting Cairo with Alexandria and to 1fce Assouan  am. Should an affirmative answer be returned, it will be necessary to scrutinise the provisions of this Convention very carefully-in their hearing both on Egypt and on the Sudan, especially with regard to the right of nationals of all States members of the League of Nations to navigate the Nile.    If, on the other hand the answer is negative, it does not seem safe to leave the matter where it is without safeguarding the right of British and Sudanese craft to ply on the Nile within Egyptian territory.    Probably it will be best not to rely on the international Convention (which may or may not be adopted in its present fonn) especially in view of the doubtful statue of the Nile as a navigable International river*    Hence, suitable olauses for t$e purposes indicated above should go in any Anglo-Egyptian treaty,V,     Foreign officials in the Egyptian Servioe.This is not wholly or ma Inly an economic question but it has a very serious eccnomie aspect.    If British Advisers, officials and employees are to be withdrawn or 3iminisbad in numbers, we ought to have stringent guarantees that they will
not be replaced by foreigners of other nationalities.    We may perhaps have to tolerate Egyptian mismanagement of Customs, Railway^ Irrigation and Communications, but it would surely be. intolerable if French, German or other foreign-offioials ware imported to control these services.    !Ehe*e seems nothing in the Milner Commission Report to safeguard uss against this contingency.    It is suggested that a Clause be , inserted giving us priority in the event of Egypt requiring assistance from foreigners in her public servioes, and perhaps precluding; the employment of foreigners of any other national-ity in the&quot; higher branches of the Egyptian Service without our assent.*VI.        This is only a preliminary Koto and   it may be necessary to circulate a supplementary memorandum as the result of further examination.It is possible that some exception to this rule may be necessary in view of existing p^&amp;jagommtB-yfiiihJh^aiioe,    The Foreign Office will tacw about this.

Of this total,  .E.65,441,901 represented the value of raw cotton,  .3.3,013,993 ootton seed.  . .412,477 ootton seed cake and  JB.22,614 ootton seed oil, making 91 per cent, of the total value of exports as yielded by oottfin and its products.    The remainder of the exports included cigarettes valued at  .E.1,032,076, Hides and Skins valued at  .J3.694,595, Sugar valued at  J5.654,646, Leather valued at  .E.570,545, Rioe valued at  550,580, Onions valued at  .E.424.634, Gum arable valued *at  .E. 359j193, Eggs valued at  .12.282,184, Cigarette paper valued at  .E.240,536 and Raw Wool at  . .181,498.As the above-named articles cover 97 per cent, of the export trade, the examination of the countries to which the specified goods were sent will best illustrate the extent and character of the interest of each country in Egypt as a source of supply.
In 1913. the value of the Exports was  ,21.31,513,291 of whioh the leading oountries were credited in the official record with the following amounts in S-.B.., United Kingdom, 13,604-,352, British Possessions 122,455, Germany 4,066,207. Austria-Hungary 1,756,320, Turkey 664,214., Bulgaria 2,405 (or a total for ex-enemy oountries of 6,489,899) France and Algeria 2,705,092, u\SU. 2,484,905, . Russia 2,241,701, Italy 1,012,254, Switzerland 1,012,217, Japan 719,201.    The value of raw and waste ootton exported in 1913 was  .12.25,516,418, of ootton seed       3,294,813, of cotton seed cake  .B.295,796, and of ootton seed oil  .E.38,058.    The proportionate share of cotton and its products in EgyptTs export trade in 1913 was thus 92 per cent.     The general distribution of the export trade was as stated below.Value in Thousand        of iilxports in 1913.	United	British! France					Articles	King-	Domin-	and	Italy	owiTJzer-1 and.	U.S.A.

Of the exports in 1913 to ox-Enemy oountries, cotton and cotton seed account for  .33. 3,910,677 of the exports to Germany and  .E. 1,584,115 of those to Austria-Hungary, leaving  .B. 155,610 to Germany and  .E. 172^878 to Austria-Hungary of other goods, figures which include  .E. 87,986 and        45,911 respectively from cigarettes. &apos;    ice was the prinoipal export to Turkey, hides and skins being also an important item.$or a comparison of the position in 1919 with that in 1913, thero is no other course available than to assume that the trado with ex-enemy countries, so far as it has not been simply killed, has been distributed among the remaining countries recipients of Egyptian exports.    De-ducting ? therefore, the value of exports to the ox-enemy group, we find that 55 per cent, the remainder was con-signed to British Empire countries.     France stands in the record for 11 per cent. U.SaA. for 10 per cent., Italy and Switzerland oach for 4 per cento and Japan for 3 por cent.In 1919 the British Enpire!s share of Egyptian exports was 54 per cent, in spite of the development of direct shipment of cotton to the U.S.A. which gave that country an interest measured by 22 per cent, in value of Egyptian exports, while Prance and Algeria were enteied   on the record for 8 per cent., Italy for under .5 per cent, and Switzerland and Japan each for z\ per cent.
ii) Imports into Egypt.The value of the Imports into Egypt in 1919 was  .E. 47,402,319, and of this total the United Kingdom con-tributed  .E. 21,837,890 and the British Empire   other than the United Kingdom  .E. 5,766,332.    (Che Countries next in order, with the values consigned from each to Egypt, stated in  .E. were. United States, 2,889,749, Italy 2,512,028, franco 2,447,809, Greece 1,893,105, Japan 1,729,164 and Ohina 1,317,270.She principal classes of commodities imported in 1919 were valued in  .E. as follows:- Cotton piece goods, 11,087,457, Coal 3,001,021, Tobacoe leaf 2,856,472, Kerosene 1,710,897, Cotton manufactures ether than piece goods 1,694^873, Silk Yarn and manufactures 1,665,326, Manufactured, Iron and Steel, 1,430,705, chemical manures (mainly Chili Nitrate) 1,425,746, Cotton Yarns, 1,395,399, Woollen and worsted cloths and mixtures 1,125,330, Meat fresh or refrigerated, 942,838.    These articles made up 60 per oent. in value of the imports.

Egypt from all sources were ralna&apos; *t- .E. 27,326,881, including  .E. 6,324^210&quot; from..e^*-development countries II       (Turkey 2,716,320, Austria-Hungary, 1,940,340, Germany 1,608,881,Bulgaria 58,678), and  .B. 21,502,662 from other countries.     Of the latter the chief were the following, the values of imports of merchandise being stated in  .B:- United,.Kingdom-8,470f443, British Possessions 1,985,477, France and Algeria 2,576,098, Italy 1,473,033, Belgium 1,177,998, Russia.890,866,-Greece 528,195, U.S.A. 525,160. Imports from Japan were only  .E. 70,704.Thus, of imports from other than ex-enemy countries, the share of the British Empire in 1913, according to the Egyptian accounts, war 48.6 per cent., while in 1919 it was 58.2 per cent.     The share cf France was 12 per cent, in 1913 and 5 per cent, in 1919, that of Ital% 7 per cent, in 1913 and somewhat over 5 per cent, in 1919.   Greece, U*S.A. and Japan have all increased their share of Egypt ls import trade, while imports from Belgium and Russia have greatly declined.The classification of the trade in 1913 does not permit of a statement precisely parallel to that given above for 1919, but the following table shows the distribution of the trade by principal commodities and leading countries.Value in thousand  .E. of Imports in 1913.British&quot;&apos; Possess-ions.Articles.Shited KingdomiPrance and Algeria,Italy.U.S.A.Ex-enemy countries.Cotton piece gOO iSo ............Got on yarn and thread............Fabrics wholly of wool..............Silk yarn, piece goods, lace* &amp;c..

lbationalityof Vessels,(iii)   Shipping at Egyptian Ports.The table whioh follows shows the numbers and net tonnage of vessels recorded at Egyptian ports in 1919;   The dominance of the British flag is somewhat less than might have been expected from the preceding tables,   The excess of arrivals over departures with cargo is presumably related to the sailing of a larger proportion of British (and American) vessels than of other vessels without cargo, these vessels having brought coal to Egypt.   The tonnage of goods landed or loaded wa3, it will be notod, not in the same proportion to ship tonnage for all flags.Similarly, in the table showing entries and clearances by Countries, the proportion of oargo tonnage to net tonnage of the vessels carrying it is markedly less for some of the countries specified than for the general average of all countries or for others of the prinoi-pal countries specified.Year 1919.Steamers Entering at and Clearing from Ports in Egypt,Entered with cargoNo., of Steam-ers.* *British , American French Greek .., Italian ,apanese Gther Nation-Personalities ..fcOTiL ....649 37 56 99179 421591, 221Net Registered Tonnage.Tons of cargo dis-charged.1,123,559 04,940 153,367 66,680 306,069 91,184166,8381,992,6371,556,755 47,561 9,562 15,371 34,683 99,431130,9211,894,284Cleared with cargo.No. of Steam-ers.579 33 55 108 196 461781,195Net       Tons of Registered    cargo.
