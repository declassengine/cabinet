Montagu in examining the recommendation became much impressed by the strategical objection to making communicatioi with India dependent on a station at Octro, and as the maintenance of a safe system of communication between England and India is by no means merely an Indian interest, he caused letters to be addressed to the for Office and Admiralty with a view to ascertaining whether the Secretary of War and the First Lord of the Admiralty agreed with him in considering communication with India via Egypt objectionable *
Copies of the letters and enclosures to the &apos;%ar Office ^nd Admiralty and of the replies received from these Departments are enclosed.It vill be seen that both Departments desire that the Cabinet decision above   referred to should again be reviewed with the objects, if possible, of substituting (1) a scheme providing for direct wireless communication between this country and India, and (?,) a private Company for Government in regard.to the installation of the scheme,. The &quot;  r Office, as Is natural, lay emphasis on (1) and the Admiralty are concerned with ( ) alone.In Ft o -Iontagu&apos;s opinion the stra tec leal consideration is necessarily oredominant. and he is satisfied that, provided the technical difficulties to direct communication are not insuperable (and the Army Council agree with the Indian Government&apos;s technical adviser in believing that they can be overcome), direct communication should be established, more particularly in view of the constitutional changes foreshadowed in ^gypt.   ,Apart, however, from the strategical consideration and not necessarily dependent on adoption of direct communication, Mr. Montagu wishes strongly to emphasise the following objections in present circumstances to Government undertaking the responsibility of erecting and work ina* thn Installation required for on Imperial wireless scheme (1)     Difficulty In finding money. (2)     Difficulty In finding trained personnel. (3)      he likelihood of delay.arising from (1) and (2) and also from the negotiations (and perhaps litigation) which would be required in order to enable Government to use necessary patents to which the Marconi Company lay claim.   Delay is particularly harmful to Indian interests as the tfronch -are pressing on with their ^ondicherry station.
Mr. Montagu would therefore urge th*t, the. qi.ior.tion of direct oommun lent ion between England and India should be further reviewed nt once.     In any cane, whether or not direct communication is finally decided upon, it will in Mr. :iOntnguts opinion bo most desirable, for tho reasons stated above, that the installation of tho scheme should be carried out through the agency of a private Company rather tlmn by Covernm-n t.I nm, Sir,Secretary, Your obedtont Servant,Offices of the Cabinet.(Sd.)

list-&quot;?-?-.&apos;(a)Despatch from Government of India to secretary of State for inuia 3i?o.2l of 1920.To The Right Honourable rdwin Lontagu, yia Majesty&apos;B Secretary of State for India,0 overran ent of India,Department cf Commerce.Tele raphs. Simla, the 20th Kay, 1920.Sir,v&apos;e have the honour to state that w. have considered your tele-fr^m FC-246B, dated October 30th, 1919, and the apapers received with your public TJrorks secretary&apos;s letters Fo. P.W. 4557, dated November 12th, 1919 (secret) and Ho. P.W. 1006-20 dated April 1st, 192o, and have already communicated cur ccnelusions t&apos;i you in cur telegram Fo. 312, dated April 23rd, 1920.   We are in entire agreement with the views of Lord lilner and cf the Admiralty as to the urgency cf establishing a high power wireless telegraph station in India for communication with the United Kingdom.   The congestion of the Eastern Company&apos;s cables and the interruption of the Indo-Eurcpean route have&apos; given rise to delays in telegraphic communica-tion between India and the   United Kin ;d.cm which are a source of  . greet inconvenience both to us and tc the public   The development of post-war trade calls for a great extension in our avenues of oommnication with the united Kingdom.   The growth :f aviation and the maritime requirements of the Indian jnmpire also impel us to take up this question.   In the printed&apos; proposal of the Marconi Company which you have transmitted to us it is suggested that three main trunk stations should be set up in India; one apparently to communicate with pnglana, one with &apos;:,gypt and one with Singapore.-For the present, we lay stress on the first station only.   It is of the highest importance to us that a method of communicating direct with the United Kingdom should be established as scon as possible which is not capable of bring permanently interrupted in times of war or disturbance.
2.   m cur telegram dated September 4th, 1919. we stated that our requirements would be met &quot;by one bi^h power station at ,-Poona owned and worked by us.   But, for the reasons given in the Admiralty&apos;s memorandum dated October 15th, 1,919, we now think that strict adherence to this principle would pause a disastrous delay. We understand that no Government department is in existence which has at its disposal either the staff or the experience to erect a high power station such as we require, and we, therefore, agree that the situation can best be met by enlisting private enter-prise for the erection of the necessary station.   This course will relieve us also from difficulties which might arise in connection with patents owned by private firms and with finding the necessary capital for so large a scheme.   We agree also that if the station is erected by a private company, it should also be operated by the staff of the same ccmpany under Government control, subject to certain conditions which we mention below.   -I-t--should he understood however, that if we permit the station to he worked by private enterprise, we should impose conditions with regard to personnel similar to those mentioned in the Marconi Company&apos;s proposal Under the heading &quot;Organisation of personnel15 (pa-;:e 9) .   Y;&apos;e also ijhink that if we exercise our option under olause 5 of Llr. Isaacs&apos; letter dated February 26th, 1920, of taking over this station, we should retain the right to the free use of all patents which the contracting company or its affiliated companies may possess or control and to such information or advice with regard to the use of such patents as the company may be in a position to afford us for so long a period as we continue to pay the royalty mentioned In that clause.3.   our proposal is, therefore, that a high power station should be erected in India by a private company, and swned and operated by them subject to certain conditions which we propose to embody in a license.   The conditions suggested by Mr. Isaacs in his letter dated February 26th, 1920, read in conjunction with his . printed proposal,  seem to uo to &quot;be generally acceptable, but there are one or two additional points on which we desire to layO -f 0-&quot; /&quot; Q
4.   m the fir at place, a hi gh power-statd^n^J^ ting direct with the United Kindlon would be of no use to us unless-a reciprocating station is at the same time established in the United Kingdom,   We anticipate that the volume of traffic will be suoh that a special reciprocating station for India   will.be necessary,   in the interests of economy and smooth working we think that it would be convenient that the reciprocating station should be erected and operated by the same company as erects and operates the station in India.   We suggest, therefore, that the establishment of suoh a station in the United Kingdom should be made one of the conditions of the contract.5.   in addition to the conditions suggested by Mr. Isaacs, we should wish to reserve power tc- fix the maximum rate per word chargeable to the public under the license, and to secure, if possible,  special rates for Government traffic.   We would also mention that masts were erected and plant prepared atKirkee in connection with the pre-war imperial wireless scheme which has &quot;been in abeyance for the last 5 years,   it will be convenient if the ocmpany undertaking to ereot the new station would&apos;also agree to take over this plant at a valuation.   As you are aware, we have undertaken to develop a system of internal wireless commu-communication between different stations in India, and we think it possible that the company to whom this contract is given might agree tc supply us with the apparatus required for these new stations on reduced terms below the ordinary trade prices,Co   subject to these general conditions, we should be glad if negotiations could be opened as soon as possible with some contracting company which has already apquired practical experience rf long distance commercial traffic, and we trust that you will keep us informed of the progress of these negotia-tions.We have the honour to be, Sir,Your most obedient, humble Servants,(HMSFORD.

Memo r andum f.rom lt. Colonel Adrian Simpson to the SeoreTary&quot;&quot;oiT^Eate Tor*Inoia.T\ 77, Ashley-Garuens,Westminster,London, S.W, 1To the Right Honourable $dwin ^onta^uHis Majesty a secretary of state for India.Prom it. colonel Adrian Simpson, C.M.G.,Director of Tireless Telegraphs, India.Sir,Referring to previous correspondence between the Cavern-ment of India and His Majesty&apos;s secretary of state regarding the erection of a high power wireless station in India, and with particular inference to the despatch from the department tf Cemraeroe No. SI of the 2cth May, 1920* X have the honour to bring to your notice certain points in connection with the Report of the imperial Wireless Telegraphy Committee, recently submitted to the Cabinet, which I am of opinion should be very carefully considered before the Government of India consents to adopt the course of action therein recom-mended.   I must express my regret for addressing this commu-communication direct to H.M, Secretary ef State instead of through the usual channels and beg ts point out that I have only taken this course owing to the urgency of the situation and, , since I am at present in England on extraordinary leave, to avoid the delay of forwarding my comments to India in the first instance.2.     The report of the Imperial wireless Telegraphy committee under sir Henry Norman is a very exhaustive une and whilstI have no doubt that, from the committee&apos; a point of view,the arguments they have adduced and the recommendationsthey have made are correct, I nevertheless do not oonsiderthat the conclusions arrived at are either confirmed bythe evidence or in the best business or strategical interestsof   the Indian Government.   It is already the settled policyof the Government of India to improve telegraphic ,&amp;ommunioa-are ,tions with the United Kingdom,   our cables/at present
overloaded.   Their rates arc high, and the delays are serious. We may agree without further argument that the t?o tabliRlruent of direct wire].ess commercial communication between $nglani and India as soon as possible is most desirable, if it is feasible and if the oost is not too prohibitive.   1 propose to divide my comments into three parts - Feasibility of direct communication - pinanoial aspeot - summary and recommendations.3,   prom a commercial p6int of view it is obvious that reliable communication direo-^ with the United Kingdom is of infinitely greater value to India than indirect (iommunication via Egypt,   indirect communication via % third station means re-transmission,. whioh in turn leads to loss of time, congestion of traffio and increase in errorc.   In addition, it means that the coat per word, to and fvam India, would have to re divided between three stations instead of . two, thereby entailing a corresponding less of revenue to the Indian station of ever 16 per cent cf the. total revenue earned by the service.   From a strategical point of view the reliability of the entire soheme of communication to India and beyond, as recommended by the committee, depends upon the Cairo station.   If this were tc be put out of action during a period of emergency and at a time-when the cables were inoperative, communication with the 3)ast wculd be entirely cut off.- such an occasion might easily ariBe and similar conditions actually did obtain in the early part of 1919 when urgent private messages by cable were taking a month in transit and Government &quot;olear lire&quot;messages were occupying four dye., 4. , Nowhere in tho Committee Heport is it stated that communication between India and the United Kingdom is impracticable,   on the contrary the&quot;Repsrt quotes numerous instances of existing lines of communication over distances approximate 4,000 miles and upwards, whilst,
at the same time,, it admits that it has no knowledge ofthe financial results of existing long range wireless services.   Again, on page 10 of the Report it is stated that-500 KJ. station 0could &quot;be expected to give a moderate&quot;but not an uninterrupted service.   It is to he remarked,&quot;however, that the service supplies by an equal station&quot;in India transmitting to England could be expected to&quot;be reasonably good, 3ince the atmospheric disturbances-&apos;&quot;prevalent in England Can be largely eliminated.&quot;5.   Two points arise out of this latter statement:(l) what is &quot;a moderate but not an uninterrupted &quot;service&quot; ?   and(2) It would seem from what is left unsaid that theCommittee is of opinion that whilst the atmospheric disturbances prevalent in England can be largely eliminated, those prevalent in Inaia can not;Both these points are of the very greatest importance and in reality fox^ the crux of the whole situation.   To take these two points in order * &quot;What is a satisfactory commercialv/ireless service ?   In their definition of what a satisfactorycommercial wireless service should be the committee&apos;sreport states (para,9 pa^e 5) that &quot;if the service aims atbecoming&quot; eelf-supporting, while offering low rates to the&quot;public, sufficient paying traffic must ultimately be&quot;secured to keep the stations occupied for practically 24 hrs.&quot;a day at high speed&quot;.   On the accuracy of the latter partof this statement hangs the whole fabric of the committeesreport and as the question is one of paramount.importanceI propose to examine it in detail.6.   On page 14 of the Report, in speaking of direct com-munication or what is termed the 1-step system (vide para. 22), the committee bases its estimate on a speed of 30 (thirty) words per minute.   For the purposes of calculation we may accept this figure although it is considerably lower than that which certain commercial companies are prepared to specify (vide para. 19 of the report).   Assuming this to be the theoretical speed, and again accepting the committee&apos;s
statement in the footnote to pare 14 of the report, that the actual output is only -%% of the theoretical oapaoity, we arrive at a figure of 12 paying words per minute - that is to say, a total capacity cf 24 paying words per minute in &quot;both directions, ac Burning of ccurso that the service is duplex, i.e. simultaneous transmission and reception in both directions.   Furthermore, to allow for what the Onrmittee*designates as &quot;a moderate but not an uninterrupted service&quot;,7I am calculating cn only forty (4o) minutes actual working in the hour and.cn only eleven (11) hours wcrkinj in the twenty four,  so ae to afford an additional   margin of safety against atmospherics,,. repetitions, interruptions for adjustments etc.   Thin gives us 24 x -1-1 x 11* 10,560 paying words per day, allowing for an additional margin rf safety of over 3o% for interruptions etc. or say3.;J168j Opo paying worols jper annur^ of 300 work days. How taking the present traffic between India ana the United Kingdom the average cost, after allowing for state messages, press etc. works out at (l/6d.) one shilling and sixpence per. word.   If then we accept the assumption of the Committee that, the wireless rate would b*a three fourths cf the existing oable rates,  the average wireless rate would work out at 1-1,25 shillings per word, giving us a revenue of 3,168,000 x 1.125 shillings per, working year of 300 days, or say 17 8, 2 Q Q p e r a nnu m -Again, accepting tho committee1s estimate of the annual cost of the stations for a l-etep system at  155,000 after allowing for maintenance, interest on capital and complete amortisation, we obtain, not a loss, but a profit of 2^J200^ JpeJ^num^ And this in the case of &quot;a moderate ana not an uninterrupted service &quot;working at only 3o words per minute theoretical speed 7.   It may be objected of course that a proportion of this traffic wculd be transit traffic in respect ef whioh
only stl portion of the cent per word could be credited to the Indian station.   This is of course true but it is equally true and self-evident that the more stations you have to employ between any two points, the less profit there is per station, owing to the necessity for re-transmi ssion and the -increased operating cost of the system,   it fallows therefore that, for a given amount of traffic,  any system which includes an unnecessary multiplication of stations and consequently of re-transmissions, reduces the earning capacity of each individual station.   Thin is why the system recommenced by the.committee shows an estimated loss of  100,000 per annum (vide para. 46 of the repqrt) owing to repeated handling of the 3are message before it reaches its destination.8.   I contend therefore that I have proved conclusively from the figures and estimates supplied by the Committee&apos; itself,  that the definition of a satisfactory commercial wireless service as given in the Report is incorrect and that, for a wireless service to be self-suppertin4, it is not necessary for the stations to be occupied &quot;for practically 24 hours a day at high speed&quot;, provided always that dir:ct communication can be established without the necessity for intermediate stations.   This point is of vital importance as it would obviously be baa business on the part of the Indian Government to subscribe to a scheme which is&apos; calculated to produce a loss.when direct communication, if it is feasible, would produce a profit and be more advantageous in every.way.
9.     I now come to my second point (vide 5 above) viz: atmospheric disturbances. Pag: 10 para. 14 of the Heport implies by virtue ef omission, that whilst atmospherics can be largely eliminated in England this is not the case in India. Again, emphasis is laid on tbis point in para. 34 where it is stated that India is one of the worst sufferers from this cause.    It would be interesting to know on what authority these statements have been made for it is only during the last few months that any serious research work has been imitiated In India with modern a-pparatus.&apos;   It is true thqt in the past very serious interruption to wireless communication has been experienced but this has been largely due to the use cf       obsolete or obsolescent apparatus.   Until a thorough investigation of this question hc.s been carried it is certainly impossible to state in percentages the amount of freedom from 1 atmospheric disturbances1 that can be reached but it is mvjrjXky certain, frcm the little that has already been done, that the use of continuous waves and modern receiving arrangements can undoubtedly effect a very toarked improvement.   It should also be remarked that for Beven months in the year little or no serious trouble is experienced from this cause.   I have qualified my remarks regarding the desirability oi&apos; direct communication with India by the words &quot;if it is possible&quot;.   Throughout the report no evidence has been produced by the Committee that direct communication is impracticable; on the contrary estimates have been given oi cost and oi speed oi working lor stations which &quot;could, be expected to give a moderate but not uninterrupted service&quot; which, as has been demonstrated in jera. 6 above, is more than sufficient to provide a profit instead of a loss.   Consequently the point upon which the report lays such stress, namely that there is no feign speed commercial wireless service working tooay over a long range, loses much of its force, especially as the Committee admits that it has-no knowledge
of the fuiidaioejital yaesti-on, vis: the financial results of existing long range wire!es ^services (vide Para. 9 of the report)   i4rom the evidence before us ano from para. 11 (b) page 6 ox the report which&apos;describes the service of certain of the Trench and American long range stations as &quot;excellent and fairly regular&quot;, there is only one conclusion to be drawn, namely that direct communication between the United kingdom   nti India ia perfectly feasible, provided a 24 hour high speed service is not demanded, and this has already been shown to be unnecessary Iran a profit earning point of view.10.     As regards the relative advantages oi the arc, the high frequency machine ana the valve, beyond stating that I personally do not agree with the statement made in ^ara.16 of the report that the ,1958-59 system would unquestionably be chosen for the service under consideralien i do not propose to labour this document with technical discussions.   In my opinion the superiority oi one or the other systems, in any given circumstances, can only be decided after all the evidence on tne question has been properly silted by competent authorities,        far as I am aware&apos;the Liarconi Company is the only British company which has practical experience in long distance wireless commercial communication and, having regard to the rapidity with which this science is developing, any decision on this point can only be regarded t-&amp; prapture until that company&apos;s evidence has been taken. lie     1 inaneial jispect.     I now wish to consider the vital question of finance.   rhe Government of India has already had before it a proposal ior semiring a high power station capable oi communicating direct with the United kingdom where their expenditure would have been limited to some  130,000.   This proposal would have given the Government complete control.   For financial reasons however it was decided to resort to private enterprises whilst adhering,to the policy
oi ultimate state control.   In tho proposals contained in the com;ittee&apos;s report I see no reason to Of-use the Government of India to deport from the policy expressed in its telegrun NqA&apos;31E of April  3rd&quot; 1920 aid confirmed later by its despatch Mo. 21 of  Oth :..ay 1  0.   On the one h:.,.nc the report of the Committee recommends a capital expenditure of some .:185,000 by the Government of India and indicates further an annual recurring loss of some .:4,0000   On the other h:.nd, ii the policy recommended b; the Indian Government in its despatch No.21 oi 1920 is adhered to, India will acquire a high power wireless station, capable of direct communication with the United hinge oin, in return for no capital or recurring expenditure whatever,,   koreover, there is nothing to prevent the Government from exercising its option and&quot; taking over the station, should it be d sirous oi doing so, at a later date.   In other words by accepting tho recommendations contained in the First Lord&apos;s mom or-nr-urn from the admiralty to the ..ar Cabinet dated 15th October 1919 anc&quot; by giving effect to the proposals contained in its despatch So;21 of 1920, the Government oi India has everything to gain and nothing to lose, for even if the contracting company fails to give a reliable servioe with the United Kingdom the station will certainly be capable of giving a reliable service with . gypt and the proposals of the Committee will have been fulfilled. 12.   In these ciroumstanoes it would obviously be bad business to embark on a large capital expenditure to acquire a 2000 mile range station when we can get a station for nothing that will probably do 4500 miles and will certainly do 2000 miles.   Ilnally, the more doubt that exists regarding the reliability of the service, the less reason for the Government to embark on a considerable capital expenditure when private enterprise can be found willing to undertake the risk en acceptable terms.
Summary and Recommendations.

In conclusion I may summarise my remarks as follows:

(l) That it is conclusively proved from the figures of the Committee that the definition contained in the Report viz: that a satisfactory wireless commercial service must be a service occupied for practically 84 hours a day at high speed in order to become self-supporting, is entirely erroneous and misleading (vide paras. 6 to 8 above)

(2) That the direct scheme of communication even at a low speed is a far more satisfactory business proposition for India than a high speed scheme involving intermediate stations and consequent re-transmission (vide paras. 7 and 11 above)

(3) That the feasibility of such a service is established (vide para. 9 above)

(4) That the scheme of communication suggested by the Committee is strategically unsound from India&apos;s point of  view (vide para. 3 above)

(5) That the Committee&apos;s statement regarding the relative superiority of the are system for direct communication between Indi? and the United Kingdom is far from established (vide para.10 above)

(6) That the Committee&apos;s report has left practically untouched the vital question of patents end royalties that may be payable thereon - and particularly those covering the use of thermionic valves.

(7) That the principle cited by the Committee in lines 5 to 8 of para. 7 of the ?oit, is contrary to the accepted policy of the Government of India.

(8) That the Committee&apos;s recommendations are in direct opposition to those of the Admiralty as expressed in the admiralty memorandum dated 15th October 1919 addressed to the War Cabinet by the First Lord. In
In this memorandum the Admiralty represented that in view of the expense and lack of technical knowledge, ownership and control of long distance wireless stations cannot at presont be adequately exercised by Government^  further, while supporting stales ownership and control as the ultimate aim, they propose that the strategic and commercial requirements of the l&amp;apire be met by causing private enterprise to erect and work the ftatione under Government control and on condition that Government may take over the stations at a later date *A copy of the above-mentioned memorandum was before the Government ef India when their despatch No*$lH&amp;-H 1920 was drafted,(9)   $hat the (government of India has everything t$ gain and nothing to lose by adhering to the policy expressed in their despatch Bo.21 oi 1920 and that even if the contracting company fails to give the direct serV&amp;ot required the proposals of the Committee, will have been fulfilled as regards comimi^oatien via Sgypt*1 BECOBaMI), in the Interests *f the Iniia&apos; $OYtrxiftftirfctmm Bvm mm ma mm    cmimm m Ctirm otboi 20 wra w ieust possible1 havt etcAdrian Simpstn Director *t Wireless 5!elseXjndgnJLltb.

On thewhole, we think it would bo bettor if recommendations made in ourDespatch dated 20th hay last wero adopted, and negotiationsinstituted with private.firms.
