Soviet Russia contains the following points of Naval interest:-(1)   The general .limit of territorial waters in the gulf of Finland is placed at four miles In spite of British request for three mile limit.(2)   Territorial   limits in Petohenga district are not yet defined.(3)   By Article 17 free passage to Petrograd is granted to Finnish merehant vessels.(4) Finnish Government state it is only a provisional treaty and that it would probably be considerably changed before ratification.Seven Russian Motor Boats, which have been in Finnish Harbours since completion, have been transferred to Stockholm for sale.

Sweeping opera-tions by T,B.D/&apos;s and trawlers are reported in the Finnish&apos; Gulf between Narva and Reval.    The crews of these craft organise night raids against peasantry to obtain food and plunder; Intermittent skirmishes with casualties occur nightly along the coast,Bolshevik. Naval Committee q equivalent to our Board of Admiralty, has been reformed.     Smirnoff is President, the remaining members are&quot; of obscure origin with no naval experience but with strong political influence.    The Committee have issued following orders concerning Naval Ensigns and Colours :;;-Military Soviet War Flag: Red, bearing letters R.S.F.S.R.in p:old in top corner. Naval Service Flag: Red with large white anchor in centre,with a red star in centre of anchor with lettersR.S.F.S.R, In white, apparently on the stock of anchor. Mercantile Marino 111 lag;: Same as Soviet War Flag, but lettersin white in the centre of flag, and no anchor.Note:- The prominence given in all Bolshevik heraldry (sic) to the Star of Judah is of interest.
esthonia.S*S. &quot;Wasa&quot; has been seized by Government and found to contain large quantities of propaganda destined for England, France and America.    This ship has been suspect for some weeks. Her nationality is not clear as there is a Finnish, Bsthonian and Swedish ship of this name trading in the Baltic.LATVIA.Latvian Government reports that ships should not enter area between 56 degrees 55 N. and 56 degrees 45 N. and 20 degrees 46 E. and 20 degrees 56 E. owing to minefields called Stein Ort, reported by fishermen.The question of sweeping Latvian territorial waters is before the League of Nations.     The principle of Latvia doing this work for herself has been noted.B o .1 s hey.13r. S ubmar In e s.No further reports as to proposed operations against Danzig shipping have &quot;been received.     Krassin, on behalf of the Soviet&apos; Government has presented a further Mote in whioh it is stated that(1)   Russian Government are obviously anxious for peace. ,(2) Stringent orders have been given to all Russian warships in no circumstances to take any hostile action against British ships *(3)   Bolshevik Submarine operations to be   limited to the ^lack Sea against General&apos;WrarpelVs ^leet, and against any ships of the allies which may participate directly in any hostile act against Soviet Russia.With regard to (3) above, attention is drawn to the inability of Bolshevik Submarine Commanders to distinguish between Allied and Wrangells ships *    In addition, owing to lack of discipline and probable German direction, the personal animus of a Bolshevik Submarine Commander, makes it all the more possible for them to attempt to torpedo any craft met with.Baltic General.Gun. Running.    Unconfirmed reports have been received, which state that gun-running between German and Saandinavian ports of Helsingborg, Landsorona and Malmo is takinp; place.     Arms are run in small coasting steamers and transferred to Swedish Ocean-going vessels for Irish and South American ports.   Ships mentioned in this connection are :-   German, &quot;Seeraawe&quot;, Belgian, &quot;Antwerpen&quot;, and Dutch &quot;Rebecka&quot;.     Cargoes are expected to be run in November.Bolshevik S.S* &quot;Subotnik&quot;.

British Naval Prisoners 0In acoordance with the agreement with the Bolsheviks, arrangements are proceeding for the exchange of prisoners at Baku via Tiflis and Batoum but the usual policy of procrastina--tion is delaying the &quot;carrying out of the Exchange,   H.l ,Govern-ment are considering what further steps can be taken to hasten matters.A report from Sofia states that 10,200 rifles and 8 million rounds S.A.A. for General Wrangel are being loaded at Varna on the Bulgarian steamer Boris whioh has been requisitioned by the French.The wreck of the Battleship &quot;Imperatritsa Maria&quot; is still in dock at Sevastopol    it is proposed to break her up and sell the scrap *The Battleship&apos;&quot;Alexieff&quot; and Cruiser &quot;Korniloff&quot; are reported to have obtained good gunnery results in the bombarding Operations on the River.Bug.    The former is in a very dirty condition and the orew includes 200 peasants.Wmrl^X^XCl2..    The Bolshevik Government issued by W/T on 19oh October the following instructions for entering &apos; NovorossiskTo a 1?,,,Ewflvr&amp;Q7$.s.*    The people s Commissariat for Foreign Affairs, on the advice of the Naval Command at Novorossisk) informs all Governments of the following regulations dealing with all foreign ships arriving at Novorossisk with prisoners of war.     All these ships must before anything else communicate in good time to the Staff of the Novorossisk Base the date and hour of their arrival, their nationality, the tonnage of the ship1s displacement, the nature o-r the, craft, the call-sign and wave-length of the wireless station on board., which will communicate with our coast station, the wave-length of whioh is.4,000 metres.     All th.ese ships should approach the entrance *. into r!ovorossisk Bay between daybreak and nightfall in such a way as to enter into port in full daylight at the rate of 6 knobs.

They will not receive an answer to this call, but a boat flying the pilot1s flag will receive them and load th^m into port.     The pilot1s flag must be hols-hod on one of the masts of the ship whioh is entering * Should the pilot5 s boat not be sent within three hours of the call, the foreign ship will have to proceed to Jubga (in French DJoubga) Bay, where she must put herself into direct communication with the post there, through whioh she will get from the base staff the necessary indications as to how she is to act.    The Base Staff declines any responsibility for such consequences as may result from the non-observance of the conditions given above.

They also ask that the tonnage of the &quot;Coastguard vessels may be increased to 300 - 400 tons.According to unofficial reports, Bulgaria intends to ask authority to acquire 6 submarines for defensive purposes.A scheme of reorganisation of the Navy propounded by the Bulgarian Minister of War flagrantly violated the Treaty, and he has been requested to prepare another, without delay.He has also been asked for an explanation of the delay in effecting demobilisation of naval personnel.The President of the Commission of Control has protested in energetic terms to the French Minister of Marine regarding the insinoerity and the temporising policy of the Bulgarian Minister for War regarding execution of the Treaty.
The Rumanian Government, has been furnished with all preliminary details of the procedure for handing over to Rumania tho 3 river monitors of the ex-Austro-Hungarian Danube Flotilla which have been allocated to that country.It is understood that Roar Admiral Dumesnil, now C-in-O. o-p the Cruiser Division of the Eastern Mediterranean Squadron will b^ President of the Naval Commission of Control for Turkey,TP D A ft.-riT.(i .

This vessel whioh is 12,000 tons displacement was navigated with accuracy by means of radio waves from the battleship &quot;OHIO&quot;.     The control was thoroughly efficient to a maximum range of 12 miles,The &apos;10\7A&quot; will now be -sed under radio control as battle practice target.
AFGHANS TAK.,The situation or the frontier has net altered. The troops which relieved the Chitral Garrison a^e new returning to India.   Snininr in sVfn ^p-ocrt^d.MESOPOTAMIA,The column from Hillah working southward and tne column from Basra working northward ar* rpetinp&quot; w*th a certain amount cf resistance and have relieved the garrisons at Kufah and Sanawah respectively.   Both garrisons have held cut fa]^predominantly, and the&apos;Kufah garrison were especially severely menaced as the insurgents were using a line of loophole houses which in some Places was within 10 yar^s cf the garrison.   They ?\lso used hnd-prenades and an 18 pdr.&apos; gun which they cartured was brought within 550 yards of the garrison who, however, annihilated the crew by a concentration of nil their Lewis guns.      The casualties of the garrison at Kufah during the siege were 22 killed or died of wounds, 27 wounded and 3 misping.   Of the Hilled 5 were British officers or other ranks including the Assistant&apos;Political Officer, Captain Kami&apos;, and the military officer who was in command of the &quot;Firefly&quot;, Contain Stanley.      The &quot;Firefly&quot; was found completely gutted.     It is estimated that the insurgent forces before Kufah numbered 2,500. , The reliving forces had &quot;H casualties, whilst the insurgents sustained heavy losses .and 40C prisoner? were taken.     The Indian Cavalry inflicted heaw casualties  s they succeeded in engaging a larre party ofthe insurgents in the open.Representatives from Najaf and Kerbala have come in to offer their submission and all the British, and. Indian prisoners&apos; in the h-nds of the Arabs were handed over.The Air Force successfully bombed several con-concentrations of insurgents.British casualties during the whole -period of the disturbance from June 1st to October 1st are reverted to amount to      416 killed or died;   1,119 wounded; 159 prisoners in Arab hands and 475 missing.   It is iiriocssible to estimate the Arab losses exactly, but they are known to have been considerably heavier than our own.&apos; &apos; R TJ S S I A.       &apos;    : &apos;Red Army.    Discontent -dth existing regime continues., to grow, and larg* desertions from the Polish front are reported.- Frantic Propaganda grainst Grange! is reported and tills is the usual pre &quot;Judo to an offensive.trade.    Pending the fulfilment of Bolshevik promises regarding exchange of prisoners rn6 the receipt of a satisfactory reply from the Soviet Government t.o- cut-standing questions, the resumption of Russian Trade negotiations are suspended.    Meanwhile the inabilitycf
of Russia supplying any sort, of corricditv in any appreciable amount is becoming more obvious.   The little * timber and flax available belongs to British and other&apos; firms, who are preparing to legally fight for their goods if any attempt is rede to sell them.   The smell amount of grain whioh has Percolated to Italy is unfit for food, and corroborates our previous information of its having been obtained from stores buried in the ground,CrimeaBThere is no material change,   Wrangel obtained a local success on 17th October n^ar RoEOvka, capturing 600 prisoners and 5 guns.   Enemy pressure has increased on right bank cf Dnieper and General Wrangel has withdrawn to left bank. The situation behind the front linecontinues to improve economically, but  reat hardship continues to be felt by the inhabitants.    The French continue to sunniy rrjritions via Varna.   C-inC. Mediterranean, reports that fruit, tobacco, barley an oats can be exported from the Crimea, but the inherent Russian dilatcriness hampers ouick renewal of trade,Georgia-No material changer   The threat to Batoum Province fore-shadowed by the Bolshevik - Nationalist -Turkish operations continues.   The&apos;Anatolian Coast will no doubt be the centre of Naval interest in the Black Sea for some tine to come. ,The Georgian Government state that repatriated Prisoners of ,,rar cannot be landed at Batoum - it is net clear whether this equally applies to the repatriation of Naval prisoners from Tiflis.Azerbaijan^Sporadic risings against Bolsheviks continue and the whole country is reported to be ready to throw off the Soviet domination at Baku.   On the ether hand, Soviet com-and of the Caspian stabilises their position, and no immediate change can be expected.   Azerbaijan Government have accented Bolshevik proposals to their negotiations with France for exchange of French prisoners at Baku,Caspian Sea.,, .....A bombardment of the coast in the vicinity ofSnzeli is reported.Siberiai * T,,,        ,  .Evacuation of Japanese troops from Habarovsk isactively proceeding.   No&quot; material change.POLAND.The troops commanded by the anti-Bolshevist Generals PaVahowitch and Permykin win net be forced to leave Polish territory till after the ratification of the Armistice and Preliminary Treaty of Riga..   In the meantime the French Military Mission are assisting in re-organising them.There appears to be no doubt that the action of General Zeligowski in seising Vilna was contrary tothe
the wishes of the Polish Government although the Head of the State, Marshal Pilsudski, -as in sympathy %lth it. &apos;The Polish Government have disavowed General z2.^cwskl s action anrl have expressed their intention of abiding by the Armistice with Lithuania concluded undpr the auspices of the League cf Nations.      The tono of the reply is net considered very satisfactory/&apos; 01 tJlCAUSTRIAThe Serbo - Croat - Slovene Government oompleted the evacuation of Klagenfurt on the 23rd October.   J&apos;Danzig\^ .v&apos; oLhS 5a?4^ p^ish Treaty is due for signature on the 25th October. &apos;RUMANIA^A railway strike in Rumania has broken out.   The Prime Minister states that the personnel will be called to military service.   He proposes to let ratters take their course and will withdraw from the strikers the nrivi-leges of cheaper food available for Government employees. A general strike is threatened.TURKEY *Damad Ferid resigned on the 16th October and been replace^ by Tewfik Pasha.The state of affairs remains profound!?/ unsatis-factory and no amelioration can be locked for until rati-fication of the Treaty has been effected rnd the Commissions of Control have taken up their work.HoM. Government hope to ratify the Treaty during&apos; the present Session of Parliament,, ond are pressing the French and Italian Governments to ratify quickly.ARMENIAThe situation on the south-western frontier of Armenia seems to have improved somewhat.   The Turkish forces under Kiazim Kara Bekir, which are estimated at ,some 7,500 regular and 2,000 to 3,000 irregular troops, with 15 guns,&apos; have halted about 30 miles from Kars on the Olbi road and about 20 miles from it cn the Sarikamish road.   The Armenians have assembled strong forces around Kars, -nd are confident cf b^ing able to hold their own against attack.On the pastern frontier the Armenians have pushed forward a force north of Nakhichevan, wkicv has cut the road leading thence to Gerusi, and so menaced the retreat of the Bolshevist forces at the former place.   These latter are now trying tc open a new line cf communication with Baku by Ordubad, but their first attempt to break through by this route was defeated.    This attempt has been assisted by the action of Bolshevist troops which advanced southwards&apos; from Shusha to the Akas Valley, and attacked the Armenian position at Migri (50 miles.south-east of Nakhichevan) from the east at the same tirie as another force attacked from the west.   The Armenians held theirground
ground and i nf Tlot^o1 *twyy. 1 esses on their adversaries, the Red force fron Nakhichevan suffering so severely that it was forced to desist from its attacks on 1 &apos;    &apos; October 2nd, and fall back to Ordubado   It is stated that a Turkish detachment sent to Bayazid to support the Bolsheviks arrived at Nakhichevan on the 5th,There seems little doubt that the Turks and the Bolsheviks have concluded some sort of agreement for common action against the Armenians, who, however, are united in tbpir&apos;resolve to defend their country.   The Armenian Army is foc* and well led, while their equio-ment, largely supplied by tjie Allies,is sufficient and up to ^ate.    Volunteers are coming forward well.ABYSSINIAyThe &quot;Had Mullah&quot; having moved into Abyssinia the British Government are pressing Ras Taffari to take measures for his capture.EASTERN MEDITSPJIA?-7!?! AIt is hoped that all the Russian refugees from Lemnos will have been evacuated by 15th November.Foreign Office have requested th^t garrisons of at least nominal strength may be retained in Lemnos, Imbros, and Tenedos pending ratification of the Turkish Treaty,SPAIN.The King of Spain, accompanied by the Queen and Prince Jaime, were to start on a visit to England on 26th October, but the date of his departure will probably be postponed on account of the strike in England.-:SYRIA.About 1st October a French column of several battalions cf infantry with field artillery, left Aleppo for Deir-ez-Zor, close to the provisional boundary of Mesopotamia, where it is their intention to establish a military pogt,Qilicia.The French Government deny that there is any truth in the rumours that they are evacuating large numbers of Armenians from Oilicia, or that they mean to abandon that country.     On the other hand 900 destitute Armenians, shirped from Mersina, were landed in Constantinople on 14th October, without any warning, or provision being made for their accommodation.CHINA,It is stated that Ohang Tso Lin and Tsao Kun ha^p demanded menpv to increase their private armies by &quot;about 100,000 men, and that the former is forcibly   ^ transferring all the aeroplanes, plant, and hangars, eto: supplied by Vickers and Han&amp;T^-Page from Peking to   .
