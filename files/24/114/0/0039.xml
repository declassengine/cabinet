Loon Bourgeois, and two of his colleagues, the Spanish and Japanese Ambassadors in Paris, were instructed to follow the execution of this recommendation,     By their efforts a military co commission of control composed of five officers of different nation-Personalities was established without delay, and was able to begin.fits labourb on the spot on October 4th.This/
oCommission, to which the Council desires to express its best thanks, f^und that its authority was accepted by both parties, brought about in the district of Suwalki tho retreat of the Polish and Lithuanian troops, to a distance of 6 kilometres on either side of the lino of December P, and on October 7 succr-eded in securing the acceptance of an armistice along, the whole front, and an extension towards the east of the line of demarcation, owing to the positions then occupied by the Lithuanian and Polish troops.     At the same time the Committee of the Council kept in constant touch with the re-presentatives of Poland and Lithuania, HIvL Paderewski and Voldomar, received, their complaints, and Intervened to secure the immediate removal of certain grievances, for instance, when the Lithuanians complained of difficulties placed in the way of their communications across the Polish Corridor. Two circumstances, however, entirely changed theaspect of the problem placed before the Council.     On tho one\hand the Polish troops drove the Soviet Army from Grodno, and then from Lida, and soon an armistice accompanied by Peace preliminaries was signed at Riga between Poland and the Soviet^ Kepublie.     On the other hand, on October 8, General Zellgow-ski, at the head of a Polish division, enucred Vilna and pro-claimed a Go-vernrnent called that of Central Lithuania.     In a Hote addressed to      Paderewski, to be forwarded to his Govern-ment and in a communication to the press, M.
