$ IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJRSTYfS GOVERMENT).pentialttj?    ! C A B IN E T,204O.LEAGUE   OF   NATIONS AALAND ISLANDS.Report by Mr. Balfour presented to and adopted by the Council of the League of Nations Meeting in Brussels on October 20th, 1920.4tt*OH.  ...*!..  ....(Circulated for information&apos;.).4In the course of their last meeting at Paris my colleagues on the Council decided to accept the Report of the Committee of Jurists whom they had invited to furnish them with an opinion on two legal points raised in the course of the Aaland Islands disputeJ-The first point referred to the question whether the status of the Aaland Islands was, or was not, a matter solely within Finnish domestic jurisdiction; and the second referred to the actual position of the Aaland Islands under international law, having regard to the stipulations of the treaty of 1856.This Commission reported that, in their opinion, the question of the Aaland Islands could not be regarded as being solely a matter of Finnish domestic jurisdiction, and that the Council were therefore competent to deal with the matter at issue.&apos;My colleagues having accepted this Report then proceeded to consider what their next st?p should be, and decided that, before they could find themselves in a position to make any recommen-datlons for the settlement of the dispute, they required further information on all those aspects oft the question which were not -jcovered by the juridical opinion with which they had already been supplied.     They therefore decided to appoint a Commission af Rapporteurs to make a thorough study of all the other points involved, taking, into foil account the legitimate interests of every party of the dispute.     It was hoped that such a Report -would enable them to frame a recommendation providing a satisfactory settlement: of this difficult question.It was/
It was further suggested: that a United States citizen should bpnvited to sorvo on the Commission? and a request to this effect has Ileen made to the United States Government. There is every reason io hope that its consent will be given and that they will nominate i representative.The following nominations have already been madeBARON BEYENS - a former Minister for Foreign Affairs in Belgium. M. CALONDER - a former President of the Swiss Federation. SIGNOR MAGGIORINO FERRARIS - Senator of tho Kingdom Of Italy, iho ha^c already on several occasions represented&apos; Italy on the Council it the League of Nations.In anticipation of the appointment of the United States represen-tatlve, th se gentlemen have begun their preliminary studios; and it is-hoped that the whole Commission will proceed at the end of this month to the Aaland Islands, Sweden and Finland, for the purpose of obtaining Information on the spot to assist them in,framing their Report!There is one other point connected with this question which oughtto be mentioned. - A telegram has been received from the Landdtingif the Aaland Islands, which indicates that the Aalanders have notlorrectly understood the Report of the Jurists.     This telegram correctsly states that the Commission of Jurists has ruled that the questionif the Aaland islands is of an international character, but it incorrect-that,y assumes/this ruling recommended the extension to the Aalanders of tho Ight of self-determination.On this point,however, the Commission neither offered an opinion, ior were ashed to offer one,     They confined themselves, as was proper, io a judgment on the purely legal point submitted to , their decision,I would suggest to my colleagues that this be brought to the notice )f the Aalanders, that the object of the League in appointing the further Commission of Rapporteurs should bo explained to them, and that it ihould be made clear that until its Report is received no forecast as c the future sflOtt&amp;omcnt of the dispute possesses the slightest value.We have/
Te have already urged upon the Governments of Sweden and Finland if.to abstain from any action of an irritating or provocative character while the case remained sub judice.     It Is important that a similar request should bo addressed to the Aalanders.     I therefore suggest that a reply in the above sense should be sent by the Council to the Landsting of the Aaland Islands in answer to their telegrams of the 16th inst.2, &quot;whitehall Gardens, S..7.2nd November, 1920.
