regret.decontrol jWJ&amp;pjSls, JSteinorandum by the Pood ControllerI have for some time been considering the.-question of the possibility of the dir.continuance of the operations of the Royal Commission on.Sugar Supplies, and desire the views of the Cabinet upon this matteroThe general position with &quot;regard to supplies and prices of &apos; -&apos;-sugar is quite exceptional, as compared With&apos; &quot;other commoditiesv -The estimated production for the. year 1920-1921 shows a diminution&apos;:.-as compared with the pre-war crops &quot;-of approximately 10 per cent. On the other handy the. average rise in, the price of domestic sugar from July, 1914, to 1st October, 1920, -is $81. per cent.There is no adequate, explanation of, this abnormal.&apos;, rise.&apos;./    -except the speculative movements which have&apos;b,een marked since the , - .-- , Armistice * We can only&apos; -claim.. for tho operations of the Royal&apos; &apos; : Sugar Commission at best a partial success In preventing even greater price   fluctuations&apos;, and a large body of commercial opinion is constantly criticising, tfre Government, upon the ground that complete freedom from.control, would have beon more effective in   &apos; protecting the British, consumer.&apos;     - .. -&apos; /.-,The Royal Commission on &apos;;Sugar Supplies &quot;are themselves anxious. . to hasten the period of de-control, as appears from a Memorandum from the Chairman, a, copy of which is annexed-The original suggestion&apos; of the Royal.&apos;Commission was that while all restrictions on &quot;price or consumption in this, country . - ,  ....should be -removed at an early date, the purchasing operations of ......the Commission&quot;should continue until the 31st Marsh, 1921, in the interests ofthe British refinerso I have, been urged by the British Sugar Refiners; Association that the Sugar Commission ought to continue their operations until at least the end of 1921, on the ground that&apos;their profits have been limited;during control,, and, therefore, they have .had no opportunity of accumulating     ..  ., reserves; that larger&apos;stocks will have -to be carried at much higher prices; that private enterprise will: be wholly unable to meet:the / -.. financial diff1.culi.ies; involved by- the fluctuations - and probable falls in the. price of sugar during the next fifteen months and. that the.. Chancellor of the Exchequerf in August, 1914, promised Government assistance .in the event of de-control in view of. this suggestion, the Royal- Commission now propose to continue their purchas-ing operations&apos; until; such time as it is satisfied that the con-ditions of the world-&apos;s market have reached a point at which the ,      . v-refineries can reasonably be expected to provide themselves with the. requisite raw material: without risk, of interruption in the maintenance, of the sugar supply of. the country&apos;.. -I am satisfied that some provision must&apos; be made for ensuring the continuation of the refining industry in this country until conditions become mere normal $ but from a political point of-view, am not clear that the best means of achieving this end would be to ;:maintain a b.!y which, as already stated^ has been made the subject of considerable public criticism. ,.If the necessity of safeguarding the Refining industry \$ admitted,the question arises whether-that may not necessarily involve some.,resumption cf Government purchases of sugar in 1921, or whether it could.be effected in 3ome other way. for example, by some form of direct financial assistance on the part of&apos;the Treasury. A deed-sion in this question is urgent. &apos; ICABINET
Personally, I should much prefer to see an end of Government buying altogether, and if the alternative suggestion is practicable I think it would bo the preferable solution.If, however, a resumption of buying is found to be an essential means of safeguarding the Refining industry    in the interests not merely of the trade but of sugar consumers in this country I think it important that the public should feel that this policy is continued in the interests of the consumer and not merely as a protective measure, for the trade, and that the responsibility for the policy should be clearly assigned to the Ministry of Pood, which.represents the interests of the public and the consumer.My o?/n view is that the 1st December should be the date for announcing whatever policy is decided uponj that in the meantime the Royal Commission should effect any purchases.that they think desirable\ that in tho middle of January, when it is proposed to discontinue sugar rationing, their operations should be terminated altogether.) and that if the resumption of auxiliary Government purchases in 1921 is decided upon those purchases should be effected by the Ministry of Food to which such of the staff of the Koyal Commission as may be necessary could be transferred.CHARLES A, MuCURDY.MINISTRY OP POOD.30th October 1920.
DEO OK I E 8 L    OF  SUGAR.      &apos;Memorandum by tho chg.iman of the   oyal .0ommi ssloniThe RoyalCommission on the Sugar Supply has recently resume-.] consideration of the que&amp;tion    of the Decontrol of Sugar, and is of opinion that the conditions of the Sugar Supply have become such,as to.make.it possible to formulate proposals, definite in respect, of date and procedure.  &apos;;     The Commission has accepted the following principles as governing the procass of decontrol. -;,;-(a) . That the trade .in sugar should be freed from ..- all control at&quot;. the earliest moment&quot;compatible.-with an assurance that the Sugar Supply of . , the Country, can.be adequately maintained, &quot; &apos; :  ;.and without interrupt ionY-&apos; - (b)   That the process of decontrol must be gradual,&apos;  &apos;. &apos;        and cannot be effected : at a single stroke,&apos;. (o)   That decontrol of distribution&apos;must&apos; precede ::     deoontrol of-importation,   &apos;&apos; &apos;.(d)   That decontrol of importation must take into account the relation of British Refined and Imported Refined in the total of the sugar supply, and must; have- regard to the interests of what is an Important home industry, of a ... key oharacter, in the shape of Sugar Refining,. When the position was last considered (in July 1920) tho condition of the market was such that the Commission did not feel able to make definite recommendations in respect of the removal or relaxation of control over Imports; and confined itself to advocating the lightening of control over distribution. In the result its advice has been followed^ and control of distribution has slnoe been materially relaxed, and a definite date fixed (viz, January 1921) beyond whioh it is not to be continued in any systematic form,In the interval since July the conditions of the Sugar market  have developed in such a way as to make it now possible, in the opinion of the Commission, to oorae to close quarters with the question of the decontrol of imports also. The price of sugar, as measured by the f,o,bi quotations for&apos; paw Cubans in the New York market, has substantially fallen,-(from 22-1 cents to 9   cents) - and the evidence now available as regards the future, affords ground for hoping that, apart from unforeseen circumstances, the world1 s production will be sufficient to meet the probable demands.   Thus a position seems to have been reached in which the trade in sugar will hence-forward follow a normal course, no doubt with prices much beyond pre-war rates, and with no super-abundance of supply, but still one in whieh the relation of supply and demand will be normal In its operation: and if this be so, there no longer exists any justification for the intervention of the State, It follows that steps should forthwith be taken to put an end to that Intervention; and the purpose of the present Note is to indicate the various measures that, in the opinion of the Commission, should be adopted in order to effect that object, and the dates at whioh they should be put in force.
It lias throughout been recognized that the trade must be given adequate notice of the resumption of complete freedom of trade,    The Commission think that suoh intimation should now be given in general terms as proposed in paragraph 7.The trade of importing has two separate branches -the Raw and the Refined.   &apos; These 1 y/ork in competition, and a restoration of the ordinary machinery means a revival of competition between them.    The refiners who are interested in the import of Raws cannot be expected to be able to sustain their position if faced with a sudden and unrestricted competition]   and as the main part of the country&apos;s sugar supply is dependent upon them, it is clear that this branch of the trade will require to be assisted for a limited period. This, however, presents no particular difficulty, because the Commission has in sight,  and already purchased,, stocks sufficient to keep the refineries supplied with Raws up to the end of March, and these supplies could easily be supplemented, if it should be found necessary to prolong assistance to the Refiners beyond that time.     Thus the risk of loss in the pro-curing of raw material can for the time be shifted from the Refiners to the Commission, and for doing this we already have the authority of the Chancellor of the Exchequer who, at the time of the Budget, informed us of his willingness to accept the risk of loss on our operations, as an alternative to a reduction in the rate of duty.This being so the ground is cleared for a return to freedom of trade, and to that end the Commission submits tlx following recommendations j-That so soon as the present strike crisis has passed, a Notification should forthwith be issued to the effect,i. That as from the date of the notification all restrictions on importation will be removed.ii. That as from the same date restrictions on con-sumption by manufacturers will be entirely removed, and those on domestic consumption relaxed by an increase in the Ration to 1 lb, per head per week until January 1921, when they too will be entirely removed.iii. That as from the same date the only restriction on prices will consist, as now, in t he fact that any dealer or retailer found to be charging an excessive price on sugars supplied through the Commission will receive no further supplies from that source.lv. That the Sugar Commission will continue to provide Raw Sugar, in quantities sufficient to keep British Refineries in operation to their full capacity, until such time as it is satisfied that the conditions of the worldls market have reached a point at which the Refineries can reasonably be expected to provide themselves with the requisite raw material, without risk of interruption in the maintenance of the Sugar Supply of the country.For the information of the Government,&apos;it may be stated that the Commission holds stocks of Raws sufficient to keep the Refineries going until the end of March.    The Refinery    them-selves do not thirl: that they could guarantee the supply as from that date, and the uncertain conditions of the market make it impossible for anyone to form a confident opinion to the contrary. In these circumstances it seems undesirable to attempt to name now a definite date at which the Commission can hope to bring to a close its operations In this branch of the&apos;Sugar Supply.
It must await the developments in the market, whioh during the next few months are sure to be instructive;   but it will ho Id itself ready to take action the moment it thinks it can do so with an assurance that no failure to maintain supplies need be feared,(Signed) H,W. PRIMROSE.(Chairman).If- 1 -Royal Commission on the Sugar Supply, October, 1920./
